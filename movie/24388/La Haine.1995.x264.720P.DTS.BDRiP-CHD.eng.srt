1
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:14,498


2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,114
You murderers! It's easy to gun us down! We only got rocks!

3
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:29,285
H A T E

4
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,965
This film is dedicated to friends and family

5
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:45,426
who died while it was in the making.

6
00:00:47,178 --> 00:00:50,598
Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper?

7
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,684
On his way down past each floor,

8
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,228
he kept saying to reassure himself:

9
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,190
"So far so good..."

10
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:01,859
"so far so good..."

11
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,449
How you fall doesn't matter.

12
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,660
It's how you land!

13
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:48,252
More rioting in the projects outside the city.

14
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,421
Last night a mob of youths

15
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:55,050
attacked a police station in the Muguet projects.

16
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:58,220
Pitched battles left 14 officers injured.

17
00:04:58,387 --> 00:05:00,181
33 arrests were made.

18
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:04,018
A mall and nearby buildings were damaged by looters

19
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,562
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

20
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,649
Alleged police brutality sparked the riots 2 days ago.

21
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,612
A local teen was severely beaten under questioning.

22
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,405
The officer was suspended.

23
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:20,576
The victim, Abdel Ichaha, is in hospital

24
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,536
in critical condition.

25
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,747
Got a looter under arrest, a minor.

26
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,151
SAYlD: FUCK THE POLlCE

27
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:44,368
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

28
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:46,871
What? - Whadda ya mean "what"?

29
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:48,873
Can't fuckin' say hello?

30
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,958
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

31
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,043
Tell your bro to come out.

32
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,379
What for? - Tell him!

33
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:57,923
What for? - Just tell him!

34
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,508
What for?

35
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,760
Is this a TV game show?

36
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,472
Quit hollering!

37
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,267
You guys made enough noise last night!

38
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:11,562
You see me last night? l wasn't here.

39
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:12,813
Shut up!

40
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,648
Don't play dumb!

41
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,109
You'll burn next, asshole! - Idiot!

42
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:20,988
You gonna get him? - Don't asshole me, asshole!

43
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,449
You still there? Beat it!

44
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:26,994
If I wake him, he'll get mad. You try!

45
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:29,622
I hope the cops tan your hide!

46
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:46,847
Vinz...

47
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,975
Shut up, Sayid.

48
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:54,271
Shut up? Be nice or you're history, fuckface!

49
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,816
Go away. You stink!

50
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,985
You want to play this early? One...

51
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:00,945
Two...

52
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,279
Three.

53
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,281
You lose.

54
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,991
Fuck your sister.

55
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,911
I told you not to talk about her!

56
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:11,205
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

57
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:12,081
Jew boy!

58
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:15,668
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

59
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:18,087
I saw a cow. - What?

60
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:19,171
A cow.

61
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,422
Got some smoke?

62
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,049
ln the box.

63
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,515
Last night, during the riot, I dashed behind a building:

64
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:32,309
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

65
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,561
Really?

66
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,147
Stop smoking, your brain's fried!

67
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:38,732
Off my bed! I'll say you're taking drugs!

68
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,402
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

69
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:44,280
you'll drown in your blood!

70
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:45,406
Granma!

71
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,993
Get off the bed.

72
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:50,786
You get out.

73
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,121
Stay off my bed!

74
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:55,749
Get lost, you snitch!

75
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,835
Move it.

76
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:00,212
Watch your mouth with my sister! You'll skip temple!

77
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,756
Got any salt? - Respect your granma!

78
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:04,091
You my father?

79
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,509
What about Dad?

80
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:08,345
You my mother now?

81
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,431
Go to school!

82
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:12,433
It burned down.

83
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,518
Burned down! Savages!

84
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:18,189
Start that way and soon you'll skip temple!

85
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:20,274
Granma! - What?

86
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:21,609
I didn't burn the school!

87
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,653
And you don't go to temple!

88
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,947
You win! I surrender!

89
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:29,617
If everyone ran from an argument,

90
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:31,869
there'd be a stampede, already!

91
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:34,788
But we'd all be going the same way!

92
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,207
Mazeltov!

93
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,250
You talkin' to me?

94
00:09:56,268 --> 00:10:00,189
You talkin' to me, mothafucka!

95
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:14,411
...the guy says: "For cash, I'd even murder!"

96
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:17,957
He tells his friend: "I'd even waste you."

97
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:20,251
The friend freaks, so the guy says:

98
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,962
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

99
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,841
"l won't waste you for cash, I'll do it for free!"

100
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,385
What a killer line! "For free!"

101
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:33,180
"I'll waste you for free!" What a line, Vinz!

102
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:34,431
I got it the first time.

103
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,434
Tell your brother to come see me!

104
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:41,438
What a killer put-down! "I'll waste you for free!"

105
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,774
Shut up and gimme the joint.

106
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,655
A killer line! - Killer.

107
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:54,952
"I'd waste you for free." Can't do better than that!

108
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,582
Why you so uptight?

109
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,505
Mothafucka!

110
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:12,094
Bastards wrecked everything!

111
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:17,099
Check that!

112
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,565
I don't believe it!

113
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,486
How'd they get the car in?

114
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:31,906
The doorway's too narrow.

115
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:35,326
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

116
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:38,078
He must be pissed off.

117
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,415
Took him two years to get this gym!

118
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,184
Your dope's good, Vinz.

119
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:03,562
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

120
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,778
Don't bogart, Sayid.

121
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,613
Thought you quit smoking?

122
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,198
Me too.

123
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,369
What happened here?

124
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:19,870
Guess.

125
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,580
A fire?

126
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,251
You win the prize, Einstein!

127
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:26,919
Kiss mine, cousin!

128
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,547
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day.

129
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,091
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

130
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,385
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

131
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:35,803
You're the dick.

132
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,680
You know who did it?

133
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,640
I don't want to know.

134
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,561
How'd the car get in here?

135
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:46,397
The doorway's not big enough.

136
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:56,949
We dissed them, spit on them!

137
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,827
But the cops didn't move an inch.

138
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:04,123
Then the mothers stepped aside to make a path...

139
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:15,050
Then these plainclothes pigs came out with wooden clubs.

140
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:18,220
They hit a homeboy, like real bad!

141
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,182
Kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.

142
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:24,768
I kicked a pig right in the head!

143
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:36,947
That's a Yamaha.

144
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:39,742
More like your Mom on a Harley!

145
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:42,661
It's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.

146
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:45,372
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

147
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:46,999
Which Mohammed?

148
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,835
Farida's brother?

149
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:52,087
Farida with the driver's licence?

150
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:54,465
No, Farida from the supermarket.

151
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,219
Anyway, it was a scene.

152
00:13:58,385 --> 00:14:02,515
You should've been there Hubert. It was intense.

153
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,310
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

154
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,270
all the fists you can eat,

155
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,189
getting hell at home:

156
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:13,943
"Sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!"

157
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:19,824
Gimme a break! lt was war against the pigs, in living color!

158
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:23,244
I was trying to make some cash.

159
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,080
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

160
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:29,917
When a brother goes down, I stand up!

161
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,462
What brother? Do I know the guy?

162
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:38,509
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta I don't know.

163
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,888
Let's go.

164
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,266
I mean it!

165
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,143
Abdel's no gangsta.

166
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:51,147
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!

167
00:14:57,444 --> 00:14:59,822
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

168
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,031
Gimme one.

169
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,491
And go broke?

170
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:04,118
Don't make us cry!

171
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,996
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

172
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,248
Everyone pays the same!

173
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,709
Except Hubert, it's his building.

174
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:12,877
A buck?

175
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,087
A buck for one, OK two!

176
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,215
You're a drag!

177
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:19,758
You should try one.

178
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:22,136
Got a buck? - Yeah, for me!

179
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:23,012
Here.

180
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:26,432
No way, I'll remember this!

181
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,350
So remember. - Never forget.

182
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,646
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

183
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:36,901
How? With your sister?

184
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,403
Don't talk that way about her!

185
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,739
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

186
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:44,992
Sayid! Come back with that!

187
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,459
Got any change?

188
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,920
We're broke!

189
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,422
2 bits. - We're broke.

190
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,759
...The judge says I go to jail,

191
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,719
or do jobs for the City.

192
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:06,180
Community service? The pits!

193
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:09,350
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

194
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,352
You'd rather do time?

195
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,229
Your bro stole a dog!

196
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,689
Liar! - His mouth is full!

197
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:17,316
Put it on my tab.

198
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,360
Liar! Your nose is growing!

199
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:22,029
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

200
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,074
Beat it!

201
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:38,671
A.45!

202
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,590
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

203
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:45,803
We saw that movie together! It was a 9mm. Glock!

204
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,305
What? - No, it wasn't!

205
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:50,599
That was a Desert Eagle.

206
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:54,645
He shot at the truck!

207
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:57,064
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

208
00:16:57,523 --> 00:17:00,484
What are you talking about?

209
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:05,823
A cop lost his handgun during the riot.

210
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,616
That's a good one!

211
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:12,329
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.

212
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:15,624
But I'd like to know who found it!

213
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,418
No joke!

214
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,717
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

215
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:27,428
Everyone's been inside, except me.

216
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:30,848
A month for theft is pathetic!

217
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:32,516
Not in your league!

218
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:36,729
What league? I was never inside! - You got nabbed.

219
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:38,898
I quit in time!

220
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:41,025
Come look!

221
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,027
We got visitors.

222
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,321
Over here!

223
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,823
It's the mayor!

224
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:52,244
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!

225
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:57,082
Cut the stereo!

226
00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:01,086
Who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?

227
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,131
What's going on here?

228
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,550
Think you're in Disneyland?

229
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:09,970
You're not allowed up here. You gotta go down.

230
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:11,388
We're causing no trouble.

231
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:15,601
Still, you've got to get off the roof.

232
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:17,394
We like it up here.

233
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,813
Off the roof.

234
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:23,067
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

235
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:28,197
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

236
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,829
I'll handle this! - Forget it!

237
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:36,956
You can't stay here!

238
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:41,001
So fold your little tents, grab your chairs...

239
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,963
and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.

240
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,964
OK!

241
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,258
Who's gonna make us leave?

242
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:50,594
Your goons or you, in your little uniform?

243
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,055
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

244
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,018
Leave us alone!

245
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,566
Don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.

246
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:04,733
Now get lost!

247
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,235
Sitting duck!

248
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,529
Your mother drinks Bud!

249
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:19,039
Anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.

250
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:22,042
I'm staying. - You're going.

251
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,170
Let me stay, Nordeen.

252
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:26,463
What did I say? - You said go.

253
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,632
So what do you do? - I go!

254
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,011
OK, I'm going!

255
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:34,138
Vinz, c'mon!

256
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:37,475
Don't play tough guy!

257
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,977
You always wimp out!

258
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:00,581
...You see 'em in porn stores.

259
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,166
What are they called?

260
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,501
G-strings.

261
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,377
What? - G-strings, moron.

262
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:08,088
She had one on, I swear it.

263
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,007
I fucked her like an animal.

264
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:12,259
We were in the room...

265
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,931
she kept screaming for more.

266
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:20,684
Guy next door pounded the wall we were so noisy.

267
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,188
You dreamt you fucked her!

268
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:26,482
What?

269
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:29,443
You know the bitch? - I know her, she has AIDS.

270
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,279
Get outta here!

271
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,824
Hi, we're from TV. - What's this?

272
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,076
Were you in the riot last night?

273
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:38,828
Did you break things, burn cars?

274
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:42,581
We look like looters, lady? - I didn't say that.

275
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:44,959
So what do we look like? - Nothing special.

276
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,878
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.

277
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,755
We got work to do.

278
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:53,467
What kind of work? Stirring up shit?

279
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,803
For a juicy scoop! - No camera!

280
00:20:56,846 --> 00:21:00,182
Quit snooping in the 'hood, fuckface! Stop taping!

281
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:02,726
Quit taping, dickhead!

282
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,146
This ain't Thoiry!

283
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:09,817
What's with all the assholes today?

284
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:12,778
That fuckin' broad...

285
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,533
What's Thoiry?

286
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,035
A drive-in safari park.

287
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:23,122
This ain't no zoo!

288
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,542
Open up, WalMart!

289
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:29,712
You fuckin' jerks.

290
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:32,089
Talk nice, we're in France.

291
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:36,802
It's 1 p.m. and you're in bed?

292
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:41,932
What's with the hair net?

293
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,018
Lay off!

294
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:47,021
You a movie star, WalMart?

295
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:48,856
What's this shitty TV?

296
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,774
Watch where you sit!

297
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,276
Just sweat pants!

298
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:55,154
Where's the new TV?

299
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,489
It's too big to move.

300
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:59,867
I came by for my cash. Where were you?

301
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:03,078
I don't have it.

302
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:05,456
Don't you know what happened?

303
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,044
Go see what your pals did.

304
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,970
Foued's brother did that.

305
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:21,055
So what?

306
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,265
Give me his address.

307
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:26,811
Look what he did to my car!

308
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:28,813
Look what he did!

309
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:31,273
Just look!

310
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,442
Leave that alone.

311
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,863
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.

312
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,991
WalMart, it's just a car!

313
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:44,328
That's what you say!

314
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,330
You don't realize.

315
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,624
It's all I got.

316
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,751
Cut it out!

317
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,002
Leave that alone!

318
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,963
A homeboy's dying, fuck your car!

319
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:57,675
"A homeboy!" Big deal!

320
00:22:58,134 --> 00:22:59,593
You disgust me!

321
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,972
That car's all I have. It's my life!

322
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:07,309
They're showing the riot! - My car's more important!

323
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:08,727
Look, the riot.

324
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:10,646
Some TV! - Sure, bust it!

325
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:14,108
Fix the antenna! - I'm trying!

326
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:15,067
It's David!

327
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:17,027
How'd he get on TV?

328
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:19,947
I was over there, they missed me!

329
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:23,951
Fix it! I can't see a thing! - This TV sucks!

330
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:27,496
How'd that fucker get on TV?

331
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:30,791
Hey, gimme my money!

332
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,960
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

333
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,255
Gimme my coat and get outta my face!

334
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:38,466
You guys must be happy.

335
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:41,177
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

336
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:45,764
I hope the guy who finds it

337
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,309
uses it uptown, not here for once!

338
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:49,185
Forget it,

339
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:50,978
we'll get even!

340
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,527
You know that show, "Candid Camera"?

341
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:02,615
So this celebrity's sure he's been set up.

342
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:07,244
His buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.

343
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:09,788
The celebrity thinks they're out to get him.

344
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:12,625
He always eats in the same joint.

345
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,878
He's sure they'll film him there.

346
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:19,715
The others convince him there's a hidden camera.

347
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:23,511
He sees the TV truck, a camera behind the mirror

348
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:27,097
and the guy with him pretends to act weird.

349
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:30,768
The celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em,

350
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:34,980
pretending he hasn't noticed.

351
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:38,609
He thinks all hell will break loose.

352
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:43,489
But they just film him, jumpy, waiting for shit to happen.

353
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:44,990
So you see this guy...

354
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:47,284
Cut it out, Sayid!

355
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:49,870
Wasn't me! - Then who?

356
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,416
The celebrity's sweating, trying to act cool.

357
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,336
Each time the waiter passes

358
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,380
he thinks it'll happen.

359
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:03,384
Then a guy asks him for his autograph.

360
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,636
The celeb thinks it's a trick

361
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:08,264
and Starts ranting at the guy,

362
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:13,018
who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.

363
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:16,105
They Start fighting,

364
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,816
and the Candid Camera guys have to break it up.

365
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:21,819
It was a killer punch out.

366
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:24,572
Then what?

367
00:25:25,614 --> 00:25:27,449
That's all.

368
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,506
Who was the celebrity?

369
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:44,925
Dunno, but he was real famous.

370
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:46,677
I don't remember.

371
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:05,196
This looks like trouble. See ya.

372
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:22,630
WE'RE THE FUTURE

373
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:37,978
What did they want?

374
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:41,273
"Don't get mad, get even."

375
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:45,402
It's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.

376
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:47,988
Party time!

377
00:26:52,993 --> 00:26:55,454
We go visit Abdel in the hospital?

378
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,794
I gotta show you something...

379
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:12,930
That's real steel!

380
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,808
Get a load of it. - What a mother!

381
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:26,652
What'll you do with it?

382
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:27,862
Stop it, Hubert.

383
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,071
What you gonna do with it?

384
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:31,115
Depends if Abdel dies.

385
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,284
You gonna kill a cop?

386
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,077
Best way to get respect!

387
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,872
Smoking a cop will get you respect?

388
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:40,082
It'll even up the score.

389
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:43,419
I coulda got you a piece. - This one's special.

390
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,254
Think you're on a mission?

391
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:49,175
Well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!

392
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:52,595
Will it help Abdel? - It'll help us.

393
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,390
Stop fronting!

394
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:58,017
You pussy!

395
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,727
You're headed for big shit!

396
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,645
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

397
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:05,316
I don't want to know. - So don't ask!

398
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:11,113
One thing's sure...

399
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:14,575
With that piece you're the big man.

400
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,584
Hey, wait for me!

401
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,471
Fuck it...

402
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:44,146
What the fuck ya doin'?

403
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:47,274
OK, don't have a shit fit!

404
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,893
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

405
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,770
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

406
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:26,856
Sorry, I have my orders.

407
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:30,568
Just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.

408
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,194
He's our friend.

409
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,240
The docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.

410
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,033
We won't make trouble!

411
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,661
If I let you in,

412
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:42,997
I'll lose my job. - Sure, flunkey!

413
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,041
Tone it down. His family's here.

414
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,335
They need peace and quiet!

415
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:51,881
We're not as good as reporters?

416
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:53,299
Get going!

417
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,593
Hands off, man!

418
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,554
You gonna make me leave?

419
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:00,848
Gonna shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!

420
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,018
What's going on here?

421
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:05,728
Look at that fuckface!

422
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:09,315
We came to see our pal Abdel!

423
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,693
We won't leave till we see him.

424
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,862
Beat it, before I take you in.

425
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:16,113
Oh, yeah?

426
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:17,573
You shut up!

427
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:20,618
Move 'em out!

428
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,542
We can be nice or nasty. It's up to you!

429
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,087
Calm down!

430
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:35,216
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

431
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:37,468
I got the ringleader.

432
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:40,554
He did nothing. - I arrested the leader.

433
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,598
What leader? - He means Sayid.

434
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:43,641
Sure, Uncle Tom!

435
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,319
Things aren't bad enough.

436
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,696
You had to go to the hospital?

437
00:30:58,197 --> 00:30:59,448
They were only doing their job.

438
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,283
Doing their job?

439
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,119
Shut your yap, once and for all!

440
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:06,580
You shut yours! - Don't talk to me like that!

441
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:09,500
Same to you! - Shut up, will ya!

442
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,835
Shit!

443
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:12,628
You don't know a fucking thing!

444
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:13,879
What do you know?

445
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,881
Cut it out, asshole.

446
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,175
Watch your tongue! - If you watch yours!

447
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:22,138
The bastards who beat up Abdel will go to jail!

448
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:24,265
You're dreaming.

449
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,308
The cops at the hospital

450
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:28,477
protect Abdel and his family.

451
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:31,939
You just fuck things up!

452
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:35,568
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

453
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,321
Those cops are just protecting Abdel!

454
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,701
Most cops don't beat on you. They protect you!

455
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:47,371
Who protects us from you?

456
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,243
Never do it again!

457
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,994
Who writes your jokes?

458
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,205
Watch your tongue!

459
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:13,207
Watch your mother!

460
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:18,003
You ever trash me again,

461
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,214
you go to central lock-up.

462
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:23,175
Your brother can bail you out.

463
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:25,970
I didn't ask no favors. - I did it for your brother.

464
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,472
He'd rip you apart!

465
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:31,559
You're the ripper.

466
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:40,943
About the boxing gym: I can get you a City grant.

467
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:43,487
You'll get another gym.

468
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:48,075
Kids want to punch more than bags now!

469
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:52,288
It's hopeless. Once I could talk to the kids. No more.

470
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:57,418
And they know me! A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

471
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,212
An Arab in a police station doesn't last an hour!

472
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,925
I have to go. Try to keep cool.

473
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,720
Yeah, we'll try.

474
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,514
Outta my face, you fucker!

475
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,183
OK!

476
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:15,644
You shook his hand?

477
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:18,022
He's always been cool with me.

478
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,316
You don't shake a pig's hand!

479
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:25,237
You shoot him, I shake his hand! You're a fuckin'pain!

480
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:27,490
And you're out of it! Look!

481
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,867
I knew it!

482
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,869
You acted so weird at the hospital.

483
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,954
Take it easy. - Let me see.

484
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:36,874
You didn't tell us?

485
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,251
You didn't want to know!

486
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,337
Packing that! You retard!

487
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:44,215
I'm a big boy. Quit preaching!

488
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,342
I'll bust your chops!

489
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,844
Stop it!

490
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:52,681
You feel big with that gun! I'll kick your ass!

491
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,974
Like how?

492
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,977
Cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.

493
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:59,313
You shut up!

494
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:00,856
I'm splittin'.

495
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:02,775
So split!

496
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:05,486
Stay with us.

497
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,321
Sayid, let him split!

498
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,783
Don't go!

499
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,201
Back off.

500
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:18,332
What's with him?

501
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:23,337
Jerk thinks too much.

502
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,522
Where's Mom? - Explain this to me.

503
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,649
I can't now.

504
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:52,908
Well?

505
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:55,161
What's the answer?

506
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:56,287
I don't know.

507
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,998
You never know. - OK, I never know.

508
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:00,791
Hi, Mom.

509
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,459
How's the kid brother?

510
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,003
He's fine.

511
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:07,631
But your brother in jail isn't so good.

512
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,383
What's with Max?

513
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,760
He needs textbooks.

514
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,387
What for?

515
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:17,391
To get a high school diploma while he's inside.

516
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:22,354
He never made grade school!

517
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:25,858
Hands off the pots!

518
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:27,985
I didn't do nothing!

519
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:30,696
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

520
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:32,031
By the way...

521
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:35,493
There's the money for the power bill.

522
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,584
And my machine? - What machine?

523
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:47,254
My new sewing machine!

524
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:50,132
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.

525
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:53,010
Mine's ready to croak.

526
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,513
Patou, go study in your room.

527
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,349
Mom. - Don't argue.

528
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:01,936
Who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?

529
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:04,188
No, he's in Tower D.

530
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,981
I don't know him.

531
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:08,150
Could he get us textbooks?

532
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:10,069
That's not his line, Mom.

533
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:11,904
Officials now admit

534
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:15,825
that a policeman lost his gun in the riot last night.

535
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,118
It is still missing.

536
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:22,373
We asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous

537
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,750
in this explosive situation...

538
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,126
What a fuck up!

539
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:28,337
They burned down the gym.

540
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:35,052
I'm sick of the projects. I want out. It's getting worse.

541
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:38,347
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.

542
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,976
He's going wild, like Max.

543
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,187
I have to get out.

544
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:47,857
I have to leave this place.

545
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,652
If you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.

546
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,070
No credit for you.

547
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,824
My granma's a regular here! So I'm 2 bits short!

548
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:00,369
You're not your granma.

549
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:02,830
Hands off! - Just looking!

550
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:05,332
Got two bits? - How about one?

551
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,668
One OK? - One not OK.

552
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,839
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

553
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:13,591
No coins for you.

554
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,801
OK... Now what?

555
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:18,012
So what'll it be?

556
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:20,973
I saw you! - You saw what?

557
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,851
Gimme the red peppers. They're cheaper.

558
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,146
My granma'll kill me! She hates 'em.

559
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,942
So shoot the Chink, grab the green peppers!

560
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,069
It'll make granma's day!

561
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,348
Fuck, fuck the po-lice...

562
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,773
He's intense.

563
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,608
Killer!

564
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:02,361
A mother killer!

565
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,247
Sayid, check out the cow.

566
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:15,541
Fuck off with your cow!

567
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:18,544
I swear! - You said you'd cut my hair.

568
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:20,754
The same cow! I saw it!

569
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,256
You're the cow!

570
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:24,967
It was the same fuckin' cow!

571
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,844
You gotta believe me!

572
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,179
Shut up!

573
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:35,603
I'm Segnor Duck...

574
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:42,818
I fucka you, I fucka her, I fucka him...

575
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:46,405
OK Granma! So they're red peppers!

576
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,909
You know this cow business.

577
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:51,869
It's a weird trip.

578
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,623
Don't wreck my hair!

579
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:58,417
I gotta get laid! So watch it!

580
00:42:58,584 --> 00:43:00,503
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

581
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:01,337
A lawn?

582
00:43:01,504 --> 00:43:03,547
Sit your ass down.

583
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:06,383
It's hot, Vinz. - What?

584
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,385
A cop's piece is hot.

585
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:12,056
You said that already. Sit still, loser!

586
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,266
I'll whack you.

587
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,268
Don't move.

588
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,604
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

589
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:21,732
Wanna be the next Arab iced by the pigs?

590
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:22,191
Well, me neither.

591
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:24,318
Well, me neither.

592
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,487
So now you're an Arab!

593
00:43:26,654 --> 00:43:28,781
They think we're full of shit.

594
00:43:28,948 --> 00:43:32,076
But I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.

595
00:43:33,953 --> 00:43:35,204
Watch it!

596
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,872
It's cool.

597
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,125
ls this gun legit for a cop?...What'd you do?

598
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,169
Nothing, I swear it!

599
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,713
Why swear?

600
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,132
Because it's nothing.

601
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:47,550
I'm cold there!

602
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,219
It's cold in this room!

603
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:55,724
I'll even it out, it'll be great!

604
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:58,352
I got a date! Lemme see!

605
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:00,312
No fuckin' trust!

606
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:02,148
I didn't see!

607
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:03,607
You didn't look!

608
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:06,569
Trust me, dammit!

609
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:08,988
It's a nice hole.

610
00:44:09,155 --> 00:44:10,573
A nice what?

611
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:13,742
Trust me, or no haircut!

612
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:18,455
Look at me, Sayid!

613
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,291
Get outta here!

614
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,168
Don't get bummed out!

615
00:44:23,752 --> 00:44:25,880
It's the style in New York.

616
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:28,966
The killer cut, so stop whining!

617
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,050
New York?

618
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:33,888
They got hair like this in New York? I look punk!

619
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:34,889
Honest!

620
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,140
Don't laugh!

621
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,767
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

622
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:40,603
Outta my face!

623
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:43,647
No hard feelings, sucker!

624
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:49,320
Hey pooch, your master's an asshole!

625
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,204
There's your sister.

626
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:06,670
Why're you here? - And you?

627
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,964
I'm asking the questions!

628
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,550
You should be in school.

629
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,136
Get outta here!

630
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:17,765
Get lost, you cows.

631
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,434
You still here?

632
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:24,438
Get lost!

633
00:45:24,897 --> 00:45:26,524
You talk to my friends!

634
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,234
To Vincent.

635
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,238
The name's Vinz, not Vincent! And don't talk to him!

636
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:35,449
Get a move on! - Don't push!

637
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,872
Coming tonight? - Where?

638
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,000
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

639
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:47,461
Got tickets? - Freebies.

640
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:49,046
Killer!

641
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,550
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

642
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,970
Kids these days!

643
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:57,304
Check that!

644
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,121
Shit's happenin'!

645
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:17,885
Abdel's my brother, pig!

646
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:21,931
You're gonna pay!

647
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:24,642
Step on it!

648
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,435
It's stalled!

649
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:28,604
Outta the car, freeze!

650
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,826
Drop the gun!

651
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:47,748
Freeze!

652
00:48:08,978 --> 00:48:09,979
Get back!

653
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:12,481
Get the fuck out!

654
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:14,859
Riot cops are coming!

655
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,111
Get back, scum!

656
00:48:28,414 --> 00:48:30,291
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

657
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,504
This way!

658
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,049
Freeze!

659
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:44,430
You crazy?

660
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,143
Where were you?

661
00:48:49,768 --> 00:48:51,812
We fucked your mother!

662
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:01,155
I swear the pig was right in my sights.

663
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:04,325
I had him like I have you now!

664
00:49:05,784 --> 00:49:08,412
The sucker froze, shit his pants.

665
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,831
Without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!

666
00:49:10,998 --> 00:49:12,917
Right in the mother!

667
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,462
Hubert slugged him so hard he went into orbit!

668
00:49:16,629 --> 00:49:17,338
No!

669
00:49:17,505 --> 00:49:18,756
I swear it!

670
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,299
Slugged a pig?

671
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,260
You were great!

672
00:49:34,063 --> 00:49:37,191
THE WORLD lS YOURS

673
00:50:15,437 --> 00:50:17,356
Now what do we do?

674
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,113
I gotta call to get my bucks.

675
00:50:30,703 --> 00:50:32,663
Got Snoopy's address?

676
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,875
I'll wait, but not forever!

677
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:42,631
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk! I'd better collect!

678
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:45,801
You want some, Vinz?

679
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:47,219
Want some? - No.

680
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:48,471
You sure?

681
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:52,183
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

682
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:54,852
You're already chocolate!

683
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:03,110
Will you guys stop sulking?

684
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:07,781
Who's sulking? Not me!

685
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:09,658
Unbelievable! - Ask him!

686
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:11,410
A couple of kids!

687
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:15,581
Who's the kid? - 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

688
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:18,209
I'm 100% behind you!

689
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:21,337
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

690
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:26,634
Tell your buddy to back off! I never said I wanted to.

691
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:27,676
Yes, you did!

692
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:28,636
Yes! - No!

693
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:30,638
I didn't say that!

694
00:51:30,805 --> 00:51:32,848
I said if Abdel died,

695
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:35,768
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!

696
00:51:36,185 --> 00:51:38,187
Without my gun back there,

697
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:40,189
we'd have been history!

698
00:51:40,356 --> 00:51:42,566
My name's not Rodney King!

699
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,485
Not the same thing!

700
00:51:44,652 --> 00:51:47,988
Expect us to bring you gifts in jail?

701
00:51:48,697 --> 00:51:52,785
I expect nothing! Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

702
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:55,955
Go ahead, laugh!

703
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:57,957
Laugh!

704
00:51:58,123 --> 00:52:01,252
I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!

705
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:05,256
We live in rat holes, you do fuck-all to change things!

706
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:07,550
Neither do you!

707
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,136
You're my homeys, so I'll tell you:

708
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:12,263
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

709
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,306
I'll whack a pig!

710
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,895
So they know we don't turn the other cheek now!

711
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:22,189
Wow, what a speech!

712
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:25,192
HaIf Moses, haIf Mickey Mouse.

713
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,946
Forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.

714
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:31,824
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

715
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:32,741
Right!

716
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:35,578
If a cop dies, do all cops go away?

717
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:39,665
You're just one guy! You can't blow 'em all away!

718
00:52:39,874 --> 00:52:41,959
Who made you a preacher?

719
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,795
You know what's right and wrong?

720
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:47,840
Why do you side with the assholes?

721
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:50,134
Who's the asshole?

722
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:54,805
ln school we learnt that hate breeds hate!

723
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:58,100
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!

724
00:52:58,267 --> 00:52:59,894
Know what it taught me?

725
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,731
Turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka!

726
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:09,487
Bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop! We coulda been killed!

727
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,655
Nothing like a good shit!

728
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:16,994
You believe in God? That's the wrong question.

729
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,455
Does God believe in us?

730
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:23,250
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.

731
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:26,670
We were sent to Siberia together.

732
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:30,549
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

733
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:33,594
you travel in a cattle car.

734
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:37,848
You roll across icy steppes for days,

735
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:40,309
without seeing a soul.

736
00:53:40,476 --> 00:53:42,853
You huddle to keep warm.

737
00:53:43,145 --> 00:53:47,817
But it's hard to relieve yourself, to take a shit,

738
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:50,361
you can't do it on the train,

739
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:53,489
and the only time the train stops

740
00:53:53,656 --> 00:53:57,326
is to take on water for the locomotive.

741
00:53:57,493 --> 00:54:00,538
But Grunwalski was shy.

742
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,998
Even when we bathed together,

743
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:04,834
he got upset.

744
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,462
I used to kid him about it.

745
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:13,717
So, the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit

746
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,803
on the tracks.

747
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:19,348
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

748
00:54:19,515 --> 00:54:22,726
that he went off on his own.

749
00:54:22,977 --> 00:54:25,771
The train Starts moving,

750
00:54:25,938 --> 00:54:28,149
so everyone jumps on,

751
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:31,026
because it waits for nobody.

752
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:33,821
Grunwalski had a problem:

753
00:54:34,029 --> 00:54:37,074
he'd gone behind a bush

754
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:39,201
and was still shitting.

755
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,873
So I see him come out from behind the bush,

756
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:48,669
holding up his pants with his hands.

757
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:51,505
He tries to catch up.

758
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:53,883
I hold out my hand,

759
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:56,886
but each time he reaches for it

760
00:54:57,052 --> 00:54:58,804
he lets go of his pants

761
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:01,265
and they drop to his ankles.

762
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,392
He pulls them back up,

763
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,311
Starts running again,

764
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:08,939
but they fall back down,

765
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:11,567
when he reaches out for me.

766
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,279
Then what happened? - Nothing.

767
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,156
Grunwalski...

768
00:55:18,324 --> 00:55:20,159
froze to death.

769
00:55:22,244 --> 00:55:23,162
Good day.

770
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,879
Why'd he tell us that?

771
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:42,640
I got the address. I'll call you.

772
00:55:46,268 --> 00:55:48,020
Why'd he tell us that?

773
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:06,372
'xcuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.

774
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:08,624
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

775
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:12,628
My child's hungry, I need your spare change...

776
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:17,466
I wanna date with Mina!

777
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:19,552
I'll lasso her!

778
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:23,305
What d'you want? My dad's in jail,

779
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:26,016
my mom's in jail, my whole family is!

780
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,269
Get a job like everyone else!

781
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:31,105
What is this, Mardi Gras?

782
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:35,943
I want Mina!

783
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,867
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.

784
00:56:43,117 --> 00:56:47,121
I got out of a halfway house...

785
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,748
It's a block away.

786
00:56:50,124 --> 00:56:50,708
Thanks.

787
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,334
Have a nice day, sir.

788
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:53,586
Thanks.

789
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,551
The pigs are fuckin' polite around here!

790
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:03,929
Even called me sir!

791
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:17,651
Maybe he won the lottery!

792
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,700
Damn, it's locked!

793
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,078
What's his real name?

794
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:31,040
I only know him as Snoopy.

795
00:57:38,214 --> 00:57:41,091
Yes? - Sorry to bother you.

796
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:42,927
I'm looking for...

797
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:44,345
Snoopy.

798
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,181
It sounds weird. - Very funny!

799
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:51,310
The fucker hung up.

800
00:57:52,144 --> 00:57:53,395
You try.

801
00:57:53,562 --> 00:57:55,606
Why me? - Try!

802
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,192
Darkie and me will get shot at!

803
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:02,446
Hello. - Yes?

804
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:04,490

805
00:58:05,324 --> 00:58:07,409
No, but Charlie Brown is!

806
00:58:11,497 --> 00:58:14,250
You fucked it up, you asshole!

807
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:15,501
Stop that!

808
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,503
Sorry to bother you.

809
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:22,007
Our pal Snoopy lives here, we don't know his real name.

810
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:25,553
Stop ringing! You thinka da world is yours?

811
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,638
Unreal!

812
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:33,269
No, we're staying!

813
00:58:36,939 --> 00:58:38,941
So call the cops, you spic!

814
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:39,859
Sayid?

815
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,319
Snoopy?

816
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:45,156
What floor? - 5th.

817
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:46,490
We're coming!

818
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:50,870
Snoopy? Is no name!

819
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:52,872
You always make a trouble!

820
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:08,095
Were you followed? - No.

821
00:59:08,262 --> 00:59:09,972
No one? - Nobody!

822
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:11,390
You sure? - Why?

823
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:12,850
Because...

824
00:59:16,729 --> 00:59:17,313
You cool?

825
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,856
Great!

826
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,524
Check that kitchen.

827
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:22,485
Who's this dude?

828
00:59:24,403 --> 00:59:27,156
Nice space! You win the lottery?

829
00:59:27,323 --> 00:59:30,993
A guy loaned it to me. He ain't gettin' it back!

830
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,330
This is no apartment, it's a palace!

831
00:59:34,663 --> 00:59:35,664
I don't believe it.

832
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:38,250
Bitchin' apartment!

833
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:41,337
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

834
00:59:43,631 --> 00:59:45,466
This is Cousin Hubert!

835
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:47,426
We've met before!

836
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,929
Line of coke? - No.

837
00:59:50,095 --> 00:59:51,680
You sure? - No thanks.

838
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:54,600
A little line of coke?

839
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:57,394
No one for coke?

840
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,814
How's your bro? - OK.

841
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,732
Mean fuckin' dude!

842
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:04,193
He still a maniac? - And you?

843
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,362
Fuckin' A! Watch!

844
01:00:07,154 --> 01:00:08,572
So you got my cash?

845
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:10,115
My bread!

846
01:00:10,324 --> 01:00:13,702
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

847
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:15,996
Cut the bullshit!

848
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,501
Come get it.

849
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:23,420
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!

850
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:31,470
Hands off! - What?

851
01:00:31,637 --> 01:00:34,098
Not for kids! It's my gun!

852
01:00:36,058 --> 01:00:38,894
So what? I got a piece too.

853
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:41,939
Let's see!

854
01:00:42,815 --> 01:00:44,191
Whip it out.

855
01:00:48,237 --> 01:00:49,155
Fuck!

856
01:00:49,321 --> 01:00:50,656
Don't, Vinz!

857
01:00:50,865 --> 01:00:51,949
He knows guns.

858
01:00:52,158 --> 01:00:55,494
A snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

859
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:57,371
Watch it!

860
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,664
It's loaded.

861
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:00,916
Mean piece.

862
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:03,377
You're a gangsta.

863
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:06,297
It's for self-defense.

864
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,466
You into magic?

865
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:09,550
Watch.

866
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:11,093
One bullet.

867
01:01:15,264 --> 01:01:16,432
I missed.

868
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,142
You're nuts!

869
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,353
That's live ammo! - It's an old trick!

870
01:01:22,104 --> 01:01:23,189
Cool it.

871
01:01:23,397 --> 01:01:26,775
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

872
01:01:27,776 --> 01:01:28,944
Snoopy!

873
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:31,822
Wiggin' out, guys?

874
01:01:32,406 --> 01:01:34,158
You're nuts.

875
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:35,409
Gimme!

876
01:01:37,328 --> 01:01:38,496
Your turn.

877
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,581
Let's go, he's fried.

878
01:01:40,748 --> 01:01:41,665
Gonna do it?

879
01:01:42,249 --> 01:01:44,460
Gimme. - Do it!

880
01:01:46,086 --> 01:01:47,588
I did it, you do it!

881
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:49,632
Man, you want trouble?

882
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:51,509
Do it!

883
01:01:52,426 --> 01:01:53,677
Chill, guys!

884
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:57,389
Stop, Vinz!

885
01:01:57,556 --> 01:01:58,891
You aiming at me?

886
01:01:59,058 --> 01:02:00,893
You're off your head!

887
01:02:01,268 --> 01:02:02,937
You bet I'm aiming at you!

888
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:05,231
No one fucks with me!

889
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:08,609
I'm not some ass-wipe!

890
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:11,362
Wanna see a gun?

891
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:13,155
A fuckin' gun?

892
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:18,953
Sayid, get him out!

893
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,414
We're outta here!

894
01:02:25,543 --> 01:02:28,337
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

895
01:02:29,505 --> 01:02:30,506
Look!

896
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:37,721
That's right, asshole!

897
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:39,306
He was bluffing!

898
01:02:39,515 --> 01:02:43,769
Now I'll never get my cash!

899
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:47,064
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

900
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:51,986
Games? We got a pal in the hospital!

901
01:02:52,153 --> 01:02:54,155
Don't take on the world!

902
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:56,490
You got the wrong build!

903
01:02:56,657 --> 01:03:00,494
I'm not like you, Mr. Black Hercules, right?

904
01:03:00,703 --> 01:03:01,954
Go fuck yourself!

905
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:03,497
Fuck myself?

906
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:12,840
Alright, kids!

907
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:14,550
Who're you? - Easy!

908
01:03:14,717 --> 01:03:16,844
You had your fun!

909
01:03:17,052 --> 01:03:18,512
Easy!

910
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:23,350
Search them.

911
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:26,312
Fast work! In my 'hood, the cops come

912
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:28,689
a week after you're dead!

913
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,399
Hey, you!

914
01:03:31,525 --> 01:03:34,487
You together? - I don't know them.

915
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:36,113
Why you here?

916
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,240
I live with my aunt!

917
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:39,575
What's her name?

918
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:41,535
Mrs. Zyl...

919
01:03:43,037 --> 01:03:47,166
Got l.D.? - I'm on the level...

920
01:03:54,632 --> 01:03:56,592
Easy!

921
01:03:56,759 --> 01:03:58,761
Freeze!

922
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,513
Don't move, boy!

923
01:04:01,388 --> 01:04:02,389
You know him?

924
01:04:02,556 --> 01:04:04,016
Who? - Your pal.

925
01:04:04,183 --> 01:04:05,768
I don't know him.

926
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:09,522
We'll see about that, wise guy!

927
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:12,650
This is humiliating! - Too bad.

928
01:04:14,443 --> 01:04:15,986
What's this?

929
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,905
Good stuff!

930
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:20,699
I'm keeping it.

931
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:24,870
Afghan's the best.

932
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:27,373
Good buzz going up and down.

933
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,084
Same with Black Bombay.

934
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:32,503
Lebanese can really vary.

935
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,590
This is crap but I'll keep it...Well?

936
01:04:37,091 --> 01:04:40,261
The little fucker outran me. Take them in.

937
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:41,971
Get in the back. - Why me?

938
01:04:42,138 --> 01:04:43,514
Get in!

939
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:59,405
Listen, scumbag. You know what I think of you?

940
01:04:59,655 --> 01:05:01,657
You're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.

941
01:05:01,824 --> 01:05:04,118
I can't take a step

942
01:05:04,285 --> 01:05:08,664
without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.

943
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,293
So watch where the dog dumps you!

944
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:09,892
You're all alone!

945
01:06:10,518 --> 01:06:12,269
Far from the slums...

946
01:06:12,853 --> 01:06:14,271
and your looter pals.

947
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,691
Pick it up with your feet.

948
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:20,402
Like your people do back home.

949
01:06:21,695 --> 01:06:23,989
They're great with their feet.

950
01:06:25,491 --> 01:06:27,618
This is the hard part.

951
01:06:31,664 --> 01:06:35,000
OK, there's no big hurry.

952
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:37,378
In 2 hours, they may be free.

953
01:06:37,545 --> 01:06:39,380
Make the most of it.

954
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:45,636
How 'bout a bullet in the back of your head?

955
01:06:46,137 --> 01:06:47,972
A nice little bullet?

956
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:50,516
You gotta stop in time.

957
01:06:50,683 --> 01:06:53,060
You need self-control.

958
01:06:53,227 --> 01:06:54,854
Gotta be a pro.

959
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,690
This takes control.

960
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:01,402
Don't get mad! It won't last!

961
01:07:04,613 --> 01:07:07,449
You got something to say?

962
01:07:08,075 --> 01:07:11,287
Don't touch him!

963
01:07:11,704 --> 01:07:14,081
You know this one?

964
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,167
The Shanghai Squeeze.

965
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,419
It's an oldie.

966
01:07:20,379 --> 01:07:23,215
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

967
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:26,385
Fucker!

968
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:28,679
Don't hurt yourself!

969
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:31,182
Take it easy!

970
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:34,393
Don't get me aroused.

971
01:07:34,727 --> 01:07:36,854
You look like a bitch from behind!

972
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:40,524
A nice bitch to suck me off!

973
01:07:42,276 --> 01:07:43,736
Blow jobs!

974
01:07:44,028 --> 01:07:45,863
Bitches to suck my dick!

975
01:07:46,447 --> 01:07:49,283
That's the way. Then you relax!

976
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:52,286
But it's hard to stop in time.

977
01:07:52,453 --> 01:07:54,622
You gotta stay in control.

978
01:07:58,751 --> 01:07:59,919
That's the trick.

979
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,587
I like his face.

980
01:08:01,754 --> 01:08:02,755
He's cute.

981
01:08:03,339 --> 01:08:05,216
What was the name?

982
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:10,554
Are you cute? - Yes! I'm cute!

983
01:08:10,971 --> 01:08:13,641
I'm cute!

984
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:17,269
Which one? - He's Hubert.

985
01:08:17,436 --> 01:08:18,896
That's no Hubert!

986
01:08:19,063 --> 01:08:20,940
He's French, he's Sayid.

987
01:08:21,106 --> 01:08:22,983
Sayid? That's pretty!

988
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,237
Is Sayid a French name?

989
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,781
Aren't they pretty?

990
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,034
Take a good look!

991
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:36,205
The little guy's excited.

992
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:39,416
Leave him alone!

993
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:49,176
It's so easy to go too far!

994
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:52,429
But you mustn't! Though you're dying to!

995
01:08:53,139 --> 01:08:55,933
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?

996
01:08:58,769 --> 01:09:00,437
OK, let's go.

997
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:24,378
Sir!

998
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:26,422
We'll miss the last train!

999
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:27,840
Forget it.

1000
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:29,133
Bastard!

1001
01:09:29,341 --> 01:09:32,052
Did I talk to you?

1002
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:05,336
Yo, Vinz!

1003
01:10:06,879 --> 01:10:08,547
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

1004
01:10:08,714 --> 01:10:11,091
Dunno. They pissed me off tonight.

1005
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,761
You guys are always fussin'!

1006
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,626
Your sister's hot.

1007
01:10:46,335 --> 01:10:48,629
Shut up, asshole.

1008
01:10:49,171 --> 01:10:50,923
Sorry, but she's hot.

1009
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,967
You don't stand a chance.

1010
01:10:53,134 --> 01:10:55,177
Don't you try.

1011
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:58,722
Don't even look at her!

1012
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:00,516
Check the turn!

1013
01:11:00,683 --> 01:11:03,477
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

1014
01:11:03,644 --> 01:11:07,648
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

1015
01:11:19,451 --> 01:11:21,453
Brothers, I gotta make it

1016
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,914
by any means necessary

1017
01:11:24,123 --> 01:11:26,500
'cos my mind's playin' tricks on me.

1018
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:33,674
You won't let us in?

1019
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:35,634
Beat it!

1020
01:11:37,219 --> 01:11:41,515
That nigger bouncer never lets us in!

1021
01:11:41,682 --> 01:11:43,476
We know his bro for 10 years!

1022
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:46,854
And he still gives us shit!

1023
01:11:47,313 --> 01:11:49,064
Drives me crazy!

1024
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:52,151
What's up with the flare gun?

1025
01:11:53,235 --> 01:11:54,945
Where you going?

1026
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:56,822
Don't be a hot dog!

1027
01:11:59,617 --> 01:12:00,784
Stop!

1028
01:12:01,452 --> 01:12:04,330
I told you I'd be back!

1029
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:07,875
Not so big now, fuckface!

1030
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:11,337
You and your stinkin' club!

1031
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,799
Fuck your club!

1032
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:17,343
Goddam nigger!

1033
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,571
That cop made us miss it.

1034
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:40,449
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!

1035
01:12:54,046 --> 01:12:55,756
When's the next one?

1036
01:12:56,173 --> 01:12:57,591
Tomorrow morning.

1037
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:40,551
How much did Snoopy owe you?

1038
01:13:40,718 --> 01:13:41,469
What?

1039
01:13:41,677 --> 01:13:43,345
What'd he owe you?

1040
01:13:43,512 --> 01:13:44,763
One.

1041
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:47,141
$1,000? - No, $100.

1042
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:48,434
What?

1043
01:13:48,726 --> 01:13:50,978
All this shit for a lousy $100!

1044
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:53,898
It's the principle that counts.

1045
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,693
Principle!

1046
01:13:59,945 --> 01:14:02,406
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

1047
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:05,159
Roadrunner's a pussy.

1048
01:14:05,451 --> 01:14:07,912
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

1049
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:10,372
Fuck you and Tweetie!

1050
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:13,667
I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!

1051
01:14:13,834 --> 01:14:17,213
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.

1052
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:19,715
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

1053
01:14:19,882 --> 01:14:23,552
Can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.

1054
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:25,346
'Cause you listen?

1055
01:14:25,513 --> 01:14:28,057
You got it all wrong.

1056
01:14:28,224 --> 01:14:32,353
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.

1057
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:34,230
That's bullshit!

1058
01:14:34,522 --> 01:14:37,358
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

1059
01:14:37,983 --> 01:14:39,318
Come again?

1060
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:42,279
Who does he fuck? Me?

1061
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:44,406
Anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.

1062
01:14:44,573 --> 01:14:46,200
A black brother?

1063
01:14:46,617 --> 01:14:47,785
Full of shit!

1064
01:14:48,494 --> 01:14:50,871
Shall we, gentlemen?

1065
01:14:51,038 --> 01:14:52,873
What can we lose?

1066
01:15:00,714 --> 01:15:04,301
It's positively frightful!

1067
01:15:11,308 --> 01:15:13,018
Is this guy famous?

1068
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,731
He will be when he grows up!

1069
01:15:35,082 --> 01:15:38,586
There's Champagne, Cinzano, Bogardi...

1070
01:15:38,794 --> 01:15:40,588
I don't drink. - I mean Bacardi.

1071
01:15:40,754 --> 01:15:41,755
Outta my way.

1072
01:15:43,299 --> 01:15:44,717
I want peanuts.

1073
01:15:48,262 --> 01:15:49,722
Cheers, Charles!

1074
01:15:50,306 --> 01:15:52,183
Hey, Charles!

1075
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:55,144
Behave, asshole!

1076
01:15:57,605 --> 01:16:00,149
Let 'em through, Sayid!

1077
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:03,152
Check out the babes!

1078
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:05,321
That's what I call women!

1079
01:16:06,197 --> 01:16:08,157
The sister is hot.

1080
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,868
Do me a favor.

1081
01:16:11,035 --> 01:16:12,745
I'm not going!

1082
01:16:13,078 --> 01:16:15,623
Who bought the tacos last week?

1083
01:16:15,789 --> 01:16:17,917
You owe me one.

1084
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:19,418
Get me the sister.

1085
01:16:19,752 --> 01:16:20,920
Awright.

1086
01:16:21,837 --> 01:16:23,631
There's just two!

1087
01:16:23,797 --> 01:16:25,299
Who cares? - Shut up!

1088
01:16:25,466 --> 01:16:27,635
Get her for me, Hubert!

1089
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:36,227
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

1090
01:16:36,727 --> 01:16:40,856
My friend's a romantic, he's really shy.

1091
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:43,400
He'd love to meet you.

1092
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:45,027
That's him.

1093
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:48,155
What d'ya say?

1094
01:16:48,322 --> 01:16:50,616
Look what you did to me!

1095
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:53,160
He's really cool.

1096
01:16:53,327 --> 01:16:56,664
He's too nice. - OK, then!

1097
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:58,165
C'mon Sayid!

1098
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,376
Hold this.

1099
01:17:02,253 --> 01:17:04,421
Haven't we met before?

1100
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:06,006
Don't I wish!

1101
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:07,424
Hi, girls!

1102
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:08,259
I'm Sayid.

1103
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:12,763
Please don't lean on the painting.

1104
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,014
You're the painting!

1105
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:16,725
I'm good at what?

1106
01:17:16,892 --> 01:17:18,060
Guess, babe!

1107
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:20,104
We heard you were shy!

1108
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:23,691
Shy? That's my middle name!

1109
01:17:24,483 --> 01:17:27,027
What's your number? We'll go out.

1110
01:17:27,236 --> 01:17:29,697
You're all alike!

1111
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:32,032
He said you wanted to talk.

1112
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:34,702
Talk? What about?

1113
01:17:36,078 --> 01:17:38,873
Lighten up! We were ready to talk,

1114
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:43,127
but with your attitude, how can we respect you?

1115
01:17:43,294 --> 01:17:46,672
Who are you? The Wonderbra bitch?

1116
01:17:46,839 --> 01:17:49,300
Who asked you? - I'm asking you!

1117
01:17:49,508 --> 01:17:51,135
He's nuts.

1118
01:17:51,552 --> 01:17:53,888
What are you staring at?

1119
01:17:54,388 --> 01:17:55,639
Got a screw loose?

1120
01:17:55,806 --> 01:17:57,808
You're the screw.

1121
01:17:59,602 --> 01:18:02,521
Stop! - What's wrong with you?

1122
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:06,817
Leave us alone, we didn't ask you over!

1123
01:18:06,984 --> 01:18:08,694
Gentlemen, please!

1124
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:10,905
It's cool, Pops!

1125
01:18:11,071 --> 01:18:14,909
Nobody's been hurt! What's your beef?

1126
01:18:15,117 --> 01:18:17,953
Keep your heads, please. - Please what?

1127
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:20,206
Let's go!

1128
01:18:20,748 --> 01:18:22,374
Pretty please!

1129
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:25,002
Let's all calm down!

1130
01:18:25,336 --> 01:18:26,587
Stop that!

1131
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:28,130
Stop your friend.

1132
01:18:28,297 --> 01:18:31,050
You're not my friend! Fuck you!

1133
01:18:33,177 --> 01:18:34,512
Know what?

1134
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:37,097
Go suck cocks in hell!

1135
01:18:37,264 --> 01:18:40,643
With your mothers! - You're all ugly!

1136
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:43,354
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!

1137
01:18:46,482 --> 01:18:48,692
Have fun, mothafuckas!

1138
01:18:51,987 --> 01:18:53,405
lTroubled youth!

1139
01:18:53,572 --> 01:18:55,491
We shoulda swiped a bottle.

1140
01:18:55,658 --> 01:18:58,661
I got the sucker's charge card!

1141
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:01,497
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

1142
01:19:01,664 --> 01:19:03,749
Like riding a bike: you don't forget.

1143
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:06,460
Mr. David Moe?

1144
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:10,256
He's not here?

1145
01:19:11,006 --> 01:19:12,508
We keep it for him!

1146
01:19:12,675 --> 01:19:14,426
Give it to me.

1147
01:19:16,262 --> 01:19:18,013
What's the score?

1148
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,348
Killer!

1149
01:19:19,765 --> 01:19:21,559
Know what I'm saying?

1150
01:19:22,935 --> 01:19:25,062
Your name's not David!

1151
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:27,189
And cabs don't take plastic.

1152
01:19:27,356 --> 01:19:28,607
Just this once.

1153
01:19:28,816 --> 01:19:30,943
Gimme a break!

1154
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:36,866
You fart?

1155
01:19:37,283 --> 01:19:38,701
It was you. Who else?

1156
01:19:38,868 --> 01:19:41,245
It stinks. Had to be you.

1157
01:19:41,412 --> 01:19:42,496
That's not my stink.

1158
01:19:42,663 --> 01:19:44,165
I know your farts.

1159
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:46,792
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

1160
01:19:52,548 --> 01:19:53,549
Who farted?

1161
01:19:53,757 --> 01:19:55,092
He did. - He did.

1162
01:19:56,886 --> 01:19:58,762
Can't you tell?

1163
01:20:00,347 --> 01:20:01,724
It was him.

1164
01:20:01,891 --> 01:20:04,101
Your ass reeks.

1165
01:20:05,102 --> 01:20:08,689
Motherfucking goddam steering wheel!

1166
01:20:08,856 --> 01:20:10,983
Cut the poetry

1167
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,027
and pull the thing!

1168
01:20:13,194 --> 01:20:16,614
Jean-Claude does this in five seconds flat.

1169
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:17,865
Which Jean-Claude?

1170
01:20:18,073 --> 01:20:19,074
The mailman?

1171
01:20:19,283 --> 01:20:22,870
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

1172
01:20:23,037 --> 01:20:25,498
This guy got 2 years for car theft.

1173
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:27,917
Move it, bust the fucker!

1174
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:31,337
Use your foot!

1175
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:54,318
Don't be a sissy.

1176
01:20:54,485 --> 01:20:56,862
Who's a sissy?

1177
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:03,577
Relax, Max.

1178
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:16,924
"Night of the Living Car!"

1179
01:21:18,926 --> 01:21:20,803
The wipers!

1180
01:21:25,516 --> 01:21:27,476
Rip open that plastic box.

1181
01:21:27,643 --> 01:21:29,395
Open sesame!

1182
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:35,568
Connect the green wire to the red one.

1183
01:21:35,734 --> 01:21:38,112
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

1184
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:40,656
How'd they do it in on TV?

1185
01:21:40,823 --> 01:21:43,033
Fuck TV!

1186
01:21:44,118 --> 01:21:46,954
Start the mother!

1187
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,042
Who the fuck's he?

1188
01:21:54,295 --> 01:21:56,088
Freaked me out!

1189
01:21:57,173 --> 01:21:58,841
Who the fuck are you?

1190
01:21:59,008 --> 01:22:00,676
Huh? - What you doin'?

1191
01:22:00,843 --> 01:22:01,927
Nothing.

1192
01:22:02,136 --> 01:22:03,929
So go somewhere else.

1193
01:22:04,096 --> 01:22:06,098
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

1194
01:22:06,265 --> 01:22:07,433
It's my wife...

1195
01:22:07,641 --> 01:22:08,726
What about her?

1196
01:22:10,186 --> 01:22:11,061
She left me.

1197
01:22:12,021 --> 01:22:14,148
Do we fuckin' care?

1198
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,277
Don't wait for the law, Start it.

1199
01:22:18,444 --> 01:22:20,237
Move!

1200
01:22:20,404 --> 01:22:22,615
The red wire to the green wire.

1201
01:22:22,781 --> 01:22:25,451
Lay off, that's for the horn!

1202
01:22:25,618 --> 01:22:26,785
Try the blue, jerk!

1203
01:22:27,745 --> 01:22:31,165
You do it! If you're so smart.

1204
01:22:31,332 --> 01:22:32,500
I'll kill you!!

1205
01:22:34,418 --> 01:22:36,086
You're a drag.

1206
01:22:37,004 --> 01:22:39,215
That wire's for the horn.

1207
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:40,841
No, that's the horn!

1208
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:44,845
Sayid's right.

1209
01:22:45,012 --> 01:22:46,931
You see?

1210
01:22:47,097 --> 01:22:50,017
Who was right? We do it my way!

1211
01:22:50,184 --> 01:22:51,811
Gimme some metal!

1212
01:22:51,977 --> 01:22:53,437
Move it!

1213
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:56,732
You're a good guy. What's your name?

1214
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:00,528
You got a name?

1215
01:23:03,072 --> 01:23:05,699
At least we put it to good use!

1216
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:09,620
Ready? Watch this.

1217
01:23:22,633 --> 01:23:24,468
Anyone know how to drive?

1218
01:23:24,885 --> 01:23:27,429
Vinz does. - Wait a second.

1219
01:23:27,596 --> 01:23:30,266
I never learned, I got no licence.

1220
01:23:30,516 --> 01:23:32,643
He does. He was in the Army.

1221
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,104
The Navy! I can't drive.

1222
01:23:35,688 --> 01:23:36,939
I can!

1223
01:23:37,148 --> 01:23:38,524
Shut up!

1224
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:41,402
Vinz? - What?

1225
01:23:41,569 --> 01:23:45,698
You took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes.

1226
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:49,076
Not the same thing!

1227
01:23:49,243 --> 01:23:51,412
That was different. It was... uh...

1228
01:23:51,579 --> 01:23:54,039
It was an automatic...

1229
01:23:54,582 --> 01:23:55,499
More like a dream!

1230
01:23:58,252 --> 01:24:00,254
You guys are so lame!

1231
01:24:03,174 --> 01:24:04,800
Now what?

1232
01:24:06,552 --> 01:24:09,889
Sorry, but a cop car's coming.

1233
01:24:10,055 --> 01:24:12,099
Where? - That's a cop car.

1234
01:24:12,266 --> 01:24:13,267
It's real close.

1235
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,397
On three, we're outta here, OK?

1236
01:24:19,023 --> 01:24:19,732
Ready?

1237
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:20,399
Three!

1238
01:24:27,865 --> 01:24:29,366
Freeze!

1239
01:24:32,369 --> 01:24:35,164
Out of the way!

1240
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:43,172
"You down with OCB?"

1241
01:24:43,339 --> 01:24:45,007
"Yeah, you know me..."

1242
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:46,759
"You're down with OCB?"

1243
01:24:46,926 --> 01:24:48,803
"Yeah, you know me..."

1244
01:24:49,053 --> 01:24:50,930
"Yeah, you know me..."

1245
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:54,892
Sometimes you feel so fuckin' small...

1246
01:24:55,434 --> 01:24:57,436
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

1247
01:24:57,603 --> 01:25:00,523
"The early bird catches the worm."

1248
01:25:00,689 --> 01:25:03,150
"A stitch in time saves nine."

1249
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,320
"Haste makes waste."

1250
01:25:06,487 --> 01:25:08,948
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

1251
01:25:09,114 --> 01:25:12,284
I save that one for special occasions.

1252
01:25:12,993 --> 01:25:15,371
Holy fuck!

1253
01:25:15,955 --> 01:25:18,082
I'm wasted.

1254
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:20,501
Your shit is dope!

1255
01:25:22,503 --> 01:25:23,587
Sayid, watch it!

1256
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:26,090
He's a big boy!

1257
01:25:26,298 --> 01:25:28,217
Spray cans! - You're the can!

1258
01:25:29,135 --> 01:25:32,638
What was that old guy in the john trying to say?

1259
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:36,350
Talked about God and shitting. What was the point?

1260
01:25:36,517 --> 01:25:37,935
I see skinheads.

1261
01:25:38,102 --> 01:25:39,353
You're the skinhead.

1262
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,437
Fuck Nazis!

1263
01:25:40,604 --> 01:25:43,065
The point is: God's inside you,

1264
01:25:43,274 --> 01:25:44,817
so He helps you dump!

1265
01:25:44,984 --> 01:25:47,278
God loves your bowels.

1266
01:25:47,486 --> 01:25:48,571
Pass the joint.

1267
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:53,409
Check this shit out:

1268
01:25:54,493 --> 01:25:58,539
"Pinhead is to skinhead, as teeny is to weenie."

1269
01:25:58,706 --> 01:26:00,916
Get my drift?

1270
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,793
Out of the way.

1271
01:26:13,095 --> 01:26:17,016
Vinz, Know the one about the guy falling off a skyscraper?

1272
01:26:17,308 --> 01:26:20,352
On the way down he says to himself:

1273
01:26:20,519 --> 01:26:25,107
"So far so good... so far so good..."

1274
01:26:27,776 --> 01:26:29,904
I heard it with a rabbi.

1275
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:34,783
Like us in the projects. So far so good,

1276
01:26:35,326 --> 01:26:36,785
but how will we land?

1277
01:26:37,369 --> 01:26:40,748
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.

1278
01:26:44,418 --> 01:26:46,795
Watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.

1279
01:26:52,927 --> 01:26:55,179
That only works in movies.

1280
01:26:55,346 --> 01:26:56,722
Mothafucka!

1281
01:26:56,889 --> 01:26:58,140
You in a movie?

1282
01:26:58,349 --> 01:27:00,142
In a porn flick with your mother!

1283
01:27:00,309 --> 01:27:02,061
Look who's talking!

1284
01:27:02,228 --> 01:27:05,564
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

1285
01:27:07,608 --> 01:27:09,735
You're the carrot!

1286
01:27:18,744 --> 01:27:20,871
THE WORLD IS YOURS

1287
01:27:32,758 --> 01:27:35,678
THE WORLD IS OURS

1288
01:27:43,352 --> 01:27:47,106
How did they get the car in the gym?

1289
01:27:47,273 --> 01:27:49,817
Search me...Ask God!

1290
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:50,734
Very funny.

1291
01:28:00,286 --> 01:28:03,414
Look at those sheep in the system.

1292
01:28:03,581 --> 01:28:08,586
They look cute in their fancy leather jackets.

1293
01:28:08,752 --> 01:28:10,379
But they're scumbags.

1294
01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:14,091
They ride escalators, carried by the system.

1295
01:28:14,675 --> 01:28:17,011
They vote far right, but aren't racists.

1296
01:28:17,178 --> 01:28:20,347
They can't move without escalators.

1297
01:28:20,514 --> 01:28:22,141
The worst!

1298
01:28:25,144 --> 01:28:26,520
Racist!

1299
01:29:05,768 --> 01:29:07,603
WAR lN BOSNlA

1300
01:29:16,028 --> 01:29:18,072
ABDEL lCHAHA DlES

1301
01:29:42,012 --> 01:29:43,514
Where's Vinz?

1302
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,566
Mothafucka!

1303
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:13,961
What?

1304
01:30:16,172 --> 01:30:17,423
Dumb fuck!

1305
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:20,509
What did I do?

1306
01:30:22,803 --> 01:30:23,721
Why hit me?

1307
01:30:27,558 --> 01:30:29,101
What did I do?

1308
01:30:31,103 --> 01:30:32,855
What'd I do, asshole?

1309
01:30:33,022 --> 01:30:34,565
You suck big time!

1310
01:30:34,732 --> 01:30:36,317
So what'd I do?

1311
01:30:36,484 --> 01:30:38,694
Help me, Sayid! Please.

1312
01:30:38,861 --> 01:30:41,614
Help you what? What'd I do?

1313
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,032
Abdel's dead now!

1314
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,034
He's sick of your shit!

1315
01:30:45,201 --> 01:30:46,285
What shit?

1316
01:30:46,494 --> 01:30:48,579
What the fuck I do?

1317
01:30:49,497 --> 01:30:53,167
You wanna kill a pig, go right ahead.

1318
01:30:54,668 --> 01:30:56,378
But you're on your own.

1319
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:58,339
We're outta here.

1320
01:31:02,426 --> 01:31:03,928
Get lost.

1321
01:31:04,428 --> 01:31:06,055
Both of you!

1322
01:31:07,681 --> 01:31:10,351
I don't need you!

1323
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:16,774
I know who I am and where I come from!

1324
01:31:16,941 --> 01:31:19,401
So go home and shut up!

1325
01:31:19,568 --> 01:31:21,946
Fuck your mother!

1326
01:31:39,004 --> 01:31:40,339
Don't bug me, Sayid.

1327
01:31:40,506 --> 01:31:42,133
Think we should've...

1328
01:31:45,761 --> 01:31:47,096
Just what we need!

1329
01:31:47,263 --> 01:31:48,430
A nigger!

1330
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:53,102
You're the fucker who dissed us from the roof!

1331
01:31:53,269 --> 01:31:55,396
The gang banger from the roof?

1332
01:31:55,604 --> 01:31:58,274
Let's see you fight!

1333
01:32:02,027 --> 01:32:03,445
Hold him!

1334
01:32:08,284 --> 01:32:10,828
Come back!

1335
01:32:11,036 --> 01:32:12,746
You fuckin' asshole!

1336
01:32:12,913 --> 01:32:13,914
I done nothing!

1337
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:15,791
Faster than a speeding bullet?

1338
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,252
I done nothing!

1339
01:32:18,961 --> 01:32:20,212
Check it out!

1340
01:32:21,797 --> 01:32:23,048
Whadda you say?

1341
01:32:31,891 --> 01:32:34,185
Get the fuck in there!

1342
01:32:44,278 --> 01:32:45,738
Whatcha gonna do?

1343
01:32:48,032 --> 01:32:49,867
You think I'm all talk?

1344
01:32:50,034 --> 01:32:52,036
I'm all talk?

1345
01:32:54,371 --> 01:32:57,958
Watch! Don't try and stop me!

1346
01:32:59,293 --> 01:33:01,629
Vinz, don't do it! - Let him!

1347
01:33:02,922 --> 01:33:04,548
Do your good deed!

1348
01:33:05,299 --> 01:33:06,300
Shut up!

1349
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:08,511
There are good cops.

1350
01:33:08,677 --> 01:33:11,680
But the only good skinhead is a dead one!

1351
01:33:12,181 --> 01:33:13,682
Shoot him.

1352
01:33:13,849 --> 01:33:17,186
We took your shit all day. Fuckin' shoot him!

1353
01:33:17,895 --> 01:33:19,146
You got the piece.

1354
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:24,401
Shoot!

1355
01:33:27,029 --> 01:33:27,655
Shoot!

1356
01:33:32,368 --> 01:33:33,828
Fuck his mother!

1357
01:33:34,203 --> 01:33:35,287
Shoot!

1358
01:33:38,624 --> 01:33:41,877
Abdel's dead! Get even, for fuck's sake!

1359
01:33:42,044 --> 01:33:43,838
Do it for Abdel!

1360
01:33:48,092 --> 01:33:49,093
Shoot!

1361
01:33:59,478 --> 01:34:01,480
Get outta here!

1362
01:34:30,426 --> 01:34:31,969
See ya tomorrow.

1363
01:34:45,191 --> 01:34:46,442
Take it.

1364
01:34:50,696 --> 01:34:52,364
Gonna sing a love song?

1365
01:34:52,531 --> 01:34:53,908
Go home, loser.

1366
01:34:54,074 --> 01:34:57,119
Let's go, Vinz.

1367
01:34:57,328 --> 01:34:58,746
Later, Hubert.

1368
01:34:59,622 --> 01:35:01,540
Hear the one about the nun?

1369
01:35:01,707 --> 01:35:04,168
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

1370
01:35:04,376 --> 01:35:07,880
and walks up to a nun in this big black cape.

1371
01:35:08,047 --> 01:35:11,675
Wham! He slugs her in her teeth. She goes down

1372
01:35:11,842 --> 01:35:14,512
and he keeps on pounding her.

1373
01:35:16,263 --> 01:35:18,516
After about 5 minutes he stops,

1374
01:35:18,891 --> 01:35:21,268
looks at her and says:

1375
01:35:21,477 --> 01:35:23,479
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

1376
01:35:23,646 --> 01:35:25,856
That's a killer!

1377
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:28,234
He thought the nun was Batman!

1378
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,611
I heard it with a rabbi.

1379
01:35:31,695 --> 01:35:32,696
Over here, you!

1380
01:35:33,113 --> 01:35:34,490
What's the matter?

1381
01:35:35,074 --> 01:35:36,325
I know you!

1382
01:35:39,078 --> 01:35:40,579
You were on the roof!

1383
01:35:52,299 --> 01:35:53,884
What're you doin'?

1384
01:35:55,678 --> 01:35:57,555
Got a problem, you fuck?

1385
01:35:58,055 --> 01:36:00,057
Scared without your pals?

1386
01:36:00,975 --> 01:36:02,476
Not so tough now!

1387
01:36:02,643 --> 01:36:04,937
Look at him!

1388
01:36:32,089 --> 01:36:34,341
It's about a society falling...

1389
01:36:34,508 --> 01:36:38,721
On the way down it keeps telling itself:

1390
01:36:39,013 --> 01:36:40,848
"So far so good...

1391
01:36:41,724 --> 01:36:43,517
"so far so good...

1392
01:36:44,477 --> 01:36:46,604
"so far so good..."

1393
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:50,107
How you fall doesn't matter.

1394
01:36:51,692 --> 01:36:53,360
It's how you land!
