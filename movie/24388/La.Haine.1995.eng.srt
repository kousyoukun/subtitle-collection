00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:20,601
What do you think?

126
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,311

Anyway,

So why did you bust a gut
to get it open?

131
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,070
The dickhead
thought it was worth it.

132
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,122
Youre the dickhead!
Do you know who did it?

133
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,456
I dont want to.

134
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:44,121
How did they get the car in?

135
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,166
The doors arent big enough.

136
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,634
Vinz!

137
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:57,639
We were swearing at them,
spitting on them, everything.

138
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:00,423
But the filth didnt move a muscle.

139
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:05,222
Then they leapt into action,
makingthis passageway...

140
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,771
This fucking passageway,

141
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:15,561
andthey waded in
with pickaxe handles...

142
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:18,866
You see this?
Then it went fucking wild!

143
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:21,448
Once, twice...
Then we tore into them!

144
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:25,742
Bang! I took one of the fuckers out,

145
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:27,155

Farida, who just got her licence?

152
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:54,890
No, the one who works
on the market.

153
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,650
Oh, right.

154
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,062
Anyway, you should
have been there.

155
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,187
Especially you, Hubert.
It was wicked.

156
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:04,362
- Vinz!
- Hi.

157
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,946
Getting tear-gassed, banged up,

158
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,903

159
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,863
and then murdered by my folks...

160
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,780
I dont see the big attraction!

161
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,619

Were not doing any harm.

00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:16,252
Thats not the point.
You have to go down, end of story.

She couldnt get enough of it.

276
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:20,854
We were making so much noise

Its all I own.

322
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:52,491
- Stop it...
- Leave them alone!

323
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,576
Abrothers in hospital...

324
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:57,908
<i>What do you mean, a brother?
Hes not my problem. That is!</i>

325
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,083
You disgust me!

326
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,495
Its all Ive got, its my life.
50,000francs.

327
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:04,708
Hey, the riots!

328
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,709
My problem is my car.

329
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:10,497
- Look, the riots!
- This crap oldtelly...

330
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:12,047
Thats right, break it!

331
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:14,633
Hang on, Im doing my best.

332
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:15,713
Look, its David!

333
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:17,806
How did he get filmed?

334
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,765
I was right next to him,
they didnt film me.

335
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,217
I cant see anything.

336
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:25,311
What can I do? Its shit!

337
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:27,764
How did he get filmed?

338
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:31,320
Hey, my money, Dixons.

339
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,569
Asterix has got your money.

340
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,698
Get off my jacket,
youll make it stink!

341
00:23:36,908 --> 00:23:39,114
I bet youre happy, eh?

342
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:41,900
Apig lost his gun on the estate.

343
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:46,323
I hope that whoever finds it

344
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,867
goes and burns down Paris
for a change.

345
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,576
Dont worry! Were going
to burn the bastards down!

346
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,959
You know that programme
where they trick people?

347
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:03,170
They hadthis famous bloke on,
and he was on his guard, right?

348
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:07,809
His mate had organised it all
with the hidden camera people,

349
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:10,343
so the famous bloke
would be suspicious.

350
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:13,135
This bloke eats
in the same restaurant every day,

351
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:16,440
so hes sure
this is where theyll trick him.

352
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:20,316
And everyone makes sure he thinks
the cameras in the restaurant.

353
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,063
He sees the telly van outside,
he sees the camera behind a mirror,

354
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:27,651
and his mate starts pretending
to act all weird and that.

355
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:31,363
So this bloke, right,
thinks he can fool everyone,

356
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:35,660
and he pretends he hasnt noticed,
although he has.

357
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:39,210
But hes, like, really nervous,
wondering whats gonna happen.

358
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:44,047
But they havent planned anything,
they just film him shitting himself.

359
00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:47,709
Anyway, at one point...
Stop it for fuck sake!

360
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,260
- It wasnt me.
- Who was it, then?

361
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:54,055
You see this famous bloke,
sweating like a pig,

362
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:57,852
pretending hes cool,
and each time the waiter walks by

363
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,888
he gets ready for it.

364
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:03,972
Then another bloke comes over
and asks him for his autograph.

365
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:06,185
The famous bloke thinks this is it,

366
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:08,775
and he has a go
at this other bloke,

367
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:12,108
the autograph bloke,
who doesnt know whats going on,

368
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:16,618
and they start laying
into each other. It was ace!

369
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,450
The telly people
hadto pull them apart.

370
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:22,285
Afight and everything,
it was brill!

371
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:25,370
And then?

372
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:28,127
Well, that was it.

373
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:43,094
Who was the famous bloke?

374
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,552
I cant remember but hes famous.

375
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,354
I dont remember.

376
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:05,529
Somethings going on...
See you later.

377
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:38,482
What didthey want?

378
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:41,690
Revenge is a dish best served cold!

379
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:45,485
No, it was Abdels brother.
Theyve got a pump-action shotgun.

380
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,399
Party time...

381
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,326
Shall we go and see Abdel
in hospital?

382
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,578
Got something to show you first.

383
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:13,425
This is a serious
fucking piece of kit!

384
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,682
- Look at it.
- Beautiful!

385
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,474
- What you gonna do with it?
- Stop it!

386
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:29,607
Well, what?

387
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,568
- Well see if Abdel dies first.
- You gonna kill a pig?

388
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:35,651
Get some respect.

389
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,575
By topping a copper?

390
00:27:37,785 --> 00:27:40,621
I dont know,
but itll even the score a bit.

391
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:43,866
- I could have got you a gun.
-This is different.

392
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,791
You think youre on a mission?

393
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:49,784
What are you on about?
I found the gun, end of story!

394
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,839
- Will it do Abdel any good?
- Itll do us some good.

395
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,047
Smart arse!

396
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:00,261
You knobhead!
Youve got a serious problem, Vinz.

397
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,263
Ill do what I have to.

398
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,759
- I dont want any bother.
- Just stay away, then.

399
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,053
Anyway,

400
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,315
with that thing,
youre the top man round here!

401
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,773
Hey, Hubert, wait for me!

402
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:35,960
Shit!

403
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:44,715
What you doing, laying an egg?

404
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:47,803
All right, dont shit yourself!

405
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:06,191
<i>Calling Dr Pujol
to operating block 4...</i>

406
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,459
Sorry, lads, you cant go in.

407
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,378
Weve come to see Abdel.

408
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:27,331
I have my orders.

409
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:30,667
Were not causing trouble.
Just two minutes, then well go.

410
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:32,843
Hes a friend.

411
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
The doctors wont let you in.
Hes in a coma.

412
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,591
We told you, were friends!

413
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:41,224
I cant! Id get the sack.

414
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,601
Yeah, just do as youre told!

415
00:29:43,812 --> 00:29:46,682
Dont take that tone.
His family is here.

416
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:48,938
Lets show them some respect.

417
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,104
Are you sure youre keeping
the right people out?

418
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:55,528
- Dont stay here, please.
- Get your hands off me!

419
00:29:57,241 --> 00:29:59,316
You want me to move, do you?

420
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:01,526
You wanna shoot me?
Go on, then!

421
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:03,529
Whats going on?

422
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:06,363
That fucking twat!

423
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,782
We came to see someone we know...

424
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:11,033
Whats going on?

425
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,162
Were not goingtill we see Abdel.

426
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,380
Youd better clear off
before I arrest you.

427
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:18,383
Shut it!

428
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,016
Calm down.

429
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,806
Calm down!

430
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,850
These youngsters
started causingtrouble

431
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,189
and I hadto arrest the ringleader.

432
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:41,518
- He didnt do anything!
-The ringleader.

433
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:44,277
<i>- Saïd, the ringleader?
- Raas clat!</i>

434
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:55,742
All that trouble last night,
and youre still at it?

435
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,165
You had to try
to get in the hospital!

436
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:01,754
-They were only doingtheir job.
- Doingtheir job!

437
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,585
Shut your fucking mouth
once and for all!

438
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,255
- You shut yours!
- Watch how you talk to me!

439
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:11,216
- Watch how you talk to me!
- Just shut it, once and for all!

440
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:13,257
You know nothing!

441
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:16,308
- And what do you know?
- Shut up, you idiot!

442
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:18,759
- Dont you...
- Watch how you talk to me!

443
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:22,600
The bastards who beat up Abdel
will go down, believe me.

444
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:24,274
In your dreams!

445
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:28,442
The cops in there are simply
protectingAbdel and his family.

446
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:32,483
You have to come
and stir things up...

447
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,736
Fucking idiot!
Confusing the issue...

448
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:39,822
Those cops are protecting
Abdel and his family, thats all.

449
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:43,997
The majority of cops on the street
want to protect you, not hurt you.

450
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:47,911
Yeah! Who protects us from you?

451
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,816
Dont let me catch them again!

452
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:09,657
Did you learn that off the telly?

453
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:11,491
You watch your lip!

454
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:14,323
Watch you own lip, you wanker!

455
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,952
You make me look a fool
in front of my colleagues again,

456
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,624
and Ill let your brother
come and get you!

457
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,459
- I didnt ask for help.
- I did it for your brother.

458
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:29,129
I dont want him
cutting you in pieces.

459
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,053
<i>Cut you in pieces...</i>

460
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,302
I heard about the gym.
I could help you get a new grant.

461
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,219
Im sure you could get another.

462
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,480
Forget it. Hitting punching bags
isnt enough for them any more.

463
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,737
Afew years ago I could still
talk to them. Not any more.

464
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,482
<i>And they know me!</i>

465
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:57,983
But imagine an eager new cop.
He wouldnt last a month.

466
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,822
An Arab in a police station
doesnt last an hour!

467
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:05,165
Ive got to go.
Try and stay cool.

468
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,949
Yeah, well try!

469
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,033
You little twat!
Dont talk to me, right?

470
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:12,582
All right, all right...

471
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,082
You shook his hand?

472
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,376
Hes always been fair with me.

473
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:21,263
Hes Babylon!
You dont shake his hand.

474
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:24,591
Go and shoot him, then!
Ill go on shaking his hand.

475
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:25,839
Youre full of shit!

476
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:27,850
Dont you worry about me!

477
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:29,887
I knew it!

478
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:33,938
You were really weird
in the hospital. Show me...

479
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,431

00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:39,771
-And you didnt tell us!
- You didnt wanna hear about it.

481
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:41,897
I didnt think
you were that stupid.

482
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:45,069
Im a big boy now,

483
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,529

485
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:53,619
Tough guy with a shooter...

486
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,542
Stop it, Hubert!
Come on, lets get a sandwich.

487
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,954

00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:02,955
- Im off.

489
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,253
What you doing?

490
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,087
Come on, Hubert, stop it!

491
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,679
- Stop it for fuck sake!
- Let go of me!

492
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:19,184
Whats the matter with him?

493
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:23,931
The arsehole thinks too much.

494
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:41,824
- Wheres Mum?
- What does this mean?

495
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,833
I dont have time.

496
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,417
- Well?
- I dont have time.

497
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:57,340
- Whats the answer?
- I dont know.

498
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,556
Yeah, yeah, Im hopeless!
Hello, Mum.

499
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:04,560
- Hows little brother?
- Hes OK.

500
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,104
But your other brother inside
isnt doingtoo well.

501
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:12,348
- Whats up with Max now?
- He wrote, asking for schoolbooks.

502
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:13,813
Why?

503
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:18,156
I dont know. I think he wants
to get some qualifications.

504
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:23,320
He never even got
a school-leaving certificate!

505
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:26,825
Leave my pans alone!

506
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:28,612
I didnt do anything.

507
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,121
I dont know how Ill pay
for books.

508
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:32,835
Talking of which...

509
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:36,294
This is for the gas bill.

510
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:44,092
-And my machine?
- What machine?

511
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,969
What do you mean?
My new sewing machine.

512
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,680
Shit, I forgot to ask Dixons.

513
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:53,563
This ones
about to give up the ghost.

514
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:56,060
Patou,
do your homework in your room.

515
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:59,190
- Mum!
- No arguing.

516
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,441
Whos Dixons?
The fence in tower block B?

517
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,730
No, the one in D.

518
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:08,612
I dont know him.
Do you reckon he could get books?

519
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,569
Hes not an Ottakars!

520
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:14,700
<i>We have just learnt
that an officer lost his gun</i>

521
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,574
<i>in last night's fighting.
The gun still hasn"t been found.</i>

522
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:22,838
<i>We asked the estatesresidents
what implications thismight have</i>

523
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:25,336
<i>in such a tense situation.</i>

524
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:29,298
- What a bloody mess!
- They burnt down your gym.

525
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:34,592
Im sick of this estate, sick of it.
I have to get away.

526
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:38,935
Im sure Vinz was one of them
who burnt the gym.

527
00:37:40,103 --> 00:37:42,475
Hes getting out of control,
like Max.

528
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:48,062
Ive gotta get away from this place.

529
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:52,193
If you pass a shop on your way,
bring me a lettuce.

530
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:53,610
Come off it!

531
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:57,868
My nan shops here every day.
Its only two fucking francs!

532
00:37:58,077 --> 00:38:00,829
Your grandmothers one thing,
youre another.

533
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,947
<i>- Im just looking.
- You got 2 francs, Saïd?</i>

534
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:08,535
- One franc, will that do?
- No, one franc wont do.

535
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:13,549
Stop huffing and puffing
and just give me a franc.

536
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,961
Yeah, right...
What, what is it?

537
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,004
Well, what are you doing?

538
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,595
- I saw you.
- What did you see?

539
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:24,641
Ill have red ones, then.
Theyre cheaper.

540
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:28,719
My nanll kill me because
she doesnt like the red ones.

541
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:34,310
Why dont you shoot the Chink!
Get your nan the peppers she wants.

542
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:59,912
That is bad!
Wicked...

543
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,164
Too fucking wicked!

544
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,504
<i>- Saïd...
- Shut it!</i>

545
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:15,583
- Look, the cow!
- Shut up about that cow!

546
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:19,180
- I swear...
- Come and cut my hair.

547
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:23,138
-The same one as last night!
- Youre the fucking cow!

548
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,426
It was there, I saw it!
Dont you believe me? Right there!

549
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,271
Shut it!

550
00:42:32,943 --> 00:42:35,694
Canardo... Señor Canardo...

551
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:43,444
I fuck you all!
You, him, her...

552
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,910
Yes, Nan, theyre red.
Well soon know!

553
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:52,541
This business with the cow
is doing my head in.

554
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:56,085
Dont mess it up, Vinz...

555
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:58,918
I gotta get my end away.
Dont mess it up.

556
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:00,924
Hey, Im not Paul Bocuse...

557
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:04,211
- Bocuse?
- Plonk your arse down there!

558
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:08,383
This is wicked, Vinz.

559
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,763
Yeah, now stop moving.
I mean it, keep still!

560
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:16,479
- Careful or Ill shoot you.
- Keep still, I said!

561
00:43:17,315 --> 00:43:19,189
You really gonna waste a pig?

562
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,436
You wanna be the next Raghead
beaten to death in a cell?

563
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:24,817
Yeah, well, nor do I!

564
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,987
You dont wanna be
the next Raghead...

565
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,192
The others think its a big joke.
Well, Im not laughing.

566
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:37,029
- Careful...
- Its all right.

567
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:40,411
Theyve got their guns...
What you done?

568
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:42,703
Nothing, I swear!
Its fine.

569
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,459
Why do you have to swear, then?

570
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,129
- Because its fine.
- Whys it feel all cold?

571
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,714
Its cold in here, thats why.

572
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:52,884
Its cold in here?

573
00:43:53,138 --> 00:43:56,222
Look, Ill even it out

574
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,805
No, stop!
Show me, show me...

575
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,425
Thanks for trusting me!

578
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:08,730
- Trust you?
- Its just a patch...

579
00:44:09,027 --> 00:44:10,984
Its not even a patch, really.

580
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:14,231
Why dont you trust me?
Im not doing it any more!

581
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:20,696
<i>- Saïd, come back!

582
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:23,866
<i>Stop it, Saïd!
Youre a fucking pain!</i>

583
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:27,285
In New York,

584
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:30,585
- Just trust me.
- New York?

585
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,959
What, this is cool in New York?
I look like a punk!

586
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:39,298
<i>- Stop laughing!
- Come on, Saïd, give me a kiss!</i>

587
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:42,466
<i>- Keep away from me!
- Saïd, dont be a fucking pain!</i>

588
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,054
You really bear a grudge, dont you?

589
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:49,801
Hey, whos the dickhead
holding your lead?

590
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,314
Uttle sod!

591

00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:30,220
- Ill talk to Vincent how I like.
- Hes Vinz, not Vincent.

601
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:32,673
And you can stop talking to him!

602
00:45:32,892 --> 00:45:36,141
- Now piss off!

603
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,181
Ill tell Dad.

604
00:45:38,397 --> 00:45:39,891
Tell him! He doesnt care.

605
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,313
- Coming tonight?
- Where?

606
00:45:42,526 --> 00:45:45,395
Into Paris.
Jasons brothers got a fight.

607
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:48,066
- Got any tickets?
- Its free.

608
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,656
Cool.

609
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:56,866
The old ways are dying out!

610
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:58,490
Look at this!

611
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:04,714
Aruckus!

612
00:47:16,024 --> 00:47:18,597
Remember my brother, you fucker!

613
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:21,813

00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:29,076
Get out of there, you bastards!

616
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:32,702
Get out or Ill shoot!

617
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:38,744
Nobody move!

618
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:48,087
Nobody move!

619
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:50,669
- Grab him!

620
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,946
Stop! Stop!

621
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:17,568
Get out of here, you bastards!

622
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:31,542
Hey, Vinz, Hubert!

623
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,333

00:48:38,388 --> 00:48:39,715
Dont move!

626
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:44,721
What the fuck are you doing?

627
00:48:46,353 --> 00:48:47,977
Vinz, shit!

628
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:50,099
What did you do?

629
00:48:50,315 --> 00:48:52,307
Fuck your mothers!

630
00:48:58,113 --> 00:49:01,564
The pig was there,
right at the end of my gun.

631
00:49:01,783 --> 00:49:04,024
I had him, as clear as I see you.

632
00:49:04,243 --> 00:49:06,070
- Quiet!
- No, fuck it!

He shit himself, I swear.

634

If Hubert hadnt been there,
Id have shot the fucker!

635
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:16,787
Hubert twatted him. Straight up!
Lifted him off his feet!

636
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:19,127
- No!
- I swear on my mothers life.

637
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,416
He decked the pig?

638
00:49:21,717 --> 00:49:23,875
Hubert, you were brilliant!

639
00:49:33,227 --> 00:49:37,307
<i>The World is yours</i>

640
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,888
Now what do we do?

641
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,727
Dunno about you two.
Ive gotta get my money.

642
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,270
You got Asterixs address?

643
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,235
OK, but dont keep me hanging on...

644
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:40,361
15 francs for a Cacolac!

645
00:50:40,578 --> 00:50:43,282
Id better get my money tonight.

646
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:46,326
You want some, Vinz?
Want some Cacolac?

647
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:47,621
- You dont?
- No.

648
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:48,830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

649
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:50,324
Just a drop?

650
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:52,911
Brother Hub, you want some...

651
00:50:53,422 --> 00:50:55,829
Youre a Cacolac already!

652
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,840
Are you two gonna sulk
much longer?

653
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:08,135
What you talking about?
Im not sulking.

654
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:10,060
- I dont believe it!
- Tell him!

655
00:51:10,271 --> 00:51:11,848
Youre like two kids!

656
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:14,222
<i>- Whos a kid?
- I said twokids!</i>

657
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:16,480
Two kids arguing about shit!

658
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:19,230
Yeah, Im right with you there!

659
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:21,817
Killing a cop is serious shit!

660
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:23,572
<i>Hang on, Saïd...</i>

661
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:27,068
Tell your mate I never said
I was gonna kill a cop.

662
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:29,029
Yes, you did! You did!

663
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:30,989
No, thats not what I said.

664
00:51:31,206 --> 00:51:33,826
<i>I said if Abdel dies,
Ill kill one.</i>

665
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:36,448
Im not just gonna do it for fun.

666
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:39,669
In the cellar,
if I hadnt had the gun,

667
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,046
theyd have beaten us to death
like Malik Oussekine.

668
00:51:43,257 --> 00:51:44,917
Thats not the same thing!

669
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:48,716
Do you expect us to come
and visit you every Sunday?

670
00:51:49,096 --> 00:51:53,259
Im not asking anything off someone
whos all matey with the filth!

671
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:56,428
Yeah, thats right, laugh!

672
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:58,387
Yeah, laugh! What?

673
00:51:58,604 --> 00:52:01,641
Ive had my fill
of being fucked by the system!

674
00:52:01,857 --> 00:52:05,724
We live like rats in shitholes!
Do you do anything to change it?

675
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:08,020
You dont! Nor do you!

676
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:10,609
Well, Ill tell you something.

677
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:12,946
If Abdel dies, Ill even the score

678
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:15,068
andtake out a pig!

679
00:52:17,162 --> 00:52:20,613
Theyll understand were not
turningthe other cheek any more!

680
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:25,659
That speech sounded like a cross
between Moses and BernardTapie.

681
00:52:25,878 --> 00:52:29,413
Seriously, Vinz, forget it.
Youre way out of order.

682
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:32,632
<i>Saïd, if Abdel dies,
do we lose a mate or not?</i>

683
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:35,423
If he kills a cop,
that makes one less, right?

684
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:36,716
So its just him!

685
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:40,262
Its just you!
You cant put a hole in them all!

686
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:42,513
What is this, a morality lesson?

687
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,051
Youre so superior,
telling me whats right!

688
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,187
Why are you always on the side
of those fuckers?

689
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,473
Hang on!
Which fuckers do you mean?

690
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,396
If youd been to school
youd know that...

691
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:55,437
Hate begets hate!

692
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:58,489
Well, I didnt go to school!
Im from the street!

693
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:00,358
Know what the street taught me?

694
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:04,157
If you turn the other cheek,
you get fucked! Leave me alone!

695
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:06,245
What the fuck?

696
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:09,824
You pulled a cops gun on a cop!
You could have got us all killed!

697
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:13,078
You cant beat a good shit!

698
00:53:13,295 --> 00:53:17,422
You shouldnt ask yourself
whether you believe in God,

699
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:19,873
but whether God believes in us.

700
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:23,591
I had a friend, name of Grunwalski.

701
00:53:23,928 --> 00:53:27,179
We were both deportedto Siberia.

702
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:30,930
When you got sent
to the work camps in Siberia,

703
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:34,014
they packed you in cattle trucks,

704
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:38,226
which crossedthe frozen steppes
for days on end.

705
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:40,647
Not a person in sight.

706
00:53:40,902 --> 00:53:43,227
You huddled together for warmth.

707
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:48,190
But the problem was,
you couldnt have a shit

708
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,864
in the wagon.

709
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:53,995
Andthe only times we stopped

710
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:57,538
were to take on water
for the locomotive.

711
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:00,953
But Grunwalski was very prudish.

712
00:54:01,169 --> 00:54:03,412
Even when we hadto wash together,

713
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:05,293
he was embarrassed.

714
00:54:05,507 --> 00:54:09,006
I used to make fun of him
because of that.

715
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,261
So when the train stopped,
everyone got out

716
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:16,171
to go for a shit behindthe wagon.

717
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:19,842
Id been giving Grunwalski
such a hard time about it,

718
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:22,896
that he preferred
to go a bit further off.

719
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:26,190
So the train started again,

720
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,558
and everyone jumped back on,

721
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,233
because it didnt wait for you.

722
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:34,319
The problem was that Grunwalski,

723
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:37,402
whod gone further away,
behind a bush,

724
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:39,610
hadnt finished his shit.

725
00:54:40,078 --> 00:54:44,289
I saw him run out
from behindthe bush,

726
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:46,871
holding his trousers up,

727
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:49,042
so as not to fall.

728
00:54:49,337 --> 00:54:51,910
And he tried to catch the train.

729
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:54,254
I held out my hand,

730
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:57,301
but each time he reached out,

731
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:01,460
he let go of his trousers,
which fell round his ankles.

732
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,722
So hed pick his trousers up
and start running again.

733
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:09,350
But each time,
his trousers would fall down again

734
00:55:09,562 --> 00:55:11,888
when he reached for my hand.

735
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:15,644
- So what happened?
- Nothing.

736
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:20,648
Grunwalski froze to death.

737
00:55:22,574 --> 00:55:23,570
Goodbye.

738
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,533
What did he tell us that for?

739
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:43,425
Yeah, Ive got the address.
Ill call you back.

740
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,713
What did he tell us that for?

741
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,816
Ive just got out of hospital,

742
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:10,398
I havent eaten for two days,
I have a childto feed...

743
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:13,024
Minas not lookingtoo good.

744
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:14,483
Im serious.

745
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:17,908
Catch her with a lasso,
like a cowboy.

746
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,281
Grab a lasso, catch a cow!

747
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,663
What you want?
Me, too, my dads in prison,

748
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:26,369
my mums in prison,
my brother, my sister...

749
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:28,711
Get a job like everyone else!

750
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:31,925
What the fuck?
Is it carnival day today?

751
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:36,173
Fucking Mina!

752
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:40,012
- Mina...
- Ladies and gentleman,

753
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:43,309
Im homeless,
not entitledto benefit,

754
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,518
Ive just got out of prison,
and Id like...

755
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:50,394
Another hundred metres,
you cant miss it.

756
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:52,767
-Thanks.
- Have a good day, sir.

757
00:56:52,987 --> 00:56:54,101
Thanks.

758
00:56:58,575 --> 00:57:01,065
Fuck, the cops are polite here!

759
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,327
He called me sir and everything.

760
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:18,377
Maybe he won the lottery
and kept it quiet.

761
00:57:22,512 --> 00:57:24,920
Fuck, its closed!

762
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,555
Right, whats his real name?

763
00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:31,554
I dunno.
I just know him as Asterix.

764
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,181
Asterix...

765
00:57:35,774 --> 00:57:37,896
Oh, fuck it, well find out.

766
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:41,398
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, sorry to bother you,</i>

767
00:57:41,613 --> 00:57:44,648
is that Asterixs flat?

768
00:57:45,324 --> 00:57:48,028
Yeah, I know
it sounds a bit weird but...

769
00:57:49,744 --> 00:57:51,783
The bastard hung up!

770
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,282
- Go on, you try.
- Why me?

771
00:57:54,499 --> 00:57:56,491
Go on!

772
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,582
Me and Kunta Kinte cant do it.

773
00:58:01,338 --> 00:58:02,832
<i>- Hello.
- Yes, hello?</i>

774
00:58:03,048 --> 00:58:04,376
Is Asterix there?

775
00:58:04,591 --> 00:58:07,757
<i>Asterix? Why not Obelix too,
while you"re at it?</i>

776
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:11,551
- No, hang on...
- Stop it, Vinz!

777
00:58:11,764 --> 00:58:14,634
Youve gone and fucked it now!

778
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:15,929
Hey, cut it out!

779
00:58:16,185 --> 00:58:17,928
Sorry to bother you, madam.

780
00:58:18,145 --> 00:58:20,516
Were looking for a friend
called Asterix.

781
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,354
We dont know his family name.

782
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,980
What do you think youre doing,
ringing like that?

783
00:58:26,193 --> 00:58:28,019
I dont believe this!

784
00:58:28,945 --> 00:58:30,688
Its OK, well go.

785
00:58:31,697 --> 00:58:33,654
No, were not going.
Im staying.

786
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:36,280
Go on, then, call the police!

787
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:40,907
<i>Saïd?</i>

788
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:42,824
<i>-Asterix?
- Saïd?</i>

789
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,199
<i>- Yeah. What floor?
- The 5th.</i>

790
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,494
Let us in, then.

791
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:53,247
<i>Asterix, Asterixl
l never heard anything like itl</i>

792
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,011
- You werent followed?
- No.

793
00:59:09,231 --> 00:59:10,393
- No one?
- No.

794
00:59:10,607 --> 00:59:11,935
-Are you sure?
- Why?

795
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,395
Because...

796
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,317
- You all right?
-And you?

What is this place?
You win the lottery?

800
00:59:27,622 --> 00:59:31,369
This flat was lent to me
and Im never giving it back.

801
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:34,495
This isnt a flat, its a castle!

802
00:59:34,711 --> 00:59:35,991
I dont believe it!

803

01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:18,746
Come on, hand it over.

819

Come and get it.

820

OK, you asked for it!

821
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:30,968

<i>Piss off, Saïd!</i>

828
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:51,025
- Put it away, Vinz!
- Its OK.

829
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:55,357
Smith and Wesson 44 Magnum,
snub-nose, all chrome.

830
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:59,238
- Watch it, its loaded.

831
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:01,282
Nice weapon!

832
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,120
Youre a gangsta!

833
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,996
- Its for protection.
- You know David Blaine?

834
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,083
- What?
- Watch.

835
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,700
One bullet.

836
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:16,962
Bang! I missed!

837
01:01:17,259 --> 01:01:18,588
- Youre mental!
- I missed.

838
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:21,720
- Theyre real bullets!
- Hang on, this is a classic.

839
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,717
Its all right.
Even rarer...

840
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:27,423
The same trick with two bullets.

841
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:31,184
-Asterix, what you doing?
-Are you shitting it?

01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,409
What the fuck are you after?

01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:54,833
Go on, do it!
Are you chicken?

851
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:57,580

Yeah, Im pointing it at you!

854
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:05,589

Ill show you whos fucking chicken!

856
01:02:09,055 --> 01:02:12,922
Wanna see someone pointing a gun?
Wanna see a real shooter?

857
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:16,095
- What? What?
- Hey, Vinz, look!

858
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:20,474
Said!
Get him out. Go on, go on...

859
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:24,105
Its all right, were going.
Were going.

860
01:02:25,193 --> 01:02:27,186
Aline of coke, arsehole?

861
01:02:27,404 --> 01:02:29,776
Fuck you,

862
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,152
Look.

863
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:38,031
Thats right, dicksplash.
Thats right.

864
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:41,457
- He was bluffing.
- Yeah, it was brilliant!

865
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:44,157
At least Ive got my money now.

866
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:47,414
Play your kiddies games
without us from now on!

867
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,289
My kiddies games?

868
01:02:49,506 --> 01:02:51,832
Abrothers in hospital, remember!

869
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:54,588
- What the...
- Stop acting like such a martyr!

870
01:02:54,803 --> 01:02:56,795
Youre not built for it.

871
01:02:57,013 --> 01:03:00,796
And you are, are you?
The big tough black man!

872
01:03:01,016 --> 01:03:02,345
Fuck you!

873
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:04,262
Right, fuck me...

874
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:13,185
Keep calm, gentlemen.

875
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:14,980
- Who are you?
- Keep calm!

876
01:03:15,196 --> 01:03:18,150

01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:23,612

01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:25,406
Howd you get here so quick!

880
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:29,121
On my estate, you get knifed,
you have to make an appointment!

881
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:33,793
Hey, young man! Are you together?
Do you know him?

882
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:36,459
- I dont know them!

883
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:38,796

01:03:44,596 --> 01:03:47,882
Ill show you my papers.
Im a law-abiding citizen.

887
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:49,636
Come on!

888
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,474
Hey, not so rough!

889
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,181
Dont move! Dont move, I said!

890
01:03:59,485 --> 01:04:01,560
Stay right where you are, OK?

891
01:04:01,778 --> 01:04:03,687
- Do you know him?
- Who?

892
01:04:03,905 --> 01:04:06,193
- Your pal.
- I dont know him.

893
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,613
Are you takingthe piss or what?

894
01:04:08,826 --> 01:04:10,652
Dont know him...
Keep still!

895
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:12,992
-This isnt right!
- No, no...

896
01:04:13,246 --> 01:04:16,745
You should have thought of that.
Hey, whats this?

897
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:21,251
Good stuff, is it?
I think Ill keep this.

898
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:22,750
Gently!

899
01:04:23,005 --> 01:04:25,128
The best is Afghan.

900
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,792
Take-off and landing
are nice and sweet.

901
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:30,298
Black Bombay, the same.

902
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:33,003
Lebanese... depends what region.

903
01:04:33,222 --> 01:04:35,927
This is shit but Ill keep it.

904
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:37,256
Well?

905
01:04:37,643 --> 01:04:40,679
He ran me all roundthe houses.
Well take these two.

906
01:04:40,896 --> 01:04:42,804
- Get in the back.
- No...

907
01:04:43,022 --> 01:04:45,691
- Get in the back!
- Fuck!

908
01:04:54,699 --> 01:04:56,277
<i>Listen to me.</i>

909
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:59,825
<i>Asfar as l"m concerned,
you"re just shit on the road.</i>

910
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,953
<i>You know what happensto that?</i>

911
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,655
<i>You scrape it up with a shovel.</i>

912
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,867
<i>Or leave it to the wind and rain.</i>

913
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:09,161
<i>Or you tread right in it.</i>

914
01:05:09,587 --> 01:05:13,002
<i>So my advice is, choose the spot
where you get shit outl</i>

915
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:17,335
<i>So go on, make my...</i>

916
01:05:46,536 --> 01:05:50,320
<i>You miserable little beasts,
l shall catch youl</i>

917
01:05:50,957 --> 01:05:53,827
<i>The sorcerer's stupid donkey...</i>

918
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,176
Theres no one around.

919
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:14,597
None of your rioting mates
from the estate.

920
01:06:15,353 --> 01:06:18,270
Go on, pick it up with your feet.

921
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:21,643
Back home, you pick things up
with your feet.

922
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:24,861
You do that
in the old country, dont you?

923
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:28,154
Thats the really tough bit...

924
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:35,409
But were all right here.
Were in no hurry.

925
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,827
They might be out
in an hour or two.

926
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,948
We should make the most of it.

927
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:43,708
- Make the most of it.
-Abullet in the head.

928
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:47,709
No! Like this, you see?
Like this...

929
01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:51,377
And then you stop,
just in time, see?

930
01:06:51,593 --> 01:06:55,211
Its all about control.
Absolute control.

931
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:59,474
Control, you see? Control.
Thats good.

932
01:06:59,684 --> 01:07:01,925
Dont get upset, it wont last.

933
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:03,554
You bastard!

934
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,605
What about you?
What you got to say?

935
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,143
What you got to say?

936
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,560
Fucking leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

937
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,394
Leave him alone?
You know this one?

938
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:18,943
You know the Shanghai hold?
All the way from the East!

939
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,911
Hang on!
I think this ones thirsty.

940
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:26,363
- Here you go.
- You bastard!

941
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:30,579
Youre going to hurt yourself.
Calm down.

942
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:34,917
Dont sit like that,
Ill get excited!

943
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:37,254
You look like a birdfrom behind.

944
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:40,467
Theyre little girlies.
Cocksucking girlies.

945
01:07:40,678 --> 01:07:42,421
There, there...

946
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:46,172
Theyre nice little
cocksucking girlies.

947
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:49,603
Like that, you see.
Then you let up.

948
01:07:50,228 --> 01:07:52,683
The hardest bit
is knowing when to stop.

949
01:07:52,897 --> 01:07:55,648
You have to know
when to cool it.

950
01:07:56,484 --> 01:08:00,266
Hey? Hey?
Thats all there is to it.

951
01:08:00,528 --> 01:08:03,612
I like this one.
Hes got a nice face.

952
01:08:03,823 --> 01:08:06,360
Whats his name, this one?

953
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:08,153
Hey, youre a cutie.

954
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:11,203
Yeah, yeah, Im cute. Yeah.

955
01:08:11,413 --> 01:08:15,031
What? What?
Am I ignoring you?

956
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,574
- Hubert!
- Which one? Not this one.

957
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,287
He doesnt look like a Hubert.

958
01:08:19,503 --> 01:08:21,828
<i>No, hes French.
Hes Saïd.</i>

959
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:23,375
Anice name.

960
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,590
<i>Saïd. Is that French?
No shit?</i>

961
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:29,044
Its a nice name, a nice name.

962
01:08:29,429 --> 01:08:31,172
Look, look!

963
01:08:34,558 --> 01:08:38,769
The little ones more scared.
See, I told you he was.

964
01:08:38,978 --> 01:08:41,137
Let him go! Let him go!

965
01:08:41,356 --> 01:08:43,395
Calm them down. Thats it.

966
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:45,938
Youre not going to nick my beer?

967
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:49,568
You mustnt let it go too far.

968
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:53,113
Not that we wouldnt like to...
You cant have it all, eh?

969
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:56,071
Isnt that right, you scumbag?

970
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,990
All right, lets go.

971
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:26,760
Hey, mister!

972
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:29,435
- He wont let us out.
- Fucking bastard!

973
01:09:29,648 --> 01:09:32,317
Did anyone ask you?
Do I know you?

974
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,630
Hey, Vinz.

975
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:08,883
<i>Where are Saïd and Hubert?</i>

976
01:10:09,099 --> 01:10:11,424
Theyve been doing
my head in tonight.

977
01:10:11,643 --> 01:10:14,312
Youre always
at each others throats.

978
01:10:44,547 --> 01:10:45,875
Your sister do it, then?

979
01:10:46,674 --> 01:10:48,962
Just shut it!

980
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:51,335
Yeah, your sister does it!

981
01:10:51,553 --> 01:10:55,218
She doesnt fancy you
and youre not getting near her!

982
01:10:55,432 --> 01:10:57,507
Dont even look at her!

983
01:10:57,725 --> 01:11:00,928
Watch the turn!
Watch the turn!

984
01:11:01,145 --> 01:11:03,896
I wont touch her, shes pregnant!

985
01:11:04,105 --> 01:11:06,561
Shut it, you slag!

986
01:11:06,774 --> 01:11:07,889
Straight up!

987
01:11:09,611 --> 01:11:11,603
Watch how you talk
about my sisters!

988
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:35,340
What do you mean,
its not possible?

989
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:38,339
Same every time!

990
01:11:38,553 --> 01:11:41,837
That fucking nigga never lets us in!

991
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:44,843
Weve known his brother
for ten years

992
01:11:45,058 --> 01:11:49,222
and he still shafts us.
It winds me up!

993
01:11:50,396 --> 01:11:53,148
Hey, what you doing with that gun?

994
01:11:53,691 --> 01:11:57,688
What you doing?
Stop playing cowboys!

995
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:01,186
Stop it!

996
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:05,190
Told you Id come back, didnt I?
You fucking cunt!

997
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:08,153
Not so tough now, eh?

998
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:11,656
You and your shitty fucking club!

999
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,123
Fuck you,

1000
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,576
Fucking nigga!

Fucking hell!

1002
01:12:36,228 --> 01:12:37,805
They did it on purpose.

1003
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,682
Bastard pigs...

1004
01:12:54,452 --> 01:12:56,196
Whens the next one?

1005
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,163
Tomorrow morning.

1006
01:13:38,116 --> 01:13:40,688
How much did Asterix owe you?

1007
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:41,905
What?

1008
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:45,036
- How much did Asterix owe you?
- 500.

1009
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:47,488
- 500 grand?
- 500francs.

1010
01:13:47,707 --> 01:13:51,289
What? All this shit for 500 francs?

1011
01:13:51,502 --> 01:13:54,373
Its not the money,
its the principle, innit?

1012
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,631
The principle...

1013
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,797
Youre saying Wile E. Coyote,
not Road Runner,

1014
01:14:03,054 --> 01:14:05,509
andTom, not Jerry?

1015
01:14:05,723 --> 01:14:08,510
OK, then,
between Sylvester andTweetie Pie?

1016
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:10,678
Stuff Sylvester!

1017
01:14:10,894 --> 01:14:14,013
This is the bloke who sees cows
talking here!

1018
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:17,646
You know whos the baddest?
Gnasher, end of discussion!

1019
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:19,935
- Gnasher?
- End of discussion.

1020
01:14:20,152 --> 01:14:23,853
All right, theres no point
trying to argue with you.

1021
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:25,696
Look whos talking!

1022
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:28,232
Youve got it all arse-about.

1023
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:32,401
<i>What was the name of the strip?
Dennisthe Menace, not Gnasher!</i>

1024
01:14:32,622 --> 01:14:37,697
Gnasher would fuck you
and Wile E. Coyote any day!

1025
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:40,124
What you talking about?

1026
01:14:40,336 --> 01:14:42,708
Whod Gnasher fuck? Me?

1027
01:14:42,922 --> 01:14:44,665
Gnashers black!

1028
01:14:44,882 --> 01:14:48,002
Gnashers black?
Bollocks!

1029
01:14:48,802 --> 01:14:51,127
- Come on, what we got to lose?
- Come on.

1030
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:53,635
What we got to lose?

1031
01:15:01,146 --> 01:15:04,645
Its horrible!
Horrible, horrible...

1032
01:15:08,569 --> 01:15:09,649
Hubert.

1033
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:13,446
Is the bloke who did this famous?

1034
01:15:15,492 --> 01:15:18,113
He will be when hes grown-up.

1035
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:38,920
Look, theres champagne,
Martini, Brancardi...

1036
01:15:39,138 --> 01:15:40,881
- Not for me.
- No... Bacardi.

1037
01:15:41,098 --> 01:15:44,632
Out the way!
Theres some nuts left.

1038
01:15:45,769 --> 01:15:46,847
Look!

1039
01:15:48,605 --> 01:15:50,099
Thank you, Charles!

1040
01:15:50,648 --> 01:15:52,391
Hey, Charles, what about us?

1041

1043
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:00,561
<i>Hey, Saïd, let them past!</i>

1044
01:16:01,783 --> 01:16:05,483
Do you smell fish?
Thats what I call women!

1045
01:16:06,536 --> 01:16:08,446
Mines the black one!

1046
01:16:10,082 --> 01:16:13,166
- Hubert, do us a favour?
- No, not me.

1047
01:16:13,376 --> 01:16:15,997
Hubert, I bought you
a kebab last week.

1048
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:18,121
You said you owed me.

1049
01:16:18,381 --> 01:16:20,503
-The black, OK?
-All right.

1050
01:16:20,716 --> 01:16:23,384

1051
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:25,965
- What did I say?
- Shut up!

1052
01:16:26,179 --> 01:16:28,254
No, Hubert, just me!

1053
01:16:28,472 --> 01:16:31,389
- Hubert, the two of them!
- Just me! Shut it!

1054
01:16:34,186 --> 01:16:36,807
Hello, girls. Im Hubert.

My mate over there is a romantic.

01:16:40,108 --> 01:16:43,690
Hes a poet.
But hed love to talk to you.

1062
01:16:57,123 --> 01:16:58,866
<i>OK, Saïd, get over here.</i>

1063
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,035
Hold this.

1064
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:06,328
- Havent we met before?
- No. I wish we had, though.

1065
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:08,457
<i>- We could go somewhere...
- Hi, Im Saïd.</i>

1066
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,295
Dicksplash!

1067
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:13,380
Sorry, but youre leaning
on a painting.

1068
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:15,920
- Painting!
- Youre really fit.

1069
01:17:16,181 --> 01:17:18,304
- Fit for what?
- What do you think?

1070
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,391
I thought you were shy.

1071
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:23,934
Shy? Yeah, Im shy.
Im really shy.

1072
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:27,268
Whats your number?
We could go to the pictures.

1073
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:30,020
Yeah, right!
Youre all the same.

1074
01:17:30,235 --> 01:17:32,358
Your pal said you wanted to talk.

1075
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:36,188
You wanna talk?
What you wanna talk about, then?

1076
01:17:36,407 --> 01:17:38,980
Look, we dont mind talking to you,

1077
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:43,364
but you get all aggressive.
How do you expect us to respect you?

1078
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:47,079
Who do you think you are?
The bird on the Wonderbra advert?

1079
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,782
- I wasnt talking to you.
- Well, Im talkingto you!

1080

Hes mad!

1081

What are you looking at...?

1082

-Are you retarded or what?
- Youre the retarded one!

1083
01:17:59,845 --> 01:18:02,679
- Stop it!
- Leave it out!

1084
01:18:03,597 --> 01:18:06,135
- Weve done nothing to you!
- Gentlemen!

1085
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,923
- You come in here...
- Lets calm down.

1086
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:12,429
All right, granddad, nobodys dead!

1087
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:15,220
Is anybody dead? No!
So everythings OK.

1088
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,062
Theres no need to get aggressive.
Hey, son!

1089
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,815
- Were going, anyway.
- Im not your son!

1090
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,773
Please, please...

1091
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,065
Lets all calm down.

1092
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:28,283
- Hey, leave it out!
-Tell your pal to stop it.

1093
01:18:28,494 --> 01:18:31,447
Who you talkingto?
Fuck off!

1094
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:37,376
Hey, you know what?
You can all suck cocks in hell!

1095
01:18:37,586 --> 01:18:39,874
In hell! Fuck you!

1096
01:18:40,088 --> 01:18:43,172
- Bunch of wankers!

Have a nice fucking party!

1099
01:18:52,348 --> 01:18:53,593
Those big estates...

1100
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:55,889
We should have nicked a bottle.

1101
01:18:56,102 --> 01:18:58,771
I nicked a credit card
off the bloke at the bar.

1102
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:01,684
Slipping into your old ways!

1103
01:19:01,898 --> 01:19:04,223
Just like riding a bike.

1104
01:19:04,442 --> 01:19:06,684
Mr... Mr David Meaux!

1105
01:19:06,903 --> 01:19:08,611
Mr David Meaux!

1106
01:19:08,821 --> 01:19:10,695
Is he here? No!

1107
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,526
Well keep it, then.

1108
01:19:12,741 --> 01:19:14,650
Give it here, give it here.

1109
01:19:15,243 --> 01:19:18,114
What are you going on about?

1110
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:19,906
Wicked!

1111
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,996
What you on about?

1112
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:27,039
Your names David, is it?
I dont take credit cards.

1113
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:30,954
- You can make an exception.
-Are you taking the piss or what?

1114
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:38,506
- Have you farted?
- Whoever smelt it, dealt it.

1115
01:19:38,723 --> 01:19:41,178
What a stink!
It wasnt me, it was you.

Who farted?

1120
01:19:53,694 --> 01:19:55,353
- He did!

1121
01:19:56,696 --> 01:19:58,819

1122
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:01,901
It was him, all right?

1123
01:20:02,118 --> 01:20:04,276
Something crawled up your arse
and died!

1124

Fucking bastard steering wheel!
Fuck it!

1129
01:20:19,216 --> 01:20:22,799
No, hes the one who goes out
with that dirty half-cast...

1130

Are you going to bust
that fucking lock?

1132

Go on, use your feet!
Use your feet!

- Who can drive, then?
- Vinz.

1180

What do you mean, Vinz?
I didnt do my national service.

1181

He did. You did

The one with the Merc...

Thats not the same. It was...

1187

It was a Merc, a thingy...

1188

An automatic.
Not like this.

going on about in the bogs?

Talking about God and shitting...
What was all that about?

1218

- I can see some skinheads!

about the bloke
falling off a 50-storey skyscraper?

1229
01:26:17,112 --> 01:26:20,066
As he passes each floor,
he keeps sayingto himself,

1230
01:26:20,282 --> 01:26:24,742
So far, so good. So far, so good.

01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,020
This bloke comes out of a bar,

Whack! He smacks her in the teeth!

he looks at her and goes,

1329
01:35:21,297 --> 01:35:25,923
I thought you were tougher
than that, Batman! Brilliant!

1330
01:35:26,176 --> 01:35:27,967
Acloak like Batman!

Yeah, you were on the roof.

1336
