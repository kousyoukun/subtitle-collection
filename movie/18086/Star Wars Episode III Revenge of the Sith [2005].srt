[Man On Headset]
Copy, Red Leader.

00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,042
Mark my position. Form your squad up behind me.

We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,088
Set S-foils in attack position.

This is where the fun begins.

You won't get away this time, Dooku.

You did well, Anakin.

141
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,756
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

143
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,220
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

144
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:53,475
It is only natural.
He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.

349
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,681
And it was about you.

350
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,185
Tell me.

351
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,856
It was only a dream.

352

It was only a dream.

356

I won't let this one become real.

357
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,136
This baby will change our lives.

358
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,139
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me
to serve in the senate.

359
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,975
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

360
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,603
l— I know. I know.

361
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,398
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

362
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,444
We don't need his help.

363
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,782
Our baby is a blessing.

364
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:33,135

Yes.

372
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,330
Careful you must be
when sensing the future, Anakin.

373
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,751
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

374
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,257
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

375
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,552
Death is a natural part of life.

376

Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

377
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,726
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

378
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,938
Attachment leads to jealousy.

379
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,483
The shadow of greed that is.

380
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,403
What must I do, Master Yoda?

381
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,573
Train yourself to let go...

on the outer rim sieges.

I'm sorry. I was held up.

385
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,763
I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well.

386

Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

387

What's wrong, then?

388
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,107
The senate is expected...

389
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,694
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

390
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,157
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

391
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,701
It'll make it easier for us to end this war.

He has requested your presence.
What for?

395
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,758
He would not say.
He didn't inform the council?

396
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,345
That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual.

397
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,889
And it's making me feel uneasy.

398

00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,033
Of course.

405
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,723
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

406
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,102
Me? A master?

407
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,605
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

408
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,610
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

409
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,197
I think they will. They need you.

410

More than you know.

411
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,215
[Yoda] Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

412

Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

413
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,513
I understand.

414
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:09,685
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

415
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,812
What?

416
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,279
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

417
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,531
It's unfair.

418
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,161
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

419
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,789
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

420

Forgive me, Master.

421
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,134
[Ki-Adi-Mundi]
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic,

422
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,971
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

423
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,849
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

We do not have many ships to spare.

What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

427
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,486
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

428
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,031
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

429
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,451
Go I will.

430
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,579
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

431
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:15,000
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

432
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,419
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

433
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,588
May the Force be with us all.

434

What kind of nonsense is this?

435

Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

436
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,807
It's never been done
in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.

437

Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

438

To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

439

The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

440
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,279
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

441

I swear to you, I didn't ask
to be put on the council.
But it's what you wanted.

Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

That has nothing to do with this.

444
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,627
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

445
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,672
is because the chancellor trusts you.

446
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,800
And?
Anakin, I am on your side.

447
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,262
I didn't want to put you
in this situation.
What situation?

448

The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor's dealings.

449
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,148
They want to know what he's up to.

450
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,488
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

451
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,283
But that's treason.
We are at war, Anakin.

452
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,246
Why didn't the council give me this assignment
when we were in session?

453
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,790
This assignment is not to be on record.

we were serving no longer exists,

I'm not sure I understand.

517
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,573
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

518
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,076
The Jedi Council want control of the Republic.

519
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,913
They're planning to betray me.

520
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,458
I don't think that-
Anakin.

521
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,586
Search your feelings.

522
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,340
You know, don't you?

523
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,848
I know they don't trust you.
Hmm. Or the senate.

524
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:49,770
Or the Republic, or democracy, for that matter.

525
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:54,900
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

526
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,985
Why?

527
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,572
They asked you to do something...

528
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,949
that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

529
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,830
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

530
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,879
I don't, uh-

531
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,881
I don't know what to say.

532
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,551
Remember back to your early teachings.

533
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,931
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

534
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:30,727
Even the Jedi.
The Jedi use their power for good.

535
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,979
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

536
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:38,276
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way,

537
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,073
including their quest for greater power.

538
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,619
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

539
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,497
They think inwards— only about themselves.

540
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,917
And the Jedi don't?

541
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,588
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

542
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,299
[Applause]

543
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,770
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

544
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,443
No.
I thought not.

545
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,946
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

546
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,741
It's a Sith legend.

547
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,743
Darth Plagueis...

548
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:34,499
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise,

549
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:39,462
he could use the Force
to influence the midi-chlorians...

550
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,757
to create... life.

551
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,470
He had such a knowledge of the dark side,

552
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,601
he could even keep the ones he cared about...

553
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,603
from dying.

554
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,736
He could actually... save people from death?

555
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,116
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway to many abilities...

556
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:12,454
some consider to be unnatural.

557
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,415
Wh— What happened to him?

558
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,585
He became so powerful,

559
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,839
the only thing he was afraid of was...

560
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,841
Iosing his power.

561
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:28,386
Which eventually, of course, he did.

562
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:34,351
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

563
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,146
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

564
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,192
It's ironic.

565
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,319
He could save others from death,

566
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,530
but not himself.

567
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,246
Is it possible to learn this power?

568
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,210
Not from a Jedi.

569
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,979
[Man]
All Red units, over here!

570
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,868
[Ki-Adi-Mundi]
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

571
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,997
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

572
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,250
from the chairman of Utapau.
Hmm.

573
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,086
Act on this we must.

574
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,924
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

575
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,886
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

576
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:57,017
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

577
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,437
[Windu] The council will make up
its own mind who is to go,

578
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,522
not the chancellor.

579
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:07,569
A master is needed, with more experience.

580
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:12,157
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

581
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,617
[Yoda]
I agree.
[Ki-Adi-Mundi] Aye.

582
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,578
[Windu]
Aye.

583
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,457
[Windu]
Very well. Council adjourned.
[Grunts]

584
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,544
[Wookiees Growling, Grunting]

585
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,215
[Grunts]
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

586
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:34,846
Then now the time is, Commander.
Yes, sir.

[All Roaring]

588

Head for cover!

- [Tarzan Yell]
- [Roars]

591
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,312
You're gonna need me
on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree.

592
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,566
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.
Master.

593
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,824
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative ofyour training.

594
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:40,328
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

595
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,789
I've just been so frustrated with the council.

596
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,838
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud ofyou.

597
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,549
I have trained you since you were a small boy.

598
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,759
I have taught you everything I know.

599
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,596
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

600
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,391
But be patient, Anakin.

601
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,478
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

602
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,114
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

603
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,117
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

604
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:46,227
[Man] Fortunately, most of the cities
are concentrated on this small continent here.

605
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,398
On the far side.
I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

606
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,943
Just don't take too long.
Come on. When have I
ever let you down?

607
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,945
[Chuckles]
Very well.

608
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,533
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

609
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,061
Save your energy.

610
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,188
[Sighs]
I can't.

611
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,065
Don't give up, Padmé.

613
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,997
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

614
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,166
He came by this morning.

615
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,461
What did he want?

616
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,505
He's worried about you.

617
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:01,928
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.
[Sighs]

618
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,806
I feel lost.

619
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,102
Lost? What do you mean?

620
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,356
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

621
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,901
They trust you with their lives.

622
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,697
Something's happening.

623
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,449
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

624
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,745
I want more.

625
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,873
And I know I shouldn't.

626
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961
You expect too much ofyourself.

627
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,135
I found a way to save you.
Save me?

628
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,178
From my nightmares.

629
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,222
Is that what's bothering you?

630
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,892
I won't lose you, Padmé.

631
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,061
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

637
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,574
Unfortunately, the war.

638
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:51,245
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

639

With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...
