1
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,840
很久很久以前，在一个遥远的银河中...

2
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:42,680
星 球
大 战

3
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:51,350
西斯的复仇

4
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:51,350
第三章

5
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,310
战争！共和国在无情的西斯尊王和杜库伯爵的攻击下逐渐粉碎

6
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,310
两边都有强大的英雄  然而到处都充斥着邪恶

7
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,310
在迅猛的攻势下  邪恶的帝国军首领格里弗斯将军

8
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,310
攻入了共和国首都...

9
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:17,310
绑架了银河议会的领导帕尔帕廷议长

10
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,050
正当分裂主义者帝国军

11
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,680
尝试挟持他们手中宝贵的人质

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,310
从被包围的首都里逃脱时

13
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:31,310
两名绝地武士拼死展开了拯救议长的任务...

14
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,940
锁定他  R2
Lock on to him, R2.

15
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,480
师傅  格里弗斯将军的旗舰就在正前方
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead...

16
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,820
与秃鹫机器人一起缓慢前进的那艘
the one crawling with vulture droids.

17
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,440
噢  我看到了  这下好办多了
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

18
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,660
- “老怪”  收到吗? - 收到  红色领队
- "Oddball", do you copy? - Copy, Red Leader.

19
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,040
标记我的位置  带你的中队跟在我后上方
Mark my position. Form your squad up behind me.

20
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,050
我们在您后面了  克诺比将军
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

21
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,080
展开S翼  进入攻击位置
Set S-foils in attack position.

22
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,020
好戏要开始了
This is where the fun begins.

23
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,140
让他们从我们中间穿过
Let them pass between us.

24
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,040
我被盯上了
They're all over me.

25
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,170
- 快帮我...    - 我过去支援他们
- Get them off my... - I'm gonna go help them out.

26
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,670
不要  他们干他们的任务  我们干我们的
No. They are doing their job so we can do ours.

27
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,560
导弹  爬升
Missiles. Pull up.

28
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,200
- 没打中我们 - 又绕回来了
- They overshot us. - They're coming around.

29
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,030
没事的  R4 不要这样  别玩高难度动作
All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

30
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,380
释放所有能量  R2  准备倒转推进器
Surge all power units, R2. Stand by reverse thrusters.

31
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,230
搞定了  R2
We got 'em, R2.

32
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,730
飞行真不是人干的
Flying is for droids.

33
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,500
- 我被击中了  阿纳金?  - 看到了
- I'm hit. Anakin?   - I see them.

34
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,740
是蜂鸣机器人
Buzz droids.

35
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,390
R4  小心  你那边有一个...
R4, be careful. You have a...

36
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,430
噢  天啊
Oh, dear.

37
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
他们正试图关闭所有控制开关
They're shutting down all the controls.

38
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,650
往右边移一点  我帮你打掉他们
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.

39
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,930
记得你的任务 去指挥船里
The mission. Get to the command ship.

40
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,480
去营救议长  我这里已经没救了
Get the chancellor. I'm running out of tricks here.

41
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,660
噢  上帝啊...
In the name of...

42
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,950
- 别开火了!  这么做没用的   - 我也同意  真不是个好主意
- Hold your fire! You're not helping. - I agree. Bad idea.

43
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,140
我什么都看不到了  座舱里都是烟
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

44
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,310
我被他们包围了  阿纳金!
They're all over me. Anakin!

45
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,020
- 靠右一点 - 等等  这样我们俩都会没命的
- Move to the right. - Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

46
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,480
快离开这里  你在这里也没有用
Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.

47
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,770
师傅  我不会离开你的
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

48
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,620
搞定他  R2
Get him, R2.

49
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,050
当心
Watch out.

50
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
R2  射它中间的眼睛
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.

51
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,520
- 太好了  你搞定它了！ - 干得好  R2
- Yeah, you got him! - Great, R2.

52
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,730
格里弗斯将军的旗船就在前面了
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

53
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,900
你没注意到保护罩还开着吗？
Have you noticed the shields are still up?

54
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,410
不好意思  师傅
Sorry, Master.

55
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,660
我有种不祥的预感
I have a bad feeling about this.

56
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,390
在那儿  抓住他们
There they are. Get them.

57
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,200
R2  找出议长在哪里
R2, locate the chancellor.

58
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,250
议长的信号好象是从那里发出来的
The chancellor's signal is coming from right there...

59
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,420
尖顶上那个观察平台
the observation platform at the top of that spire.

60
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,460
我感觉到杜库伯爵了
I sense Count Dooku.

61
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,210
- 我感觉到了圈套 - 下一步?
- I sense a trap. - Next move?

62
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,880
跳出这个圈套
Spring the trap.

63
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,810
R2  回去  我要你呆在船上
R2, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

64
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,810
拿着这个  等我们的命令
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

65
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,610
舰长  现在情况怎么样
What's the situation, Captain?

66
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,660
两个绝地武士在机库着陆了  我们正在跟踪他们
Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. We're tracking them.

67
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,080
真让杜库伯爵说对了
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

68
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,290
毁灭者
Destroyers.

69
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,360
放下武器  我叫你们放下武器
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

70
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,360
- 明白 - 明白  明白
- Roger. - Roger, roger.

71
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,820
那些就是绝地武士的战机吧
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

72
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,410
- 你按停了? - 没有啊  你呢?
- Did you press the stop button? - No. Did you?

73
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,830
还有别的路可以出去
There's more than one way out of here.

74
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,800
我们不是要出去 让电梯动起来
We don't want to get out. We want to get moving.

75
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,760
R2  激活31174号电梯
R2, activate elevator 31174.

76
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
- 听到么  R2 - 什么声音?
- Come in, R2. - What that?

77
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,810
R2  收到没?
R2, do you copy?

78
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,350
R2  激活电梯31174
R2, activate the elevator number 31174.

79
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,190
回去干活吧  没事
Get back to work. That nothin'.

80
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,240
激活31174号电梯
Activate the elevator 31174.

81
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,820
R2  我们...
R2...

82
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,950
总是那么冲动
Always on the move.

83
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,040
R2  接通连线 R2  能听到么?
R2, switch on the comlink. R2, can you hear me?

84
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,750
R2?
R2?

85
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,710
R2！  R2！
R2! R2!

86
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,060
停下  我们要往上走
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

87
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,390
绝地武士  举起手来
Hands up,Jedi.

88
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,680
R2  你收到没有?
R2, do you copy?

89
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,760
R2  听到没有  我们要上  不是下
R2, do you hear me? R2, we need to be going up, not down.

90
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,900
嘿  你！
Hey, you!

91
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,740
对  这样子就对了
That's better.

92
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,410
你这个愚蠢的机器人
You stupid little astro droid.

93
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,220
噢  是你啊
Oh, it's you.

94
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,140
我的眼睛！  我的眼睛！
My eyes! My eyes!

95
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,600
- 刚刚怎么回事啊? - R2他...
- What was that all about? - R2 has been...

96
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,720
- 不是他的错 - 我说什么了吗?
- No loose wire jokes. - Did I say anything?

97
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,770
- 他已经在努力了   - 噢  我可什么都没说
- He's trying. - I didn't say anything.

98
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,320
- 议长 - 你还好吗?
- Chancellor. - Are you all right?

99
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,900
杜库伯爵
Count Dooku.

100
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,490
- 这次我们一起上 - 我正想这么说
- This time we will do it together. - I was about to say that.

101
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,670
找支援吧  你们不是他的对手  他是西斯尊主
Get help. You're no match for him. He's a Sith lord.

102
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,840
帕尔帕廷议长  我们最擅长就是对付西斯尊主
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our speciality.

103
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,810
亮出你们的剑吧
Your swords, please.

104
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,380
在议长面前我们可不想打得太难看
We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor.

105
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,730
你这次别想逃了  杜库
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

106
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,650
我也等了很久了
I've been looking forward to this.

107
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,950
伯爵  我的力量比上次见面提升了一倍
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

108
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,530
很好  信心翻倍  失败也翻倍
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

109
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,600
好
Get...

110
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,930
我感觉得到你的恐惧  天行者
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

111
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,010
你憎恨  你愤怒
You have hate. You have anger.

112
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,720
但是你没有好好利用它们
But you don't use them.

113
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,780
干得好  阿纳金
Good, Anakin. Good.

114
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
杀了他
Kill him.

115
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,300
现在就杀了他
Kill him now.

116
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,850
我不可以
I shouldn't.

117
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,810
动手
Do it.

118
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,780
你干得太棒了  阿纳金
You did well, Anakin.

119
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,070
把他留在世上太危险了
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

120
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,290
是的  但是他已经是阶下囚了
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

121
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,290
我不该那么做的  绝地武士不该那样
I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way.

122
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,510
这很平常的  他斩了你的手臂  你杀了他报仇
It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.

123
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,760
这不是第一次了  阿纳金
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

124
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,510
还记得你告诉我关于你母亲和沙地人的事吗
Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People?

125
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,890
在更多保安机器人来之前  我们得走了
Now we must leave before more security droids arrive.

126
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,270
阿纳金  没有时间了
Anakin, there's no time.

127
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,730
我们要马上离开这艘船
We must get off this ship before it's too late.

128
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,740
- 他只是晕过去了 - 别管他了  不然我们就赶不及了
- He seems to be all right. - Leave him, or we'll never make it.

129
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,910
我不会丢下他不管的
His fate will be the same as ours.

130
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
准备舷侧炮击！
Prepare for attack!

131
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,380
全力开火！  开火！
All batteries, fire! Fire!

132
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,350
电梯失灵了
Elevator's not working.

133
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,730
R2  激活3224号电梯
R2, activate elevator 3224.

134
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,720
- 倒转稳定器   - 倒转稳定器
- Reverse stabilizers. - Reversing stabilizers.

135
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,110
开动磁场！  开动磁场！
Magnetize! Magnetize!

136
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,990
启动紧急助推引擎
Fire the emergency booster engines.

137
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,920
水平恢复中  长官
We're levelling out, sir.

138
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,850
放松  我们只是有点小麻烦
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

139
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,560
- 发生什么了? - 抓住
- Did I miss something? - Hold on.

140
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,860
- 那是什么? - 噢老天
- What is that? - Oops.

141
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,950
R2  R2  把电梯停下来
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

142
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
太晚了  跳！
Too late. Jump!

143
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,250
看看机库里还有没有可以飞的东西
Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

144
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,470
R2  下来
R2, get down here.

145
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,850
R2  收到没?
R2, do you copy?

146
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,560
将军  找到绝地武士了 他们在328号走廊
General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.

147
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,020
启动射线罩
Activate ray shields.

148
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,270
射线罩
Ray shields.

149
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,280
等等  怎么会这样? 不该发生这种事情的
Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.

150
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
显然不是
Apparently not.

151
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,920
- 我说耐心些 - 耐心?
- I say patience. - Patience?

152
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,290
是的  R2很快就会过来
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

153
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,130
然后解除射线罩的
and then he'll release the ray shields.

154
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,550
看吧  没问题的
See? No problem.

155
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,470
别动
Don't move.

156
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,730
你还有后备方案吗?
Do you have a plan B?

157
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,740
来了
Ah, yes.

158
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,950
谈判代表
The negotiator.

159
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,290
克诺比将军  我们等了你很久了
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

160
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,580
抱歉
Excuse me.

161
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,410
- 这真不像是拯救行动 - 不客气
- That wasn't much of a rescue. - You're welcome.

162
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,680
还有...
And...

163
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,840
阿纳金.天行者
Anakin Skywalker.

164
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,680
名头那么响  没想到你这么年轻
I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little... older.

165
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,100
格里弗斯将军  我也以为你会高一点的
General Grievous. You're shorter than I expected.

166
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,020
绝地垃圾
Jedi scum.

167
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,610
我们还有事要做  阿纳金  别惹他
We have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.

168
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,040
你们的激光剑会成为我的又一件收藏品
Your lightsabres will make a fine addition to my collection.

169
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,840
这可不行  而且这次你也别想逃
Not this time. And this time, you won't escape.

170
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,960
R2
R2.

171
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,350
干掉他们！
Crush them!

172
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,810
尝尝我们的厉害！
Make them suffer!

173
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,520
来吧，现在！
Come. Now!

174
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,810
坚守你们的岗位！
Stay at your stations!

175
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,370
干掉他！ 干掉他！
Get him! Get him!

176
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,220
快跑！
Run!

177
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,690
别理他们
Don't bother with them.

178
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,100
- 保持行驶轨道 - 遵命
- Keep the ship in orbit. - Yes, sir.

179
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,040
你输了  克诺比将军
You lose, General Kenobi.

180
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,940
快离开这里！  快跑！
Get out of here! Run!

181
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,580
是时候弃船了
Time to abandon ship.

182
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,210
所有救生船都发射走了
All the escape pods have been launched.

183
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,380
是格里弗斯干的  你开得了这种巡洋舰嘛?
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

184
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,220
- 你是指我能不能把这堆废铁弄到地面上去吧? - 嗯?
- You mean, can I land what's left of it? - Well?

185
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,200
这种情况下
Under the circumstances,

186
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,180
飞行技术跟能不能降落都没有关系了
I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

187
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,470
系好安全带
Strap yourselves in.

188
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,110
打开所有舱盖  辅翼  张开缓冲片甲
Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and drag fins.

189
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,000
我们好象掉了什么
We lost something.

190
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,580
别担心  我们还有半条船
Not to worry. We are still flying half a ship.

191
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,840
我想我们开太快了
Now we're really picking up speed.

192
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,310
8加60
Eight plus 60.

193
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,720
- 我们进入大气层了 - 抓着那个  保持水平
- We're in the atmosphere. - Grab that. Keep us level.

194
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,280
稳住
Steady.

195
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,460
放轻松  R2
Easy, R2.

196
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,300
5000
5000.

197
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,340
救火船在左右就位
Fire ships on the left and the right.

198
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,180
- 我们领你们降落 - 收到
- We'll take you in. - Copy that.

199
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,350
- 跑道就在前面了 - 我们的机身太热了
- Landing strip, straight ahead. - We're coming in too hot.

200
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,800
又一次愉快的着陆
Another happy landing.

201
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,080
你不来吗  师傅?
Coming, Master?

202
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,880
不  我不太想看到那些政客
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.

203
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,630
我要到委员会去汇报这次的行动
I have to report to the council.

204
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,170
而且  有人更适合做英雄
Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

205
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,140
等等  整个行动都是你策划的
Hold on. This whole operation was your idea.

206
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,390
别忘了是你把我从蜂式机器人中救出来的  阿纳金
Let us not forget, Anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

207
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,890
是你杀了杜库  救了议长
And you killed Count Dooku, and you rescued the chancellor...

208
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,930
然后把晕倒的我背出来的
carrying me unconscious on your back.

209
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,520
都是你教我的  师傅
All because of your training.

210
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,150
阿纳金  公平一点  今天  你就是英雄
Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero...

211
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,650
你应当得到政客们的嘉勉
and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.

212
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,490
好吧  不过除了这第10次救你之外  你还欠我一份情
All right. But you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 1Oth time.

213
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,900
是第9次
Ninth time.

214
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,840
凯特坑道那次不算 例会上见
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.

215
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,710
帕尔帕廷议长  你还好吗?
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

216
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,720
是的  多亏了两位绝地武士
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

217
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,510
他们杀了杜库伯爵  但是又被格里弗斯将军逃脱了
They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.

218
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,150
格里弗斯向来就只会干这种事  他是个懦夫
General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does. He's a coward.

219
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,570
杜库死后  他就是帝国军的头领了
But with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army.

220
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,570
我可以保证地说...
And I assure you...

221
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,000
议会都会继续支持这场战役
the senate will vote to continue the war

222
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
只要格里弗斯一天不死
as long as Grievous is alive.

223
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,580
那么绝地委员会也将把寻找格里弗斯作为首要任务
Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

224
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,960
- 当心 - 抱歉
- Watch it. - Excuse me.

225
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,040
- 过来  R2 - 共和国真是多亏你了
- Come along, R2. - The Republic cannot praise you enough.

226
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,300
谢谢夸奖  奥加纳议员
Thank you, Senator Organa.

227
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,960
等等  情况不可能有那么差吧
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

228
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,590
对  我也同意这一点
Now there I agree with you.

229
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,430
事实上  我调校一下也可以做到你那样的
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

230
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,770
不过在格里弗斯没死之前  战争还得继续
But the fighting will continue until General Grievous is spare parts.

231
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,310
我会尽我所能跟议会进行协调的
I will do everything I can in the senate.

232
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,140
- 失陪一下 - 好的
- Excuse me. - Certainly.

233
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,740
阿纳金！
Anakin!

234
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,960
帕德梅  我想你
I've missed you, Padme.

235
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,380
外面有谣言说你死了
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

236
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,380
我不是好好的么
I'm all right.

237
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,130
我觉得我们好象分开了好久好久
It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.

238
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,050
要不是议长被绑架  可能还回不来呢
And it might have been, if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

239
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,520
在外围星系打仗的话根本回不来
I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.

240
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,270
- 等等  别在这里 - 就在这里
- Wait. Not here. - Yes, here.

241
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,600
对这些伪装我厌倦了
I'm tired of all this deception.

242
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,850
我不管他们知不知道我们已经结婚了
I don't care if they know we're married.

243
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,230
阿纳金  别说这种话
Anakin, don't say things like that.

244
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,660
你还好吗?你在发抖
Are you all right? You're trembling.

245
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,920
怎么了?
What's going on?

246
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,160
有一个好消息要告诉你
Something wonderful has happened.

247
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,430
亲爱的  我怀孕了
Ani, I'm pregnant.

248
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,900
那真是太好了
That's wonderful.

249
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,780
那我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

250
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,660
我们现在什么都别担心  好吗?
We're not gonna worry about anything right now. All right?

251
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,250
现在应该是最快乐的
This is a happy moment.

252
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,540
我人生中最快乐的时刻
The happiest moment of my life.

253
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,530
尊贵的西迪厄斯主人
Yes, Lord Sidious?

254
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,530
格里弗斯将军
General Grievous...

255
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,740
你先把分裂分子们带到木法星
I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

256
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,910
好的  陛下
It will be done, my lord.

257
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,080
将军  战争很快就要结束了
The end of the war is near, General.

258
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,800
但是杜库伯爵的不幸...
But the loss of Count Dooku...

259
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,060
他的死是必要的损失
His death was a necessary loss.

260
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,470
很快我就会有一个新的徒弟...
Soon I will have a new apprentice...

261
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,850
他将会更年轻  更强大
one far younger and more powerful.

262
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,890
亲爱的  我想把我们的孩子带回纳布星去
Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo.

263
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,350
我们可以到湖边隐居
We can go to the lake country where no one will know...

264
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,350
那里很安全的
where we can be safe.

265
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,900
我可以先过去  布置好婴儿房
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

266
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,910
我知道在哪里建最好  就在花园旁边
I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens.

267
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,780
你真的... 很美
You are so... beautiful.

268
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,460
那是因为我很爱你
It's only because I'm so in love.

269
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,520
不
No.

270
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,210
不  是因为我很爱你
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

271
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,260
你的意思是情人眼里出西施?
So love has blinded you?

272
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,760
不  我不是这个意思
That's not exactly what I meant.

273
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,390
但也许是这样的
But it's probably true.

274
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,110
阿纳金  救我！
Anakin, help me!

275
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,680
你怎么了?
What's bothering you?

276
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,100
没事
Nothing.

277
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,400
我还记得我是什么时候送这个给你的
I remember when I gave this to you.

278
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,690
要多久我们才可以真正坦诚相对?
How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?

279
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,740
- 我做了个梦 - 恶梦?
- It was a dream. - Bad?

280
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,950
就像那些我母亲死前我做过的梦一样
Like the ones I used to have about my mother, just before she died.

281
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,370
这次呢?
And?

282
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,750
这次换成了你
And it was about you.

283
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
告诉我
Tell me.

284
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,930
只是个梦而已
It was only a dream.

285
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,820
你因为难产而死
You die in childbirth.

286
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,740
孩子呢?
And the baby?

287
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,160
我不知道
I don't know.

288
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,870
- 只是个梦而已    - 我不会让这一切成真的
- It was only a dream. - I won't let this one become real.

289
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,630
孩子会改变我们的一生
This baby will change our lives.

290
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,550
女王大概不会允许我呆在议会里了
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate.

291
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,050
而委员会如果发现你做了父亲的话  你就会被开除的...
If the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled...

292
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,090
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

293
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,480
你说欧比旺可以帮我们吗?
Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

294
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
我们不需要他的帮助
We don't need his help.

295
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,860
孩子是对我们的恩赐
Our baby is a blessing.

296
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,550
前兆?
Premonitions?

297
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,130
前兆
Premonitions.

298
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,470
你见到的这些
These visions you have...

299
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,180
是痛苦的  苦难
They're of pain, suffering.

300
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,020
死亡
Death.

301
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,520
是你自己  还是别人?
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

302
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,030
别人
Someone.

303
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,030
亲密的人?
Close to you?

304
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,700
是的
Yes.

305
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,410
当你感知未来的时候  要小心  阿纳金
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin.

306
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,830
对失去的恐惧将带你走进黑暗
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

307
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,580
我不可以让这些发生的  尤达大师
I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.

308
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,630
死亡是生命中自然的一部分
Death is a natural part of life.

309
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,420
当你身边的人转化为原力时  你应该感到欣喜
Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.

310
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,810
不要忧伤  不要想念
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

311
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,020
依恋将导致嫉妒
Attachment leads to jealousy.

312
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,560
那就是贪婪的影子
The shadow of greed that is.

313
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,900
尤达大师  我该怎么做?
What must I do, Master Yoda?

314
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,650
训练你自己去放开
Train yourself to let go...

315
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,200
那些你害怕失去的东西
of everything you fear to lose.

316
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,460
你没听到外环战况的报告
You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.

317
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,170
不好意思  我有点事耽搁了
I'm sorry. I was held up.

318
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,170
- 是我的错 - 总言而之  战事非常顺利
- I have no excuse. - In short, they are going very well.

319
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,470
贸易联盟的势力大不如前  沃斯大师把他的军队移到了博兹佩提
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

320
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,480
有什么问题?
What's wrong, then?

321
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,780
今天议会要进行投票以决定是否给议长更多的权力
The senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.

322
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,230
哦  那就说明以后要少说话  多做事了  不好吗?
That can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad?

323
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,780
那样我们结束战争就更容易了
It'll make it easier for us to end this war.

324
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,830
提防你的朋友帕尔帕廷议长
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

325
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,380
提防他什么?
Be careful of what?

326
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,130
- 他指明要你出席 - 为什么?
- He has requested your presence. - What for?

327
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,420
他没说
He would not say.

328
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,090
他没有先通知委员会?很不寻常  是不是?
He didn't inform the council? That's unusual, isn't it?

329
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,430
这一切都很不寻常
All of this is unusual.

330
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,880
所以才让我感到不安
And it's making me feel uneasy.

331
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,870
我希望你相信我  阿纳金
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

332
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,110
当然
Of course.

333
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,160
孩子  我需要你的帮助
I need your help, son.

334
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,330
什么意思?
What do you mean?

335
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,000
我全靠你了
I'm depending on you.

336
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,620
为什么?我不明白
For what? I don't understand.

337
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,350
去做共和国的眼睛、耳朵和声音吧...
To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.

338
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,080
阿纳金...
Anakin...

339
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,810
我将指定你做我在委员会上的私人代表
I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.

340
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,270
我?
Me?

341
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,440
当大师?
A master?

342
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,690
我担当不起
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

343
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,700
委员会是自行选择成员的  他们不会接受的
But the council elects its own members. They'll never accept this.

344
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,320
我想他们会的 他们需要你
I think they will. They need you.

345
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,120
比你所想象的更需要
More than you know.

346
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,300
委员会是不会轻易承认这种指派的
Allow this appointment lightly the council does not.

347
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,850
令人不解的是  提出这种要求的是帕尔帕廷议长
Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.

348
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,600
我明白
I understand.

349
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,050
你是委员会的成员...
You are on this council...

350
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,760
但是我们不会给你大师头衔
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

351
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,890
什么?
What?

352
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,360
你们怎么可以这样?我无法忍受
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

353
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,040
这不公平
It's unfair.

354
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,240
既是成员  怎么可以没有头衔呢?
How can you be on the council and not be a master?

355
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,880
坐下说  年轻的天行者
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

356
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,590
原谅我  大师
Forgive me, Master.

357
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,220
我们已经检查过共和国内的所有星系
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...

358
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,050
但是找不到格里弗斯的踪影
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

359
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,940
他一定躲在外围星系里了
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

360
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,150
你们也要检查一下边远的星系
The outlying systems you must sweep.

361
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,490
我们的船不够
We do not have many ships to spare.

362
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,770
另外帝国军攻打伍基人的事情怎么办?
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

363
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,570
我们必须马上派出援军
It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.

364
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,120
对  我们不能再失去一个星系了
He's right. It's a system we cannot afford to lose.

365
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,540
我会去的
Go I will.

366
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,670
我跟伍基人的关系很好
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

367
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,380
那就这么办
It's settled then.

368
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,010
尤达将带一队克隆兵
Yoda will take a battalion of clones

369
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,500
到卡希克支援伍基人
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

370
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,680
愿原力与我们同在
May the Force be with us all.

371
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,560
这算什么?
What kind of nonsense is this?

372
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,060
让我加入委员会  却不给我大师头衔?
Put me on the council and not make me a master?

373
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,940
绝地武士的历史上从来没有过  这是一种羞辱
It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.

374
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,900
冷静点  阿纳金  你已经很受重用了
Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honour.

375
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,980
在你这个年龄就得以加入委员会  这从来都没有过的
To be on the council at your age... it's never happened before.

376
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,530
事实是你跟议长关系太密切了
The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor.

377
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,410
委员会并不喜欢他过多的干涉绝地武士的事务
The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

378
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,910
我对你发誓  我没有要求过进入委员会
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.

379
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,250
但你心里是这么想的
But it's what you wanted.

380
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,670
你跟议长的交情看来有回报了
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.

381
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,670
那跟这没有关系
That has nothing to do with this.

382
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,720
委员会批准任命你的唯一理由
The only reason the council has approved your appointment...

383
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,170
就是议长对你的信任
is because the chancellor trusts you.

384
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,180
还有呢?
And?

385
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,480
阿纳金  我是站在你这边的
Anakin, I am on your side.

386
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,060
我不想你陷入这样的状况
I didn't want to put you in this situation.

387
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,350
什么状况?
What situation?

388
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,770
委员会希望你可以报告议长的一举一动
The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings.

389
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,230
他们想知道他到底想做什么
They want to know what he's up to.

390
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,780
他们想让我去监视议长?
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

391
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,380
- 那是叛国   - 我们在战争中  阿纳金
- But that's treason. - We are at war, Anakin.

392
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,340
为什么会议上委员会不直接指派我这项任务?
Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?

393
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,880
这项任务是不作记录的
This assignment is not to be on record.

394
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,930
议长并没有那么坏  欧比王
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

395
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,060
他对我很好  从我第一次来就很关照我
He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

396
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,260
所以你必须帮助我们
That is why you must help us.

397
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,850
阿纳金  我们效忠的是议会
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader...

398
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,650
而不是一个任期已满却不肯下台的领导者
who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.

399
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,740
是议会让他连任的
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

400
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,030
是的  但是你仔细想想  阿纳金  这样是不是不太合适
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.

401
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,330
你叫我做的事情违背了绝地武士的原则
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code.

402
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,330
违背了共和国  违背了一位良师和知己
Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend.

403
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,410
这些才是不合适的  为什么叫我做这件事?
That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?

404
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,630
是委员会要你做的
The council is asking you.

405
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,550
阿纳金似乎对他的新任务不太热衷
Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.

406
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,650
他们两个在一起实在太危险了
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

407
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,070
我觉得这孩子肯定处理不好
I don't think the boy can handle it.

408
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,110
我信不过他
I don't trust him.

409
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,030
大师  冒昧地问一下  难道他不是预言中的那个人吗?
With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one?

410
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,450
难道不该是他来毁灭西斯  恢复原力的平衡吗?
Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?

411
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,410
预言是这么说的
So the prophecy says.

412
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,420
预言也可能误导了我们
A prophecy that misread could have been.

413
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,130
他不会让我失望的
He will not let me down.

414
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,170
从来都没有
He never has.

415
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,310
希望你是对的
I hope right you are.

416
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,210
有时我在想  绝地武士的原则到底怎么了
Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order.

417
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,170
我认为战争正在破坏着共和国的法则
I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

418
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,220
你有没有想过也许我们都站错边了?
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?

419
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,220
什么意思?
What do you mean?

420
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,520
会不会我们一直信奉着的民主政治已经不复存在?
What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists...

421
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,230
共和国是不是已经沦为了我们致力消灭的邪恶组织?
and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?

422
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,570
我不相信 你怎么听起来像分裂分子
I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist.

423
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,490
这场战争代表了开明政治的失败
This war represents a failure to listen.

424
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,610
现在  你是议长最亲近的人
Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone.

425
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,000
求你叫他停止战争  恢复民主吧
Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

426
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,660
别跟我说这些
Don't ask me to do that.

427
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,870
这种事情要去跟议会说  我可管不了
Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs.

428
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,800
- 怎么了? - 没什么
- What is it? - Nothing.

429
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,970
别这样  别把我也关在心门之外  让我帮助你好吗
Don't do this. Don't shut me out. Let me help you.

430
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,230
抱着我
Hold me.

431
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,590
就像在纳布的湖边
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

432
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,440
就像以前  我们之间只有爱情
So long ago, when there was nothing but our love.

433
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,070
没有政治  没有算计  没有战争
No politics, no plotting, no war.

434
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,990
- 你有事找我  议长? - 对  阿纳金
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor. - Yes, Anakin.

435
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,070
过来 我有好消息
Come closer. I have good news.

436
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,660
我们的克隆人情报机关...
Our clone intelligence units...

437
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,830
已经找到格里弗斯将军的行踪了
have discovered the location of General Grievous.

438
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,530
他躲在尤塔帕星系
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

439
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,830
可找到他了
At last.

440
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,420
终于可以抓到这个大魔头结束战争了
We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.

441
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,880
如果委员会不派你参与此项任务的话
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council...

442
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,380
我将对他们的集体智慧产生怀疑
if it didn't select you for this assignment.

443
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,850
目前为止  你是最佳的选择
You're the best choice, by far.

444
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,360
坐下
Sit down.

445
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,680
你们退下
Leave us.

446
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,680
阿纳金
Anakin.

447
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,710
你知道我不能依赖于绝地委员会
You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council.

448
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,840
如果他们还没把你纳入计划  他们很快也会和你说的
If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.

449
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,880
我不太明白您的意思
I'm not sure I understand.

450
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,680
你应该感觉得到我的疑虑
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

451
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:23,180
绝地委员会想完全控制共和国
The Jedi Council want control of the Republic.

452
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,470
他们计划背叛我
They're planning to betray me.

453
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,560
- 我想不是吧... - 阿纳金
- I don't think that... - Anakin.

454
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,690
你好好感觉一下
Search your feelings.

455
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,440
你知道的  不是吗?
You know, don't you?

456
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,750
我知道他们不信任你
I know they don't trust you.

457
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,160
或者是议会 或是共和国
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

458
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,870
或是民主  就此而言
Or democracy, for that matter.

459
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,000
我必须承认  我对他们的信任已经动摇了
I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.

460
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,590
为什么?
Why?

461
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,930
是不是他们让你做一些
They asked you to do something that

462
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,050
有悖你良心的事情?
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

463
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,940
他们让你监视我  是不是?
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

464
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,490
我不知道...
I don't...

465
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,990
我不知道该说些什么
I don't know what to say.

466
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,570
还记得以前的教诲吧
Remember back to your early teachings.

467
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,070
“所有获得权力的人都会害怕失去权力”
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

468
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,840
- 绝地武士也是如此 - 绝地武士是用他们的力量行善
- Even the Jedi. - The Jedi use their power for good.

469
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,090
所谓的“善”不过是相对而言  阿纳金
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

470
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,380
西斯和绝地武士在几乎所有方面都相似
The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way...

471
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,180
包括对更强力量的追求
including their quest for greater power.

472
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,730
西斯依赖内心的激情去获取力量
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength.

473
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,610
他们只在乎自身
They think inwards... only about themselves.

474
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,060
难道绝地武士不是这样?
And the Jedi don't?

475
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,730
绝地武士很无私  他们只关心他人
The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others.

476
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,880
你听说过西斯黑暗君主  达斯.普雷厄斯的悲剧吗?
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

477
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
没有
No.

478
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,060
我想也是 绝地武士是不会把这故事告诉你的
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

479
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,480
这是一个西斯的传说
It's a Sith legend.

480
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,610
达斯.普雷厄斯曾是西斯的一位黑暗君主...
Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith...

481
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,610
非常强大而且充满智慧...
so powerful and so wise...

482
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,570
他甚至可以使用原力影响迷地原虫
he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians...

483
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,870
来创造生命
to create... life.

484
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,580
他对黑暗原力如此的了解
He had such a knowledge of the dark side...

485
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,170
使他可以让自己关心的人
he could even keep the ones he cared about...

486
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,760
起死回生
from dying.

487
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,840
他真的可以...让人起死回生?
He could actually... save people from death?

488
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,220
原力黑暗的一面可以通往许多奇异能力
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities...

489
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,570
有些被认为是非自然的
some consider to be unnatural.

490
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,530
他后来怎么样?
What happened to him?

491
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,700
他变得非常强大
He became so powerful...

492
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,070
他在这世上只害怕一件事
the only thing he was afraid of was...

493
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,160
就是失去他的力量
losing his power.

494
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,420
但最终他还是失去了力量
Which eventually, of course, he did.

495
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:33,790
他把所有的知识传授给了他的徒弟
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.

496
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,220
因此他徒弟就趁他睡觉时将他杀了
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

497
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,180
真是讽刺
It's ironic.

498
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,430
他可以让别人起死回生
He could save others from death...

499
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,640
但却无法救他自己
but not himself.

500
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,360
有可能学到这种力量吗?
Is it possible to learn this power?

501
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,320
从绝地武士那里可学不到
Not from a Jedi.

502
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,100
所有红色单位   到这边集合！
All Red units, over here!

503
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,270
帕尔帕廷认为格里弗斯将军在尤塔帕星球?
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

504
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,990
截获了只言片语...
A partial message was intercepted...

505
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,570
从尤塔帕星首领发出的一份外交信息中
in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau.

506
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,240
我们必须行动起来
Act on this we must.

507
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,080
抓住格里弗斯将军就可以结束这场战争
The capture of General Grievous will end this war.

508
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,000
我们必须速战速决
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

509
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,140
议长要求由我来领导这次战役
The chancellor has requested... that I lead the campaign.

510
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,550
这事由绝地委员会决定
The council will make up its own mind who is to go...

511
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,640
议长无权干涉
not the chancellor.

512
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:07,680
我们需要一位经验丰富的大师
A master is needed, with more experience.

513
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,180
我推举  由克诺比大师领衔
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

514
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,810
我同意
I agree.

515
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,060
同意
Aye.

516
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,740
同意
Aye.

517
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,780
很好  会议结束
Very well. Council adjourned.

518
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,380
机器人部队已经启动了主发电机
The droids have started up their main power generators.

519
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,960
- 是时候开战了  指挥官 - 是的  长官
- Then now the time is, Commander. - Yes, sir.

520
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,110
冲啊！
Charge!

521
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,160
注意掩护！
Head for cover!

522
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,470
- 这次你需要我的帮助   - 我同意
- You're gonna need me on this one. - I agree.

523
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,440
不过  搞不好这次会变成一场班沙星的追逐
However, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.

524
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,680
师父
Master.

525
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,200
我让你失望了
I've disappointed you.

526
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,950
我并不是很感激你对我的栽培之恩
I haven't been very appreciative of your training.

527
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,820
我一直都自以为是  我很抱歉
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

528
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,900
我对绝地委员会感到非常失望
I've just been so frustrated with the council.

529
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,950
你既强大又聪明  阿纳金  我以你为荣
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you.

530
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,660
我从小就开始训练你
I have trained you since you were a small boy.

531
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,880
我所知道的一切都已经教给你了
I have taught you everything I know.

532
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,760
你已经成为一名真正的绝地武士  甚至超出了我的期望
And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

533
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,550
但是耐心点  阿纳金
But be patient, Anakin.

534
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,600
绝地委员会很快就会让你成为大师的
It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.

535
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,240
欧比旺  愿原力与你同在
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

536
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,240
再见  老朋友  愿原力与你同在
Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

537
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,120
幸运的是  大部分城市
Fortunately, most of the cities are

538
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,390
都集中在这一小块大陆
concentrated on this small continent here.

539
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,150
在远端
On the far side.

540
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,560
我会吸引他们的注意力  直到你们到达
I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

541
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,400
只要别太久就行
Just don't take too long.

542
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,110
得了  我何时让你失望过?
Come on. When have I ever let you down?

543
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,500
非常好  我身上的累赘就是
Very well. The burden is on me

544
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,660
在你们到来之前不会干掉所有的机器人士兵
not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.

545
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,850
节省点力气
Save your energy.

546
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,310
我做不到
I can't.

547
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,190
不要放弃  帕德梅
Don't give up, Padm?

548
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,540
欧比旺来过  对吧?
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

549
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,290
他今早来过
He came by this morning.

550
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,590
他想要干嘛?
What did he want?

551
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,630
他很担心你
He's worried about you.

552
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,380
他说你最近承受着很大的压力
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

553
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,930
我感觉自己迷失了
I feel lost.

554
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,230
迷失了?什么意思?
Lost? What do you mean?

555
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,520
欧比旺和绝地委员会不信任我
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

556
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,020
他们用自己的生命来信任你
They trust you with their lives.

557
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,240
发生了一些事情
Something's happening.

558
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,570
我并不是一个称职的绝地武士
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

559
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,870
我想要更多
I want more.

560
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,000
但我知道自己不应该
And I know I shouldn't.

561
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,090
你对自己期望过多了
You expect too much of yourself.

562
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,270
- 我找到了救你的方法 - 救我?
- I found a way to save you. - Save me?

563
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,300
从我的梦魇中
From my nightmares.

564
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,350
是这事一直困扰着你吗?
Is that what's bothering you?

565
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,310
我不会失去你的  帕德梅
I won't lose you, Padm?

566
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,230
我不会难产而死的  亲爱的
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

567
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,770
- 我向你保证 - 不  我向你保证
- I promise you. - No, I promise you.

568
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,120
你好  年轻的绝地武士
Greetings, young Jedi.

569
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,660
你为什么来到我们这颗遥远的避难行星?
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

570
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,700
很不幸  是因为战争
Unfortunately, the war.

571
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,370
这里没有战争  除非你带来了战争
There's no war here... unless you brought it with you.

572
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,670
如果你允许的话  我想补充点燃料
With your kind permission, I should like some fuel...

573
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,700
同时借用你的城市作为基地
and to use your city as a base

574
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,710
在附近行星搜寻格里弗斯将军
as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

575
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,980
他就在这里  我们全是人质
He is here. We are being held hostage.

576
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,980
- 他们正在监视着我们 - 我明白了
- They are watching us. - I understand.

577
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,910
他们在第十层  有成千上万的战斗机器人
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

578
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,440
让你的人民做好避难准备
Tell your people to take shelter.

579
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,540
如果你有士兵  现在是派上用场的时候了
If you have warriors, now is the time.

580
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,680
把战斗机开回母舰去  告诉科迪  我已经联系好了
Take the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I've made contact.

581
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,720
- 他会带更多的士兵来吗? - 他没说
- Is he bringing additional warriors? - He didn't say.

582
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:34,270
共和国的军队很快就会追踪到这里
It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here.

583
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:42,120
我要你们到外围星系的穆斯塔法去
I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim.

584
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,920
那是一个多火山的星球
It is a volcanic planet.

585
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,330
- 在那里你会安全的 - 安全?
- You will be safe there. - Safe?

586
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,430
将军  你让帕尔帕廷议长从你手上溜掉
Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General.

587
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,970
没有了杜库伯爵  我怀疑你是否还有能力保障我们的安全
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.

588
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:10,020
说谢谢吧  总督  你得庆幸没有落到我的手上
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip.

589
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,150
你们的飞船准备好了
Your ship is waiting.

590
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,300
大家好
Hello there.

591
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,680
克诺比将军
General Kenobi.

592
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,180
你真是有勇无谋
You are a bold one.

593
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,690
干掉他
Kill him.

594
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,950
后退
Back away.

595
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,660
我亲自来对付这个绝地废物
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

596
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,260
你出招吧
Your move.

597
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,800
你这傻瓜
You fool.

598
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:20,720
杜库伯爵曾教过我你们绝地武士的剑术
I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

599
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,730
出招吧  克诺比
Attack, Kenobi.

600
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,390
不管你有没有军队
Army or not...

601
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,600
你得知道自己已经大难临头了
you must realize you are doomed.

602
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,700
我可不这样想
I don't think so.

603
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,880
掩护那边
Cover that corner.

604
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,970
温杜大师  我可以打断一下吗?
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

605
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,860
克诺比将军已和格里弗斯将军交上手
General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous...

606
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,220
我们已经开始进攻了
and we have begun our attack.

607
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,070
谢谢你  指挥官
Thank you, Commander.

608
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,270
阿纳金  把这报告转呈议长
Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.

609
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,650
他的反应会暴露他的意图
His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.

610
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,240
是的  大师
Yes, Master.

611
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,170
我感觉有人在密谋毁灭绝地武士
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

612
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,540
黑暗原力笼罩着议长
The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor.

613
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,470
如果他不愿放弃他的紧急权力...
If he does not give up his emergency powers...

614
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,470
在格里弗斯被歼灭后...
after the destruction of Grievous...

615
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,800
那他应该被逐出政府
then he should be removed from office.

616
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,800
绝地委员会应该接管议会
The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate...

617
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,810
以便权力能安全和平地移交
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

618
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,400
也许这想法会将我们带入绝境
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.

619
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,360
我们必须得小心行事
Great care we must take.

620
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,660
议长
Chancellor.

621
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,950
我们刚收到克诺比大师发来的报告
We've just received a report from Master Kenobi.

622
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,710
他已和格里弗斯将军交战了
He has engaged General Grievous.

623
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,170
我们只能希望克诺比大师能够应付这次挑战
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.

624
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,010
我应该到那里和他并肩战斗
I should be there with him.

625
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,460
看起来绝地委员会并不完全认同你的才能
It's upsetting to me to see that the council...

626
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,640
这让我很难过
doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.

627
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,060
你难道不想知道他们为何不让你成为绝地大师吗?
Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master?

628
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,730
我希望自己知道原因
I wish I knew.

629
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,560
我越来越觉得自己
More and more I get the feeling that...

630
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,900
被排斥在绝地委员会之外
I'm being excluded from the council.

631
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,830
我知道他们没有把有些关于原力的知识告诉我
I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.

632
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,500
他们不信任你  阿纳金
They don't trust you, Anakin.

633
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,250
他们看到了你的未来
They see your future.

634
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:59,250
他们知道你的力量会超越他们的控制
They know your power will be too strong to control.

635
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,950
你必须看穿这些谎言迷雾
You must break through the fog of lies

636
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,470
绝地武士散布在你周围的的谎言
the Jedi have created around you.

637
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,650
让我帮助你了解原力的奥妙
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

638
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,530
你怎么会知道使用原力的方法?
How do you know the ways of the Force?

639
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:18,610
我师父教会了我所有关于原力的知识
My mentor taught me everything about the Force.

640
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:22,370
甚至包括黑暗原力的本质
Even the nature of the dark side.

641
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,700
你了解黑暗原力?
You know the dark side?

642
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,670
阿纳金
Anakin.

643
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,620
如果一个人想要通晓原力的奥妙
If one is to understand the great mystery...

644
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,130
就必须研究其方方面面
one must study all its aspects...

645
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:38,380
而不仅仅是绝地武士那些狭隘的教条
not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi.

646
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,260
如果你想成为一位睿智、十足的领袖人物
If you wish to become a complete and wise leader...

647
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,060
你必须更多的去了解原力
you must embrace a larger view of the Force.

648
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,810
小心那些绝地武士  阿纳金
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

649
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:55,020
只有通过我你才能获得比绝地武士更强大的力量
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.

650
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,400
学会了使用黑暗原力
Learn to know the dark side of the Force...

651
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,150
你就可以把你的妻子
and you will be able to save your wife...

652
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,330
从死亡的命运中解救出来
from certain death.

653
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,330
你说什么?
What did you say?

654
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,080
希望你能运用我的知识
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

655
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,960
你是西斯君主
You're the Sith lord.

656
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:18,930
我知道是什么困扰着你  听我说
I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me.

657
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:23,600
别再继续当绝地委员会手中的小卒子
Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.

658
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,190
从我认识你起  你就在追寻一种
Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life...

659
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,860
比寻常绝地武士更为伟大的人生
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

660
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,360
一种具有重要意义的人生
A life of significance...

661
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,950
一种道德的人生
of conscience.

662
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,240
- 你想要杀我吗?    - 我当然会这样做
- Are you going to kill me? - I would certainly like to.

663
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,710
我知道你会
I know you would.

664
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,620
我能感受到你的愤怒
I can feel your anger.

665
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,430
它使你全神贯注
It gives you focus...

666
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,880
使你更加强大
makes you stronger.

667
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,510
我要把你交给绝地委员会
I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.

668
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,270
当然你该这么做
Of course. You should.

669
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,400
但是你并不清楚他们的目的  对吧?
But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?

670
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,020
我很快就会发现这一切的真相
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

671
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,570
你很聪明  阿纳金
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

672
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,320
来了解黑暗原力吧
Know the power of the dark side.

673
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,210
这是一种可以拯救帕德梅的力量
Power to save Padm?

674
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,920
真原始
So uncivilized.

675
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,430
温杜大师  我得和你谈谈
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

676
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,450
天行者  我们刚得知
Skywalker, we just received word that

677
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,350
欧比旺消灭了格里弗斯将军
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

678
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,360
现在我们去确保...
We're on our way to make sure...

679
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,730
议长将紧急特权交还议会
the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.

680
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,480
他不会放弃他的权力  我刚得知一个可怕的事实
He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth.

681
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,740
我想帕尔帕廷议长就是西斯君主
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.

682
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,740
西斯君主?
A Sith lord?

683
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,710
是的  就是我们一直在寻找的家伙
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

684
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,830
- 你怎么会知道这事? - 他懂得原力
- How do you know this? - He knows the ways of the Force.

685
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,000
他受过使用黑暗原力的训练
He's been trained to use the dark side.

686
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,920
- 你确信? - 完全确信
- Are you sure? - Absolutely.

687
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,590
那我们最害怕的事就成真了
Then our worst fears have been realized.

688
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,170
为了绝地武士团的生死存亡  我们得赶快行动
We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive.

689
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,720
大师  议长非常强大
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

690
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,090
如果你要去逮捕他  你需要我的帮助
You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.

691
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:28,150
你还是不要插手此事为好
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

692
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,030
我能感觉到你内心的迷惑  年轻的天行者
I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker.

693
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,280
恐惧蒙蔽了你的判断力
There is much fear that clouds your judgement.

694
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,360
- 大师  我必须去 - 不行
- I must go, Master. - No.

695
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,530
如果你所言属实  你就会得到我的信任
If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust.

696
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,200
但现在  留在这里
But for now, remain here.

697
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,200
在绝地委员会议事厅等我们回来
Wait in the council chambers until we return.

698
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,750
是的  大师
Yes, Master.

699
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,110
你知道的  对吧?
You do know, don't you...

700
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,570
如果绝地武士杀掉了我
if theJedi destroy me...

701
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:30,660
你就无望拯救她的生命了
any chance of saving her will be lost.

702
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,010
温杜大师  我猜格里弗斯将军已被歼灭
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then.

703
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,390
你们比我想的干得还要快
I must say you're here sooner than expected.

704
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,110
以银河共和国议会的名义
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

705
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,150
你被逮了  议长
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

706
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,850
你在威胁我吗  大师?
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

707
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:17,900
议会将决定你的命运
The senate will decide your fate.

708
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:21,870
- 我就是议会  - 还不是
- I am the senate. - Not yet.

709
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,540
那这就是叛变行为
It's treason then.

710
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,060
你被捕了  君主殿下
You are under arrest, my lord.

711
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,490
阿纳金  我告诉过你他们会这样做 我说对了
Anakin, I told you it would come to this. I was right.

712
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,740
绝地武士想要篡权
The Jedi are taking over.

713
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,330
西斯横行的时代过去了
The oppression of the Sith will never return.

714
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,660
你已经输了
You have lost.

715
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,170
不
No.

716
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,500
不！  才不！
No! No!

717
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:30,450
要死的是你！
You will die!

718
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,090
他是个叛徒！
He's a traitor!

719
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,380
他才是叛徒！
He is the traitor!

720
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,720
我有能力拯救你爱的人
I have the power to save the one you love.

721
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:47,640
你必须作出选择
You must choose.

722
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:51,310
别听他的  阿纳金！
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

723
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,030
别让他杀我
Don't let him kill me.

724
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,860
我坚持不住了...
I can't hold it any longer.

725
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,280
我不行了 我很虚弱
I can't. I'm weak.

726
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,370
太虚弱了
I'm too weak.

727
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,350
阿纳金
Anakin.

728
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,500
救救我！
Help me. Help me!

729
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,170
我坚持不下去了
I can't hold on any longer.

730
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,890
我现在就能解决你  一劳永逸
I am going to end this once and for all.

731
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,480
你不能...
You can't.

732
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,560
他必须接受审判
He must stand trial.

733
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,010
他已经控制了议会和法院
He has control of the senate and the courts.

734
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:30,360
他太危险了  必须除掉他
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

735
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,730
我太虚弱了
I'm too weak.

736
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:36,450
- 求你饶我一命 - 这不是绝地武士的处事方式
- Don't kill me. Please. - It's not the Jedi way.

737
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,070
他必须活下去
He must live.

738
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,740
- 请别杀他 - 我需要他
- Please don't. - I need him.

739
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:45,870
- 别这样！   - 不！
- Please don't! - No!

740
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,930
力量！
Power!

741
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,140
无尽的力量！
Unlimited power!

742
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,320
我干了什么?
What have I done?

743
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:31,540
你在履践自己的命运  阿纳金
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

744
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,460
成为我的徒弟
Become my apprentice.

745
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:41,020
研习黑暗原力
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

746
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,640
我听从你的吩咐
I will do whatever you ask.

747
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,270
很好
Good.

748
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,560
只要你能助我拯救帕德梅的生命
Just help me save Padm?s life.

749
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:59,910
没有她我也不能独活
I can't live without her.

750
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:08,460
古往今来只有一人曾习得起死回生之术...
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved...

751
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,540
但如果我们一起研习...
but if we work together...

752
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:15,670
我肯定我们能洞悉其奥秘
I know we can discover the secret.

753
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,130
我发誓忠于...
I pledge myself...

754
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,720
您的教诲
to your teachings.

755
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,390
好
Good.

756
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,690
很好
Good.

757
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:41,360
你的原力很强
The Force is strong with you.

758
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:47,040
你将会成一个无比强大的西斯
A powerful Sith you will become.

759
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:51,420
从今以后  你将被认为是...
Henceforth you shall be known as...

760
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:55,420
达斯... 维德
Darth... Vader.

761
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:03,390
感谢您  我的恩师
Thank you, my master.

762
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,060
免礼
Rise.

763
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,670
我年轻的徒弟  因为绝地委员会不信任你
Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice...

764
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:32,000
所以我相信你是唯一对他们的阴谋毫不知情的绝地武士
I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.

765
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,050
如果那些绝地武士知道了他们的阴谋已经败露
When the Jedi learn what has transpired here...

766
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,090
他们会杀掉我们  连同所有的参议员一起
they will kill us, along with all the senators.

767
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,350
我同意
I agree.

768
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,930
绝地委员会下一步就会推翻议会
The council's next move will be against the senate.

769
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,730
每一名绝地武士
Every single Jedi...

770
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:53,110
包括你的好友欧比旺.克诺比...
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

771
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,770
现在都是共和国的敌人
is now an enemy of the Republic.

772
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,780
我明白  师父
I understand, Master.

773
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,490
我们得赶快行动
We must move quickly.

774
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,530
这些绝地武士冷酷无情
The Jedi are relentless.

775
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:10,460
如果不将他们赶尽杀绝  恐怕这场内战永无止息
If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.

776
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,960
首先  我要你去绝地圣殿
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

777
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:20,090
我们要攻他们一个措手不及
We will catch them off-balance.

778
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:24,180
去做该做的事吧  维德勋爵
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

779
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,680
不要犹豫不决  不要心慈手软
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

780
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,150
只有那样你才会有足够强大的黑暗原力
Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side...

781
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,270
以拯救帕德梅
to save Padm?

782
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:40,240
那其他分散在星系间的绝地武士怎么办?
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

783
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:43,450
他们的背叛行为会得到处置
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

784
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,630
在你干掉圣殿里的绝地武士后
After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple...

785
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:51,420
赶往穆斯塔法
go to the Mustafar system.

786
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:54,800
杀掉刚雷总督
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

787
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,340
和其他分裂分子的首领
and the other separatist leaders.

788
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:04,350
西斯将再一次一统整个星系！
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

789
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,310
同时
And...

790
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,520
我们将会得到和平
we shall have... peace.

791
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,610
中士  过来！
Sergeant, over here!

792
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,570
所有人快跟上！
Hurry! All of them!

793
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,250
所有红色单位  干掉它！
All Red units, let's move it!

794
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:07,250
过来  出发！
Come on. Let's go!

795
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,130
指挥官  联系你的部队
Commander, contact your troops.

796
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,180
叫他们去占领高层
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

797
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,190
是的  长官
Very good, sir.

798
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,440
对了  我想您会需要这个
By the way, I think you'll be needing this.

799
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,810
谢谢你  科迪  快行动  我们得尽快赢下这场战斗
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win.

800
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,110
遵命
Yes, sir.

801
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,370
科迪指挥官...
Commander Cody...

802
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,370
时机成熟了
the time has come.

803
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,750
执行66号令
Execute order 66.

804
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,420
是的  陛下
Yes, my lord.

805
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,630
轰掉他！
Blast him!

806
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,000
跟我来！
Come on!

807
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:21,720
执行66号令
Execute order 66.

808
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,350
遵命  陛下
It will be done, my lord.

809
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,150
遵命  陛下
It will be done, my lord.

810
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,390
天行者大师  敌人太多了
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them.

811
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,480
我们该怎么办?
What are we going to do?

812
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,060
从议长办公室传来的消息
The chancellor's office indicated

813
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,120
说阿纳金主人回绝地圣殿了
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

814
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,330
别太担心  夫人  我肯定他不会有事的
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right.

815
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,610
- 这是怎么了? - 发生了叛乱  阁下
- What's going on here? - There's been a rebellion, sir.

816
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,320
别担心  局势已在我们的控制之下
Don't worry. The situation is under control.

817
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,660
对不起  阁下  您该走了
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

818
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,380
的确如此
And so it is.

819
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,970
干掉他！
Get him!

820
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:08,540
不！
No!

821
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,400
不用管他  让他去吧
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

822
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,230
所有的胡基人全死了  赶去东线
All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

823
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,810
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

824
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,820
再见  塔弗尔
Goodbye, Tarfful.

825
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,910
再见  丘巴卡
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

826
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,620
我会想你们的
Miss you I will.

827
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,990
希望我能及时拯救一部分绝地武士...
Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi...

828
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,410
在他们卷入这场灾难之前
before they walk into this catastrophe.

829
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,080
你找到克诺比了吗?
Did you find Kenobi?

830
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:55,130
长官  这么高掉下去无人能存活
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

831
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,500
让你的人上飞船
Start loading your men on the ships.

832
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,100
赶快
Move it.

833
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:35,420
九一三号紧急代码
Emergency code 913.

834
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,430
我在所有频段都联系不上
I have no contact on any frequency.

835
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,590
克诺比大师
Master Kenobi.

836
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,680
- 重复 - 克诺比大师
- Repeat. - Master Kenobi.

837
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:47,730
奥加纳参议员  我的克隆人部队伏击我  我需要帮助
Senator Organa. My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

838
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,610
我们刚刚救出了尤达大师
We havejust rescued Master Yoda.

839
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,810
这种都有人遭到暗算
It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.

840
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,070
我们把坐标传给你
We're sending you our coordinates.

841
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,710
嘘！  轻一点
Hush! Not so loud.

842
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:07,830
你没事吧?我听说有人袭击了绝地圣殿
Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple.

843
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,330
- 从这里都能看见冒出来的烟 - 我没事
- You could see the smoke from here. - I'm fine.

844
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,340
我来看看你和孩子是否安全
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

845
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:14,090
发生什么事了?
What's happening?

846
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:17,050
绝地武士想颠覆共和国
The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.

847
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:19,680
难以置信
I can't believe that.

848
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:23,340
我亲眼看到温杜大师试图刺杀议长
I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.

849
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:27,940
阿纳金  你打算怎么办?
Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?

850
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,820
我不会背叛共和国...
I will not betray the Republic.

851
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:42,740
我效忠于议长...
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

852
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,620
议会... 和你
and with the senate and with you.

853
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:50,620
- 那欧比旺呢? - 我不知道
- What about Obi-Wan? - I don't know.

854
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,460
许多绝地武士已被处决
Many Jedi have been killed.

855
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,430
我们只能希望他仍忠于议长
We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

856
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:59,840
阿纳金  我害怕
Anakin, I'm afraid.

857
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,890
相信我  我的爱人
Have faith, my love.

858
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,310
这一切很快就会变好的
Everything will soon be set right.

859
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:11,190
议长交给我一件非常重要的任务
The chancellor has given me a very important mission.

860
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,150
分裂主义分子现在聚集在穆斯塔法系
The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system.

861
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:18,740
我要去那里结束这场战争 等我回来
I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return.

862
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:21,240
我保证  一切都会不同的
Things will be different. I promise.

863
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:29,040
请等我回来
Please, wait for me.

864
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:35,840
他承受着很大的压力  R2
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

865
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,010
保重  我的小朋友
Take care, my little friend.

866
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:47,980
夫人  有什么我能效劳的吗?
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

867
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:50,650
不用  谢谢你  3PO
No, thank you, 3PO.

868
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,440
我感到很无助
I feel so helpless.

869
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,640
还有多少绝地武士生还?
How many other Jedi have managed to survive?

870
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:24,310
我们还没有消息
Heard from no one have we.

871
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:28,270
我看见成千上万的军队攻击绝地圣殿
I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple.

872
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,270
所以我才来找尤达
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

873
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,810
圣殿里的人有消息么?
Have we had any contact from the temple?

874
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:35,900
我们收到了一条加密的撤退讯息
Received a coded retreat message we have.

875
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:40,030
要求所有的绝地武士回到圣殿里去
It requests all Jedi to return to the temple.

876
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,580
- 讯息说战争结束了 - 那么我们必须得回去
- It says the war is over. - Then we must go back.

877
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:45,460
如果有任何士兵掉队了
If there are any stragglers,

878
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,210
他们会落进陷阱而被杀的
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

879
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:52,130
你是想去撤销那个加密信号?
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

880
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,960
是的  大师  我们冒不起这个险
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

881
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,640
我同意
I agree.

882
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,350
多知道一些事会让我们的前途更光明
And a little more knowledge might light our way.

883
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,750
计划如你所预料的正在顺利进行  我的主人
The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord.

884
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,630
干的不错  总督
You have done well, Viceroy.

885
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:34,540
我的新徒弟  达斯.维德到了以后
When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives...

886
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,180
他会关照你们的
he will take care of you.

887
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:52,940
我们从议长办公室收到一条讯息  长官
We're receiving a message from the chancellor's office, sir.

888
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:54,980
- 接过来 - 好的  长官
- Send it through. - Yes, sir.

889
01:31:56,740 --> 01:32:01,400
奥加纳参议员  共和国最高议长要求你出席
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence...

890
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,500
议会的特别会议
at a special session of Congress.

891
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:07,160
- 我会去的 - 他会恭候您的到来
- I will be there. - He'll be expecting you.

892
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:13,420
- 这可能是个陷阱 - 我觉得不是
- Could be a trap. - I don't think so.

893
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:15,090
议长是没有办法
The chancellor will not be able to

894
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,640
控制上千之众的星系的...
control the thousands of star systems...

895
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,670
除非议院保持不变
without keeping the senate intact.

896
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,800
有这个特别会议
If a special session of Congress there is...

897
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:26,220
更方便我们进入绝地圣殿
easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be.

898
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,690
R2...呆在飞船这儿
R2, stay with the ship.

899
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:35,130
欢迎  维德勋爵  恭候大驾已多时
Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

900
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,500
绝地武士的叛变已经被挫败
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

901
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:12,660
发生什么事了?
What's happened?

902
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,050
议长正在解释说...
The chancellor's been elaborating on...

903
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,300
绝地武士阴谋推翻议会
a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

904
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:22,890
余下的绝地武士会被追剿并打败
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.

905
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,160
连幼徒们也没放过
Not even the younglings survived.

906
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:47,630
这名弟子不是被克隆兵杀死的
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

907
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:51,290
是激光剑刺死的
By a lightsabre he was.

908
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,720
是谁?
Who?

909
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:01,720
这是谁干的?
Who could have done this?

910
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:15,610
针对我的刺杀行动...
The attempt on my life...

911
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:20,620
让我留下伤痕、容颜尽毁
has left me scarred and deformed.

912
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:24,450
但我保证
But I assure you.

913
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:29,290
我的决心从来没有这么坚定过！
My resolve has never been stronger!

914
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,710
住手！
Stop!

915
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:53,310
为了保证社会的安全和长期稳定...
In order to ensure the security and continuing stability...

916
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:57,310
共和国将重组
the Republic will be reorganized...

917
01:35:57,450 --> 01:36:02,910
成为第一个银河帝国！
into the first Galactic Empire!

918
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:09,670
为了一个安全而稳定的社会
For a safe and secure society.

919
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,140
自由就是这样死去的
So this is how liberty dies.

920
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:24,600
伴随着雷鸣般的掌声...
With thunderous applause.

921
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,180
战争结束了
The war is over.

922
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,450
西迪厄斯大人保证给我们和平的  我们只想要...
Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want...

923
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:46,240
我重新调校了信号  警告所有幸存的武士别回来
I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

924
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,780
对于克隆兵来说
For the clones...

925
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,000
要发现信号被改过了还要很久
to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.

926
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,810
等等  大师
Wait. Master.

927
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,680
有些事我必须弄明白
There is something I must know.

928
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:21,240
如果去看保安录像  你发现的只会是痛苦
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.

929
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,910
我必须知道真相  大师
I must know the truth, Master.

930
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,620
不可能...
It can't be.

931
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,630
不可能...
It can't be.

932
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,810
做得漂亮  我的新徒弟
You have done well, my new apprentice.

933
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:42,930
现在  维德勋爵
Now, Lord Vader...

934
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:46,560
去给帝国带来和平吧
go and bring peace to the Empire.

935
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:48,850
我看不下去了
I can't watch any more.

936
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:53,520
我们必须消灭西斯
Destroy the Sith we must.

937
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,400
派我去刺杀皇帝吧
Send me to kill the emperor.

938
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,780
对阿纳金我下不了手
I will not kill Anakin.

939
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:04,620
去杀西迪厄斯  你还不够强
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.

940
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:08,000
他就像我的兄弟... 我下不了手
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

941
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:13,800
年轻的天行者已经被黑暗势力扭曲
Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become.

942
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:17,300
你训导的那个孩子  已经不在了
The boy you trained, gone he is.

943
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:20,300
取而代之的是达斯.维德
Consumed by Darth Vader.

944
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:23,430
我不知道西迪厄斯把他派到哪里去了
I do not know where the emperor has sent him.

945
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,770
我不知道到哪去找他
I don't know where to look.

946
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:30,770
用你的感应  欧比旺  你会找到他的
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.

947
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:43,320
你最后一次看到他是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw him?

948
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,410
- 昨天 - 你知道他现在在哪儿么?
- Yesterday. - And do you know where he is now?

949
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,760
不知道
No.

950
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:53,920
帕德梅  我需要你的帮助
Padme, I need your help.

951
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,260
- 他现在非常危险 - 因为西斯?
- He is in grave danger. - From the Sith?

952
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,510
因为他自己
From himself.

953
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:03,170
帕德梅...
Padme...

954
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,350
阿纳金已经投向黑暗势力了
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

955
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,930
你弄错了  你怎么能那么说?
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

956
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:17,730
我看到一段全息安保录象... 记录他...
I have seen a security hologram... of him...

957
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,080
怎样屠杀了幼徒们
killing younglings.

958
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,240
不可能是阿纳金  他不会那么做的
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

959
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,290
他被谎言蒙蔽了  我们都是
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

960
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,040
这一切都是议长的阴谋
It appears that the chancellor is behind everything,

961
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,920
包括战争在内
including the war.

962
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,460
帕尔帕廷就是我们一直在找的西斯君主
Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for.

963
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,680
在杜库伯爵死后  阿纳金成了他的新徒弟
After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.

964
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,860
我不信...
I don't believe you.

965
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,740
我不信
I can't.

966
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:59,120
帕德梅...
Padme...

967
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:02,200
我必须找到他
I must find him.

968
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:06,660
你要去杀死他  是么?
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

969
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,840
他已经成为一个非常大的威胁
He has become a very great threat.

970
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:16,930
我不能
I can't.

971
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,560
阿纳金是孩子的爸爸  对么?
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

972
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,950
我很难过
I'm so sorry.

973
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,210
- 女士  让我和你一起去  - 没有危险了
- Milady, let me come with you. - There's no danger.

974
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,290
战斗结束了  只是点私事
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

975
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,790
如你所愿  女士  但我强烈反对
As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.

976
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,540
我不会有事的  队长  有些事我必须亲自去做
I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself.

977
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,050
而且3PO会照顾我的
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

978
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:41,770
哦，老天爷
Oh, dear.

979
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,550
知道吗?我发现自己...
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to...

980
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,360
开始掌握飞行技术了
get the hang of this flying business.

981
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:29,150
分裂分子已经被我消灭了  师傅
The separatists have been taken care of, my master.

982
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,150
你的任务完成了
It is finished then.

983
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:39,360
你把和平和正义又带回到了星系
You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.

984
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:44,370
向贸易联盟的舰队发条消息
Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation.

985
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:49,670
所有机器人军团要立即关闭
All droid units must shut down immediately.

986
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,500
很好  主人
Very good, my lord.

987
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,850
我看到了你的飞船
I saw your ship.

988
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,700
- 你来这干吗? - 我好担心你啊
- What are you doing out here? - I was so worried about you.

989
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,000
欧比旺告诉了我一些可怕的事
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

990
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,670
什么事?
What things?

991
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,290
他说你投靠了黑暗势力
He said you've turned to the dark side.

992
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:14,050
并且你...还杀死了幼徒
That you... killed younglings.

993
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,260
欧比旺是想让你对付我
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

994
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,260
他是关心我们的
He cares about us.

995
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,140
我们?
Us?

996
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,730
他知道了
He knows.

997
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,980
他想帮你
He wants to help you.

998
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:34,070
阿纳金  我要的只是你的爱
Anakin, all I want is your love.

999
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,520
爱救不了你  帕德梅
Love won't save you, Padm?

1000
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:39,860
- 只有我的新力量能救你 - 那值得么?
- Only my new powers can do that. - At what cost?

1001
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,370
你是个好人  别这么做
You're a good person. Don't do this.

1002
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,200
我不会像失去我母亲一样失去你的
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

1003
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:49,550
我现在比任何绝地武士所梦想过的都要强大
I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

1004
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:52,460
我这么做是为了你  为了保护你
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

1005
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,760
和我一起走吧
Come away with me.

1006
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,500
和我一起把孩子养大
Help me raise our child.

1007
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:01,430
在事情不可收拾前  离开这一切
Leave everything else behind while we still can.

1008
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,470
你没看出来么?我们不需要再逃避了
Don't you see? We don't have to run away any more.

1009
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:08,810
我给共和国带来了和平
I have brought peace to the Republic.

1010
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,770
我比议长更有力量
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

1011
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,980
我可以推翻他
I can overthrow him.

1012
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:19,110
然后我们就可以一起控制整个星系了
And together, you and I can rule the galaxy...

1013
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,650
我们想怎样就怎样
make things the way we want them to be.

1014
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
我真不敢相信...
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

1015
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:34,790
欧比旺没错  你变了
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

1016
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:39,850
我不想再听到欧比旺的事了
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.

1017
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:44,140
绝地武士背叛了我  你不可以背叛我
The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.

1018
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,850
我不认得你了
I don't know you any more.

1019
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:50,720
阿纳金...
Anakin...

1020
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:53,530
你伤透了我的心
You're breaking my heart.

1021
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:57,190
你走的这条路我跟不上
You're going down a path I can't follow.

1022
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,080
是因为欧比旺?
Because of Obi-Wan?

1023
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:02,950
是因为你所做的一切
Because of what you've done.

1024
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,990
你的计划
What you plan to do.

1025
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:08,870
现在停手  回头吧
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1026
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,920
- 我爱你  - 骗子！
- I love you. - Liar!

1027
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:15,940
不
No.

1028
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,510
你是和他一伙的！  你把他带过来杀我的
You're with him! You brought him here to kill me.

1029
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,550
放开她  阿纳金
Let her go, Anakin.

1030
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,930
放开她
Let her go.

1031
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:40,940
你唆使她背叛了我！
You turned her against me!

1032
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,740
是你自作自受
You have done that yourself.

1033
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,660
你不能把她从我身边夺走！
You will not take her from me!

1034
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,630
你的愤怒和对权力的渴望已经迫使她离开你了
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

1035
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,930
你让这黑暗的邪王吞噬你的思想...
You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind...

1036
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,690
直到现在你变成了你曾发誓要消灭的人
until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

1037
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,690
别和我讲道理  欧比旺
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1038
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:13,310
我看透了绝地武士的谎言
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

1039
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:16,820
我不像你那么惧怕黑暗势力
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1040
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,570
我给我的新的帝国带来了...
I have brought peace...

1041
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:25,450
和平 自由  正义和安全
freedom, justice and security to my new empire.

1042
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:28,580
你的新帝国?
Your new empire?

1043
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,460
别逼我杀了你
Don't make me kill you.

1044
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:37,340
阿纳金  我只对共和国制度效忠  忠于民主！
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!

1045
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,180
如果你的立场和我不同...
If you're not with me...

1046
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,970
那你就是我的敌人
then you're my enemy.

1047
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:47,480
只有西斯的思维才这么极端
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1048
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:51,900
我得履行职责了
I will do what I must.

1049
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:54,980
你可以试试
You will try.

1050
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:30,770
陛下  我听说你有了个新徒弟
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1051
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:35,360
或许应该叫你达斯.西迪厄斯
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1052
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:38,060
尤达大师
Master Yoda.

1053
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,860
你没死
You survived.

1054
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,120
很惊讶么?
Surprised?

1055
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:47,410
傲慢蒙蔽了你  尤达大师
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1056
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,580
现在让你领教一下...
Now you will experience...

1057
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:54,170
黑暗原力的全部能量
the full power of the dark side.

1058
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:41,810
我等这一刻已经很久了...
I have waited a long time for this moment...

1059
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:47,100
我的绿色小朋友
my little green friend.

1060
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:00,780
终于  绝地武士终于一个不剩了
At last the Jedi are no more.

1061
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:05,120
只要我还活着就别说大话
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1062
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:12,790
你的统治就要结束了
At an end your rule is.

1063
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,130
它已经够长的了
And not short enough it was.

1064
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:24,100
如果你真的那么强大...
If so powerful you are...

1065
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:26,810
干吗要跑呢?
why leave?

1066
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:30,310
你阻止不了我的
You will not stop me.

1067
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:35,020
达斯.维德会比我们俩都要强大
Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.

1068
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:39,490
你高估了你的新徒弟
Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be.

1069
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:44,870
正如你高估了黑暗原力一样
As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.

1070
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:15,230
快点  时间要恰到好处
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1071
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:18,150
准备好了就发射你的归航信标
Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.

1072
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:20,610
没找到他的尸体  长官
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1073
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:24,360
- 那么他没死 - 再搜查一次
- Then he is not dead. - Double your search.

1074
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,740
好的  长官  马上就去
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1075
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,920
叫卡基船长去准备我的舰船立即起飞
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take-off.

1076
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:37,130
- 是的  主人 - 我感觉到维德勋爵有麻烦了
- Yes, Master. - I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1077
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,130
我不能再回来了
Into exile I must go.

1078
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,910
我失败了
