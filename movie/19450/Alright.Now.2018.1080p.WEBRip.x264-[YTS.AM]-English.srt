00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:56,708
She was an American.

159
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,876
She was American.

160
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,245
That woman who looks like you.

161
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,981
The woman who looks like me
was American.

162
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,115
Do you remember her name?

163
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,621
- Jill...
- Joanne Skye, yeah...

164
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,192
Is your name Joanne Skye?

165
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,696
Yes, it is. It is.

166
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,898
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

167
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,035
Sorry about that.

168
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,504
I was just kind of...

169
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,973
I was showing off to them.

170
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,674
Right.

171
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,510
Sorry, I liked them.

172
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,192
- You were good...
- Oh, you like them now?

173
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:33,879
I did yeah.

174
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,213
I'll tell you what, look.

175
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,815
I'll give you like a free slap,

176
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,517
and you have a go at me!

177
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,319
Whatever you want to say,
you have a go at me!

178
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:41,543
Those trainers are ridiculous!

179
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,427
Is there no reception in here?

180
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,929
Well there's no reception
anywhere around here?

181
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,098
Penderyn is not like...

182
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,901
phone familiar.

183
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,737
I'm trying to meet up
with a friend of mine.

184
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,704
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

185
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,674
I went to... I paid...
I bought a ticket.

186
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,516
- I thank you for that.
- I bought two tickets.

187
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Yeah.

188
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,879
I don't really drink much.

189
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,815
I'm sorry I had... I was just...

190
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,986
It seems like you've
had enough. Right?

191
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:15,988
Yeah.

192
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,993
Take that, ya pansy!

193
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,128
Alright, cheers, yeah.

194
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,864
Tada... with you.

195
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,709
Excuse me,
do you have a cigarette?

196
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,178
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

197
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,983
Hey!

198
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,987
Hey!

199
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:25,790
Ah, Jesus, Mary, mother

200
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,393
and Joseph, Oh God!

201
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,862
- I just...
- Oh, Baby!

202
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,331
- I tried calling you,
- That number doesn't work.

203
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah, your last number is not...

204
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,268
I've been trying to be in touch.

205
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,204
- And I flagged...
- I called you tonight,

206
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,273
I've been through two phones
and I've been...

207
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,175
- Why are you here?
- I didn't have your number.

208
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,343
- What are you doing here?
- I am not...

209
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,344
I'm here to see you.

210
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,278
I was looking for you.

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,147
I, needed to

212
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,715
stay with you for a few days.

213
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,417
Do you know where I live?

214
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,153
- I don't know where you live.
- OK, you wanna come...

215
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,355
You wanna come and meet Sharon?

216
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,957
[laughing]

217
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,194
- [Jo] That was a killer.
- [Sara] Oh, feel the burn.

218
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,665
- [Jo] Oh, my God! It's so cold.
- [Sara] This is Sharon.

219
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,702
- [Jo] You named your caravan?
- [Sara] Yeah.

220
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,544
- [Sara] Here we are, sister, carry on.
- [Jo] I just take this for now.

221
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,407
I'm not ready
to go to sleep after that

222
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,409
bike ride
in the freaking tundra.

223
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,777
That's what I'm saying.

224
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,444
What I'm saying is that

225
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,146
Larry is...

226
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,048
He does everything
and he is supposed to

227
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,916
communicate these things to me.

228
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,819
It doesn't matter how many times
he fucks around

229
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,221
or he fucks off
or whatever he does.

230
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:30,978
But his always
been straight with me.

231
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,994
And then I go off stage,
ready to celebrate.

232
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,096
Ready to get, you know,
a couple of drinks

233
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,231
and they are staring at me.

234
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,933
I don't want to know
where we're going

235
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,575
or where we're staying
I just want to know

236
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,432
if we're fucking
gonna stay together.

237
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,241
I smashed her guitar,
so It's over. It's the end.

238
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:56,981
Yeah, yeah, that's probably...
that's probably definitely true.

239
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,017
This is my fucking
life, you know.

240
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,453
I've been doing this
for 20 years, Sara.

241
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,754
I don't know...

242
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,490
[Jo] Fuck, I don't
know what to do.

243
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,826
Chin-chin! Chin-chin!

244
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,468
- Got another bottle?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Have some off this.

245
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:13,052
- The best news I've had all day!
- It's good news! Can you re...

246
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,840
- Are you kidding me?
- Can you imagine what it's like when it's a storm?

247
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,336
Why do you live in a caravan?

248
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,658
I don't think I ever
been in love.

249
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:21,072
I wasn't in love with Toby.

250
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,354
I don't know
if I ever felt love.

251
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,842
You were with Toby for like

252
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,376
- several years.
- A million years, I know.

253
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,078
What I'm thinking is that
what you need to do is...

254
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,880
You need to sort of think
about what's coming.

255
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,348
Because technically speaking

256
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,816
your trajectory,
traditionally...

257
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,418
Can't we just be here right now?

258
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,920
It will be suppression.
It will be depression.

259
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,223
So I think avoid it,
avoid it, avoid it.

260
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,357
Be clever.

261
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,393
I think you should just
do something else.

262
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,762
- Philosophy?
- No!

263
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,029
- Nursing?
- No!

264
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,331
- Vet work?
- No!

265
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,532
- Spanish?
- No!

266
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,134
- French?
- No!

267
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,070
- Marine biology?
- I like fish.

268
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,238
There is a lot of benefits.

269
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,305
People love to hang out

270
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,306
with marine biologists.

271
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,541
They are very cool

272
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,443
'cause they swim with dolphins.

273
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,346
Question: Why do you want to
go to Penderyn University?

274
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,481
- Because I like fish.
- This is gold.

275
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,450
- "Because I like fish."
- They have scales.

276
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,385
- Prawns are delicious.
- Prawns and krill.

277
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,020
I like them fried.

278
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,524
- Prawns fried...
- I like them also sautéed.

279
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,993
"I like them also sautéed."

280
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,075
- With garlic and butter.
- "With garlic and butter."

281
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:19,230
- Why not learn more about them?
- This is perfect.

282
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,065
OK, why not...
before I eat them.

283
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,167
"Before I eat them."

284
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,835
Before... This is gold.

285
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,437
Here is the thing.
It's all about just...

286
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,007
Just keeping your focus.

287
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,010
You always want to
keep your focus

288
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,079
and you never take
your eyes off the target.

289
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,548
[sighing] Yeah.

290
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,217
You never... You always
have that laser...

291
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,252
Like you've got laser
beams in your eyes.

292
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,321
You have these beams
and your just focused.

293
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,224
- You just never let it go.
- Yeah.

294

[Sara] Joanne!

303
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,049
- Hey!
- Are you...

304
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,331
Did you just run this whole way?

305
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,452
Yeah!

306
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,188
- That's cool.
- They're saying that...

Oh, my god! Are you

[laughing]

310
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:10,601
We basically passed all, all our
exams. We did all the tests.

311
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,738
- What are you... Our tests?
- Well you know your last night

312
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
you decided that you wanted
to go to university.

313
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,222
Don't you remember? You always
wanted to be a marine biologist.

314
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,144
That's what we did
last night. We applied.

315
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,986
- Because all the applications are coming in.
- How did I... I didn't...

316
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,417
- We did it all online.

00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,287
Yeah, a lot off men. A lot of posh men.
It came from you, Jo-Jo.

00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,422
They put you up in
a spot too, don't they?

And then everyone makes tea

What's with this?
What's with this outfit?

- Hello!
- [Pete] Hello.

336
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:40,291
Hi, my name is Sara Ramsey.
I'm so happy to be here.

337
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,061
And I'm just registering to
check that we're all signed up.

338
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,829
- What course?
- Marine biology.

339
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,365
- Marine biology.
- Ramsey?

340
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,367
No, the name is actually Joanne. Joanne
Skye. We registered late last night.

341
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,369
That's the name that you should have for
the person who is doing the course.

342
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:58,509
I did quite a lot of, you know,
work in the oceans etc.. etc..

343
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,279
- And deep sea diving.
- I haven't got a Joanne Skye.

344
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,361
I think you've got a mistake.
Definitely got a space.

345
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:06,451
I mean my... They commented
on my personal statement

346
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,653
- saying it was exceptional.
- Are you Joanne Skye?

347
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,456
I'm Jo... Well, I'm not Joanne
Skye. We did, she did...

348
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,391
Can you just check the Joanne's?

349
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,293

about five, six years ago.

352
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,715
You might know. I don't
know if it's your field,

353
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:24,917
but I came to this university.

354
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,105
So I'm that author.

355
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,673
OK, I just need
a name to register.

356
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,476
- Joanne Skye.
- I haven't got that name.

357
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:35,746
We are definitely accepted. We had this
section. We did an amazing section on silt.

358
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,684
In fact the person who responded and gave her
the place said that's what really swung it.

359
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:44,755
- So we definitely got a place.
- I haven't got access to that file. I just need a name.

360
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,458
- We're definitely in. What's your name?
- My name is Pete.

361
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,429
Pete, we're definitely inn, Pete. Would
you try again? Try Jo. Try JoAnn?

362
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:55,533
- There is a Joanne Jones.
- Joanne Jones is the name. Sorry, it's not Joanne Skye.

363
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,636
- Sorry, I made a mistake.
- Did you read that there then? Or did you not...

364
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,372
- How could I read that through the back of there?
- OK, Joanne.

365
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,307
- Right, I am...
- I don't want to come here

366
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,144
and be criminals. It's not
like we're just waltzing in.

I want to save the world.

368
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,548
- Just give me one second.
- Can you just confirm?

369

I was going... You are... to
see someone for a minute now.

You're doing a great job.

- I'm counting, 19, 20, 21.

00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:21,571
- Why are you doing the counting thing? What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

- It's your job.
- No!

Making bonds. Loving each other.

They didn't have a Pizza place When I
was here. You just had to, you know...

473
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,650
Did they even have... Do you remember
when they didn't even have pizzas

474
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,052
- that you could heat up?
- Yeah.

475
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,488
Do you remember that?
Like, before,

476
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,424
before you could get like ready
made pizzas to put in the oven?

477
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,692
Yeah, but where is everybody?

478
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,694
Seriously, what do we do?

479
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,816
Is there a rave or something?
Is there a rave tonight?

480
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:21,251
They don't do it anymore.
People don't take drugs anymore.

481
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:22,933
They all just,
kind of, get together

482
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,636
and grow beards and,
you know, write in notebooks.

483
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,738
Do you know what I mean?
They want to save the world.

484
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,540
They want to save
the world, boring.

485
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,142
They are all like this.
[chopping sounds]

486
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,129
Chopping up kale. Like that.

487
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,713
That's why they... Ugh! That hurts.
You can't sniff that shit.

488
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,715

It's been a long time for me.
That's my rave face.

491
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,061
I would just touch myself
for about an hour and a half.

492
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,338
Maybe that's why I'm meant to be here.
Because I'm meant to educate them.

493
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:57,034
- Yeah!
- We are women of experience.

494
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,770
Life experience,
sexual experience.

495
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,940
Teach them the fun of life. Do you know
what I mean? Let's just stay here.

496
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,811
Let's just have fun. Let's just, you
know, let's just get... Just get loose!

497
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:10,047
What do you do during freshman
week? Are they even around?

498
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,089
Isn't it supposed to be
something like a huge party?

499
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:14,785
- They do like bets and stuff.
- Let's do a bet.

500
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,886
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you and me.

501

Whoever has sex first

502
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,144
gets 50 quid.
That's what I think.

503
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,891
- Really!
- Yeah, that's why I bet.

504
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,626
50 quid. Oi!

Do you want to come to
a barbeque tonight?

511
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:36,774
Do you want to come
to a barbeque?

512
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,009
We're having a barbeque.

- [mouthing]
- On the beach.

514
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,782
On the beach with a barbeque.
Yeah, to the barbeque.

515
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,784
- [mouthing] - No, come
to the barbeque tonight.

He's cute! [Burps]

- Hey!

519
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,960
[Jo] Hi, so you're
coming tonight?

520
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,498
- Barbeque.
- We'll see you tonight at the barbeque.

521
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,767
- Oh, yeah, the barbeque.
- Yeah!

522
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,803
- Yeah!
- You don't have to come if you don't want to. It's fine.

523
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,125
- Don't feel any pressure.
- You should come. It'll be fun.

524
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:10,841
There is going to be a whole bunch
of us flat mates and what not.

525
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,843
Do you have any friends
that you can bring as well?

526
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,325
- Sexually active male friends.
- Sexually active male friends.

527
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,814
Yeah, I got some, yeah.

528
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,016
Any who might want to have
sexually intercourse with me?

529
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,652
- Yeah, do you have any of those kind of friends?
- Yeah.

530
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,621
- OK, great.
- Yeah, that's good.

531
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,983
You could bring some of those.
Yeah, you could just bring...

532
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,910
You could come. And then you can
bring some of your friends.

533
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:29,193
A lot of your male friends

534
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,895
so we could just kind of
go through

535
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:34,798
and go: Yeah, no,
yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

536
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,702
No! So we could just have
a lot of options, really.

537
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,604
Do you like beards?

538
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,539
[Sara] I don't mind beards.

539
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,107
I enjoy a beard.

540
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,242
- [Pete] OK.
- Beards kind of works for me.

541
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,544
Yeah!

542
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:51,115
I've got lady friends as well.

543
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,284
[Jo] No, we don't need you
to bring them, though.

544
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,852
I can't bring them.
Don't bring...

545
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,787
I have done barbeques before.

546
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:00,024
When I did it, we just had
wood and kind of lit it.

547
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,626
And kind of... sometime
you get a potato

548
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:06,096
and you put it in the foil. Put it
in so it's cooking all the time.

549
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,567
'Cause it cooks slower than
the sausages and stuff.

550
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,936
And then people...
Maybe salads as well?

551
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,972
- Yeah.
- [Jo] Just bring some sexually active friends tonight.

552
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,708
We're ready. We're
getting... we're down to F.

553
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,710
So, are we done here?

554
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,615
- Yeah, we'll see you tonight.
- Yeah, OK. Ciao then!

555
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,117
- Do you want a pizza?
- Good to get to see you, Pete. We keep running into each other.

556
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,153
Do you want pizza?
We didn't ask if he wanted to...

557
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,655
We're gonna get laid tonight!

558
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,591
- Which people...
- And I'm gonna do it first.

559
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,060
- I'm up with that.
- We can do that.

560
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,662
The bet is on! What, so,
we technically speaking,

561
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,765
- like what is it exactly...
- First penis in your body gets 50 quid.

562
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,527
In the body? Not just
seeing and touching it?

00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,735

567
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,865
[Jo] I just want to dip my toes.

568
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,947
- [Pete] That's not a good idea.
- [Jo] It's not bad!

00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:20,971
[Pete] I'm not doing that.

570
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,333
[Pete] I might
mess my trainers up.

571

[Jo] No, come in with me.

- [Jo] Why not?

- [Pete] What?
- [Jo] Go for a little swim.

[Jo] It's not so bad,
we've got towels.

[Pete] I haven't got a towel.

- [Pete] What?
- [Jo] I'm just wondering about you.

577

- [Pete] About me?
- [Jo] Yeah, I'm wondering.

578
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,573
[Jo] I don't know. I can't
quite figure you out.

579
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,995
[Pete] There's not much
to figure out, really.

Just kind of... Me.

- Well, it's great.

it's really, really good.

along. Let's move out of here.

779
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:12,555
This was a really good
talk, little bird.

780
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,927
We are planning actually
a flat 8 party.

781
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,896
- Right here.
- What does that mean?

782
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,564
There's gonna be
a party right here.

783
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,033
- It's gonna be off the...
- In here?

784
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:24,534
Yeah!

785
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,603
You need me!

786
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,873
This is what I do.

787
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,541
Drugs and alcohol.

788
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,976
We're gonna kick it!

789
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,944
We're gonna kick it up a notch.

790
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,047
Flat eight!

791
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,048
Flat eight.

792
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,049
Flat eight.

793
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:40,850
Flat eight. Cheerio!

I'm gonna get on you. I'm gonna
go all the way to the top.

You can't just jump on

- Yeah, I think, I did yeah.
- Fuck!

822
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,126
I really held back too.
If I would have gone

823
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,529
full force. You would not have
been able to have children.

- You can't...
- I don't want the full force.

- Hey, listen.
- I don't want full force.

It's like that. Sorry.

get you some breakfast.

How we do the... Argh! Look.

Sorry I didn't say good bye last night.
You were kind of... sleeping.

834
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,660
That was a god story.
I had a great night sleep.

Let's do it.

840
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,976
- Thanks for lunch.
- It's alright.

- But thank you, cheers!
- It's alright.

843
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,524
Do you know that quote from
that... from<i> Cool Hand Luke</i>?

844
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:38,194
You know when he's on his horse
and he goes: "Hi, Sunny",

845
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,630
how many eggs can you eat? 50?"

846
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,632
- 50 eggs.
- Isn't he in jail?

847
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:44,834
- He's in jail.
- Cool Hand Luke is in jail.

848
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,504
- He's not on a horse.
- Well, his on a horse at some point

849
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,138
in the movie. It's a western.

850
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,642
Anyway, how many eggs
could you eat? 50 eggs?

851
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,110
- 50 eggs?
- Could you eat 50 eggs?

852
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,646
- Could you eat 50 eggs?
- How long over?

853
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,281
A minute.

854
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,516
A minute?

855
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,687
Two? Confidently two, 'cause
it gets dry. Watch now.

856
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,555
Go on, go!

857
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,623
Go!

858
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:11,160
Alright.

859
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,829
That's 12 seconds gone.

860
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,938
- Dry now, isn't it?
- It's bad.

861
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,301
I like your coat.

862
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:20,303
- Thanks.
- Very 90's.

863
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:22,272
It is really 90's!

864
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,908
Do you know I was in
a band in the 90's?

865
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,309
No, were you? I didn't know.

866
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,044
You don't even
mentioned it, either.

867
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,979
No, I haven't brought it up yet.

868
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,781
I know I haven't mentioned it.

869
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,917
I would never start
a conversation with somebody

870
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,753
mentioning their credibility.

871
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,721
[Jo laughs]

872
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,257
There is some good things
that came out of the 90's.

873
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,158
There are, yeah.

874
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,893
Like you.

875
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,636
Were you a fan of Britpop?

876
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,204
Yeah! Massive.

877
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,307
- Really?
- Yeah, I really liked it.

878
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:59,042
I've always liked the 90's.

879
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,777
I don't know. There's
this... I'm obviously,

880
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,111
I'm obviously nostalgic.

881
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:04,908
- But I think it was the best decade.
- Best music.

882
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,590
Which was the Britpop
I mean Britpop was...

883
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:10,186
I remember when I was living...
I was living in Seattle.

884
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,955
So much of it was about grunge.

885
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:15,358
- You know, so dark and it was so...
- Grungy.

886
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,695
Yeah, the music that
was happening over here

887
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,863
was just poppy and fun and...

888
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,600
That's why I ended up over here.

889
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:24,934
My mother is British.

890
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,869
So I got my
citizenship from her.

891
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,006
So, where does
your mum live now?

892
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,040
Oh, no she's deed.

893
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,913
- It's OK. No, it's OK!
- Sorry.

894
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:39,616
No, it's fine.
She died when I was 16.

895
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,117
She died a long time ago.

896
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,019
It's fine. Yeah.

897
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,821
- Thanks for bringing it up.
- Yeah.

898
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,725
My dad died...

899
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:51,861
a couple of years ago.

900
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,098
So I know how it feels.

901
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:04,173
So, I can know what
you're talking about, so.

902
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:09,012
I get it. I get that.
To me it's kind of... Ahem.

903
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:12,649
It probably must have been even
harder for you. Younger age.

904
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,851
Yeah, I mean it was
a long time ago though, so.

905
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,721
Yeah, but still.
It's hard, you know.

906
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:19,856
You know.

907
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,359
Thanks. Here we are.

908
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,763
I didn't... Yeah, right. Fine.

909
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,731
I'll throw them back, mate.

910
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,170
Begetted! Begotten!

911
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,040
- Reddy for this?
- Don't.

912
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,074
Cool Hand Luke.

913
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,109
Oh! We missed it.

914
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:48,951
- Are you living with parents or guardians? No!
- No! Although it feels that way.

915
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:52,855
- I woke up this morning and Sara was like this.
- Yeah.

916
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,259
- She was breathing right in my ear.
- Right.

917
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:59,862
- It was terrible.
- Yeah.

918
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,297
- There you are.
- Hi!

919
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,999
I've been looking
for you all day.

920
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:04,641
I've been everywhere.
I've been down to...

921
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:06,069
Right down to the bottom,

922
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,071
down to Coofi. I don't know
what that is, the café?

923
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:09,273
Why can't you just say coffee.

924
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:10,406
Where have you been?

925
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,408
I've been here just
filling out some forms

926
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,844
for a hardship fund.

927
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,313
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- 'Cause you were sleeping.

928
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,465
But I thought we were
going to do all that.

929
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:24,053
- This hardship fund.
- Hiya.

930
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,788
- Yeah.
- Hi.

931
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,824
He's helping me. Remember
Pete from last night?

932
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:29,892
- OK, yeah, I remember him.
- Sara.

933
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:33,096
- So, you have been filling out forms, Have you?
- Stop that.

934
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,965
I don't know. I mean, you know.

935
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,967
I'm filling out. Pete is
helping me, he works here.

936
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,837
Did you [whistles] as you
planned. Did you do the bet?

937
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,138
How was he?

938
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,073
- Very sweet.
- Is he very sweet?

939
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,743
- He's sweet and he's kind.
- Is this some part of the bet?

940
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:50,246
Did you do the bet? I did the bet. I did
the bet. And it was like a competition.

941
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,968
- There wasn't a bet. It was.
- I'm still...

942
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,690
- conversation about...
- I can barely walk.

943
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:55,218
But I did it. I took
one for the team.

944
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,019
How are you, Pete?
How did it go?

945
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,755
- I don't know...
- What was the bet?

946
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,824
- It wasn't a...
- Sweet and sad.

947
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,327
I just gotta go back to work.
Give me the forms now.

948
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:08,197
- Who could have sex first [unintelligible].
- Pete, it wasn't...

949
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,434
- It was me. I won, so...
- Just... why would you do that?

950
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,236
- He's a nice guy.
- So!

951
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:15,438
Did you see how he dressed?
He dressed all 90's.

952
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,201
- He's trying to be cool for me.
- Do you think he's in love with you?

953
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:20,923
- Is that what you're saying?
- I don't know if he's in love with me,

954
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,044
but he's being nice to me.

955
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:24,886
I had everything planed. We were gonna
come and sort out all your stuff.

956
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,317
And then, you know, maybe
sign up for the gym.

957
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,820
And then go and get
a baked potato or something.

958
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:32,989
But I don't want to
fall out with you about it.

959
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,511
I'm fine. Listen, we are fine.
Listen, we are fine. We are fine.

960
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:37,527
- And I'm sorry I left you today.
- Just don't...

961
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:39,896
- Don't leave me.
- I know but you get...

962
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,798
- You know.
- Let's go and get a drink.

963
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,000
- OK, let's get a drink.
- I bet you,

964
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,763
- I bet you...
- I do need a drink. I need a drink. I deserve a drink.

965
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:49,338
That we can get...
That I can get six people

966
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,507
to buy me a drink
before you can.

967
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,910
- [Sara] Before I can?
- [Jo] Free drinks.

Hey!

980
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,509
Hi!

981
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,344
We meet again!

982
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,347
Actually I did try and request
Facebook friendship.

983
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,617
I thought you were busy
making love with one of the...

984
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,486
- With Steven.
- Yeah, with one of the Stevens.

985
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:38,855
Yeah, I was totally.

986
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:39,889
And you were clearly busy

987
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:41,357
as well with Hannah.

988
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,993
Sara and I we were just...
It was so silly.

989
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:47,163
And it didn't...
It wasn't what it was.

990
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,605
- Have a beer, Hannah. Come on.
- It's OK, I don't drink beer.

991
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:51,300
- Don't be...
- She doesn't like carbs.

992
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:53,035
Come on, have a little beer.

993
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,997
- I have this...
- I was like a joke, competition.

994
00:47:55,021 --> 00:47:56,061
- [Sara] I won!
- No, what?

995
00:47:56,085 --> 00:47:57,618
- I won!
- You won?

996
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,410
I won! We're gonna be shagging

997
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:02,411
all night tonight.

998
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,980
So you have to find

999
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:05,581
somewhere else to stay!

1000
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,017
So. [Making funny sounds]

1001
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,123
We're gonna get loud!

1002
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,458
We're gonna get loud!

1003
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,059
So you gotta find
somewhere to stay!

1004
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,494
[making funny noises]

1005
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:25,101
And you have to find
somewhere else to stay!

1006
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,103
You gotta sleep
on another couch.

1007
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:29,505
We're gonna ride it, ride it.

1008
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,908
Ride it like a cowboy,
like John Wayne.

1009
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,542
Ride it like a cowboy,
like John Wayne.

1010
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,044
That's right, babe.

1011
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,445
[making funny noises]

1012
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:41,150
He's... This is big for him.

1013
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:42,551
This is big for him.

1014
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:45,955
Rata, ratata!
You know! You know!

1015
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,189
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

1016
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,158
- Great.
- So, I won!

1017
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,093
You lost, I won.

1018
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,430
You lot are gonna go downtown.

1019
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,632
- Sweet, isn't he?
- He's a good guy.

1020
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,935
I was mean to him earlier.
He's so...

1021
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:00,657
I don't think he knows
what to do with that.

1022
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:02,104
[making funny sounds]

1023
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,206
Hang on. Yeah,
I'm gonna go and sit down now.

1024
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,408
- Pick me up!
- Ouch!

1025
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,143
- Hip, hip!
- Yeah, brilliant.

1026
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:09,312
- Riding me.
- Come on, Petey!

1027
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,147
- Yeah.
- Take me home, Petey!

1028
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:14,417
- You put your feet on the floor.
- Oh, there she goes!

1029
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,139
- There she goes, yeah.
- Look at that butt!

1030
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:18,020
Let me see that!

1031
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,289
He's a beast.
He's a sneaky beast.

1032
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,591
And you don't know it.
I'll find out tonight.

1033
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,428

- I fucking fell on my ass.

00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,634
She needs to get into
the real world at the moment.

1049
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,236
[crosstalking] - Whatever.
- Stop it!

1050
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:08,237
- I'm looking after her.
- Stop! Stop!

Go away!

1055
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:22,385
And you're a sad registrar.
I don't even know you!

1056
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,353
- I've known you for like three days.
- I'm gone. OK, gone.

1057
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,636
OK, see you later! I don't need
taking care off. Ok? So...

1058
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,090
Have a drink of water,
though, Jo.

Do you want another drink?

1062
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,099
I think I probably
had enough, actually.

1063
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,301
[Jo] You did this to me.

1064
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,703
You wanted to...

1065
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,338
What...

1066
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,340
[Jo] Wow!

1067
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,576
Larry!

1068
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,478
- Yes.
- Stop it.

You're such a fucking prick.

[Jo] Let's get out of here.

1071

[Jo] Let's go!

1072

- [Larry] I miss you.
- Why did you do that?

1073
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,206
[Olivia] Are they together?

1074
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,427
No, they were broken up

1075
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,262
and it's really bad news.

1076
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,631
- Hey.
- Hi, guys!

1077
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:09,765
Hello!

1078
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,233
Hello!

1079
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,435
Hello.

1080
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:13,469
Hello.

1081
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:14,470
- Hey.
- Hey!

1082
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,072
Hey, hello, ma'am!

1083
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,607
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no chicken nuggets.

1084
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,143
I don't need chicken nuggets.
I got chicken breast.

1085
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:25,081
You got two chicken... Some ripe
chicken breast right here.

1086
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:29,718
You know what, baby, I want to see
you strip. I missed you so much.

1087
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,454
- I want the whole thing.
- The whole thing?

00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:15,684
but I really would like to
try the States, I think.

1244
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:17,853
So Hawaii with your family?

1245
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:21,290
- My dad.
- Yeah?

1246
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,959
Yeah, my dad lives
outside of Seattle.

1247
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:24,961
OK.

1248
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,763
He's still around,
kicking around.

1249
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,253
Must be hard to be
here with him there.

1250
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,235
We're not close.

1251
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,296
You should do something
about that, I think.

1252
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:42,744
It's not... 'Cause, you know...

1253
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:45,914
You shouldn't regret it.

1254
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,084
Don't regret stuff like that.

1255
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,025
He has been calling
me a lot lately.

1256
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,927
I don't know what...
Seems like he's trying

1257
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,162
to track me down.

1258
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,099
But he's a great guy.
He's a nice guy.

1259
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,634
He's...

1260
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:06,935
You should call him.

1261
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,807
Uhm.

1262
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:12,809
No, really you should.

1263
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,614
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

1264
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,082
- I should.
- Call him.

1265
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:22,317
I wish I could call
my dad, and I can't.

1266
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,652
So...

1267
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,448
Maybe you should...
Just don't let it...

1268
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,324
It's not good.

1269
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,394
It's not good to leave things.

1270
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,200
Clear kind of... It's
a good time for you

1271
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:39,768
to just clear everything up.

1272
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:41,704
Yeah.

1273
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,306
[sighs]

1274
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,041
Yeah, you're right, I think.

1275
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:52,314
I have somethings
I need to figure out.

1276
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,216
One of them being Larry.

1277
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:55,917
Not him. Don't phone him.

1278
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,786
Well, I'm not gonna...

1279
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,056
Just, you know,
about the band and...

1280
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:04,359
Just some things
I need to put to bed.

1281
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,927
Yeah. OK.

1282
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:08,964
Do you want me to take that?

1283
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,899
- Oh!
- You want that gone.

1284
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:14,002
Thank you, sir.

1285
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,804
Thank you. Nice.

1286
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:18,974
What a kind sir. What a
kind British man you are.

1287
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,913
Hit it. No, we're just playing

1288
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,214
pass in a small corridor.

1289
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:28,450
That's what I call
a light breaker.

1290
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,085
Watch yourself now.

1291
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:31,186
Alright!

1292
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,288
- I can't help it.
- See it.

1293
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,612
You're not really meant to play
ball games in the corridor.

1294
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:40,429
- Sorry It's been...
- Oh, they're fine.

1295
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,764
Hey, we need your help.

1296
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,326
We're try... You're
not gonna like this.

1297
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:45,728
We're trying to
organize this party.

1298
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:47,035
We don't have a DJ.

1299
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,704
We don't have a theme.

1300
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:50,466
Don't listen to her.
We've got loads of CD's.

1301
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:51,840
That takes the theme.

1302
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:52,774
- It's not a theme.
- We have got music.

1303
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:53,775
We've got food.

1304
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:55,944
What about a 90's party?

1305
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,212
A 90's theme party.

1306
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:58,947
- Great.
- I was born in the 90's.

1307
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,789
We were born then. We
don't really remember it.

1308
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:01,790
- Let's bring it back.
- That's more fun.

1309
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,151
Oasis, smiley faces,

1310
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:04,920
- Garage bands.
- It's fun.

1311
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:07,189
Lots of drugs. Raves were
happening back then.

1312
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,458
And they were awesome.
And you have me!

1313
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,326
- Uh, yeah.
- So!

1314
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:14,029
She's been around.
She knows how to do this.

1315
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:15,063
She's been around.

1316
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,298
That is a good thing.

1317
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,833
- She's on board.
- I'm on board.

1318
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:19,195
- We have two on board.
- I know...

1319
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:20,397
We just need a third on board

1320
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:22,304
and we can kick this up a notch.

1321
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:24,039
It's the greatest
decade of all time.

1322
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,308
I mean you know.
You were wearing the vintage.

1323
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,776
Union Jack.

1324
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,878
- It's ironic.
- Geri Halliwell.

1325
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,379
Geri, Spice Girls. There you go.

1326
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,116
There is you're costume.
We've got Blondie Spice.

1327
01:02:34,118 --> 01:02:36,284
And Princess Spice.
Fruit Loop Spice.

1328
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:39,254
- And Honey Bread Spice.
- Pretty Spice.

1329
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,156
Hot Spice.

1330
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:43,191
There you go. This is the
Spice Girls right here.

1331
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:45,273
We could literary be the
Spice Girls if we wanted to.

1332
01:02:45,297 --> 01:02:49,097
This is going to be the
greatest night of your life.

1333
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,265
- He'll be there.
- Yeah!

1334
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,333
- I'll be there.
- Yeah!

1335
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:53,135
Come on! She'll be there.

1336
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:55,904
Come on! It'll be so much fun.

1337
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:58,039
- Thank you!
- I'm gonna get working

1338
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,174
on my costume.

1339
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:00,776
- Thanks.
- Get planning.

1340
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:01,877
It's gonna be off the hook.

1341
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,278
I might sing a song!

1342
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,416
- Pretty Spice, huh?
- Things just come out sometimes.

1343
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:09,985
- You know because that's...
- Hello.

1344
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,119
- Hey!
- Hi!

1345
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,554
- How is it going?
- Fine.

1346
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:13,836
Just playing
a little... keep up.

1347
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,824
One, two, tree, four.

1348
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:18,126
Just been to your induction.

1349
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,796
- To my induction?
- You should have been there, in fact.

1350
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,264
Shouldn't you be working?
What do you actually do?

1351
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:24,199
Do you just prowl around
halls of residence?

1352
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,967
- Keep substance.
- Is that what you do?

1353
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,036
Eating cheese sandwiches.
Is that what you do?

1354
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,438
- I haven't had a cheese sandwich.
- What are you doing here?

1355
01:03:30,462 --> 01:03:32,073
We're just having
a little bit of fun.

1356
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,475
You don't have to come in here

1357
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,310
and act this way
in front of Peter.

1358
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,045
How about I decide
what I wanna do?

1359
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,547
Why don't I make the decisions?

1360
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:39,915
My plan is to be here

1361
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,316
to support you as your friend.

1362
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,718
The point is that
you got to enroll.

1363
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,719
You are also not my mother.

1364
01:03:43,721 --> 01:03:44,886
You also don't have

1365
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:45,821
to boss me around.

1366
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:46,955
So, Yeah.

1367
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,256
I'm just here to have fun.

1368
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:49,224
And I don't really give a fuck

1369
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:50,091
about what classes

1370
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:51,359
I'm doing.

1371
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,961
Ok, that's not a good attitude.

1372
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:54,062
If you are not careful,

1373
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,230
that attitude

1374
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,398
is gonna get you thrown out.

1375
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,834
Don't raise your voice to me!

1376
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,375
Are you done?

1377
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,579
Yeah, I'm fine,
I'm completely fine.

1378
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:15,250
Let me get changed. And we'll
go out and get a drink, OK?

1379
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,286
Yeah, I don't make out
that I'm the needy one.

1380
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,188
I'm just like, I'm
hanging out. I'm fine.

1381
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:26,461
- Pete, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, It's alright. Ciao.

1382
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,402
- My coat's just in here.
- Oh is it? OK, yeah.

I'm a master of tea, okay?

1395
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:55,417
- Of course.
- I'm just gonna make

1396
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:57,285
you the best tea of
your goddamn life.

1397
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,386
So sit down

1398
01:05:58,388 --> 01:05:59,354

talk to you soon.

1717
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:27,421
Alright?

1718
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:28,923
<i>- OK, honey.</i>
- OK.

1719
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:31,525
<i>- Bye, Jo.</i>
- Bye.

1720
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,496
[skype switches off]

1721
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,953
If I had a boob job,
and you had two choices,

1722
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:00,955
judging from what you're
seeing, it's that or that.

1723
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:03,397
- Which one would you go for?
- Could I go for them like that?

1724
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:04,799
So, one like that
and one like that.

1725
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:06,093
- OK!
- Brilliant.

1726
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:08,529
In the meantime I'm
gonna give you...

1727
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:11,899
Oh, my god! You never
looked more beautiful.

1728
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:14,468
My balloon. Oh, my God.
This is the one.

1729
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,004
Do you think that balloons are a
specifically 90's phenomenon?

1730
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:19,086
Do you think? Do you feel that?
I mean, I'm not sure.

1731
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,941
They are just balloons.

1732
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:22,409
I'm sick of all those girls

1733
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:24,445
saying they were born
in 19 fucking 97.

1734
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:26,313
- Who the fuck would even mention...
- Like, who gives a shit?

1735
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:28,635
- It's not even possible.
- Do you know? It's not possible.

1736
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:30,284
I mean, I don't remember
the 90's either.

1737
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:31,585
For different reasons.

1738
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:36,357
90's. Everything above
the 80's a liar.

1739
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:38,192
Hey, Jo!

1740
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:41,896
- Jo! Oh, Jo. Come on.
- No, no, no!

1741
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:43,538
- No, no.
- What are you doing over there?

1742
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,033
Hey! I'm gonna talk to her.

1743
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:47,167
Hey!

1744
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,510
[ Friend] What's up?
What's going on?

1745
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:51,639
Nothing.

1746
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:55,542
As long as you don't
throw them in the face.

1747
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:57,344
No, this is what
we want to avoid.

1748
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:58,379
We don't want this.

1749
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:00,865
I'm not in the mood for
balloons right now, you guys.

1750
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:03,350
- Not in the mood for balloons?
- I'm not really feeling it.

1751
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:04,652
Come on, kid.

1752
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:07,288
You know... Come on!

1753
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,455
You know you've did

1754
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:09,657
something wrong when you go...

1755
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:13,394
When you don't find
balloons funny.

1756
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:15,930
Come on, miss, you
know this is like a...

1757
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:18,432
- No?
- No.

1758
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,000
Where is Pete?
Is Pete not around?

1759
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:21,242
Where is he, is he coming down?

1760
01:22:21,244 --> 01:22:22,209
I don't know where Pete is.

1761
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:24,438
Pete has run away.

1762
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,640
- He's run away?
- Because the big bad wolf

1763
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:28,375
has scared him off.

1764
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:30,711
- You came on too strong?
- Shocker!

1765
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:32,212
Right?

1766
01:22:32,214 --> 01:22:33,547
That is... Wow!

1767
01:22:33,549 --> 01:22:35,015
Seriously?

1768
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,119
When you say that,
what do you mean, like?

1769
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,121
It's something that we're
like sexually compatible.

1770
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:43,123
I don't think it's the thing.
I mean, you know him.

1771
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:44,591
I do. Kind of like...

1772
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:47,962
He's probably just a bit,
a little bit terrified

1773
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:48,964
of...

1774
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,465
stuff.

1775
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,901
I feel like things were going
really well, and then he...

1776
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,336
- What did you say?
- Well, I tried something

1777
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,099
I thought he would like
and he didn't like it

1778
01:22:58,101 --> 01:22:58,800
and he freaked out.

1779
01:22:58,802 --> 01:22:59,707
And I can't...

1780
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:01,342
I haven't seen him.

1781
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:05,279
- What did you try?
- What did you try?

1782
01:23:05,281 --> 01:23:08,549
We went in the room, and there
was two other people in there.

1783
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,718
Steve and Mandy.

1784
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,486
- OK.
- And so I thought...

1785
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:14,688
Yeah, first date.

1786
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,156
Why not? You know.

1787
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,025
- And he...
- Why not?

1788
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:23,063
He just kind of freaked out. And I
think it was a little bit too much.

1789
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:25,099
Listen, I tried everything.
It's fine, it's fine.

1790
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:26,901
He's gonna do his thing.
He's gonna stay here.

1791
01:23:26,925 --> 01:23:28,769
I'm gonna go off.
I'm gonna go home, so.

1792
01:23:28,771 --> 01:23:31,091
- Are you going back to the US?
- I'm going back to the US.

1793
01:23:31,093 --> 01:23:33,533
I'm not even gonna be... You know,
I'm not even gonna see him.

1794
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:35,609
It's fine. I'm gonna go...
I'm going to America.

1795
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,111
- Are you?
- I'm gonna see my dad.

1796
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:38,178
- Are you?
- Yeah, yeah.

1797
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,380
Have you spoken to him?

1798
01:23:39,382 --> 01:23:40,581
Yeah, I had

1799
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,116
a really lovely Skype with him.

1800
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:43,678
- Did you?
- So I'm gonna go back and...

1801
01:23:43,702 --> 01:23:46,754
I'm not gonna try and do this
all the way from America.

1802
01:23:46,756 --> 01:23:51,258
So, it's fine. We just go our
separate ways. It's fine.

1803
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,427
OK, well, I mean, you know,

1804
01:23:53,429 --> 01:23:54,789
you seem to have it all
wrapped up.

1805
01:23:54,813 --> 01:23:56,263
And worked out, which is great.

1806
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:57,945
- I'm out.
- Yeah, I mean he's just like...

1807
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:00,601
nothing, just a...

1808
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:03,203
Just a kind of
foursome gone wrong.

1809
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,139
Ultimately that's
what it is, right?

1810
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,041
Sure.

1811
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:08,475
You know.

1812
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:11,311
OK, this is a good quote:

1813
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,515
You know.
And maybe it applies to you.

1814
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:15,816
Maybe it relates to you.

1815
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,485
That, you know. You... If...

1816
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,287
You're unhappy

1817
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:22,556
if you're a tortoise
trying to be a hare.

1818
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,191
But you're also unhappy

1819
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:28,362
if you're a hare trying
to be a tortoise.

1820
01:24:29,331 --> 01:24:32,433
- So you're saying that...
- Do you know what I mean?

1821
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:36,203
You may not be a tortoise.

1822
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:37,204
You may have been a hare.

1823
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:38,105
You may want to

1824
01:24:38,107 --> 01:24:39,139
be a tortoise.

1825
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,341
You may now be both.

1826
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:42,743
You may want to
switch and change.

1827
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:47,681
Maybe you want
a foursome, maybe, with

1828
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,349
a squirrel and a badger.

1829
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:50,818
You know. Maybe

1830
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,553
the tortoise doesn't like

1831
01:24:52,555 --> 01:24:54,588
squirrels and badgers
and only likes hares.

1832
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:57,624
That's what I'm saying.

1833
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,126
Let him know.

1834
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:00,661
Let him know. Let him know!

1835
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:03,197
This is what happens, you know.

1836
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,700
It's magic! Life is magic!
Go and get Pete.

1837
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:08,222
Just invite him to
say goodbye tonight.

1838
01:25:08,246 --> 01:25:09,636
Just go and tell him.

1839
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:12,272
Just go and convey
to him how you feel.

1840
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,074
And get him to come down
just for the evening.

1841
01:25:14,098 --> 01:25:15,242
Just to say goodbye.

1842
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:16,276
So you're saying
that I should go

1843
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,377
and say goodbye to Pete?

1844
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:18,545
- You're right.
- OK.

1845
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:19,713
I need to see this through.

1846
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:21,615
I love you, Jo.

1847
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:25,219
I love you.

1848
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:27,121
Let him know that's
how you feel.

[Tara] Girls, it's gonna be so much fun.
[Mandy] Yeah, what're you doing?

1852
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:33,687
[Tara] I'm just sexing up my dress a little
bit. It's not very Geri Halliwell, yeah.

1853
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:36,609
- [Susie] You got the curve.
- [Tara] But it will be if I make it a bit more...

1854
01:26:36,611 --> 01:26:39,651
- [Tara] a bit more slinky, a bit more cute.
- [Mandy] Are you wearing a wig?

1855
01:26:39,675 --> 01:26:42,835
- [Tara] You'll see, you'll see.
- [Susie] Did she have long hair or short hair?

1856
01:26:42,859 --> 01:26:44,331
[Susie] I can't remember. Short?

1857
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,532
Oh well, I don't know
because I'm Brown.

1858
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:46,967
I hope you've been doing

Who are you gonna look like?

This is it. This is me.

Do you want me to
do your make up?

1865
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:57,544
Done. Just did it.

This is my make-up.
