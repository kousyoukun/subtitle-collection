1
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,366
<i>Yep, that's me. Kronk.</i>

2
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,088
<i>Wait. Where did I go?</i>

3
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:42,653
<i>Right, there I am.</i>

4
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:45,093
<i>Covered in cheese</i>
<i>like a human pizza.</i>

5
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:47,096
<i>My life was fine until today.</i>

6
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:50,343
<i>- But now I'm doomed. Doomed!</i>
- Ah!

7
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,897
<i>You know, it wasn't</i>
<i>always like this.</i>

8
00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:56,169
<i>I helped save the emperor's life.</i>
<i>Found a rewarding career.</i>

9
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,802
<i>Next slide!</i>

10
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,005
<i>I even made</i>
<i>some great new friends.</i>

11
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:03,844
<i>Oh! But look at me now!</i>
<i>Hiding out like a frightened kid</i>

12
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,910
<i>who needs a hug</i>
<i>from his teddy bear.</i>

13
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,479
<i>The little yellow one</i>
<i>with the button nose.</i>

14
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,819
<i>Ah, if only I could</i>
<i>turn back the clock.</i>

15
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,688
<i>Back to a time when I had</i>
<i>a spring in my step</i>

16
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:17,140
<i>and a... smile in my heart.</i>

17
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,609
<i>A time I like to think of as...</i>

18
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,882
<i>...earlier that same day.</i>

19
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:34,827
Ahhh!

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,039
Mmm!

21
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,243
Mmm!

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,419
<i>Come on!</i>

23
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,922
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

24
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:05,881
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

25
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,775
<i>Look out! Here it comes!</i>

26
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,528
So right about now you're probably
wondering,

27
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,695
"Hey, where's that emperor guy?"

28
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:39,066
Ha-ha! Wella, wella, boom baby!

29
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,835
Emperor Kuzco here,
coming at you live from the palace.

30
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:44,170
Hail Kuzco!

31
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,709
No, please, don't grovel.
I'd feel stupid.

32
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,508
I'm not that kind of guy anymore.

33
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,676
I'm nice now.
Didn't you see the first movie?

34
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,514
Yay! A 50-foot me!

35
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:57,331
Oh, I love that movie, 'cause it's all
about me.

36
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:03,557
But right now it's Kronk's turn
to be in the limelight.

37
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,623
Let me put this as simply as I can.

38
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,691
This one's his movie.

39
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,260
Not my movie. His movie.

40
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,269
Not mine. His, not mine.

41
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:14,770
His. Not mine. You got it?

42
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,070
Even the little ones? OK.

43
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,939
I'll be back to check on you later.

44
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,208
Have some popcorn,
a little sippy-sip of your sip stuff.

45
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:25,696
Places, please. Action!

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Ordering!

47
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:33,351
Waffle platter, extra butter,
two honey-glazed pill bugs

48
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:36,155
and a chocolate sundae, hold the cherry.

49
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,160
One diet plate. Got it.

50
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,894
<i>Yeah, it was shaping up</i>
<i>to be another perfect day.</i>

51
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:45,665
<i>The orders were flying, the joint</i>
<i>was jumping, grease was popping...</i>

52
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,501
<i>...and everybody knew my name.</i>

53
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,801
Kronk!

54
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,371
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I was living the dream.</i>

55
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,409
Hey, Kronk!
How about some grub?

56
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,208
- Pacha!
- Hey, Kronk!

57
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:56,489
Tipo. Chaca.

58
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,558
Put her there, Junior Chipmunks.

59
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,315
Nice handshake, Chippers!

60
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,498
- Mmm. Someone's been practicing.
- Oh! You're too kind.

61
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,257
Pacha, you forgot your change yesterday.

62
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,591
Hey, thanks, Kronk!

63
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:14,062
Well, what's right is right.
Otherwise...

64
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,581
- It'd be wrong!
- Right.

65
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,167
Boy, the place is packed.

66
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:22,536
Yeah. Never had this many friends
when I was an evil henchman.

67
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,237
And look at you now, chef at Mudka's.

68
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,608
And head delivery boy!

69
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,844
<i>Delivery Boy logo by permission</i>
<i>of Delivery Boy Local 8675309.</i>

70
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:35,351
- I get my one-year pin next week.
- That calls for a celebration!

71
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,116
A toast to Kronk!

72
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,183
May you be this happy

73
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,107
till the day you die!

74
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:43,943
Ah!

75
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,047
I've come to deliver this urgent
llamagram.

76
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,754
Llamagram. Thank you.

77
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,622
Everything OK, buddy?

78
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,293
Oh!

79
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,023
Are you kidding? It's just your
run-of-the-mill urgent llamagram.

80
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,619
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

81
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,494
I know. I'll tunnel out of here with
a spoon, escape through the sewers

82
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:23,572
and live as a quiet but lonely
shepherdess named Maria.

83
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,684
That'll work.

84
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,069
We're out of spoons!
That's it. I'm done for.

85
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,304
Chin up, big guy.
I'm here for you.

86
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:34,758
You! This is all your fault! You...

87
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,576
You're the one who got me into this
mess!

88
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:40,447
If you'd listened,
you could have had everything.

89
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:43,195
But no. You had to listen
to Miss Goody Two-Wings.

90
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,819
Mr. Goody Two-Wings.

91
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,155
Yeah, big talk coming from a guy in a
dress.

92
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,693
- I told you, it's a robe.
- And those are pearls.

93
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:52,768
Fellas! You're not helping.

94
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,896
Now where was I? Oh, yeah.

95
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:57,396
Doomed!

96
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:01,003
- What's with you?
- It's my father.

97
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:03,235
He's... He's...

98
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,812
...coming for a visit.

99
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,176
"Can't wait to meet your wife and kids
and see

100
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:10,713
your big house on the hill.
Cordially,

101
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,028
your father, Papi." So?

102
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,819
So Papi said I have to have all those
things if I'm ever gonna be a success.

103
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,396
And I once had them, but I lost them!

104
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,626
- So?
- I never told him that part.

105
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,359
Big whoop.
Tell him the truth.

106
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,028
What? Tell him the truth?
Are you nuts?

107
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:33,501
You don't let a guy like Papi down,
or you'll get one of these.

108
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,836
The Cold Shoulder, the Frenzied Eyebrow,

109
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:38,672
the Grimace of Doom, the Sneer of
Despair,

110
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,709
the Crippling Wince of Guilt,

111
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,806
the Scowl of Impending Wrath,

112
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:44,644
and worst of all,

113
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:48,150
the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection.

114
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,681
Total rejection.
Right, right. Mm-hmm.

115
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:54,205
I remember it well. Too well.

116
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,646
<i>You see, I was always...</i>

117
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,711
<i>...different growing up.</i>

118
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,908
Squeak, squeaker, squeaken?

119
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,090
<i>Papi didn't approve.</i>

120
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,626
<i>He said if I didn't get serious,</i>
<i>I'd never amount to anything.</i>

121
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,033
<i>But nothing I ever did</i>
<i>was good enough for him.</i>

122
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,487
<i>All I ever wanted was a thumbs up</i>

123
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:01,472
<i>from Papi.</i>

124
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,032
And I was so close.

125
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,303
I once had a beautiful house on a hill.

126
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,364
Papi woulda loved it.

127
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:13,850
That house was a dream come true.

128
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,134
Are you gonna tell me your life story,

129
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,771
or are we gonna get back
to running a restaurant?

130
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,726
You're right. Priorities.

131
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,178
Get comfortable.
I've got a lot to get off my chest.

132
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:28,278
Oy! I had to ask.

133
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:29,265
Oy! I had to ask.

134
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,601
My nightmare began on a day like any
other.

135
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,854
<i>So, technically, I guess</i>
<i>that would be a "daymare."</i>

136
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,391
<i>But I digress.</i>

137
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:40,159
<i>It was lunchtime, and I was making</i>
<i>my usual deliveries around town.</i>

138
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,226
<i>I always saved</i>
<i>the best stop for last,</i>

139
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:46,133
<i>to see my dear old friends at the</i>
<i>Flickering Embers Home for Seniors.</i>

140
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,833
<i>A happier group of folks</i>
<i>you'd never hope to meet.</i>

141
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:53,640
<i>A perfect example of how</i>
<i>to grow old with grace and dignity.</i>

142
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,206
Does this look like a rash to you?

143
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:58,545
Has anybody seen my teeth?

144
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,881
Oy! My aching knee.

145
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:04,684
I sure wish there
was some way to stop getting old.

146
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,655
If only they could put youth in a
bottle.

147
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:09,821
I'd pay anything for that.

148
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:11,523
Again with the youth potion.

149
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,996
- How many times do I have to
- There's no such thing!

150
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,195
- But if there were...
- But there's not!

151
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:18,998
- I said "if"!
- If, schmiff!

152
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,468
OK, you two lovebirds.

153
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,534
I don't have any youth potion,
but I did bring you lunch.

154
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,507
- Hello, Kronk!
- Hello, Kronk!

155
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,306
- Hiya, Kronk!
- Rudy!

156
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:29,507
Gimme some stick.
What's shaking?

157
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:32,176
- What isn't?
- Brought your favorite:

158
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:34,879
- Purée of mystery meat.
- Oooh!

159
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:38,869
Now that's a lunch I can sink my teeth
into.

160
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,189
And to complement your meal, prune
juice.

161
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,289
Ahhh!

162
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:47,159
Drink up, everyone! Liquid gold.

163
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,895
Ugh!
How can you drink that stuff?

164
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,882
Kronk says it's good for us.

165
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,613
Good enough for me.
Fill her up, Kronk!

166
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,522
- I guess that's everything.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

167
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,880
- No, that's not it.
- Here you go, pal.

168
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,280
From all of us.

169
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,782
Oh, no, Rudy. I couldn't.

170
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:11,382
We insist!
It's for your house fund.

171
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:13,618
You know.
So you can afford that

172
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:16,788
house on the hill your father
always wanted you to have.

173
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:20,925
Oh, yeah. And then I could finally
get the big thumbs up from Papi.

174
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,931
Yeah. How's that going?

175
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,984
Oh, I'll get there. Someday.

176
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,206
How about fresh pill bug tomorrow?

177
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,855
- All right!
- I'll see you all later.

178
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,492
Oh, boy.
Uh, somebody lose this? Anybody?

179
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,464
That's weird.

180
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,713
Ooh! Hey!

181
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,397
<i>Little did I know, my life</i>
<i>was about to be changed forever.</i>

182
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:02,567
<i>If only there'd</i>
<i>been some kind of warning.</i>

183
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,467
<i>A sign.</i>

184
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,351
<i>Anything.</i>

185
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,920
Oh, you're a feisty one.
Hold still now.

186
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,365
Huh?

187
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,403
Hmm...

188
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,873
Ahh!

189
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,393
All right. Where'd you go,
you little rascal?

190
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:31,939
Looking for... this?

191
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,106
Hello, Kronk.

192
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,474
Yzma! What are you doing here?

193
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,479
I live here. Ever since
I was thrown out of the palace.

194
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,610
Ah. Weird.
Never seen you around.

195
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,517
Ah, but I've seen you, Kronk.

196
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,683
- Oh. You look good.
- You think?

197
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:54,656
At least you're not a cat anymore.

198
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:56,523
- Except for that.
- Yes.

199
00:12:56,623 --> 00:13:01,091
An unfortunate side effect
of our last escapade together.

200
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,563
Yeah. Good times.

201
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:05,662
You drank that potion, turned you into a
cat.

202
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:08,501
Who would have thought?
It was a pink one like this.

203
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:09,986
Don't touch the pink one!

204
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,152
It's cough medicine.

205
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,412
Hope you get to feeling better.
I'd love to stay and reminisce, but...

206
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:22,433
- I've been watching you.
- Yeah.

207
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,663
And I have a proposition for you.

208
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,106
Ewww!

209
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,222
A business proposition.

210
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,423
Oh. Whoo!

211
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:36,026
You see, Kronk, I'm not the person I
once was.

212
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:37,195
I've changed.

213
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,532
I've turned myself around

214
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:43,369
and devoted myself to hel...

215
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:46,947
..."helping others."

216
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,541
Oh, well, that's some turnaround.

217
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,709
I want to help those old geez...

218
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,716
I mean, your friends out there.

219
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:59,552
Wouldn't you do anything
to ease their suffering, Kronk?

220
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:03,233
- Of course I would, Yzma.
- Good. Then follow me!

221
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,526
Pull the lever!

222
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,462
Uh... This lever?

223
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,640
- I worked out the bugs.
- Just checking.

224
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,285
Whoo! Huh?

225
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,459
Wait for it.

226
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,729
This is even better
than your last one! Whoo!

227
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,501
Welcome to my new secret lab.

228
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,558
- Souvenir photo?
- Rats! My eyes are closed.

229
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,406
Follow me!

230
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,160
Whoa! Looks like
someone's been busy.

231
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,795
I've finally done it.

232
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,836
I've created the elixir of life.

233
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,170
The answer to everyone's prayers.

234
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,670
Behold!

235
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:54,452
The fountain of youth in a bottle!

236
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,110
- Regular and diet.
- Huh. What do you call this?

237
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,517
Yzma's Young and Beautiful!

238
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:05,182
Heh. Catchy.

239
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:07,250
And now that you're here,

240
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,091
I finally have the one person
who can make my plan a success!

241
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,061
And that person would be?

242
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,239
- You.
- Me! I knew that.

243
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,997
Wait. Why me?

244
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,698
Because I'm not exactly what you call

245
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,602
a "people person."

246
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,802
And everyone trusts you.

247
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,708
Those old people will buy
anything you tell them to.

248
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:30,475
So you want me to sell this to them?

249
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:34,448
What do you say, Kronk?
Help me to help you to help them?

250
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:37,249
I can't take money from them.
It wouldn't be right.

251
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,383
Oh, too bad.

252
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:43,020
Now I guess you'll never get
that great big house on a hill

253
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,056
and the big thumbs up from Papi.

254
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,156
Papi?

255
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:49,795
Bingo.

256
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,783
Whoa!

257
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,141
What will you serve it on, Kronk?
Plastic Tupper?

258
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:11,049
Help you to help me to help who?

259
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,886
I need gold, Kronk!

260
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,588
I mean, you need gold.

261
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,630
"You'll achieve a beautiful
connection with your father."

262
00:16:56,863 --> 00:17:00,797
Yes! Now, sell, sell, sell!

263
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,897
Whoa!

264
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,851
Whoa!

265
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,734
Step right up.

266
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,315
It's finally arrived. The cure
for everything that ails you.

267
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,327
Yzma's Young and Beautiful!

268
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,748
Ugh. It's a, uh, youth potion.

269
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:17,848
Ohhh!

270
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:19,549
- Here you go.
- Kronk!

271
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,196
Does this stuff really work?

272
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,690
Does this stuff really work?

273
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,357
Of course it does, you idiot!

274
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,003
Of course it does, you idiot!

275
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,129
Good enough for me!

276
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:32,498
Drink up, everyone!

277
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:34,313
Liquid gold.

278
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,443
Oh. Look at my range of motion!

279
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,344
My elbow doesn't creak!

280
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:46,646
I'm melting away the pounds!

281
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,015
Hair! I've got hair!

282
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,608
Look out, old Yzma's back!

283
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,157
Well, that worked.

284
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,651
Suckers!

285
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,312
It's like a dream come true.

286
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:57,014
I put slime in a bottle, call it a youth
potion

287
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:58,817
and they can't get enough.

288
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,154
I'll be rich!

289
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:04,232
I'll be on top of the world! Again!

290
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,612
Shut up!

291
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,966
Whoo!
Could she be crazier? Cuckoo!

292
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,531
You see what's going on here, don't you,
folks?

293
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:18,439
Here's a hint. You got sewer slime,
fancy packaging,

294
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,971
crazy laugh like a demon from
the bowels of the earth. It's a scam!

295
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,311
Her potion's a fake!
She's selling snake oil, people!

296
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:26,645
Wake up!

297
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,711
Oh, you saw it already, huh?

298
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:32,236
Well, smarty, I bet you didn't see this!

299
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,721
Oh! Yikes! That's gonna
haunt me in my nightmares.

300
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,937
Can we just move on, please?

301
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,245
Guy in the booth!

302
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:46,985
Now!

303
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,024
Big load of happy coming through.

304
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,212
Doesn't get better than this, does it?

305
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:05,220
I'm making tons of cash for my house
fund.

306
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,852
Now if only I could find a house on a
hill.

307
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,656
Kronk, heard you were looking
for a house on a hill.

308
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:13,790
- You heard right.
- We need money for more potion.

309
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,163
- Oh, yeah?
- So we're selling the senior home.

310
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,547
Good luck with that.

311
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,019
How much?

312
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,269
Sold! Look, everyone!

313
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:28,087
- I sold the house!
- Hooray!

314
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,491
OK. Take care. Bye-bye.

315
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,091
Oh, yeah.
It's all coming together.

316
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,660
<i>Dear Papi, remember how you</i>
<i>never thought I'd amount to anything?</i>

317
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,096
<i>Well, I got news for you.</i>

318
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,693
<i>Good news!</i>

319
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:54,933
<i>I finally got that big house on a hill</i>
<i>you always wanted me to have.</i>

320
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,133
<i>It's really great.</i>

321
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,106
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>
<i>It's got all the amenities.</i>

322
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,351
<i>Swimming pool,</i>

323
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,454
<i>golf course...</i>

324
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,245
<i>The windmill's a killer.</i>

325
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,046
<i>And my favorite part of all...</i>

326
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,146
Whoo!

327
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:14,782
<i>Pancake Junction!</i>

328
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,720
<i>I even built a cozy little</i>
<i>guest wing just for you.</i>

329
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,425
<i>Yep. Just a big, serious house</i>
<i>for a big, serious guy.</i>

330
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:24,465
Like me. That's who I am.
Marge, you getting all this?

331
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,365
- Tina.
- Right. Sorry.

332
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:29,167
Anyway, Papi, don't just take my word
for it.

333
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,767
Come see for yourself.

334
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:33,086
I know you're gonna be so proud of
your...

335
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,638
...little Kronker.

336
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,076
- Mr. Kronk?
- Yes, Tina?

337
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,544
- Marge.
- Right.

338
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,609
Wait. What?

339
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:42,997
- A Mr. Rudy is here to see you.
- Rudy? Rudy who?

340
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,265
Hey, Kronk!

341
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,051
Oh, that Rudy.

342
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:50,506
Long time no see!

343
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,526
Rudy! What happened to you?

344
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,827
You're, uh, not wearing any...

345
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,297
...clothes.
- Oh, that.

346
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:00,267
I sold my clothes to buy
more of Yzma's youth potion.

347
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:01,533
You sold your clothes?

348
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,735
I sold everything.
We even sold the senior home.

349
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:07,106
- You sold your home?
- Yeah. To you.

350
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,440
Oh. Yeah.

351
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,008
- We're flat broke.
- That's awful.

352
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:15,348
I know. I can't afford
any more youth potion.

353
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:18,983
Think you can do anything
to help out an old friend?

354
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,683
Oh.

355
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,055
How about if I spot you a bottle?

356
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,025
My precious!

357
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:29,530
Kronk just wants to keep it.
We must not let him. No!

358
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,209
Something's just not right here.

359
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,204
Figure that out on your own, genius?

360
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,902
Yeah, sure did.

361
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:40,890
- Figured what out?
- OK.

362
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,094
Uh...

363
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,945
Take a look at your pal, Rudy.

364
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,623
This is before.

365
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,815
This is after.

366
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:53,894
Before. After.
You see any difference?

367
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:58,375
Hmm. Can I see "before" again?

368
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,779
Well, I give up.
They look exactly the same.

369
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,768
He looks exactly the same,
so the potion is worthless,

370
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:11,435
and Yzma's a crook, and it's all
my fault because I helped her do it.

371
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:14,788
What's the problem?
Look at him. He's happy.

372
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,190
Eh, fine. You win.

373
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh, yeah.

374
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:25,936
Rudy?

375
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,514
Yzma's youth potion is a fake.

376
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,451
- She cheated you.
- Oh?

377
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,022
And... I cheated you too.

378
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,102
Oh...

379
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,535
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,870
I guess we better go tell the others.

381
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,539
The others!
I almost forgot!

382
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,411
They're about to elect Yzma emperor!

383
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,578
I never knew that was an elective
office.

384
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:32,817
- Yzma for emperor!
- Thank you, thank you!

385
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:35,857
I'd like to thank all the little people,

386
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,324
but what do they matter?

387
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:40,537
What matters is me, me, me!

388
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,197
And when you elect me as your new
emperor,

389
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:46,682
I'm going to be on top of the world!

390
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,245
- Stop this charade!
- Yzma's youth potion is a fake!

391
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:58,208
- Stop this charade!
- Yzma's youth potion is a fake!

392
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,647
Kronk? What are you doing?

393
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:05,760
- I want you all to look at Rudy...
- Uh!

394
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,086
...and tell me what you see.

395
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:11,609
Whoo! That is one
hot hunk of man!

396
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,262
He's in his golden years.

397
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:19,531
Not getting any younger.
Chronologically challenged.

398
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,232
I got wrinkles,

399
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:23,434
bunions, ear hair!

400
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:25,535
I'm still old!

401
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:28,752
Hey, he's right.
I'm still old too.

402
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,143
Me too! And Hildy looks like...

403
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:33,776
Uh-uh-uh. Don't even!

404
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,547
Yzma's a crook!

405
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,626
- Yzma's a witch!
- Would you excuse me a moment?

406
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,071
Get her!

407
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:43,505
She's getting away!

408
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,459
Come on, fellas!

409
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,036
Hit it, girls!

410
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,360
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yippee!

411
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,871
- There she is!
- She's a liar!

412
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,974
- Get her!
- Stop her!

413
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:41,191
- Don't let her get away!
- Shame on you!

414
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,632
Got you!

415
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,166
Back off, or I'll jump!

416
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,292
Wait! That can't be right.

417
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:56,528
Whoo! OK. Why don't we all
just take a step back?

418
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,242
Not you, Yzma.

419
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,300
She stole everything we have!

420
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,083
Yeah, we didn't chase her
all the way down here for nothing!

421
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,904
Nice moves back there, Hildy.

422
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:11,861
Oh! What about you?
Pouncing like a wildcat.

423
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,382
Hey, I just realized something.

424
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:18,082
We chased Yzma all the way down here.

425
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:19,918
Didn't I just cover that?

426
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:24,723
Don't you see? We're busting moves
like a bunch of teenagers!

427
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:25,623
Ooh!

428
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,860
So, what you're saying is,

429
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,063
even though the potion was fake,
we're only as old as we feel.

430
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:36,018
It's like you should thank Yzma
for robbing you of every last cent.

431
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,705
Wait. That can't be right.

432
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:41,371
- Let's get her!
- Stand back!

433
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:42,674
Don't make me use this!

434
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:43,574
Ooh!

435
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,011
Your cough medicine?

436
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:49,179
No! My most fiendishly
diabolical potion ever!

437
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,226
When I drink this, you won't
be able to lay a finger on me!

438
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,543
Get her!

439
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,199
- How cute!
- Cutie pie!

440
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,187
See? I told you so.

441
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,410
That's weird.

442
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,645
Let's all reflect on these lessons
on our way home tonight.

443
00:28:20,745 --> 00:28:23,550
Well, everyone, back to the alley.

444
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,952
- You're living in an alley?
- Well, sure.

445
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:28,253
We sold our house to you.

446
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:31,725
I got dibs on the cardboard box!

447
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:34,261
Come on!
You had the box last night.

448
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:35,361
It's my turn.

449
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,262
This is awful. I've got to
find them a place to live.

450
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:41,566
But where can I find a gigantic house
with 30 extra bedrooms?

451
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,451
Where?
Think, think, think!

452
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,539
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Too much salt in my spinach puffs?

453
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,308
Oh, no! Your house!

454
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:51,608
Right!

455
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:54,614
Whoa, Nelly!
Let's not overreact.

456
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:56,515
You wanna lose your dream house?

457
00:28:56,615 --> 00:29:00,150
That's gonna get us the big thumbs up
from Papi.

458
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,622
If I lose the house, I'll let Papi down.

459
00:29:02,722 --> 00:29:04,186
I can't let Papi down.

460
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,322
But you tricked Rudy out of that house!

461
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:09,026
Oh, my! It's true!
I took away Rudy's home!

462
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:11,532
Hey! You got that house
fair and square!

463
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,596
Yeah, but he cheated his best friend!

464
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:15,175
No, he didn't!

465
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,454
Yes, I did.

466
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,085
I gotta do the right thing.

467
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:26,697
Rudy!

468
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,129
Let's talk real estate.

469
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,994
Looking jiggy, Burt!

470
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:45,015
Feeling jiggy, Kronk!

471
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,019
All aboard for Pancake Junction!

472
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,176
Tina! Marge! You'll be OK.

473
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,978
I'll help you land on your feet.

474
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:01,211
Don't worry about us.

475
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:03,961
We've been contacted by a team of
headhunters.

476
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,590
- But what's going to happen to you?
- Yes. You're giving up everything.

477
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,723
No worries. I may be
giving up everything,

478
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:15,892
but it was the right thing to do.

479
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:19,062
So when you think of our
brief time together here,

480
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:21,482
don't cry for me, Marge and Tina.

481
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,768
You didn't!

482
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,868
Afraid so.

483
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,276
Oy. Enough with the pity party.
You did good.

484
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:34,579
End of story. Back to work.

485
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,084
Yeah, but doing good cost me my dream
house.

486
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:39,350
- And then...
- Don't tell me.

487
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,950
It cost me my girl.

488
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,551
I said don't tell me.

489
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:45,924
These oven mitts were
the last thing she touched,

490
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,928
other than my fragile heart...

491
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:49,028
Oy.

492
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,105
...before she walked
out of my life.

493
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,296
Roll film!

494
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:54,996
Ah!

495
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:58,455
Wrong movie.

496
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:06,544
What's a troth?

497
00:31:06,644 --> 00:31:08,982
<i>It all happened at Camp Chippamunka.</i>

498
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,750
Yeah, right!

499
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,587
<i>We were there for the Chipmunk
Challenge.</i>

500
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:19,458
<i>We won Troop of the Year</i>
<i>two years running, going for three.</i>

501
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:26,428
OK, Chippers!

502
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:29,008
- First, we gotta pitch the tents.
- Yay!

503
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,155
And then we'll review
some basic camping terminology.

504
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,644
Hey, Bucky. Uh-huh.

505
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:40,614
Uh-huh. Squeakity-squeak.

506
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:43,949
There's a new troop leader named
Birdwell...

507
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,765
...who wants to take away our... trophy!

508
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,024
Look at them.
They're really snot and polish.

509
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:53,994
Yeah. It's "spit and polish."

510
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,124
- Snot.
- Spit.

511
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:56,563
- Snot!
- Spit!

512
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:59,763
Whoa. Easy, kids. Spit, snot,
same general neighborhood.

513
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:03,636
And don't worry about
this Birdwell guy, whoever he is.

514
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:06,539
The important thing here
is that there are no losers.

515
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,008
But you always win.
Right, Kronk?

516
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:10,409
We always win.

517
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:13,644
But winning's not what really counts.

518
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,114
Remember our motto.

519
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:17,360
"Keep the focus on fun!"

520
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,755
Two shorts and a long.
The Aquatic Games are about to begin!

521
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:24,623
You know what that means, Tipo?

522
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:25,822
Right.

523
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:29,425
Last one in's a rotten egg!

524
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,914
Hup, hup, hup, hup...

525
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,535
Halt! Left face!

526
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:38,336
- Troop leader?
- Yes, Junior Chipmunk?

527
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,104
Permission to speak.

528
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,271
Granted.

529
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:44,351
Yoli's afraid of the water again.

530
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,079
It's not me! It's Mrs. Queetzo.

531
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,952
Oh, gosh. Well,
we can't have that, can we?

532
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,888
Now, uh, um, give me the doll.

533
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:59,239
Yes. I'll have to have
a word with her. Now...

534
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,228
See here, Mrs. Queetzo.

535
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:06,132
Uh, Yoli is a top-notch swimmer,

536
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,765
and she's very, very brave.

537
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:11,367
So steady as you go, Chipper.

538
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:14,172
You're in excellent hands.

539
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,142
Yes. Mm-hmm.

540
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:20,046
Oh, super-duper!
That's more like it.

541
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:21,447
What did she say?

542
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:23,613
She's going to be just tickety-boo.

543
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:25,084
Very well then.

544
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:27,452
And off you go.

545
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,836
Hup, hup, hup, hup...

546
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,967
Let the aquatic competition begin!

547
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:38,949
Yeah!

548
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:41,845
This is gonna be fun!

549
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,149
Hurry up!

550
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,323
Cannonball! Cannonball!

551
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, I'm so proud of my little Chippers.

552
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,798
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

553
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,496
Oh, you're a troop leader.

554
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:12,208
Are you hurt?
Can you speak?

555
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,164
Blink if you can hear me.

556
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:20,039
<i>She was a vision. Feet</i>
<i>like a pair of landlocked tugboats.</i>

557
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,137
<i>Knees like brass doorknobs.</i>

558
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:25,876
<i>Elbows so rough they could take</i>
<i>the grain right off a two-by-four.</i>

559
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,509
<i>And her eyes.</i>

560
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,016
<i>They say the eyes</i>
<i>are the window to the soul.</i>

561
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:33,183
<i>Hers were more like</i>
<i>steel-reinforced security doors</i>

562
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,852
<i>with a combination</i>
<i>I just had to crack.</i>

563
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:37,601
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

564
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,040
<i>She was the kinda girl</i>
<i>you'd want to bring home to Papi.</i>

565
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,112
Wow! The Chipmunk Handshake
of Fellowship, Level Seven.

566
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:05,383
A level attainable only by the
most dedicated of troop leaders.

567
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:06,516
You're good.

568
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:08,117
Well, you're better.

569
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:09,353
You're sensational.

570
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,324
You're dazzling.

571
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:13,570
- I'm Kronk.
- I'm Birdwell.

572
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,231
- You're Birdwell?
- Yes.

573
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:21,877
- But you're a girl!
- Cannonball!

574
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,622
Ahhh!

575
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,914
- Awesome!
- Phat wave, dude!

576
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,383
Nice form, Chippers.

577
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,684
What do you think you're doing?!

578
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:41,384
Uh... Cannonball?

579
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:42,284
Duh!

580
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,624
Look at poor Mrs. Queetzo!

581
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:49,179
She's all... all...

582
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,015
...wet!

583
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:55,632
Well, it is a, uh...
swimming competition.

584
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:58,369
Oh, it's all about the competition with
you?

585
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:00,272
Yeah. Wait. What?

586
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:02,208
No matter what it does to the tinies?

587
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:06,680
Hey, I always put my, uh...
tinies first.

588
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,947
Ha-ha! Obsessed
with being first. I knew it!

589
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:13,060
Fortunately, there are rules
about this sort of thing.

590
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,887
- What sort of thing?
- Ahem!

591
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:19,724
Rule 4.7, paragraph A,
subsection 2, revised:

592
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:22,324
"Troops shall compete in alphabetical
order.

593
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:24,263
B before K, except after May,

594
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:27,768
or when sounding like A
as in 'neighbor' or 'weigh'."

595
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:30,670
- Says who?
- Says the Official Chipmunk Rulebook.

596
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,770
No way!

597
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,391
Way!

598
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:37,626
Troop Kronk is disqualified!

599
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,189
The aquatic competition goes to Troop
Birdwell!

600
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,486
Hey! That's not fair!

601
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:49,456
You ruined the aquatic event for my
poppets.

602
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,756
But now you've ruined it for my, uh...

603
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:53,822
- Poppets.
...poppets! I knew that!

604
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,228
You should've thought of that sooner.

605
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:58,714
Come along, Chippers!
Toodle pip!

606
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,867
Why is this happening?

607
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,605
I-I-I just don't understand.

608
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,806
It just doesn't make any sense.

609
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:12,712
Was it loop over, loop under and pull,

610
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,890
or loop under, loop over and pull?

611
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,248
Tipo? You OK, little pal?

612
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:19,652
We're gonna lose the trophy because of
her.

613
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:20,752
Yeah!

614
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,654
Now, now. Let's, uh...
keep the focus on fun.

615
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:30,028
- What about her?
- She disqualified us!

616
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:33,730
Yeah, and you're the best
troop leader ever, Kronk.

617
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,809
She can't do that to you.

618
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,121
Can she?

619
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,441
Just who does she think she is?

620
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,517
Just who does he think he is?

621
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,631
Poor Yoli.
You'll catch your death of cold.

622
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,214
And then he tries to act all innocent.

623
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:55,722
Thinks he can charm me
with those rippling muscles

624
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:58,191
and that... that... crooked smile

625
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:01,627
and those deep, deep

626
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:04,374
sensitive eyes.

627
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,969
No! He can't do this
to my little Chippers.

628
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,169
She can't do this to my little Chippers.

629
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:15,405
- Yeah!
- That's it. Oh, that's it.

630
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:19,176
The gloves are coming off.
We're going mano a womano.

631
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:21,857
Let the games begin!

632
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,243
Stroke! Stroke!

633
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,442
So. It all comes down to one event.

634
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,480
The Chipmunk Cheer-Off!

635
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,813
There's only one thing to do.

636
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,548
Practice, practice, practice!

637
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:35,954
Do whatever it takes to win!
Here's how we're gonna do it!

638
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:39,358
We're gonna hit them hard.
Come at them with everything we got.

639
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,591
Get out there and give a 110 percent!

640
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:44,147
Whatever happened to "keep the focus on
fun"?

641
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,511
We can't let him down. We just
gotta win that trophy for Kronk!

642
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,167
You know what I'd do? Cheat.

643
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:54,736
What am I hearing?
You can't do that!

644
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:56,838
- Nah-nah-nah-nah.
- Stop it!

645
00:39:56,938 --> 00:40:00,510
Ha-ha! Crybaby, crybaby,
stick your head in pie, baby!

646
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,589
Make him stop! Make him...

647
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,986
Hey! Kronk said,
"Do whatever it takes to win."

648
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:08,286
Right.

649
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,974
Whatever it takes.

650
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,523
Chin up, Chipmunks!
Victory is ours!

651
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:19,379
Soon as we practice our routine
ten times through without a mistake.

652
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:26,450
Uh-uh-uh! Spirit smiles!
I want to see spirit smiles!

653
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,238
Yes. That's more like it!

654
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:30,777
Peppy and poised!

655
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:34,477
Remember, don't think of your
opponents as a rival troop.

656
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:36,713
- Think of them as...
...the enemy!

657
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:38,218
Layout. Very good.

658
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:40,118
This is no ordinary cheer-off.

659
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:42,122
Basket toss. Higher!

660
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,855
This is a test of everything we stand
for!

661
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:48,957
- The culmination of all of our efforts!
- You call that a backflip?

662
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:52,966
By this time tomorrow, the trophy will
be ours!

663
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,415
Right, Chipmunks?

664
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Chipmunks?

665
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,639
Oh, man! This really stinks.

666
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:01,739
Yeah.

667
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,474
I want to go swimming.

668
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,377
I want to have some fun.

669
00:41:05,477 --> 00:41:07,488
I want to go home.

670
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,551
This is all her fault.

671
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:16,089
This is all his fault.

672
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:20,256
Well, if there's one sure-fire way
to cheer up a Chipmunk...

673
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:21,660
...it's raisin bread.

674
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,393
OK, flour.

675
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:25,745
Sugar, raisins, yeast.

676
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,743
I'm out of eggs!

677
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,214
Look at her. She's upset.

678
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:44,346
Take that, you...

679
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:47,517
You, you, you, you...
Take that!

680
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:50,557
"Upset"? She's beating me in effigy.

681
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:55,123
But her soul yearns for
the soothing salve of human kindness.

682
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:57,772
Go to her. Go.

683
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,135
Hey, look.
Aren't those your eggs?

684
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:06,572
"Kronk's. Property of Kronk.
Do not touch, except for Kronk."

685
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:08,818
Hey! What are you
doing with my eggs?

686
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,876
What are you doing with my raisins, sir?

687
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:15,443
- These aren't yours.
- "Birdwell's raisins.

688
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:19,284
Property of Birdwell.
Do not touch except for Birdwell."

689
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:21,395
Huh. You think
I would have seen that.

690
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,954
- I need those raisins.
- I need them more.

691
00:42:26,054 --> 00:42:28,658
- You're ruining this.
- You're wrecking it.

692
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:31,198
- You disqualified us!
- You tried to drown us!

693
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,863
- This is all your fault.
- This is all your fault!

694
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:35,233
- Is not.
- Is too!

695
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,635
- You twit!
- Give.

696
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:38,347
- You give!
- You!

697
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:11,314
So, uh... your kids
are really unhappy, huh?

698
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,987
Rock-bottom, actually.

699
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,510
I'm the worst troop leader ever.

700
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,859
I'm the worst troop leader ever.

701
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,820
- How did we go wrong?
- I just became so competitive.

702
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,388
Yes, but I'm even more competitive than
you.

703
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:34,808
You mean like that?

704
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,847
Hey, I like it when you laugh.

705
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,952
I've got a proposition.

706
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:43,683
I've got a proposition.

707
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,401
- My eggs, your raisins.
- Oh!

708
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:48,171
We could bake beautiful bread together.

709
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:50,440
Get out your oven mitts.

710
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,586
Things are about to get...

711
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,410
...hot.

712
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,160
<font color="#7F7F7F">♫ Earth, Wind & Fire: <i>Let's Groove</i></font>

713
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,646
I'm queen of the world!

714
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,955
Come on.
Throw caution to the wind.

715
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:49,996
I can't. You'll laugh at me.

716
00:45:50,096 --> 00:45:51,829
Don't you trust me?

717
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:53,780
I do trust you.

718
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,675
Whoa! It's like a whole new you.

719
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:06,175
Really?

720
00:46:06,374 --> 00:46:07,611
Uh-huh.

721
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:11,314
I think this has been
the best night of my whole life.

722
00:46:11,414 --> 00:46:12,814
Me too.

723
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:15,985
Good night, Kronky-poo.

724
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:19,372
Good night, Miss... Birdy-poo.

725
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,069
Kronky-poo?

726
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:34,818
I'm OK! I'm fine!

727
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,047
<i>Dear Papi,</i>

728
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:48,054
<i>remember how I've never</i>
<i>been able to meet the right girl?</i>

729
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:50,388
<i>Uh, any girl?</i>

730
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:53,859
<i>Well, I finally found</i>
<i>the woman of my dreams.</i>

731
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:56,412
<i>She's everything</i>
<i>you could want in a woman...</i>

732
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,443
<i>...and more.</i>

733
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,032
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>
<i>We'll take it nice and slow at first.</i>

734
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:04,132
Mazel tov!

735
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:06,167
<i>We'll marry in a fancy ceremony</i>

736
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,247
<i>and have lots of kids.</i>
<i>Love, Kronk.</i>

737
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,597
Perfect!

738
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,087
He found his one true love!

739
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:26,506
That is so beautiful!

740
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,816
Can I have a moment, please?
Turn away.

741
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,870
OK. OK. All better.

742
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,121
Go, go, go. Go back to the funny.
I'm bringing you down.

743
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,300
- Good morning, Chippers!
- We've got a surprise for you.

744
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,240
Raisin bread!

745
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,311
The one sure-fire way
to cheer up a Chipmunk!

746
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,966
Gotta tell you, Chippers, I'm, uh...

747
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:14,406
...not proud of how
I've been acting lately.

748
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:16,307
Neither am I, Kronky-poo.

749
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:19,374
- Huh?
- "Kronky-poo"?

750
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:24,249
So we're here to declare that
the feud between us is officially over.

751
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:26,063
That means no more hostility...

752
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,683
...quarreling...
...one-upmanship...

753
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:30,521
We're doing it again, aren't we?

754
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:33,059
They're finishing each other's
sentences.

755
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,134
Yeah, it's creepy.

756
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,362
But nice creepy.

757
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:41,963
The competition between our
troops has gotten out of hand.

758
00:48:42,063 --> 00:48:44,667
Which brings us to this afternoon's
final event.

759
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:48,337
- The Chipmunk Cheer-Off.
- You're not canceling the cheer-off?

760
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:51,709
Yeah. We've been working
on our routines all year!

761
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:54,376
Very well, but only on one condition.

762
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:56,646
From now on, we want you to play fair...

763
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:58,150
Be good sports...

764
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,849
...and...

765
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:02,531
Keep the focus on fun!

766
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:04,786
I'm so proud of them.

767
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:06,326
Hey, where's Tipo?

768
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:09,295
Kronk is gonna love this.

769
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:12,494
Scrape out these seed pods,
mash them into itching powder,

770
00:49:12,594 --> 00:49:15,501
sneak the powder into
their chalk at the cheer-off,

771
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:19,316
and they'll be completely humiliated
while we achieve total domination!

772
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:28,958
Everybody ready?

773
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,516
- Megaphones?
- Check!

774
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:31,916
- Pom-poms?
- Check!

775
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:33,318
- Team spirit?
- Go, team!

776
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:35,152
Go, team!

777
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:38,787
Chaca, there is no "l" in "team."

778
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:41,923
But there's a "U" in "euphoric."

779
00:49:42,023 --> 00:49:44,105
And there's a "me" in, uh...

780
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,238
..."mediocre."

781
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,333
I got you something.

782
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:51,736
For me?

783
00:49:51,836 --> 00:49:53,983
I know this is all really new.

784
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,508
And I hope you won't think
that I'm moving too fast,

785
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:01,223
but there comes a time when
a man's gotta say how he feels.

786
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,086
Oh, Kronk.

787
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,934
Monogrammed oven mitts.

788
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,732
Oh, just my size.

789
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,360
Good luck, Kronky-poo.

790
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,850
Thanks, Miss Birdy-poo.

791
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,106
Yo, crowd, let's get loud!

792
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:32,006
Go, Chipmunks!

793
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,790
Awesome!

794
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,882
- All right!
- Yeah!

795
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,204
Yes! Oh, yay!

796
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:36,906
That was wonderful, Kronky-poo!

797
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:40,975
You're gonna be even better,
not that it matters who wins.

798
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:43,347
- We've already won.
- We've already won.

799
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:46,284
Now I know you're just itching to get
out there,

800
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:48,619
but don't forget to chalk up your hands.

801
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,156
You don't want to fall.

802
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:51,590
I'm not worried.

803
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,166
I know you'd be there to catch me.

804
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,986
Say what?!

805
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,433
This is gonna be so awesome!

806
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,906
- I know. They're really good.
- Yeah, but we're gonna win.

807
00:52:41,006 --> 00:52:42,754
I cheated, just like you said.

808
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,077
Oh, that's great, Tipo.
Wait, what?

809
00:52:46,177 --> 00:52:48,176
I put itching powder in their chalk.

810
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:50,597
You said do whatever it takes to win.

811
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,054
<i>I know you'd be there to catch me.</i>

812
00:52:57,154 --> 00:52:58,754
Noooooo!

813
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,971
"Tipo's Itching Powder.

814
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:18,376
Property of Tipo.

815
00:53:18,476 --> 00:53:19,940
Do not touch except for..."

816
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,240
Tipo?!

817
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,382
How could you?

818
00:53:23,482 --> 00:53:26,115
I'm so disappointed.

819
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:28,419
Oh, no. What am I gonna do?

820
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,457
Eh, let the kid take the rap.
He'll do easy time.

821
00:53:31,557 --> 00:53:35,090
You put the idea in his head.
Look at him out there.

822
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,909
- He's six.
- Uh-oh, the lip. Not the lip.

823
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:40,995
Don't look directly at it!

824
00:53:41,095 --> 00:53:43,766
Start flapping your jaw,
the girl goes bye-bye.

825
00:53:43,866 --> 00:53:46,435
- Forever?
- Heartbreak City.

826
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:49,273
- No.
- So you're gonna weasel out

827
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:51,759
while they send Tipo off to the big
house?

828
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:55,510
You forgetting something?
You want this, you need that.

829
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,017
Dangerous.
You could have hurt somebody.

830
00:53:58,117 --> 00:54:02,420
I cannot believe that you would disgrace
the Chipmunk name in this manner!

831
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,496
But Tipo needs me.

832
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,025
Let him go!
It's all my fault.

833
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,325
Kronky-poo?

834
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,799
You told Tipo to cheat?

835
00:54:15,899 --> 00:54:19,286
I told him...
do whatever it takes to win.

836
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,063
Wait!

837
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:32,450
- It was all a big mistake.
- I'll say it was.

838
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,663
The biggest mistake of my life!

839
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,053
I thought I could trust you.

840
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,790
But Miss Birdy-poo...

841
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,936
Don't ever call me that again!

842
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,838
On second thought,

843
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,749
don't call me ever!

844
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,847
She's gone.

845
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:10,929
And all I have to remember her by are
these.

846
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,894
Now I've got nothing.

847
00:55:15,994 --> 00:55:19,561
No, what you've got
is a full house on fondue night.

848
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:21,465
Now give me one Havarti party pot

849
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:25,201
two blue cheese bombs
and a cracker cheddar surprise. Stat!

850
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:28,241
How can you think of fondue at a time
like this?

851
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:31,277
Look, you made the right choice.
You saved the kid.

852
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:32,744
But I lost the girl.

853
00:55:32,844 --> 00:55:36,378
Now I'm a two-time loser, and my
father's gonna be here any minute.

854
00:55:36,478 --> 00:55:38,850
More like any second.

855
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,751
Ah! What am I gonna do?

856
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:42,586
Just tell him the truth.

857
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:44,902
I can't handle the truth!

858
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,790
Where am I going to find a wife
and kids and house on a hill?

859
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,093
How's dinner coming?

860
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:53,274
I gotta get the wife and kids
back to our house on the hill.

861
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,401
You want to borrow my house?

862
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:00,968
- And me?
- And them, if it's no trouble.

863
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:03,639
Kronk, you should be ashamed of
yourself.

864
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:06,145
Trust me, I am, but not as much as I'd
be

865
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:07,877
if Papi finds out I'm a failure.

866
00:56:07,977 --> 00:56:11,349
He'll come with everything.
Cold Shoulder, Frenzied Eyebrow,

867
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:14,016
Grimace of Doom, Sneer of Despair,
Wince of Guilt,

868
00:56:14,116 --> 00:56:16,320
Scowl of Impending Wrath, and worst of
all,

869
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,807
the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection.

870
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,104
What's wrong with Kronk?

871
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,465
Duh. You made him look like a
big fat liar in front of Miss Birdwell!

872
00:56:29,565 --> 00:56:31,633
Hey, don't guilt-trip the kid!

873
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:35,270
- It's not his fault.
- No, he's right.

874
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,938
I've got to help him.

875
00:56:37,038 --> 00:56:39,006
Now come on, Chich, he's our friend.

876
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:40,106
Pacha!

877
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:42,643
You saw the Nostril Flare of Total
Rejection.

878
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:45,482
We have to do something
before his father gets here.

879
00:56:45,582 --> 00:56:46,830
Too late. He's here.

880
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,972
- Ah! It's him!
- I know what to do!

881
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:57,809
I'll just wait here, like a sane person.

882
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:11,727
Kronker?

883
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,393
Kronker?

884
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:19,124
- Kronker, front and center!
- Yes, sir! Oh!

885
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,239
Papi!

886
00:57:24,385 --> 00:57:26,522
What do I look like, your Aunt Matilda?

887
00:57:26,622 --> 00:57:28,155
Put her there!

888
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:29,255
Papi?

889
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:30,094
Papi?

890
00:57:29,894 --> 00:57:31,494
Huh? Oh!

891
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:33,931
Where are your manners, son?

892
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:36,835
Uh, sorry. Papi, this is...

893
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:39,753
- You must be Kronk's wife.
- I'm...

894
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,650
...Chicha.
- Chicha.

895
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,743
How'd this knucklehead
ever land a catch like you?

896
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:49,992
Well, he just asked.

897
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,013
Really.

898
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:53,591
And these are my grandkids?

899
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:59,198
Front and center, kids,
and... let me have a look at you.

900
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,694
I said front and center!
Names and ages!

901
00:58:02,794 --> 00:58:05,327
Chaca, sir!
Age seven and three-quarters, sir!

902
00:58:05,427 --> 00:58:07,597
And this is Yupi. He's only a half.

903
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:10,232
And, uh, that's my house up there,

904
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:11,981
on the hill.

905
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,341
Wow! I never thought
I'd live to see this.

906
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:22,888
You, of all people, with a wife,
kids and a house on a hill.

907
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,431
Son, I don't know what to say.

908
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,257
Kronkers! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

909
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:37,594
Now I really don't know what to say.

910
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:40,599
Who's this... lovely...

911
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:41,699
...lady?

912
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,500
Well, she's, uh...

913
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,747
- I'm Kronk's wi...
- Mother-in-law!

914
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,041
- Granny!
- Pach...

915
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:52,308
...ita!
Papi, this is Pachita,

916
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,124
Chicha's mother.

917
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:55,964
Ohhhh!

918
00:58:57,012 --> 00:58:58,297
Mother, huh?

919
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:04,437
<i>Enchanté.</i>

920
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,810
Now I see where Chicha gets her looks.

921
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,625
OK. Who's hungry? Let's eat.

922
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:12,828
Yeah, I'm starving.

923
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,248
I hope the chef here knows what he's
doing.

924
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,013
Yeah, so do I.

925
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,041
Whoa, little fella!
Where are you going in such a hurry?

926
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,172
Kronk's in trouble!
His father's here!

927
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:26,875
He doesn't have a wife or kids
or a house on the hill.

928
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:28,644
I've got to help him!

929
00:59:28,744 --> 00:59:32,015
Kronk's in trouble?
I know what to do.

930
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:33,783
Hang on, big fella!

931
00:59:33,883 --> 00:59:37,271
The cavalry's comin'!

932
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,861
Ah, well, isn't this nice, Papi?

933
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:45,831
You, me, Chicha,

934
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:46,731
Mom.

935
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,763
So, are you proud of me?

936
00:59:49,863 --> 00:59:51,168
Even a little?

937
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:54,673
Humph. I'm just glad to see
you gave up all those crazy ideas

938
00:59:54,773 --> 00:59:57,988
- about cooking and talking to animals.
- Kronk! Yoo-hoo!

939
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,444
Yeah. Crazy.

940
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:02,712
- Hey, Kronk, what's cookin'?
- Nothing!

941
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:07,050
There's no cooking whatsoever
going on here. No siree.

942
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,352
- What's he talking about? Him!
- Him who?

943
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:10,822
- Guy who was here.
- What?

944
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:14,056
- Why's he asking you about cooking?!
- Yeah. That's weird.

945
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:16,859
It's a... a business deal.

946
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:19,494
Oh, Kronk's always got something
cooking.

947
01:00:19,594 --> 01:00:21,365
Oh, yeah.

948
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:24,499
Speaking of cooking,
what does it take to get food here?

949
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,987
- Talk to the chef.
- I'll go!

950
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,574
Perfect.

951
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:32,240
Gives us more time to get to know each
other.

952
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,679
Oh... Oh! Lucky me.

953
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:35,945
I can't do this.

954
01:00:36,045 --> 01:00:38,984
- Look. Fondue night was your idea.
- Ow, ow, ow!

955
01:00:39,084 --> 01:00:40,148
Fondue!

956
01:00:40,248 --> 01:00:42,654
They don't get fed, they come after you.

957
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:44,570
Wait. I'll cook.

958
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,256
Feel that!

959
01:00:48,356 --> 01:00:49,936
Like a python.

960
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,229
Ordering.
One bucket of brie,

961
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:57,236
two Gouda gulps
and a flaming fountain of fondue.

962
01:00:57,336 --> 01:00:58,737
Cardio special. Got it.

963
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:01,037
And a side salad with poppy seed
dressing.

964
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:02,137
Papi?!

965
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,584
Kronk! Oh, thank goodness.

966
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,479
- So?
- So, what?

967
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:11,983
Hello! Anybody up there?

968
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,547
Where's our food?

969
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,070
I've worked up quite an appetite.

970
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,224
More water. Be right back.

971
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:20,524
Kronk!

972
01:01:21,326 --> 01:01:24,094
I mean... Kronkles!

973
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:26,463
OK. Stoke the fire.
Stir the fondue.

974
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:28,210
Chop the onions, lie to Papi.

975
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,636
- Machu Picchu!
- Kronky-wonky!

976
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:33,936
Who is this?

977
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:37,572
- Why, I'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk.
- Kronker!

978
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:39,787
Uh... Right.
I'll go check on dinner.

979
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,013
Hey! Is that any way
to treat the lovely Mrs. Kronk?

980
01:01:44,113 --> 01:01:46,762
I thought I was
the lovely Mrs. Kronk.

981
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:51,188
Look at us. Putting on dresses.
Pretending to be women.

982
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:52,989
Kronk! What are you doing?

983
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:56,191
Dinner rush. Four specials up
and a party of ten in at 8:30.

984
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:58,928
- Kronk!
- Kronk? Kronk!

985
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:00,764
Let me get this straight.

986
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:03,898
She's Mrs. Kronk
and she's Mrs. Kronk?

987
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:07,738
- Papi, I can explain.
- I'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk.

988
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:10,473
- Ow. You're stepping on my face.
- Or maybe not.

989
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:13,222
Is there anyone in this town
who isn't Mrs. Kronk?

990
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,680
- Daddy!
- How about them?

991
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,915
- Who are they?
- We're Kronk's adorable kids!

992
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:20,615
Oh!

993
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,183
Kronk!

994
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:25,190
- Sweetheart!
- Tina, Marge.

995
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,658
- Marge.
- Tina.

996
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:29,526
- Kronk!
- Well, at least that's everybody.

997
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:31,462
Boom, baby!

998
01:02:31,562 --> 01:02:34,365
Like how I weaseled
myself in the movie? Nice.

999
01:02:34,465 --> 01:02:36,902
- Kuzco?
- How you doing, hot stuff?

1000
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:38,078
Hot stuff?

1001
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,298
Kronker!

1002
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,620
<i>So this is right about where we started.</i>

1003
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,927
<i>Miserable. Covered in cheese.</i>

1004
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:06,743
<i>Trying to hold on to a big fat lie!</i>

1005
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,038
Papi...

1006
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:33,056
...I have a confession.

1007
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:36,426
I'm not who you think I am. I, uh...

1008
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:38,605
I'm just a humble fry cook.

1009
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,977
And a delivery boy.

1010
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,699
That's not all.

1011
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:48,313
Chicha's not my wife.

1012
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:53,345
None of these folks are my wives.
And these aren't my kids.

1013
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:56,213
Not even the ones who really are kids.

1014
01:03:56,313 --> 01:03:59,617
Yeah, and that big house up on the hill,

1015
01:03:59,717 --> 01:04:01,636
that's not mine either.

1016
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,971
And Pachita...

1017
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:10,228
...not even a woman.

1018
01:04:10,328 --> 01:04:12,894
I lied to you, Papi.

1019
01:04:12,994 --> 01:04:15,496
I just wanted you to be proud of me.

1020
01:04:15,596 --> 01:04:17,699
I just wanted to get...

1021
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:19,868
...one of these.

1022
01:04:19,968 --> 01:04:21,924
But all I ever got from you was...

1023
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,223
Yeah, that.

1024
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,545
I'm a failure.

1025
01:04:30,645 --> 01:04:33,349
The truth is...

1026
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:35,336
...I've got nothing.

1027
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,091
But Kronk,

1028
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:44,928
you've got us.

1029
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:47,995
And I wouldn't trade you guys for
anything.

1030
01:04:48,095 --> 01:04:51,036
Well, that would explain
why you don't have anything.

1031
01:04:51,136 --> 01:04:54,235
For your information,
Kronk used to have a big house.

1032
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:55,436
On a hill.

1033
01:04:55,536 --> 01:05:00,141
- But he gave it away to us old folks.
- And he had a girlfriend too.

1034
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:02,310
They baked us raisin bread.

1035
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:06,115
He gave up all those things
to protect his friends.

1036
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:08,682
You were actually listening to my
stories?

1037
01:05:08,782 --> 01:05:10,966
I was weeping on the inside.

1038
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,908
Wait a second.

1039
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:22,277
I really wouldn't trade you guys for
anything.

1040
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,668
Not even for a thumbs up.

1041
01:05:25,768 --> 01:05:28,640
You see, Papi, you may look at my life

1042
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,041
and think I've got nothing,

1043
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:33,288
but the truth is...

1044
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,621
...I've got everything.

1045
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,869
Not yet, you don't.

1046
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,490
I'm proud of you, son.

1047
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:51,862
Ohhh...

1048
01:05:51,962 --> 01:05:54,062
Whoo! Papi!

1049
01:05:54,162 --> 01:05:55,362
Awwww.

1050
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:57,644
Come here, you little squirt.

1051
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,463
Kronk, wait!

1052
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,547
Tipo! How's my little Chipper?

1053
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:14,728
I brought a friend.

1054
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,161
Hello, Kronky-poo.

1055
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,545
Miss Birdy-poo.

1056
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,804
I've missed you so much.

1057
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:36,915
I missed you more.

1058
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,626
I thought...

1059
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,944
We'd never see each other again.

1060
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:43,077
You know what this means.

1061
01:06:43,177 --> 01:06:45,780
If they're finishing each other's
sentences...

1062
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,302
...then it must be true love.

1063
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,821
- Kronk!
- Awesome!

1064
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:30,612
Huh?

1065
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,660
Oh, how cute!

1066
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,683
