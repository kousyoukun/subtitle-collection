Mr Beaumont?

35
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:59,279
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

36
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,458
Hey, Dad.

37
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:10,403
Do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

38
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,027
Yes, he's up in room 221.

39
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:16,865
- Right up the stairs, through that door.
- Thanks.

40
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,292
Detective Williams?

41
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:40,428
Yes?

42
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:44,929
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near
you. I believe you know my father Tom?

43
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,721
- Beaumont's Hardware Store?
- Sure I do. I hear he's in the hospital.

44
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:52,267
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.

45
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,769
They're doing tests.
I was at the hospital this morning

46
00:07:56,865 --> 00:08:00,945
and, coming home through
the field behind Vista,

47
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:03,741
I... found an ear.

48
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,368
You did? A human ear?

49
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:10,292
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

50
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:13,497
Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

51
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,512
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

52
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,758
Let's see what the coroner makes of it.

53
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:26,599
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

54
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:28,759
All right.

55
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:34,851
We'll check the morgue records,
but I don't recall anything minus an ear.

56
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,186
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

57
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:41,112
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

58
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:44,197
Once the tests are done, quite a lot.

59
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,616
Sex, blood type,
whether the ear came off a dead person.

60
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:52,320
Also, it looks like
the ear was cut off with scissors.

61
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,438
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

62
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,853
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

63
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:30,438
You're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

64
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,569
No, just around the neighbourhood.
Don't worry.

65
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,532
OK, honey.

66
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:53,934
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
Is Detective Williams here?

67
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:57,689
- Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks.

68
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:08,197
Well, Jeffrey, you found
something very interesting.

69
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:11,822
Very interesting. I know you must
be curious to know more.

70
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:17,078
But I have to ask you not only
not to tell anybody about your find,

71
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,087
but also not to ask more about the case.

72
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:23,174
One day when it's all sewed up,

73
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,715
I'll let you know all the details.

74
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,926
Right now, though, I can't.

75
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:32,011
I understand.
I'm just real curious, like you said.

76
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,594
I was the same way myself when I was your age.

77
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:41,102
- That's what got me into this business.
- Must be great.

78
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:44,019
It's horrible, too.

79
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:48,273
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

80
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:51,734
Anyway, I know you do understand.

81
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,570
Sure.

82
00:11:56,956 --> 00:12:00,621
- Thanks for the card for Dad.
- You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

83
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,786
You, too.

84
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:09,465
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

85
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:13,054
- Good night, Jeffrey.
- Good night.

86
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,018
Are you the one that found the ear?

87
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,659
How did you know?

88
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,083
I just know, that's all.

89
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,419
- I remember you from Central.
- Are you a senior?

90
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,545
Yup.

91
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,178
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

92
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:07,101
- I don't know... Boring.
- What else is new!

93
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,262
So what are you doin' now?

94
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,272
I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

95
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,481
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

96
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,644
What do you know about the ear?

97
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:20,485
- Didn't Dad say not to talk about it?
- Yeah, but you brought it up.

98
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:21,984
You know anything?

99
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:25,907
I don't know much but bits
and pieces. I hear things.

100
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:27,703
Yeah?

101
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:32,366
- My room is above my father's office so...
- Above your father's office?

102
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,580
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

103
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:40,000
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

104
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:43,127
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

105
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:46,504
She lives in an apartment
real close to your house.

106
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,052
Close to the field where you found the ear.

107
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:51,976
It's a strange world, isn't it?

108
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,927
- Yeah.
- Where is this apartment?

109
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:57,855
It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

110
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,016
They had her under surveillance,

111
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:05,317
'cept I don't know what they found out
cos she's not my dad's case. So...

112
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,406
I guess you gotta get
back home pretty soon, huh?

113
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:10,448
Not really. Why?

114
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,362
Well...

115
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:16,203
- You... wanna see the building.
- Yeah.

116
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,863
- Come on, I'll show you.
- OK.

117
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,756
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

118
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,545
That's her building right there.

119
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,720
She lives on the seventh floor.

120
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,345
Come on.

121
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:59,369
So... what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

122
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:02,159
Help out at my father's hardware store.

123
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:05,369
They're giving me my own hours, which is nice.

124
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:10,417
I used to know a kid that lived there.

125
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:13,542
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

126
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,668
What happened to him?

127
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:21,716
I don't know. He moved away.

128
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,381
All my old friends are gone.

129
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:33,524
- You know the chicken walk?
- What's that?

130
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:41,108
That's kind of interesting.

131
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,628
Coffee time.

132
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,760
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

133
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:12,139
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,
where they've always been.

134
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,387
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

135
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,392
Four.

136
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:21,104
I still don't know how you do that.

137
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:24,778
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

138
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:28,814
If you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

139
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,154
Okey-dokey, Double Ed.

140
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:34,496
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

141
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:58,680
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

142
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:03,691
- I don't know.
- I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.

143
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,643
Wait just a minute.

144
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,606
Listen. Don't you guys
dare say anything to Mike.

145
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,403
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, OK?

146
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:16,197
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

147
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,832
- I don't wanna cause trouble.
- I'm here, aren't I?

148
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,206
- He is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

149
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,337
You ever been to Arlene's?

150
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,335
Of course.

151
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,723
Now are you gonna tell me why we're here?

152
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,775
There are opportunities in life
for gaining knowledge and experience.

153
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:04,030
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

154
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:09,658
I'll bet someone could learn a lot
by getting into that woman's apartment.

155
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:13,120
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

156
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:16,582
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

157
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,334
Are you crazy?

158
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:22,755
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.
This is givin' me the creeps.

159
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:26,761
Now just settle down.
I have a plan which I think will work.

160
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:30,682
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

161
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,475
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

162
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:38,269
Tell me any plan you want, but it's not
going any further than this diner.

163
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:40,814
Sandy,

164
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:43,396
don't take that attitude.

165
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:49,366
All right. The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

166
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:53,368
- And open a window to crawl into later.
- How are you gonna do that?

167
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:58,202
Right out in the car I happen to have
some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

168
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:03,625
I will go to her apartment as a pest-control
man. I will spray her apartment.

169
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:09,465
You knock on the door, draw her attention
away from me, and I'll jimmy a window.

170
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:15,092
- And what do I say to her at the door?
- You will be a Jehovah's witness.

171
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:18,304
I have some "<i>Awake!</i>" magazines for you.

172
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:22,983
I don't need very much time,
just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?

173
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:26,228
I don't know.

174
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,943
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

175
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:37,073
- It's too dangerous.
- Sandy, let's just try the first part.

176
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:43,534
No one will suspect us.

177
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:49,416
No one would think two people like us
would be crazy enough to do this.

178
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:51,465
You have a point there.

179
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:06,015
Give me at least three minutes.

180
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:11,147
I can stall if it's more, but I need time
to find a good window. All right?

181
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:13,312
All right.

182
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:15,480
Let's go.

183
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:29,826
Here I go.

184
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,459
Wait a minute. What's her name?

185
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:35,381
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

186
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,467
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

187
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:43,003
Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy.

188
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:46,133
Thanks.

189
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,430
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

190
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,814
OK. Good luck.

191
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:55,099
Good luck yourself.

192
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:58,809
Three minutes. No sooner.

193
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,160
Yes? What is it?

194
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:51,336
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

195
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:57,761
- That stuff stinks.
- This is new stuff. There's no smell.

196
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,718
Good.

197
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:15,181
Just need to do the kitchen.

198
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:45,471
Grand Central Station.

199
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:00,308
It's only the bug man.

200
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,625
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

201
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,261
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What happened?

202
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,390
I was about to go to the door
when that guy did it for me.

203
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,518
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognise him?

204
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,309
I only saw his back. I think
he went out a door at the end of the hall.

205
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:53,986
I didn't get a good look at him either,
but he sure looked at me.

206
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:58,321
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?

207
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:00,984
Yeah, if they open the door.

208
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,824
Yeah.

209
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:22,093
So, what's next?

210
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,554
- Are you game for more?
- I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

211
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:31,809
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

212
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:40,192
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

213
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:44,702
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

214
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:48,156
Yeah. I do.

215
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:57,165
Well, that does that.

216
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:15,938
- You really wanna do this, don't you?
- I don't want you to get involved.

217
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:18,644
I do, but if something went wrong...

218
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:22,067
Like you said, they may be involved in murder.

219
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:30,699
OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

220
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:35,245
Just so the record is kept straight, though,

221
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,621
I love Mike.

222
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:42,207
What do you want me to do?

223
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:49,836
First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try
to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.

224
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,048
I already know.
The Slow Club on Route 7.

225
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,548
Great. I'll pick you up about eight?

226
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,643
Don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

227
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:03,148
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

228
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:06,352
You better get out before someone sees us.

229
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:16,193
See ya!

230
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,977
Wait. Here's to an interesting
experience, huh?

231
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,139
I'll drink to that.

232
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,356
Man, I like Heineken!
You like Heineken?

233
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:02,405
- I never really had Heineken before.
- You never had Heineken before?

234
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,985
My dad drinks Bud.

235
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:09,288
- King of beers.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

236
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:13,289
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

- Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

251
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:22,741
Cos it's crazy... and dangerous.

252
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,407
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

253
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:32,245
I don't think you should stay. I think you
should go home. Can you drive this car?

254
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:36,715
- Yeah, but I...
- Leave it in front of your house, OK?

255
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
OK.

256
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:41,087
I'll see ya tomorrow
and I'll tell ya how it went.

257
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,469
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

258
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:48,887
- Mike's coming over.
- OK. Can I call you?

259
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:53,429
OK, yeah, call.

260
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:56,857
I hope you sneak out OK.

261
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:03,030
- I'm gonna wait here until she comes.
- Sandy...

262
00:31:03,116 --> 00:31:05,357
I'm gonna honk four times.

263
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:10,611
I'll go one, two, three, four,
and then you'll hear it

264
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:14,288
- And you'll know she's on her way up.
- OK.

265
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:21,421
I don't know if you're
a detective or a pervert.

266
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:25,208
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

267
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,191
See ya.

268
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,852
Bye.

269
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:05,905
Heineken.

270
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,628
I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.

271
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,857
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow. Good night.

272
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:31,143
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?
Frank, let me talk to him.

273
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:33,805
Please, Frank... sir.

274
00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:38,730
I like to sing "Blue Velvet".

275
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:46,993
Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry.
Don! Don, can you hear me?

276
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,619
Is little Donny all right?

277
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:53,992
Is he there with you?

278
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:57,747
Don?

279
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:04,800
You mean Meadow Lane?
Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

280
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:11,098
I know. I'll be sweet.

281
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:15,344
Mommy loves you.

282
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:19,140
OK, Frank... sir.

283
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,056
Get out of there! Get out!

284
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,263
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

285
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,600
Get on your knees! Do it!

286
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,601
What are you doing?

287
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:42,277
- Who are you? What's your name?
- Jeffrey.

288
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,900
- Jeffrey what?
- Jeffrey nothing.

289
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:50,112
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet!

290
00:38:56,585 --> 00:39:01,330
Jeffrey Beaumont. What are you doing
in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

291
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,005
- I wanted to see you.
- Are you kidding?

292
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,168
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

293
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,760
- I've seen you before.
- I sprayed your apartment.

294
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,094
I took your key. I didn't mean
to do anything except see you.

295
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:17,676
What did you see, tonight?

296
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:21,685
- Tell me!
- I saw you come in, talk on the phone...

297
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:24,644
- And then?
- You got undressed.

298
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:30,480
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

299
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:32,650
No, never before this.

300
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:37,869
- Get undressed. I want to see you.
- Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

301
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:40,742
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

302
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,883
Stand up.

303
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,437
Come closer.

304
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,371
Closer.

305
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:39,546
What do you want?

306
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:43,966
I don't know.

307
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:59,606
Don't move. Don't look at me.

308
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,491
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

309
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:18,666
Don't touch me! Or I'll kill you!

310
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:23,426
Do you like talk like that?

311
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:25,299
No.

312
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:30,044
Get over there on that couch.

313
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:37,512
Lie down.

314
00:41:55,662 --> 00:41:58,663
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Hide in the closet.

315
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,999
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

316
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:36,195
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

317
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:39,818
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

318
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:45,955
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

319
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,296
Now it's dark.

320
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:11,389
Spread your legs.

321
00:43:22,408 --> 00:43:24,483
Wider.

322
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:28,943
Now show it to me.

323
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,010
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

324
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:21,869
Mommy...

325
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:32,636
Mommy! Mommy!

326
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:36,382
- Mommy...
- Mommy loves you, Frank.

327
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:39,596
Baby wants to fuck!

328
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:46,225
All right, get ready to fuck!
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

329
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:51,613
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

330
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:10,786
Baby wants blue velvet.

331
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:37,944
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

332
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:45,574
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

333
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,331
Daddy's comin' home.

334
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:55,623
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

335
00:45:58,174 --> 00:46:00,379
Daddy's comin' home.

336
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,139
Mommy! Mommy!

337
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,916
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

338
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:43,202
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

339
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:04,186
Now it's dark.

340
00:47:17,786 --> 00:47:20,408
You stay alive, baby.

341
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:25,497
Do it for Van Gogh.

342
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,063
Why don't you lie down?

343
00:48:01,618 --> 00:48:04,109
Come on, I'll help you.

344
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:15,579
I don't like that.

345
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:17,748
What do you want?

346
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:19,916
Nothing.

347
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:23,210
Are you all right?

348
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,757
Yeah, I'm all right.

349
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:32,144
I'm all right.

350
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:34,720
I'll go, then.

351
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:37,142
Don?

352
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:38,941
- Oh, Don!
- No...

353
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:42,728
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

354
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:46,071
I'm scared. I'm scared.

355
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:48,651
I'm scared!

356
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:51,112
It's OK. It's OK.

357
00:48:51,205 --> 00:48:53,778
Don? Don?

358
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:58,493
Are you back?

359
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,254
Do you like me?

360
00:49:14,226 --> 00:49:16,798
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

361
00:49:25,818 --> 00:49:28,392
Do you like the way I feel?

362
00:49:28,488 --> 00:49:30,564
Yes.

363
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:39,903
See my breast?

364
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:44,825
You can feel it.

365
00:49:47,463 --> 00:49:51,128
My nipple is getting hard.

366
00:49:53,052 --> 00:49:55,543
You can touch it.

367
00:50:00,642 --> 00:50:03,014
You can feel it.

368
00:50:04,396 --> 00:50:07,100
Do you like the way I feel?

369
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,266
Yes.

370
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:14,521
Feel me.

371
00:50:19,158 --> 00:50:21,282
Hit me.

372
00:50:22,412 --> 00:50:25,496
- Dorothy, no. Stop it.
- Hit me.

373
00:50:25,582 --> 00:50:27,205
Hit me.

374
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,451
Hit me!

375
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:10,869
I'm leaving now.

376
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:13,660
Torned.

377
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:17,326
Torned.

378
00:51:19,421 --> 00:51:21,498
Help me.

379
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,189
Oh, my God. That hat.

380
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:52,733
She's married.

381
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:54,072
"Don."

382
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,330
Help me.

383
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:50,377
Now it's dark.

384
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:53,203
Hit me. Hit me.

385
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:04,466
Man, oh man.

386
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,185
- Sandy, can ya talk?
- Mike's here.

387
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:16,192
Oh. I guess I'll talk to you later, then.

388
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:20,060
- Well, how'd it go?
- It went OK. I'll tell you about it.

389
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,697
I'll pick you up at eight.

390
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,531
New axe, 48721.

391
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:28,908
Twenty-two...

392
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:31,203
ninety-five.

393
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,997
- I'll see ya then.
- OK, great.

394
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:38,162
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

395
00:54:15,665 --> 00:54:17,241
Well?

396
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:20,954
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

397
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:24,212
OK.

398
00:54:28,926 --> 00:54:31,001
It's a strange world, Sandy.

399
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:40,472
Dorothy Vallens is married, to a man named Don.

400
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:43,513
They have a son.

401
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:49,976
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

402
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,735
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

403
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:57,987
I think she wants to die.

404
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,784
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

405
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:05,993
as a warning for her to stay alive.

406
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,749
Frank is...

407
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:14,712
a very dangerous man.

408
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:17,710
My God.

409
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:23,088
- Shouldn't you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

410
00:55:24,017 --> 00:55:28,310
I can't prove any of this.
I found out my information illegally.

411
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:31,313
You could get into a lot of trouble.

412
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:35,438
You saw all that in one night?

413
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:41,116
It is a strange world.

414
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,242
Why are there people like Frank?

415
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:53,915
Why is there so much trouble in this world?

416
00:55:54,545 --> 00:55:56,621
I don't know.

417
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:04,880
I had a dream.

418
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,005
In fact, it was the night I met you.

419
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,856
In the dream, there was our world,

420
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:25,941
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

421
00:56:26,032 --> 00:56:28,700
And the robins represented love.

422
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:36,331
And for the longest time
there was just this darkness.

423
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,367
And all of a sudden

424
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,663
thousands of robins were set free.

425
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:47,796
And they flew down and
brought this blinding light of love.

426
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:52,048
And it seemed like that love

427
00:56:53,098 --> 00:56:56,763
would be the only thing
that would make any difference,

428
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:59,678
and it did.

429
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:11,436
So I guess it means...

430
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:15,409
there is trouble till the robins come.

431
00:57:18,036 --> 00:57:20,029
You're a neat girl.

432
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:23,121
So are you.

433
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,699
I mean... you're a neat guy.

434
00:57:36,595 --> 00:57:38,303
I guess we better go.

435
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:42,213
Yeah. I guess so.

436
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:11,453
Hi. May I come in?

437
00:58:11,543 --> 00:58:13,583
Yes.

438
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:17,582
Hurry, though.

439
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:27,715
Are you all right?

440
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,930
No, I'm not.

441
00:58:31,562 --> 00:58:33,637
Why are you here?

442
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,807
What do you want?

443
00:58:38,192 --> 00:58:41,192
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

444
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:48,651
It's crazy, I know.
I don't know where you come from, but...

445
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:50,819
I like you.

446
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:55,614
It's not crazy. I like you too.

447
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,171
I liked being with you last night.

448
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:05,625
Same here.

449
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:13,761
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

Sandy.

01:02:48,753 --> 01:02:50,827
Oh, great.

474
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:54,578
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

475
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:58,173
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

476
01:02:58,261 --> 01:03:02,257
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

477
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:05,182
Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.

See that clock on the wall?

479
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,231
Yeah.

480
01:03:20,322 --> 01:03:24,154
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

481
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:30,662
Number one.

482
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:35,741
<i>Today I staked out Frank's place
With a camera.</i>

483
01:03:36,128 --> 01:03:41,963
<i>There's another man involved in all this.
I call him the Yellow Man.</i>

484
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:45,170
<i>You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.</i>

485
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:50,765
<i>Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.</i>

486
01:03:51,475 --> 01:03:54,844
Now, the only trouble is, what does that prove?

487
01:03:54,937 --> 01:03:58,720
Nothing, really. But it's interesting.

488
01:04:01,067 --> 01:04:03,274
Number two.

489
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:05,235
I saw the Yellow Man come out

490
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:09,022
and meet a well-dressed man
carrying an alligator briefcase.

491
01:04:23,587 --> 01:04:27,834
<i>They went to a factory, stood on
a staircase and looked into the distance.</i>

492
01:04:32,512 --> 01:04:36,805
Now get this. In the distance,
there was a murder.

493
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:41,349
<i>A drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.</i>

494
01:04:41,437 --> 01:04:43,512
<i>Jeffrey...</i>

495
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:51,774
Then two guys told me the police would
find drugs in the dead dealer's place.

496
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,740
I can't believe what you're finding out.

497
01:04:57,118 --> 01:05:00,616
Are you gonna continue with this?

498
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:02,780
Yeah.

499
01:05:03,248 --> 01:05:05,917
Until when?
What are you gonna do with this?

500
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:08,574
Well, I don't know.

501
01:05:10,504 --> 01:05:13,708
You're not going back to her apartment?

502
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,673
Yeah.

503
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:19,668
Jeffrey, why?

504
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:25,638
I'm seeing something that was always hidden.

505
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,969
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

506
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:33,638
And it's all secret.

507
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:37,439
You like mysteries that much?

508
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,604
Yeah.

509
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:44,733
You're a mystery.

510
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:47,321
I like you...

511
01:05:48,122 --> 01:05:50,114
very much.

512
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,666
Yeah?

513
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,719
Jeffrey, don't. Please.

514
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,780
You worry about me? Really?

515
01:06:23,863 --> 01:06:25,606
Yeah.

516
01:06:25,698 --> 01:06:28,189
Is that so surprising?

517
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:31,191
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

518
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,706

What do you want to do?

535
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,615
I'm doing it.

01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:17,081

Anything.

What do you want?

542
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,007
I want you to hurt me.

543
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:32,512
No. I don't wanna hurt you.
I told you, I wanna help you.

544
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:35,521
Dorothy, I know some of what's happening.

545
01:08:35,606 --> 01:08:38,560
Frank has your husband and son, doesn't he?

546
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:42,729
Dorothy, you gotta do something,
go to the police or...

547
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,565
No police!

548
01:08:46,783 --> 01:08:48,443
No police!

549
01:08:48,536 --> 01:08:49,566
Don!

550
01:08:49,661 --> 01:08:52,032
- Hit me!
- No! No!

551
01:08:52,121 --> 01:08:55,241
Get away! Get away from my bed!
Stay away!

552
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:26,729
I have your disease in me now.

553
01:09:51,258 --> 01:09:53,749
It used to make me laugh.

554
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:57,461
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

555
01:09:59,182 --> 01:10:01,886
- I should go.
- Yes.

556
01:10:08,607 --> 01:10:11,441
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

557
01:10:11,526 --> 01:10:13,815
I want you to stay.

558
01:10:13,903 --> 01:10:17,652
- Don't hate me.
- I sure don't hate you.

559
01:10:18,324 --> 01:10:20,483
I'm not crazy.

560
01:10:20,577 --> 01:10:24,490
I know the difference between right and wrong.

561
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,868
That's good.

562
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:30,995
You're my special friend.

563
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:36,667
I still have you inside of me.

564
01:10:37,508 --> 01:10:39,585
It helps me.

565
01:10:40,344 --> 01:10:42,420
I need you.

566
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,715
I'll call you.

567
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:47,846
OK.

568
01:10:48,185 --> 01:10:50,177
Soon?

569
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:56,016
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

570
01:10:56,108 --> 01:10:59,025
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

571
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:03,734
Hello, baby.

572
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:09,324
- Who is this fuck?
- A friend. He's from the neighbourhood.

573
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:12,613
We were just talking.

574
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:18,080
You're from the neighbourhood.

575
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,629
Yeah.

576
01:11:19,713 --> 01:11:22,203
You're a neighbour.

577
01:11:23,258 --> 01:11:27,255
- Well, what's your name, neighbour?
- Jeffrey.

578
01:11:27,344 --> 01:11:29,836
He's a good kid, Frank.

579
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:33,005
Shut the fuck up!

580
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,428
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

581
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:40,349
No, thanks.

582
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:43,275
"No, thanks"?
What does that mean?

583
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,767
- I don't wanna go.
- Go where?

584
01:11:45,862 --> 01:11:50,322
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

585
01:11:50,408 --> 01:11:52,696
OK. Let's go.

586
01:11:55,537 --> 01:11:58,241
Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

587
01:11:58,332 --> 01:12:00,123
Raymond?

588
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,449
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

589
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:04,619
Joyride.

590
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:20,303
All right, where do you wanna go?

591
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:23,977
Oh, I know.
We got to go to Ben's, right?

592
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,933
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

593
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:29,349
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

594
01:12:29,443 --> 01:12:31,518
We may all be killed.

595
01:12:34,738 --> 01:12:39,117
- He's a pussy, Frank.
- Yeah, but he's our pussy.

596
01:12:39,202 --> 01:12:42,700
- Right, tits?
- Pussy heaven.

597
01:12:42,787 --> 01:12:45,195
You ever been to pussy heaven?

598
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,453
No.

599
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:50,409
- What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

600
01:12:54,549 --> 01:12:57,668
- Po-lice call. Po-lice call.
- Bury that fuck!

601
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:00,632
This...

602
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:02,049
is...

603
01:13:02,138 --> 01:13:04,214
it.

604
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:05,923
Raymond?

605
01:13:07,894 --> 01:13:08,925
Thank you, Raymond.

606
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,438
Frank's here.

607
01:13:22,907 --> 01:13:26,952
Come on. I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

608
01:13:27,037 --> 01:13:31,033
Hey, Raymond?
You get enough beer for Ben, too.

609
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:32,996
- What beer do you like?
- Heineken.

610
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:35,918
Heineken? Fuck that shit!

611
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:37,580
Pabst Blue Ribbon!

612
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:45,130
I brought some friends, I brought some beer.

613
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:47,295
Fine, Frank, fine.

614
01:13:55,062 --> 01:13:59,723
Oh, Frank. This is a fine surprise
that you brought your friends.

615
01:13:59,816 --> 01:14:01,891
I love surprises.

616
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:04,894
Please, sit down.

617
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:11,281
Suave...
Goddamn, you're one suave fucker.

618
01:14:13,035 --> 01:14:16,072
- You want some beer?
- Of course, Frank.

619
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:18,322
Darling.

620
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:25,086
Darling, could you bring some glasses?
And we'll have a beer with Frank.

621
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,583
Thank you.

622
01:14:26,673 --> 01:14:28,750
Please, sit down.

623
01:14:31,303 --> 01:14:33,793
Shit, man. How the shit are ya?

624
01:14:34,514 --> 01:14:37,266
Fine, Frank, fine. How are you?

625
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:40,884
Fuckin' good. I'm real fuckin' good.

626
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:45,897

628
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,825
That doesn't scare me.

629
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,694
I'm Paul. What's your name?

630
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:05,866
Jeffrey.

631
01:15:16,552 --> 01:15:19,755
Where's the glasses?
That beer's gonna get warm.

632
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:24,424
One thing I can't fuckin' stand
is warm beer! It makes me fuckin' puke!

633
01:15:24,517 --> 01:15:27,268
Darling, where's the glasses?

634
01:15:27,353 --> 01:15:30,223
Here, Frank. Here come the glasses.

635
01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:32,472
See, here are the glasses.

636
01:15:32,566 --> 01:15:36,267
Raymond, where's the fuckin' beer, man?

637
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:38,519
It's right here, Frank.

638
01:15:39,656 --> 01:15:42,656
- D'you want me to pour it?
- No, I want you to fuck it!

639
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:45,446
Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer!

640
01:15:53,168 --> 01:15:54,710
Thank you.

01:32:10,592 --> 01:32:15,929
And then that man came out and met
with a third man. This well-dressed guy.

801
01:32:16,013 --> 01:32:18,848
Here's that photo.

802
01:32:22,519 --> 01:32:26,979
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

803
01:32:27,065 --> 01:32:31,228
I think Frank kidnapped her husband
and son. I have no hard proof of this.

804
01:32:34,363 --> 01:32:38,195
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

805
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:43,407
Who else knows you have these photos?

806
01:32:43,496 --> 01:32:46,865
Just you and the photo lab.

807
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:50,243
- And you're through with this now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

808
01:32:54,006 --> 01:32:58,880
For now, all right, you better be. And
Sandy better not be involved with this.

809
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:08,552
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

810
01:33:08,643 --> 01:33:10,767
Yes, sir.

811
01:33:19,154 --> 01:33:23,899
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. Is Friday still on?

812
01:33:23,991 --> 01:33:27,858
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.

813
01:33:27,953 --> 01:33:31,072
Why did I ever get you going on this, Jeffrey?

814
01:33:34,543 --> 01:33:38,670
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See ya then.

815
01:33:39,713 --> 01:33:42,002
Good night, Detective Williams.

816
01:33:46,594 --> 01:33:49,346
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

817
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:00,848
Dad?

818
01:34:00,941 --> 01:34:02,649
What's wrong?

819
01:34:03,693 --> 01:34:06,232
There better be nothin' wrong.

820
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:07,992
- I'll get it.
- OK, thanks.

821
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,788
- Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs Williams.

822
01:35:14,883 --> 01:35:17,171
- She's all ready.
- OK.

823
01:35:18,761 --> 01:35:21,383
- You look great.
- Thanks.

824
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,344
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

825
01:35:25,435 --> 01:35:27,094
- You all set?
- Almost.

826
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:30,355
Hey, John, get a move on.

827
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,434
Just a minute, Tom.

828
01:35:39,363 --> 01:35:41,936
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

829
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,652
Behave yourself. Don't blow it.

830
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:51,165
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

831
01:35:51,249 --> 01:35:54,582
So long, Jeffrey.
You two have a nice time tonight, OK?

832
01:35:54,669 --> 01:35:57,289
- OK.
- What's goin' on?

833
01:35:57,379 --> 01:35:59,751
Just a little fatherly advice.

834
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,832
That's right, Jeffrey.

835
01:36:01,926 --> 01:36:03,918
Come on.

836
01:36:04,011 --> 01:36:05,802
Bye, Dad.

837
01:36:05,887 --> 01:36:09,671
- Good night, Mom.
- Bye. Have a good time.

838
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:12,766
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

839
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:23,021
- Jeffrey, what was that all about?
- It's nothing.

840
01:36:23,112 --> 01:36:25,187
Really.

841
01:36:25,948 --> 01:36:28,022
It's good to see you.

842
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:30,940
It's good to see you.

843
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,199
You look beautiful.

844
01:36:42,045 --> 01:36:43,160
Thank you.

845
01:36:51,137 --> 01:36:53,212
Hi.

846
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:19,942
- It's all taken care of.
- OK.

847
01:37:20,622 --> 01:37:22,281
You want a drink?

848
01:37:24,876 --> 01:37:27,163
Wanna dance?

849
01:37:28,295 --> 01:37:30,370
Yeah.

Bye. See you later.

866
01:40:08,564 --> 01:40:12,313
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

867
01:40:13,027 --> 01:40:14,734
They're gonna hit us.

868
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:18,563
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

869
01:40:25,997 --> 01:40:27,658
Move it!

870
01:40:27,749 --> 01:40:29,824
Hang on.

871
01:40:32,628 --> 01:40:35,913
I can't outrun this guy.
My father's got a gun at home.

872
01:40:36,007 --> 01:40:39,090
- Jeffrey, no.
- Sandy, this guy's a killer. I promise you.

873
01:40:44,096 --> 01:40:47,845
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike.
Oh, my God.

874
01:40:56,025 --> 01:41:00,270
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

875
01:41:00,361 --> 01:41:03,694
You stole my girl, you bastard.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

876
01:41:03,781 --> 01:41:07,115
Right here, in front of your own
stupid house. Get outta here!

877
01:41:07,201 --> 01:41:08,860
Mike, stop it.

878
01:41:08,952 --> 01:41:13,281
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?
Nobody's talkin' to you.

879
01:41:13,373 --> 01:41:16,873
Come on, Mike. Look, I don't
wanna cause any problems.

880
01:41:17,794 --> 01:41:20,414
- Who's that? Is that your mother?
- Dorothy.

881
01:41:20,504 --> 01:41:24,716
- No, come here, you lvy League shit.
- She's hurt, in case you didn't notice.

882
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,291
Dorothy Vallens?

883
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:37,017
Come on.

884
01:41:45,444 --> 01:41:48,609
I'm really... Hey, I'm sorry.

885
01:41:50,865 --> 01:41:53,819
I'm really sorry.
I didn't know. I'm really sorry.

886
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:57,694
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

887
01:41:57,997 --> 01:41:59,739
We've gotta get her outta here.

888
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:02,832
Go to my house.
My father can get an ambulance fast.

889
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:06,417
- His partner won't be there, will he?
- Probably not. Why?

890
01:42:06,505 --> 01:42:09,670
- Nothing.
- Watch out for Mike.

891
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:13,335
Oh, God.

892
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:15,503
Is that you, Jeffrey?

893
01:42:15,972 --> 01:42:17,881
Yeah. It's me.

894
01:42:17,973 --> 01:42:19,929
Oh, Jeffrey...

895
01:42:20,392 --> 01:42:22,467
Jeffrey...

896
01:42:28,774 --> 01:42:31,265
Dad? Mom?

897
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:34,481
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom!

898
01:42:34,572 --> 01:42:37,027
All right, I'll be right there.

899
01:42:37,116 --> 01:42:41,195
- Is Dad home?
- No. He oughta...

900
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:44,447
You better call him.
And... get an ambulance.

901
01:42:44,539 --> 01:42:46,614
Where have you been?

902
01:42:46,707 --> 01:42:48,783
Oh, God.

903
01:42:49,042 --> 01:42:54,463
Oh, God, they've hurt him.
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

904
01:42:54,548 --> 01:42:56,873
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

905
01:43:02,722 --> 01:43:04,797
My secret lover.

906
01:43:06,726 --> 01:43:09,844
I've called for an ambulance.
The police are on their way.

907
01:43:09,936 --> 01:43:11,727
Don't get the police!

908
01:43:13,314 --> 01:43:14,773
Stop it!

909
01:43:15,567 --> 01:43:17,559
I love you! Love me!

910
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:23,147
He put his disease in me.

911
01:43:24,033 --> 01:43:28,362
Tell me it's all right I opened myself to you.

912
01:43:28,454 --> 01:43:32,153
- Tell me it's all right.
- Sandy, please...

913
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:35,581
- Sandy?
- I'll get a coat to put on her.

914
01:43:39,629 --> 01:43:42,714
Jeffrey? What's going on here?

915
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:45,125
I'll tell you.

916
01:43:45,218 --> 01:43:48,552
They... they've hurt his head.

917
01:43:49,555 --> 01:43:51,632
Who, Dorothy?

918
01:43:52,308 --> 01:43:55,392
Don. Help him.

919
01:43:57,397 --> 01:43:58,890
Help him.

920
01:44:00,315 --> 01:44:02,889
Promise me you'll help him!

921
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,698
He put his disease in me.

922
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:37,003
Would you like to come in the ambulance?

923
01:44:37,099 --> 01:44:39,173
I'll be right with you.

924
01:44:47,233 --> 01:44:49,106
I should go.

925
01:44:49,193 --> 01:44:51,268
- Go.
- Sandy...

926
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:02,069
Hold me! I'm falling!

927
01:45:02,163 --> 01:45:04,998
I'm falling! Hold me!

928
01:45:11,797 --> 01:45:17,003
- You lied to me.
- <i>Sandy, please, forgive me.</i>

929
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:20,050
<i>I love you.</i>

930
01:45:20,137 --> 01:45:22,710

933

I... But I couldn't watch that.

934
01:45:48,122 --> 01:45:51,122
- Is she OK?
- <i>Yeah, she's OK.</i>

935
01:45:51,207 --> 01:45:54,990
<i>Get your father. Tell him to send
the police to Dorothy's apartment.</i>

936
01:45:55,086 --> 01:45:57,659
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

937
01:45:57,755 --> 01:46:00,423

- I have to.
