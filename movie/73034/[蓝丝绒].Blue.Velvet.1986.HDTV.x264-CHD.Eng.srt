1
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:53,194
Blue velvet

2
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,362
Whoa- Whoa

3
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:04,703
She wore blue velvet

4
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:06,172
Whoa- Whoa

5
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:09,957
Bluer than velvet was the night

6
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:11,926
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

7
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:15,961
Softer than satin was the light

8
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,100
From the stars

9
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,599
She wore blue velvet

10
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,183
Whoa- Whoa

11
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:32,943
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

12
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,857
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

13
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,278
Warmer than May her tender sighs

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,910
Love was ours

15
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:50,869
Ours a love I held tightly

16
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:56,417
Feeling the rapture grow

17
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,676
Like a flame burning brightly

18
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,717
But when she left

19
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:13,312
Gone was the glow of blue velvet

20
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,526
Whoa- Whoa

21
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:19,194
But in my heart there'll always be

22
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:21,108
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

23
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,113
Precious and warm a memory

24
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,702
Through the years...

25
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,063
Logs, logs, logs

26
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:01,020
Glamour in the pines

27
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,814
Lumberton

28
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,195
USA

29
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:12,746
It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton,
so get those chain saws out.

30
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,076
This is the mighty W-O-O-D,
the musical voice of Lumberton.

31
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,242
At the sound of the falling tree...

32
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:23,453
it's 9.30!

33
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:28,339
There's a whole lotta wood
Waitin' out there, so let's get goin'.

34
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,565
Mr Beaumont?

35
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:58,695
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

36
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,874
Hey, Dad.

37
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:09,819
Do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

38
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:12,443
Yes, he's up in room 221.

39
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:16,281
- Right up the stairs, through that door.
- Thanks.

40
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,708
Detective Williams?

41
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:39,844
Yes?

42
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:44,345
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near
you. I believe you know my father Tom?

43
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:48,137
- Beaumont's Hardware Store?
- Sure I do. I hear he's in the hospital.

44
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:51,683
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.

45
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:56,185
They're doing tests.
I was at the hospital this morning

46
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:00,361
and, coming home through
the field behind Vista,

47
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:03,157
I... found an ear.

48
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,784
You did? A human ear?

49
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:09,708
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

50
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,913
Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

51
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:19,928
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

52
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,174
Let's see what the coroner makes of it.

53
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:26,015
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

54
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,175
All right.

55
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:34,267
We'll check the morgue records,
but I don't recall anything minus an ear.

56
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:37,602
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

57
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:40,528
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

58
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:43,613
Once the tests are done, quite a lot.

59
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:47,032
Sex, blood type,
whether the ear came off a dead person.

60
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:51,736
Also, it looks like
the ear was cut off with scissors.

61
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,854
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

62
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:27,269
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

63
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:29,854
You're not going down by Lincoln,
are you?

64
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:32,985
No, just around the neighbourhood.
Don't worry.

65
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,948
OK, honey.

66
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:53,350
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
Is Detective Williams here?

67
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:57,105
- Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks.

68
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,613
Well, Jeffrey, you found
something very interesting.

69
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:11,238
Very interesting. I know you must
be curious to know more.

70
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,494
But I have to ask you not only
not to tell anybody about your find,

71
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:19,503
but also not to ask more about the case.

72
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:22,590
One day when it's all sewed up,

73
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:25,131
I'll let you know all the details.

74
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,342
Right now, though, I can't.

75
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,427
I understand.
I'm just real curious, like you said.

76
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:36,010
I was the same way myself
when I was your age.

77
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,518
- That's what got me into this business.
- Must be great.

78
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:43,435
It's horrible, too.

79
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,689
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

80
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,150
Anyway, I know you do understand.

81
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,986
Sure.

82
00:11:56,372 --> 00:12:00,037
- Thanks for the card for Dad.
- You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

83
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:02,202
You, too.

84
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:08,881
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

85
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:12,470
- Good night, Jeffrey.
- Good night.

86
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:28,434
Are you the one that found the ear?

87
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:49,075
How did you know?

88
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,499
I just know, that's all.

89
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:59,835
- I remember you from Central.
- Are you a senior?

90
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,961
Yup.

91
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,594
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

92
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,517
- I don't know... Boring.
- What else is new!

93
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,678
So what are you doin' now?

94
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,688
I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

95
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,897
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

96
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:16,060
What do you know about the ear?

97
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:19,901
- Didn't Dad say not to talk about it?
- Yeah, but you brought it up.

98
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,400
You know anything?

99
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:25,323
I don't know much but bits
and pieces. I hear things.

100
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:27,119
Yeah?

101
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:31,782
- My room is above my father's office so...
- Above your father's office?

102
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,996
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

103
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:39,416
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

104
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:42,543
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

105
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:45,920
She lives in an apartment
real close to your house.

106
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:48,468
Close to the field
where you found the ear.

107
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:51,392
It's a strange world, isn't it?

108
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,343
- Yeah.
- Where is this apartment?

109
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:57,271
It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

110
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,432
They had her under surveillance,

111
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:04,733
'cept I don't know what they found out
cos she's not my dad's case. So...

112
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:07,822
I guess you gotta get
back home pretty soon, huh?

113
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:09,864
Not really. Why?

114
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,778
Well...

115
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,619
- You... wanna see the building.
- Yeah.

116
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:18,279
- Come on, I'll show you.
- OK.

117
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,172
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

118
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:28,961
That's her building right there.

119
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,136
She lives on the seventh floor.

120
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:40,761
Come on.

121
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:58,785
So... what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

122
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,575
Help out at my father's hardware store.

123
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:04,785
They're giving me my own hours,
which is nice.

124
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,833
I used to know a kid that lived there.

125
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,958
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

126
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:17,084
What happened to him?

127
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:21,132
I don't know. He moved away.

128
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,797
All my old friends are gone.

129
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:32,940
- You know the chicken walk?
- What's that?

130
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,524
That's kind of interesting.

131
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:03,044
Coffee time.

132
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,176
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

133
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:11,555
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,
where they've always been.

134
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,803
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

135
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,808
Four.

136
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,520
I still don't know how you do that.

137
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,194
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

138
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:28,230
If you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

139
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:30,570
Okey-dokey, Double Ed.

140
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,912
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

141
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:58,096
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

142
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:03,107
- I don't know.
- I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.

143
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,059
Wait just a minute.

144
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:10,022
Listen. Don't you guys
dare say anything to Mike.

145
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,819
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, OK?

146
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,613
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

147
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,248
- I don't wanna cause trouble.
- I'm here, aren't I?

148
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,622
- He is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

149
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,753
You ever been to Arlene's?

150
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,751
Of course.

151
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:50,139
Now are you gonna tell me
why we're here?

152
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:59,191
There are opportunities in life
for gaining knowledge and experience.

153
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,446
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

154
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:09,074
I'll bet someone could learn a lot
by getting into that woman's apartment.

155
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:12,536
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

156
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:15,998
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

157
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,750
Are you crazy?

158
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:22,171
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.
This is givin' me the creeps.

159
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:26,177
Now just settle down.
I have a plan which I think will work.

160
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:30,098
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

161
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:32,891
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

162
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:37,685
Tell me any plan you want, but it's not
going any further than this diner.

163
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,230
Sandy,

164
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,812
don't take that attitude.

165
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:48,782
All right. The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

166
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,784
- And open a window to crawl into later.
- How are you gonna do that?

167
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:57,618
Right out in the car I happen to have
some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

168
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:03,041
I will go to her apartment as a pest-control
man. I will spray her apartment.

169
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:08,881
You knock on the door, draw her attention
away from me, and I'll jimmy a window.

170
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:14,508
- And what do I say to her at the door?
- You will be a Jehovah's witness.

171
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:17,720
I have some Awake!  magazines for you.

172
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:22,399
I don't need very much time,
just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?

173
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,644
I don't know.

174
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:31,359
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

175
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:36,489
- It's too dangerous.
- Sandy, let's just try the first part.

176
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,950
No one will suspect us.

177
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:48,832
No one would think two people like us
would be crazy enough to do this.

178
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,881
You have a point there.

179
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,431
Give me at least three minutes.

180
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:10,563
I can stall if it's more, but I need time
to find a good window. All right?

181
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:12,728
All right.

182
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,896
Let's go.

183
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,242
Here I go.

184
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,875
Wait a minute. What's her name?

185
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,797
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

186
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:37,883
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

187
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,419
Look on her mailbox
for the number, bright boy.

188
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:45,549
Thanks.

189
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:48,846
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

190
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,230
OK. Good luck.

191
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,515
Good luck yourself.

192
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:58,225
Three minutes. No sooner.

193
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,576
Yes? What is it?

194
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,752
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

195
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:57,177
- That stuff stinks.
- This is new stuff. There's no smell.

196
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:59,134
Good.

197
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,597
Just need to do the kitchen.

198
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:44,887
Grand Central Station.

199
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,724
It's only the bug man.

200
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:30,041
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

201
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,677
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What happened?

202
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,806
I was about to go to the door
when that guy did it for me.

203
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,934
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognise him?

204
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,725
I only saw his back. I think
he went out a door at the end of the hall.

205
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,402
I didn't get a good look at him either,
but he sure looked at me.

206
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,737
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?

207
00:24:57,828 --> 00:25:00,400
Yeah, if they open the door.

208
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:02,240
Yeah.

209
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:21,509
So, what's next?

210
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:26,970
- Are you game for more?
- I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

211
00:25:27,062 --> 00:25:31,225
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

212
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,608
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

213
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:44,118
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

214
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:47,572
Yeah. I do.

215
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:56,581
Well, that does that.

216
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:15,354
- You really wanna do this, don't you?
- I don't want you to get involved.

217
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,060
I do, but if something went wrong...

218
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:21,483
Like you said,
they may be involved in murder.

219
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,115
OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

220
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:34,661
Just so the record
is kept straight, though,

221
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:37,037
I love Mike.

222
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,623
What do you want me to do?

223
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:49,252
First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try
to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.

224
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:52,464
I already know.
The Slow Club on Route 7.

225
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:54,964
Great. I'll pick you up about eight?

226
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,059
Don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

227
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,564
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

228
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:05,768
You better get out
before someone sees us.

229
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,609
See ya!

230
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:45,393
Wait. Here's to an interesting
experience, huh?

231
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,555
I'll drink to that.

232
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:56,772
Man, I like Heineken!
You like Heineken?

233
00:27:56,865 --> 00:28:01,821
- I never really had Heineken before.
- You never had Heineken before?

234
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,401
My dad drinks Bud.

235
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:08,704
- King of beers.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

236
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:12,705
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

237
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,637
She

238
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:34,806
Wore

239
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:45,863
Blue velvet

240
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:54,617
Bluer than velvet was the night

241
00:28:55,375 --> 00:29:01,247
Softer than satin was the light

242
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,039
From the stars

243
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:17,221
She wore blue velvet

244
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:24,975
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

245
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:29,780
Shadows

246
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:35,692
Fall so blue

247
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,247
As lonely as a blue

248
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,787
Blue

249
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,626
Star

250
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,575
- Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

251
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,157
Cos it's crazy... and dangerous.

252
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:26,823
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

253
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:31,661
I don't think you should stay. I think you
should go home. Can you drive this car?

254
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:36,131
- Yeah, but I...
- Leave it in front of your house, OK?

255
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,296
OK.

256
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:40,503
I'll see ya tomorrow
and I'll tell ya how it went.

257
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:43,885
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

258
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:48,303
- Mike's coming over.
- OK. Can I call you?

259
00:30:50,354 --> 00:30:52,845
OK, yeah, call.

260
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:56,273
I hope you sneak out OK.

261
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:02,446
- I'm gonna wait here until she comes.
- Sandy...

262
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,773
I'm gonna honk four times.

263
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:10,027
I'll go one, two, three, four,
and then you'll hear it

264
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:13,704
- And you'll know she's on her way up.
- OK.

265
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:20,837
I don't know if you're
a detective or a pervert.

266
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:24,624
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

267
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,607
See ya.

268
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,268
Bye.

269
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,321
Heineken.

270
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:33,044
I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.

271
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:56,273
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow. Good night.

272
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:30,559
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?
Frank, let me talk to him.

273
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:33,221
Please, Frank... sir.

274
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:38,146
I like to sing "Blue Velvet".

275
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:46,409
Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry.
Don! Don, can you hear me?

276
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:49,035
Is little Donny all right?

277
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,408
Is he there with you?

278
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,163
Don?

279
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:04,216
You mean Meadow Lane?
Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

280
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:10,514
I know. I'll be sweet.

281
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,760
Mommy loves you.

282
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:18,556
OK, Frank... sir.

283
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,472
Get out of there! Get out!

284
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,679
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

285
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,016
Get on your knees! Do it!

286
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,017
What are you doing?

287
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,693
- Who are you? What's your name?
- Jeffrey.

288
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,316
- Jeffrey what?
- Jeffrey nothing.

289
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:49,528
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet!

290
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:00,746
Jeffrey Beaumont. What are you doing
in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

291
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,421
- I wanted to see you.
- Are you kidding?

292
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,584
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

293
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,176
- I've seen you before.
- I sprayed your apartment.

294
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:14,510
I took your key. I didn't mean
to do anything except see you.

295
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,092
What did you see, tonight?

296
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:21,101
- Tell me!
- I saw you come in, talk on the phone...

297
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,060
- And then?
- You got undressed.

298
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:29,896
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

299
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,066
No, never before this.

300
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:37,285
- Get undressed. I want to see you.
- Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

301
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:40,158
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

302
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:00,299
Stand up.

303
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:16,853
Come closer.

304
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,787
Closer.

305
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:38,962
What do you want?

306
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:43,382
I don't know.

307
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:59,022
Don't move. Don't look at me.

308
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:12,907
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

309
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,082
Don't touch me! Or I'll kill you!

310
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,842
Do you like talk like that?

311
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:24,715
No.

312
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:29,460
Get over there on that couch.

313
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,928
Lie down.

314
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:58,079
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Hide in the closet.

315
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,415
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

316
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:35,611
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

317
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,234
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

318
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:45,371
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

319
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:00,712
Now it's dark.

320
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:10,805
Spread your legs.

321
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:23,899
Wider.

322
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,359
Now show it to me.

323
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:51,426
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

324
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:21,285
Mommy...

325
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:32,052
Mommy! Mommy!

326
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,798
- Mommy...
- Mommy loves you, Frank.

327
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:39,012
Baby wants to fuck!

328
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:45,641
All right, get ready to fuck!
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

329
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,029
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

330
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,202
Baby wants blue velvet.

331
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:37,360
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

332
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:44,990
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

333
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,747
Daddy's comin' home.

334
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:55,039
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

335
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,795
Daddy's comin' home.

336
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:16,555
Mommy! Mommy!

337
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:38,332
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

338
00:46:40,045 --> 00:46:42,618
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

339
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:03,602
Now it's dark.

340
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:19,824
You stay alive, baby.

341
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:24,913
Do it for Van Gogh.

342
00:47:57,906 --> 00:48:00,479
Why don't you lie down?

343
00:48:01,034 --> 00:48:03,525
Come on, I'll help you.

344
00:48:13,004 --> 00:48:14,995
I don't like that.

345
00:48:15,087 --> 00:48:17,164
What do you want?

346
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:19,332
Nothing.

347
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:22,626
Are you all right?

348
00:48:25,097 --> 00:48:27,173
Yeah, I'm all right.

349
00:48:29,768 --> 00:48:31,560
I'm all right.

350
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:34,136
I'll go, then.

351
00:48:34,731 --> 00:48:36,558
Don?

352
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:38,357
- Oh, Don!
- No...

353
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:42,144
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

354
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:45,487
I'm scared. I'm scared.

355
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,067
I'm scared!

356
00:48:48,452 --> 00:48:50,528
It's OK. It's OK.

357
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,194
Don? Don?

358
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,909
Are you back?

359
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:09,670
Do you like me?

360
00:49:13,642 --> 00:49:16,214
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

361
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:27,808
Do you like the way I feel?

362
00:49:27,904 --> 00:49:29,980
Yes.

363
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:39,319
See my breast?

364
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,241
You can feel it.

365
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:50,544
My nipple is getting hard.

366
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:54,959
You can touch it.

367
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:02,430
You can feel it.

368
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:06,516
Do you like the way I feel?

369
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:09,682
Yes.

370
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:13,937
Feel me.

371
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:20,698
Hit me.

372
00:50:21,828 --> 00:50:24,912
- Dorothy, no. Stop it.
- Hit me.

373
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:26,621
Hit me.

374
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:28,867
Hit me!

375
00:51:06,952 --> 00:51:10,285
I'm leaving now.

376
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:13,076
Torned.

377
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,742
Torned.

378
00:51:18,837 --> 00:51:20,914
Help me.

379
00:51:44,486 --> 00:51:47,605
Oh, my God. That hat.

380
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,149
She's married.

381
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,488
"Don."

382
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,746
Help me.

383
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,793
Now it's dark.

384
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:52,619
Hit me. Hit me.

385
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,882
Man, oh man.

386
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:12,601
- Sandy, can ya talk?
- Mike's here.

387
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,608
Oh. I guess I'll talk to you later, then.

388
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:19,476
- Well, how'd it go?
- It went OK. I'll tell you about it.

389
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,113
I'll pick you up at eight.

390
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,947
New axe, 48721.

391
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:28,324
Twenty-two...

392
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,619
ninety-five.

393
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,413
- I'll see ya then.
- OK, great.

394
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,578
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

395
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:16,657
Well?

396
00:54:17,665 --> 00:54:20,370
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

397
00:54:21,919 --> 00:54:23,628
OK.

398
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:30,417
It's a strange world, Sandy.

399
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:39,888
Dorothy Vallens is married,
to a man named Don.

400
00:54:40,853 --> 00:54:42,929
They have a son.

401
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:49,392
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

402
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:53,151
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

403
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,403
I think she wants to die.

404
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:02,200
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

405
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:05,409
as a warning for her to stay alive.

406
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:09,165
Frank is...

407
00:55:11,423 --> 00:55:14,128
a very dangerous man.

408
00:55:15,051 --> 00:55:17,126
My God.

409
00:55:18,554 --> 00:55:22,504
- Shouldn't you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

410
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:27,726
I can't prove any of this.
I found out my information illegally.

411
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:30,729
You could get into a lot of trouble.

412
00:55:32,149 --> 00:55:34,854
You saw all that in one night?

413
00:55:37,862 --> 00:55:40,532
It is a strange world.

414
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:49,658
Why are there people like Frank?

415
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:53,331
Why is there
so much trouble in this world?

416
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:56,037
I don't know.

417
00:56:01,342 --> 00:56:04,296
I had a dream.

418
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,421
In fact, it was the night I met you.

419
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:20,272
In the dream, there was our world,

420
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:25,357
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

421
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,116
And the robins represented love.

422
00:56:31,286 --> 00:56:35,747
And for the longest time
there was just this darkness.

423
00:56:36,707 --> 00:56:38,783
And all of a sudden

424
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:42,079
thousands of robins were set free.

425
00:56:42,171 --> 00:56:47,212
And they flew down and
brought this blinding light of love.

426
00:56:48,593 --> 00:56:51,464
And it seemed like that love

427
00:56:52,514 --> 00:56:56,179
would be the only thing
that would make any difference,

428
00:56:57,268 --> 00:56:59,094
and it did.

429
00:57:08,444 --> 00:57:10,852
So I guess it means...

430
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:14,825
there is trouble till the robins come.

431
00:57:17,452 --> 00:57:19,445
You're a neat girl.

432
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:22,537
So are you.

433
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:25,115
I mean... you're a neat guy.

434
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:37,719
I guess we better go.

435
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:41,629
Yeah. I guess so.

436
00:58:08,248 --> 00:58:10,869
Hi. May I come in?

437
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:12,999
Yes.

438
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,998
Hurry, though.

439
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:27,131
Are you all right?

440
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:29,346
No, I'm not.

441
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,053
Why are you here?

442
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:35,223
What do you want?

443
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:40,608
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

444
00:58:43,322 --> 00:58:48,067
It's crazy, I know.
I don't know where you come from, but...

445
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,235
I like you.

446
00:58:51,246 --> 00:58:55,030
It's not crazy. I like you too.

447
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:02,587
I liked being with you last night.

448
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:05,041
Same here.

449
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:13,177
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

450
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:21,312
Like a flame burning brightly

451
00:59:23,275 --> 00:59:26,441
But when she left

452
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:31,442
Gone was the glow

453
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:33,489
Of

454
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:39,988
Blue velvet

455
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:46,785
But in my heart there'll always be

456
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:54,174
Precious and warm a memory

457
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:59,382
Through the years

458
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:08,477
And I still can see

459
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:12,857
Blue velvet

460
01:00:13,904 --> 01:00:21,994
Through my tears

461
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,749
USA

462
01:02:12,844 --> 01:02:15,929
Logs, logs, logs. Lumberton, USA.

463
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,715
At the sound of the falling tree...

464
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:21,643
it's 1.30.

465
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:23,803
This is the mighty voice of Lumberton,

466
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:27,846
the town where people really know
how much wood a woodchuck chucks.

467
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:31,064
...seven, eight, nine,

468
01:02:31,152 --> 01:02:33,608
10, 1 1, 1 2,

469
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:36,188
1 3, 1 4, 1 5,

470
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:39,318
16, 1 7, 18, 1 9, 20...

471
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:40,987
Keep going.

472
01:02:41,078 --> 01:02:42,240
Sandy.

473
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:50,243
Oh, great.

474
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:53,994
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

475
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,589
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

476
01:02:57,677 --> 01:03:01,673
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

477
01:03:01,763 --> 01:03:04,598
Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.

478
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:16,396
See that clock on the wall?

479
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,647
Yeah.

480
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:23,570
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

481
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,078
Number one.

482
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:35,157
Today I staked out Frank's place
With a camera.

483
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:41,379
There's another man involved in all this.
I call him the Yellow Man.

484
01:03:41,465 --> 01:03:44,586
You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.

485
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:50,181
Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.

486
01:03:50,891 --> 01:03:54,260
Now, the only trouble is,
what does that prove?

487
01:03:54,353 --> 01:03:58,136
Nothing, really. But it's interesting.

488
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:02,690
Number two.

489
01:04:02,777 --> 01:04:04,651
I saw the Yellow Man come out

490
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:08,438
and meet a well-dressed man
carrying an alligator briefcase.

491
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:27,250
They went to a factory, stood on
a staircase and looked into the distance.

492
01:04:31,928 --> 01:04:36,221
Now get this. In the distance,
there was a murder.

493
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:40,765
A drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.

494
01:04:40,853 --> 01:04:42,928
Jeffrey...

495
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:51,190
Then two guys told me the police would
find drugs in the dead dealer's place.

496
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:55,156
I can't believe what you're finding out.

497
01:04:56,534 --> 01:05:00,032
Are you gonna continue with this?

498
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,196
Yeah.

499
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:05,333
Until when?
What are you gonna do with this?

500
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:07,990
Well, I don't know.

501
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,124
You're not going back to her apartment?

502
01:05:13,216 --> 01:05:15,089
Yeah.

503
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:19,084
Jeffrey, why?

504
01:05:21,306 --> 01:05:25,054
I'm seeing something
that was always hidden.

505
01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:30,385
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

506
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:33,054
And it's all secret.

507
01:05:34,068 --> 01:05:36,855
You like mysteries that much?

508
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:39,020
Yeah.

509
01:05:41,658 --> 01:05:44,149
You're a mystery.

510
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,737
I like you...

511
01:05:47,538 --> 01:05:49,530
very much.

512
01:05:59,006 --> 01:06:01,082
Yeah?

513
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:12,135
Jeffrey, don't. Please.

514
01:06:20,526 --> 01:06:23,196
You worry about me? Really?

515
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,022
Yeah.

516
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:27,605
Is that so surprising?

517
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,607
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

518
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:36,122
I got you into this.

519
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:42,368
Blue velvet

520
01:06:42,462 --> 01:06:44,122
Whoa- Whoa

521
01:06:47,343 --> 01:06:53,925
She wore blue velvet

522
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,129
Whoa- Whoa

523
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:59,014
Bluer than velvet was the night

524
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:00,929
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

525
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,065
Softer than satin was the light

526
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:09,268
From the stars

527
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:16,609
She wore blue velvet

528
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:18,233
Whoa- Whoa

529
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:22,076
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

530
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,873
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

531
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:28,288
Warmer than May her tender sighs

532
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:31,589
Love was ours

533
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,887
Come to my bedroom.

534
01:08:03,494 --> 01:08:05,867
What do you want to do?

535
01:08:05,955 --> 01:08:08,031
I'm doing it.

536
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,161
Are you a bad boy?

537
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,290
What do you mean?

538
01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:16,497
Do you wanna do bad things?

539
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:18,464
Anything.

540
01:08:18,675 --> 01:08:20,631
Anything.

541
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,258
What do you want?

542
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:27,423
I want you to hurt me.

543
01:08:27,516 --> 01:08:31,928
No. I don't wanna hurt you.
I told you, I wanna help you.

544
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:34,937
Dorothy, I know
some of what's happening.

545
01:08:35,022 --> 01:08:37,976
Frank has your husband and son,
doesn't he?

546
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:42,145
Dorothy, you gotta do something,
go to the police or...

547
01:08:43,906 --> 01:08:45,981
No police!

548
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:47,859
No police!

549
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:48,982
Don!

550
01:08:49,077 --> 01:08:51,448
- Hit me!
- No! No!

551
01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:54,657
Get away! Get away from my bed!
Stay away!

552
01:09:23,191 --> 01:09:26,145
I have your disease in me now.

553
01:09:50,674 --> 01:09:53,165
It used to make me laugh.

554
01:09:54,386 --> 01:09:56,877
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

555
01:09:58,598 --> 01:10:01,302
- I should go.
- Yes.

556
01:10:08,023 --> 01:10:10,857
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

557
01:10:10,942 --> 01:10:13,231
I want you to stay.

558
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:17,068
- Don't hate me.
- I sure don't hate you.

559
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,899
I'm not crazy.

560
01:10:19,993 --> 01:10:23,906
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

561
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,284
That's good.

562
01:10:27,707 --> 01:10:30,411
You're my special friend.

563
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,083
I still have you inside of me.

564
01:10:36,924 --> 01:10:39,001
It helps me.

565
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,836
I need you.

566
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,131
I'll call you.

567
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:47,262
OK.

568
01:10:47,601 --> 01:10:49,593
Soon?

569
01:10:52,313 --> 01:10:55,432
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

570
01:10:55,524 --> 01:10:58,441
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

571
01:11:00,445 --> 01:11:03,150
Hello, baby.

572
01:11:03,615 --> 01:11:08,740
- Who is this fuck?
- A friend. He's from the neighbourhood.

573
01:11:09,955 --> 01:11:12,029
We were just talking.

574
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,496
You're from the neighbourhood.

575
01:11:17,586 --> 01:11:19,045
Yeah.

576
01:11:19,129 --> 01:11:21,619
You're a neighbour.

577
01:11:22,674 --> 01:11:26,671
- Well, what's your name, neighbour?
- Jeffrey.

578
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,252
He's a good kid, Frank.

579
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:32,421
Shut the fuck up!

580
01:11:35,686 --> 01:11:37,844
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

581
01:11:37,937 --> 01:11:39,765
No, thanks.

582
01:11:39,857 --> 01:11:42,691
"No, thanks"?
What does that mean?

583
01:11:42,775 --> 01:11:45,183
- I don't wanna go.
- Go where?

584
01:11:45,278 --> 01:11:49,738
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

585
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:52,112
OK. Let's go.

586
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:57,657
Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

587
01:11:57,748 --> 01:11:59,539
Raymond?

588
01:11:59,624 --> 01:12:01,865
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

589
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:04,035
Joyride.

590
01:12:17,014 --> 01:12:19,719
All right, where do you wanna go?

591
01:12:20,477 --> 01:12:23,393
Oh, I know.
We got to go to Ben's, right?

592
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:26,349
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

593
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,765
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

594
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:30,934
We may all be killed.

595
01:12:34,154 --> 01:12:38,533
- He's a pussy, Frank.
- Yeah, but he's our pussy.

596
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:42,116
- Right, tits?
- Pussy heaven.

597
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:44,611
You ever been to pussy heaven?

598
01:12:44,706 --> 01:12:45,869
No.

599
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:49,825
- What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

600
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:57,084
- Po-lice call. Po-lice call.
- Bury that fuck!

601
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,048
This...

602
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:01,465
is...

603
01:13:01,554 --> 01:13:03,630
it.

604
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:05,339
Raymond?

605
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,341
Thank you, Raymond.

606
01:13:17,777 --> 01:13:19,854
Frank's here.

607
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:26,368
Come on. I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

608
01:13:26,453 --> 01:13:30,449
Hey, Raymond?
You get enough beer for Ben, too.

609
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,412
- What beer do you like?
- Heineken.

610
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:35,334
Heineken? Fuck that shit!

611
01:13:35,418 --> 01:13:36,996
Pabst Blue Ribbon!

612
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:44,946
I brought some friends,
I brought some beer.

613
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:47,111
Fine, Frank, fine.

614
01:13:54,878 --> 01:13:59,539
Oh, Frank. This is a fine surprise
that you brought your friends.

615
01:13:59,632 --> 01:14:01,707
I love surprises.

616
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:04,710
Please, sit down.

617
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:11,097
Suave...
Goddamn, you're one suave fucker.

618
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:15,888
- You want some beer?
- Of course, Frank.

619
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:18,138
Darling.

620
01:14:20,609 --> 01:14:24,902
Darling, could you bring some glasses?
And we'll have a beer with Frank.

621
01:14:24,988 --> 01:14:26,399
Thank you.

622
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:28,566
Please, sit down.

623
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:33,609
Shit, man. How the shit are ya?

624
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:37,082
Fine, Frank, fine. How are you?

625
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:40,700
Fuckin' good. I'm real fuckin' good.

626
01:14:42,629 --> 01:14:45,713
Here today,

627
01:14:45,798 --> 01:14:48,468
gone tomorrow.

628
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,641
That doesn't scare me.

629
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:03,510
I'm Paul. What's your name?

630
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:05,682
Jeffrey.

631
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:19,571
Where's the glasses?
That beer's gonna get warm.

632
01:15:19,663 --> 01:15:24,240
One thing I can't fuckin' stand
is warm beer! It makes me fuckin' puke!

633
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,084
Darling, where's the glasses?

634
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:30,039
Here, Frank. Here come the glasses.

635
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:32,288
See, here are the glasses.

636
01:15:32,382 --> 01:15:36,083
Raymond, where's the fuckin' beer, man?

637
01:15:36,177 --> 01:15:38,335
It's right here, Frank.

638
01:15:39,472 --> 01:15:42,472
- D'you want me to pour it?
- No, I want you to fuck it!

639
01:15:42,557 --> 01:15:45,262
Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer!

640
01:15:52,984 --> 01:15:54,526
Thank you.

641
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,695
- Let's drink up.
- Here's to your health.

642
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,485
Shit, let's drink to somethin' else.

643
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:03,857
Let's drink to fucking.

644
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:08,745
Yeah, say "Here's to your fuck, Frank."

645
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:10,871
If you like, Frank.

646
01:16:10,959 --> 01:16:13,959
Here's to your fuck. Cheers.

647
01:16:15,713 --> 01:16:19,046
Cheers. Wow. Suave, man.

648
01:16:19,634 --> 01:16:21,874
You are so fuckin' suave.

649
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,966
- Hey, we love Ben.
- We love Ben.

650
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,429
- Here's to Ben!
- Here's to Ben.

651
01:16:34,563 --> 01:16:35,938
Here's to Ben.

652
01:16:37,983 --> 01:16:40,688
- Here's to Ben.
- Be polite!

653
01:16:42,195 --> 01:16:45,065
Here's to Ben.

654
01:16:46,824 --> 01:16:48,900
See that, Ben?

655
01:16:50,161 --> 01:16:53,077
I can make him do anything I please.

656
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:03,255
Thank you for the toast.
That was very nice, neighbour.

657
01:17:03,339 --> 01:17:05,829
Did he hurt your little face?

658
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,797
That feel better?

659
01:17:14,641 --> 01:17:17,393
Frank, I have something for ya.

660
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:20,848
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

661
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:23,227
Excuse us, por favor.

662
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:26,604
Raymond, do a little baby-sitting.

663
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,609
I'm Paul.

664
01:17:53,175 --> 01:17:57,255
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad
daylight, cos he's the man, right?

665
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:01,429
He took those drugs away
and it was fuckin' beautiful.

666
01:18:02,185 --> 01:18:05,801
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman.

667
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:12,318
Let Tits see her kid, huh?

668
01:18:25,871 --> 01:18:29,537
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman.

669
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:31,702
Donny! Donny!

670
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:33,911
Oh, Donny!

671
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:39,002
No! No! Donny, Mama loves you!

672
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:56,596
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman

673
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,775
Tiptoes to my room every night

674
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:03,897
Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper

675
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,818
"Go to sleep"

676
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:10,074
"Everything is all right"

677
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:14,784
I close my eyes

678
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,623
Then I drift away

679
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:24,168
Into the magic night

680
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:28,002
I softly say

681
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:32,843
A silent prayer

682
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:36,967
Like dreamers do

683
01:19:38,146 --> 01:19:42,096
Then I fall asleep to dream

684
01:19:42,608 --> 01:19:46,023
My dreams of you

685
01:19:48,446 --> 01:19:52,112
In dreams I walk

686
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:55,068
With you

687
01:19:57,538 --> 01:20:01,156
In dreams I talk

688
01:20:02,043 --> 01:20:04,117
To you

689
01:20:06,546 --> 01:20:10,875
In dreams you're mine

690
01:20:11,843 --> 01:20:14,594
All the time

691
01:20:14,678 --> 01:20:18,759
We're together

692
01:20:21,268 --> 01:20:24,601
All right! Let's hit the fuckin' road!

693
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:27,972
We're givin' our neighbour a joyride!
Let's get on with it!

694
01:20:28,525 --> 01:20:29,900
Bye, Ben.

695
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:33,482
Anyone wanna go on a joyride with us?

696
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,654
How about you? Huh?

697
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:42,528
No smile for Frank? No?

698
01:20:44,038 --> 01:20:46,528
OK, fuck it! Let's go!

699
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:51,537
You wanna go with Raymond?
Come on.

700
01:20:54,172 --> 01:20:56,746
I'll see ya Tuesday, Frank.

701
01:20:57,133 --> 01:20:59,209
Right, Ben.

702
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,967
Now it's dark.

703
01:21:06,559 --> 01:21:08,966
Let's fuck!

704
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:12,181
I'll fuck anything that moves!

705
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:32,247
Where are we going, Frank?

706
01:21:32,332 --> 01:21:36,993
I'm takin' your neighbour
out to the fuckin' country.

707
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:40,377
Hey, do you like to walk?

708
01:21:40,465 --> 01:21:43,583
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, shithead.
- What?

709
01:21:43,675 --> 01:21:46,000
He said "What?", Frank.

710
01:21:47,429 --> 01:21:48,674
What.

711
01:21:54,102 --> 01:21:57,387
Hey! What has this fuck
got to do with anything?

712
01:21:58,021 --> 01:22:00,513
Jesus, goddamn.

713
01:22:07,697 --> 01:22:09,773
You fuck!

714
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,989
What're you looking at?

715
01:22:13,077 --> 01:22:14,985
Nothing.

716
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:17,569
Don't you look at me, fuck!

717
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:21,162
I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.

718
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,437
You're like me.

719
01:22:52,404 --> 01:22:54,479
Oh, look at those.

720
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:57,278
What are these?

721
01:22:57,367 --> 01:23:00,818
- Please, Frank, let's go.
- Don't say please, fuckhead!

722
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:07,491
Ooh, baby...
Ooh, baby wants to pinch them.

723
01:23:09,878 --> 01:23:15,631
What's the matter? Give 'em back.
They're just a little red, that's all.

724
01:23:15,717 --> 01:23:19,168
Ooh, let me feel 'em. Come here.

725
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:21,670
Leave her alone!

726
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,513
Goddamn!

727
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,934
Next!

728
01:23:32,023 --> 01:23:36,815
You, out of the car, fuck!
Get him out of the car, Raymond!

729
01:23:38,488 --> 01:23:42,651
- Frank! Frank! He didn't mean anything!
- Shut up! Shut up.

730
01:23:57,671 --> 01:24:01,206
Pretty, pretty. Pretty, pretty.

731
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:06,509
Frank, leave him alone!

732
01:24:06,596 --> 01:24:08,505
Frank! Frank!

733
01:24:13,019 --> 01:24:16,932
Paul... candy-coloured clown.

734
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:21,437
You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.

735
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:24,895
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman

736
01:24:24,987 --> 01:24:27,858
-  Tiptoes to my room every night
- Look at me.

737
01:24:29,242 --> 01:24:32,693
Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper

738
01:24:32,786 --> 01:24:38,575
-  "Go to sleep, everything is all right"
- Candy-coloured clown.

739
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:42,038
I close my eyes

740
01:24:43,755 --> 01:24:47,040
Then I drift away

741
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:50,634
Don't be a good neighbour to her.

742
01:24:51,762 --> 01:24:54,513
I'll send you a love letter.

743
01:24:54,972 --> 01:24:57,677
Straight from my heart, fucker!

744
01:24:58,768 --> 01:25:01,176
Do you know what a love letter is?

745
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:04,354
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker.

746
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:10,062
You receive a love letter from me,
you are fucked for ever!

747
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:12,862
You understand, fuck?

748
01:25:15,992 --> 01:25:19,194
- I'll send you straight to hell, fucker!
-  In dreams

749
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:21,279
I walk

750
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:24,455
-  With you
- In dreams...

751
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:27,997
- I walk with you.
-  In dreams

752
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:33,626
-  I talk to you
- In dreams... I talk... to you.

753
01:25:34,926 --> 01:25:40,002
-  In dreams you're mine
- In dreams... you're mine.

754
01:25:40,097 --> 01:25:42,884
-  All the time
- All...

755
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:47,351
We're together

756
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:52,478
-  In dreams, in dreams
- For ever in dreams.

757
01:25:55,027 --> 01:25:57,102
But just

758
01:25:57,405 --> 01:26:00,571
Before the dawn

759
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:08,536
-  I awake and find
- Feel this.

760
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:10,497
You gone

761
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,876
I can't help it

762
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:17,454
I can't help it

763
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:20,501
If I cry

764
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,213
Feel my muscles. Huh?

765
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,171
Feel 'em! Huh? You like that?

766
01:26:29,141 --> 01:26:31,430
Hold him tight for me.

767
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:36,677
Frank, stop it!

768
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:41,315
Frank, stop it! Frank! Stop!

769
01:26:44,988 --> 01:26:48,654
Frank, stop it! Stop it!

770
01:26:50,703 --> 01:26:53,276
Stop it, Frank!

771
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:03,288
In dreams you're mine

772
01:27:52,842 --> 01:27:54,041
Hit me.

773
01:28:18,657 --> 01:28:20,400
No, Donny, Mama loves you!

774
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:44,923
What do you mean,
you're lucky to be able to call me?

775
01:28:45,014 --> 01:28:46,805
Things got out of hand.

776
01:28:48,725 --> 01:28:53,886
I know some things. They could help your
father, but you might get into trouble.

777
01:28:54,356 --> 01:28:57,356
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

778
01:28:57,734 --> 01:29:01,684
OK. I promise I won't mention you.

779
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:05,986
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

780
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:09,992
- Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before.
- OK.

781
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:12,154
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
- Bye.

782
01:29:29,303 --> 01:29:30,964
I don't wanna talk about it.

783
01:29:31,056 --> 01:29:35,551
Everything is OK now.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

784
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:40,684
Sometimes it's good to talk things over.
For instance, they say many marriages...

785
01:29:40,772 --> 01:29:44,900
Aunt Barbara...
I love you but you're gonna get it.

786
01:30:16,638 --> 01:30:18,298
Gordon.

787
01:30:18,514 --> 01:30:22,678
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad
daylight, cos he's the man, right?

788
01:30:22,769 --> 01:30:26,896
He took those drugs away
and it was beautiful.

789
01:31:00,428 --> 01:31:02,504
I got it.

790
01:31:04,724 --> 01:31:07,842
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey.

791
01:31:09,686 --> 01:31:12,557
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hi, Jeffrey.

792
01:31:12,647 --> 01:31:17,854
- Sorry to bother you, but I need to talk.
- OK. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

793
01:31:17,944 --> 01:31:20,731
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.

794
01:31:25,992 --> 01:31:30,453
I have to show you some photos
and tell you some things about them.

795
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:35,947
This is the first picture.

796
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,419
It's Frank Booth.

797
01:31:40,213 --> 01:31:43,085
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

798
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:46,800
His address is on the back of the photo.

799
01:31:48,095 --> 01:31:53,682
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

800
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:15,745
And then that man came out and met
with a third man. This well-dressed guy.

801
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:18,664
Here's that photo.

802
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:26,795
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

803
01:32:26,881 --> 01:32:31,044
I think Frank kidnapped her husband
and son. I have no hard proof of this.

804
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:38,011
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

805
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:43,223
Who else knows you have these photos?

806
01:32:43,312 --> 01:32:46,681
Just you and the photo lab.

807
01:32:46,773 --> 01:32:50,059
- And you're through with this now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

808
01:32:53,822 --> 01:32:58,696
For now, all right, you better be. And
Sandy better not be involved with this.

809
01:33:03,956 --> 01:33:08,368
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

810
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:10,583
Yes, sir.

811
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:23,715
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. Is Friday still on?

812
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:27,674
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.

813
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,888
Why did I ever
get you going on this, Jeffrey?

814
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:38,486
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See ya then.

815
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:41,818
Good night, Detective Williams.

816
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:49,162
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

817
01:33:58,588 --> 01:34:00,664
Dad?

818
01:34:00,757 --> 01:34:02,465
What's wrong?

819
01:34:03,509 --> 01:34:06,048
There better be nothin' wrong.

820
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,808
- I'll get it.
- OK, thanks.

821
01:35:12,196 --> 01:35:14,604
- Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs Williams.

822
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:16,987
- She's all ready.
- OK.

823
01:35:18,577 --> 01:35:21,199
- You look great.
- Thanks.

824
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:25,160
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

825
01:35:25,251 --> 01:35:26,910
- You all set?
- Almost.

826
01:35:27,502 --> 01:35:30,171
Hey, John, get a move on.

827
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,250
Just a minute, Tom.

828
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:41,752
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

829
01:35:43,016 --> 01:35:46,468
Behave yourself. Don't blow it.

830
01:35:48,146 --> 01:35:50,981
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

831
01:35:51,065 --> 01:35:54,398
So long, Jeffrey.
You two have a nice time tonight, OK?

832
01:35:54,485 --> 01:35:57,105
- OK.
- What's goin' on?

833
01:35:57,195 --> 01:35:59,567
Just a little fatherly advice.

834
01:35:59,656 --> 01:36:01,648
That's right, Jeffrey.

835
01:36:01,742 --> 01:36:03,734
Come on.

836
01:36:03,827 --> 01:36:05,618
Bye, Dad.

837
01:36:05,703 --> 01:36:09,487
- Good night, Mom.
- Bye. Have a good time.

838
01:36:09,581 --> 01:36:12,582
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

839
01:36:18,757 --> 01:36:22,837
- Jeffrey, what was that all about?
- It's nothing.

840
01:36:22,928 --> 01:36:25,003
Really.

841
01:36:25,764 --> 01:36:27,838
It's good to see you.

842
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:30,756
It's good to see you.

843
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,015
You look beautiful.

844
01:36:41,861 --> 01:36:42,976
Thank you.

845
01:36:50,953 --> 01:36:53,028
Hi.

846
01:37:17,267 --> 01:37:19,758
- It's all taken care of.
- OK.

847
01:37:20,438 --> 01:37:22,097
You want a drink?

848
01:37:24,692 --> 01:37:26,979
Wanna dance?

849
01:37:28,111 --> 01:37:30,186
Yeah.

850
01:37:39,037 --> 01:37:46,167
Sometimes a wind blows

851
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:55,005
And you and I

852
01:37:55,595 --> 01:38:02,177
Float

853
01:38:02,768 --> 01:38:11,106
In love

854
01:38:11,775 --> 01:38:18,821
And kiss for ever

855
01:38:19,323 --> 01:38:26,655
In a darkness

856
01:38:27,998 --> 01:38:34,036
And the mysteries of love

857
01:38:34,129 --> 01:38:36,205
I love you, Jeffrey.

858
01:38:36,382 --> 01:38:40,081
Come clear

859
01:38:40,175 --> 01:38:42,667
I love you, too.

860
01:38:45,139 --> 01:38:51,223
In you

861
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:56,812
In me

862
01:38:57,316 --> 01:39:01,265
And show

863
01:39:01,361 --> 01:39:04,529
That we

864
01:39:05,407 --> 01:39:13,450
Are love

865
01:39:22,005 --> 01:39:24,710
Bye. See you later.

866
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:12,129
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

867
01:40:12,843 --> 01:40:14,550
They're gonna hit us.

868
01:40:16,054 --> 01:40:18,379
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

869
01:40:25,813 --> 01:40:27,474
Move it!

870
01:40:27,565 --> 01:40:29,640
Hang on.

871
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:35,729
I can't outrun this guy.
My father's got a gun at home.

872
01:40:35,823 --> 01:40:38,906
- Jeffrey, no.
- Sandy, this guy's a killer. I promise you.

873
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:47,661
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike.
Oh, my God.

874
01:40:55,841 --> 01:41:00,086
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

875
01:41:00,177 --> 01:41:03,510
You stole my girl, you bastard.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

876
01:41:03,597 --> 01:41:06,931
Right here, in front of your own
stupid house. Get outta here!

877
01:41:07,017 --> 01:41:08,676
Mike, stop it.

878
01:41:08,768 --> 01:41:13,097
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?
Nobody's talkin' to you.

879
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:16,689
Come on, Mike. Look, I don't
wanna cause any problems.

880
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:20,230
- Who's that? Is that your mother?
- Dorothy.

881
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,532
- No, come here, you lvy League shit.
- She's hurt, in case you didn't notice.

882
01:41:24,616 --> 01:41:27,107
Dorothy Vallens?

883
01:41:34,876 --> 01:41:36,833
Come on.

884
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,425
I'm really... Hey, I'm sorry.

885
01:41:50,681 --> 01:41:53,635
I'm really sorry.
I didn't know. I'm really sorry.

886
01:41:53,726 --> 01:41:57,510
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

887
01:41:57,813 --> 01:41:59,555
We've gotta get her outta here.

888
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:02,648
Go to my house.
My father can get an ambulance fast.

889
01:42:02,733 --> 01:42:06,233
- His partner won't be there, will he?
- Probably not. Why?

890
01:42:06,321 --> 01:42:09,486
- Nothing.
- Watch out for Mike.

891
01:42:11,074 --> 01:42:13,151
Oh, God.

892
01:42:13,243 --> 01:42:15,319
Is that you, Jeffrey?

893
01:42:15,788 --> 01:42:17,697
Yeah. It's me.

894
01:42:17,789 --> 01:42:19,745
Oh, Jeffrey...

895
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,283
Jeffrey...

896
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:31,081
Dad? Mom?

897
01:42:31,426 --> 01:42:34,297
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom!

898
01:42:34,388 --> 01:42:36,843
All right, I'll be right there.

899
01:42:36,932 --> 01:42:41,011
- Is Dad home?
- No. He oughta...

900
01:42:41,227 --> 01:42:44,263
You better call him.
And... get an ambulance.

901
01:42:44,355 --> 01:42:46,430
Where have you been?

902
01:42:46,523 --> 01:42:48,599
Oh, God.

903
01:42:48,858 --> 01:42:54,279
Oh, God, they've hurt him.
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

904
01:42:54,364 --> 01:42:56,689
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

905
01:43:02,538 --> 01:43:04,613
My secret lover.

906
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:09,660
I've called for an ambulance.
The police are on their way.

907
01:43:09,752 --> 01:43:11,543
Don't get the police!

908
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:14,589
Stop it!

909
01:43:15,383 --> 01:43:17,375
I love you! Love me!

910
01:43:20,887 --> 01:43:22,963
He put his disease in me.

911
01:43:23,849 --> 01:43:28,178
Tell me it's all right
I opened myself to you.

912
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:31,969
- Tell me it's all right.
- Sandy, please...

913
01:43:32,064 --> 01:43:35,397
- Sandy?
- I'll get a coat to put on her.

914
01:43:39,445 --> 01:43:42,530
Jeffrey? What's going on here?

915
01:43:42,615 --> 01:43:44,941
I'll tell you.

916
01:43:45,034 --> 01:43:48,368
They... they've hurt his head.

917
01:43:49,371 --> 01:43:51,448
Who, Dorothy?

918
01:43:52,124 --> 01:43:55,208
Don. Help him.

919
01:43:57,213 --> 01:43:58,706
Help him.

920
01:44:00,131 --> 01:44:02,705
Promise me you'll help him!

921
01:44:12,976 --> 01:44:15,514
He put his disease in me.

922
01:44:34,245 --> 01:44:36,819
Would you like to
come in the ambulance?

923
01:44:36,915 --> 01:44:38,989
I'll be right with you.

924
01:44:47,049 --> 01:44:48,922
I should go.

925
01:44:49,009 --> 01:44:51,084
- Go.
- Sandy...

926
01:44:59,559 --> 01:45:01,885
Hold me! I'm falling!

927
01:45:01,979 --> 01:45:04,814
I'm falling! Hold me!

928
01:45:11,613 --> 01:45:16,819
- You lied to me.
- Sandy, please, forgive me.

929
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,866
I love you.

930
01:45:19,953 --> 01:45:22,526
I forgive you, Jeffrey.

931
01:45:27,752 --> 01:45:29,828
I love you.

932
01:45:33,966 --> 01:45:36,042
I love you.

933
01:45:38,096 --> 01:45:41,926
I... But I couldn't watch that.

934
01:45:47,938 --> 01:45:50,938
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, she's OK.

935
01:45:51,023 --> 01:45:54,806
Get your father. Tell him to send
the police to Dorothy's apartment.

936
01:45:54,902 --> 01:45:57,475
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

937
01:45:57,571 --> 01:46:00,239
- Jeffrey, no.
- I have to.

938
01:46:01,074 --> 01:46:03,695
- I love you.
- Oh, God, be careful.

939
01:46:03,785 --> 01:46:05,860
I will, believe me.

940
01:46:17,297 --> 01:46:19,372
Where...

941
01:46:22,051 --> 01:46:24,542
Where is my dream?

942
01:46:38,066 --> 01:46:40,141
Look, this is an emergency.

943
01:46:40,234 --> 01:46:44,694
He said someone was hurt
and he wants Detective Williams there.

944
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:47,485
We do not know his whereabouts
at this time.

945
01:46:47,574 --> 01:46:48,689
Well, find him!

946
01:48:47,266 --> 01:48:49,424
Get back and stay down.

947
01:48:52,312 --> 01:48:54,553
He's going to apartment 26.

948
01:48:56,316 --> 01:49:01,439
Lieutenant, we're at Frank's place now.
The raid has commenced, as scheduled.

949
01:49:05,407 --> 01:49:07,898
Stay in place.

950
01:49:08,285 --> 01:49:12,032
Love letters straight from your heart

951
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:15,869
Number 25 is vacant,
so maybe we can go through there.

952
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,827
Keep us so near

953
01:49:22,713 --> 01:49:24,623
While apart

954
01:49:30,596 --> 01:49:33,265
I'm not alone

955
01:49:33,765 --> 01:49:37,135
In the night

956
01:49:39,688 --> 01:49:41,763
I'm gonna let them find you on their own.

957
01:49:41,856 --> 01:49:44,940
When I can have

958
01:49:45,026 --> 01:49:48,110
All the love

959
01:49:48,195 --> 01:49:51,729
You write

960
01:49:53,116 --> 01:49:55,987
I memorise

961
01:49:56,787 --> 01:49:58,614
Every line

962
01:51:44,717 --> 01:51:46,294
Detective Williams.

963
01:51:46,386 --> 01:51:50,169
- Detective Williams?
- Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

964
01:51:50,264 --> 01:51:53,597
Yeah, it's me. I'm hiding
in Dorothy Vallens' apartment.

965
01:51:53,684 --> 01:51:58,476
Frank is on his way in a well-dressed-man
disguise. I've got no way out...

966
01:51:59,356 --> 01:52:00,766
He's got a radio.

967
01:52:02,608 --> 01:52:03,639
Jeffrey!

968
01:52:07,822 --> 01:52:12,198
Detective Williams?
I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

969
01:52:12,283 --> 01:52:14,359
Please hurry.

970
01:52:26,797 --> 01:52:33,166
Hey, neighbour. You shit-for-brains, man!
You forgot I have a police radio!

971
01:52:36,932 --> 01:52:43,383
One well-dressed fuckin' man knows
where your fuckin' cute little butt's hidin'.

972
01:52:44,354 --> 01:52:46,430
Stupid fuck.

973
01:52:47,691 --> 01:52:49,897
Fuck with me, man.

974
01:53:00,911 --> 01:53:05,074
Here I come, ready or not.

975
01:53:11,003 --> 01:53:13,458
You fuck!

976
01:53:13,548 --> 01:53:17,497
I can hear your fuckin' radio,
you stupid shit!

977
01:53:18,219 --> 01:53:23,045
You got about one fuckin'
second to live, buddy!

978
01:53:23,139 --> 01:53:27,219
You're one sorry piece of shit, mister.

979
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:36,894
Hey, pretty, pretty!

980
01:53:45,451 --> 01:53:49,200
What the fuck... Where are you?
Where are you?

981
01:54:57,266 --> 01:54:59,472
Oh, Jeffrey.

982
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:10,099
It's all over, Jeffrey.

983
01:55:52,941 --> 01:56:00,236
And kiss for ever

984
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:07,785
In a darkness

985
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:16,667
And the mysteries of love

986
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:25,801
Come clear

987
01:56:25,887 --> 01:56:32,968
And dance

988
01:56:34,269 --> 01:56:41,103
In light

989
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:44,604
In you

990
01:56:45,446 --> 01:56:49,065
- Jeffrey, lunch is ready.
- OK.

991
01:56:51,077 --> 01:56:54,659
In me

992
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:58,871
And show

993
01:56:59,168 --> 01:57:00,626
That we...

994
01:57:00,711 --> 01:57:03,331
- How you guys doin'?
- Hey, Jeffrey.

995
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:08,166
- Hey, Jeff. Feelin' much better now, Jeff.
- Good deal, Dad.

996
01:57:10,303 --> 01:57:12,758
Sandy, look.

997
01:57:18,185 --> 01:57:19,382
Lunchtime.

998
01:57:19,478 --> 01:57:21,601
- OK, Jeffrey.
- Sounds good.

999
01:57:21,688 --> 01:57:25,270
Jeffrey, come over here and look at this.

1000
01:57:26,442 --> 01:57:28,482
Look.

1001
01:57:29,069 --> 01:57:31,525
Yeah, I saw him outside.

1002
01:57:32,156 --> 01:57:34,728
Maybe the robins are here.

1003
01:57:36,075 --> 01:57:40,655
I don't see how they could do that.
I could never eat a bug.

1004
01:57:43,123 --> 01:57:45,697
It's a strange world.

1005
01:57:46,252 --> 01:57:48,328
Isn't it?

1006
01:57:53,508 --> 01:58:00,175
Sometimes a wind blows

1007
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:08,388
And the mysteries of love

1008
01:58:09,106 --> 01:58:16,815
Come clear

1009
01:58:41,886 --> 01:58:47,638
And I still can see

1010
01:58:47,724 --> 01:58:51,093
Blue velvet

1011
01:58:52,353 --> 01:58:54,678
Through

1012
01:58:54,771 --> 01:58:57,060
My

1013
01:58:57,149 --> 01:59:01,313
Tears
