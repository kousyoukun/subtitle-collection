1
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:53,194
Blue velvet

2
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,362
Whoa- Whoa

3
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:06,413
她穿着蓝丝绒
She wore blue velvet

4
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:06,172
Whoa- Whoa

5
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:11,418
蓝得比夜晚还要蓝
Bluer than velvet was the night

6
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:11,926
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

7
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,364
柔软得比星星的光还要柔软
Softer than satin was the light

8
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:21,399
柔软得比星星的光还要柔软
From the stars

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,436
她穿着蓝丝绒
She wore blue velvet

10
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:35,442
蓝得比她的双眼还要蓝
Whoa- Whoa

11
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:32,943
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

12
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,857
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

13
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:39,948
温暖得比她的柔情还要温暖
Warmer than May her tender sighs

14
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,656
我们的爱
Love was ours

15
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:51,760
我是如此珍惜那份爱
Ours a love I held tightly

16
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:57,465
对她愈来愈迷恋
Feeling the rapture grow

17
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:03,469
像是火焰发出光芒
Like a flame burning brightly

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,774
但是当她离去…
But when she left

19
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:14,780
蓝丝绒的光芒也消失
Gone was the glow of blue velvet

20
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,526
Whoa- Whoa

21
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:20,788
只有在我心中她们常在
But in my heart there'll always be

22
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:21,108
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

23
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,793
珍贵地保有这份回忆
Precious and warm a memory

24
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,799
年复一年…
Through the years...

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,401
砍伐，砍伐，砍伐
Logs, logs, logs

26
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,337
丛林中如此喧嚣
Glamour in the pines

27
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,068
伐木镇
Lumberton

28
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,807
美国
USA

29
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,146
今天的伐木镇又是阳光明媚的一天
It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton, so get those chain saws out.

30
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,174
大伙又可以带着电锯出门砍伐了

31
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,517
这里是WOOD电台…
This is the mighty W-O-O-D, the musical voice of Lumberton.

32
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,385
伐木镇的音乐之声

33
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,254
大树倒下的声音响起时…
At the sound of the falling tree...

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,228
现在是九点三十分
it's 9.30!

35
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,163
茂盛的丛林中还有众多的树木等着被砍倒
There's a whole lotta wood Waitin' out there, so let's get goin'.

36
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,257
让我们继续努力吧

37
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,559
博蒙特先生
Mr Beaumont?

38
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,123
你儿子杰弗里来看你了
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

39
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,743
嗨，爸爸
Hey, Dad.

40
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,647
（ 伐木镇警察局 ）

41
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,923
你好，请问威廉斯探长还在吗？
Do you have a Detective Williams still working here?

42
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,590
在，就在楼上221室
Yes, he's up in room 221.

43
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,360
穿过那扇门上楼就是
- Right up the stairs, through that door. - Thanks.

44
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,958
谢谢

45
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,541
威廉斯探长？
Detective Williams?

46
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,054
什么事？
Yes?

47
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,560
我叫杰弗里博蒙特，就住在你家附近
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near you. I believe you know my father Tom?

48
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,959
我想你该认识我父亲

49
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,964
汤姆博蒙特，博蒙特五金店的老板
- Beaumont's Hardware Store? - Sure I do. I hear he's in the hospital.

50
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,466
当然认识，听说他进了医院

51
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,694
身体怎样了？
- How's he doing? - Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.

52
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,260
我想该是没事了，希望如此吧

53
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:55,101
他们还在给他做检查，因此我就休学回家了
They're doing tests. I was at the hospital this morning

54
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,937
我今早看完他回来
and, coming home through the field behind Vista,

55
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,442
在穿过邻居家后面荒地的时候

56
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,877
在穿过邻居家后面荒地的时候

57
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,939
我发现了一只耳朵
I... found an ear.

58
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:07,247
什么？是人耳吗？
You did? A human ear?

59
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,914
我觉得该拿来给你看看
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

60
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,788
你做得很对，让我来瞧瞧
Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

61
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:20,523
确实是人耳
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

62
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,694
先把这拿到验尸官那儿去
Let's see what the coroner makes of it.

63
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,363
然后你再带我去现场
Then I want you to show me exactly where you found it.

64
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:27,632
好
All right.

65
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,306
我们会去查陈尸房的记录
We'll check the morgue records, but I don't recall anything minus an ear.

66
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,642
可我不记得有什么尸体少了耳朵

67
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,945
耳朵的主人可能还活着
The person may very well still be alive somewhere.

68
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,781
从这耳朵能知道它主人的身份吗？
What can you tell about the person from the ear?

69
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,515
得先做大量的化验…
Once the tests are done, quite a lot.

70
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:47,321
鉴别性别、血型，还要看是否死后才割下来的
Sex, blood type, whether the ear came off a dead person.

71
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,126
此外…这看来…像是被剪刀剪下来的
Also, it looks like the ear was cut off with scissors.

72
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,555
我想出去走走
- I'm goin' out for a while. - Do you want the car?

73
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,062
想要用车？
- No, I'm just gonna walk around. - All right.

74
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,622
不，只是随便走走　　　好吧

75
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,157
你不会去林肯街吧？
You're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

76
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,830
不，我就在附近走走
No, just around the neighbourhood. Don't worry.

77
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,372
别担心

78
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,872
好吧，亲爱的
OK, honey.

79
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,016
你好，我是杰弗里博蒙特
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams here?

80
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,642
威廉斯探长在吗？
- Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in. - Thanks.

81
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,654
他在，进来吧，杰弗里

82
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,178
多谢

83
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,629
杰弗里，你找到的东西很有意思
Well, Jeffrey, you found something very interesting.

84
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,224
非常有意思
Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.

85
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,566
我明白你定想多了解些情况

86
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,731
但恐怕我得请你严守秘密
But I have to ask you not only not to tell anybody about your find,

87
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,706
但恐怕我得请你严守秘密

88
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,233
而且也别再插手这案件了
but also not to ask more about the case.

89
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,542
等到水落石出的那天
One day when it's all sewed up,

90
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,243
我一定会告诉你全部细节
I'll let you know all the details.

91
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,752
可是现在还不行
Right now, though, I can't.

92
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:29,253
我明白
I understand. I'm just real curious, like you said.

93
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,257
我只不过是很好奇罢了

94
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,421
我年轻的时候也和你一样
I was the same way myself when I was your age.

95
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:39,294
所以后来才做了这行
- That's what got me into this business. - Must be great.

96
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,595
感觉一定很棒

97
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,500
但也很可怕
It's horrible, too.

98
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,036
我很抱歉，杰弗里
I'm sorry, Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be.

99
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:47,868
事情只能是这样了

100
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:51,375
我想你明白我的苦衷
Anyway, I know you do understand.

101
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,968
是的
Sure.

102
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,915
谢谢你帮我父亲的忙
- Thanks for the card for Dad. - You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

103
00:11:57,949 --> 00:11:59,109
不用客气

104
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,550
能认识你真不错，杰弗里
You, too.

105
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,075
我也是

106
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,816
请代我向桑蒂问好　　　好
- Say hello to Sandy for me. - We will.

107
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,156
晚安，杰弗里
- Good night, Jeffrey. - Good night.

108
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,857
晚安，威廉斯探长

109
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,775
耳朵是你找到的？
Are you the one that found the ear?

110
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,889
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

111
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,231
我就是知道
I just know, that's all.

112
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,139
我在学校见过你
- I remember you from Central. - Are you a senior?

113
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,304
是吗？你读四年级？　　对

114
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,643
最近学校怎么样？
Yup.

115
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,594
- How is Central these days? - Terrible.

116
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,047
很糟糕，无聊的很
- I don't know... Boring. - What else is new!

117
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,516
没新鲜的事了，对吗？

118
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,576
是的，你最近如何？
So what are you doin' now?

119
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,021
我暂时休学，父亲住院了
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

120
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,388
太可惜了
- That's too bad. - Yeah.

121
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,087
是啊，你怎么知道耳朵的事情？
What do you know about the ear?

122
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,221
我爸不是已经叫你少管了吗？
- Didn't Dad say not to talk about it? - Yeah, but you brought it up.

123
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,094
对，可是你先说起的

124
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,429
你知道些什么吗？
You know anything?

125
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,094
知道得不多，零零碎碎的
I don't know much but bits and pieces. I hear things.

126
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,196
我对此有些耳闻
Yeah?

127
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,832
我房间的楼下就是父亲的书房
- My room is above my father's office so... - Above your father's office?

128
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,899
在他书房的上面？

129
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,377
所以我就听到了点关于耳朵的事
- So I heard a few things about the ear. - Uh-huh. And?

130
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,710
是什么？
Well... there are a couple of cases I get mixed up on.

131
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:39,774
还有些案子好像也与此有关

132
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,480
那有一个女歌手
But one name that keeps coming up is this woman singer.

133
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,045
她就在你家附近租了公寓
She lives in an apartment real close to your house.

134
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,182
她就在你家附近租了公寓

135
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,784
也靠近那片荒地
Close to the field where you found the ear.

136
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,728
这世界无奇不有，不是吗？
It's a strange world, isn't it?

137
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,253
是啊
- Yeah. - Where is this apartment?

138
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,095
知道那女人的家在哪吗？
It's really close by. That's what's so creepy.

139
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,567
离这儿很近，那街区很乱

140
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,900
他们已经监视她好几个月
They had her under surveillance,

141
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,495
我也不知道他们有何收获
'cept I don't know what they found out cos she's not my dad's case. So...

142
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,440
因为那案子不归我爸管

143
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,877
我想你还不急着回家吧
I guess you gotta get back home pretty soon, huh?

144
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,040
不急，有什么事？
Not really. Why?

145
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,174
好吧…
Well...

146
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,412
你想去见见那屋子
- You... wanna see the building. - Yeah.

147
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,354
没错　　　来吧，我带你去
- Come on, I'll show you. - OK.

148
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,951
嗨，宝贝
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,332
就是那栋
That's her building right there.

150
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,461
她住在七楼
She lives on the seventh floor.

151
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,044
走吧
Come on.

152
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,879
（ 林肯街 ）

153
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:58,956
那你如今在家都做些什么？
So... what are you gonna do now that you're home?

154
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,898
帮着打理家里的五金店
Help out at my father's hardware store.

155
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:05,130
有自由时间，还算不错
They're giving me my own hours, which is nice.

156
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,434
我曾和住这家的孩子很熟
I used to know a kid that lived there.

157
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,171
他是我见过说话最结巴的家伙
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

158
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,046
后来他怎么样了？
What happened to him?

159
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,213
不知道，搬走了吧
I don't know. He moved away.

160
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,948
所有的老朋友都走光了
All my old friends are gone.

161
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,430
知道我们怎么学鸡走吗？
- You know the chicken walk? - What's that?

162
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,954
怎么样？

163
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,937
那可真有趣
That's kind of interesting.

164
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,385
该休息啦
Coffee time.

165
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:06,488
是艾德兄弟啊，那些防护服呢？
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

166
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,625
在架子的底部
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up, where they've always been.

167
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,499
就在平时摆放的地方

168
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,130
来，艾德，猜猜是几个手指？
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

169
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:16,467
四个
Four.

170
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,040
我总搞不明白你是怎么办到的
I still don't know how you do that.

171
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,572
需要我帮忙喷杀虫水吗？
Now listen. You sure you don't need me or this rig for a while?

172
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,641
除非你想要应付那些虫子，杰弗里…
If you wanna spray for bugs, Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

173
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,619
我们是无所谓的

174
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,553
没问题
Okey-dokey, Double Ed.

175
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,252
见到你回来真好　　　是啊
- Oh, it's so good to have you back. - Yeah, sure.

176
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:58,682
你是饿了？渴了？或者两者皆是
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

177
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,617
我不知道
- I don't know. - I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.

178
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,143
我想要和你谈谈

179
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,089
稍等
Wait just a minute.

180
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,628
你们可千万别告诉麦克
Listen. Don't you guys dare say anything to Mike.

181
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,290
好的　　　事情不是你们想的那样
- Sure. - It's not what you think, OK?

182
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:15,891
你们保证？好的
- Promise? - Whatever you say.

183
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,372
我可不想惹什么麻烦
- I don't wanna cause trouble. - I'm here, aren't I?

184
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,633
我这不是来了吧
- He is nice-lookin'. - Yeah.

185
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:25,005
他真英俊

186
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,715
去过亚琳餐厅吗？
You ever been to Arlene's?

187
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,240
当然
Of course.

188
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,260
你还没说出你的来意
Now are you gonna tell me why we're here?

189
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:59,599
生命中有很多获得磨练，增长阅历的机会
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience.

190
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:04,514
有时候也需要冒险
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

191
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:05,914
我在想的是…
I'll bet someone could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment.

192
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,349
若是能潜入那女人的公寓

193
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,182
收获肯定不小

194
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,678
偷偷溜进去，藏好，再观察
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

195
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,387
溜进她的住处？对
- Sneak into her apartment? - Yeah.

196
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,419
你这是疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

197
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,931
杰弗里，她也许和凶杀案有关
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder. This is givin' me the creeps.

198
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,933
这想法太可怕了
Now just settle down. I have a plan which I think will work.

199
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,434
先安心听我说

200
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,460
我有个可行的计划

201
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:27,971
虽然不怎么费事
There's very little for you to do, but I do need your help.

202
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,507
但却需要你帮忙

203
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,544
你连听听都不愿意吗？
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

204
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:36,046
你愿意说就说
Tell me any plan you want, but it's not going any further than this diner.

205
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,049
但这就和这顿午餐一样，毫无意义

206
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,608
桑蒂
Sandy,

207
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,779
别用这种态度嘛
don't take that attitude.

208
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,119
好了
All right. The first thing I need is to get into her apartment

209
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,183
首先我要进入她的公寓…

210
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,661
打开扇窗子，以便以后进去
- And open a window to crawl into later. - How are you gonna do that?

211
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,254
怎么进去？
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

212
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,526
在外面的车上

213
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,967
我有些旧防护服及杀虫剂

214
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,061
我去她公寓假装来喷杀虫剂
I will go to her apartment as a pest-control man. I will spray her apartment.

215
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,437
我去她公寓假装来喷杀虫剂

216
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,875
几分钟后你去敲门吸引她的注意
You knock on the door, draw her attention away from me, and I'll jimmy a window.

217
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,468
几分钟后你去敲门吸引她的注意

218
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,274
我就趁机撬开窗子

219
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,010
那她来应门的时候我该说什么？
- And what do I say to her at the door? - You will be a Jehovah's witness.

220
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,575
你就装成是传教的

221
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:18,053
我为你准备了些《觉醒》之类的杂志
I have some Awake!  magazines for you.

222
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:21,555
不需要太多时间，几分钟而已
I don't need very much time, just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?

223
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,753
你看如何？

224
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,592
不知道
I don't know.

225
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,723
听起来像是个漂亮的白日梦
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream, but... actually doing it's too weird.

226
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,725
但实在是太怪异了

227
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,294
这么做太危险
- It's too dangerous. - Sandy, let's just try the first part.

228
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,840
桑蒂，先试试看吧

229
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:44,105
没有人会怀疑我们
No one will suspect us.

230
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,582
他们不会想到有人会那么疯狂
No one would think two people like us would be crazy enough to do this.

231
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,780
他们不会想到有人会那么疯狂

232
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,448
说的有理
You have a point there.

233
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,388
（ 深河公寓 ）

234
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,035
我进门后，过三分钟你再来
Give me at least three minutes.

235
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,571
我可以拖延下时间
I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window. All right?

236
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:10,699
但得给我时间找合适的窗子

237
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,367
好吧
All right.

238
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,910
走
Let's go.

239
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,825
我先上去了
Here I go.

240
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,386
等等，她叫什么名字来着？
Wait a minute. What's her name?

241
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,058
天啊，杰弗里
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

242
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,660
桃乐茜华伦，七楼
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

243
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,933
查她信箱可以知道房间号
Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy.

244
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,137
多谢
Thanks.

245
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,674
桃乐茜华伦，七楼
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

246
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,230
OK. Good luck.

247
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,916
祝你好运
Good luck yourself.

248
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,942
还是祝你自己吧

249
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,018
三分钟后再来，别太早了
Three minutes. No sooner.

250
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,379
（ 电梯已坏，请用楼梯 ）

251
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,898
请问有什么事？
Yes? What is it?

252
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,423
公司派我来杀虫
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

253
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,836
杀虫剂的味道很难闻
- That stuff stinks. - This is new stuff. There's no smell.

254
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,898
这是新型药剂，无味的

255
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,307
那就好
Good.

256
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,318
只需在厨房喷点就可以了
Just need to do the kitchen.

257
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,910
来的人还真多
Grand Central Station.

258
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:00,297
只不过是个杀虫的
It's only the bug man.

259
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,858
那样就差不多了
- That should do it. - Yeah?

260
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,074
你没事吧？你那儿出了什么问题？
- Are you all right? - Yeah. What happened?

261
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:43,137
我刚要来敲门，却被那人抢先一步
I was about to go to the door when that guy did it for me.

262
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,307
没出事吧？
- Was it all right? - Yes and no. Did you recognise him?

263
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:46,339
很难说，你认得那个人吗？

264
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,045
我只看到他背面
I only saw his back. I think he went out a door at the end of the hall.

265
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,714
他好像是从另外的门离开的

266
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,222
我也没能怎么仔细打量他
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me.

267
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:53,655
可他把我看了个仔仔细细
I didn't have time to get a window, but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?

268
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:56,558
没时间去搞开窗子，但我找到了些钥匙

269
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,186
干得很漂亮吧
Yeah, if they open the door.

270
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:00,197
得能开得了门再说

271
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,664
对
Yeah.

272
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,584
那接下来该去干什么？
So, what's next?

273
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,145
你还想玩下去吗？
- Are you game for more? - I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

274
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,521
我把这事搞砸了，算我欠你的

275
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:29,150
你没搞砸什么
You didn't goof it up. But... you still owe me one.

276
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,184
但还是欠我一次

277
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:39,926
今晚上溜进去？
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

278
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,675
今晚是周末，有约会吗？
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

279
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:48,041
是的，我有
Yeah. I do.

280
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:57,153
好吧，没戏唱了
Well, that does that.

281
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,593
你不会真想去干吧？
- You really wanna do this, don't you? - I don't want you to get involved.

282
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,639
我不想连累你

283
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:18,107
我要去，若是出了事
I do, but if something went wrong...

284
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:20,633
如你所说，这可能牵扯到凶杀案
Like you said, they may be involved in murder.

285
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:30,617
那我就和麦克说我病了
OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

286
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:34,614
丑话说在前面
Just so the record is kept straight, though,

287
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,650
我爱麦克
I love Mike.

288
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,161
你要我怎么做？
What do you want me to do?

289
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:47,660
我们先去吃顿丰盛的晚餐
First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.

290
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,763
再打听桃乐茜华伦在哪唱歌

291
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,934
我知道，是在七区的史洛俱乐部
I already know. The Slow Club on Route 7.

292
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,308
太好了，我八点来接你？
Great. I'll pick you up about eight?

293
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:58,509
不用接我了，否则我爸会起疑心
Don't pick me up. My dad might think it's strange.

294
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,073
我会走路去你家
I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

295
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,779
八点到好吗？

296
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,118
趁现在没人你快走吧
You better get out before someone sees us.

297
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,121
晚上见
See ya!

298
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:38,245
（ 史洛俱乐部 ）

299
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,049
对了
Wait. Here's to an interesting experience, huh?

300
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,619
为这有趣的体验干杯

301
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,654
干杯
I'll drink to that.

302
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:57,140
我很喜欢喜力啤酒，你喜欢吗？
Man, I like Heineken! You like Heineken?

303
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,177
之前从未尝过
- I never really had Heineken before. - You never had Heineken before?

304
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,111
你没喝过喜力啤酒？

305
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:04,137
我父亲喜欢喝巴德牌
My dad drinks Bud.

306
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,078
那可是啤酒之王
- King of beers. - Ladies and gentlemen,

307
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,177
女士们先生们

308
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,188
接下来表演的是蓝夜之后…
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

309
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,213
桃乐茜华伦小姐

310
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:33,303
她
She

311
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,676
穿着
Wore

312
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:46,986
蓝丝绒
Blue velvet

313
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:55,825
蓝的比夜晚还要蓝
Bluer than velvet was the night

314
00:28:55,866 --> 00:29:01,668
柔软得比星星的光还要柔软
Softer than satin was the light

315
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:05,573
柔软得比星星的光还要柔软
From the stars

316
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:18,253
她穿着蓝丝绒
She wore blue velvet

317
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:25,989
蓝得比她双眼还要蓝
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

318
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:30,727
那影子
Shadows

319
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:36,035
如此的蓝
Fall so blue

320
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:44,371
就如那孤寂的
As lonely as a blue

321
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,542
蓝色
Blue

322
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:51,419
星星
Star

323
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,947
杰弗里，你不该这么做
- Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this. - Why not?

324
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,414
为什么？

325
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,509
因为这太疯狂…
Cos it's crazy... and dangerous.

326
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:23,076
又危险

327
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,714
我真不该告诉你的
- My God, I should have never told you. - I'll be all right.

328
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:27,087
不会有事的
I don't think you should stay. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?

329
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,682
我想你还是先回家吧

330
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,160
能开这车吗？

331
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,924
能，但是…
- Yeah, but I... - Leave it in front of your house, OK?

332
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:35,955
就把它停在你家门口，我会去拿的

333
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,763
好吧
OK.

334
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,930
明天会告诉你事情经过
I'll see ya tomorrow and I'll tell ya how it went.

335
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,372
明天我不能来见你
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

336
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:46,467
麦克会来我家
- Mike's coming over. - OK. Can I call you?

337
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,672
那我能给你电话吗？

338
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:52,978
可以
OK, yeah, call.

339
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,008
希望你进得去还出得来
I hope you sneak out OK.

340
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,390
我会在这儿等到她回来
- I'm gonna wait here until she comes. - Sandy...

341
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:05,088
她来了我就按四下喇叭
I'm gonna honk four times.

342
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:09,657
节奏就是：一，二，三，四
I'll go one, two, three, four, and then you'll hear it

343
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,362
那样你就知道她上来了
- And you'll know she's on her way up. - OK.

344
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:21,274
真搞不懂你是大侦探还是变态
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.

345
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,008
我自己也想搞明白，走着瞧吧
Well, that's for me to know and you to find out.

346
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,520
再见
See ya.

347
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:42,725
再见
Bye.

348
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,873
喝太多啤酒了
Heineken.

349
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:33,595
希望你平安无事，杰弗里
I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.

350
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:54,989
谢谢你，吉米，明天见
Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow. Good night.

351
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,754
晚安

352
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,723
喂？是的，先生
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank? Frank, let me talk to him.

353
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,057
弗兰克？弗兰克，让我和他说说话

354
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,258
求求你了，弗兰克
Please, Frank... sir.

355
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,595
我喜欢唱“蓝丝绒”
I like to sing "Blue Velvet".

356
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,840
唐尼，没事的，别担心
Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry. Don! Don, can you hear me?

357
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,900
唐尼，听到我说话吗？

358
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,468
小唐尼没事吧？
Is little Donny all right?

359
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,413
他和你在一起吗？
Is he there with you?

360
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,786
唐尼？
Don?

361
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,623
你是说牧场路？
You mean Meadow Lane? Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

362
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:06,186
弗兰克，他怎么了？

363
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,859
我知道，我会乖乖的
I know. I'll be sweet.

364
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,300
妈妈爱你
Mommy loves you.

365
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,507
好的，弗兰克，先生
OK, Frank... sir.

366
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:29,828
快给我出来！出来！
Get out of there! Get out!

367
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,172
把手举起来！把手放在头上！快！
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

368
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,179
跪下来！
Get on your knees! Do it!

369
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,180
你来这儿干什么？
What are you doing?

370
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,979
你是谁？叫什么名字？
- Who are you? What's your name? - Jeffrey.

371
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,280
杰弗里
- Jeffrey what? - Jeffrey nothing.

372
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,581
姓什么？

373
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,814
就是杰弗里

374
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:49,484
把你的钱包给我
Give me your wallet. Give me your wallet!

375
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,799
“杰弗里博蒙特”
Jeffrey Beaumont. What are you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

376
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,962
你闯进我家干什么，杰弗里博蒙特？

377
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,903
我想来看你
- I wanted to see you. - Are you kidding?

378
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,305
开什么玩笑？

379
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:07,139
谁派你来的？没人派我来
- Who sent you here? - Nobody.

380
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:08,940
我好像见过你
- I've seen you before. - I sprayed your apartment.

381
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,039
我来你家里喷杀虫水，然后拿走了你的钥匙
I took your key. I didn't mean to do anything except see you.

382
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:14,312
我什么也不想做，只想看看你而已

383
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,411
那你今晚看到了什么？
What did you see, tonight?

384
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:19,012
说！
- Tell me! - I saw you come in, talk on the phone...

385
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,616
我看见你进来然后接电话

386
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:22,920
接下来呢？
- And then? - You got undressed.

387
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,518
你脱掉了衣服

388
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,395
你喜欢摸进女生的家里
Do you sneak in girls' apartments to see them get undressed?

389
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,229
偷看她们换衣服吗？

390
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,531
不，以前从未这样
No, never before this.

391
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:36,003
脱衣服，让我看
- Get undressed. I want to see you. - Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

392
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,768
对不起，放我走吧
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

393
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:40,674
不行！我要看你脱衣服

394
00:39:58,595 --> 00:39:59,994
站起来
Stand up.

395
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,375
过来
Come closer.

396
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,389
再近些
Closer.

397
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:37,789
你想要做什么？
What do you want?

398
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,401
我不知道
I don't know.

399
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,113
别动
Don't move. Don't look at me.

400
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,418
也别看我

401
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:13,325
你喜欢这样吗？是的
- Do you like that? - Yes.

402
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,541
别碰我！不然我杀了你！
Don't touch me! Or I'll kill you!

403
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:22,044
你喜欢我这样子说话吗？
Do you like talk like that?

404
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,013
不
No.

405
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:29,777
过去沙发那边
Get over there on that couch.

406
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,650
躺下
Lie down.

407
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,180
闭上嘴，别出声
Shut up! Don't say anything. Hide in the closet.

408
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,647
快回衣柜里去
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you. I mean it.

409
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,479
不许出声，不然我杀了你

410
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:01,814
我不开玩笑

411
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,912
你好，宝贝
- Hello, baby. - Shut up!

412
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,476
住嘴！叫我爸爸！
It's Daddy, you shithead! Where's my bourbon?

413
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,011
我的酒呢？

414
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,990
你他妈怎么那么没记性？
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

415
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:00,503
现在天黑了
Now it's dark.

416
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,580
把腿分开
Spread your legs.

417
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:23,063
再开点
Wider.

418
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:28,303
给我看
Now show it to me.

419
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,392
不许看着老子
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

420
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:21,279
妈妈
Mommy...

421
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:30,626
妈妈
Mommy! Mommy!

422
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,798
- Mommy... - Mommy loves you, Frank.

423
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,268
妈妈爱你

424
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,807
宝宝想要做爱
Baby wants to fuck!

425
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:44,812
快让我干！你这婊子！
All right, get ready to fuck! You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

426
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,213
婊子！

427
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:51,483
他妈不许看着老子！
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

428
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,819
好

429
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,205
宝宝想要蓝丝绒
Baby wants blue velvet.

430
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,140
妈妈，妈妈

431
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:37,094
不许看老子！
Don't you fuckin' look at me! Don't you fuckin' look at me!

432
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,661
不许看我
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

433
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,435
爸爸回家了

434
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:50,235
爸爸回家了
Daddy's comin' home.

435
00:45:52,615 --> 00:45:54,981
你他妈不许看老子！
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

436
00:45:57,954 --> 00:45:59,945
爸爸回家了
Daddy's comin' home.

437
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,226
爸爸回家了！

438
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:16,555
Mommy! Mommy!

439
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,791
你他妈不许看老子！
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

440
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,830
你他妈不许看老子！
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

441
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:02,609
现在天黑了
Now it's dark.

442
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,268
你得活下去，宝贝
You stay alive, baby.

443
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:23,568
这是为了梵高

444
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:24,913
Do it for Van Gogh.

445
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,075
为何不躺下来？
Why don't you lie down?

446
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:03,912
来，我来帮你
Come on, I'll help you.

447
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:15,583
我不要盖
I don't like that.

448
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,593
你想要什么？
What do you want?

449
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:19,959
什么也不要
Nothing.

450
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:22,157
你没事吗？
Are you all right?

451
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,094
没事
Yeah, I'm all right.

452
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,703
没事
I'm all right.

453
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:33,208
那我走了
I'll go, then.

454
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,679
唐尼，唐尼
Don?

455
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:40,682
不　　　唐尼，过来抱住我
- Oh, Don! - No...

456
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:42,144
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

457
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,845
抱住我，我好怕

458
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:45,487
I'm scared. I'm scared.

459
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,014
我好害怕

460
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,067
I'm scared!

461
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:51,253
没事了
It's OK. It's OK.

462
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,194
Don? Don?

463
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,566
你回来了
Are you back?

464
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:09,574
喜欢我吗？
Do you like me?

465
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,441
你喜欢我吗？　　是的
- Do you like me? - Yes.

466
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:27,956
喜欢我这样摸你吗？
Do you like the way I feel?

467
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,658
喜欢
Yes.

468
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:38,673
要看我的乳房吗？
See my breast?

469
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,712
你可以摸摸
You can feel it.

470
00:49:47,383 --> 00:49:50,944
我的乳头越来越硬了
My nipple is getting hard.

471
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:54,312
你可以去碰碰
You can touch it.

472
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:01,921
你可以去摸那里
You can feel it.

473
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,625
喜欢这种感觉吗？
Do you like the way I feel?

474
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,265
喜欢
Yes.

475
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,765
来吧
Feel me.

476
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,149
打我　　　不行
Hit me.

477
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:23,618
桃乐茜，不，别这样
- Dorothy, no. Stop it. - Hit me.

478
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,984
来打我！
Hit me.

479
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,182
打我

480
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:28,850
打我啊！
Hit me!

481
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,857
我要走了
I'm leaving now.

482
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,334
唐尼
Torned.

483
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,299
唐尼
Torned.

484
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,236
救救我
Help me.

485
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,898
天，是那顶帽子
Oh, my God. That hat.

486
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:54,007
她结过婚了
She's married.

487
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,488
"Don."

488
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,078
救救我
Help me.

489
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:38,786
杰弗里

490
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,691
现在天黑了
Now it's dark.

491
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:51,927
打我
Hit me. Hit me.

492
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,959
打我

493
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,882
Man, oh man.

494
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,747
桑蒂，你说话方便吗？
- Sandy, can ya talk? - Mike's here.

495
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,756
麦克在我这儿
Oh. I guess I'll talk to you later, then.

496
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,883
那我晚点再给你电话

497
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:17,415
事情进行的如何？
- Well, how'd it go? - It went OK. I'll tell you about it.

498
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,327
很顺利，待会再和你说

499
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,694
8点我来接你
I'll pick you up at eight.

500
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:26,293
新斧头…48721
New axe, 48721.

501
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:31,363
22.95美元
Twenty-two...

502
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,619
ninety-five.

503
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:35,842
那到时见　　　好极了
- I'll see ya then. - OK, great.

504
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:37,812
再见　　　再见
- Bye-bye. - Bye.

505
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:17,209
怎么了？
Well?

506
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,245
你不是要告诉我吗？
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

507
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:24,086
好吧
OK.

508
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:30,992
这世界真是无奇不有，桑蒂
It's a strange world, Sandy.

509
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:41,004
桃乐茜华伦早就嫁给了叫唐尼的人
Dorothy Vallens is married, to a man named Don.

510
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:44,444
他们还有个小孩
They have a son.

511
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:45,878
我想她丈夫和小孩
I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

512
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,351
该是被个叫弗兰克的所绑架

513
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:50,875
弗兰克籍此来威胁桃乐茜
Frank has done this to force Dorothy to do things for him.

514
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,684
以强迫她为他做事

515
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,817
我认为她想要寻死
I think she wants to die.

516
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:02,790
所以弗兰克砍掉他丈夫的耳朵
I think Frank cut the ear I found off her husband

517
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,663
做警告以让她活下去
as a warning for her to stay alive.

518
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:09,495
弗兰克是个…
Frank is...

519
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,672
是个极度危险的人物
a very dangerous man.

520
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,612
我的天
My God.

521
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,240
你要把这告诉我父亲吗？
- Shouldn't you tell my father? - No. I can't do that.

522
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,616
我不打算这么做

523
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,587
我还没任何证据
I can't prove any of this. I found out my information illegally.

524
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:28,351
这么做并不合法

525
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,949
而且会被牵涉进很多麻烦事
You could get into a lot of trouble.

526
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,353
昨晚上你看见许多事
You saw all that in one night?

527
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,060
这世界真是无奇不有
It is a strange world.

528
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,876
为何会有弗兰克那样的人？
Why are there people like Frank?

529
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:52,437
为何这世界上有那么多的麻烦？
Why is there so much trouble in this world?

530
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,884
我就是不明白
I don't know.

531
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,387
我做了个梦
I had a dream.

532
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,964
就在遇到你的那晚做的
In fact, it was the night I met you.

533
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:20,798
在那梦中，是我们的世界
In the dream, there was our world,

534
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:23,902
而那世界是黑暗的
and the world was dark because there weren't any robins.

535
00:56:23,946 --> 00:56:25,709
因为那儿没有知更鸟

536
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:28,512
知更鸟就象征着爱
And the robins represented love.

537
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,747
很久很久…
And for the longest time there was just this darkness.

538
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:36,280
那儿一直漆黑一片

539
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:39,385
然后忽然间
And all of a sudden

540
00:56:39,428 --> 00:56:42,420
成千上万的知更鸟被放出
thousands of robins were set free.

541
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,126
它们飞向大地
And they flew down and brought this blinding light of love.

542
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,431
带来了眩目的爱之光芒

543
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:53,500
在那儿爱就是…
And it seemed like that love

544
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,603
唯一能改变一切的力量
would be the only thing that would make any difference,

545
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,671
唯一能改变一切的力量
and it did.

546
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,421
所以我想那代表着
So I guess it means...

547
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:15,362
我们总会迎来光明的一天
there is trouble till the robins come.

548
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,031
你是个好女孩
You're a neat girl.

549
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,261
你也是
So are you.

550
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,671
我是说，你是个好男孩
I mean... you're a neat guy.

551
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:38,247
我们还是快走吧
I guess we better go.

552
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,385
我也这么想
Yeah. I guess so.

553
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:11,612
我能进来吗？
Hi. May I come in?

554
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,848
当然
Yes.

555
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,753
快进来吧
Hurry, though.

556
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,595
你还好吧？
Are you all right?

557
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:29,564
不好
No, I'm not.

558
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,075
你来这儿干什么？
Why are you here?

559
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,872
你想要什么？
What do you want?

560
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,400
我…

561
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:41,016
今晚我在衣柜里找了你整夜
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

562
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,981
我明白这很疯狂
It's crazy, I know. I don't know where you come from, but...

563
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,854
我不知道你从哪儿来

564
00:58:48,891 --> 00:58:50,518
可我喜欢你
I like you.

565
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:53,524
这并不疯狂
It's not crazy. I like you too.

566
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:55,587
我也喜欢你

567
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,999
我想像昨晚那样
I liked being with you last night.

568
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,562
相同的地点
Same here.

569
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,642
请陪着我
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

570
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,648
跟我在一起

571
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,251
就如同
Like a flame burning brightly

572
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:22,155
火焰发出光芒

573
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:27,861
但是当她离去
But when she left

574
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:32,163
蓝丝绒的光芒也消失
Gone was the glow

575
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,066
蓝丝绒的光芒也消失
Of

576
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:38,164
蓝丝绒的光芒也消失
Blue velvet

577
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,108
蓝丝绒的光芒也消失

578
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:45,238
只有在我心中
But in my heart there'll always be

579
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,306
她们常在

580
00:59:49,985 --> 00:59:52,886
珍惜地保有这份回忆
Precious and warm a memory

581
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,823
珍惜地保有这份回忆

582
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:00,420
年复一年…
Through the years

583
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,594
我仍然能看到
And I still can see

584
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,035
我仍然能看到

585
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:14,508
蓝丝绒
Blue velvet

586
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:16,340
透过我的眼泪
Through my tears

587
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:19,313
透过我的眼泪

588
01:00:19,348 --> 01:00:23,444
透过我的眼泪

589
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,749
USA

590
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:16,826
砍伐，砍伐，砍伐，伐木镇，美国
Logs, logs, logs. Lumberton, USA.

591
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:19,265
大树倒下的声音响起时
At the sound of the falling tree...

592
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:24,234
现在已是1点30分，这里是伐木镇地方电台
it's 1.30.

593
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:23,803
This is the mighty voice of Lumberton,

594
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:28,635
那里的人知道…有多少木材被砍伐
the town where people really know how much wood a woodchuck chucks.

595
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:31,064
...seven, eight, nine,

596
01:02:31,152 --> 01:02:33,608
10, 1 1, 1 2,

597
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:36,188
1 3, 1 4, 1 5,

598
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:39,318
16, 1 7, 18, 1 9, 20...

599
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:41,407
快走
Keep going.

600
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:43,244
桑蒂
Sandy.

601
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:51,289
太棒了
Oh, great.

602
01:02:51,324 --> 01:02:52,791
你迟到了
- You're late. - I'm sorry.

603
01:02:52,825 --> 01:02:54,622
我很抱歉
- What am I gonna do now? - You wanna go talk to him?

604
01:02:54,694 --> 01:02:56,525
我现在该怎么办？

605
01:02:56,596 --> 01:02:58,223
需要和他谈谈吗？
Yeah, but... I don't think it's gonna do much good.

606
01:02:58,297 --> 01:03:02,461
随便，不过我不觉得会有效

607
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:05,198
走吧，稍后我会和他解释
Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.

608
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,571
注意墙上的钟了吗？
See that clock on the wall?

609
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,647
Yeah.

610
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:22,081
接下来的五分钟里
Five minutes from now, you're not gonna believe what I've told you.

611
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:24,555
你绝对不敢相信我告诉你的话

612
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:31,461
首先…
Number one.

613
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:35,798
今天我带照相机去了弗兰克的公寓
Today I staked out Frank's place With a camera.

614
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:38,497
结果还发现有个人与此有关部门
There's another man involved in all this. I call him the Yellow Man.

615
01:03:38,538 --> 01:03:41,769
我管他叫“黄人”

616
01:03:41,808 --> 01:03:44,743
就是那天你在桃乐茜家门口见到的那个
You saw his back the other day at Dorothy's apartment.

617
01:03:44,778 --> 01:03:48,509
我看见黄人和弗兰克进了住处
Today I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank.

618
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:50,846
两人有说有笑的

619
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:53,853
问题是那意味着什么？
Now, the only trouble is, what does that prove?

620
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:58,722
好像是没什么意义，不过却很有趣
Nothing, really. But it's interesting.

621
01:04:00,527 --> 01:04:05,123
第二…后来我看到黄人走出来
Number two.

622
01:04:02,777 --> 01:04:04,651
I saw the Yellow Man come out

623
01:04:05,198 --> 01:04:10,398
跟一个提着公事包的衣冠楚楚的家伙碰头
and meet a well-dressed man carrying an alligator briefcase.

624
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:25,616
然后他们去了城里
They went to a factory, stood on a staircase and looked into the distance.

625
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:28,883
走上楼梯，进了那屋

626
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:33,926
注意听着
Now get this. In the distance, there was a murder.

627
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,793
接着那里就发生了凶杀案

628
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,457
有个毒贩被射杀
A drug dealer was shot to death and a woman had her legs broken.

629
01:04:39,532 --> 01:04:41,056
还有个女人也断了腿
Jeffrey...

630
01:04:41,134 --> 01:04:42,465
杰弗里…

631
01:04:45,605 --> 01:04:49,006
有两个人告诉我
Then two guys told me the police would find drugs in the dead dealer's place.

632
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:52,810
警方在死掉的毒贩住处找到大量毒品

633
01:04:52,811 --> 01:04:56,339
真不敢相信，你找到了这些
I can't believe what you're finding out.

634
01:04:56,382 --> 01:04:58,782
你还打算继续下去吗？
Are you gonna continue with this?

635
01:05:00,086 --> 01:05:02,884
对
Yeah.

636
01:05:02,922 --> 01:05:04,321
那要到何时才停手？
Until when? What are you gonna do with this?

637
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:09,884
关于这些情报你打算怎么处理？　　不知道
Well, I don't know.

638
01:05:10,063 --> 01:05:13,032
你还要去她公寓？
You're not going back to her apartment?

639
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:14,499
对
Yeah.

640
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,697
杰弗里，为什么？
Jeffrey, why?

641
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:26,501
我发现了些被掩盖很久的事
I'm seeing something that was always hidden.

642
01:05:26,546 --> 01:05:28,514
那是宗很神秘的案件
I'm involved in a mystery. I'm in the middle of a mystery.

643
01:05:28,548 --> 01:05:31,073
我已经神不知鬼不觉的

644
01:05:31,117 --> 01:05:34,018
涉身于其中了
And it's all secret.

645
01:05:34,053 --> 01:05:36,521
你那么喜欢那种神秘感？
You like mysteries that much?

646
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:38,387
对
Yeah.

647
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,130
你就很神秘
You're a mystery.

648
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:48,133
我喜欢你
I like you...

649
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:50,135
很喜欢
very much.

650
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:00,635
是吗？
Yeah?

651
01:06:09,422 --> 01:06:13,085
杰弗里…别这样
Jeffrey, don't. Please.

652
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:23,802
你真的担心我吗？
You worry about me? Really?

653
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,565
是的
Yeah.

654
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:28,267
很惊讶吗？
Is that so surprising?

655
01:06:28,308 --> 01:06:31,072
我非常担心你
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

656
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:35,603
是我把你扯进来的
I got you into this.

657
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:42,368
Blue velvet

658
01:06:42,462 --> 01:06:44,122
Whoa- Whoa

659
01:06:47,343 --> 01:06:53,925
She wore blue velvet

660
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,129
Whoa- Whoa

661
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:59,014
Bluer than velvet was the night

662
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:00,929
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

663
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,065
Softer than satin was the light

664
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:09,268
From the stars

665
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:16,609
She wore blue velvet

666
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:18,233
Whoa- Whoa

667
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:22,076
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

668
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,873
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

669
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:28,288
Warmer than May her tender sighs

670
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:31,589
Love was ours

671
01:07:45,118 --> 01:07:47,109
去卧室
Come to my bedroom.

672
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:06,036
你想要做什么？
What do you want to do?

673
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:08,666
我正在做呢
I'm doing it.

674
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,336
你是个坏小子吗？
Are you a bad boy?

675
01:08:11,377 --> 01:08:13,470
什么意思？
What do you mean?

676
01:08:13,513 --> 01:08:16,539
想要做坏事吗？
Do you wanna do bad things?

677
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:19,016
什么都可以
Anything.

678
01:08:19,052 --> 01:08:21,043
什么都可以
Anything.

679
01:08:23,122 --> 01:08:25,454
你想要怎么样的？
What do you want?

680
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:27,755
我想你打我
I want you to hurt me.

681
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:30,489
不！我不想伤害你
No. I don't wanna hurt you. I told you, I wanna help you.

682
01:08:30,563 --> 01:08:32,554
我说过我只想帮你
Dorothy, I know some of what's happening.

683
01:08:32,632 --> 01:08:35,601
桃乐茜，我知道是怎么回事

684
01:08:35,635 --> 01:08:39,071
弗兰克是不是抓了你丈夫和孩子？
Frank has your husband and son, doesn't he?

685
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:42,107
你得要想办法报警
Dorothy, you gotta do something, go to the police or...

686
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:46,544
不要报警！
No police!

687
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:48,069
不要报警！
No police!

688
01:08:48,114 --> 01:08:50,639
唐尼，来打我
Don!

689
01:08:49,077 --> 01:08:51,448
- Hit me! - No! No!

690
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:52,150
不！不！
Get away! Get away from my bed! Stay away!

691
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:54,585
滚开！从我床上滚下去！

692
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,110
滚开！

693
01:09:23,549 --> 01:09:26,245
你在我身上留下记号了
I have your disease in me now.

694
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:53,105
他总是让我很开心
It used to make me laugh.

695
01:09:54,614 --> 01:09:56,605
对不起，桃乐茜
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

696
01:09:58,618 --> 01:10:00,483
我得走了
- I should go. - Yes.

697
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,987
是的

698
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:11,086
你认为我不正常是吗？
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

699
01:10:11,164 --> 01:10:13,428
我想要你留下
I want you to stay.

700
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:15,195
别恨我
- Don't hate me. - I sure don't hate you.

701
01:10:15,234 --> 01:10:17,532
我当然不会恨你

702
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,266
我没疯
I'm not crazy.

703
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:23,537
我还能分辨对错
I know the difference between right and wrong.

704
01:10:23,576 --> 01:10:25,567
那很好
That's good.

705
01:10:27,847 --> 01:10:29,906
你是我特别的朋友
You're my special friend.

706
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,550
我把你放在我心里
I still have you inside of me.

707
01:10:36,589 --> 01:10:39,820
那让我振作
It helps me.

708
01:10:39,859 --> 01:10:41,759
我需要你
I need you.

709
01:10:43,296 --> 01:10:45,059
我会给你电话
I'll call you.

710
01:10:45,131 --> 01:10:46,928
好的
OK.

711
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,431
很快就给我打？
Soon?

712
01:10:52,104 --> 01:10:54,504
你不骗我？
- Are you lying to me? - No.

713
01:10:55,975 --> 01:10:57,169
真的？
- Are you sure? - Hey!

714
01:11:00,213 --> 01:11:01,908
你好，宝贝
Hello, baby.

715
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:05,575
这杂种是谁？
- Who is this fuck? - A friend. He's from the neighbourhood.

716
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:07,415
是个朋友

717
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:10,081
就住在附近

718
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:12,113
只是过来陪我说说话
We were just talking.

719
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:17,425
你就住在附近
You're from the neighbourhood.

720
01:11:17,496 --> 01:11:19,157
对
Yeah.

721
01:11:19,232 --> 01:11:20,995
那你就是邻居了
You're a neighbour.

722
01:11:23,002 --> 01:11:25,266
你叫什么？好邻居
- Well, what's your name, neighbour? - Jeffrey.

723
01:11:25,304 --> 01:11:26,896
杰弗里
He's a good kid, Frank.

724
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:28,998
他是个好孩子，弗兰克

725
01:11:30,142 --> 01:11:32,474
给老子闭嘴！
Shut the fuck up!

726
01:11:35,982 --> 01:11:38,450
要我带你兜风吗？
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

727
01:11:38,484 --> 01:11:40,452
不用，谢了
No, thanks.

728
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:42,954
不用，谢了？这算是什么意思？
"No, thanks"? What does that mean?

729
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:44,957
我不想去
- I don't wanna go. - Go where?

730
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:46,982
去哪儿？兜风
- For a ride. - A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

731
01:11:47,026 --> 01:11:50,359
兜风！这注意不错

732
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:52,488
我们走
OK. Let's go.

733
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:58,030
带上你的外套
Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

734
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,537
雷蒙德！
Raymond?

735
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:02,541
我们去兜兜风
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

736
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:04,065
兜风
Joyride.

737
01:12:17,657 --> 01:12:19,056
你想要去哪儿？
All right, where do you wanna go?

738
01:12:20,826 --> 01:12:22,054
我明白了
Oh, I know. We got to go to Ben's, right?

739
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:24,096
我们去看看本如何？
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

740
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,031
是的，我们得去看看本

741
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:29,466
对，我们就去那里
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

742
01:12:29,502 --> 01:12:31,902
我们也许全会被杀
We may all be killed.

743
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:37,671
他真是个娘娘腔，弗兰克
- He's a pussy, Frank. - Yeah, but he's our pussy.

744
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,440
不过他是我们的娘娘腔
- Right, tits? - Pussy heaven.

745
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:42,140
娘娘腔的天堂

746
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:44,615
你去过娘娘腔天堂没有？
You ever been to pussy heaven?

747
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,015
没有
No.

748
01:12:46,052 --> 01:12:47,246
他说什么？
- What'd he say? - No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

749
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:50,517
不，没去过娘娘腔天堂

750
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:56,586
警方来点
- Po-lice call. Po-lice call. - Bury that fuck!

751
01:12:59,031 --> 01:13:02,694
好极了

我想你来见见我朋友

759
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:30,861
雷蒙德，去买些啤酒来，记得买上本那份
Hey, Raymond? You get enough beer for Ben, too.

760
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:32,329
你喜欢什么牌子的啤酒？
- What beer do you like? - Heineken.

761
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:34,230

Oh, Frank. This is a fine surprise that you brought your friends.

你带了那么多朋友
I love surprises.

767
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:02,851
我喜欢惊喜

768
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:04,795
请坐下
Please, sit down.

769
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:07,961
装腔作势…
Suave... Goddamn, you're one suave fucker.

770
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,333
你真他妈够蠢的！

771
01:14:12,738 --> 01:14:14,137
要来点啤酒吗？
- You want some beer? - Of course, Frank.

772
01:14:14,173 --> 01:14:17,040
当然，弗兰克

那话可吓不了我
That doesn't scare me.

786
01:15:00,786 --> 01:15:03,220
我叫保罗，你叫什么？

01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:17,366
杯子都在哪儿？
Where's the glasses? That beer's gonna get warm.

789
01:15:17,403 --> 01:15:19,769
啤酒都快热了

790
01:15:19,805 --> 01:15:22,569
我最他妈受不了…就是喝热啤酒！
One thing I can't fuckin' stand is warm beer! It makes me fuckin' puke!

791
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:24,769
那味道让我要呕吐！

792
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:27,210
亲爱的，杯子怎么还不拿来？
Darling, where's the glasses?

796
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:37,312
就在这儿，弗兰克
It's right here, Frank.

797
01:15:39,592 --> 01:15:41,082
要我倒吗？
- D'you want me to pour it? - No, I want you to fuck it!

798
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:42,754
不是，我要你拿这干自己！

让我们为操得愉快而干杯
Let's drink to fucking.

805
01:16:05,317 --> 01:16:08,753
还是说“祝你操得愉快，弗兰克”
Yeah, say "Here's to your fuck, Frank."

806

824
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:11,739
这样感觉好些了吧？

Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight, cos he's the man, right?

831
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:57,928
反正他是老大
He took those drugs away and it was fuckin' beautiful.

832
01:17:57,996 --> 01:18:02,092
然后就把那些毒品全吞了，真他妈漂亮！

那糖色小精灵
A candy-coloured clown they call the Sandman

842
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:57,521

01:18:57,556 --> 01:19:01,287
每晚悄悄进入我房间
Tiptoes to my room every night

844
01:19:01,326 --> 01:19:05,092
撒下星尘飒飒私语
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

845
01:19:05,163 --> 01:19:06,562
伴我入眠
"Go to sleep"

846
01:19:06,598 --> 01:19:11,058
万物如此安祥
"Everything is all right"

847
01:19:11,136 --> 01:19:16,267
我闭上双眼
I close my eyes

848
01:19:16,308 --> 01:19:20,972
将自己漂进一个魔法的夜晚
Then I drift away

849
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:24,846
将自己漂进一个魔法的夜晚
Into the magic night

850
01:19:24,883 --> 01:19:29,513
我柔柔的道出
I softly say

851

一个无声的祈祷
A silent prayer

852
01:19:33,892 --> 01:19:38,591
就似那梦想家
Like dreamers do

853
01:19:38,663 --> 01:19:42,793
然后安枕入眠
Then I fall asleep to dream

854

去那有你的梦乡

在梦中，我向你倾诉衷肠
In dreams I talk

858
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,649
在梦中，我向你倾诉衷肠
To you

859
01:20:07,292 --> 01:20:12,320

864
01:20:25,343 --> 01:20:27,470
带我们的好邻居去兜兜风！
We're givin' our neighbour a joyride! Let's get on with it!

865
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:28,706

再见了，本
Anyone wanna go on a joyride with us?

867
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:34,144
有谁要和我们一起去兜风吗？

868
01:20:34,186 --> 01:20:35,983
你想要去吗？
How about you? Huh?

869
01:20:39,191 --> 01:20:41,955
你摆张臭脸给谁看？
No smile for Frank? No?

870
01:20:42,027 --> 01:20:44,587
不愿意笑？

871
01:20:44,663 --> 01:20:46,995
去死吧！我们走！
OK, fuck it! Let's go!

872
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:52,461
想跟雷蒙德一起走吗？来吧
You wanna go with Raymond? Come on.

873
01:20:54,472 --> 01:20:56,940
星期二见，弗兰克
I'll see ya Tuesday, Frank.

874
01:20:56,975 --> 01:20:58,966
好的，本
Right, Ben.

875
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,971
现在天黑了
Now it's dark.

876
01:21:06,918 --> 01:21:09,386
我们来搞吧！
Let's fuck!

877
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:13,790
我要搞死一切会动的东西！
I'll fuck anything that moves!

878
01:21:31,209 --> 01:21:32,699
我们要去哪儿，弗兰克？
Where are we going, Frank?

879
01:21:32,744 --> 01:21:36,236
带你的好邻居去乡下！
I'm takin' your neighbour out to the fuckin' country.

880
01:21:38,884 --> 01:21:40,852
你喜欢走路吗？
Hey, do you like to walk?

881
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:42,945
在和你说话呢，混蛋！
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, shithead. - What?

882
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:44,046
什么？
He said "What?", Frank.

883
01:21:44,089 --> 01:21:46,421
他说“什么”，弗兰克

884
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:49,256
什么？
What.

885
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:57,464
这家伙和你有什么关系？
Hey! What has this fuck got to do with anything?

886
01:21:58,436 --> 01:21:59,767
他妈的！
Jesus, goddamn.

887
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,739
你这该死的家伙！
You fuck!

888
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:12,409
你在看什么？
What're you looking at?

889
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:14,418
什么也没看
Nothing.

890
01:22:15,587 --> 01:22:18,488
不许看着我，杂种！
Don't you look at me, fuck!

891
01:22:18,523 --> 01:22:22,856
要让我再见到你看着我，老子杀了你
I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.

892
01:22:44,616 --> 01:22:47,107
你很像我
You're like me.

893
01:22:53,124 --> 01:22:55,490
看看那里
Oh, look at those.

894
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:57,586
这些是什么？
What are these?

895
01:22:57,662 --> 01:22:59,129
弗兰克，求求你，我们走吧
- Please, Frank, let's go. - Don't say please, fuckhead!

896
01:22:59,164 --> 01:23:01,564
不许求我！

897
01:23:04,636 --> 01:23:08,231
宝宝想要捏捏它们
Ooh, baby... Ooh, baby wants to pinch them.

898
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:11,375
怎么了？
What's the matter? Give 'em back. They're just a little red, that's all.

899
01:23:11,409 --> 01:23:13,434
不，把它们还我

900
01:23:13,478 --> 01:23:14,877
怎么了？

901
01:23:14,913 --> 01:23:16,380
它们只是有点红
Ooh, let me feel 'em. Come here.

902
01:23:16,414 --> 01:23:19,781
让我摸摸！来嘛！

903
01:23:19,818 --> 01:23:21,615
放开她！
Leave her alone!

904
01:23:29,294 --> 01:23:31,057
混蛋！
Goddamn!

905
01:23:31,129 --> 01:23:34,929
你给我滚下车来！
Next!

906
01:23:32,023 --> 01:23:36,815
You, out of the car, fuck! Get him out of the car, Raymond!

907
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:37,434
把他给我带下车，雷蒙德！

908
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:41,072
弗兰克！弗兰克，他不是故意的！
- Frank! Frank! He didn't mean anything! - Shut up! Shut up.

909
01:23:41,106 --> 01:23:42,596
闭嘴！闭嘴！

910
01:23:57,622 --> 01:23:59,590
真漂亮，真漂亮
Pretty, pretty. Pretty, pretty.

911
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:02,184
真漂亮，真漂亮

912
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,163
弗兰克，放开他！
Frank, leave him alone!

913
01:24:06,596 --> 01:24:08,505
Frank! Frank!

914
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:14,931
保罗…
Paul... candy-coloured clown.

915
01:24:14,973 --> 01:24:16,565
“糖色小精灵”

916
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,542
你运气好，还能活着
You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.

917
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:24,895
A candy-coloured clown they call the Sandman

918
01:24:24,987 --> 01:24:27,858
-  Tiptoes to my room every night - Look at me.

919
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:28,074
看着我

920
01:24:29,242 --> 01:24:32,693
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

921
01:24:32,786 --> 01:24:38,575
-  "Go to sleep, everything is all right" - Candy-coloured clown.

922
01:24:35,193 --> 01:24:38,560
糖色小精灵

923
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:42,038
I close my eyes

924
01:24:43,755 --> 01:24:47,040
Then I drift away

925
01:24:47,772 --> 01:24:50,605
别和她走的太近
Don't be a good neighbour to her.

926
01:24:52,444 --> 01:24:55,641
我从我心坎里…
I'll send you a love letter.

927
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,774
向你寄出情书，杂种！
Straight from my heart, fucker!

928
01:24:58,817 --> 01:25:01,547
你明白什么是情书吗？
Do you know what a love letter is?

929
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:05,818
就是从他妈枪里出来的子弹！
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker.

930
01:25:05,857 --> 01:25:08,052
等你收到我的情书
You receive a love letter from me, you are fucked for ever!

931
01:25:08,093 --> 01:25:10,186
你他妈就此完蛋了！

932
01:25:11,729 --> 01:25:13,594
明白吗，杂种？
You understand, fuck?

933
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:19,030
我会送你下地狱，杂种！
- I'll send you straight to hell, fucker! -  In dreams

934
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:21,279
I walk

935
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:24,455
-  With you - In dreams...

936
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:25,802
在梦中…

937
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:28,005
我与你同行
- I walk with you. -  In dreams

938
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:33,626
-  I talk to you - In dreams... I talk... to you.

939
01:25:29,914 --> 01:25:34,510
在梦中，我向你倾诉

940
01:25:34,926 --> 01:25:40,002
-  In dreams you're mine - In dreams... you're mine.

941
01:25:37,222 --> 01:25:40,783
在梦中，你属于我

942
01:25:40,097 --> 01:25:42,884
-  All the time - All...

943
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:47,351
We're together

944
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:52,478
-  In dreams, in dreams - For ever in dreams.

945
01:25:49,601 --> 01:25:53,196
永远在梦中

946
01:25:55,027 --> 01:25:57,102
But just

947
01:25:57,405 --> 01:26:00,571
Before the dawn

948
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:08,536
-  I awake and find - Feel this.

949
01:26:06,551 --> 01:26:08,348
感觉真好

950
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:10,497
You gone

951
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,876
I can't help it

952
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:17,454
I can't help it

953
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:20,501
If I cry

954
01:26:20,565 --> 01:26:23,033
看看我的肌肉
Feel my muscles. Huh?

955
01:26:23,067 --> 01:26:25,592
来看看！
Feel 'em! Huh? You like that?

956
01:26:26,704 --> 01:26:27,898
你喜欢吗？

957
01:26:29,407 --> 01:26:32,001
把他给我抓紧了
Hold him tight for me.

958
01:26:34,846 --> 01:26:36,245
弗兰克，住手！
Frank, stop it!

959
01:26:38,683 --> 01:26:42,016
弗兰克，住手！弗兰克！不要！
Frank, stop it! Frank! Stop!

960
01:26:46,024 --> 01:26:49,357
住手！住手！
Frank, stop it! Stop it!

961
01:26:51,396 --> 01:26:53,023
住手，弗兰克！
Stop it, Frank!

962
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:03,288
In dreams you're mine

963
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:36,632
（ 牧场路 ）

964
01:27:52,557 --> 01:27:54,752
打我！
Hit me.

965
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:21,111
不，唐尼！妈妈爱你！
No, Donny, Mama loves you!

966
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,707
杰弗里，你说的是什么意思？
What do you mean, you're lucky to be able to call me?

967
01:28:43,741 --> 01:28:46,209
什么叫能打电话给我…算是幸运？
Things got out of hand.

968
01:28:46,244 --> 01:28:49,145
事情有些出乎意料

969
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:52,707
我找到些情报，可能会帮上你父亲
I know some things. They could help your father, but you might get into trouble.

970
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,615
不过也会给你带来麻烦

971
01:28:54,652 --> 01:28:58,110
别管我，你还是和他说吧
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

972
01:28:57,734 --> 01:29:01,684
OK. I promise I won't mention you.

973
01:29:00,491 --> 01:29:02,425
我保证不会提到你的

974
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,553
杰弗里，我不开玩笑
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

975
01:29:04,629 --> 01:29:06,722
不用管我

976
01:29:06,798 --> 01:29:10,825
若没变故那就周五见
- Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before. - OK.

977
01:29:10,902 --> 01:29:12,335
好，再见，桑蒂
- Bye-bye, Sandy. - Bye.

978
01:29:29,487 --> 01:29:31,648
别问我，我不想说
I don't wanna talk about it.

979
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:34,351
什么都过去了
Everything is OK now. I just don't wanna talk about it.

980
01:29:34,392 --> 01:29:36,360
我不想再提起了
Sometimes it's good to talk things over. For instance, they say many marriages...

981
01:29:36,427 --> 01:29:39,624
有时候还是把事情说出来好，杰弗里

982
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:41,688
比如说，有很多婚姻
Aunt Barbara... I love you but you're gonna get it.

983
01:29:41,766 --> 01:29:43,461
芭芭拉姨妈

984
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:45,662
我爱你，不过你不会明白的

985
01:30:16,868 --> 01:30:18,335
高登
Gordon.

986
01:30:18,403 --> 01:30:21,930
高登要在大白天去找他
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight, cos he's the man, right?

987
01:30:21,973 --> 01:30:23,406
反正他是老大
He took those drugs away and it was beautiful.

988
01:30:23,441 --> 01:30:27,639
他把那些毒品全吞了！真是漂亮！

989
01:31:00,011 --> 01:31:01,672
我来！
I got it.

990
01:31:04,682 --> 01:31:07,879
杰弗里，进来吧
- Jeffrey. Come on in. - Jeffrey.

991
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,418
你好，桑蒂
- Hi, Sandy. - Hi, Jeffrey.

992
01:31:11,456 --> 01:31:12,821
你好，杰弗里
- Sorry to bother you, but I need to talk. - OK. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

993
01:31:12,857 --> 01:31:15,087
很抱歉打搅你，但有些事情必须要说

994
01:31:15,126 --> 01:31:18,584
你的脸怎么破相了

995
01:31:18,663 --> 01:31:19,630
对
- Yeah. - Come on into my study.

996
01:31:19,664 --> 01:31:22,132
去我的书房说

997
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:28,435
我来给你看些照片
I have to show you some photos and tell you some things about them.

998
01:31:28,473 --> 01:31:30,964
还要告诉你关于他们的事

999
01:31:33,144 --> 01:31:35,135
首先是这张照片
This is the first picture.

1000
01:31:37,048 --> 01:31:39,039
是弗兰克布斯
It's Frank Booth.

1001
01:31:40,551 --> 01:31:43,816
他是个极端危险的变态人物
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

1002
01:31:43,855 --> 01:31:47,586
他的住址就在照片背面
His address is on the back of the photo.

1003
01:31:48,826 --> 01:31:51,818
这张是弗兰克和另外一个人
This photo is of Frank and another man as they went into Frank's building.

1004
01:31:51,863 --> 01:31:54,423
他们走进弗兰克的住处时拍的

1005
01:32:11,182 --> 01:32:14,640
接着是那人出来找第三个人
And then that man came out and met with a third man. This well-dressed guy.

1006
01:32:14,685 --> 01:32:16,482
是个衣冠楚楚的家伙
Here's that photo.

1007
01:32:16,521 --> 01:32:17,954
这里是那张照片

1008
01:32:22,226 --> 01:32:24,694
我好知道有个叫桃乐茜华伦的女人…
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people.

1009
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:26,253
也被卷入了这桩案子

1010
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:29,493
我想是弗兰克绑架了她的丈夫和儿子
I think Frank kidnapped her husband and son. I have no hard proof of this.

1011
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:31,797
不过我没有什么有力证据

1012
01:32:34,572 --> 01:32:36,233
桑蒂有参与吗？
- Is Sandy part of this? - Oh, no. No.

1013
01:32:36,274 --> 01:32:38,037
没有

1014
01:32:40,845 --> 01:32:43,336
还有谁知道你有这些照片？
Who else knows you have these photos?

1015
01:32:43,381 --> 01:32:46,714
只有你和冲印照片的人
Just you and the photo lab.

1016
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:48,878
你已经插手管这案子？
- And you're through with this now? - Yes, sir, I am.

1017
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,854
是的，先生

1018
01:32:53,925 --> 01:32:56,655
可现在你最好快退出
For now, all right, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this.

1019
01:32:56,694 --> 01:32:58,025
最好桑蒂也与此无关

1020
01:32:58,095 --> 01:32:59,494
我只能这么说

1021
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:05,631
准备近期来局里做祥细的口供
Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

1022
01:33:05,636 --> 01:33:07,901
准备近期来局里做祥细的口供

1023
01:33:08,773 --> 01:33:10,263
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

1024
01:33:19,283 --> 01:33:21,080
没事吧？
- Is everything OK? - Yeah. Is Friday still on?

1025
01:33:21,118 --> 01:33:24,087
对，星期五的约会还去吗？

1026
01:33:24,121 --> 01:33:26,589
你没把我也供出去？
- You didn't tell him about me? - No.

1027
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:28,091
没有
Why did I ever get you going on this, Jeffrey?

1028
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:31,583
我真不该把你牵涉进这事，杰弗里

1029
01:33:34,832 --> 01:33:36,800
星期五的约会当然会去
- Of course Friday's still on. - Great. See ya then.

1030
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:39,598
太好了，那到时见

1031
01:33:39,637 --> 01:33:41,628
晚安，威廉斯探长
Good night, Detective Williams.

1032
01:33:46,811 --> 01:33:48,278
晚安，桑蒂
- Night, Sandy. - Good night, Jeffrey.

1033
01:33:48,312 --> 01:33:49,802
晚安，杰弗里

1034
01:33:59,156 --> 01:34:00,783
爸…
Dad?

1035
01:34:00,825 --> 01:34:03,225
出什么事了？
What's wrong?

1036
01:34:03,294 --> 01:34:06,092
最好是没出什么事
There better be nothin' wrong.

1037
01:35:03,554 --> 01:35:05,385
让我看看

1038
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:08,981
我去开　　　谢谢
- I'll get it. - OK, thanks.

1039
01:35:12,563 --> 01:35:14,531
晚上好，杰弗里，进来吧
- Jeffrey, come on in. - Thanks, Mrs Williams.

1040
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:17,532
谢谢，威廉斯太太　　　她正在等你
- She's all ready. - OK.

1041
01:35:19,003 --> 01:35:20,470
你真漂亮
- You look great. - Thanks.

1042
01:35:20,504 --> 01:35:21,971
谢谢

1043
01:35:22,006 --> 01:35:24,065
你好，威廉斯探长
- Hello, Detective Williams. - Hello, Jeffrey.

1044
01:35:24,108 --> 01:35:25,598
你好，杰弗里
- You all set? - Almost.

1045
01:35:25,643 --> 01:35:27,668
好了吗？就快了

1046
01:35:27,712 --> 01:35:29,680
约翰，我们得快点了
Hey, John, get a move on.

1047
01:35:36,387 --> 01:35:37,786
稍等会，汤姆
Just a minute, Tom.

1048
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:41,681
放轻松点，杰弗里
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

1049
01:35:43,561 --> 01:35:45,324
注意自己的举动
Behave yourself. Don't blow it.

1050
01:35:45,396 --> 01:35:47,261
别把事情搞杂了

1051
01:35:47,298 --> 01:35:50,267
快点，约翰，上车了，伙计
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

1052
01:35:50,334 --> 01:35:52,928
再见，杰弗里
So long, Jeffrey. You two have a nice time tonight, OK?

1053
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:55,803
祝你们今晚玩的开心

1054
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,307
怎么了？
- OK. - What's goin' on?

1055
01:35:57,341 --> 01:35:59,866
只不过是父辈的忠告
Just a little fatherly advice.

1056
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:01,605
没错，杰弗里
That's right, Jeffrey.

1057
01:36:01,645 --> 01:36:03,169
来吧
Come on.

1058
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:07,249
再见，爸爸，晚安，妈妈
Bye, Dad.

1059
01:36:05,703 --> 01:36:09,487
- Good night, Mom. - Bye. Have a good time.

1060
01:36:07,284 --> 01:36:10,048
再见，玩的开心

1061
01:36:10,087 --> 01:36:11,554
晚安，桑蒂　　　晚安，汤姆
- Night, Sandy. - Good night, Tom.

1062
01:36:19,096 --> 01:36:20,859
杰弗里，刚才是怎么了？
- Jeffrey, what was that all about? - It's nothing.

1063
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:24,332
真的没什么

1064
01:36:22,928 --> 01:36:25,003
Really.

1065
01:36:25,803 --> 01:36:27,771
能见到你真好
It's good to see you.

1066
01:36:27,805 --> 01:36:30,137
我也是
It's good to see you.

1067
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:38,646
你今晚真漂亮
You look beautiful.

1068
01:36:41,986 --> 01:36:43,920
谢谢
Thank you.

1069
01:36:50,953 --> 01:36:53,028
Hi.

1070
01:36:58,736 --> 01:37:00,328
稍等会

1071
01:37:17,454 --> 01:37:20,753
都招呼好了
- It's all taken care of. - OK.

1072
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:23,021
要喝点什么吗？
You want a drink?

1073
01:37:24,995 --> 01:37:26,622
想要跳舞吗？
Wanna dance?

1074
01:37:28,111 --> 01:37:30,186
Yeah.

1075
01:37:39,037 --> 01:37:46,167
Sometimes a wind blows

1076
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:55,005
And you and I

1077
01:37:55,595 --> 01:38:02,177
Float

1078
01:38:02,768 --> 01:38:11,106
In love

1079
01:38:11,775 --> 01:38:18,821
And kiss for ever

1080
01:38:19,323 --> 01:38:26,655
In a darkness

1081
01:38:27,998 --> 01:38:34,036
And the mysteries of love

1082
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:36,800
我爱你，杰弗里
I love you, Jeffrey.

1083
01:38:36,382 --> 01:38:40,081
Come clear

1084
01:38:40,471 --> 01:38:42,462
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1085
01:38:45,139 --> 01:38:51,223
In you

1086
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:56,812
In me

1087
01:38:57,316 --> 01:39:01,265
And show

1088
01:39:01,361 --> 01:39:04,529
That we

1089
01:39:05,407 --> 01:39:13,450
Are love

1090
01:39:21,946 --> 01:39:23,937
再见
Bye. See you later.

1091
01:40:09,193 --> 01:40:10,319
那是什么了？
- What's goin' on? - What is it?

1092
01:40:10,394 --> 01:40:11,725
什么？

1093
01:40:12,997 --> 01:40:15,261
他想要撞我们
They're gonna hit us.

1094
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,295
天！这是怎么了？
- Oh, my God, what's wrong? - It's Frank.

1095
01:40:18,335 --> 01:40:19,962
那是弗兰克

1096
01:40:26,243 --> 01:40:27,972
快滚开！
Move it!

1097
01:40:28,012 --> 01:40:29,604
坐稳了！
Hang on.

1098
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,718
我甩不掉这家伙
I can't outrun this guy. My father's got a gun at home.

1099
01:40:34,752 --> 01:40:36,413
父亲在家里留了把枪
- Jeffrey, no. - Sandy, this guy's a killer. I promise you.

1100
01:40:36,453 --> 01:40:38,011
杰弗里，别这样！

1101
01:40:38,055 --> 01:40:42,716
桑蒂，这家伙杀人不眨眼，我向你保证

1102
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:46,319
那是麦克！杰弗里，是麦克！
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike. Oh, my God.

1103
01:40:46,397 --> 01:40:47,796
我的天

1104
01:40:52,603 --> 01:40:54,594
截下他了，麦克

1105
01:40:56,106 --> 01:40:58,074
快从车里滚出来
Get outta the car! Come on! Get outta there!

1106
01:40:58,108 --> 01:41:00,576
出来！滚出来！

1107
01:41:00,611 --> 01:41:02,579
居然敢和我抢女人，杂种
You stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass.

1108
01:41:02,613 --> 01:41:04,581
该好好给你点颜色瞧瞧
Right here, in front of your own stupid house. Get outta here!

1109
01:41:04,615 --> 01:41:06,845
就在你自己家门口给你点教训

1110
01:41:06,884 --> 01:41:08,010
快出来！
Mike, stop it.

1111
01:41:08,052 --> 01:41:09,519
麦克，住手！
Shut up! Just shut up, all right? Nobody's talkin' to you.

1112
01:41:09,553 --> 01:41:11,521
闭嘴！闭会嘴，好吗？

1113
01:41:11,555 --> 01:41:13,022
没人和你说话

1114
01:41:13,057 --> 01:41:14,524
来吧
Come on, Mike. Look, I don't wanna cause any problems.

1115
01:41:14,558 --> 01:41:17,527
我还不想惹麻烦

1116
01:41:17,594 --> 01:41:20,062
那是谁？是你老妈吗？
- Who's that? Is that your mother? - Dorothy.

1117
01:41:20,097 --> 01:41:21,189
桃乐茜！
- No, come here, you lvy League shit. - She's hurt, in case you didn't notice.

1118
01:41:21,265 --> 01:41:23,233
给我过来，你这陀屎

1119
01:41:23,267 --> 01:41:24,700
放开我！
Dorothy Vallens?

1120
01:41:24,735 --> 01:41:26,635
桃乐茜华伦？

1121
01:41:34,745 --> 01:41:36,235
来吧
Come on.

1122
01:41:46,123 --> 01:41:48,921
我真的…我很抱歉
I'm really... Hey, I'm sorry.

1123
01:41:51,328 --> 01:41:54,297
我很抱歉，我不知道
I'm really sorry. I didn't know. I'm really sorry.

1124
01:41:54,331 --> 01:41:56,265
没关系
- It's OK. It's OK. - I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

1125
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:58,325
我还以为你会杀了他

1126
01:41:58,402 --> 01:41:59,926
我们得带她离开这里
We've gotta get her outta here.

1127
01:42:00,003 --> 01:42:01,470
带她去我家
Go to my house. My father can get an ambulance fast.

1128
01:42:01,505 --> 01:42:03,473
我父亲很快就能找来救护车
- His partner won't be there, will he? - Probably not. Why?

1129
01:42:03,507 --> 01:42:05,475
他的拍档该不会在吧？

1130
01:42:05,509 --> 01:42:06,908
很难说，怎么？
- Nothing. - Watch out for Mike.

1131
01:42:06,944 --> 01:42:08,844
没什么

1132
01:42:08,879 --> 01:42:11,473
小心麦克

1133
01:42:11,515 --> 01:42:13,710
天
Oh, God.

1134
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,116
是你吗，杰弗里？
Is that you, Jeffrey?

1135
01:42:16,153 --> 01:42:17,518
对，是我
Yeah. It's me.

1136
01:42:17,789 --> 01:42:19,745
Oh, Jeffrey...

1137
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,283
Jeffrey...

1138
01:42:29,466 --> 01:42:31,934
爸！妈！
Dad? Mom?

1139
01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:34,470
我在这儿，宝贝
- I'm in here, honey. - Mom!

1140
01:42:34,538 --> 01:42:36,836
好了，马上就来
All right, I'll be right there.

1141
01:42:36,874 --> 01:42:38,842
爸爸在家吗？
- Is Dad home? - No. He oughta...

1142
01:42:38,876 --> 01:42:41,344
不在，他走…

1143
01:42:41,378 --> 01:42:45,007
你得快叫救护车来
You better call him. And... get an ambulance.

1144
01:42:45,048 --> 01:42:46,675
你们这是去哪儿了？
Where have you been?

1145
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:49,311
天
Oh, God.

1146
01:42:49,353 --> 01:42:52,151
天，他们伤了你
Oh, God, they've hurt him. Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

1147
01:42:52,189 --> 01:42:55,852
杰弗里！抱着我！没事了

1148
01:42:54,364 --> 01:42:56,689
- Hold me! Hold me! - It's OK, it's OK.

1149
01:42:55,893 --> 01:42:57,485
抱着我！天！

1150
01:43:02,599 --> 01:43:04,533
我的神秘情人
My secret lover.

1151
01:43:06,537 --> 01:43:08,698
我已经叫了救护车
I've called for an ambulance. The police are on their way.

1152
01:43:08,739 --> 01:43:10,434
警察也马上就会到
Don't get the police!

1153
01:43:10,474 --> 01:43:12,374
不要报警！

1154
01:43:12,409 --> 01:43:15,401
不要！
Stop it!

1155
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:18,209
我爱你！你要爱我！
I love you! Love me!

1156
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:23,852
他在我身上留下了记号
He put his disease in me.

1157
01:43:23,887 --> 01:43:26,583
告诉我不会有事
Tell me it's all right I opened myself to you.

1158
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:28,955
我把自己都交给你了

1159
01:43:28,992 --> 01:43:31,085
告诉我不会有事
- Tell me it's all right. - Sandy, please...

1160
01:43:31,161 --> 01:43:32,822
桑蒂…
- Sandy? - I'll get a coat to put on her.

1161
01:43:32,896 --> 01:43:35,831
我去给她拿件外套来

1162
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:43,364
杰弗里，这是怎么了？
Jeffrey? What's going on here?

1163
01:43:43,407 --> 01:43:45,705
我会和你解释的
I'll tell you.

1164
01:43:45,742 --> 01:43:49,735
他们…他们把他的头伤得好重
They... they've hurt his head.

1165
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:51,247
是谁，桃乐茜？
Who, Dorothy?

1166
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:56,249
唐尼.救救他
Don. Help him.

1167
01:43:57,754 --> 01:43:59,517
救救他
Help him.

1168
01:44:00,757 --> 01:44:03,555
答应我你会去救他！
Promise me you'll help him!

1169
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:16,001
他在我身上做了记号
He put his disease in me.

1170
01:44:34,891 --> 01:44:36,654
你要和我们一起坐救护车走
Would you like to come in the ambulance?

1171
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:37,682
还是开自己车？
I'll be right with you.

1172
01:44:37,761 --> 01:44:39,729
我随后就来

1173
01:44:47,237 --> 01:44:49,205
我得走了
I should go.

1174
01:44:49,239 --> 01:44:50,570
那就快走
- Go. - Sandy...

1175
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:01,550
抱着我！
Hold me! I'm falling!

1176
01:45:01,585 --> 01:45:05,578
我要掉下去了！我要掉下去了！
I'm falling! Hold me!

1177
01:45:11,728 --> 01:45:13,696
你对我撒谎
- You lied to me. - Sandy, please, forgive me.

1178
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:17,632
桑蒂，求求你，原谅我

1179
01:45:17,701 --> 01:45:20,169
我爱你
I love you.

1180
01:45:20,237 --> 01:45:22,831
我原谅你，杰弗里
I forgive you, Jeffrey.

1181
01:45:28,045 --> 01:45:29,706
我爱你
I love you.

1182
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:36,382
天，我爱你
I love you.

1183
01:45:38,555 --> 01:45:40,523
我…
I... But I couldn't watch that.

1184
01:45:40,557 --> 01:45:43,048
但我看不下去

1185
01:45:48,732 --> 01:45:49,858
她没事吧？
- Is she OK? - Yeah, she's OK.

1186
01:45:49,933 --> 01:45:51,400
对，没事
Get your father. Tell him to send the police to Dorothy's apartment.

1187
01:45:51,468 --> 01:45:53,231
尽快找到你父亲

1188
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:55,670
让她派手下去桃乐茜的公寓

1189
01:45:55,706 --> 01:45:58,197
要他尽快，现在我得挂了
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

1190
01:45:58,241 --> 01:45:59,708
杰弗里，不要
- Jeffrey, no. - I have to.

1191
01:45:59,743 --> 01:46:01,472
我必须得走了
- I love you. - Oh, God, be careful.

1192
01:46:01,511 --> 01:46:02,705
我爱你

1193
01:46:02,746 --> 01:46:04,543
天，你要保重
I will, believe me.

1194
01:46:04,581 --> 01:46:06,014
会的，相信我

1195
01:46:17,297 --> 01:46:19,372
Where...

1196
01:46:22,232 --> 01:46:24,564
我的梦又算是什么？
Where is my dream?

1197
01:46:38,482 --> 01:46:40,609
这是紧急事件
Look, this is an emergency.

1198
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:42,675
他说有人受伤了
He said someone was hurt and he wants Detective Williams there.

1199
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:45,449
他想要威廉斯探长能在场

1200
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:47,855
我们也不知道…这时候他在哪里
We do not know his whereabouts at this time.

1201
01:46:47,891 --> 01:46:49,586
那就去找他！
Well, find him!

1202
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:49,371
快退后趴下
Get back and stay down.

1203
01:48:52,716 --> 01:48:56,514
这是弗兰克布斯住的26号公寓
He's going to apartment 26.

1204
01:48:56,553 --> 01:48:59,681
警官，我们现在在弗兰克地方了
Lieutenant, we're at Frank's place now. The raid has commenced, as scheduled.

1205
01:48:59,723 --> 01:49:02,191
按原计划进行

1206
01:49:06,296 --> 01:49:07,661
原地待命
Stay in place.

1207
01:49:08,285 --> 01:49:12,032
Love letters straight from your heart

1208
01:49:12,969 --> 01:49:15,597
25号是空屋，可以从那里走
Number 25 is vacant, so maybe we can go through there.

1209
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,827
Keep us so near

1210
01:49:22,713 --> 01:49:24,623
While apart

1211
01:49:30,596 --> 01:49:33,265
I'm not alone

1212
01:49:33,765 --> 01:49:37,135
In the night

1213
01:49:40,463 --> 01:49:42,988
就让他们自己来找你吧
I'm gonna let them find you on their own.

1214
01:49:41,856 --> 01:49:44,940
When I can have

1215
01:49:45,026 --> 01:49:48,110
All the love

1216
01:49:48,195 --> 01:49:51,729
You write

1217
01:49:53,116 --> 01:49:55,987
I memorise

1218
01:49:56,787 --> 01:49:58,614
Every line

1219
01:51:29,506 --> 01:51:30,837
老天

1220
01:51:45,055 --> 01:51:48,547
威廉斯警官！
Detective Williams.

1221
01:51:46,386 --> 01:51:50,169
- Detective Williams? - Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

1222
01:51:48,591 --> 01:51:51,059
这是威廉斯探长，是你吗，杰弗里？

1223
01:51:51,094 --> 01:51:54,530
对，我藏在桃乐茜华伦的住所
Yeah, it's me. I'm hiding in Dorothy Vallens' apartment.

1224
01:51:54,564 --> 01:51:57,099
弗兰克化妆成那个衣冠楚楚的家伙上来了
Frank is on his way in a well-dressed-man disguise. I've got no way out...

1225
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,534
我现在无路可退…

1226
01:51:59,569 --> 01:52:01,628
他有无线电
He's got a radio.

1227
01:52:02,608 --> 01:52:03,639
Jeffrey!

1228
01:52:07,744 --> 01:52:10,110
威廉斯探长？
Detective Williams? I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

1229
01:52:10,146 --> 01:52:14,378
我就藏在卧室里，请尽快赶到

1230
01:52:12,283 --> 01:52:14,359
Please hurry.

1231
01:52:27,464 --> 01:52:29,762
嗨，好邻居
Hey, neighbour. You shit-for-brains, man! You forgot I have a police radio!

1232
01:52:29,799 --> 01:52:32,063
你真是蠢货！

1233
01:52:32,102 --> 01:52:35,263
你居然忘了…我有警方的无线电

1234
01:52:37,373 --> 01:52:39,432
这个衣冠楚楚的家伙
One well-dressed fuckin' man knows where your fuckin' cute little butt's hidin'.

1235
01:52:39,476 --> 01:52:44,273
知道你那可爱的小屁股藏在哪儿

1236
01:52:44,514 --> 01:52:46,846
你这个蠢杂种
Stupid fuck.

1237
01:52:48,518 --> 01:52:50,509
想跟我玩！
Fuck with me, man.

1238
01:53:01,264 --> 01:53:03,232
我进来了
Here I come, ready or not.

1239
01:53:04,567 --> 01:53:06,694
准备好没有

1240
01:53:06,736 --> 01:53:11,696
按计划进行

1241
01:53:11,741 --> 01:53:14,039
混蛋！
You fuck!

1242
01:53:14,077 --> 01:53:18,844
我听的到你说的话，蠢货！
I can hear your fuckin' radio, you stupid shit!

1243
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:21,908
你活不久了，伙计
You got about one fuckin' second to live, buddy!

1244
01:53:23,953 --> 01:53:26,854
你会觉得抱歉的，先生
You're one sorry piece of shit, mister.

1245
01:53:34,564 --> 01:53:38,056
真漂亮，真漂亮！
Hey, pretty, pretty!

1246
01:53:46,543 --> 01:53:49,011
他妈的！你躲到哪儿去了？
What the fuck... Where are you? Where are you?

1247
01:53:49,045 --> 01:53:50,706
你在哪儿？

1248
01:54:57,266 --> 01:54:59,472
Oh, Jeffrey.

1249
01:55:08,258 --> 01:55:10,055
都结束了，杰弗里
It's all over, Jeffrey.

1250
01:55:52,941 --> 01:56:00,236
And kiss for ever

1251
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:07,785
In a darkness

1252
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:16,667
And the mysteries of love

1253
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:25,801
Come clear

1254
01:56:25,887 --> 01:56:32,968
And dance

1255
01:56:34,269 --> 01:56:41,103
In light

1256
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:44,604
In you

1257
01:56:45,855 --> 01:56:48,187
杰弗里，午餐准备好了
- Jeffrey, lunch is ready. - OK.

1258
01:56:51,077 --> 01:56:54,659
In me

1259
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:58,871
And show

1260
01:56:59,168 --> 01:57:00,626
That we...

1261
01:57:00,837 --> 01:57:02,532
你们这是在干什么？
- How you guys doin'? - Hey, Jeffrey.

1262
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:08,166
- Hey, Jeff. Feelin' much better now, Jeff. - Good deal, Dad.

1263
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:07,904
我感觉好多了，杰弗

1264
01:57:07,944 --> 01:57:09,571
是的，爸爸

1265
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,648
桑蒂，你看
Sandy, look.

1266
01:57:18,388 --> 01:57:19,514
午餐时间
Lunchtime.

1267
01:57:19,555 --> 01:57:22,524
好的，杰弗里　　　听起来不错
- OK, Jeffrey. - Sounds good.

1268
01:57:22,558 --> 01:57:24,685
快过来看看这个
Jeffrey, come over here and look at this.

1269
01:57:26,829 --> 01:57:28,387
看！
Look.

1270
01:57:29,432 --> 01:57:32,367
我在外面见过他
Yeah, I saw him outside.

1271
01:57:32,435 --> 01:57:34,995
也许知更鸟都来了
Maybe the robins are here.

1272
01:57:36,305 --> 01:57:39,035
我不明白…它们是怎么办到的
I don't see how they could do that. I could never eat a bug.

1273
01:57:39,075 --> 01:57:43,305
换了我，是怎么也吞不下虫子的

1274
01:57:43,579 --> 01:57:47,948
这世界无奇不有，对吗？
It's a strange world.

1275
01:57:46,252 --> 01:57:48,328
Isn't it?

1276
01:57:53,508 --> 01:58:00,175
Sometimes a wind blows

1277
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:08,388
And the mysteries of love

1278
01:58:09,106 --> 01:58:16,815
Come clear

1279
01:58:42,638 --> 01:58:48,270
而我依然可见
And I still can see

1280
01:58:48,311 --> 01:58:52,611
蓝丝绒
Blue velvet

1281
01:58:52,648 --> 01:59:02,250
透过我的眼泪
Through

1282
01:58:54,771 --> 01:58:57,060
My

1283
01:58:57,149 --> 01:59:01,313
Tears

1284
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:24,750
