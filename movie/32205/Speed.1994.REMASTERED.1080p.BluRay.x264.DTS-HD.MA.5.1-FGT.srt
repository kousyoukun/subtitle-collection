1
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,780
片名：生死时速

2
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,400
[ 小 心 ]

3
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,030
嘿  这儿不能进来
Hey, this area's restricted.

4
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,530
嗨  你好  是他们通知我来的
Hi. Yeah, I know. They called me down here.

5
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,410
让我来检查线路
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

6
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,910
怎么没人通知我  给我看一下单据
Nobody called it down to me. I'm gonna have to see a work order.

7
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,870
好  请稍等
Yeah. Just a second.

8
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
看吧
There you are.

9
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,300
你自找的
Nothing personal.

10
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,770
今天就到这儿吧  诸位辛苦了
Well, I guess that wraps it up. Good work, everybody.

11
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,480
马提  我认为你这计划很好
Marty, I couldn't be happier with the way this worked out.

12
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,860
衷心祝贺你
Congratulations.

13
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,660
别关
Hold that.

14
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,830
谢谢你支持
Gee, thanks.

15
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,460
多谢你帮忙  鲍布
Thanks for pushing that, Bob. The light's on,

16
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,300
不过要是指示灯坏了也说不定呢
but you never know, it might be broken.

17
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,170
别胡说
Shut up.

18
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,190
知道吗  亲爱的  今天会上...
Remember, honey...

19
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,650
我的天  鲍布  你按了什么钮?
Jesus. Bob, what button did you push?

20
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,660
这幢楼里其它电梯是不是都停止使用了?
Mr Bagwell, make sure these other elevators remain locked down and empty.

21
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,370
除了维修窗  现在没有任何地方可以进入电梯
There's no doors, no other way in or out, except through access panels, correct?

22
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,630
现在有十三位乘客被困在电梯里  在三十层不到
What we have here are 13 passengers in an express elevator below floor 30.

23
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,260
缆绳被炸断了  案犯向我们提出要三百万元的赎金
Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants $3 million or he blows the brakes.

24
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,050
- 给多少时间?  - 就一个小时
- What's our clock? - He gave one hour.

25
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,640
可现在只剩下二十三分钟了
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

26
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,770
不能让电梯再坠落下去
Anything to keep this elevator from falling?

27
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,060
底层
The basement.

28
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,150
当局要防止惨剧发生
We'd like to avoid that, Traven.

29
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,610
- 要想办法把人救出来  - 那可是架高速电梯
- We can't unload the passengers? - This is an express elevator.

30
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,740
案犯把炸药安装在启动闸上
The only way in is through access panels. The bomber's wired the hatch,

31
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,990
他随时都可以让电梯坠落
which seats him in the "crazy but not stupid" section.

32
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,450
哈里要求到现场去看一下
Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device.

33
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,410
- 没错  - 好吧  你们俩一起去
- Yeah, right. - Fine. The two of you check it out.

34
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
离电梯最近的维修窗在第三十二层
The nearest access panel's on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

35
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,960
摸清情况  不许擅自行动
I want reports only. We're in a holding pattern.

36
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,340
沃西  比格  你们两个去守住大门
Worthy, Briggs, secure the base area.

37
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,550
其他人  尽快把楼里人疏散出去  快行动
Everyone else, I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

38
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,550
爬楼吧
Looks like we're walkin'.

39
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,890
- 快点  快点  留神脚下  - 二十九
- Hurry, but watch your step! - 29.

40
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,060
到底下大厅  快一点
All the way down to the lobby! Let's go, folks!

41
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,100
三十
30.

42
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
三十一
31.

43
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,030
三十二
32.

44
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,090
喂
Hello?

45
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,100
- 快让我们出去  - 喂  喂
- Come on! Get us outta here! - Hello! Hello!

46
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,340
来人  快来人  让我们出去
Help! Please, get us out of here!

47
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,760
来人啊
Please!

48
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,120
来人  让我们出去
Please! Get us out of here!

49
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,960
上面有人吗?  有人吗?  这是怎么了?
Who's up there? Who's up there? What's going on?

50
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,750
女士们  先生们  我们是警察
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD.

51
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,220
- 谢天谢地  - 你们来干什么?
- Thank God. - What are you doing up there?

52
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,680
这架电梯出了点故障  大家别紧张
There's been an elevator malfunction, so just relax.

53
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,270
快点  快点想想办法
Hey, come on! What are you guys waiting for?

54
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,190
别急  你们很快能出来
We'll have you out of there as soon as possible.

55
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,350
我骗人?
Am I lying?

56
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,860
干嘛派警察来?  警察会修电梯?
How come they sent cops here? Shouldn't they send repair guys?

57
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,450
你怎么想?
What do you think?

58
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,170
- 听你的  你是专家  - 干得很巧妙
- You're the expert. I just work here. - Looks pretty solid.

59
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,050
- 像谁干的?  - 不知道  可准是个老手
- Anyone we know? - I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro.

60
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,380
- 时间不多了  - 真急人
- He's cutting it close. - I don't like it.

61
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,390
急也没用  麦克让等只好等
Well, what's to like? Mac said we hold, so we hold.

62
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,280
临时测试  机场  案犯挟持一名人质朝前跑
All right, pop quiz. The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

63
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,820
眼看要到机舱口
He's using her for cover. He's almost to a plane.

64
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,370
你还在百米之外
You're 100 feet away.

65
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,290
杰克
Jack.

66
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,210
打伤人质
Shoot the hostage.

67
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,130
- 什么?  - 先朝人质开枪
- What? - Take her out of the equation.

68
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,340
把人质打伤再瞄准案犯  就这样
Go for the good wound and he can't get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

69
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,220
真亏你想得出来  朝人质开枪  哼
You're deeply nuts, you know that? "Shoot the hostage. "

70
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,560
有点不对劲  他打算炸电梯
Harry, this is wrong. He's gonna blow it anyway.

71
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,940
- 怎么知道?  - 只是凭直觉
- Why? - I don't know. Gut feeling.

72
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,240
行了  等着麦克下命令  沉住气
Right now Mac outranks your gut, so we sit.

73
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,160
怎么还没有修好?
This is taking way too long.

74
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,160
这电梯重量多少?
How much d'you think that elevator weighs?

75
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,330
杰克  得了
Jack, come on.

76
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,920
我有个主意  也许有点用
Maybe we can do something about those hostages.

77
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,840
想朝人质开枪?
We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?

78
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,260
嗨  去哪儿?  这是怎么了?
Hey, where you going? What's going on?

79
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,680
别走  别离开我们
Don't go! Don't leave us here!

80
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,360
不  我想帮他们摆脱困境
No, we just take them out of the equation.

81
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,360
- 能行吗?  - 可以
- Are you sure it'll hold? - It'll hold.

82
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,690
六分钟
Six minutes.

83
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,200
不能再这么拖下去了  他又不答话
I can't get any more time. He's not talking!

84
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,490
赶快把赎金送过来
I need the goddamn money now.

85
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,010
你说说  哈里  我这是图个什么?
Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job?

86
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,300
图个退休之后能领那点养老金和一块镀金表
Oh, come on. 30 more years of this, you get a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

87
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,100
对
Cool.

88
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,670
- 天呐  这儿真热  - 透不过气
- God, it's hot in here. - There's no air.

89
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,760
- 把门撬开不就行了?  - 憋死了
- Can't they just pry the doors open? - I can't breathe.

90
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,850
别想跟老子较量
Don't fuck with Daddy.

91
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,640
这一下可全完了
Usually they fall down now.

92
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,610
提前了  那杂种提前了
He's early. The son of a bitch is early!

93
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,340
麦克  再派几个人来
Mac, we need more help up here now!

94
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,470
开开门  救救我  我不想死
Oh, please! I don't wanna die!

95
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,670
快开门
Please save us!

96
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,060
快开门  开门
Open the door! Open the door, please!

97
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,360
- 帮帮我  帮帮我  - 我们救你出去
- Please help me! - We'll get you out!

98
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,490
- 快  把手伸过来  没事  - 拉住我
- Give me your hands! It's OK. - Pull me through.

99
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,250
当心头  当心头
Watch your head. Watch your head.

100
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,250
- 出来了  出来了  - 别紧张
- OK, I've got you. - Take it easy.

101
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,090
- 没事了  - 谢谢  谢谢
- You're fine. You're fine. - Thank you.

102
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,010
- 好了  好了  扶一下  - 快  下一个
- Take her. - Who's next?

103
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,260
谢谢
Thank you.

104
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,010
抓住你了
We've got you, ma'am.

105
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,940
- 这是怎么回事?  - 离开这儿  快
- What the hell is all this? - Help us! Hurry!

106
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,200
走  走  快走
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

107
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,950
快点  快点
Come on. Come on.

108
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,500
我的天
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

109
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,920
- 帮帮我  - 当心头  当心
- Help me out! Please, help me out. - Watch your head.

110
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,670
- 过来  快  - 不  不
- Come on, lady! - No.

111
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,460
过来  快过来  拉住我  快
Come on, lady! Come on! Grab my hand!

112
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,270
- 快过来  要坠下去了  - 不
- Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall! - No!

113
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,600
不  我怕
No, I can't!

114
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,150
迈一步  伸出手拉住我
Just take one step, reach out and take my hand.

115
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,980
过来  过来
Come on! Come on!

116
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,240
- 上帝  别抛弃我  - 没事了
- Oh, God! Don't let go of me! - You're OK.

117
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,670
我的鞋子
My shoe!

118
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,090
觉得怎么样?
Was it good for you?

119
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,220
一场虚惊  你说呢  什么滋味儿?
It was great for me. How was it for you, honey?

120
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,430
- 电梯坠落了  - 刺激  太刺激了
- Elevator dropped. - Good. That's good to know.

121
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,320
- 你表慢了?  - 不  不  他提前了
- Is your watch slow? - No. He jumped the gun.

122
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,950
- 提前了三分钟  - 他干嘛呢?
- We had three minutes left. - Why does he do that?

123
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,860
不要这三百万
He's losing his $3 million.

124
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,780
谁知道  也许兴奋得昏了头
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough.

125
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,290
听说这个毛病  上了年纪的人容易犯
It's a common problem among middle-aged men. So I'm told.

126
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
他在
He's here.

127
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,260
可能躲在别的地方遥控
He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.

128
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,430
不  他一直监视我们  在附近
No. He knew we were up to something. He's close by.

129
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,730
他疯狂可并不蠢  再说楼里人都疏散了
He's not gonna corner himself in a building we evacuated anyway. Come on.

130
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,030
要不可能在便于转移的地方  对吗?
He'd wanna be here, but he'd wanna stay mobile, right?

131
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,530
在电梯里
The elevators.

132
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,370
客用电梯都锁了  不会在那儿
Passenger cars were stopped. They checked 'em out.

133
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,580
可货用电梯没锁
What about the freight elevators?

134
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,900
- 神秘客人要现身了  - 什么?
- Will the mystery guest please sign in? - What?

135
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,030
杰克
Jack!

136
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,820
妈的
Damn it.

137
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,910
靠边  快靠边
Get to the side!

138
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,090
妈的  妈的  妈的
Shit! Shit! Shit!

139
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,510
起来  给我滚起来
Up! Get your ass up!

140
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,810
恐怕他们是不会为了赎你  给我三百万美金的
I don't suppose anybody'll give me three million just for you.

141
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,570
别动
Hold it!

142
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,780
临时测验  年轻人  恐怖分子浑身绑着炸弹
Pop quiz, hotshot. Terrorist holding a police hostage.

143
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,290
抓了个警察作人质  扬言要炸毁大楼
Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to blow a building in half.

144
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,200
你怎么办呢?
Now what do you do?

145
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,370
楼底下有五十名警察在等着你呢
There's gonna be 50 cops waiting for you in the basement.

146
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,670
这部署完全符合标准
Standard flanking deployment, right?

147
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,760
我们得靠他们近点  呃?  来个小花招
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor, huh? At least that's what they'll think.

148
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,140
检查一下刚才哪儿在打枪  布里斯  杰克他们呢?
I want location on those goddamn shots! Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

149
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,730
警长  货用电梯里梯有情况
Lieutenant, we've got movement on the freight elevator.

150
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,690
停在三楼  快上去
It's on three. Let's move!

151
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,370
说实在的  今天真是太令人失望了
End of the line. This day has been real disappointing, I don't mind saying.

152
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,330
因为你一个人也没杀掉?
Because you didn't kill everyone?

153
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,330
总有那么一天  伙计  你们会后悔见过我
There will come a time, boy, when you'll wish you'd never met me.

154
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,460
我现在已经很后悔了
Mister, I'm already there.

155
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,880
主动权在我的手上  我只要一扔这个  你的朋友就成一堆血浆
I'm in charge here. I drop this stick and they pick your friend up with a sponge.

156
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,470
- 你准备好了吗  伙计?  - 他妈的
- Are you ready to die, friend? - Fuck you.

157
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,970
两百年前有人说  "我后悔把生命献给国家"
In 200 years, we've come from "I regret but I have one life to give for my country"

158
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,180
现在简化成  "他妈的"
to "fuck you"?

159
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,440
- 少说废话  快扔  快扔  - 闭嘴  哈里
- Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it. - Shut up, Harry.

160
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,730
真是一条不怕死的好汉  伙计
We've got all the balls in the world right here, man.

161
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,940
快投降  你别想跑出去
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

162
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,610
朝人质开枪啊
Shoot the hostage.

163
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,070
告别吧  哈里
Say goodbye, Harry.

164
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,750
见你的鬼
You fuck!

165
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,580
别动
Freeze!

166
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,630
别动
Freeze!

167
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,670
快投降  你跑不了了
Give it up! You're out of options!

168
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,700
本着无畏和奉献的精神  这两位警察
Through dedication and bravery, these next two officers effected the rescue

169
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,200
拯救了本市十三位公民的生命
of 13 citizens of this city.

170
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,290
由于他们  那凶手葬身于自己设置的炸弹中
And, thanks to them, the only life taken by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

171
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,090
你竟然敢朝我开枪
You shot me. I can't believe it.

172
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,340
还为这个发给你勋章  混蛋
They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick.

173
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,890
哈里  你叫我开的
Harry, you told me to.

174
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,470
奖给洛杉矶警察局的成员
...the Los Angeles Police Department.

175
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,390
警官  哈里·坦波
Officer Harry Temple.

176
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,990
警官  杰克·特莱文
Officer Jack Traven.

177
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,100
好样儿的  杰克  好样儿的
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

178
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,180
- 拿着  拿着  - 哈里  给
- There we go. - Harry, my man.

179
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,310
好极了  干了它  痛痛快快地喝吧
Beautiful. A toast to me. Make me feel good about myself.

180
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,150
山迪  多喝点
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

181
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,400
嘿  怎么样?
OK, so how we doing? Whoa, whoa.

182
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,530
给我餐巾
Shit. I need a bib!

183
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,700
- 多喝点  喝吧  - 喝吧  喝吧
- Here we go. All right. - You can't take me anywhere.

184
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,080
这杯  我敬哈里
And here is to Harry,

185
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,210
为他的灵敏
for his quick thinking,

186
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,420
还为他的顾大局  以及他的无私和勇敢
for his grace under pressure and for his brave and selfless act.

187
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,920
对  干  干
Hear! Hear!

188
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,890
另外  为杰克朝哈里开枪
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

189
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,930
在座各位早就盼着朝他开枪了
Something we've all wanted to do for a very long time.

190
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,600
嘿  嘿  嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

191
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,730
好了  说正经的
OK, no, no. Here it is.

192
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,440
为了二位尽心尽责  还能死里逃生  干杯
Here's to you guys for doing yourjob and for not getting dead.

193
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,320
干杯
Mazel tov.

194
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,120
我们是天下最幸运的人
We are the two luckiest guys in the world.

195
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,170
那个混蛋给炸死了  电梯里的人都没事
We got the bad guy and we didn't lose any civilians.

196
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,500
- 对  干得好  - 不  是运气好
- We're good. - No. You were lucky.

197
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,380
对  运气好  你心里该清楚
No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it.

198
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,130
那家伙是个狡猾的疯子
We were dealing with a total psycho.

199
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,350
当时我们俩差一点让他给炸死
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

200
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,770
我挨了一枪  不是吗?
And I got a bullet in me.

201
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,400
只差六英寸  就该我老婆上台领奖了
Six inches off the mark, and they're giving the medal to my wife.

202
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,820
哈里  我是说  我们赢了他
Harry, come on, man. I mean, we won. We got him.

203
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,820
你是没听?  还是怎么了?
Do you listen? Do you ever?

204
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,660
要知道  我不能够老跟着你  掩护你  你得多用脑子
Because I am not gonna be around to back you up, so you better start thinking.

205
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,160
不能光凭直觉  否则会送命的
Guts'll get you so far, and then they'll get you killed.

206
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,500
好运不会老跟着你的  对吧  头儿?
Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief?

207
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,170
对
That's right.

208
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,550
没事  没事  我想回家  也想老婆
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm gonna go home, have some sex.

209
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,310
- 哈里  你到家就会吐  - 那也挺有意思的
- Harry, you're gonna go home and puke. - Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

210
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,850
我送送你
Come on, you gimp.

211
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,840
杰克  我看电视了  恭喜你呀
Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations.

212
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
谢谢  鲍布
Thanks, Bob.

213
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,380
- 你胖了  - 行了  鲍布  别逗他
- You looked fat. - Take it easy on him, Bob.

214
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,760
- 他昨晚一宵没睡  - 狂欢了一宵  呃?
- The boy was up late last night partying. - Wild party, huh?

215
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,720
是啊  闹了一宵
I don't remember that well.

216
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,180
一觉醒来还是光棍
Couldn't have been too great. Woke up alone.

217
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,350
是吗?  记得我有次闹一宵  醒来有了老婆
Yeah? The last time I partied like that, I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

218
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,320
嗨  杰克  你忘了松糕
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

219
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,610
- 祝你好运  鲍布  - 谢谢  你多保重
- Have a good one, Bob. - Thanks, Jack. Take care.

220
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,030
谢谢
Thanks.

221
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,540
明儿见
See you tomorrow.

222
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,330
怎么样  杰克?
What do you think, Jack?

223
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,380
你不去把司机的牙捡出来  再得一枚勋章?
You think if you pick up all the bus driver's teeth, they'll give you another medal?

224
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
天呐
Jesus!

225
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,130
你当好我对付是吗?
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

226
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,550
上次电梯的事我准备了整整两年
Two years I spent setting up that elevatorjob.

227
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,970
我把我的一切都投了进去
Two years I invested myself in it.

228
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,930
你想象不出  我耗费了多少心血
You couldn't understand the kind of commitment that I have.

229
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,270
你等于毁了我一生  你以为我会这么轻易地放过你?
You ruined a man's life's work and you think you can walk away?

230
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,480
别做梦了  我引起你的重视了  对吗  杰克?
You got blinders on to the world, but I got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

231
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,320
- 你干嘛不冲我来呢?  - 为了我自己  为了我的钱
- Why didn't you just come after me? - This is about me. This is about my money.

232
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,370
你们欠我一大笔债  我得讨回来
This is about money due me, which I will collect.

233
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,660
一共是三百七十万美金
$3.7 million.

234
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,160
像我这把年纪的人  杰克  得为将来做打算
It's my nest egg, Jack. At my age, you gotta think ahead.

235
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,250
- 等我把你抓住...  - 临时测验  年轻人
- When I find you... - Pop quiz, hotshot.

236
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,130
一辆巴士有炸弹
There's a bomb on a bus.

237
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,420
当时速超过五十英里的时候  炸弹启动
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed.

238
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,470
再降到五十英里  就会爆炸
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

239
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,930
你怎么办?  你怎么办?
What do you do? What do you do?

240
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,020
- 你说的是哪辆巴士?  - 你认为我会告诉你吗?
- I'd wanna know what bus it was. - You think I'm gonna tell you that?

241
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,110
- 是的  - 这很好
- Yes. - Very good.

242
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,610
有几条游戏规则  杰克  你必须完全照办
There are rules, Jack, and I want you to get this right.

243
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,150
不许乘客离开汽车
No one goes off the bus.

244
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,280
你要是企图让任何人下车  我就会引爆炸弹
You try to take any passengers off the bus, I will detonate it.

245
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,870
在十一点之前把钱给我
I want my money by 11 am.

246
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,630
- 这点时间怕来不及  - 注意听  杰克
- We can't pull that kind of money in time. - Focus, Jack!

247
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,760
你只要管那辆车  车上没有电话  无线电坏了
Your concern is the bus. And don't try to call. The radio's down.

248
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,970
好  那辆车牌号是二五二五  正从洛杉矶西区开往北区
Now, the number of the bus is 2525. It's running downtown from Venice.

249
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,310
在海洋公司和三线交叉
It is at the corner of Ocean Park and Main.

250
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,280
山姆
Sam!

251
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,740
山姆
Sam!

252
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,240
安妮
Annie.

253
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,200
山姆  快停下
Sam! Tell him to stop!

254
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,420
妈的  让我上去
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through! Sam!

255
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,420
- 山姆  - 这又不是车站
- Sam! - This ain't no bus stop.

256
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,710
- 是啊  - 把烟扔了  安妮
- Come on. - Get rid of your butt, Annie.

257
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,430
好  扔了  扔了
OK, it's gone, it's gone.

258
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,600
你是个大好人  将来大家会歌颂你的
You are a good, kind man. One day people are gonna write songs about you.

259
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,480
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

260
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,450
- 头一次来这儿  - 不  我住这儿
- First time in LA. - Oh, no. I live here.

261
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,920
我说自己  真是有意思
No, I mean mine. Oh, that's just funny.

262
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
- 你听错了  我来游览  - 是吗
- You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing. - Oh, really?

263
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,220
是啊  我不爱说来"旅游"  可其实是来旅游
Yeah. I hate to use the word "tourist", but it's not like I can hide it.

264
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,340
确实不是
Not really.

265
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,470
天呐  从机场到这儿足足花了三个小时
Aw, jeez. You know, it took me three hours just to get here from the airport.

266
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,180
简直把我脑袋转晕了
I got so lost.

267
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,650
洛杉矶地方可真大  你住在这儿可能没体会
LA is one large place. Course, you live here. You probably don't notice.

268
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,280
我是外乡人  嘿  乡巴佬
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

269
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,740
你瞧  我座上粘着这个
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

270
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,110
胶姆糖
Gum.

271
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,160
对不起
Excuse me.

272
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,330
- 早  - 你好
- Morning. - Hi.

273
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,690
我最不愿意车开上高速公路
I just couldn't handle the freeways any more.

274
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,860
太紧张了
I got so tense.

275
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,940
我希望能轻轻松松地去上班
This way, I can just relax all the way to work.

276
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,900
是啊  我的那辆车  就给撞坏了
Yeah, well, I love my car. I miss my car.

277
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,750
上帝  又堵上了
Oh, God. Look at that.

278
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,590
- 山姆  - 妈的
- Hey, Sam! - Shit.

279
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,510
- 山姆  - 什么事?
- Sam! - What?

280
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,720
你干嘛不从空档绕过这些车?
Why don't you just drive over these people?

281
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,350
用不着你指挥  安妮
Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

282
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,600
车真多
Such a mess.

283
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,160
停下
Stop!

284
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,500
- 开开门  开门  - 走开  这儿不是车站不能停
- Open up! - Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

285
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,670
- 他也许有什么急事  - 快开门  停车
- That guy really wants to get on the bus. - Open up! Stop!

286
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,470
- 山姆  别让他上来  - 我是警察
- Don't, Sam! Don't let him on! - LAPD!

287
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,550
- 听不见  - 你快停车
- I can't hear you! - Stop this bus!

288
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,550
什么?
What?

289
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,600
我是警察  快停下来
LAPD! Stop the bus!

290
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,140

292
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,690
- 我是警察  你快把车给我  - 我说  这辆车是我的
- Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car. - Jesus, not again.

293
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,320
这车是我的  不是偷来的
This is my car. I own this car. It's not stolen.

294
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,160
- 少废话  让开  - 妈的
- It is now. Move over. - Fuck!

295
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,080
我说  你要碰坏了它
Man, you scratch this puppy, and me and you

296
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,830
那我就跟你没个完  懂了吗?
are gonna have words, you understand?

297
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,690
听我说  别开得太快  好吗?  速度稍微放慢一点
OK, look, man, we don't have to go so fast. Just slow down a little bit.

298
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,860
稍微慢点  妈的
Oh, shit. Come on, man.

299
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,030
别碰坏我的车  好吗?
Just don't tear up my car, all right?

300
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,660
你稍微慢一点  行吗?
OK, OK. Just slow down just a bit, all right?

301
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,540
我们有什么必要开得这么快
We don't have to go so fast, do we? We don't have to go so...

302
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,710
你技术可真不赖  伙计
That was a nice move, man.

303
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,890
妈的
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

304
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,600
你慢一点好不好?  慢点

- Hold on, man. - Sam, lift your head.

388
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,790
- 小姐  会开巴士吗?  - 我想没问题  就像开大蓬车
- Can you handle this bus? - Sure. It's like driving a really big Pinto.

389
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,960
- 你能不能控制好它?  - 没问题  你有什么主意?
- I need to know! Can you handle it? - I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is.

390
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,260
- 你有主意吗?  - 暂时先这么开着
- Is there a plan? - For you to drive. We're OK for now.

391
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,680
- 时速别低于五十英里  - 好吧
- Just keep us above 50. - Good plan.

392
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,720
- 你真是个警察?  - 是的
- So, you're a cop, right? - That's right.

393
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:24,230
可以跟你说实话  我乘巴士是因为执照给吊销了
Well, I should probably tell you that I had my driver's licence revoked.

394
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,650
- 怎么会?  - 超速
- What for? - Speeding.

395
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,490
哈里  我们去现场了  有情况随时联系
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper. If anything changes, let us know.

396
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,490
有关资料全部都在这里
Anything we haven't seen should be in here.

397
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,860
到目前为止  我们知道至少有一辆崭新的美洲虎高级轿车
...wrong with the driver, but at least one car, a Jaguar,

398
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,990
被这辆高速行驶的大客车撞出数米远
has been driven off the road by the speeding bus.

399
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,660
这辆公交客车甚为奇特
The bus came onto the freeway at the Lincoln onramp.

400
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,580
到站均不停靠  车速保持在每小时六十英里左右
It began picking up speed, swerving, and hasn't slowed down since.

401
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,460
一名警官从一辆高速行驶的美洲虎内
Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus

402
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,960
纵身跳上了这辆巴士
byjumping onto it from a moving car.

403
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,710
准是你  杰克  嘿
Would that be you, Jack?

404
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,840
- 我怎么做?  - 看下各种仪器
- Where do we start? - The speedometer.

405
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,140
有没有损坏  松动  或者有什么  有没有电线?
Has it been fucked with or loosened? See any wires or anything?

406
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,100
对不起  小姐
Excuse me, ma'am.

407
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,270
不  没有
No, it's clean.

408
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,850
那就在车底下  很可能装在车轴上
Then it's gonna be under the bus. Probably rigged to one of the axles.

409
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,230
车底下没法检查  哈里  车正在行驶
I can't get under the bus right now. It's kind of in motion.

410
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,650
对不起
Excuse me! Excuse me!

411
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,780
等一下
Hold on.

412
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,660
车上  有一块...  出入板
Access panel... in the floor.

413
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,910
就在你脚下
Underneath you, man.

414
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,330
哈里  可以了  等我找个乘客
All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay.

415
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,250
先生  拿着这个  帮我传一下话
Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see.

416
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,800
好的
OK.

417
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,420
好了  我看见了  一个大炸弹
We got a wad! Pretty big!

418
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,390
- 有个大炸弹  - 是黄铜的
- There's a pretty big wad. - Brass fittings!

419
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:22,850
- 是黄铜的  - 我可以摸到炸弹的电线
- Brass fittings. - I think I can reach the circuit wire.

420
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,350
- 他可以摸到电线  - 不  别动  是圈套  典型的
- He can reach the circuit wire. - No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic.

421
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
- 是典型的圈套  - 还有什么?
- Classic decoy. - What else?

422
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,730
- 还有什么?  - 等一下
- What else? - Hold on.

423
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,940
等一下
Hold on.

424
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,160
真妈的
Fuck me!

425
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,790
有了
Oh, darn.

426
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,420
哈里  这玩艺儿  简直能把地球炸了大窟窿
Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world.

427
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,510
好吧  好  别慌  沉住气  还有什么?
OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

428
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,050
三个启动器  一个在轴上  看不清  一个遥控器
Three triggers -one on the axle I can't really see, a cellular remote

429
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,220
有块手表  可能是定时器
and a timer running off a wristwatch.

430
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,430
- 手表?  什么样的?  - 金的
- A watch? What kind of watch? - Gold.

431
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,480
廉价的镀金手表
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

432
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,100
警官
Officer!

433
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,610
- 警官  - 你在想什么?
- Officer! - What's on your mind, Harry?

434
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,900
怎么办?  警官
Shit. What do I do? Officer!

435
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,150
- 怎么办  怎么办?  - 妈的
- What do I do? - Oh, shit.

436
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,910
- 走哪儿?  走哪儿?  - 妈的  走边上
- Which way? Which way? - Get on the shoulder.

437
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,070
好的
OK.

438
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,170
留神
Watch it!

439
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:48,310
下高速公路?  要不要下去?
Stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?

440
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,390
下去  坐稳
Off! Off! Hold on!

441
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,580
上帝
Oh, God.

442
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,500
- 别停  - 红灯
- Keep going. - It's red!

443
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,130
过
Go! Go!

444
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,480
这下好多了
This is much better.

445
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,820
这辆公交大客车  从西区一直高速往南开
...city streets. The bus is on Western, heading in a southbound direction.

446
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,950
目前  沿途的交通秩序  受到严重破坏
Now, where the bus did exit here, it had a couple of close calls.

447
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,750
真是一场精彩球赛
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

448
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,170
不知道当局计划怎么做
We don't know what authorities plan to do.

449
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,840
我不明白
I don't get it.

450
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,310
用手表作计时器  为什么?  什么意思?
The watch is a shitty timer. Why use it? What's he saying?

451
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,730
- 手表几乎人人有  - 他手法不固定
- Lots of people have watches, Harry. - This guy has no MO.

452
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,610
这类案犯一般用惯了哪种炸药  每次作案就都会用它
A bomber falls in love with one kind of bomb and they're very monogamous.

453
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:21,280
可这人不一样  每次都别出心裁
This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger every time,

454
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,070
这次还用了块手表
and now he throws in this watch.

455
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,110
他对所有的炸药性能都了如指掌
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs. He knows every kind.

456
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,330
是啊  还熟悉拆除的方法
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

457
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,540
等一等
Wait a minute.

458
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,250
我需要看一下前十年的档案
I wanna look at the files for the last 10 years.

459
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:41,710
- 涉嫌犯的档案全查过了  - 不  要警察的
- We did the mug shots. It's not gonna help. - No. I wanna look at cops.

460
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,630
好吧  我们去
Come on. Let's go.

461
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,350
喂  麦克  你在哪儿?
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

462
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,270
我要离开公路了  我在市区
I had to bail on the freeway. We're in the city.

463
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,560
我看见你了  你就一直往前开
I can see you. Just keep going straight.

464
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:03,530
我会想办法为你开路的  跟我保持联系
I'm gonna try to clear the roads for you. Just stay on line.

465
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,620
妈的  我的天  上帝
Shit! Oh, Jesus! God! No!

466
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,740
往左
Go left!

467
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,750
- 对不起  - 上帝
- Sorry. - Oh, my God!

468
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,260
天呐
Oh, jeez!

469
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,140
都给我闪开
People, stay out of my way! Stay out of my way!

470
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,060
- 小姐  往右  - 好  好  好  我知道
- Ma'am, up to the right. - OK, OK, OK. I see it, I see it.

471
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,070
麦克  快带我离开这条路
Mac! Mac, you've gotta get me outta here!

472
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,530
再过几条路口  你就来个小转弯
A few more blocks, you're gonna come up to a soft turn. Right.

473
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,830
往右没有多远  有巡逻车队在等着你
Then hold straight. I've got some units waiting for you there.

474
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:59,920
他们会把你带到一零五公路  那条路还没有通车  是空的
They're gonna lead you to the 105 freeway. It's not in use. It'll be empty.

475
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,750
- 你就放心在上面开吧  - 知道了
- You'll be totally clear. - Got it.

476
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,970
再过几条马路我们往右拐
In a few blocks, we take the soft turn to the right.

477
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,560
好的  那巡逻车队在什么地方?
OK. Wait a minute. Escort to where? Where do we get an escort to?

478
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,730
小心
Look out!

479
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:21,900
我的天呐
Oh, God!

480
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,030
你这狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

481
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,660
上帝
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

482
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,410
- 我撞着了婴儿  -  罐头
- Oh, God! I just hit the baby! - Cans!

483
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,620
- 不是婴儿  是一车罐头  - 没事?  真的?
- There was no baby. It was full of cans. - Are you sure?

484
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,600
不  不  别过来
Oh, jeez. No! No! No!

485
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,990
- 回学校去  回学校去  - 麦克  车很堵
- Why aren't they at school? - Mac, we're boned.

486
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,950
带你们出去
I'll get you out, Jack.

487
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,550
好  听着  前面有个拐角
All right, listen. You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

488
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,430
你们得拐弯  难度非常大
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

489
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,640
- 有多难?  - 什么难?
- How ugly? - What's ugly?

490
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,640
一会儿我们往右拐  在前面一点
We got a hard right coming up at the construction site.

491
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,190
- 就是这儿  - 这儿没法拐
- This should be it. - That is a dead end.

492
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,690
- 我没这本事  - 你能行  靠左
- I can't make that turn. - You can make it. Keep left. Make it wide.

493
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,070
会翻车的  会翻车的
Oh, God. We're gonna tip over. We're gonna tip over.

494
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,070
会翻车的  大家都到车这边来  快
You're right. We're gonna tip over. Everyone on this side of the bus now!

495
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,990
都到这边来  尽量靠边  快
On this side of the bus! As far as you can, please.

496
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,160
坐稳了
Hold on!

497
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:05,540
尽量靠边  快  麦克  快把人都散开
Over here. Over here. As far as you can! Now! Mac, you better clear this site out.

498
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,130
- 大家坐稳了  - 往左  尽量往左靠
- Everybody hold on! - This side of the bus!

499
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,390
坐稳了
Hold on!

500
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,180
好  拐了  拐了
Hold on! Oh, God! Here we go! Here we go!

501
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:27,860
来吧
Here we go!

502
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,710
上帝  好了  都没事吧?
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Is everybody all right?

503
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,040
- 没事了  - 天呐
- Yes! - Oh, my God.

504
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,790
把我送到一零五公路口
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

505
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,560
差点死过去  太可怕了
Oh, my God. We might've died. I can't think.

506
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,310
没事  你要是想吐就吐出来吧
It's OK. If you need to, you go right ahead and vomit.

507
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,920
弗兰克  把那脚手架挪开换成网
Frank, get rid of that scaffolding and replace it with webbing.

508
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,010
把路面的障碍全部清除干净
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead. No obstructions in the freeway.

509
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:39,640
我要确保这条公路上畅通无阻
We have a window here. I wanna make sure it stays open.

510
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,990
妈的
Shoot.

511
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,870
你能帮我把一下这个方南盘吗?
Could you do me a favour and hold the wheel for me for a second?

512
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,370
好吗?
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

513
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,880
小姐  干得不错
Ma'am, you did very well.

514
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,590
简直不可思议  没见过这种开法
Actually, you were incredible. I've never seen driving like that.

515
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,380
- 安妮  - 什么?
- Annie. - What?

516
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,340
我的名字叫安妮
It's my name. Annie.

517
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,100
- 安妮  - 别叫我"小姐"
- Annie. - As opposed to "ma'am".

518
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,720
好吧
OK.

519
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,690
我说  这到底是怎么回事?
So, why is all this happening?

520
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,440
我们炸了他的家还是怎么的?
I mean, what did we do? Bomb the guy's country or something?

521
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,240
不  他是为了要钱
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

522
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,030
就为这个  这可不是个好办法
I don't buy that. It's not a very good way to make money.

523
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,870
那么...  你知道这人?
So... what is this guy's deal?

524
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,420
前不久他干过类似的事
A while back, he held some people for ransom.

525
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,710
没让他得手  就想报复我
It went sour, and now he's a little pissed at me.

526
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,920
- 跟我们有什么关系?  - 没有  是游戏
- What does that have to do with us? - Nothing. It's a game.

527
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,550
他拿到钱算他赢  汽车炸了也算他赢
If he gets the money, he wins. If the bus blows up, he wins.

528
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,310
- 你赢了呢?  - 过几天再玩一次
- What if you win? - Tomorrow we'll play another one.

529
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,520
我可不会再来开车玩了  没空
But I'm not available to drive tomorrow. Busy.

530
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,070
所有退休的都查了
We got no match for that description.

531
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,820
没一个警察是缺大姆指的
No one's lost a thumb for at least the last 10 years.

532
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,240
- 可能是外地的  - 这就很难查了
- He could be from anywhere. - I can't access all that.

533
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,530
想起来了  查一下领抚恤金的警察档案
Forget the files. Start going through the pension fund.

534
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,450
这家伙是残疾人  退休以后就住在洛杉机
This guy's drawing disability. He may not be LAPD, but he's living here now.

535
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,620
把照片给我  我见过他
I want pictures! I've seen this asshole.

536
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,310
把乘客从车里弄出来
Hey! Let's get these passengers off the bus!

537
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,480
这绝对不行
We can't do it, sir!

538
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,390
没工夫看你表演特技了
There's no time for any stunts.

539
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
得尽快让他们脱离困境
We gotta get these people out of harm's way.

540
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,940
可他不允许  他一直在监视着我们
I got orders. We move these people, he'll see.

541
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,860
你忘了  他是个狡猾的疯子
Remember: crazy, not stupid.

542
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,370
好吧  哈里正在想办法查他  可能是个警察
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is. We think maybe he's a cop.

543
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,120
警长  是他
Lieutenant, it's him.

544
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:15,620
- 他想找杰克  - 是他打来的
- He wants to talk to Jack. - He's on the line for you.

545
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,630
- 把号码告诉他  - 给他号码
- OK, give him the number. - Give him the number.

546
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,720
- 他怎么样?  - 血不太流了  可...
- How's he doing? - The bleeding is less, but...

547
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,430
- 他们会救我们吗?  - 会的  他们是警察
- Are they going to help us? - Sure they are. They're the police.

548
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:33,310
靠我们交的税发薪水  当然不希望我们死
Hey, your taxes are paying their salary. If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

549
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,770
我的意思  是说...
I mean, you know.

550
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,280
是我
Yeah.

551
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,610
我本来很信任你
I think we have trust,

552
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:48,030
可是从电视上看来  好像你打算让乘客离开巴士
but it looks on TV like you're trying to get those passengers off.

553
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,660
- 有一个必须下车  - 可我们有约在先
- Look, you've gotta let me have one. - We went over the rules.

554
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,790
情况紧急
As an act of faith.

555
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,710
客车司机被人开枪打伤了
We have an injured man here. The driver's been shot.

556
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,500
杰克  是不是你又想朝人质开枪了?
Tell me you haven't been shooting the passengers.

557
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:03,300
我想警察一般不朝好人开枪  就该朝那些坏人开枪
I thought it was customary for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

558
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:07,470
- 这个司机伤势很重  - 我不允许下车
- This man has no time. - No one gets off.

559
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,390
你要发点善心  可以早点拿到赎金
It'll grease the wheels with the money men.

560
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,760
再说还剩不少人质
There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.

561
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,980
好吧   孩子  你想法让司机下车
OK, son, you can try and unload the driver.

562
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,400
你告诉那开车的野猫  千万别把车的速度放慢
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel not to slow down, though,

563
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,070
否则不等他出去就会炸死  还有  杰克  你别想溜
or he won't even get a chance to bleed to death. And, Jack, don't slip.

564
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:31,870
- 你说司机可以离开  - 诺沃  再靠近一点
- He's letting us unload the driver. - Norwood! Get us closer!

565
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,540
- 杰克要把司机送到这车上  - 就送他?
- We're gonna get the driver off. - Just him?

566
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,870
- 是的  大个儿  - 奥蒂斯
- For now. Gigantor. - Ortiz.

567
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,960
奥蒂斯  帮一下忙  好的  你把他递给我
Ortiz, we're gonna need your help. I need you to pass him to me.

568
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,420
得小心点别把伤口弄出血了
Keep him straight, or the wound'll tear.

569
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:48,260
- 让我们也过去  - 嘿  女士
- What about the rest of us? - Hey, hey, hey! Lady!

570
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,100
让我们也过去
I can't stay!

571
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,270
- 怎么样?  - 不过挨了一枪
- How are you feeling? - Like I've been shot.

572
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,440
- 保重  山姆  - 再见
- Take care, Sam. - OK, Annie.

573
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,020
一直开
Drive straight!

574
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:09,070
- 安妮  尽量靠近他们  - 好的
- Get as close as you can, OK? - All right.

575
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,700
靠近  再近点  安妮
Closer. A little closer, Annie.

576
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,540
- 安妮  再近点  - 好的
- Annie, a little closer. - OK.

577
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,210
行了吗?
OK, how's this?

578
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,050
对不起  对不起
Sorry. Sorry.

579
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,720
安妮  没关系  你再来试一次
OK, Annie. No problem. Let's try it one more time.

580
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,300
再近点
A little more!

581
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:34,550
好的  好的  就这样  保持距离
OK! OK! Right there! Steady! Hold it steady!

582
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,390
拉住了?  拉住了?
You got him? You got him?

583
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,650
我没事  谢谢
I'm all right. Thanks.

584
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,240
- 上帝  - 太好了
- Oh, my God. - Yes!

585
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,960
他会好起来的
He's gonna be OK.

586
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,090
快  你把手伸给我
Come on! Come on, lady. Give me your hand.

587
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,920
- 我走了  安妮  - 不  海伦
- I have to, Annie. - No, Helen!

588
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,220
- 不  海伦  -  快
- No, Helen, no! - Come on!

589
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,390
海伦  别过去
Helen, no! No!

590
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,470
在未开放的105号公路上
I'm here at the 105 Freeway,

591
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,930
那辆高速行驶的客车由警车护卫着
where the police have successfully led the runaway bus...

592
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,100
不  海伦
No, Helen!

593
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,870
妈的  麦克  赶快把该死的直升飞机调走
Goddamn it, Mac! Get those fucking choppers outta here!

594
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,250
这位勇敢的小姐驾驶着这辆汽车  事态已经越来越难以预料
...was driving the bus. Well, I couldn't tell how old...

595
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:48,210
刚才发生爆炸  但范围不是很大
An explosion. Some kind of an explosion.

596
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,380
呃  汽车没有爆炸  不过...  我的天
The bus hasn't exploded, but... Oh, my God.

597
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:55,890
一个人被炸出车外  还被钩在车底下  真是太可怕了
A woman caught in the blast fell. She was pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.

598
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:00,220
电视的威力  杰克  未来的浪潮  是吧?
Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future, huh?

599
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,160
我不该来的
I can't be here.

600
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,710
不该  真的
I can't, you know...

601
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,840
不该上这车
This is the wrong bus.

602
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,010
我不该
I mean, for me to...

603
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,800
不该这么死
I can't die here.

604
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,010
嗨  你闭嘴
Hey, shut up, man.

605
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,560
- 我还有老婆呢  - 是吗?
- I got a wife. - Oh, you do?

606
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,230
嗨  你有老婆怎么了?  我没结婚  难道我就该死吗?
Hey! So if you have a wife and I don't, does that mean I'm expendable?

607
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,610
你这叫什么话呢?
What are you talking about, man?

608
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,900
这人废话太多
The guy's just talking crazy.

609
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,990
听了都心烦  现在谁心里都烦
He gets on my nerves. He gets on everybody's nerves.

610
01:00:55,070 --> 01:01:00,620
- 我认为我有发牢骚的权利  - 你到别的地方去发
- I think I have the right to be a little upset. - What are you staring at, anyway?

611
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,580
你让我们安静点行不行  呃?
Why don't you let us all die in peace, if it has to happen?

612
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:08,540
就凭你个儿大想欺负人  是不是?
Oh, so you're a really tough guy, huh? Why don't we just step outside?

613
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,710
嘿
Hey!

614
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,230
嗨  你觉得还好吧?
How are you doing? You all right?

615
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,230
别太难过
What can I do?

616
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,530
听了爆炸...
When that bomb went off...

617
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,320
我理解
I know.

618
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,280
我想炸弹  炸弹爆炸了  我死定了
I thought that was it. I thought that was the bomb, and I was dead.

619
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:44,580
后来看见只有她躺在地上  我就松了一口气...
And then when I saw her body fall under the bus, it was like...

620
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,290
庆幸自己没死
You were glad you were still alive.

621
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,130
- 我太自私了  - 别这么想
- I'm so sorry. - Don't be.

622
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,760
我们都应该庆幸
You should be glad. We all are.

623
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,930
- 这不等于自私  - 那会儿我看见她那么害怕
- It doesn't mean you don't care. - I know, but she was so scared.

624
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:04,220
她是个好人  不应该死的
She was a nice lady who didn't deserve to get killed,

625
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:07,390
可安妮  那家伙杀人不眨眼
but if she'd gotten off, it would have killed us all.

626
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,940
他是个恶棍  安妮  会有报应的  记住这个  呃?
He's the asshole, Annie. The guy who put us here. Remember that, OK?

627
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,570
是恶魔
Big asshole.

628
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,780
好的
OK.

629
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,030
肯定吗?
Are you sure?

630
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,200
有多宽?
Well, how far?

631
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,290
警长  呃  有个严重的情况
Sir, we have a serious problem.

632
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:31,830
什么?
What?

633
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,000
- 这条公路还没竣工  - 什么? 你说什么?
- This freeway isn't finished. - What are you talking about?

634
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:40,800
空中巡逻队发现  前面三英里左右的地方有断切面
The aerial unit caught it. About three miles ahead there's a section missing.

635
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,640
断切面?
A section missing?

636
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,560
可这地图上并没注明有什么断切面
But it's on the map. It's finished on the goddamn map!

637
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,730
可能没有按时完工
I guess they fell behind.

638
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,820
妈的  混蛋  都是一帮混蛋
Fuck! You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!

639
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,450
靠过来一点
Get me closer!

640
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,410
嘿  靠近点  从镜子里看
Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror.

641
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,250
杰克
Jack!

642
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,170
- 断面有多宽?  - 至少有... 五十英尺
- How big is the section? - 50 feet... at least.

643
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,680
前头路面有个豁口  很宽
There's a gap in the road up ahead. It's big.

644
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:28,220
- 开玩笑  多宽?  - 五十英尺
- You're kidding. How big? - 50 feet.

645
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,770
什么?
What?

646
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,270
看来只能把乘客弄下车
We gotta get these people off the bus somehow.

647
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,980
这行不通
You know I can't.

648
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,020
他说什么?
What did he say? Jack?

649
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,780
他说什么?
Jack, what did he say?

650
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,820
什么事?  怎么了?
What's the matter?

651
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,790
- 前面有个大豁口  - 什么?
- There's a gap in the freeway. - What?

652
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,630
- 怎么回事?  - 多大的口子?
- What do you mean? - How big is a gap?

653
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,840
五十英尺
50 feet. A couple of miles ahead.

654
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,050
真要人命了
This is crazy.

655
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,930
- 天呐  - 杰克
- Jeez. - Jack.

656
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:13,810
拉到空挡让马达空转行不行?
Jack. What if I shift into neutral and just keep the engine revving?

657
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:17,560
- 不  行不通  - 怎么办? 说呀  说呀
- No, he'd have thought of that. - What, then? What? What?

658
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,940
妈的  说呀  杰克
What? Jack?

659
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,570
- 加速  - 什么?
- Floor it. - What?

660
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,990
那是交叉口  可能有坡度  加速
Floor it. It's an interchange. There might be an incline.

661
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,820
好吧
Fine.

662
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:34,330
请大家坐稳  抓住前面的靠背拉手
Everybody hold onto your seats or whatever you can.

663
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,500
到了豁口  低下头
When we hit the gap, heads down.

664
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,920
就这样?  就这样?
That's it? That's it?

665
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,130
只能这样了  把这些放到座位底下
That's all we can do. Let's put these underneath your seat, all right?

666
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,760
把包都放到座位底下
Put your bags underneath the seat.

667
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:55,850
- 我不是有意开枪的  - 坐稳了
- Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy. - Hold on.

668
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,860
你能有把握吗?
Is this really gonna work?

669
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,270
杰克
Jack.

670
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,610
来了
Yeah?

671
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,990
杰克
Jack.

672
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,680
- 加速  加速  加速  - 上帝
- Come on, come on, come one. - Oh, God.

673
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:34,060
- 加速  -  天呐
- Come on! - Oh, God.

674
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,530
真要命
Oh, shit.

675
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,710
大家坐稳了
Everybody hold on!

676
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,020
上帝  杰克
Oh, God. Jack.

677
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,360
天呐
Shit!

678
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,220
不可思议
Yes! We are way out of control!

679
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,980
- 没事吧?  - 没事
- You OK? - Yeah.

680
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,650
- 还好吗?  - 我很好
- You OK? - I'm OK.

681
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,980
好的  诺沃  我们走
All right! Norwood, let's go!

682
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,950
- 大家没事吧  - 没事  哈
- Is everybody OK? - Yes!

683
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,120
成功了
We did it!

684
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,410
成功了
We made it.

685
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,160
你真是好样儿的
You're the man. You are the man!

686
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,920
谢谢  谢谢大家
Thank you. Thank you very much.

687
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,460
天呐
Oh, shit.

688
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,420
- 你真是个天才  - 什么天才?
- I think you missed your calling. - Yeah? What was it?

689
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,430
小心点  你该当飞行员
Watch the road. You should have been a pilot.

690
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:43,560
- 下去  - 什么?
- Get off. - What?

691
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:46,610
从这儿开出去  快点
Get off this. Now. Get off this.

692
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,650
[ 洛 杉 矶 机 场 入 口 ]

693
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,610
往这儿
In there.

694
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,620
- 什么?  这儿?  - 对
- Where? Right here? - Yeah.

695
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,120
- 是这儿吗?  - 没错
- Right here? - Yeah.

696
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,760
- 他开进机场了  - 飞机场?  那儿的人可不少
- He's just entered the airport. - There's thousands of people there.

697
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,180
好样的  杰克  在里面兜圈  这主意不错
That's my boy Jack. He can circle the runways and buy us some time.

698
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:25,100
- 电视台的直升飞机进不去  - 他往停机坪去了
- Choppers can't fly there. It's restricted. - He's headed for the end of the field.

699
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:29,520
- 停机坪那头有一条应急跑道  - 但愿修好了  我们走
- Bravo Tango, an emergency runway. - Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

700
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:45,330
这儿是机场
We're at the airport.

701
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,500
是啊  怎么?
Yeah? So?

702
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,670
我看着像机场
I already seen the airport.

703
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:15,450
- 喂  - 非常  非常  激动人心
- Yeah? - Very, very exciting, Jack.

704
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:19,780
杰克  差点没命  呃?  可是你表现得非常出色
Some close calls, huh? But you've done all right for yourself.

705
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:23,080
- 什么事?  - 我要那笔钱
- What do you want? - I want money, Jack.

706
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:29,330
也许  呃  我有比这更崇高的目标  不过恐怕到头来只能为了钱
I wish I had some loftier purpose, but I'm afraid in the end it's just the money, Jack.

707
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:36,050
你叫他们把不连号码的纸币  装在两只塑料口袋里  别作记号
I would like large non-sequential bills in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

708
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:40,470
- 听明白了吗?  - 你干嘛跟我说?
- Can you remember all that? - What are you telling me for?

709
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,810
我要你帮我拿到那笔钱  避免悲剧
Because I want you to help me to get it before it gets too late.

710
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,770
我不喜欢谈判  杰克  那些人嘴上说得好听
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you like they're your best friend

711
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,940
背地里总想着办法来治你
and they don't even know you.

712
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,440
你说他们干嘛要耍我  呃?  他们当我拿人命开玩笑?
Why are they messing with me, huh? Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

713
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:57,950
- 你不是吗?  - 别这样  杰克
- Aren't you? - Oh, that's unfair, Jack.

714
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:02,450
你根本不知道我的感受  你不了解我
You don't know how I feel about this. You don't even know me.

715
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,950
你想发财可不想付代价
You want a shitload of money you didn't earn.

716
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,580
我付了
Oh, I earned it.

717
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,580
我付了我一生作代价
I spent my life earning it.

718
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:15,340
我也得过奖  可是得奖的同时  也得到了一份解雇通知单
I got a medal, too, Jack, a medal and a pink slip and a "sorry about your hand".

719
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,590
- 你得让我出去  - 不
- You have to let me off. - Oh, no.

720
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,550
- 这可办不到  - 你要我帮你?
- That's not good. - You want me to help you?

721
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,350
我就得找他们当面谈  因为他们不相信你
I need to talk to these people face to face. They think you're bullshit.

722
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,520
那就让他们等着瞧
They don't think that.

723
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,060
你要钱  我要保护这些人的性命
Look, you want the money, I don't want anyone else to die.

724
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:32,310
你放我出去
Let me get on the ground.

725
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,480
就放我  这不违反规则
Just me. That's not against the rules.

726
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,650
好吧  可是不能耽搁太久
All right. I want you back real fast.

727
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,400
行
Fine.

728
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:44,160
杰克  不许耍花招  我比你高明得多
Jack, nothing tricky now. You know that I'm on top of you.

729
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:47,290
你无论如何也斗不过我
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

730
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:00,300
- 你跟他谈妥了吗?  - 妥了
- So I guess there's a plan now? - Could be.

731
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,550
- 怎么?  - 他放我下车
- Yeah? - He's letting me off.

732
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,890
- 什么?  - 你还接着开  没事
- What? - Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

733
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,440
- 大家多保重  我去去就来  - 那你还会回来吗?
- Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute. - Do you think that's a good idea?

734
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,230
- 我会回来的  - 你不管我们了吗?
- It'll be OK. - Are you just gonna leave us here?

735
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,610
- 还用问?  - 放心  我就回来
- I would. - Don't worry. I won't go far.

736
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,240
嗨  别忘了我们
Hey. Don't forget about us.

737
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:39,130
电视台的飞机走了  可以救人了
The choppers are gone. Let's dump the passengers.

738
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,630
- 不行  他会知道  - 他打哪儿知道?
- He's ready for that. - How is that possible?

739
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,890
我也不清楚  可我能肯定  每次他总能抢先一步
I don't know how. I just know he is. He's been a step ahead every time.

740
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:49,220
- 他会先动手引爆炸弹的  - 你说该怎么办?
- If we unload, he'll take them out. - So where does that put us?

741
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,600
试试看  把炸弹拆除
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

742
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,560
这辆公交车经历了十号公路
After an incredible ride on the 10 freeway,

743
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,230
和一零五公路的险情之后
the streets of Los Angeles and the 105 freeway,

744
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,950
接着开进了洛杉矶的国际机场  绕着一条应急跑道继续行驶
this bus has ended up here at Los Angeles International Airport, circling the runway.

745
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,380
我说  安妮  他准不会回来了
I'm telling you, he's somewhere jerking off.

746
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,260
别忘了当时他是主动要上车的
He didn't have to get on the bus in the first place, Ortiz.

747
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,590
嗨  别过这根黄线
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

748
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,550
他干嘛?
What is that?

749
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,940
这我也不知道
I have no idea.

750
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,780
这根绳支持不了几分钟
We won't be able to hold this steady for long.

751
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,360
我也只能有几分钟时间  试试看也许来得及
I just need a few minutes. If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all.

752
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,820
- 哈里  帮我  - 好  当心点  杰克
- Harry, you with me? - Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

753
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:57,250
他干嘛?  上帝  他真疯了
What's he doing? Oh, my God. He is insane.

754
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:07,130
好了  杰克  开始吧  别丢了命
OK, Jack, this is it. Don't get dead.

755
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,110
- 这不是好主意  - 他准能行
- This is not a very good plan. - Have faith, sister.

756
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,190
老天爷
Oh, Christ.

757
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,830
你得把车开稳一点
Just keep it steady.

758
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,460
谢谢提醒  奥蒂斯
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

759
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:54,140
他简直疯了
This guy is nuts!

760
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:58,440
那个装置上有电池  你暂时别去碰它
We'll try to bypass the remote current with the battery.

761
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,190
- 你有没有看见引爆线?  - 不知道  这儿有几根电线
- Can you find the tripwire for the remote? - I don't know. I got a few choices here.

762
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,030
- 黑和红?  - 还有绿
- Black and red? - And green.

763
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,490
恐怕他不会用铜丝做引爆线
OK, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go with standard copper for the remote.

764
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,990
电流量太小  他会用合金纤维
That'd be too weak. I'd use a fibre alloy.

765
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,200
杰克  找找那根合金电线
Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire.

766
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:19,790
都给包住了
Harry, it's covered.

767
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,710
知道  你把外包皮切开  不能切断那电线
I know. You're gonna have to cut off the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

768
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,670
好
Right.

769
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,730
妈的
Fuck me!

770
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:42,860
妈的
Shit!

771
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,320
- 找到了  - 太棒了
- Bull's-eye! - Great.

772
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,990
你先把电池夹住然后绕过引爆器
OK. I want you to clip on the battery and then run it to the lead wire.

773
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
明白
Copy.

774
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,350
绕不过去  会引爆的
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

775
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,890
妈的  他有防备了
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

776
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:23,980

01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,440
被炸断了一根姆指  受伤后不久退休
when a small charge left him with fingers numbering nine.

778
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:30,950
就这狗娘养的  找着他了  杰克
That's our scumbag! We got him. Jack, we found him.

779
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,490
他住处离这儿不远
We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.

780
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,820
好  杰克  你不用拆了
Jack, get out of there.

781
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,580
- 我们这就去捣他的老窝  - 你要小心
- We're going after the source. - Watch your back.

782
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,620
等等  等等我
Wait for me!

783
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:43,790
麦克  拉我出去
Mac, get me outta here.

784
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:00,020
谁去后面看看他出来没有  快
Somebody go to the back and check and see if he came out the back. Go!

785
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:13,900
- 看见他了吗?  - 后面看不见他
- Can you see him? - He's not behind us.

786
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,120
- 什么?  - 没看见他人
- What? - He's not back here.

787
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,620
上帝  上帝  再去看看
Oh, my God. Go look!

788
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:22,120
再看看车底下  看看他是不是在车底下
Lay down and look under the bus and see if you can see him down there.

789
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,870
- 看见了吗?  - 没有
- Can you see him? - No.

790
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,920
你再仔细看看  车胎后面有没有?
You don't see him back by the tyre or something?

791
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,210
- 也没有  - 肯定吗?
- I can't see him. - Are you sure?

没看见他
I can't see him.

793
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:57,870
撞着他了  上帝  看见他了吗?
Oh, my God! We hit him! Oh, my God! Do you see him?

794
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,870
- 撞着他了?  - 到两边窗口看看他在不在
- Did we hit him? - Look out the sides.

795
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:11,380
- 工具  - 快点给他工具
- My tools! - Will somebody get him his tools?

796
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,850
动作快一点
Please help him! Hurry!

797
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,360
他准在车底下  看见了吗?
God, we're dragging him. Do you see him?

- 看见他了  - 什么?
- I see him! - What?

801
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,530
- 看见他了  - 他没事吧?
- I see him! - You do? Is he OK?

802
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,250
他没事  他没事
He's all right! He's all right!

803
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:49,710
拉住我  拉住我  快拉住我的腿
Hold my legs. Hold my legs. Somebody hold my legs.

804
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,880
拉住他  拉住他

805
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,460
- 拉住腿  - 加油

01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,230
上来了  来  上来
We got him now. Come on, pull!

810
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,320
真是个奇迹
Jesus. I can't believe it.

811
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,570
你真是一个疯子  杰克  知道吗?  谢天谢地
You are a complete jerk. You know that?

812
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:26,080
- 你去拆炸弹了?  - 是的  差点爆炸
- Did you have any luck with the bomb? - Yeah. It didn't go off.

813
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,830
奥蒂斯  谢谢
Ortiz, thanks.

814
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,000
你的命真大  伙计
How many lives you got, man?

815
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:38,090
你可真是条好汉  凭这股劲你可以多找几个姑娘
You're not too bright, man, but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.

816
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,260
你是叫...  叫什么  奥蒂斯
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

817
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,140
我是想夸夸你
Can't even pay him a compliment.

818
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,440
- 怎么样?  - 你吓死了我  杰克
- How you doing? - You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

819
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,770
不过我没事
Other than that, I'm fine.

820
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:57,440
- 什么味儿?  - 汽油
- What is that smell? - It's gas.

821
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,030
- 这车漏油了?  - 怪哉
- We're leaking gas? - We are now.

822
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:07,200
你是不是想再历一次险?
You felt you needed another challenge or something?

823
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:10,210
- 麦克  - 杰克  什么事?
- Mac. - Mac here. Go ahead.

824
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:13,000
你能不能找辆油车  这车漏油了
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us? We're losing gas.

825
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:18,630
- 这就去找  能坚持多久?  - 十分钟左右吧  情况不妙
- I'll see what I can find. How much time? -10 minutes? It doesn't look good.

826
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,800
好吧  诺沃  你现在赶紧去找一辆油车
Gotcha. Norwood, get a fuel car out here on the double.

827
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,680
能坚持吗?
Is that gonna work?

828
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,140
不知道
I don't know.

829
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:32,810
快呀  快救救我
Harry, save my life.

830
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,820
哈里  你有什么好消息?
Harry, tell me good news, man.

831
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,660
抱歉  杰克  他失败了
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

832
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,790
混蛋
You fuck!

833
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:21,840
是那块手表把他引到我家去的  呃?
It was the watch that led him to me, wasn't it? Huh?

834
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,130
用我那珍贵的退休礼物制作炸弹
It seemed a little hammy to me to build

835
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,470
是不是太富有戏剧性了?
the bomb out of my precious retirement gift,

836
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:32,260
可这实际上是在暗示他  "霍沃派恩在等着他"
but, you know, I figured a sign that said "Howard Payne" would be pushing it.

837
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,640
我向上帝发誓  非把你撕成碎片不可
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine out, I swear to God.

838
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,690
可你还是得照我说的去做
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

839
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:44,820
杰克  我知道哈里生前是你的搭档  是你的智囊
Jack, we both know that he was the brains of your particular operation.

840
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,820
你们斗不过我  就得给我那笔线
You can't beat me. You're gonna pay me every dollar.

841
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:52,620
要不然  你和那个野猫  还有车上那些个无辜的乘客
Otherwise, you, the wildcat and every innocent person on that bus

842
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,620
会跟你朋友同样下场
are gonna end up just like your friend.

843
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:00,500
听清楚了吗?  听见我说的了?
Are you paying attention? Jack, are you listening to me?

844
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,920
- 杰克  杰克  - 在
- Jack? Jack? - Yeah.

845
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:09,970
很好  靠百胜广场的东北角
Good. You tell them that the drop point is Pershing Square.

846
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:14,430
有一个垃圾桶
There's a garbage can on the northeast corner.

847
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,060
叫他们把钱扔在那桶里
You drop the bags and leave.

848
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,060
我等他们离开以后  会去把那钱袋取出来的
I don't show until all your people are gone.

849
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:27,490
已经快到十一点了  我预感到今天会是个最最愉快的日子
It's getting on to 11 am, Jack, and I think it's gonna be a very pretty day.

850
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:39,870
杰克
Jack.

851
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:46,590
好了  杰克  别这样  杰克  你别泄气
Come on. Don't give up on me, Jack! Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

852
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,930
别这样  好吗?  你千万不能泄气
Stop it, OK? Don't give up on me right now, all right?

853
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:57,890
我心里真害怕  大家都需要你  我一个人对付不了这局面
We're really scared and we need you right now. I can't do this by myself. Please?

854
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,310
杰克  求你了
Jack, please.

855
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,530
好吗?  求你了  好吗?
OK? Please. All right?

856
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:17,080
- 我们会死的  - 不会的  你别泄气  好吗?
- We're gonna die. - No, we're not. We got this far, OK?

857
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,560
真该死
I'll be damned.

858
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,780
你上过阿历桑那州立大学?
Did you go to the University ofArizona?

859
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,240
- 是啊  怎么了?  - 球队很棒
- Yeah? So? - Good football team.

860
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,990
也许吧  谁知道呢
Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know.

861
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,910
阿历桑那野猫球队
Arizona Wildcats.

862
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,500
- 怎么?  - 他看得见
- Right. - He can see you.

863
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,540
- 什么?  - 他看得见你
- What? - He can see you.

864
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:07,540
你只管朝前面看
Just keep looking straight ahead.

865
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:28,110
他一直称你"野猫"  这杂种在你头顶上安了摄像机
He called you a wildcat before. Bastard's got a camera right in your face.

866
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:31,400
我当傻子当到现在
He can see the whole bus. He's been playing me from minute one.

867
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:35,860
- 那么  他看得见也听得见?  - 听不见  只看得见
- Well, he can see me, but can he hear me? - Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.

868
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,290
据本台记者报道  这辆高速行驶的公交汽车
We are following the progress of what is turning out to be a harrowing story,

869
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:44,410
车上装有炸弹   一旦减速会引起爆炸
as a city bus, rigged to explode if it slows down,

870
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,750
它一直在沿着飞机场的跑道兜圈子
races around literally in circles at the Los Angeles airport.

871
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,050
有一名女乘客和另一辆巴士的司机
The dead are a female passenger and a driver of another bus,

872
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,710
都已被车上的炸弹炸死
both blown up by the bomber.

873
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,760
这个恐怖事件的发生
Others in jeopardy are the passengers of the bus,

874
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,800
据说是出于一个疯子的变态心理
held hostage at the whim of a madman.

875
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,890
我有变态心理
"The whim of a madman. "

876
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,980
说得好
I like that.

877
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:08,980
在我的左肩上方有一台摄像机
There's a camera on the bus just over my left shoulder.

878
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,070
现在要求大家朝前看
I want you to stare straight ahead.

879
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,700
坐在位置上不要动  好吗?
Don't make any big movements, OK?

880
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,070
我是杰克
It's Jack.

881
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,240
是的  我知道了
Yeah, I know about Harry.

882
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,710
电视台的车在吗?
Is that news van still around?

883
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:29,040
- 叫记者暂停播放  - 好的
- Get those cameras to stop taping. - Right.

884
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:33,420
我是警察  借一下机器   能播放超高频吗?
LAPD. I need this unit. You can broadcast UHF, right?

885
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:36,300
请帮我找出那车上的频道
There's a signal going to that bus. I want you to find it.

886
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,970
请大家现在暂时停一下
We're gonna have to take you off the air.

887
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:42,310
有紧急情况  只好请大家暂时停下
Please, sir, stop taping.

888
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:45,680
快点  快点  好  录下来
Come on, hurry up. Good! Tape off of that.

889
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:52,820
别做大动作  显得累点
Remember, no big movements. Just look whipped.

890
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,610
这个倒不难做到
That ain't gonna be too hard.

891
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,920
- 录下来  快  录下来  - 我录了
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it. - It's taping!

892
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:21,760
- 杰克  - 啊
- Jack. - Yeah?

893
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,930
看
Look.

894
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,560
- 麦克  汽油  - 杰克  等五分钟
- Mac, fuel. - Jack, five minutes.

895
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,650
没时间了  放录像  转移人吧
Not enough time. Run the tape. We have to unload.

896
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,400
- 可我才录了一分钟  - 快放
- I only have a minute of tape. - Do it now.

897
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:40,320
把刚才录好的  做一盘循环带反覆播放
I want you to make a tape and loop it so that it runs over and over, OK?

898
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:47,950
- 好了  放  快放  - 好吧  开始播放了
- All right, run it. Run it! - All right. Tape's rolling.

899
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:53,630
还没收到新的实况录像  据记者报道  汽车仍在继续沿机场跑道兜圈子
We still have no live picture, but reports are that the bus continues to circle...

900
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:58,470
车上乘客暂时没有新的伤亡
Everyone is safe for the moment.

901
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:02,300
此时此刻  这些乘客在想些什么
Hard to imagine what's going through their thoughts at this time.

902
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:04,680
不过可以肯定他们每一个人...
Certainly, a sense of community...

903
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:26,160
稳住方向盘  踩住油门
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

904
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,290
好了  开始吧  一个个过
All right, let's get 'em off.

905
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:33,460
好  你  你  你
OK, you, you, and you.

906
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,050
警方发布了一个情况报告
Police have just issued a general statement,

907
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:39,800
内容跟以前差不多
which doesn't tell us much more...

908
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:43,300
抓住手  对了  好
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

909
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,890
过来  别往下看
Come on. Look straight ahead.

910
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:08,370
-  很好  - 抓住我的手腕
- That's good, that's good. - Grab my wrist.

伸出手  抓住他的手
Put your hand out. Take his hand.

912
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,220
过来  伙计  别害怕
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

913
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,180
把手给我  快点

914
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,770
抓住我  别低头
Grab my hand. Don't look down.

915
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,560
妈的
Shit!

916
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,230
杰克
Jack!

917
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:45,200
抓紧我
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

918
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,420
杰克  我稳不住它了
Jack! Jack, I can't hold this any more.

919
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,830
安妮
Annie!

920
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,250
安妮  坚持住
You... hold on!

921
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,220
不  不  不
No! No! No!

922
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,640
坚持住
Hold it.

923
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:19,400
- 上帝  - 用这抵住油门
- Oh, God. - Wedge down the gas pedal.

924
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,990
好  好  抵住了
OK, I got it.

925
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,250
- 系好了?  - 对  系好了
- You got it? - Yeah. I got it.

926
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,100
- 安妮  下去  - 我不行  杰克  我不行
- OK, Annie, get on. - Jack, I can't do this.

927
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,600
- 快点  快点  - 妈的  妈的
- Let's go! Let's go! - Shit. Shit.

928
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,140
- 呃  杰克  - 妈的  快点
- Jack. - Shit!

929
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,310
好  好
Hold on.

930
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,360
妈的
Shit!

931
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:37,790
你好吗?
Are you all right?

932
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:40,040
还行
No.

933
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:44,540
没事  都过去了
It's OK. It's OK. It's over.

934
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:49,210
安妮  你成功了
It's over. You did it. You did it.

935
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,640
再也不来机场了
I hate the airport.

936
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,730
你会对我有感情吗?
You're not gonna get mushy on me, are you?

937
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,190
也许  没准
Maybe. I might.

938
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:16,320
在紧张的情况下产生的感情不会牢靠
I hope not, cos relationships that start under intense circumstances never last.

939
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:19,080
- 是吗?  - 我研究过这个问题
- Oh, yeah? - I've done extensive studying on this.

940
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,620
救兵来了
Here comes the cavalry.

941
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,270
- 怎么样  - 没事
- How ya doing? - We're OK.

942
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:46,900
我做一次好人  放你半天假
I just might be a nice guy and let you have the rest of the day off.

943
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,060
太好了
Oh, boy.

944
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:51,860
麦克  这是安妮
Mac, this is Annie.

945
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:55,110
安妮  这是麦克蒙警长
Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon.

946
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
- 你好  - 你好
- How you doing? - OK.

947
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,660
这伤口得消消毒
This should take care of it.

948
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:03,120
- 哟  轻点  - 对不起
- Watch it. - Sorry.

949
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,460
- 送你们去医院治一下  - 警长
- We're gonna have you guys checked out. - Lieutenant!

950
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,880
是他  问我们几时把钱送去
It's him. He wants to know when he's gonna get his money.

951
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,920
狗娘养的  现在只有上帝能帮助我们了
I'll tell him what to do with his goddamn money.

952
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:17,510
嗨  他并不知道我们已经离开巴士了
He doesn't know it blew up.

953
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,220
30分钟后行动
30 minutes.

954
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:04,520
呆在这里  千万别离开
I'll be right back.

955
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:13,270
好  现在开始行动  你  你  去一号位置
All right, here's our target. Fox, I want you in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3. Let's move it.

956
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,690
- 其他人跟我走  打开跟踪器了吗?  - 已经打开了  长官
- Is the paint bomb in with the money? - It's done, sir.

957
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,840
杰克  你成不了好警察
Too bad, Jack. You could've made a good cop.

958
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:23,890
好
OK.

959
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:32,770
还没收到新的实况录像  据记者报道  汽车仍在继续沿机场跑道兜圈子
We still have no live picture. Reports are that the bus continues to circle inside LAX.

960
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:42,780
不  不
No! No!

961
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:10,180
小姐  你不能待在这里  不安全
Miss, you can't be this close. You need to move back.

962
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:11,770
不  杰克·特莱文说...
No. Jack Traven said...

963
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:16,310
杰克·特来文警官要我带你去一个安全的场所  快跟我走吧
Jack Traven asked that you be brought out of harm's way. Just move right over here.

964
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:20,320
- 看来他迟到了  - 不可能
- He's running a little late. - He's not late.

965
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:24,660
- 什么?  - 他不会迟到
- What? - He's never late.

966
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:27,240
可那钱还在那儿
Well, that money hasn't moved.

967
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:32,330
上百双眼睛盯那只桶  钱里还有跟踪器  他插翅难逃
We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog in the bag. I'd say he's covered.

968
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,250
- 打开  - 为什么?  他还没...
- Turn it on. - What for? It hasn't moved.

969
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:41,420
打开
Just do it.

970
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:51,770
妈的  在动  钱拿走了
Shit. It's moving. He's got the money.

971
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:53,140
杰克
Jack!

972
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:04,360
妈的
Shit!

973
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,550
不许动
Freeze!

974
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:27,800
临时测验  混蛋  枪口对着你的脑门
Pop quiz, asshole. You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

975
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:31,720
你怎么办?  你怎么办?
What do you do? What do you do?

976
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,940
转过来  转过来
Turn around. Turn around!

977
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,920
- 不  - 对不起
- Oh, no. - I'm sorry.

978
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:03,130
准备测验
Be prepared.

979
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,970
童子军面临人生的考验
It's the Boy Scout marching song.

980
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:10,430
你怎么办  杰克?  我想你不会朝她开枪吧?
What are you gonna do, Jack? I don't think you can shoot her.

981
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:11,760
放她走
Let her go.

982
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:15,850
不  这恐怕办不到
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

983
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:18,600
装上  快
Fill it. Now.

984
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,070
哈里要是知道又重头开始了
I think Harry would be very disappointed,

985
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,900
恐怕会感到非常失望的  呃?
feeling that we're right back where we started.

986
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:31,700
放她走  干嘛还绑她?  你拿着钱走吧  走吧
Let her go. You don't need her. You have the money. Take it and walk.

987
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:35,290
你拿着钱快走吧  你不需要她
Come on. Just take it and walk. You don't need her.

988
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:38,660
- 拿着你的臭钱赶紧走开  - 别过来  你别过来
- Just take your goddamn money and walk! - Stay right there.

989
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:41,920
我会引爆的  我会的
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

990
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,290
是啊
Oh, yeah.

991
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:48,670
我看你至今还没明白过来  呃?
You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh? The beauty of it.

992
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:54,600
造炸弹是为了让它爆炸  这是它的意义和作用
A bomb is made to explode. That's its meaning, its purpose.

993
01:38:54,680 --> 01:39:00,390
你在瞎忙乎因为你想不让它爆炸  不让它发挥它的威力
Your life is empty because you spend it trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

994
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:03,310
你图的是什么?
And for who? For what?

995
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:08,240
要知道  不炸的炸弹算什么玩意儿?
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack, that doesn't explode?

996
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,740
不过是一堆廉价的镀金手表  伙计
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

997
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:17,250
你是疯子  是该死的疯子
You're crazy. You're fucking crazy.

998
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:20,500
不  穷人才是疯子  杰克
No. Poor people are crazy, Jack.

999
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,290
我只是癖好  拿着钱
I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go.

1000
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:26,000
走吧  走啊  快走啊
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

1001
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:28,380
你呆着  快走啊  快走啊
You stay! Move it! Move it!

1002
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:31,010
快进去  快进去  快
In the door. In that door! Now!

1003
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:35,850
再见  杰克  蠢货
Bye, Jack. Punk.

1004
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,190
闪开
All right!

1005
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:45,860
上车  快上车
Get in there. Go on, get in.

1006
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:50,360
你给我进去  马上开车  快
You get back in there! You get this train moving! Go on!

1007
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,910
你们占着座?
Are these seats taken?

1008
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,370
不  走
No. Go.

1009
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:01,910
快  给我过来  把手伸过来
Come on. Back over here. Hands around the pole.

1010
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:23,940
开呀
Damn.

1011
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,500
开呀  开呀
Come on, come on, come on!

1012
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,630
往西方向的五零一次  现在在哪儿?
Please report, Westbound 501. What is your position?

1013

Westbound 501, please check in.

1014
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:09,520
五零一次  我们接到警方命令  你马上开回站  听见了吗?  请回话
Westbound 501. We have police orders to return to the station. Do you copy?

1015
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:14,400
你拿着  捏着这个把  帮个忙
You have to hold this. It's like a grenade. You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

1016
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:18,070
好  捏好了  别松手  呃?  靠你了
Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you.

1017
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,580
听见了吗?  请回话
Do you copy?

1018
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:22,120
嘿  我来接替你
Hey! I'll take it from here.

1019
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,130
看来还得让我来拿着
Maybe you'd better let me have this after all.

1020
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:38,510
我看你实在太紧张了
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical.

1021
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:41,140
会提早把这玩意儿引爆了
and you might let this go a mite early.

1022
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:47,310
嘿  嘿  听我说
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

1023
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,810
过会儿你再帮我拿  好吗?
It's not cos you're a woman, all right?

1024
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:54,240
嘿  没事  你得跟我配合
Hey, it's all right. Looks like we're all alone.

1025
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,740
你赢了  赢了杰克  赢了大家
You won. You beat Jack. You beat everybody.

1026
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:59,490
把我扔出去吧  我不在乎
Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

1027
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:03,240
这个  呃  是个遥控器
This stick works on a remote.

1028
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:07,580
等你一爆炸  他们会过来  可不会找到我
When you explode, that's where they'll come, but it's not where I'll be.

1029
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:12,840
我另有个计划  你粉身碎骨  他们一下会认不出
I have a different plan. Mess like that, they don't even count body parts.

1030
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,710
你再忍一下
Gives me more time.

1031
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:19,510
那样死没有痛苦  安妮
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1032
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,900
嘿  杰克  是你吗?
Hey, Jack, is that you?

1033
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:40,490
这小子可真有股子韧劲
He's so persistent. He always gets his man.

1034
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:44,370
我给你钱  你别再缠着我了  好吗?
Wouldn't be able to interest you in a bribe, would I?

1035
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:48,040
我有好多好多的钱
I've got plenty to go around.

1036
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,880
我的钱
My money!

1037
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:02,550
你这狗杂种  我叫你耍我
You bastard! How does that feel?

1038
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:07,980
叫你耍我  狗杂种
You like that, huh? You like it, you bastard?

1039
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:14,150
我的钱
My money!

1040
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,570
妈的
Shit!

1041
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:26,120
你  我饶不了你  杰克
You! I'm coming for you, Jack!

1042
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:58,980
嘿  遥控器在这儿  想要吗?
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy. You want that?

1043
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,990
呃  我饶不了你
I'm gonna get you.

1044
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:04,660
太爽了
Oh, yes!

1045
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:21,920
还有招吗  杰克  呃?  你自以为很聪明  是吗?
What do you do, Jack? What do you do? You're so smart, right, Jack?

1046
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:27,300
小杂种  你斗不过我  因为我比你高明
You piece of shit! I'm the guy with the plan cos I'm smarter than you.

1047
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:29,470
比你高出一百倍
I'm smarter than you.

1048
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:44,860
是啊
Yeah.

1049
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,080
可我比你高
But I'm taller.

1050
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:51,080
杰克  杰克
Jack.

1051
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
快来救我
Jack!

1052
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,830
天呐  我以为你死了  杰克
Oh, God! I thought you were dead. Jack.

1053
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:01,420
- 转过去  - 他呢?
- Turn around. - Where's Payne?

1054
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:03,170
脑袋掉了
He lost his head.

1055
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:07,890
天呐
Oh, God.

1056
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:11,930
- 把这卸了  好吗?  - 好  把它卸了
- Let's take this off, shall we? - Yes. Let's take this off.

1057
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:17,770
- 卸了它  - 喂  喂
- Take it off. - Hello? Hello?

1058
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:22,690
请回话  杰克  我是麦克  听见了吗?
Does anyone copy? Jack, this is Mac. Can you hear me?

1059
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:29,410
杰克  你在吗?  快把车停下  那轨道没完工
Jack, if you're there, you've got to stop the train. The track isn't finished.

1060
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:30,700
麦克  知道了
Mac, I copy.

1061
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:35,330
- 麦克  - 谁能听到吗?
- Mac. - If someone can hear me...

1062
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:40,710
- 麦克  听见了吗?  - 拉紧急刹车  杰克  请回话
- Mac, can you hear me? - Try the emergency brake. Do you copy?

1063
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,220
全坏了  安妮  这下糟糕了
Nothing works! Annie, you won't believe this.

1064
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:47,720
什么?
What?

1065
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,550
我们得跳车
We have to jump.

1066
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,720
刹不住
You can't stop it?

1067
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:59,440
那么  把我手铐打开
Well, OK, undo me, and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

1068
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:03,690
- 我没钥匙  - 什么?
- I don't have a key. - What?

1069
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,820
我没钥匙
I don't have the key.

1070
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,800
妈的
Shit.

1071
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:48,200
你快跳车  你快离开这辆列车
You gotta get off... You gotta get off the train.

1072
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:52,660
杰克  快走  这个轨道是死的
Jack, please! This track dead-ends. You gotta get off this train. This is crazy.

1073
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,950
有个拐口
There's a curve ahead.

1074
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:58,620
我把速度加大  让车冲出去
I'm gonna speed it up, make it jump the track.

1075
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:02,330
你别犯傻了  你跳车吧
This is really stupid. Jack, please. You can still jump.

1076
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,800
杰克  杰克  求你
Jack, please. Please, Jack?

1077
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:50,920
它竟横着撞过来  没事  我的天
I can't believe he hit my van. Come on. It's all right.

1078
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,130
真不敢相信
Unreal.

1079
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,260
你居然没走
You didn't leave me.

1080
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:58,470
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1081
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:02,970
你留下了
You didn't leave me.

1082
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:06,270
没有别的选择
Didn't have anywhere to be just then.

1083
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,780
看看
Check it out.

1084
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,620
我要提醒你
I have to warn you.

1085
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:26,910
我听说紧张的情况下产生的感情是不会牢靠的
I've heard relationships based on intense experiences never work.

1086
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,170
好吧
OK.

1087
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:31,840
我们用爱来巩固它
We'll have to base it on sex, then.

1088
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,010
听你的  小姐
Whatever you say, ma'am.
