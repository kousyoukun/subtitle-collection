00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,618
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,155
Oh, hi. Yeah, I know.
They called me down here.

3
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,257
Some of this wiring
got screwed up.

4
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:04,259
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

5
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,260
Yeah. Just a second.

6
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,396
There you are.

it up. Good work, everybody.

with the way this worked out.

- Good for you.

Thanks for pushing that, Bob.
The light's on.

18
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,211
- But you never know.It really might be broken.
- Shut up.

00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,958
[Woman]
Peter! Come on!

30
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:47,154
Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other
elevators remain locked down and empty.

31
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:49,492
- Yes, sir.
- Now, there's no other way, no doors...

32
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,828
no other way in or out
except through access panels.

33
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,834
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:58,408
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

35
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:03,172
Bomb's already taken out cables.
Bomber wants $3 million, or he
blows the emergency brakes.

36
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:06,748
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

37
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:11,480
- That leaves 23 minutes exactly.
- Anything else that'll keep
this elevator from falling?

38
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,523
- The basement.
- The city would like to avoid
that event, Officer Traven.

39
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:18,560
- We can't just unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

40
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,856
The only way in or out
is through access panels.

41
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,296
The bomber's also wired
the hatch to trigger the bomb,

42
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,129
which seats him in the crazy
but not stupid section.

43
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,761
Sir, Harry volunteers
to examine the device.

44
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,771
Yeah, right.

45
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,536
Fine. The two of you
check it out.

46
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,703
[Man] The nearest access
panel's on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

47
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,745
I want reports only.
We're in a holding pattern.

48
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:41,783
Worthy and Briggs, I want you to secure
the base area. No one in or out.

49
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,410
Everyone else, I want you
to affirm building evac. Move!

50
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,455
Looks like we're walkin'.

- [Man]
Hurry, folks, but watch your step.
- Twenty-nine!

Who's up there?

66
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,933
Who's up there?
What's going on?

67
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:44,997
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the L.A.P.D.

68
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:48,100
- Thank God!
- What are you doing up there?

69
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:52,648
[Traven] There has been an elevator
malfunction, so just relax.

70
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:56,651
[Man] Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?

71
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:59,085
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

72
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:01,087
Am I lying?

73
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,383
How come they sent
cops here?

74
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,723
Shouldn't they send
repair guys?

75
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,889
- [Woman] Yeah.
- [Man] Doesn't make any sense.

76
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:16,333
What do you think?

77
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:21,972
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

78
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:26,811
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognize the work,
but he's a pro.

79
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:29,281
Oh, he's cuttin' it close.

80
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,284
I don't like it.

81
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:34,288
Yeah, well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

82
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,036
All right, pop quiz.
The airport.

83
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,536
Gunman with one hostage.
He's usin' her for cover.

84
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:54,269
He's almost to a plane.
You're a hundred feet away.

85
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,778
Jack.

86
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,817
Shoot the hostage.

87
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,819
What?

88
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,890
Take her
out of the equation.

89
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:11,221
Go for the good wound, and
he can't get to the plane with her.

90
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,023
- Clear shot.
- You're deeply nuts. You know that?

91
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:17,031
"Shoot the hostage."
Geez.

92
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:23,630
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

93
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,605
Why?

94
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,801
I don't know.
Gut feeling.

95
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:31,107
Well, right now Mac
outranks your gut, so we sit.

96
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,749
This is taking way too long.

97
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,983
How much you think
that elevator weighs?

98
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:40,316
Jack, come on.

99
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:43,490
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

100
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,559
We're not gonna
shoot 'em, right?

101
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,260
[Man] Hey, where are you going?
What's going on?

102
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:58,806
[Woman]
Don't go! Don't leave us here!

103
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,955
No, we just take them
out of the equation.

104
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,217
- You sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

105
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:54,630
Six minutes.

106
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:58,757
I can't get any more time.
He's not talkin'!

107
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:01,393
I need
the goddamn money now!

108
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,616
Tell me again, Harry.
Why did I take this job?

109
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:19,154
Aw, come on. Thirty more years
of this, you get a tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.

110
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,587

114

- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

Can you get her out?

Come on.
Come on, let's go!

- No. No, I can't!
- It's going to fall.

Just take one step,
reach out and take my hand.

00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:58,009
Once the bus goes 50 miles
an hour, the bomb is armed.

308
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:02,351
If it drops below 50,
it blows up.

What do you do!

You think I'm
gonna tell you that?

There are rules, Jack, and
I want you to get this right.

314
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,801
No one goes off the bus.

315
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:24,038
You try to take any passengers
off the bus, I will detonate it.

- We can't pull that
kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

318
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:35,990
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call.

319
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:41,392
The radio's down.
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.

320

It's running downtown
from Venice.

of Ocean Park and Main.

And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

You should be glad.

She was scared. She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed.

it would 've killed us all.

do it by then, I can't do it at all.

- [Harry Over Radio]
Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

What is he doing?
Oh, my God, he is insane.

906
01:13:02,402 --> 01:13:06,236
Okay, Jack, this is it.
Don't get dead.

907
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,118
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

Oh, Christ.

909
01:13:34,934 --> 01:13:36,959
Just keep it steady.

Oh, thank you for
the tip, Ortiz.

- Gosh darn.

912
01:13:54,387 --> 01:13:57,481
We're gonna have to try to bypass
the remote current with the battery.

913
01:13:57,624 --> 01:13:59,615
Can you find the trip
wire for the remote?

914
01:13:59,759 --> 01:14:02,193
I don't know.
I got a few choices here.

915
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:05,161
- Black and red?
- And green.

916
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:09,700
Okay. All right. I'm gonna
guess he's not gonna go with
standard copper for the remote.

917
01:14:09,802 --> 01:14:12,066
That'd be too weak.
I'd use a fiber alloy.

918
01:14:12,205 --> 01:14:15,265
Jack, I'm gonna need
you to look at the wire.

- Harry, it's covered.
- Yeah, I know.

920
01:14:20,013 --> 01:14:22,811
You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:24,814
Right.

to clip on the battery...

925
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:54,178
- and then run it to the lead wire.
- Copy.
