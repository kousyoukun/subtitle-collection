1
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,858
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,237
Hi. Yeah, I know. They called me down here.
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

3
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:05,741
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

4
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,974
Yeah. Just a second.

5
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,379
There you are.

6
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,489
Nothing personal.

7
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,267
Well, I guess that wraps it up.
Good work, everybody.

8
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:29,442
Marty, I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

9
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,957
Congratulations.

10
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:39,701
- Hold that.
- Whoa.

11
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:43,925
Gee, thanks.

12
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:56,123
Thanks for pushing that, Bob. The light's on,
but you never know, it might be broken.

13
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:58,259
Shut up.

14
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,339
Remember, honey...

15
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:58,013
Jesus. Bob, what button did you push?

16
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:48,487
Mr Bagwell, make sure these other elevators
remain locked down and empty.

17
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:53,288
There's no doors, no other way in or out,
except through access panels, correct?

18
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:58,209
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

19
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,086
Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million or he blows the brakes.

20
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,313
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

21
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,467
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

22
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:13,887
- Anything to keep this elevator from falling?
- The basement.

23
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,973
We'd like to avoid that, Traven.

24
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:19,434
- We can't unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

25
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:23,563
The only way in is through access panels.
The bomber's wired the hatch,

26
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:26,817
which seats him
in the "crazy but not stupid" section.

27
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:30,278
Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device.

28
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,241
- Yeah, right.
- Fine. The two of you check it out.

29
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:37,327
The nearest access panel's
on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

30
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:42,128
I want reports only. We're in a holding
pattern. Worthy, Briggs, secure the base area.

31
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,890
Everyone else,
I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

32
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:48,671
Looks like we're walkin'.

33
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,717
- Hurry, but watch your step!
- 29.

34
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:55,387
All the way down to the lobby! Let's go, folks!

35
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,127
30.

36
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,342
31.

37
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:03,994
32.

38
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:27,234
Hello?

39
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:32,262
- Come on! Get us outta here!
- Hello! Hello!

40
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,680
<i>Help! Please, get us out of here!</i>

41
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:10,727
Please!

42
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:37,419
<i>Please! Get us out of here!</i>

43
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>Who's up there?
Who's up there? What's going on?</i>

44
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:46,581
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD.

45
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:49,042
- Thank God.
- What are you doing up there?

46
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:53,843
<i>There's been
an elevator malfunction, so just relax.</i>

47
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,092
<i>Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?</i>

48
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:01,013
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

49
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,180
Am I lying?

50
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:07,981
How come they sent cops here?
Shouldn't they send repair guys?

51
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,048
What do you think?

52
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:23,869
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

53
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,436
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro.

54
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:32,210
- He's cutting it close.
- I don't like it.

55
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:35,686
Well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

56
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:49,103
All right, pop quiz.
The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

57
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:52,482
He's using her for cover.
He's almost to a plane.

58
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:55,609
You're 100 feet away.

59
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,847
Jack.

60
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:06,037
Shoot the hostage.

61
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,957
- What?
- Take her out of the equation.

62
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,169
Go for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

63
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,637
You're deeply nuts, you know that?
"Shoot the hostage."

64
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,940
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

65
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:29,227
- Why?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

66
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:32,504
Right now Mac outranks your gut, so we sit.

67
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:36,456
This is taking way too long.

68
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:38,987
How much d'you think that elevator weighs?

69
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,469
Jack, come on.

70
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:47,078
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

71
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,055
<i>We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?</i>

72
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,597
<i>Hey, where you going?
What's going on?</i>

73
00:11:55,586 --> 00:12:00,153
<i>Don't go! Don't leave us here!</i>

74
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:17,663
No, we just take them out of the equation.

75
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:53,712
- Are you sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

76
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:56,521
Six minutes.

77
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:00,025
I can't get any more time. He's not talking!

78
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,706
I need the goddamn money now.

79
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:15,833
Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job?

80
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:20,129
Oh, come on. 30 more years of this, you get
a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

81
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,923
Cool.

82
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:23,710
Ho!

83
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:57,499
- God, it's hot in here.
- There's no air.

84
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,074
- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

85
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:08,694
Don't fuck with Daddy.

86
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:44,925
Usually they fall down now.

87
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:56,907
He's early. The son of a bitch is early!

88
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:18,556
Mac, we need more help up here now!

89
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:22,292
Oh, please! I don't wanna die!

90
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,882
Please save us!

91
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:33,391
<i>Open the door!
Open the door, please!</i>

92
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:40,727
<i>- Please help me!
- We'll get you out!</i>

93
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:45,528
- Give me your hands! It's OK.
- Pull me through.

94
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:56,077
<i>Watch your head. Watch your head.</i>

95
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,080
<i>- OK, I've got you.
- Take it easy.</i>

96
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:01,916
- You're fine. You're fine.
- Thank you.

97
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,052
- Take her.
- Who's next?

98
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,213
Thank you.

99
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:12,204
We've got you, ma'am.

100
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:21,304
- What the hell is all this?
- Help us! Hurry!

101
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:27,275
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

102
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:28,963
Come on. Come on.

103
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:36,326
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

104
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:40,297
- Help me out! Please, help me out.
- Watch your head.

105
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,498
- Come on, lady!
- No.

106
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:45,725
Come on, lady! Come on! Grab my hand!

107
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,093
- Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall!
- No!

108
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,428
No, I can't!

109
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:58,973
Just take one step, reach out
and take my hand.

110
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:02,250
Come on! Come on!

111
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:09,612
- Oh, God! Don't let go of me!
- You're OK.

112
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,814
My shoe!

113
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:30,921
Was it good for you?

114
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:34,049
It was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?

115
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,772
- Elevator dropped.
- Good. That's good to know.

116
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:46,144
- Is your watch slow?
- No. He jumped the gun.

117
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,773
- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?

118
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,692
He's losing his $3 million.

119
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,611
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough.

120
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:59,412
It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.

121
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:09,084
- He's here.
- He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.

122
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:13,885
No. He knew we were up to something.
He's close by.

123
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:19,057
He's not gonna corner himself in a building
we evacuated anyway. Come on.

124
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:29,567
He'd... he'd wanna be here,
but he'd wanna stay mobile, right?

125
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:35,361
The elevators.

126
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:38,781
Passenger cars were stopped.
They checked 'em out.

127
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:41,711
What about the freight elevators?

128
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,320
- Will the mystery guest please sign in?
- What?

129
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,857
Jack!

130
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:15,339
Damn it.

131
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,769
<i>Get to the side!</i>

132
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:16,234
<i>Shit! Shit! Shit!</i>

133
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:20,679
Up! Get your ass up!

134
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:08,476
I don't suppose anybody'll give me
three million just for you.

135
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,623
Hold it!

136
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:21,611
Pop quiz, hotshot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage.

137
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:26,412
Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to
blow a building in half. Now what do you do?

138
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:30,203
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

139
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:32,497
Standard flanking deployment, right?

140
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:37,298
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor, huh?
At least that's what they'll think.

141
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:43,967
I want location on those goddamn shots!
Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

142
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:48,137
Lieutenant, we've got movement
on the freight elevator.

143
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:56,738
It's on three. Let's move!

144
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:04,074
End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing, I don't mind saying.

145
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:06,155
Because you didn't kill everyone?

146
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:10,159
There will come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you'd never met me.

147
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,287
Mister, I'm already there.

148
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:17,088
I'm in charge here. I drop this stick
and they pick your friend up with a sponge.

149
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:23,297
- Are you ready to die, friend?
- Fuck you.

150
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:27,801
In 200 years, we've come from "I regret
but I have one life to give for my country"

151
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:29,011
to "fuck you"?

152
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:32,264
- Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up, Harry.

153
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:35,559
We've got all the balls
in the world right here, man.

154
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,091
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

155
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,705
Shoot the hostage.

156
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:45,073
Say goodbye, Harry.

157
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,689
You fuck!

158
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,393
Freeze!

159
00:22:56,998 --> 00:22:58,457
Freeze!

160
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,982
Give it up! You're out of options!

161
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:29,530
Through dedication and bravery,
these next two officers effected the rescue

162
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:32,617
of 13 citizens of this city.

163
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:37,413
And, thanks to them, the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

164
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,916
You shot me. I can't believe it.

165
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:43,169
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.

166
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,714
Harry, you told me to.

167
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,694
...the Los Angeles Police Department.

168
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,534
Officer Harry Temple.

169
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:10,023
<i>Officer Jack Traven.</i>

170
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:30,341
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

171
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:33,011
- There we go.
- Harry, my man.

172
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:37,140
Beautiful. A toast to me.
Make me feel good about myself.

173
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,976
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

174
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:42,228
OK, so how we doing? Whoa, whoa.

175
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:45,853
Shit. I need a bib!

176
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:51,080
- Here we go. All right.
- You can't take me anywhere.

177
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,307
And here is to Harry,

178
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:57,396
for his quick thinking,

179
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:02,248
for his grace under pressure
and for his brave and selfless act.

180
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:04,731
<i>Hear! Hear!</i>

181
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:10,340
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

182
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,760
Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.

183
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,429
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

184
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,556
OK, no, no. Here it is.

185
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:23,357
Here's to you guys for doing yourjob
and for not getting dead.

186
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:26,501
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

187
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:37,951
We are the two luckiest guys in the world.

188
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:40,995
We got the bad guy
and we didn't lose any civilians.

189
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:43,331
- We're good.
- No. You were lucky.

190
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:47,209
No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it.

191
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,962
We were dealing with a total psycho.

192
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:53,685
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

193
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,944
And I got a bullet in me.

194
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,223
Six inches off the mark,
and they're giving the medal to my wife.

195
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:04,643
Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won. We got him.

196
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:07,646
Do you listen? Do you ever?

197
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:12,447
Because I am not gonna be around
to back you up, so you better start thinking.

198
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:18,620
Guts'll get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.

199
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:24,329
Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief?

200
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,216
That's right.

201
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:28,667
Ho!

202
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:33,468
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm gonna go home, have some sex.

203
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:40,643
- Harry, you're gonna go home and puke.
- Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

204
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:44,136
Come on, you gimp.

205
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,751
- Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

206
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:12,211
- You looked fat.
- Take it easy on him, Bob.

207
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:15,590
- The boy was up late last night partying.
- Wild party, huh?

208
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:20,011
I don't remember that well.
Couldn't have been too great. Woke up alone.

209
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:24,812
Yeah? The last time I partied like that,
I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

210
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,228
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

211
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,522
- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care.

212
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,509
Thanks.

213
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:47,643
See you tomorrow.

214
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:06,159
What do you think, Jack?

215
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,960
You think if you pick up all the bus driver's
teeth, they'll give you another medal?

216
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:12,290
Jesus!

217
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,960
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

218
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:19,761
Two years I spent setting up that elevatorjob.
Two years I invested myself in it.

219
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,761
<i>You couldn't understand
the kind of commitment that I have.</i>

220
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:28,097
You ruined a man's life's work
and you think you can walk away?

221
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:32,898
You got blinders on to the world,
but I got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

222
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:38,112
<i>- Why didn't you just come after me?
- This is about me. This is about my money.</i>

223
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,195
This is about money due me,
which I will collect.

224
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:44,826
$3.7 million.

225
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:49,369
<i>It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.</i>

226
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,080
<i>- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.</i>

227
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,958
There's a bomb on a bus.

228
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,253
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour,
the bomb is armed.

229
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:03,841
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

230
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:07,218
What do you do? What do you do?

231
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:12,563
<i>- I'd wanna know what bus it was.
- You think I'm gonna tell you that?</i>

232
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,936
<i>- Yes.
- Very good.</i>

233
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:18,439
<i>There are rules, Jack,
and I want you to get this right.</i>

234
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,984
No one goes off the bus.

235
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,113
You try to take any passengers off the bus,
I will detonate it.

236
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,588
I want my money by 11am.

237
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:33,454
- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

238
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:38,255
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call. The radio's down.

239
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:43,969
<i>Now, the number of the bus is 2525.
It's running downtown from Venice.</i>

240
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:49,807
It is at the corner of Ocean Park and Main.

241
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,225
Sam!

242
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:06,570
Sam!

243
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:08,071
Annie.

244
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:10,032
Sam! Tell him to stop!

245
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:13,755
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through! Sam!

246
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:18,248
- Sam!
- This ain't no bus stop.

247
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:20,542
- Come on.
- Get rid of your butt, Annie.

248
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:23,253
OK, it's gone, it's gone.

249
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:28,054
You are a good, kind man. One day
people are gonna write songs about you.

250
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:39,625
- Hi.
- Hi.

251
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:52,533
- First time in LA.
- Oh, no. I live here.

252
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:55,746
<i>No, I mean mine. Oh, that's just funny.</i>

253
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,791
- You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing.
- Oh, really?

254
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:03,462
Yeah. I hate to use the word "tourist",
but it's not like I can hide it.

255
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,944
Not really.

256
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,851
Aw, jeez. You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport. I got so lost.

257
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,477
LA is one large place. Course, you live here.
You probably don't notice.

258
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,106
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

259
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,567
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

260
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,050
Gum.

261
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,929
Excuse me.

262
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,299
- Morning.
- Hi.

263
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:40,516
I just couldn't handle the freeways any more.

264
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:42,685
I got so tense.

265
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:45,772
This way, I can just relax all the way to work.

266
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:50,339
Yeah, well, I love my car. I miss my car.

267
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:04,896
<i>Oh, God. Look at that.</i>

268
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,419
<i>- Hey, Sam!
- Shit.</i>

269
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,338
- Sam!
- What?

270
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:15,139
- Why don't you just drive over these people?
- Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

271
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:17,568
Such a mess.

272
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,119
Stop!

273
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:44,330
- Open up!
- Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

274
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,500
- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!

275
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:50,295
<i>- Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!
- LAPD!</i>

276
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,380
- I can't hear you!
- Stop this bus!

277
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,382
<i>What?</i>

278
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,427
LAPD! Stop the bus!

279
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,355
LAPD!

280
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,373
Stop! Stop!

281
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,522
- Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car.
- Jesus, not again.

282
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:13,568
This is my car. I own this car. It's not stolen.

283
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,987
- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck!

284
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,788
Man, you scratch this puppy, and me and you
are gonna have words, you understand?

285
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:44,603
OK, look, man, we don't have to go so fast.
Just slow down a little bit.

286
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,686
Oh, shit. Come on, man.

287
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:52,311
Just... just don't tear up my car, all right?

288
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:56,487
OK, OK. Just slow down just a bit, all right?

289
00:35:56,488 --> 00:36:00,954
We don't have to go so fast, do we?
We don't have to go so...

290
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,978
That was a nice move, man.

291
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,522
Whoo!

292
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,717
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

293
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:22,845
The least you could do is slow down.
Come on.

294
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,511
Oh, shit.

295
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,868
Oh, shit!

296
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,959
Move! Move!

297
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:35,942
Is that that guy?

298
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,872
Man sure has a hard-on for this bus.

299
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,921
Hey! I'm a cop!

300
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,411
What?

301
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,508
I'm a cop!

302
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:05,309
LAPD! There's a bomb on your bus!

303
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,099
- What?
- There's a bomb on your bus!

304
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,352
There's a... What? Fuck!

305
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:15,482
- There's a bomb on your bus!
- Watch the road!

306
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,943
Grab that. I want you to write on it.

307
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,468
I want you to write on the back:
"Bomb on bus."

308
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,493
Write it, write it, write it!

309
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,051
Watch the road. Oh, shit.

310
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,238
Oh, shit!

311
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,983
No!

312
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,615
Don't slow down!

313
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:07,658
No! No, no, no, no, no!

314
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,083
Speed up!

315
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,621
Op...

316
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,831
Open your door!

317
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:16,662
Open the doors!

318
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:21,684
50! Stay above 50!

319
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,487
All right?

320
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,371
4708000. Ask for Detective Harry Temple.

321
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,312
Harry.

322
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,795
Harry, it's Jack.

323
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,196
You better not be calling in sick,
cos I dragged my ass...

324
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,116
- Harry, he's alive.
- What?

325
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,451
<i>The bomber. He's back.</i>

326
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,788
He hit one in Venice already.
There's nothing left.

327
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,375
We got a ransom demand from your
dead terrorist. Says he's rigged a bus.

328
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,627
- Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?

329
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,755
- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...

330
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,966
Yeah, yeah. You get on the bus.

331
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,302
Drive straight!

332
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,132
Stay in this lane!

333
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,521
Watch the road.

334
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,645
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?

335
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,426
- Are you insured?
- Yeah! Why?

336
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,234
No! No!

337
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,282
You broke my... my door.

338
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:34,083
- Sir, I need to take your phone.
- Take the phone.

339
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,455
- Take the wheel.
- What are you... What?

340
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,663
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

341
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:48,497
Drive straight.

342
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,741
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

343
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,922
Oh, shit!

344
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:08,543
Whoa! Shit!

345
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,830
This guy's out of his mind.

346
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,384
OK, listen, you gotta stay above 50.

347
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:33,100
- Excuse me, are you out of your mind?
- Whatever it takes.

348
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,684
Everybody, I'm Jack Traven, LAPD.

349
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:40,020
We have a slight situation on the bus.
If you'll please sit down.

350
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,737
- You're scaring the shit out of these people.
- Ma'am, please!

351
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:51,657
If everybody will stay in your seats
and remain calm,

352
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,493
we should be able to defuse the problem...

353
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,323
Get away from me!

354
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:05,129
I don't know you, man.
I'm not here for you. Let's not do this.

355
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,797
- Stop the bus!
- He can't.

356
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,009
Shut up! Stop the bus! Stop it!

357
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,491
Listen!

358
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,993
Look, I'm putting my gun away, OK?

359
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,335
OK?

360
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:26,650
Now, listen. I don't care about your crime.

361
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:31,451
Whatever you did, I'm sure that you're sorry,
so it's cool now. It's over.

362
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,057
And I'm not a cop right now.

363
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:47,091
See? We're just two cool guys,
just hanging out...

364
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:52,215
Sam!

365
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,742
I've got the wheel! I've got it!
Sam! Oh God, Sam!

366
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:10,448
<i>You've gotta move your legs.
Can somebody move his legs?</i>

367
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:15,406
Sam, get your foot...
Sam, get your foot off the pedal!

368
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:19,410
- I gotta stop this thing!
- No! Don't! Stay above 50!

369
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:24,211
- Sam's been shot! We gotta get him off!
- You slow down and this bus'll explode!

370
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,049
There is a bomb on this bus.

371
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,327
If we slow down, it'll blow.

372
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,350
If anyone tries to get off, it'll explode.

373
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,936
Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.

374
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:47,231
- Some funny joke, man.
- Are we gonna have a problem now?

375
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,401
He's bleeding so much.
I don't know what to do.

376
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:55,202
Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.

377
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:58,993
- Hold on, man.
- Sam, lift your head.

378
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:02,621
- Can you handle this bus?
- Sure. It's like driving a really big Pinto.

379
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:07,422
- I need to know! Can you handle it?
- I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is.

380
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,088
- Is there a plan?
- For you to drive. We're OK for now.

381
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,869
- Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.

382
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,554
- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right.

383
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:24,355
Well, I should probably tell you that
I had my driver's licence revoked.

384
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,822
- What for?
- Speeding.

385
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:35,320
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.
If anything changes, let us know.

386
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,795
Anything we haven't seen
should be in here.

387
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,690
<i>... wrong with the driver,
but at least one car, a Jaguar,</i>

388
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,945
<i>has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.</i>

389
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,490
<i>The bus came onto the freeway
at the Lincoln onramp.</i>

390
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,410
<i>It began picking up speed, swerving,
and hasn't slowed down since.</i>

391
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:29,211
<i>Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus
by jumping onto it from a moving car.</i>

392
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:33,218
Would that be you, Jack?

393
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,673
<i>- Where do we start?
- The speedometer.</i>

394
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:39,969
Has it been fucked with or loosened?
See any wires or anything?

395
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,929
Excuse me, ma'am.

396
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,098
No, it's clean.

397
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:47,685
Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably rigged to one of the axles.

398
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:51,063
I can't get under the bus right now.
It's kind of in motion.

399
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,844
Excuse me! Excuse me!

400
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,609
Hold on.

401
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,936
Access panel... in the floor.

402
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,053
Underneath you, man.

403
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:08,667
All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay.
Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see.

404
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,626
OK.

405
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,588
We got a wad! Pretty big!

406
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,216
- There's a pretty big wad.
- Brass fittings!

407
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,678
- Brass fittings.
- I think I can reach the circuit wire.

408
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:27,182
- He can reach the circuit wire.
- No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic.

409
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,268
<i>- Classic decoy.
- What else?</i>

410
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,562
- What else?
- Hold on.

411
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,094
Hold on.

412
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,161
Fuck me!

413
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:47,725
Oh, darn.

414
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:54,251
Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing
to put a hole in the world.

415
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,338
OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

416
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:00,883
Three triggers - one on the axle
I can't really see, a cellular remote

417
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:04,762
and a timer running off a wristwatch.

418
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,264
<i>- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.</i>

419
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,558
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

420
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,935
Officer!

421
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,438
- Officer!
- What's on your mind, Harry?

422
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,070
Shit. What do I do? Officer!

423
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:18,984
- What do I do?
- Oh, shit.

424
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,737
- Which way? Which way?!
- Get on the shoulder.

425
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:23,028
OK.

426
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,118
Watch it!

427
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:48,137
Stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?

428
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,712
Off! Off! Hold on!

429
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,644
Oh, God.

430
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,334
<i>- Keep going.
- It's red!</i>

431
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,362
Go! Go!

432
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,554
This is much better.

433
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,490
<i>... city streets. The bus is on Western,
heading in a southbound direction.</i>

434
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,948
<i>Now, where the bus did exit here,
it had a couple of close calls.</i>

435
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,175
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

436
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,366
<i>We don't know what authorities plan to do.</i>

437
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,425
<i>I don't get it.</i>

438
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:10,137
The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he saying?

439
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:13,557
- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no MO.

440
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,436
A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb and they're very monogamous.

441
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:22,237
This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger
every time, and now he throws in this watch.

442
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,945
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.

443
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:29,668
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

444
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,681
Wait a minute.

445
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,080
I wanna look at the files for the last 10 years.

446
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:41,881
- We did the mug shots. It's not gonna help.
- No. I wanna look at cops.

447
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,736
Come on. Let's go.

448
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:53,180
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

449
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:56,100
I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.

450
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:59,395
I can see you. Just keep going straight.

451
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:04,012
I'm gonna try to clear the roads for you.
Just stay on line.

452
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:09,446
Shit! Oh, Jesus! God! No!

453
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,688
Go left!

454
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:15,049
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God!

455
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,218
Oh, jeez!

456
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,967
People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!

457
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:34,534
- Ma'am, up to the right.
- OK, OK, OK. I see it, I see it.

458
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:44,433
Mac! Mac, you've gotta get me outta here!

459
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:51,363
A few more blocks,
you're gonna come up to a soft turn. Right.

460
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:54,658
Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there.

461
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:59,459
They're gonna lead you to the 105 freeway.
It's not in use. It'll be empty.

462
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:03,023
<i>- You'll be totally clear.
- Got it.</i>

463
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:10,429
<i>In a few blocks,
we take the soft turn to the right.</i>

464
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:16,387
OK. Wait a minute. Escort to where?
Where do we get an escort to?

465
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,820
Look out!

466
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,874
Oh, God!

467
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,858
Son of a bitch!

468
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,886
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

469
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,242
- Oh, God! I just hit the baby!
- Cans!

470
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:42,043
- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?

471
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,718
Oh, jeez. No! No! No!

472
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,823
- Why aren't they at school?
- Mac, we're boned.

473
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:18,008
I'll get you out, Jack.

474
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:30,379
All right, listen.
You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

475
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,257
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

476
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:35,789
- How ugly?
- What's ugly?

477
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:40,055
We got a hard right coming up
at the construction site.

478
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:43,017
- This should be it.
- That is a dead end.

479
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:47,521
- I can't make that turn.
- You can make it. Keep left. Make it wide.

480
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:50,899
Oh, God. We're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.

481
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,903
You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!

482
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,823
On this side of the bus!
As far as you can, please.

483
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,991
Hold on!

484
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:04,792
Over here. Over here. As far as you can! Now!
Mac, you better clear this site out.

485
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,964
- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!

486
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,546
Hold on!

487
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:23,561
Hold on! Oh, God! Here we go! Here we go!

488
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,904
Here we go!

489
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,575
Whoo!

490
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,536
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Is everybody all right?

491
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,872
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

492
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,049
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

493
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:05,391
Oh, my God. We might've died. I can't think.

494
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:09,809
It's OK. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

495
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:31,751
Frank, get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

496
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:35,839
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.
No obstructions in the freeway.

497
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,059
We have a window here.
I wanna make sure it stays open.

498
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,978
Shoot.

499
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:06,702
Could you do me a favour
and hold the wheel for me for a second?

500
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:09,204
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

501
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:14,005
Ma'am, you did very well. Actually, you were
incredible. I've never seen driving like that.

502
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,212
- Annie.
- What?

503
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,447
It's my name. Annie.

504
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,926
- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am".

505
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,764
OK.

506
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:31,518
So, why is all this happening?

507
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,273
I mean, what did we do?
Bomb the guy's country or something?

508
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:39,500
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

509
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:44,424
I don't buy that.
It's not a very good way to make money.

510
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:49,294
So, um... what is this guy's deal?

511
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:53,248
A while back,
he held some people for ransom.

512
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:56,543
It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

513
00:54:56,544 --> 00:55:00,756
- What does that have to do with us?
- Nothing. It's a game.

514
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:04,385
If he gets the money, he wins.
If the bus blows up, he wins.

515
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:07,137
- What if you win?
- Tomorrow we'll play another one.

516
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:10,812
But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.

517
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:16,897
We got no match for that description.

518
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,650
No one's lost a thumb
for at least the last 10 years.

519
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:23,070
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

520
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:26,365
Forget the files.
Start going through the pension fund.

521
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:30,285
This guy's drawing disability. He may not
be LAPD, but he's living here now.

522
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:34,206
I want pictures! I've seen this asshole.

523
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,307
- Hey! Let's get these passengers off the bus!
- We can't do it, sir!

524
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:56,312
There's no time for any stunts.
We gotta get these people out of harm's way.

525
00:55:56,313 --> 00:56:00,333
I got orders. We move these people, he'll see.

526
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:04,695
Remember: Crazy, not stupid.

527
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:09,199
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is.
We think maybe he's a cop.

528
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,952
Lieutenant, it's him.

529
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,456
- He wants to talk to Jack.
- He's on the line for you.

530
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:20,122
- OK, give him the number.
- Give him the number.

531
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,548
- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...

532
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:28,260
- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.

533
00:56:28,261 --> 00:56:33,061
Hey, your taxes are paying their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

534
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:37,780
I mean, you know.

535
00:56:41,091 --> 00:56:42,107
Yeah.

536
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:46,908
I think we have trust, but it looks on TV
like you're trying to get those passengers off.

537
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,492
<i>- Look, you've gotta let me have one.
- We went over the rules.</i>

538
00:56:51,493 --> 00:56:55,537
As an act of faith. We have
an injured man here. The driver's been shot.

539
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:58,332
Tell me you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

540
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:03,133
I thought it was customary
for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

541
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,299
- This man has no time.
- No one gets off.

542
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,100
It'll grease the wheels with the money men.
There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.

543
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:16,809
OK, son, you can try and unload the driver.

544
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:21,230
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel
not to slow down, though,

545
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:26,031
or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death. And, Jack, don't slip.

546
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:32,079
- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood! Get us closer!

547
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:35,369
- We're gonna get the driver off.
- Just him?

548
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,705
- For now. Gigantor.
- Ortiz.

549
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:41,792
Ortiz, we're gonna need your help.
I need you to pass him to me.

550
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:44,253
Keep him straight, or the wound'll tear.

551
00:57:44,254 --> 00:57:48,721
- What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey, hey! Lady!

552
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:52,241
<i>I can't stay!</i>

553
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:56,098
- How are you feeling?
- Like I've been shot.

554
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,580
- Take care, Sam.
- OK, Annie.

555
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:02,221
Drive straight!

556
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:08,902
- Get as close as you can, OK?
- All right.

557
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:13,123
Closer. A little closer, Annie.

558
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,640
- Annie, a little closer.
- OK.

559
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:21,432
<i>OK, how's this?</i>

560
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:24,877
Sorry. Sorry.

561
00:58:24,878 --> 00:58:29,097
OK, Annie. No problem.
Let's try it one more time.

562
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,133
A little more!

563
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:34,858
OK! OK! Right there! Steady! Hold it steady!

564
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:38,583
You got him? You got him?

565
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:47,484
I'm all right. Thanks.

566
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:50,462
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

567
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:02,102
<i>He's gonna be OK.</i>

568
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,919
Come on! Come on, lady. Give me your hand.

569
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,755
- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen!

570
00:59:09,756 --> 00:59:12,049
- No, Helen, no!
- Come on!

571
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,217
Helen, no! No!

572
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:18,018
<i>I'm here at the 105 Freeway, where the police
have successfully led the runaway bus...</i>

573
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:23,129
No, Helen!

574
00:59:38,285 --> 00:59:41,704
Goddamn it, Mac!
Get those fucking choppers outta here!

575
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:45,082
<i>... was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...</i>

576
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:48,043
<i>An explosion. Some kind of an explosion.</i>

577
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:51,213
<i>The bus hasn't exploded, but... Oh, my God.</i>

578
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:55,718
<i>A woman caught in the blast fell. She was
pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.</i>

579
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:00,519
Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future, huh?

580
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:24,309
I can't be here.

581
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:27,839
I can't, you know...

582
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:30,669
This is the wrong bus.

583
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,152
I mean, for me to...

584
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:36,634
I can't die here.

585
01:00:36,635 --> 01:00:39,116
Hey, shut up, man.

586
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,389
- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?

587
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:47,060
Hey! So if you have a wife and I don't,
does that mean I'm expendable?

588
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:49,437
What are you talking about, man?

589
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,731
The guy's just talking crazy.

590
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,817
He gets on my nerves.
He gets on everybody's nerves.

591
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:59,618
- I think I have the right to be a little upset.
- What are you staring at, anyway?

592
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,409
Why don't you let us all die in peace,
if it has to happen?

593
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:08,210
Oh, so you're a really tough guy, huh?
Why don't we just step outside?

594
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,855
Hey!

595
01:01:24,474 --> 01:01:27,453
How are you doing? You all right?

596
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:30,336
What can I do?

597
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:34,150
When that bomb went off...

598
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:36,152
I know.

599
01:01:36,153 --> 01:01:40,953
I thought that was it.
I thought that was the bomb, and I was dead.

600
01:01:41,117 --> 01:01:45,537
And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

601
01:01:45,538 --> 01:01:48,515
You were glad you were still alive.

602
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:52,961
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

603
01:01:52,962 --> 01:01:55,939
You should be glad. We all are.

604
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:00,760
- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.

605
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:04,055
She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed,

606
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:07,225
but if she'd gotten off,
it would have killed us all.

607
01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:11,771
He's the asshole, Annie. The guy
who put us here. Remember that, OK?

608
01:02:11,772 --> 01:02:15,098
Big asshole.

609
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:17,799
OK.

610
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:21,865
Are you sure?

611
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:24,347
Well, how far?

612
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:29,459
Sir, we have a serious problem.

613
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:31,665
What?

614
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:35,836
- This freeway isn't finished.
- What are you talking about?

615
01:02:35,837 --> 01:02:40,637
The aerial unit caught it. About three miles
ahead there's a section missing.

616
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:43,782
A section missing?

617
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:52,394
But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!

618
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:54,877
I guess they fell behind.

619
01:02:55,982 --> 01:03:00,201
Fuck! You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!

620
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:03,280
Get me closer!

621
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:06,706
Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror.

622
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,391
Jack!

623
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:15,566
- How big is the section?
- 50 feet... at least.

624
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:24,009
There's a gap in the road up ahead. It's big.

625
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,055
- You're kidding. How big?
- 50 feet.

626
01:03:28,056 --> 01:03:29,598
What?

627
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,101
We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.

628
01:03:32,102 --> 01:03:35,271
You know I can't.

629
01:03:35,272 --> 01:03:38,249
<i>What did he say? Jack?</i>

630
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:42,004
Jack, what did he say?

631
01:03:43,113 --> 01:03:45,793
What's the matter?

632
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:54,457
- There's a gap in the freeway.
- What?

633
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:57,460
<i>- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?</i>

634
01:03:57,461 --> 01:04:00,672
50 feet. A couple of miles ahead.

635
01:04:00,673 --> 01:04:03,154
<i>This is crazy.</i>

636
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:09,764
<i>- Jeez.
- Jack.</i>

637
01:04:09,765 --> 01:04:13,642
Jack. What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?

638
01:04:13,643 --> 01:04:17,962
- No, he'd have thought of that.
- What, then? What? What?

639
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:20,774
What? Jack?

640
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,401
- Floor it.
- What?

641
01:04:22,402 --> 01:04:25,821
Floor it. It's an interchange.
There might be an incline.

642
01:04:25,822 --> 01:04:27,907
Fine.

643
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:34,163
Everybody hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

644
01:04:34,164 --> 01:04:37,333
When we hit the gap, heads down.

645
01:04:37,334 --> 01:04:39,752
That's it? That's it?

646
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:44,553
That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?

647
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:47,945
Put your bags underneath the seat.

648
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:56,292
- Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy.
- Hold on.

649
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,688
Is this really gonna work?

650
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:01,278
<i>Jack.</i>

651
01:05:03,193 --> 01:05:05,569
Yeah?

652
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:08,052
Jack.

653
01:05:27,926 --> 01:05:31,512
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, God.</i>

654
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:34,243
- Come on!
- Oh, God.

655
01:05:43,108 --> 01:05:44,498
Oh, shit.

656
01:05:57,707 --> 01:06:00,981
Everybody hold on!

657
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,180
Oh, God. Jack.

658
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:28,507
<i>Shit!</i>

659
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:54,350
Yes! We are way out of control!

660
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:02,812
- You OK?
- Yeah.

661
01:07:02,813 --> 01:07:04,481
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

662
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:07,817
All right! Norwood, let's go!

663
01:07:07,818 --> 01:07:11,243
- Is everybody OK?
- Yes!

664
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:15,951
<i>We did it!</i>

665
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:18,244
We made it.

666
01:07:18,245 --> 01:07:21,422
You're the man. You are the man!

667
01:07:21,582 --> 01:07:24,064
Thank you. Thank you very much.

668
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,295
Oh, shit.

669
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:31,466
- I think you missed your calling.
- Yeah? What was it?

670
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:34,260
Watch the road.
You should have been a pilot.

671
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:35,502
Ow.

672
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:43,394
- Get off.
- What?

673
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:45,876
Get off this. Now. Get off this.

674
01:07:51,653 --> 01:07:53,445
In there.

675
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:55,447
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah.

676
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,135
- Right here?
- Yeah.

677
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:16,594
- He's just entered the airport.
- There's thousands of people there.

678
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:20,014
That's my boy Jack. He can circle
the runways and buy us some time.

679
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:24,815
- Choppers can't fly there. It's restricted.
- He's headed for the end of the field.

680
01:08:24,936 --> 01:08:29,736
- Bravo Tango, an emergency runway.
- Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

681
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:45,164
We're at the airport.

682
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:47,646
Yeah? So?

683
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:50,774
I already seen the airport.

684
01:09:11,358 --> 01:09:15,278
- Yeah?
- Very, very exciting, Jack.

685
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:19,616
Some close calls, huh?
But you've done all right for yourself.

686
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:22,911
- What do you want?
- I want money, Jack.

687
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:27,712
I wish I had some loftier purpose, but
I'm afraid in the end it's just the money, Jack.

688
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:33,967
I would like large non-sequential bills
in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

689
01:09:36,424 --> 01:09:40,302
- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?

690
01:09:40,303 --> 01:09:43,639
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

691
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,601
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you
like they're your best friend

692
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:49,770
and they don't even know you.

693
01:09:49,771 --> 01:09:54,275
Why are they messing with me, huh?
Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

694
01:09:54,276 --> 01:09:57,778
<i>- Aren't you?
- Oh, that's unfair, Jack.</i>

695
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:02,284
You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.

696
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,786
You want a shitload of money
you didn't earn.

697
01:10:04,787 --> 01:10:07,080
Oh, I earned it.

698
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:09,416
I spent my life earning it.

699
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:14,217
<i>I got a medal, too, Jack, a medal and
a pink slip and a "sorry about your hand".</i>

700
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:18,425
- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no.

701
01:10:18,426 --> 01:10:21,386
- That's not good.
- You want me to help you?

702
01:10:21,387 --> 01:10:25,181
I need to talk to these people face to face.
They think you're bullshit.

703
01:10:25,182 --> 01:10:27,350
They don't think that.

704
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:32,147
Look, you want the money, I don't want
anyone else to die. Let me get on the ground.

705
01:10:32,148 --> 01:10:35,317
Just me. That's not against the rules.

706
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,849
All right. I want you back real fast.

707
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:40,238
Fine.

708
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:44,117
<i>Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.</i>

709
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:47,593
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

710
01:10:56,339 --> 01:11:00,133
- So I guess there's a plan now?
- Could be.

711
01:11:00,134 --> 01:11:02,385
- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.

712
01:11:02,386 --> 01:11:06,258
- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

713
01:11:07,391 --> 01:11:11,269
- Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
- Do you think that's a good idea?

714
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:14,063
- It'll be OK.
- Are you just gonna leave us here?

715
01:11:14,064 --> 01:11:17,441
- I would.
- Don't worry. I won't go far.

716
01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:21,661
Hey. Don't forget about us.

717
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:38,963
The choppers are gone.
Let's dump the passengers.

718
01:11:38,964 --> 01:11:41,465
- He's ready for that.
- How is that possible?

719
01:11:41,466 --> 01:11:45,719
I don't know how. I just know he is.
He's been a step ahead every time.

720
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,056
- If we unload, he'll take them out.
- So where does that put us?

721
01:11:49,057 --> 01:11:51,684
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

722
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:54,396
After an incredible ride on the 10 freeway,

723
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:57,065
the streets of Los Angeles
and the 105 freeway,

724
01:11:57,066 --> 01:12:01,866
this bus has ended up here at Los Angeles
International Airport, circling the runway.

725
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,210
I'm telling you, he's somewhere jerking off.

726
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:21,089
He didn't have to get
on the bus in the first place, Ortiz.

727
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,770
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

728
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:29,741
What is that?

729
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:35,083
<i>I have no idea.</i>

730
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:40,609
We won't be able to hold this steady for long.

731
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:45,196
I just need a few minutes.
If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all.

732
01:12:45,197 --> 01:12:49,218
<i>- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be careful, Jack.</i>

733
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:57,730
What's he doing? Oh, my God. He is insane.

734
01:13:03,048 --> 01:13:07,614
OK, Jack, this is it. Don't get dead.

735
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:23,943
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

736
01:13:23,944 --> 01:13:25,135
Oh, Christ.

737
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:37,665
Just keep it steady.

738
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:40,643
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

739
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,974
<i>This guy is nuts!</i>

740
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:58,269
We'll try to bypass the remote current
with the battery.

741
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:03,023
- Can you find the tripwire for the remote?
- I don't know. I got a few choices here.

742
01:14:03,024 --> 01:14:05,859
<i>- Black and red?
- And green.</i>

743
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:10,322
OK, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go
with standard copper for the remote.

744
01:14:10,323 --> 01:14:12,825
That'd be too weak. I'd use a fibre alloy.

745
01:14:12,826 --> 01:14:16,548
<i>Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire.</i>

746
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,624
Harry, it's covered.

747
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:24,045
I know. You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

748
01:14:24,046 --> 01:14:26,528
Right.

749
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:40,626
Fuck me!

750
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:44,045
<i>Shit!</i>

751
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:50,155
<i>- Bull's-eye!
- Great.</i>

752
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:53,825
OK. I want you to clip on the battery
and then run it to the lead wire.

753
01:14:53,826 --> 01:14:55,017
<i>Copy.</i>

754
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:14,179
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

755
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,157
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

756
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:22,734
Howard Payne, Atlanta PD Bomb Squad.
Retired in Sun Valley in 1989

757
01:15:23,814 --> 01:15:27,275
when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.

758
01:15:27,276 --> 01:15:30,779
That's our scumbag!
We got him. Jack, we found him.

759
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,658
- We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
- Jack, get out of there.

760
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:37,785
- We're going after the source.
- Watch your back.

761
01:15:39,288 --> 01:15:40,579
Wait for me!

762
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,017
Mac, get me outta here.

763
01:15:55,888 --> 01:16:00,504
Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back. Go!

764
01:16:11,237 --> 01:16:13,738
<i>- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us.</i>

765
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:15,949
- What?
- He's not back here.

766
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,450
Oh, my God. Go look!

767
01:16:17,451 --> 01:16:22,251
Lay down and look under the bus
and see if you can see him down there.

768
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,708
- Can you see him?
- No.

769
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:27,751
You don't see him
back by the tyre or something?

770
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:30,045
- I can't see him.
- Are you sure?

771
01:16:30,046 --> 01:16:31,733
I can't see him.

772
01:16:53,862 --> 01:16:57,698
Oh, my God! We hit him!
Oh, my God! Do you see him?

773
01:16:57,699 --> 01:17:01,174
<i>- Did we hit him?
- Look out the sides.</i>

774
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:11,723
- My tools!
- Will somebody get him his tools?!

775
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:26,079
<i>Please help him! Hurry!</i>

776
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:29,588
God, we're dragging him. Do you see him?

777
01:17:29,774 --> 01:17:32,454
Where is he? Is he there?

778
01:17:33,694 --> 01:17:37,906
<i>- Do you see him?
- Jack! Jack!</i>

779
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:39,950
- I see him!
- What?

780
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,369
- I see him!
- You do? Is he OK?

781
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:46,081
<i>He's all right! He's all right!</i>

782
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:49,542
Hold my legs. Hold my legs.
Somebody hold my legs.

783
01:17:49,543 --> 01:17:52,025
Hold his legs.

784
01:17:52,046 --> 01:17:54,627
<i>- Hold his legs!
- Come on!</i>

785
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:58,722
Come on! I got ya!

786
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:07,435
<i>- Is he hurt? Is he OK?
- Pull! Pull!</i>

787
01:18:07,436 --> 01:18:09,604
Come on! Come on!

788
01:18:09,605 --> 01:18:12,435
We got him now. Come on, pull!

789
01:18:13,108 --> 01:18:15,440
Jesus. I can't believe it.

790
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:20,846
You are a complete jerk. You know that?

791
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,526
- Did you have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.

792
01:18:27,414 --> 01:18:28,664
<i>Ortiz, thanks.</i>

793
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:32,337
How many lives you got, man?

794
01:18:32,377 --> 01:18:37,177
<i>You're not too bright, man,
but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.</i>

795
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:43,680
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

796
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:47,367
Can't even pay him a compliment.

797
01:18:47,977 --> 01:18:51,271
- How you doing?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

798
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:53,607
Other than that, I'm fine.

799
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:57,277
- What is that smell?
- It's gas.

800
01:18:57,278 --> 01:19:00,255
- We're leaking gas?
- We are now.

801
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,037
You felt you needed
another challenge or something?

802
01:19:07,038 --> 01:19:10,040
<i>- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.</i>

803
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:12,834
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us?
We're losing gas.

804
01:19:12,835 --> 01:19:17,635
- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.

805
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:22,636
Gotcha. Norwood, get a fuel car
out here on the double.

806
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:25,472
Is that gonna work?

807
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:28,450
I don't know.

808
01:19:31,145 --> 01:19:32,782
Harry, save my life.

809
01:21:05,823 --> 01:21:08,658
Harry, tell me good news, man.

810
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:12,034
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

811
01:21:13,914 --> 01:21:15,850
You fuck!

812
01:21:17,335 --> 01:21:21,671
It was the watch that led him
to me, wasn't it? Huh?

813
01:21:21,672 --> 01:21:26,301
It seemed a little hammy to me to build
the bomb out of my precious retirement gift,

814
01:21:26,302 --> 01:21:31,102
but, you know, I figured a sign that said
"Howard Payne" would be pushing it.

815
01:21:34,226 --> 01:21:37,479
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine out,
I swear to God.

816
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,482
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

817
01:21:40,483 --> 01:21:44,652
<i>Jack, we both know that he was the brains
of your particular operation.</i>

818
01:21:44,653 --> 01:21:47,655
You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.

819
01:21:47,656 --> 01:21:52,451
Otherwise, you, the wildcat
and every innocent person on that bus

820
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:55,927
are gonna end up just like your friend.

821
01:21:56,289 --> 01:22:01,004
Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?

822
01:22:01,711 --> 01:22:04,755
- Jack? Jack?
- Yeah.

823
01:22:04,756 --> 01:22:09,556
Good. You tell them that
the drop point is Pershing Square.

824
01:22:11,137 --> 01:22:14,265
There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner.

825
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:16,892
You drop the bags and leave.

826
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:20,368
<i>I don't show until all your people are gone.</i>

827
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:25,489
It's getting on to 11am, Jack, and I think
it's gonna be a very pretty day.

828
01:22:37,957 --> 01:22:41,793
<i>Jack.</i>

829
01:22:41,794 --> 01:22:46,423
Come on. Don't give up on me, Jack!
Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

830
01:22:46,424 --> 01:22:50,296
Stop it, OK? Don't give up
on me right now, all right?

831
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:57,064
We're really scared and we need you
right now. I can't do this by myself. Please?

832
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:00,209
Jack, please.

833
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:07,823
OK? Please. All right?

834
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:17,512
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, OK?

835
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,708
I'll be damned.

836
01:23:45,066 --> 01:23:48,610
Did you go to the University of Arizona?

837
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:51,440
- Yeah? So?
- Good football team.

838
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:54,824
Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know.

839
01:23:54,825 --> 01:23:57,010
Arizona Wildcats.

840
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:01,331
- Right.
- He can see you.

841
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:05,335
- What?
- He can see you.

842
01:24:05,336 --> 01:24:08,811
Just keep looking straight ahead.

843
01:24:23,938 --> 01:24:27,941
He called you a wildcat before.
Bastard's got a camera right in your face.

844
01:24:27,942 --> 01:24:31,236
He can see the whole bus.
He's been playing me from minute one.

845
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:35,699
- Well, he can see me, but can he hear me?
- Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.

846
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:40,500
<i>We are following the progress
of what is turning out to be a harrowing story,</i>

847
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:44,249
<i>as a city bus,
rigged to explode if it slows down,</i>

848
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:47,585
<i>races around literally in circles
at the Los Angeles airport.</i>

849
01:24:47,586 --> 01:24:52,386
<i>The dead are a female passenger and a driver
of another bus, both blown up by the bomber.</i>

850
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:57,350
<i>Others in jeopardy are the passengers of the
bus, held hostage at the whim of a madman.</i>

851
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:03,118
"The whim of a madman."

852
01:25:03,227 --> 01:25:04,964
I like that.

853
01:25:05,438 --> 01:25:08,815
There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder.

854
01:25:08,816 --> 01:25:11,900
I want you to stare straight ahead.

855
01:25:11,901 --> 01:25:16,122
Don't make any big movements, OK?

856
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:18,908
It's Jack.

857
01:25:18,909 --> 01:25:21,391
Yeah, I know about Harry.

858
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:25,823
Is that news van still around?

859
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:29,349
- Get those cameras to stop taping.
- Right.

860
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,256
LAPD. I need this unit.
You can broadcast UHF, right?

861
01:25:33,257 --> 01:25:36,801
There's a signal going to that bus.
I want you to find it.

862
01:25:36,802 --> 01:25:39,804
<i>We're gonna have to
take you off the air.</i>

863
01:25:39,805 --> 01:25:42,140
Please, sir, stop taping.

864
01:25:42,141 --> 01:25:46,062
Come on, hurry up. Good! Tape off of that.

865
01:25:49,023 --> 01:25:52,651
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

866
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:55,878
That ain't gonna be too hard.

867
01:26:06,749 --> 01:26:10,224
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it.
- It's taping!

868
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:21,596
- Jack.
- Yeah?

869
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:24,079
Look.

870
01:26:27,186 --> 01:26:30,605
- Mac, fuel.
- Jack, five minutes.

871
01:26:30,606 --> 01:26:33,483
Not enough time. Run the tape.
We have to unload.

872
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:36,236
<i>- I only have a minute of tape.
- Do it now.</i>

873
01:26:36,237 --> 01:26:40,803
I want you to make a tape and loop it
so that it runs over and over, OK?

874
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:47,710
- All right, run it. Run it!
- All right. Tape's rolling.

875
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:52,590
<i>We still have no live picture, but reports
are that the bus continues to circle...</i>

876
01:26:54,839 --> 01:26:58,299
<i>Everyone is safe for the moment.</i>

877
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,136
<i>Hard to imagine what's going
through their thoughts at this time.</i>

878
01:27:02,137 --> 01:27:04,916
<i>Certainly, a sense of community...</i>

879
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:26,529
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

880
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:31,124
All right, let's get 'em off.

881
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,557
OK, you, you, and you.

882
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:39,220
<i>Police have just issued a general
statement, which doesn't tell us much more...</i>

883
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:43,136
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

884
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:46,116
Come on. Look straight ahead.

885
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:08,204
- That's good, that's good.
- Grab my wrist.

886
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:10,885
Put your hand out. Take his hand.

887
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,054
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

888
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:28,430
<i>Give me your hand. Your hand.</i>

889
01:28:29,685 --> 01:28:33,060
<i>Grab my hand. Don't look down.</i>

890
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:37,650
Shit!

891
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:40,431
Jack!

892
01:28:41,862 --> 01:28:45,486
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

893
01:28:52,832 --> 01:28:55,611
Jack! Jack, I can't hold this any more.

894
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:57,669
Annie!

895
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,259
You... hold on!

896
01:29:02,883 --> 01:29:05,365
No! No! No!

897
01:29:07,263 --> 01:29:08,603
<i>Hold it.</i>

898
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:19,855
- Oh, God.
- Wedge down the gas pedal.

899
01:29:22,653 --> 01:29:25,135
OK, I got it.

900
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:38,517
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

901
01:29:46,802 --> 01:29:50,376
- OK, Annie, get on.
- Jack, I can't do this.

902
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:55,002
<i>- Let's go! Let's go!
- Shit. Shit.</i>

903
01:29:56,312 --> 01:29:58,198
- Jack.
- Shit!

904
01:29:59,482 --> 01:30:01,368
Hold on.

905
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:29,343
Shit!

906
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,951
Are you all right?

907
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,042
No.

908
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:44,914
It's OK. It's OK. It's over.

909
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:49,671
It's over. You did it. You did it.

910
01:31:53,972 --> 01:31:56,951
I hate the airport.

911
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:05,733
You're not gonna get mushy on me, are you?

912
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:09,754
Maybe. I might.

913
01:32:11,447 --> 01:32:16,159
I hope not, cos relationships that start
under intense circumstances never last.

914
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,031
- Oh, yeah?
- I've done extensive studying on this.

915
01:32:20,331 --> 01:32:22,763
Here comes the cavalry.

916
01:32:38,474 --> 01:32:41,453
- How ya doing?
- We're OK.

917
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:46,731
I just might be a nice guy
and let you have the rest of the day off.

918
01:32:46,732 --> 01:32:48,858
Oh, boy.

919
01:32:48,859 --> 01:32:51,695
Mac, this is Annie.

920
01:32:51,696 --> 01:32:54,948
Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon.

921
01:32:54,949 --> 01:32:57,367
- How you doing?
- OK.

922
01:32:57,368 --> 01:33:00,620
- This should take care of it.
- Ow!

923
01:33:00,621 --> 01:33:03,790
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

924
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:07,811
- We're gonna have you guys checked out.
- Lieutenant!

925
01:33:08,796 --> 01:33:11,715
It's him. He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money.

926
01:33:11,716 --> 01:33:14,760
I'll tell him what to do
with his goddamn money.

927
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:17,740
He doesn't know it blew up.

928
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:22,238
30 minutes.

929
01:34:02,141 --> 01:34:04,622
I'll be right back.

930
01:34:07,146 --> 01:34:11,946
All right, here's our target. Fox, I want you
in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3. Let's move it.

931
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:17,031
- Is the paint bomb in with the money?
- It's done, sir.

932
01:35:16,674 --> 01:35:20,149
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

933
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:24,703
OK.

934
01:35:25,891 --> 01:35:30,691
<i>We still have no live picture. Reports are
that the bus continues to circle inside LAX.</i>

935
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:43,523
No! No!

936
01:36:06,892 --> 01:36:10,019
Miss, you can't be this close.
You need to move back.

937
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,604
No. Jack Traven said...

938
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:16,405
Jack Traven asked that you be brought
out of harm's way. Just move right over here.

939
01:36:16,902 --> 01:36:20,624
- He's running a little late.
- He's not late.

940
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:24,492
- What?
- He's never late.

941
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:27,078
Well, that money hasn't moved.

942
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:31,879
We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog
in the bag. I'd say he's covered.

943
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:39,090
- Turn it on.
- What for? It hasn't moved.

944
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:41,572
Just do it.

945
01:36:48,558 --> 01:36:51,602
<i>Shit. It's moving.
He's got the money.</i>

946
01:36:51,603 --> 01:36:54,085
Jack!

947
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:05,179
Shit!

948
01:37:21,717 --> 01:37:23,926
Freeze!

949
01:37:23,927 --> 01:37:27,637
Pop quiz, asshole.
You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

950
01:37:27,638 --> 01:37:32,155
What do you do? What do you do?

951
01:37:32,768 --> 01:37:37,434
Turn around. Turn around!

952
01:37:55,499 --> 01:37:59,223
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

953
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,964
Be prepared.

954
01:38:02,965 --> 01:38:05,800
It's the Boy Scout marching song.

955
01:38:05,801 --> 01:38:10,263
What are you gonna do, Jack?
I don't think you can shoot her.

956
01:38:10,264 --> 01:38:11,753
Let her go.

957
01:38:12,975 --> 01:38:15,685
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

958
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:18,813
Fill it. Now.

959
01:38:22,318 --> 01:38:27,118
I think Harry would be very disappointed,
feeling that we're right back where we started.

960
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:31,534
Let her go. You don't need her.
You have the money. Take it and walk.

961
01:38:31,535 --> 01:38:35,122
Come on. Just take it and walk.
You don't need her.

962
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:38,501
- Just take your goddamn money and walk!
- Stay right there.

963
01:38:38,502 --> 01:38:41,754
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

964
01:38:41,755 --> 01:38:43,839
Oh, yeah.

965
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,640
You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh?
The beauty of it.

966
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:54,146
A bomb is made to explode.
That's its meaning, its purpose.

967
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:59,234
Your life is empty because you spend it
trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

968
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:03,464
And for who? For what?

969
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:08,030
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack,
that doesn't explode?

970
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:12,150
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

971
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:17,080
You're crazy. You're fucking crazy.

972
01:39:17,081 --> 01:39:20,333
No. Poor people are crazy, Jack.

973
01:39:20,334 --> 01:39:23,128
I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go.

974
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:25,839
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

975
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,216
You stay! Move it! Move it!

976
01:39:28,217 --> 01:39:31,196
In the door. In that door! Now!

977
01:39:32,638 --> 01:39:36,163
Bye, Jack. Punk.

978
01:39:39,645 --> 01:39:41,134
All right!

979
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:46,165
Get in there. Go on, get in.

980
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,785
You get back in there!
You get this train moving! Go on!

981
01:39:50,948 --> 01:39:53,743
Are these seats taken?

982
01:39:53,744 --> 01:39:55,331
No. Go.

983
01:39:58,206 --> 01:40:02,326
Come on. Back over here.
Hands around the pole.

984
01:40:22,773 --> 01:40:25,254
Damn.

985
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:45,627
Come on, come on, come on!

986
01:40:51,176 --> 01:40:54,998
<i>Please report, Westbound 501.
What is your position?</i>

987
01:40:59,267 --> 01:41:02,269
<i>Westbound 501, please check in.</i>

988
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:07,070
<i>Westbound 501. We have police orders
to return to the station. Do you copy?</i>

989
01:41:09,694 --> 01:41:14,240
You have to hold this. It's like a grenade.
You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

990
01:41:14,241 --> 01:41:17,910
Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you.

991
01:41:17,911 --> 01:41:19,412
<i>Do you copy?</i>

992
01:41:19,413 --> 01:41:22,340
Hey! I'll take it from here.

993
01:41:30,424 --> 01:41:33,843
<i>Uh-oh. Uh-oh.</i>

994
01:41:33,844 --> 01:41:38,347
Maybe you'd better let me have this after all.
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical

995
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:41,375
and you might let this go a mite early.

996
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:47,148
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

997
01:41:47,149 --> 01:41:49,650
It's not cos you're a woman, all right?

998
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:54,071
Hey, it's all right. Looks like we're all alone.

999
01:41:54,072 --> 01:41:58,872
You won. You beat Jack. You beat everybody.
Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

1000
01:41:59,703 --> 01:42:03,080
This stick works on a remote.

1001
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:07,418
When you explode, that's where they'll come,
but it's not where I'll be.

1002
01:42:07,419 --> 01:42:12,219
I have a different plan. Mess like that,
they don't even count body parts.

1003
01:42:13,508 --> 01:42:16,761
Gives me more time.

1004
01:42:16,762 --> 01:42:19,739
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1005
01:42:32,152 --> 01:42:35,131
Hey, Jack, is that you?

1006
01:42:36,782 --> 01:42:40,326
He's so persistent. He always gets his man.

1007
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:44,204
Wouldn't be able
to interest you in a bribe, would I?

1008
01:42:44,205 --> 01:42:48,424
I've got plenty to go around.

1009
01:42:51,796 --> 01:42:53,980
My money!

1010
01:42:58,678 --> 01:43:02,698
You bastard! How does that feel?

1011
01:43:03,975 --> 01:43:08,342
You like that, huh? You like it, you bastard?

1012
01:43:11,941 --> 01:43:14,273
My money!

1013
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,617
Shit!

1014
01:43:22,618 --> 01:43:26,489
You! I'm coming for you, Jack!

1015
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:59,333
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy. You want that?

1016
01:44:00,073 --> 01:44:02,825
I'm gonna get you.

1017
01:44:02,826 --> 01:44:04,365
Oh, yes!

1018
01:44:17,425 --> 01:44:21,762
What do you do, Jack? What do you do?
You're so smart, right, Jack?

1019
01:44:21,763 --> 01:44:26,563
You piece of shit! I'm the guy
with the plan cos I'm smarter than you.

1020
01:44:27,142 --> 01:44:29,623
I'm smarter than you.

1021
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:44,895
Yeah.

1022
01:44:46,078 --> 01:44:48,162
But I'm taller.

- Turn around.
- Where's Payne?

1027
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:04,336
He lost his head.

1028
01:45:05,264 --> 01:45:07,723
Oh, God.

1029
01:45:07,724 --> 01:45:12,440
- Let's take this off, shall we?
- Yes. Let's take this off.

1030
01:45:14,523 --> 01:45:18,097
<i>- Take it off.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:32,472
<i>Mac, I copy.</i>

1034

<i>- Mac.
- If someone can hear me...</i>

1035

<i>- Mac, can you hear me?
- Try the emergency brake. Do you copy?</i>

01:45:42,676 --> 01:45:46,053
Nothing works! Annie, you won't believe this.

What?

1038
01:45:48,265 --> 01:45:50,391
We have to jump.

1039
01:45:50,392 --> 01:45:52,873
You can't stop it?

1040
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:59,822
Well, OK, undo me,
and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

1041
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:03,529
- I don't have a key.
- What?

1042
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,012
I don't have the key.

1043
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:27,767
Shit.

1044
01:46:45,113 --> 01:46:48,032
You gotta get off... You gotta get off the train.

1045
01:46:48,033 --> 01:46:52,495
Jack, please! This track dead-ends.
You gotta get off this train. This is crazy.

1046
01:46:52,496 --> 01:46:54,789
There's a curve ahead.

1047
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:58,459
I'm gonna speed it up, make itjump the track.

1048
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:02,421
This is really stupid.
Jack, please. You can still jump.

1049
01:47:02,422 --> 01:47:06,144
Jack, please. Please, Jack?

1050
01:49:46,086 --> 01:49:50,756
I can't believe he hit my van.
Come on. It's all right.

1051
01:49:50,757 --> 01:49:51,947
Unreal.

1052
01:49:54,469 --> 01:49:56,762

OK.

1060
