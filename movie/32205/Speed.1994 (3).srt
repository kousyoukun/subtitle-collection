00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,288
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,891
Oh, hi. Yeah, I know.
They called me down here.

3
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:00,993
Some of this wiring
got screwed up.

4
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,995
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

5
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,996
Yeah. Just a second.

6
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,132
There you are.

it up. Good work, everybody.

- Marty, I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

- Congratulations.
- Good for you.

[Bell Dings]

17
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:53,442
Thanks for pushing that, Bob.
The light's on.

18
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,310
- But you never know.
It really might be broken.
- Shut up.

29
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,187
[Woman]
Peter! Come on!

30
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:47,383
Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other
elevators remain locked down and empty.

31
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,721
- Yes, sir.
- Now, there's no other way, no doors...

32
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:52,057
no other way in or out
except through access panels.

33
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:54,063
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,637
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

35
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:03,401
Bomb's already taken out cables.
Bomber wants $3 million, or he
blows the emergency brakes.

36
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:06,977
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

37
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:11,709
- That leaves 23 minutes exactly.
- Anything else that'll keep
this elevator from falling?

38
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,752
- The basement.
- The city would like to avoid
that event, Officer Traven.

39
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:18,789
- We can't just unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

40
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:21,085
The only way in or out
is through access panels.

41
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,525
The bomber's also wired
the hatch to trigger the bomb,

42
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:26,358
which seats him in the crazy
but not stupid section.

43
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,990
Sir, Harry volunteers
to examine the device.

44
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, right.

45
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:33,765
Fine. The two of you
check it out.

46
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,932
[Man] The nearest access
panel's on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

47
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,974
I want reports only.
We're in a holding pattern.

48
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,012
Worthy and Briggs, I want you to secure
the base area. No one in or out.

49
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,639
Everyone else, I want you
to affirm building evac. Move!

50
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:47,684
Looks like we're walkin'.

51
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,278
- [Man]
Hurry, folks, but watch your step.
- Twenty-nine!

52
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:54,221

Who's up there?

66
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,162
Who's up there?
What's going on?

67
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:45,226
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the L.A.P.D.

68
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,329
- Thank God!
- What are you doing up there?

69
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:52,877
[Traven] There has been an elevator
malfunction, so just relax.

70
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:56,880
[Man] Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?

71
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,314
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

72
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:01,316
Am I lying?

73
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,612
How come they sent
cops here?

74
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,952
Shouldn't they send
repair guys?

75
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:10,118
- [Woman] Yeah.
- [Man] Doesn't make any sense.

76
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,562
What do you think?

77
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:22,201
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

78
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:27,040
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognize the work,
but he's a pro.

79
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,510
Oh, he's cuttin' it close.

80
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,513
I don't like it.

81
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,517
Yeah, well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

82
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:47,265
All right, pop quiz.
The airport.

83
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,765
Gunman with one hostage.
He's usin' her for cover.

84
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:54,498
He's almost to a plane.
You're a hundred feet away.

85
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:02,007
Jack.

86
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:04,046
Shoot the hostage.

87
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:06,048
What?

88
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,119
Take her
out of the equation.

89
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,450
Go for the good wound, and
he can't get to the plane with her.

90
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,252
- Clear shot.
- You're deeply nuts. You know that?

91
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,260
"Shoot the hostage."
Geez.

92
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:23,859
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

93
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,834
Why?

94
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:28,030
I don't know.
Gut feeling.

95
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:31,336
Well, right now Mac
outranks your gut, so we sit.

96
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,978
This is taking way too long.

97
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:38,212
How much you think
that elevator weighs?

98
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,545
Jack, come on.

99
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,719
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

100
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,788
We're not gonna
shoot 'em, right?

101
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,489
[Man] Hey, where are you going?
What's going on?

102
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:59,035
[Woman]
Don't go! Don't leave us here!

103
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,184
No, we just take them
out of the equation.

104
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:51,446
- You sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

105
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:54,859
Six minutes.

106
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,986
I can't get any more time.
He's not talkin'!

107
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,622
I need
the goddamn money now!

108
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,845
Tell me again, Harry.
Why did I take this job?

109
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,383
Aw, come on. Thirty more years
of this, you get a tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.

110
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:22,816

114

- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

- [Woman] There's one more.
Can you get her out?

Come on.
Come on, let's go!

- No. No, I can't!
- It's going to fall.

Just take one step,
reach out and take my hand.

00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:58,238
Once the bus goes 50 miles
an hour, the bomb is armed.

308
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:02,580
If it drops below 50,
it blows up.

What do you do?
What do you do!

You think I'm
gonna tell you that?

There are rules, Jack, and
I want you to get this right.

314
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:20,030
No one goes off the bus.

315
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:24,267
You try to take any passengers
off the bus, I will detonate it.

- We can't pull that
kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

318
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:36,219
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call.

319
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:41,621
The radio's down.
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.

320

It's running downtown
from Venice.

321

of Ocean Park and Main.

hours just to get here from the airport.

And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

You should be glad.

She was scared. She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed.

it would 've killed us all.

do it by then, I can't do it at all.

- [Harry Over Radio]
Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

What is he doing?
Oh, my God, he is insane.

906
01:13:02,631 --> 01:13:06,465
Okay, Jack, this is it.
Don't get dead.

907
01:13:20,549 --> 01:13:23,347
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

Oh, Christ.

909
01:13:35,163 --> 01:13:37,188
Just keep it steady.

Oh, thank you for
the tip, Ortiz.

- Gosh darn.

912
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:57,710
We're gonna have to try to bypass
the remote current with the battery.

913
01:13:57,853 --> 01:13:59,844
Can you find the trip
wire for the remote?

914
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:02,422
I don't know.
I got a few choices here.

915
01:14:02,557 --> 01:14:05,390
- Black and red?
- And green.

916
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,929
Okay. All right. I'm gonna
guess he's not gonna go with
standard copper for the remote.

917
01:14:10,031 --> 01:14:12,295
That'd be too weak.
I'd use a fiber alloy.

918
01:14:12,434 --> 01:14:15,494
Jack, I'm gonna need
you to look at the wire.

- Harry, it's covered.
- Yeah, I know.

920
01:14:20,242 --> 01:14:23,040
You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

01:14:23,178 --> 01:14:25,043
Right.

- Great. Okay, I want you
to clip on the battery...

925
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,407
- and then run it to the lead wire.
- Copy.
