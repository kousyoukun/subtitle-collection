Uh, very quick on the uptake.

It can't be as difficult
as all that.

NARRATOR: And, so it
was agreed, and straightaway,

193
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:15,306
that contrite Mole was eager to
learn from his wise, new friend,

194
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,577
not only about the perils
and dangers of the River

195
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:22,643
and its weirs and its sudden
floods, but also about its joys:

196
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,655
Night fishing with Otter,

197
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,283
excursions far afield
with Badger,

198
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:29,884
these things and so much more.

199
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:32,896
Until the glowing tiredness of
the long day...

200
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,024
finally overcame him, and
it was time for him to lay...

201

his happy head on the pillow,

202

knowing his other new friend,
the River,

203
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:43,063
was lapping close to his window.

204
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:46,565
And as summer ripened
and he mastered the skills...

205
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,771
and learned the delights
of running water,

206
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:52,271
he caught something of what
the wind was whispering...

207
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,682
so constantly in the reeds.

a very nice animal.

So simple, so good... natured.

So affectionate.

Not very clever, perhaps,

212
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:15,471
and it may be that he's both
boastful and conceited.

213

But, uh, he's got some great
qualities, has Toady.

he's taken up instead.

take Toad seriously in hand,

who ought to be washerwomen.

964
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:30,300
WOMAN: Do be quiet.
You do hurt my head.

965
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:34,207
It's my aunt as does the washing
for the prisoners, see,

966
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:36,176
because my father, the jailer,

967
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:38,736
do like to keep any
paying business in the family.

968
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,682
Now, my aunt is very poor,

969
00:49:42,718 --> 00:49:49,089
and if you, Mr. Toad, don't want
to stay here for 20 years...

970
00:49:49,124 --> 00:49:51,354
and would come
to an arrangement...

971
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:53,020
TOAD: To be free?

972
00:49:53,061 --> 00:49:55,689
WOMAN: When her comes directly,
her could...

973
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:58,359
just slip her clothes off,
and you could put hers on,

974
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,197
and then everything
will be all right, you see...

975
00:50:00,235 --> 00:50:01,964
because we could get you out.

976
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:12,544
RAT: Hello, old friend.
Had a nice day?

977
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,311
Phew! Hasn't it been hot?

978
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,215
MOLE: Hmm.

979
00:50:17,252 --> 00:50:20,085
Been on the River
with some pals.

980
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:23,182
How was your supper
with the otters?

981
00:50:23,225 --> 00:50:25,750
RAT: Something's the matter.
Out with it.

982
00:50:27,462 --> 00:50:30,693
MOLE: I've been worrying
about Toad,

983
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:34,031
wondering how he'll stick
being in prison.

984
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:37,232
RAT: Never mind Toad.
He always falls on his feet.

985
00:50:37,272 --> 00:50:40,139
MOLE: Ratty, how could you?

986
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:42,006
RAT: Save your concern
for the otters.

987
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:43,978
Young Portly has been missing
for several days.

988
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:47,140
He's strayed before,
but never for so long,

989
00:50:47,182 --> 00:50:48,444
and the river's swollen.

990
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,417
MOLE: And the lad's
no great swimmer yet.

991
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:52,647
The Weir. Suppose...

992
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,247
RAT: Quite.
His father's frantic.

993
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,224
He's going to keep watch
all night by the ford.

994
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:59,250
It's where he caught
his first fish, you see?

995
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:07,665
[Indistinct voices]

996
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:14,339
Do you mind?

[Clears throat]

998
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:21,948
Ha ha ha ha!

999

Toad, old boy, you are a marvel!

[Train whistle]

1001
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:28,684
Huh? Oh!

1002
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,758
Aah!

1003
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:42,599
Oh, no! My wallet!

1004
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:46,073
It's in my other clothes. Aah!
I haven't got any money!

1005
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:49,508
Oh, oh! Oh, no!

1006
00:51:49,544 --> 00:51:50,909
Wait! Wait! Don't go!

1007

TOAD: Uh... oh, sir!

1008
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:55,549
Oh, sir!

1009
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:58,178
Look, I'm a poor,
unhappy washerwoman,

1010
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,586
and I've lost all my money,
and I can't pay for a ticket,

1011
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:02,419
and I must get home tonight.

1012
00:52:02,457 --> 00:52:05,255
MAN: And got some nippers
a... waiting for you, daresay.

1013

TOAD: Oh, yes.
Any amount of them.

1014

Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

1015
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,064
MAN: I'll tell you what.

1016
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,159
You wash a few shirts for me,
I'll give you a ride.

1017
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:17,000
TOAD: Yes, yes!
A thousand shirts!

1018
00:52:17,038 --> 00:52:18,972
MAN: Up with you, then!

1019
00:52:19,007 --> 00:52:20,497
TOAD: Whoa!

1020
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:26,470
TOAD, THINKING:
Ah, admit it, Toad, old boy...

1021
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:29,075
you are a marvel!

1022
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:30,414
Luck?

1023
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:32,386
Luck doesn't come into it.

1024
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,944
Oh, with what brilliant
theatrical skill...

1025
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,456
you bamboozled
the prison guards!

1026
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,958
With what subtle arts
of persuasion...

1027
00:52:37,993 --> 00:52:40,518
you wrung the heart
of this clod of a train driver.

1028
00:52:40,562 --> 00:52:43,258
Why, you're probably
the greatest actor in England,

1029
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:47,496
and you're once again free,
my dear fellow. Free!

MAN: Here's a run... go,
washerwoman.

1031
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:52,163
Criminals, are we?

1032
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:53,640
Then we ought to stop.

1033
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:55,233
TOAD: No! I will confess.

1034
00:52:55,277 --> 00:52:58,337
I am not a poor washerwoman,
but rather the famous Mr. Toad.

1035
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,348
I've just escaped
from a loathsome jail,

1036
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:02,282
and if they recapture me,

1037
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:04,649
it will be chains and misery
once again...

1038
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:06,278
for poor, innocent me.

1039
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:09,449
MAN: Innocent?
What were you imprisoned for?

1040
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:11,152
TOAD: Only borrowing a car.

to turn you in,

00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:17,794
but I don't hold with being
ordered about by policemen...

1044
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:19,823
when I'm on me own engine.

1045

Here's the tunnel a... comin'.

1046
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:25,029
You must jump just before,
all right?

1047
00:53:25,073 --> 00:53:26,472
TOAD: Yes.

1048

Now! Jump!

NARRATOR:
So Toad was safe for the moment,

1053
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:40,984
but what of little Portly,

1054
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:42,990
missed, looked for,
not yet found,

1055
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:45,925
and leaving no clues
to help the searchers?

1056
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,929
Ah, Ratty, dear old Ratty,

1057
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:51,455
who was so wise
in the ways of the River,

1058
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:53,990
was following
an instinct of his own,

1059
00:53:54,035 --> 00:53:56,503
something that was in the air.

1060
00:53:56,538 --> 00:54:01,999
Some spirit drew him on...
haunting, awesome...

1061
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:05,945
and once he heard its voice,
he had no option but to follow.

1062
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:08,074
Sometimes the beauty of it
hurt him.

1063
00:54:08,116 --> 00:54:12,610
It would come and go... faint
an hour, and then stronger...

1064
00:54:12,654 --> 00:54:15,248
which was nowhere,
and yet everywhere at once...

1065
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,520
a merry bubble and joy,

1066
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,687
or else a thin, clear,
happy call...

1067
00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:24,187
that he had once heard
at its loudest and strongest...

1068
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:28,100
at the place of what
he called his song... dream:

1069
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:31,867
A holy place where,
if anywhere at all,

1070
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,874
that spirit might be found.

1071
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:37,537
MOLE: Ratty, are you afraid?

1072
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,069
RAT: Of him?

1073
00:54:39,114 --> 00:54:41,480
Never. Never.

1074
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:05,529

creature... has been here.

Where did you get to?

for two nights because of you?

beautiful has happened, Mole.

WEASEL: I should like
to say one word...

1278
01:04:33,274 --> 01:04:35,799
about our kind host, Mr. Toad.

1279
01:04:35,843 --> 01:04:38,277
We all know Toad!

Yeah. Good Toad!

You and old Ratty go outside...

BADGER: Sit down, Toad!

1309

Shortly, you will attend
to our immediate needs,

1310
01:06:04,398 --> 01:06:06,798
and tomorrow you will give
a splendid banquet...

Some stood fast for a bit.

And there were stoats
fighting with weasels,

1320
01:06:30,257 --> 01:06:31,815
and they was wrestling
and wriggling.

There'll be other speeches
by him later in the evening.

1327
01:06:45,439 --> 01:06:48,408
Then an address by Toad
about, uh...

1328
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:50,842
the prison system, canals,
horse stealing, et cetera,

1329
01:06:50,878 --> 01:06:53,244
followed by a song from Toad...

1330
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,239
and other pieces
performed by the composer, Toad,

1331

uh... oh...

1332
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:03,245

What's keeping him?

1336
01:07:19,807 --> 01:07:24,369
BADGER: Always in the habit
of keeping people waiting.

1337
01:07:24,412 --> 01:07:26,243
TOAD: Not one song. Huh!

1338
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,215
Whose homecoming is it,
I'd like to know?

When the Toad came home

1340
01:07:37,124 --> 01:07:41,823
When the Toad came home

1341

There was smashing in
of window

1342
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,768
And crashing in of door

1343

are saluting

Don't want my songs, eh?

1355
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:28,308
Well, it's entirely their loss,
of course.

try and shout it very loud

cheered when he entered,

and crowded round to praise his
great courage and cleverness.

1366
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,961
But Toad only smiled,
"Thank you,"

1367
01:09:22,997 --> 01:09:27,832
and murmured, "Not at all.
Badger was the mastermind,

four friends would take a stroll
together in the Wild Wood.

their young ones...

Whenever their children
were naughty,

01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:43,205
they would be told
if they didn't behave,

01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:46,975

would up and get them!

GIRL: But this
was very unfair on Badger...

1396

rather fond of children.

this happens,

Oh, blow! Hang spring... cleaning!

RAT: I'm not always talking
about my old river,

1405
01:11:14,141 --> 01:11:16,109
but I think about it
all the time.

I got out, of course.
