10
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,001
Oh, no.

11
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,801
Now then...

12
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:17,641
Oh.

13
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,081
Bother.

14
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,561
Oh.

15
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:09,601
Eugh!

16
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,081
Oh, dear.

17
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,881
That's better.

18
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:47,201
Bother and blow!

19
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,521
<i>- So much to do.</i>

20
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,321
Oh, hang spring-cleaning!

21
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,161
Oh, my! Oh, my!

22
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,481
Ah.

23
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,441
Oh!

24
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,761
Oh.

25
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,321
Hello.

26
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,601
- Rat?
- Hello, Mole!

27
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:06,721
Didn't think you chaps
ever came out in the sunlight.

28
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:09,521
Why don't you come over?

29
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,441
Oh, it's all very well to talk.

30
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,121
Ah, yes.

31
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,961
<i>- A boat.
- That's right.</i>

32
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:29,161
<i>Hang on to that.</i>

33
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,121
Thank you.

34
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,201
<i>Come on, step lively.</i>

35
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,441
Ooh...

36
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:39,521
I've... ne-never been in a boat.

37
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,601
<i>Never been in a...</i>

38
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,361
Well, I...
What have you been doing all your life?

39
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,721
L-Is it... so nice?

40
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,881
Nice?  It's the only thing.

41
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,521
Believe me, there is nothing,

42
00:07:54,601 --> 00:08:00,281
absolutely nothing half so much worth
doing as simply messing about in boats.

43
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,561
Messing about, er, in boats.

44
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,201
Simply messing.

45
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,481
<i>- Look out, Rat!
- Oh!</i>

46
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,921
<i>Ooh'.!</i>

47
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,641
Are... Are you alright?

48
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,521
Yes. Messing about in boats.

49
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:27,601
Or with boats.
In or out of them, it doesn't matter.

50
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,241
Look here, if you've nothing else
on hand this afternoon,

51
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,721
would you care to go for
a row down the river?

52
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:36,961
Care to?

53
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,001
We might have a picnic.

54
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,681
<i>Shove that down there.</i>

55
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,881
<i>- Y-Your house?
- That's right.</i>

56
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,601
<i>Oh, my.</i>

57
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,441
So, this is a river.

58
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,001
<i>The river.</i>

59
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,401
You really live by the river?

60
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:29,521
<i>By it and with it
and on it and in it.</i>

61
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,241
It's brother and sister to me,

62
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,401
and aunts and company and food and drink

63
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,361
and, naturally, washing.

64
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,681
It's my world
and I don't want any other.

65
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,641
What it hasn't got isn't worth having

66
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,481
and what it doesn't know
isn't worth knowing.

67
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:49,601
Lord, the times we've had together,
whether in winter or summer,

68
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:54,641
spring or autumn, it's always got
its fun and its excitements.

69
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,601
<i>What do you say we moor here
and have our picnic?</i>

70
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,241
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

71
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:16,761
<i>Now, what have we here?</i>

72
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:19,961
There's cold chicken, cold tongue,
cold ham, cold beef.

73
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,801
Pickled gherkin salad, French rolls,
mustard and cress,

74
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,441
- potted meat, ginger beer, lemonade...
- Stop, stop, this is too much!

75
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,921
Too much? Oh, do you really think so?

76
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:32,801
It's only what I usually take
on these little excursions,

77
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,401
and Toad always tells me that I'm
a mean beast and cut things very fine.

78
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:38,481
Now, pitch in, old fellow.

79
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,041
<i>Oh, my.</i>

80
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,361
<i>My, oh, my!</i>

81
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,921
Hmm.

82
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,281
Beautiful.

83
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,401
<i>Mmm...</i>

84
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,121
I say. There's old Badger.

85
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,041
Badger!

86
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,081
Badger, old chap! Come and join us.

87
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,521
Company.

88
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,401
Yes, that's just the sort of fellow
he is.

89
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:52,801
Simply hates society.
He'll be off home now.

90
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,561
Where does he live?

91
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,481
- In the Wild Wood.
- Oh.

92
00:11:57,561 --> 00:12:01,001
<i>We don't go there very much,
we river people.</i>

93
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,121
Is there something wrong with it?

94
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:08,521
Er, well, not wrong exactly.

95
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,841
The squirrels are alright and the
hedgehogs and some of the rabbits.

96
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:16,041
And of course, no one interferes
with Badger. They'd better not.

97
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:18,681
Why? Wh-Who should interfere with him?

98
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,361
Well, there are others,
stoats and weasels.

99
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,121
Hello there, Mr Rat.

100
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,521
Having a picnic with your friend?

101
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,801
- Ooh, very nice.
- Leave that alone.

102
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,001
Very nice.

103
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:41,361
You ought to visit us Wild Wooders
one day, sir.

104
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,601
You don't wanna believe
everything people say about us.

105
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,241
Afternoon, gentlemen.

106
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,041
They don't seem too bad.

107
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:00,281
Well, they're alright in a way, but...

108
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,161
Well, I never go to the Wild Wood

109
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,121
and you won't either
if you've got any sense.

110
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,201
Hello...

111
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:08,881
<i>Where is the potted meat?</i>

112
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:14,881
I couldn't eat another bite.

113
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,721
Well, I suppose I really ought
to pack the basket.

114
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,401
Oh, do let me.

115
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:24,561
My dear fellow, please do
if you'd really like to.

116
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,001
Oh.

117
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,201
Oh... Oh, bother.

118
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,081
Don't worry about that, old chap.

119
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:49,241
Oh, what a splendid time
we're having.

120
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:53,401
Look here, why don't you come
and stay with me for a few days?

121
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:56,201
I live in a very plain and simple way.

122
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:58,801
My home is nothing like Toad Hall.

123
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,561
Toad Hall?

124
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,881
Oh, of course.
You haven't met Toad yet, have you?

125
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,561
Why don't we drop down the river
and call on him?

126
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:10,801
I... I suppose...
I couldn't row, could I?

127
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:14,281
Bother! Oh, bother.

128
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,641
Both oars together, old chap,
if you can manage it.

129
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,161
Oh, yes, Rat.

130
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:27,361
<i>A“ We are down a-dabbling,
up tails all</i>

131
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:39,401
<i>A“ We are down a-dabbling,
up tails all</i>

132
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,001
<i>There's Toad Hall.</i>

133
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,121
My goodness.

134
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:51,641
You're sure it's alright to
call on Mr Toad unannounced?

135
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,401
Oh, certainly.

136
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,841
It's never the wrong time
to call on Toad.

137
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:06,321
<i>Yes, dear old Toad.
He always has some new craze, you know.</i>

138
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,041
I managed to get him
interested in sculling.

139
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:12,601
He's not much good at it,
but it keeps him out of mischief.

140
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:17,241
He's the best of animals really.
So good natured and affectionate.

141
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:20,521
Perhaps he's not very clever,
but we can't all be geniuses,

142
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,681
and he may be rather boastful
and conceited,

143
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,521
but he has some great qualities,
has Toady.

144
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:29,521
And Toad Hall is one of
the finest houses in these parts.

145
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,561
Though, of course,
we never say so to Toad.

146
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:36,961
<i>- Ah-ha!
- Hello, Toad. This is Mole.</i>

147
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,321
Oh! Hello, Mole.

148
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:42,241
Hooray! This is splendid.

149
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,841
Ratty, you're just the chap
I wanted to see.

150
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,641
Having trouble with your boating?

151
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:50,281
Oh, poo! Boating?
I've given that up long ago.

152
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,001
I've discovered the real thing.

153
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:56,081
The only genuine occupation
of a lifetime.

154
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,601
Ooh-hoe! Come and see.

155
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,601
Come along, come along.
Just over here.

156
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,401
There you are.

157
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,921
The open road,
the dusty highway.

158
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:14,321
Here today and up and off
to somewhere else tomorrow.

159
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,241
Travel, change, excitement.

160
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:18,441
Oh, no.

161
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:23,081
Mind you, this is the finest cart
ever built, without any exception.

162
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,281
<i>Designed it myself.</i>

163
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:28,401
All complete.
Nothing whatever forgotten.

164
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:33,681
And so you'll find when we all set out
on our first expedition this afternoon.

165
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,921
We? This afternoon?

166
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,681
I'm not going and that's flat.

167
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:40,441
And Mole will do as I do,
won't you, Mole?

168
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,761
Of course I will, Rat.

169
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:45,001
All the same, it sounds as if
it might have been...

170
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,401
...well, rather fun, you know?

171
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:19,401
<i>A“ Rambling where you please
on the open road</i>

172
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,321
<i>4' On the open road</i>

173
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:55,801
<i>I Though you're far from home
on the open road</i>

174
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:04,961
<i>I Wandering the lanes together</i>

175
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,841
<i>A“ Through the hills
and trees and heather</i>

176
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:11,881
<i>4' On the open road</i>

177
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,401
This is the life.

178
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,921
Talk about your old river.

179
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,641
I don't talk about my river.

180
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:48,681
I think about it.
I think about it all the time.

181
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:50,921
- Ratty.
- Hmm?

182
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:55,161
It's all my fault. Let's go home.

183
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:58,921
No, Moley, we'll see it out.

184
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:03,681
Thanks all the same,
but we must stick by old Toad.

185
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,601
<i>A“ So we sing our song on the open road</i>

186
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,281
<i>A“ Come on, Alfred, join the chorus</i>

187

<i>4' On the open road</i>

188
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:59,961
I say, you fellows,
this is the only way to travel.

189
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,681
<i>Eh?</i>

190
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,401
Ugh!

191
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:22,241
Steady on, Alfred.

192
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,521
No harm done.

193
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:25,841
- Villains!
- Whoa!

194
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,801
- Scoundrels!
- Whoa!

195
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,481
- Highwaymen!
- Steady, Alfred.

196
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:33,241
- Road hogs!
- Steady... Steady.

197
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,641
<i>Poop, poop-</i>

198
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:40,321
<i>Toad, old chap. Are you alright?</i>

199
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,201
The poetry of motion.

200
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,121
Toad, Alfred's not hurt.

201
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,921
And I'm sure we can
get the caravan mended and...

202
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,081
Caravan? Poo!

203
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:55,401
Nasty, common, canary-coloured cart.

204
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:58,841
That is the only way to travel.
Ooh-hoo!

205
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:03,081
Here today, in next week tomorrow!
Poop,poop!

206
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,841
- Now, Toad...
- Poop,poop!Poop,poop!

207
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:07,281
Poop,poop!Poop,poop!

208
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,321
Whoo!

209
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,681
<i>Poop. poop!</i>

210
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,881
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Hey-hey-hey!

211
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,921
Poop,poop!Poop,poop!

212
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:28,761
Toot, toot!

213
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,721
<i>Poop, poop!</i>

214
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,961
Hello, you fellows!

215
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,721
Oh, no.

216
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,281
Poop. Poop.

217
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,081
Are you alright, Mr Toad?

218
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,881
Ooh, you want to watch out.

219
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:09,321
You'll be had up for dangerous driving
one of these days.

220
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,921
Poop,poop!

221
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,201
Wahey-hey-hey!

222
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:24,841
Oops! Oh.

223
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,641
Wahey-hey-hey!

224
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,121
Poop,poop!

225
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:35,001
POOP!

226
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,161
<i>Poop. poop'-!</i>

227
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:47,921
<i>Poop, poop!</i>

228
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:51,241
<i>Whoops.</i>

229
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,601
Wahey! Hello!

230
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,321
Poop, poop, poop!

231
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,721
Poop,poop!

232
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:10,001
Poop,poop,poop!Poop,poop!

233
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,681
<i>Poop...</i>

234
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,841
Poop. Poop.

235
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,801
POOP--'...

236
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,041
I really am worried about Toad.

237
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:27,641
Oh, it's only another of his passions.
He'll grow out of it.

238
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:29,641
Poop, poop!

239
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,361
I hope.

240
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:35,241
Come on!

241
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,121
Oh...

242
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,641
Oh, dear. Ooh!

243
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,521
Poop, poop!
Poop,poop!

244
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,681
He's going very fast.

245
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,641
It's Mr Toad!

246
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,681
Mr Toad, look out!

247
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:03,121
<i>- Look out'.</i>

248
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,721
He'll kill himself one day.

249
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,321
Are you alright, Mr Toad?

250
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:23,641
Poop, poop!

251
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,161
We really must do something about Toad.

252
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,881
Oh, yes. Erm... what shall we do?

253
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:06,361
Well, there's only one person Toad
would take notice of and that's Badger.

254
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:10,241
- We must go and see him.
- Oh, yes. N... Now?

255
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,921
Hmm?

256
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,801
No, no, it's...
It's too late now.

257
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,401
Looks as though it might snow.

258
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:23,321
Besides, Badger lives in the middle of
the Wild Wood, underground.

259
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,321
Not our sort of place at all.

260
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,921
But I...

261
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:31,961
It sounds just like my... sort of place.

262
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,281
Hmm...

263
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,601
Is this the way to
Mr Badger's house?

264
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:23,361
Oh, it is, sir. it is.

265
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:27,361
It's straight on. You can't miss it.

266
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:30,881
Thank you.

267
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:35,081
Oh...

268
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,401
<i>Stow.!</i>

269
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:42,721
Ratty!

270
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,801
Moley?

271
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:03,881
"Ratty, have gone to see Mr Badger
in the Wild Wood, Moley."

272
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,841
Oh, my goodness!

273
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:23,401
- Er...
- Out of my way.

274
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:34,921
Mole!

275
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,401
Moley!

276
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:46,841
Oh, Moley.

277
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,801
Mole?

278
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,321
Mole?

279
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,321
Mole, it's me!

280
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:14,961
It's old Rat.

281
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,321
Ratty.

282
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:25,841
- Moley.
- Is it really you?

283
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:30,201
<i>- Are you alright?
- Oh, Rat, I've been so frightened.</i>

284
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,961
It's alright, old fellow.

285
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,761
But you really shouldn't
have come to the Wild Wood.

286
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:38,521
I did try to warn you.

287
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,441
Hmm... We must get home.

288
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,121
The trouble is, everything looks
so different in the snow.

289
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:51,561
Ratty, I'm so sorry, but...
I don't think I can walk any further.

290
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,881
Now, you must try, old chap.

291
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:57,841
The path's up there somewhere. Come on.

292
00:32:57,921 --> 00:33:00,321
<i>Ow! Oh!</i>

293
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:01,681
<i>What happened?</i>

294
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:03,921
I fell over that door scraper.

295
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:06,561
Door scraper? That's funny.

296
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:08,481
It didn't feel funny.

297
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,641
<i>Mole! Here's a doormat.</i>

298
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:14,481
A doormat?

299
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:18,281
Help... Help... Help me clear this away.
It's our last chance.

300
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:22,961
Oh...

301
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:24,881
Ratty!

302
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:28,521
You're so clever.

303
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:36,721
Now, the very next time this
happens I shall be exceedingly angry.

304
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:41,081
Who is it this time
disturbing people on such a night?

305
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:43,521
Speak up.

306
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,921
<i>Oh, Badger.
It's me, Rat, and my friend, Mole.</i>

307
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,881
Do let us in, please.

308
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:51,881
Oh... Why, Ratty, my dear little man.

309
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,841
Come along in, both of you, at once.

310
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:56,561
You must be perished.

311
00:33:56,641 --> 00:34:00,321
Well, I never, and in the Wild Wood,
too, at this time of night.

312
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:02,721
Come in with you, come in.

313
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,281
Come along, Ratty.

314
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:28,041
There's a good fire in the kitchen.
I'll get you both a nice hot drink.

315
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,521
Lovely to be underground again.

316
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,801
When you're underground,
nothing can get at you.

317
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:41,321
That's exactly what I say.

318
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:46,281
Look at Rat now, couple of feet of
floodwater and he has to move.

319
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,841
Or Toad Hall...

320
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:54,721
Oh, it's very splendid, I dare say,
but it's all draughty.

321
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,601
No, no,
underground is my idea of home.

322
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:04,521
Now then, what's the news
from your part of the world?

323
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,841
How's young Toad?

324
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:11,041
<i>Oh, he's going from bad to worse.
Another smash up only last week.</i>

325
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,801
How many has he had?

326
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:18,281
Smashes or cars? Oh, well,
it's the same thing with Toad.

327
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:21,121
<i>- This is his seventh, Ratty, isn't it?
- Yes.</i>

328
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,841
Irresponsible animal.

329
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,841
<i>He's a hopelessly bad driver
with no thought for law and order.</i>

330
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:31,841
He'll kill someone... sooner or later.

331
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,561
When I was his age,

332
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:38,601
we didn't rush around the countryside
frightening people.

333
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,001
We had better things to do
with our time.

334
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,841
Oh!

335
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:46,801
Ah, cricketer, are you?
Good, good.

336
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:53,161
Now... About Toad.

337
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,401
<i>Ah, yes, erm, we are his friends,
Badger.</i>

338
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:02,081
We really ought to do something.
He's giving us animals a bad name.

339
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:07,921
You are entirely correct.

340
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,921
Moreover, his father was a friend
of mine, most respectable Toad.

341
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:17,121
Ah... What do you think
we should do, Mr Badger?

342
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:22,681
I think that you and I,
and our friend here...

343
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:27,881
...should take Toad
seriously in hand.

344
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,881
We'll stand no nonsense whatever.

345
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:34,081
We will bring him back to reason,
by force if necessary.

346
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:37,841
<i>- The hour has struck.</i>

347
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,321
Do you agree, lad?

348
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:45,201
Er, hmm? Oh, absolutely, yes.
I-I-I quite agree, definitely.

349
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:46,281
No question.

350
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:49,241
First thing in the morning...

351
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:54,801
...we will pay a call on Toad.

352
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,441
Ah-ha! Hello, you fellows!

353
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:10,241
You're just in time
to come for a jolly spin in my new...

354
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,761
...in... in my new...

355
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:17,801
You will not be needing that... machine.

356
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:22,601
- I shall send it back.
- Wha... I say! I...

357
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:24,761
And, Toad...

358
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:30,841
You will give us your solemn promise
never to touch a motor car again.

359
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,281
Shan't!

360
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:36,281
Inside! Take him to the library!

361
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:40,601
And I will try what argument can do.

362
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,521
<i>- Ow...
- It's for your own good, Toad.</i>

363
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:45,521
I'm sorry, Toad,
but really it is.

364
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:48,161
<i>- Mole, do catch hold of...
- Ow!</i>

365
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:51,441
I say, stop it! What are you...?

366
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:55,601
I say, you chaps!

367
00:37:55,681 --> 00:38:01,561
We will see whether you come out of that
room the same Toad that you went in.

368
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:04,001
Let go! Ow!

369
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,961
You... cads!

370
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,401
<i>Let go! Ouch!</i>

371
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:15,041
You knew it must come to this
sooner or later, Toad.

372
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:19,441
You've disregarded
all the warnings we've given you.

373
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:24,121
You've gone on squandering the money
your father left you

374
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,961
and you're getting us animals
a bad name in the district

375
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:32,001
by your frivolous driving and your
smashes and your rows with the police.

376
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:36,321
Independence is all very well,

377
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:40,881
but we animals never allow our friends
to make fools of themselves

378
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,241
beyond a certain limit,
and that limit you've reached.

379
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,481
Oh, you're so right, Badger.

380
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:49,121
You're a good fellow,
in many respects...

381
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,121
- Oh, true.
- I don't want to be too hard on you.

382
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:57,201
I'll make one more effort
to bring you to reason.

383
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:00,561
Oh, I am indeed a foolish Toad.

384
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:07,161
No, never again. Never ever again!

385
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,401
My friends...

386
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:18,001
I am pleased to inform you that Toad
has seen the error of his ways.

387
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:24,761
He is truly sorry for what he has done
and perceives the folly of it all.

388
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:27,281
That is good news.

389
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,681
Do you, Toad? Do you really?

390
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:35,481
No!  I'm not sorry at all!

391
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,921
And it wasn't folly,
it was simply glorious!

392
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:42,641
What? You backsliding animal!
Didn't you tell me in there...

393
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:46,401
Oh, yes, in there.
I'd have said anything in there.

394
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:49,721
I mean, you are so eloquent,
dear Badger,

395
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:53,001
and you put your point
so frightfully well.

396
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:55,881
You could do what you like
with me in there,

397
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,521
but I'm not sorry really,
so it's no good saying I am.

398
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:03,481
Do you mean to say you don't promise
never to touch a motor car again?

399
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:09,161
On the contrary, I faithfully promise
that the first motor car I see...

400
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,241
Poop,poop!

401
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:14,201
Take him upstairs
and lock him in his bedroom.

402
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,921
Poop, poop!

403
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,441
It is worse than I thought.

404
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:22,721
We shall just have to let it...

405
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:25,841
- Poop, poop!
- ..burn itself out.

406
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:32,841
Poop,poop,poop!

407
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,441
Get out of the way!

408
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:40,681
Look out! Toad is coming!

409
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:43,281
Beep-beep! Poop, poop, poop!

410
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:47,401
Oh, dear!

411
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:50,361
We must guard him day and night.

412
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:04,401
Poop, poop! Beep-beep-beep!

413
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:23,881
Lunch,Toady.

414
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:30,761
Oh... Nothing for me, dear boy.

415
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,121
<i>What?</i>

416
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:37,841
Could you... Could you do me
one last favour and...

417
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:40,561
...fetch a lawyer?

418
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:43,121
- A lawyer?
- Yes.

419
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:47,601
So that I can make my will.

420
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:54,921
I fear it is too late... for a doctor.

421
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:58,681
Badger! Mole!

422
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,201
I think Toad's ill.

423
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:05,041
Are you sure, Rat? You know what
a fellow Toad is for play acting.

424
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:08,961
Yes, I know, but he's...
he's asked for a lawyer.

425
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,281
A lawyer!

426
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,641
- I think he's really ill.
- He doesn't look ill to me.

427
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,401
Na-na!

428
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:20,041
Quick! After him!

429
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,921
<i>Toad!</i>

430
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:34,561
Toad!

431
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:45,921
Oh!

432
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:49,601
Oh, oh!

433
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:58,081
<i>He must have gone this way.</i>

434
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,401
Come on, Mole.

435
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,361
Where are you going?

436
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:17,801
Mole! Come on.

437
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,481
Ah-ha!

438
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:46,761
I say, I wonder if you could help me?

439
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,641
Having a spot of bother with me car.

440
00:43:49,721 --> 00:43:51,641
Oh? What sort of bother?

441
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:56,481
Erm, er, it's the, er, crankshaft...

442
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,921
It's, erm, flat.

443
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,401
Really? Ah-ha.
I should be able to fix that.

444
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:04,801
Oh! Shall I come, too, Wedgie?

445
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,801
Er, wh-wh-where's your machine?

446
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:12,481
Erm, oh, it's over there,
if you'd just take a look at it.

447
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:16,241
Certainly, old bean.
Anything for a fellow motorist.

448
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,721
<i>Oh, I Say!</i>

449
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:25,521
Oh! Wedgie!

450
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:32,041
Fellow... Fellow flagged me down

451
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:34,921
with a cock-and-bull-story
about a flat crankshaft.

452
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:39,601
Well, I always help a fellow motorist.
Got out, cad hopped in and away!

453
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:41,081
Er, chap's a damned frog!

454
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,401
- Poop, poop!
- I say!

455
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:48,721
Fat face!

456
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:50,401
Now then!

457
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:51,801
- I say!
' Wedgie!

458
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:53,761
<i>Moley!</i>

459
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:56,881
<i>Moley, where are you going?</i>

460
00:44:58,521 --> 00:44:59,521
Moley!

461
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:03,401
I am cold and I'm tired
and I'm going home.

462
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:07,521
I've finished with Toad.
The Riverbank's this way, come on.

463
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:15,321
It'll be good to be
in the warm and have a bite to eat, hmm?

464
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:17,601
Yes, I'll be glad to be home again,
won't you?

465
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,401
Mole?

466
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,961
What is it, old fellow?
Whatever can be the matter?

467
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:37,681
I know it's a shabby, dingy little
place, not like your cosy quarters,

468
00:45:37,761 --> 00:45:40,361
or Badger's or Toad's beautiful hall...

469
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:45,641
...but it was my own little home
and I went away and forgot all about it

470
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:49,401
and then I smelt it and I wanted it.

471
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,921
But you wouldn't stop, Ratty, and...

472
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,841
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

473
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:59,201
I had to leave it
and I thought my heart would break.

474
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:01,641
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

475
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,801
I see it all now.

476
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,921
What a pig I've been.

477
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,241
Well, come on, old fellow.

478
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:13,281
Where...
where ever are you going to, Ratty?

479
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:17,961
We are going to find that old home
of yours, so you'd better come along.

480
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,761
We shall need your nose.

481
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:51,921
<i>Oh, Ratty. Why ever did I do it?</i>

482
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:55,241
Why did I bring you
to this poor, cold little place?

483
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:57,321
You might have been at Riverbank by now,

484
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:00,201
toasting your toes
before a blazing fire.

485
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:02,081
Hang Riverbank.

486
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:04,721
What a capital little house this is.

487
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:07,921
So... compact.

488
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:10,841
Well, we'll make a jolly night of it,
Moley.

489
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:21,161
Now, the first thing we want
is a good fire.

490
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:25,601
Well, bustle about, old chap.

491
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:29,681
Oh, Rat. How about your supper?
I've nothing to give you, not a crumb!

492
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,921
There's the carol singers,
they come here every year.

493
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:37,681
I've nothing to give them either.

494
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:41,121
What a fellow you are
for giving in, Mole.

495
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:46,001
I distinctly saw a sardine tin-opener,
so there must be sardines at least.

496
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:48,521
There's no bread, no butter.

497
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:51,321
No paté de foie gras, no Champagne.

498
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:54,841
Now come with me and forage.

499
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:59,041
<i>4' Goodman Joseph
Toiled through the snow</i>

500
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:24,321
Oh, look, I mean... nothing to eat?

501
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,521
Well, I mean, this is fit for a king.

502
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:36,161
Is this the cellar?
What about some mulled wine?

503
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:39,401
<i>A“ ..By your fire to bide</i>

504
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:54,801
<i>A“ Blowing fingers and stamping feet</i>

505
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:05,121
<i>A“ You by the fire and we in the street</i>

506
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:21,201
<i>A“ Who were the first to cry Noel?</i>

507
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:45,721
Well sung, boys.

508
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:48,761
Now come and have something
to eat and drink.

509
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:09,521
Absent friends.

510
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,561
Badger and Toad, wherever he may be.

511
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:16,161
'Scuse me, sir, but 'aven't you 'eard?

512
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:19,281
Heard what? And don't drop your Hs.

513
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:21,521
About Mr Toad, sir.

514
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:23,201
What about him?

515
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:27,641
Well, sir, 'e's...
he's got his self harrested.

516
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:31,641
<i>OH, NO.</i>

517
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:33,761
<i>I knew it.</i>

518
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:47,881
To my mind, the only difficulty
in this very clear case

519
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:53,081
is how to make it sufficiently hot
for the incorrigible rogue

520
00:50:53,161 --> 00:50:59,281
and hardened ruffian, whom we see
cowering in the dock before us.

521
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:03,801
He has been found guilty
on the clearest evidence.

522
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:05,961
First, of stealing

523
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,201
- a valuable motor car...
- Bounder!

524
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:12,761
...secondly, of driving
to the public danger

525
00:51:12,841 --> 00:51:18,161
and, thirdly, of gross impertinence
to the rural police.

526
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,481
Namely, addressing a constable
as "fat face".

527
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:24,721
<i>Now then...</i>

528
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:27,321
<i>- Oh I say.</i>

529
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:34,361
Mr Clerk, what is the stiffest,
the very stiffest penalty,

530
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:38,401
we can impose for each of these
offences, without, of course,

531
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:43,641
giving the prisoner the benefit of
any doubt, because there isn't any.

532
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:48,281
Well, ma'am, you might give
12 months for the theft.

533
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:50,681
Which is mild.

534
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:55,001
And, er, three years
for furious driving.

535
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:57,281
Ha! Which is lenient.

536
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:03,281
And 15 years for the cheek,
which was pretty bad sort of cheek.

537
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:07,801
Namely, calling him "fat face".

538
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:10,601
Now then...

539
00:52:10,681 --> 00:52:14,161
- That adds up to, er...
- Nineteen years.

540
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:16,801
Nineteen years?

541
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:21,241
And another year for being green.

542
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:23,801
Twenty years!

543
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:28,921
I've been told you are a criminal

544
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:34,721
of deepest guilt and matchless
artfulness and resource.

545
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,401
Whatever that means.

546
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:42,761
And I intend to watch and ward you
with all my skill.

547
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:48,641
So you will languish for 20 years
in the deepest dungeon

548
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:50,761
in the best guarded jail

549
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:55,481
in the length and breadth of
Merry England.

550
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:06,641
Oh... Badger.

551
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:09,521
Moley.

552
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:11,921
Ratty.

553
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:16,161
Oh, where are you now?

554
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,801
It's agreed then.

555
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:24,521
While Toad is... incarcerated,

556
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,401
we must not leave Toad Hall unprotected.

557
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:29,921
I shall take charge of it.

558
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,081
I owe it to his father.

559
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:37,961
Poor Toad, lonely Toad,
forgotten Toad.

560
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,001
There you are, daughter.

561
00:53:42,881 --> 00:53:46,041
Oh, now, cheer up, Toad.

562
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:50,201
Sit up and dry your eyes
and be a sensible animal.

563
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:54,161
Father says you haven't had
a bite to eat for days. Here.

564
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:55,841
No.

565
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,441
Nothing.

566
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:01,241
Take it away.

567
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,921
I've brought you something
I've made myself.

568
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,641
It's bubble and squeak.

569
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:11,441
Bubble and... squeak?

570
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:13,001
It's piping hot.

571
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:15,681
<i>Mm...</i>

572
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,161
That's better.

573
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:29,521
I don't know when I've had better
bubble and...

574
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:33,801
...squeak. Even at Toad Hall.

575
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,881
Toad Hall? Is that where you live?

576
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:42,721
Mm! Oh, the finest gentleman's residence
in England.

577
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:45,001
Splendid architecture,

578
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,241
<i>superbly furnished.</i>

579
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:52,441
<i>The most elegant china, valuable silver,</i>

580
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:55,921
<i>tapestries, works of art.</i>

581
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,721
<i>Stained glass windows.</i>

582
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:01,961
<i>If only you could see it.</i>

583
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:13,841
I really do miss Toad Hall
at this time of year.

584
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:16,801
The daffodils, the primroses

585
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:19,241
and of course the parties.

586
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:22,321
People so enjoyed my speeches.

587
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,921
Oh, and my songs.

588
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:27,761
<i>And my jokes!
Ch, so witty./i></i>

589
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:29,801
- Toad?
- Hmm?

590
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:31,881
I have an aunt who's a washerwoman.

591
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:34,401
There, there, never mind,
think no more about it.

592
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:36,921
I have several aunts
who ought to be Washerwomen.

593
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:42,281
Toad, do be quiet. My Aunt Maud
does all the washing in the jail.

594
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,521
People are used to her coming in and out

595
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,921
and you're very much like her in build.

596
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:49,321
I am not!

597
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:53,681
I have a very elegant figure,
for what I am.

598
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:57,201
So has my aunt for what she is.
Here, try it on.

599
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:04,561
You're not suggesting that I should
disguise myself as a washerwoman?

600
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:07,921
You are a horrid, proud,
ungrateful animal,

601
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,681
when I'm trying to help you escape.

602
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,681
I thought it was a shame
you were shut up here for so long.

603
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:16,801
You never hurt anyone
or did any real harm.

604
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:20,801
Have it your own way. You can
stay here forever for all I care.

605
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:28,081
Oh. There, there.

606
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:33,001
You are a good... kind...

607
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:36,881
...clever girl.

608
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:43,041
And I am indeed a proud and...
and stupid Toad.

609
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:56,401
Night, Maud.

610
00:57:56,481 --> 00:57:59,001
<i>Er, good night, old, er, chap.</i>

611
00:58:03,241 --> 00:58:04,761
"Old chap"?

612
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:07,881
Maud!

613
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,201
Ring the bells!

614
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:15,561
The police!

615
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:19,401
- Oh...
- Stop him! Here he is.

616
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,401
Bring him back!

617
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,641
<i>- Oh, oh... Oh!</i>

618
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:29,721
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

619
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:31,401
<i>Come on.</i>

620
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:44,321
Stop him.

621
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,001
Oh, no.

622
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:55,481
Hello, madam.

623
00:58:55,561 --> 00:59:00,441
Oh, sir, I am a poor unhappy washerwoman

624
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:06,001
and I've lost all my money
and I must get home tonight.

625
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:08,801
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

626
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:12,921
That's bad. Got some kids
waiting for you, too, I dare say.

627
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,601
Eh? Oh, er, yeah, oh,
any amount of them.

628
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:19,361
Alright. It's against company
regulations, but up you come.

629
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:22,441
<i>Stop him!</i>

630
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:26,441
- Oh, Wedgie.
- I say.

631
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,561
Rosemary, isn't that the frog
who stole my car?

632
00:59:41,921 --> 00:59:44,681
Fifty years next time!

633
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:46,401
I say, old bean.

634
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:47,841
Where's my car?

635
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,681
Oh, Wedgie.

636
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:51,761
<i>Stop him!</i>

637
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:56,921
<i>A“ The clever men at Oxford
know all that's to be known</i>

638
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:03,401
Seventy!

639
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:06,961
I say! You there, stop.

640
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:10,521
Now then!

641
01:00:21,401 --> 01:00:22,801
What's going on?

642
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:27,241
You're a funny kind of washerwoman
and there's a train following us.

643
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:32,201
A train?
Oh, dear, kind Mr engine driver.

644
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:34,641
I am not really a washerwoman.

645
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:40,041
No, no, I'm... I'm a poor,
unfortunate Toad pursued by the law.

646
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:43,081
The law, eh? What did you do?

647
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:47,001
I only... borrowed a motor car.

648
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:49,721
Borrowed, eh?

649
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:53,401
Still... I don't hold with motor cars.

650
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:54,641
<i>Stop him!</i>

651
01:00:54,721 --> 01:00:59,001
And I don't hold with being
ordered about on me own engine.

652
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:01,401
Go on, hop off.

653
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,561
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

654
01:01:09,401 --> 01:01:10,721
<i>Stop him!</i>

655
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,841
<i>- I say!
- Wedgie.</i>

656
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:32,881
Ah... home at last.

657
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,641
Must spread the good news.

658
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:37,841
Why don't I go to Ratty's first?

659
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,241
Who is it, Ratty?

660
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:08,081
I have no idea.

661
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:12,601
Don't you know me, Ratty?
It's me, Toad.

662
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:15,081
<i>- Toad!</i>

663
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:21,081
Ratty, such trials and tribulations,
so nobly born.

664
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:26,081
Such escapes, such subterfuges,
all so clever.

665
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:29,721
- I am a smart Toad and no mistake...
- Toady!

666
01:02:29,801 --> 01:02:33,521
Hello, Mole! Wait till I tell you
all about my adventures.

667
01:02:33,601 --> 01:02:37,601
Toad, stop boasting and swaggering
and behave yourself.

668
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,161
You look like a washerwoman.

669
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:43,881
Mm? Ah, well, I'll tell you about that,

670
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:48,001
but first if you'll give me
a little light dinner,

671
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:49,921
perhaps a glass of claret,

672
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:53,921
and then I'll stroll up to Toad Hall
and get a change of clothes.

673
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:56,441
Oh, Toady, you haven't heard.

674
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,001
Mm? Heard? Heard what?

675
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,921
The fact is, Toad,
that while you were having

676
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:04,801
that little bit of trouble, erm...

677
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,081
The weasels have taken Toad Hall.

678
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:11,921
Taken Toad Hall?

679
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:18,241
What were my friends doing while
I was lying helpless in my dungeon?

680
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:21,281
I thought at least
you and Mole and Badger...

681
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:23,241
Don't talk about Badger.

682
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:26,201
You... You don't mean...

683
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:29,521
They were too strong, even for Badger.

684
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:39,601
Oh... Noble Badger. Best of friends.

685
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:42,841
Eloquent, kind-hearted.

686
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:44,321
Faithful.

687
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:47,161
Now then, Toad. That's enough.

688
01:03:47,841 --> 01:03:49,841
Huh? Badger!

689
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:52,041
Glad you're back.

690
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:56,121
While Rat and Mole have been
looking after me so kindly,

691
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:58,361
I've been thinking about Toad Hall.

692
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:01,881
Oh, Badger,

693
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:05,921
I shall never see
my dear old home again.

694
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:08,841
It's lost. Lost forever.

695
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:11,041
Lost? Nonsense.

696
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:14,761
I have a plan.

697
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:03,841
Mm...

698
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,481
<i>They're doubling up the sentries
on the west gate.</i>

699
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,601
<i>And there are four extra weasels
on the main gate.</i>

700
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:18,041
<i>Hello.
They're putting guards on the roof.</i>

701
01:05:21,681 --> 01:05:23,761
Morning, you fellows!

702
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:26,921
Oh, hello, Toad. There's tea in the pot.

703
01:05:27,561 --> 01:05:31,401
By 9:00, the banquet
should be in full swing.

704
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:33,681
So we should be in the secret tunnel
by...

705
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:36,721
Ooh! ls there a secret tunnel?

706
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:41,441
Your father, a worthy animal,
confided in me,

707
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:46,321
but he said that only in the direst need
should I inform you of it.

708
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,281
<i>ON.</i>

709
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,721
I know. It's that squeaky board
in the butler's pantry.

710
01:05:51,801 --> 01:05:53,641
Not at all.

711
01:05:53,721 --> 01:05:56,401
Don't interrupt us, Toady,
there's a good fellow.

712
01:05:56,481 --> 01:05:59,201
Now, about weapons, pistols of course.

713
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:03,081
My old blunderbuss is rather
heavy, but we might be glad of it.

714
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:07,401
<i>Depends how many sentries are
on duty. How many can you see, Toad?</i>

715
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:12,921
Er... four.

716
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:14,881
<i>Only four?</i>

717
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:17,561
Er, erm... er...

718
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:20,401
And a washerwoman.

719
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:21,921
Hello, Toad.

720
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:23,721
Wait... That's...

721
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:26,361
I say, you fellows,
I've had such a time!

722
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:29,561
Oh!
Where have you been, Mole?

723
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:31,561
Why, to Toad Hall, of course.

724
01:06:32,361 --> 01:06:35,321
I marched up there as bold as brass.

725
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:38,761
"Good morning, gentlemen," says I
to the sentries. Very respectful.

726
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:40,721
"Want any washing done?"

727
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:44,521
And the sergeant, he said to me,
"Run away, my good woman, run away!"

728
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,121
"Run away?" says I.

729
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:50,641
"It won't be me that will be running
away a short time from now."

730
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:53,241
"You're going to be attacked."

731
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:55,641
You didn't say that!

732
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,201
I said a lot more.

733
01:06:57,281 --> 01:07:01,361
"A hundred bloodthirsty Badgers,"
I said, "are going to attack Toad Hall

734
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:03,921
with six boatloads of Rats
armed to the teeth

735
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:08,361
and a picked body of Toads, known as
the Die-Hards or Death-or-Glory Toads,

736
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,841
will storm the orchard
yelling for vengeance."

737
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:13,681
"There won't be much left of you
to wash," I says,

738
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:15,801
"by the time they've done with you."

739
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:22,681
Oh, Mole, you silly ass!

740
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:24,921
You've ruined the surprise!

741
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:27,441
You've been and spoiled everything.

742
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:29,681
Toad, surely Badger told you...

743
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:33,321
Mole, you have done well.
I am exceedingly pleased with you.

744
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:34,801
Wha... But...

745
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:38,521
Now, all depends upon tonight.

746
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,561
The entrance to the tunnel
is along here.

747
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:57,681
<i>- Oh! That tunnel...</i>

748
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,921
Take that!

749
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:05,241
Ah.

750
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:13,681
<i>Oh!</i>

751
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:02,241
<i>r There was smashing in of window
and crashing in of door</i>

752
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:16,841
<i>Toad!</i>

753
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:19,881
<i>Quiet, you ass.</i>

754
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:22,281
I was only trying...

755
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:23,801
<i>Quiet, you were told.</i>

756
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:27,561
<i>a' Go the drums</i>

757
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:24,441
<i>Toad!</i>

758
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:28,921
One more sound out of you
and back you'll go.

759
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:45,041
I say, they are going it.

760
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:46,801
Quiet for the chief.

761
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:51,201
Quiet for the king! Quiet!

762
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:55,281
And now, a toast...

763
01:10:55,361 --> 01:10:59,921
...to our kind host, Mr Toad.

764
01:11:02,001 --> 01:11:04,081
How dare they?

765
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:07,121
Now, we all know Toad.

766
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:11,321
<i>- Sensible Toad.</i>

767
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:15,201
Modest Toad.

768
01:11:15,281 --> 01:11:18,761
<i>- Brave Toad.</i>

769
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:22,001
The toast is...

770
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:25,241
Down with Toad!

771
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:31,201
Hmm! I'll give him "down with Toad",
and in my own banqueting hall, too!

772
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:47,601
I, er... I think we'd...
better wait for the others.

773
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:49,201
Others?

774
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,681
The hundred Badgers and all those Rats

775
01:11:51,761 --> 01:11:54,601
and the Death-or-Glory Toads.

776
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:57,841
We could do with a few more Moles
as well.

777
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:00,921
Where are the others?

778
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:03,361
<i>There are no others, Toad.</i>

779
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:08,721
N-No... n-n-n-no... n-no... no others?

780
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:13,121
No, Toad. There's just Badger, Rat,
me and... and you, Toad.

781
01:12:13,761 --> 01:12:19,121
But thanks to our young friend, Mole,
they think there are hundreds of us.

782
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,321
Come on.

783
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:23,801
Ah! Always a Toad.

784
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:27,521
Toad!

785
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,921
Wahey!

786
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,841
Chief, it's old Badger!

787
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:52,121
Riverbankers! Riverbankers!

788
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:57,361
Mole! Mole! Mole! Mole!

789
01:12:57,441 --> 01:13:00,441
One thump and one thump
and one thump and...

790
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:07,241
<i>Missed again.</i>

791
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:15,201
Look out, Mole!

792
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:24,081
A Toad! Always a T...

793
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:52,601
Behind you, Badger!

794
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:55,641
Thump 'em and thump 'em and thump 'em.

795
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:06,361
Mr Toad!

796
01:14:14,281 --> 01:14:15,521
Well done, Toad.

797
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:20,921
Badger, I didn't do anything.

798
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:25,721
You fellows did it all, I just...
I mean, hooray!

799
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:21,441
Did I tell you Toad said
he might be dropping in for tea?

800
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,881
He's quite a reformed character.

801
01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:26,961
More like his esteemed father every day.

802
01:15:27,801 --> 01:15:31,161
We may indeed congratulate ourselves.

803
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:35,801
Still, it was rather exciting,
wasn't it?

804
01:15:35,881 --> 01:15:38,041
I'm almost sorry it's all over...

805
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:46,041
Hello, you fellows!

806
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:50,441
- You maniac!
- Lock him up!

807
01:15:50,521 --> 01:15:53,841
Toad, this time you've gone too far!

808
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:58,001
Hang motoring, this is the life!

809
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,321
Oh... Yes, er...

810
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:07,801
Oh, no.

811
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:11,561
Oh, dear.

812
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:16,201

813
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:19,281
Oh. Er...

814
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,321
I say, you chaps.

815
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:34,481
Ah! You're just the chap
I wanted to see, Ratty.

816
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:37,001
And you, too, Mole.
