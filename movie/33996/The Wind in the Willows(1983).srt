00:34:20.6:When you're underground, nothing can get at you
00:34:23.6:Uh  Exactly what I say
00:34:28.0:Look! Rat  now
00:34:29.4:Couple feet of flood water, and he has to move

00:34:36.2:Very splendid, but straw prophet??
00:34:39.8:Not   Not
00:34:41.5:Underground is my ideal home

00:34:59.4:Smashing an old car
00:35:01.5:O  What's the same thing with Toad
00:35:03.7:Is this a seven-frety, isn't it?
00:35:05.9:Yes...(Ir-responsible animal)
00:35:10.3:He is a hopelessly dull driver with no fault to Lord order
00:35:13.6:He will kill someone
00:35:16.6:Sooner or later
00:35:17.3:Well, I was his age, we didn't around in the countryside, frightening people
00:35:22.9:We had better things to do at our time
00:35:27.8:Ah Cricketer! Are you?
00:35:30.5:Good Good
00:35:35.4:Now about Toad
00:35:40.2:Ah  Yes, if we are his friends, Badger
00:35:44.1:We really ought to do something
00:35:45.9:He is giving other animals a bad name
00:35:49.4:You are entirely correct
00:35:53.0:Moreover, his father was a friend of mine-
00:35:56.2:most respectable Toad
00:36:00.2:What do you think we should do with it, Mr. Badger
00:36:03.1:I think that you and I and a friend here
00:36:08.2:to take Toad seriously in hand
00:36:12.5:We will stand no non-sense for ever
00:36:14.7:We will bring him back to reason by force if necessary
00:36:18.6:We are...Uh (it) has strucken
00:36:23.6:Should we agree that?

00:36:28.0:I...I quiteablely,  definitely no question
00:36:32.4:First thing in the morning, we will pay a call to Toad
00:36:49.0:Hullo!  You fellows
00:36:52.1:You are just in time to confront jolly spining in my new-
00:36:58.2:in my new...you will not be needing that machine
00:37:03.4:I shall sent it back
00:37:05.8:What!  I say...I
00:37:08.4:Toad, you will give us your solemn promise-
00:37:13.4:never to touch a motor-car again
00:37:17.7:Certainly not!
00:37:19.3:Inside, take him to the library
00:37:22.2:And I will try what arguments can do
00:37:26.7:It's on your own good, Toad
00:37:29.0:I am sorry, Toad, but really it is
00:37:31.3:Now do catch Toad
00:37:34.1:I say:  Stop it
00:37:36.2:Why you, I say, you chaps out
00:37:41.0:We'll see whether you come out of that room the same Toad that you went in
00:37:47.1:Let go,  you can't...  Let go out
00:37:54.7:You knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad
00:38:01.8:You've disregarded all the warnings weĄŚve give you
00:38:04.5:YouĄŚve gone on squandering the money you father let
00:38:09.3:and youĄŚre getting us animals a bad name in the district
00:38:12.6:by your furious driving and your smashes and your rows with the police.
00:38:17.8:Independence is all very well
00:38:21.3:but we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves
00:38:26.3:beyond a certain limit and that limit youĄŚve reached
00:38:30.2:Now youĄŚre a good fellow in many respects
00:38:34.9:and I donĄŚt want to be too hard on yu
00:38:37.4:IĄŚll make one more effort to bring you to reason
00:38:43.0:oh I am indeed a foolish Toad
00:38:46.4:No, never again, never ever again
00:38:54.8:My friends, I am pleased to inform you
00:39:00.4:that Toad has seen the error of his ways
00:39:03.5:He is truly sorry for what he has done
00:39:07.4:and perceive the folly of it all?
00:39:11.1:That is good news
00:39:12.7:Do you?  Toad
00:39:14.0:Do you really?
00:39:18.0:No   Aha,   I am not sorry at all
00:39:20.2:Ha   And it wasnĄŚt folly, it was simply glorious
00:39:23.4:What? You backsliding animal, didnĄŚt you tell me in there?
00:39:28.4:Yes, in THERE, I did say anything in THERE
00:39:32.1:You're so eloquent, dear Badger
00:39:35.2:And you put all your points so frightfully well
00:39:38.5:You can do what you like with me in THERE
00:39:41.0:But I am not sorry really, so it's no good saying I am
00:39:45.1:Do you mean to say you donĄŚt promise never to touch a motor-car again?
00:39:48.8:On the contrary, I faithfully promise that the very first motor-car I see
00:39:54.3:Poop  Poop
00:39:55.8:Take him upstairs and lock him in his bedroom
00:40:02.5:It is worse than I thought

00:45:26.7:But it was my own little home
00:45:27.9:When I went away and forgot all about it
00:45:31.1:then I smelt it
00:45:33.0:and I wanted it

00:47:20.0:I've nothing to give them, either
00:47:22.8:What a fellow you are for giving in
00:47:26.8:I distinctly saw a sardine opener, so there must be sardines, Mr. please!
00:47:31.9:There is no bread, no butter-
00:47:34.6:no pate de foie gras, no champagne
00:47:38.0:Now come with me and forage
00:47:40.6:Goodman Joseph toiled through the snow
00:47:44.2:Saw the star oĄŚer a stable low
00:47:51.2:Mary she might not further go

00:48:09.5:I mean these seems for a king
00:48:15.1:Though wind may follow,and snow-
00:48:18.9:Is this the salad?
00:48:20.0:What about some mold wine?
00:48:21.9:..Draw us in by your by your fire to bide

00:48:45.9:You by the fire and we in the street
00:48:50.3:Bidding you joy in the morning!

00:49:59.0:Excuse me, Sir
00:50:00.8:Have you heard?
00:50:02.4:Heard what?
00:50:02.6:??
00:50:05.8:About Mr. Toad, sir
00:50:07.7:What about it?
00:50:09.2:Well  sir, he is got himself arrested
00:50:14.5:O    No
00:50:17.3:I knew it
00:50:28.2:To my mind,
00:50:29.5:the ONLY difficulty in this very clear case
00:50:33.4:is how to make it sufficiently hot
00:50:35.8:for the incorrigible rogue and hardened ruffian
00:50:40.5:whom we see cowering in the dock before us.
00:50:44.5:He has been found guilty, on the clearest evidence
00:50:49.0:First, of stealing a valuable motor-car
00:50:53.7:Secondly, of driving to the public danger
00:50:58.6:And thirdly, of gross impertinence to the rural police
00:51:03.1:Namely, this is as considerable as Fat Fist
00:51:08.9:Yes,it is
00:51:10.3:O  I see
00:51:14.1:Mr. Clerk
00:51:15.2:What is the stiffest.. the very stiffest penalty we can impose for each of these offences?
00:51:22.4:Without, of course, giving the prisoner the benefit of any doubt
00:51:26.7:Because there isn't any
00:51:28.9:No Mam! you might give twelve months for the theft
00:51:34.0:which is mild
00:51:36.2:and three years for the furious driving
00:51:40.4:which is lenient
00:51:42.3:and fifteen years for the cheek
00:51:45.8:which was pretty bad sort of cheek
00:51:49.0:Namely, for him, Fat Fist
00:51:56.3:It is up to ..Uh
00:51:57.4:nineteen years
00:51:59.7:Nineteen years!
00:52:02.8:-and another year for being thief-
00:52:06.9:Twenty years!
00:52:09.5:I've been told-
00:52:12.1:you are a criminal of deepest guilt
00:52:16.3:and matchless artfulness and resource
00:52:20.5:Whatever that means
00:52:22.7:And I intend to watch and ward you with all my skills
00:52:27.3:So you will languish for twenty years
00:52:32.1:in a deepest dungeon
00:52:34.1:in a best-quarded chile
00:52:36.2:in a land ??vanperrempus or merrybindent

01:03:35.1:There you are back
01:03:37.4:While Rat and Mole have been looking out for me so kindly
01:03:41.4:I have been thinking about Toad Hall
01:03:44.2:O Badger! I should never see my dear old home again
01:03:51.4:It's los-lost forever
01:03:54.7:Lost? Nonsense

01:04:49.5:The dabblings have sentries on the west gate
01:04:54.0:and four extra weasels on the main gate

01:05:16.7:So we should be in the secret tunnel by

01:05:22.2:Your father and the ??wordid animal can find it and me..
01:05:27.3:but he said only in the days in need
01:05:29.3:Should I inform you of it
01:05:31.8:O    I know exactly that squeaky board in the butler's pantry
01:05:36.8:Not at all
01:05:38.3:Don't disrupt, Toady, there is a good fellow
01:05:41.8:Now about weapons

01:05:46.0:we might be glad
01:05:47.6:Depends on how many sentries are on duty outside
