1
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,001
Oh, no.

2
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,801
Now then...

3
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:17,641
Oh.

4
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,081
Bother.

5
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,561
Oh.

6
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:09,601
Eugh!

7
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,081
Oh, dear.

8
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,881
That's better.

9
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:47,201
Bother and blow!

10
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,521
<i>So much to do.</i>

11
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,321
Oh, hang spring-cleaning!

12
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,161
Oh, my! Oh, my!

13
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,481
Ah.

14
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,441
Oh!

15
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,761
Oh.

16
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,321
<i>Hello.</i>

17
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,601
- Rat?
- Hello, Mole!

18
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:06,721
Didn't think you chaps
ever came out in the sunlight.

19
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:09,521
Why don't you come over?

20
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,441
Oh, it's all very well to talk.

21
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,121
Ah, yes.

22
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,961
- A boat.
-  That's right.

23
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:29,161
Hang on to that.

24
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,121
Thank you.

25
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,201
Come on, step lively.

26
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,441
Ooh...

27
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:39,521
I've... ne-never been in a boat.

28
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,601
Never been in a...

29
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,361
Well, I...
What have you been doing all your life?

30
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,721
L-Is it... so nice?

31
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,881
Nice?  It's the only thing.

32
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,521
Believe me, there is nothing,

33
00:07:54,601 --> 00:08:00,281
absolutely nothing half so much worth
doing as simply messing about in boats.

34
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,561
Messing about, er, in boats.

35
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,201
Simply messing.

36
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,481
- Look out, Rat!
-  Oh!

37
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,921
<i>Ooh'.!</i>

38
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,641
Are... Are you alright?

39
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,521
Yes. Messing about in boats.

40
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:27,601
Or with boats.
In or out of them, it doesn't matter.

41
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,241
Look here, if you've nothing else
on hand this afternoon,

42
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,721
would you care to go for
a row down the river?

43
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:36,961
Care to?

44
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,001
We might have a picnic.

45
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,681
<i>Shove that down there.</i>

46
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,881
- Y-Your house?
-  That's right.

47
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,601
<i>Oh, my.</i>

48
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,441
So, this is a river.

49
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,001
The river.

50
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,401
You really live by the river?

51
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:29,521
By it and with it
and on it and in it.

52
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,241
It's brother and sister to me,

53
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,401
and aunts and company and food and drink

54
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,361
and, naturally, washing.

55
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,681
It's my world
and I don't want any other.

56
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,641
What it hasn't got isn't worth having

57
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,481
and what it doesn't know
isn't worth knowing.

58
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:49,601
Lord, the times we've had together,
whether in winter or summer,

59
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:54,641
spring or autumn, it's always got
its fun and its excitements.

60
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,601
What do you say we moor here
and have our picnic?

61
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,241
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

62
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:16,761
Now, what have we here?

63
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:19,961
There's cold chicken, cold tongue,
cold ham, cold beef.

64
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,801
Pickled gherkin salad, French rolls,
mustard and cress,

65
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,441
- potted meat, ginger beer, lemonade...
- Stop, stop, this is too much!

66
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,921
Too much? Oh, do you really think so?

67
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:32,801
It's only what I usually take
on these little excursions,

68
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,401
and Toad always tells me that I'm
a mean beast and cut things very fine.

69
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:38,481
Now, pitch in, old fellow.

70
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,041
<i>Oh, my.</i>

71
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,361
<i>My, oh, my!</i>

72
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,921
Hmm.

73
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,281
Beautiful.

74
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,401
Mmm...

75
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,121
I say. There's old Badger.

76
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,041
Badger!

77
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,081
Badger, old chap! Come and join us.

78
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,521
Company.

79
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,401
Yes, that's just the sort of fellow
he is.

80
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:52,801
Simply hates society.
He'll be off home now.

81
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,561
Where does he live?

82
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,481
- In the Wild Wood.
- Oh.

83
00:11:57,561 --> 00:12:01,001
We don't go there very much,
we river people.

84
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,121
Is there something wrong with it?

85
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:08,521
Er, well, not wrong exactly.

86
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,841
The squirrels are alright and the
hedgehogs and some of the rabbits.

87
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:16,041
And of course, no one interferes
with Badger. They'd better not.

88
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:18,681
Why? Wh-Who should interfere with him?

89
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,361
Well, there are others,
stoats and weasels.

90
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,121
Hello there, Mr Rat.

91
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,521
Having a picnic with your friend?

92
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,801
- Ooh, very nice.
- Leave that alone.

93
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,001
Very nice.

94
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:41,361
You ought to visit us Wild Wooders
one day, sir.

95
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,601
You don't wanna believe
everything people say about us.

96
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,241
Afternoon, gentlemen.

97
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,041
They don't seem too bad.

98
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:00,281
Well, they're alright in a way, but...

99
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,161
Well, I never go to the Wild Wood

100
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,121
and you won't either
if you've got any sense.

101
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,201
Hello...

102
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:08,881
Where is the potted meat?

103
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:14,881
I couldn't eat another bite.

104
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,721
Well, I suppose I really ought
to pack the basket.

105
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,401
Oh, do let me.

106
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:24,561
My dear fellow, please do
if you'd really like to.

107
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,001
Oh.

108
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,201
Oh... Oh, bother.

109
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,081
Don't worry about that, old chap.

110
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:49,241
Oh, what a splendid time
we're having.

111
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:53,401
Look here, why don't you come
and stay with me for a few days?

112
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:56,201
I live in a very plain and simple way.

113
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:58,801
My home is nothing like Toad Hall.

114
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,561
Toad Hall?

115
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,881
Oh, of course.
You haven't met Toad yet, have you?

116
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,561
Why don't we drop down the river
and call on him?

117
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:10,801
I... I suppose...
I couldn't row, could I?

118
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:14,281
Bother! Oh, bother.

119
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,641
Both oars together, old chap,
if you can manage it.

120
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,161
Oh, yes, Rat.

There's Toad Hall.

136
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,121
My goodness.

137
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:51,641
You're sure it's alright to
call on Mr Toad unannounced?

138
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,401
Oh, certainly.

139
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,841
It's never the wrong time
to call on Toad.

140
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:06,321
- Yes, dear old Toad.
- He always has some new craze, you know.

141
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,041
I managed to get him
interested in sculling.

142
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:12,601
He's not much good at it,
but it keeps him out of mischief.

143
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:17,241
He's the best of animals really.
So good natured and affectionate.

144
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:20,521
Perhaps he's not very clever,
but we can't all be geniuses,

145
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,681
and he may be rather boastful
and conceited,

146
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,521
but he has some great qualities,
has Toady.

147
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:29,521
And Toad Hall is one of
the finest houses in these parts.

148
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,561
Though, of course,
we never say so to Toad.

149
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:36,961
- Ah-ha!
-  Hello, Toad. This is Mole.

150
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,321
Oh! Hello, Mole.

151
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:42,241
Hooray! This is splendid.

152
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,841
Ratty, you're just the chap
I wanted to see.

153
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,641
Having trouble with your boating?

154
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:50,281
Oh, poo! Boating?
I've given that up long ago.

155
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,001
I've discovered the real thing.

156
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:56,081
The only genuine occupation
of a lifetime.

157
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,601
Ooh-hoe! Come and see.

158
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,601
Come along, come along. Just over here.

159
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,401
There you are.

160
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,921
The open road,
the dusty highway.

161
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:14,321
Here today and up and off

Of course I will, Rat.

Looks as though it might snow.

Besides, Badger lives in the middle of
the Wild Wood, underground.

277
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,321
Not our sort of place at all.

It's alright, old fellow.

303
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,761
But you really shouldn't
have come to the Wild Wood.

304
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:38,521
I did try to warn you.

305

Hmm... We must get home.

306
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,121
The trouble is, everything looks
so different in the snow.

307
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:51,561
Ratty, I'm so sorry, but...
I don't think I can walk any further.

308
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,881
Now, you must try, old chap.

309
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:57,841

- It's me, Rat, and my friend, Mole.

325
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,881
Do let us in, please.

326
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:51,881
Oh... Why, Ratty, my dear little man.

327
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,841
Come along in, both of you, at once.

328
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:56,561
You must be perished.

329
00:33:56,641 --> 00:34:00,321
Well, I never, and in the Wild Wood,
too, at this time of night.

330
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:02,721
Come in with you, come in.

331
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,281
Come along, Ratty.

332
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:28,041
There's a good fire in the kitchen.
I'll get you both a nice hot drink.

333
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,521
Lovely to be underground again.

334
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,801
When you're underground,
nothing can get at you.

335
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:41,321
That's exactly what I say.

336
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:46,281
Look at Rat now, couple of feet of
floodwater and he has to move.

337
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,841
Or Toad Hall...

338
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:54,721
Oh, it's very splendid, I dare say,
but it's all draughty.

339
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,601
No, no,
underground is my idea of home.

340
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:04,521
Now then, what's the news
from your part of the world?

341
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,841
How's young Toad?

342
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:11,041
- Oh, he's going from bad to worse.
- Another smash up only last week.

343
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,801
How many has he had?

344
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:18,281
Smashes or cars? Oh, well,
it's the same thing with Toad.

345
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:21,121
- This is his seventh, Ratty, isn't it?
-  Yes.

346
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,841
Irresponsible animal.

347
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,841
He's a hopelessly bad driver
with no thought for law and order.

348
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:31,841
He'll kill someone... sooner or later.

349
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,561
When I was his age,

350
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:38,601
we didn't rush around the countryside
frightening people.

351
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,001
We had better things to do
with our time.

352
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,841
Oh!

353
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:46,801
- Ah, cricketer, are you?
- Good, good.

354
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:53,161
Now... About Toad.

355
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,401
<i>Ah, yes, erm, we are his friends,
Badger.</i>

356
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:02,081
We really ought to do something.
He's giving us animals a bad name.

357
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:07,921
You are entirely correct.

358
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,921
Moreover, his father was a friend
of mine, most respectable Toad.

359
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:17,121
Ah... What do you think
we should do, Mr Badger?

360
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:22,681
I think that you and I,
and our friend here...

361
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:27,881
...should take Toad
seriously in hand.

362
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,881
We'll stand no nonsense whatever.

363
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:34,081
We will bring him back to reason,
by force if necessary.

364
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:37,841
<i>The</i> hour <i>has struck.</i>

365
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,321
Do you agree, lad?

366
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:45,201
Er, hmm? Oh, absolutely, yes.
I-I-I quite agree, definitely.

367
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:46,281
No question.

368
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:49,241
First thing in the morning...

369
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:54,801
...we will pay a call on Toad.

370
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,441
Ah-ha! Hello, you fellows!

371
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:10,241
You're just in time
to come for a jolly spin in my new...

372
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,761
...in... in my new...

373
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:17,801
You will not be needing that... machine.

374
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:22,601
- I shall send it back.
- Wha... I say! I...

375
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:24,761
And, Toad...

376
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:30,841
You will give us your solemn promise
never to touch a motor car again.

377
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,281
Shan't!

378
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:36,281
Inside! Take him to the library!

379
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:40,601
And I will try what argument can do.

380
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,521
- Ow...
-  It's for your own good, Toad.

381
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:45,521
I'm sorry, Toad,
but really it is.

382
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:48,161
-  Mole, do catch hold of...
- Ow!

383
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:51,441
I say, stop it! What are you...?

384
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:55,601
I say, you chaps!

385
00:37:55,681 --> 00:38:01,561
We will see whether you come out of that
room the same Toad that you went in.

386
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:04,001
Let go! Ow!

387
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,961
You... cads!

388
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,401
<i>Let go! Ouch!</i>

389
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:15,041
You knew it must come to this
sooner or later, Toad.

390
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:19,441
You've disregarded
all the warnings we've given you.

391
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:24,121
You've gone on squandering the money
your father left you

392
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,961
and you're getting us animals
a bad name in the district

393
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:32,001
by your frivolous driving and your
smashes and your rows with the police.

394
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:36,321
Independence is all very well,

395
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:40,881
but we animals never allow our friends
to make fools of themselves

396
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,241
beyond a certain limit,
and that limit you've reached.

397
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,481
Oh, you're so right, Badger.

398
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:49,121
You're a good fellow,
in many respects...

399
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,121
- Oh, true.
- I don't want to be too hard on you.

400
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:57,201
I'll make one more effort
to bring you to reason.

401
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:00,561
Oh, I am indeed a foolish Toad.

402
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:07,161
No, never again. Never ever again!

403
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,401
My friends...

404
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:18,001
I am pleased to inform you that Toad
has seen the error of his ways.

405
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:24,761
He is truly sorry for what he has done
and perceives the folly of it all.

406
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:27,281
That is good news.

407
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,681
Do you, Toad? Do you really?

408
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:35,481
No!  I'm not sorry at all!

409
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,921
And it wasn't folly,
it was simply glorious!

410
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:42,641
What? You backsliding animal!
Didn't you tell me in there...

411
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:46,401
Oh, yes, in there.
I'd have said anything in there.

412
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:49,721
I mean, you are so eloquent,
dear Badger,

413
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:53,001
and you put your point
so frightfully well.

414
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:55,881
You could do what you like
with me in there,

415
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,521
but I'm not sorry really,
so it's no good saying I am.

416
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:03,481
Do you mean to say you don't promise
never to touch a motor car again?

417
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:09,161
On the contrary, I faithfully promise
that the first motor car I see...

418
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,241
Poop,poop!

419
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:14,201
Take him upstairs
and lock him in his bedroom.

420
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,921
Poop, poop!

421
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,441
It is worse than I thought.

422
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:22,721
We shall just have to let it...

423
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:25,841
- Poop, poop!
- ..burn itself out.

424
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:32,841
Poop,poop,poop!

425
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,441
Get out of the way!

426
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:40,681
Look out! Toad is coming!

427
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:43,281
Beep-beep! Poop, poop, poop!

428
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:47,401
Oh, dear!

429
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:50,361
We must guard him day and night.

430
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:04,401
Poop, poop! Beep-beep-beep!

431
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:23,881
Lunch,Toady.

432
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:30,761
Oh... Nothing for me, dear boy.

433
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,121
<i>What'?</i>

434
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:37,841
Could you... Could you do me
one last favour and...

435
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:40,561
...fetch a lawyer?

436
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:43,121
- A lawyer?
- Yes.

437
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:47,601
So that I can make my will.

438
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:54,921
I fear it is too late... for a doctor.

439
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:58,681
Badger! Mole!

440
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,201
I think Toad's ill.

441
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:05,041
Are you sure, Rat? You know what
a fellow Toad is for play acting.

442
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:08,961
Yes, I know, but he's...
he's asked for a lawyer.

443
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,281
A lawyer!

444
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,641
- I think he's really ill.
- He doesn't look ill to me.

445
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,401
Na-na!

446
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:20,041
Quick! After him!

447
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,921
Toad!

448
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:34,561
Toad!

449
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:45,921
Oh!

450
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:49,601
Oh, oh!

451
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:58,081
He must have gone this way.

452
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,401
Come on, Mole.

453
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,361
Where are you going?

454
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:17,801
Mole! Come on.

455
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,481
Ah-ha!

456
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:46,761
I say, I wonder if you could help me?

457
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,641
Having a spot of bother with me car.

458
00:43:49,721 --> 00:43:51,641
Oh? What sort of bother?

459
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:56,481
Erm, er, it's the, er, crankshaft...

460
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,921
It's, erm, flat.

461
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,401
Really? Ah-ha.
I should be able to fix that.

462
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:04,801
Oh! Shall I come, too, Wedgie?

463
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,801
Er, wh-wh-where's your machine?

464
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:12,481
Erm, oh, it's over there,
if you'd just take a look at it.

465
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:16,241
Certainly, old bean.
Anything for a fellow motorist.

466
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,721
Oh, <i>I</i> Say!

467
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:25,521
Oh! Wedgie!

468
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,281
<i>Ream]?</i>

469
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:32,041
Fellow... Fellow flagged me down

470
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:34,921
with a cock-and-bull-story
about a flat crankshaft.

471
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:39,601
Well, I always help a fellow motorist.
Got out, cad hopped in and away!

472
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:41,081
Er, chap's a damned frog!

473
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,401
- Poop, poop!
- I say!

474
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:48,721
Fat face!

475
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:50,401
Now then!

476
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:51,801
- I say!
' Wedgie!

477
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:53,761
<i>Moley!</i>

478
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:56,881
Moley, where are you going?

479
00:44:58,521 --> 00:44:59,521
Moley!

480
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:03,401
I am cold and I'm tired
and I'm going home.

481
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:07,521
I've finished with Toad.
The Riverbank's this way, come on.

482
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:15,321
It'll be good to be
in the warm and have a bite to eat, hmm?

483
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:17,601
Yes, I'll be glad to be home again,
won't you?

484
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,401
Mole?

485
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,961
What is it, old fellow?
Whatever can be the matter?

486
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:37,681
I know it's a shabby, dingy little
place, not like your cosy quarters,

487
00:45:37,761 --> 00:45:40,361
or Badger's or Toad's beautiful hall...

488
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:45,641
...but it was my own little home
and I went away and forgot all about it

489
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:49,401
and then I smelt it and I wanted it.

490
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,921
But you wouldn't stop, Ratty, and...

491
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,841
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

492
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:59,201
I had to leave it
and I thought my heart would break.

493
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:01,641
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

494
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,801
I see it all now.

495
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,921
What a pig I've been.

496
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,241
Well, come on, old fellow.

497
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:13,281
Where...
where ever are you going to, Ratty?

498
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:17,961
We are going to find that old home
of yours, so you'd better come along.

499
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,761
We shall need your nose.

500
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:51,921
Oh, Ratty. Why ever did <i>I</i> do it?

501
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:55,241
Why did I bring you
to this poor, cold little place?

502
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:57,321
You might have been at Riverbank by now,

503
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:00,201
toasting your toes
before a blazing fire.

504
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:02,081
Hang Riverbank.

505
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:04,721
What a capital little house this is.

506
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:07,921
So... compact.

507
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:10,841
Well, we'll make a jolly night of it,
Moley.

508
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:21,161
Now, the first thing we want
is a good fire.

509
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:25,601
Well, bustle about, old chap.

510
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:29,681
Oh, Rat. How about your supper?
I've nothing to give you, not a crumb!

511
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,921
There's the carol singers,
they come here every year.

512
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:37,681
I've nothing to give them either.

513
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:41,121
What a fellow you are
for giving in, Mole.

514
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:46,001
I distinctly saw a sardine tin-opener,
so there must be sardines at least.

515
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:48,521
There's no bread, no butter.

516
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:51,321
No paté de foie gras, no Champagne.

517
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:54,841
Now come with me and forage.

Absent friends.

543
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,561
Badger and Toad, wherever he may be.

544
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:16,161
'Scuse me, sir, but 'aven't you 'eard?

545
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:19,281

546
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:21,521
About Mr Toad, sir.

547
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:23,201
What about him?

548
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:27,641
Well, sir, 'e's...
he's got his self harrested.

549
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:31,641
<i>Oh, no.</i>

550
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:33,761
I knew it.

551
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:47,881
To my mind, the only difficulty
in this very clear case

552
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:53,081
is how to make it sufficiently hot
for the incorrigible rogue

553
00:50:53,161 --> 00:50:59,281
and hardened ruffian, whom we see
cowering in the dock before us.

554
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:03,801
He has been found guilty
on the clearest evidence.

555
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:05,961
First, of stealing

556
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,201
- a valuable motor car...
- Bounder!

557
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:12,761
...secondly, of driving
to the public danger

558
00:51:12,841 --> 00:51:18,161
and, thirdly, of gross impertinence
to the rural police.

559
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,481
Namely, addressing a constable
as "fat face".

560
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:24,721
<i>Now then...</i>

561
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:27,321
' <i>Oh,</i> I <i>say.</i>

562
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:34,361
Mr Clerk, what is the stiffest,
the very stiffest penalty,

563
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:38,401
we can impose for each of these
offences, without, of course,

564
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:43,641
giving the prisoner the benefit of
any doubt, because there isn't any.

565
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:48,281
Well, ma'am, you might give
12 months for the theft.

566
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:50,681
Which is mild.

567
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:55,001
And, er, three years
for furious driving.

568
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:57,281
Ha! Which is lenient.

569
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:03,281
And 15 years for the cheek,
which was pretty bad sort of cheek.

570
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:07,801
Namely, calling him "fat face".

571
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:10,601
Now then...

572
00:52:10,681 --> 00:52:14,161
- That adds up to, er...
- Nineteen years.

573
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:16,801
Nineteen years?

574
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:21,241
And another year for being green.

575
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:23,801
Twenty years!

576
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:28,921
I've been told you are a criminal

577
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:34,721
of deepest guilt and matchless
artfulness and resource.

578
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,401
Whatever that means.

579
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:42,761
And I intend to watch and ward you
with all my skill.

580
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:48,641
So you will languish for 20 years
in the deepest dungeon

581
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:50,761
in the best guarded jail

582
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:55,481
in the length and breadth of
Merry England.

583
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:06,641
Oh... Badger.

584
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:09,521
Moley.

585
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:11,921
Ratty.

586
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:16,161
Oh, where are you now?

587
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,801
It's agreed then.

588
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:24,521
While Toad is... incarcerated,

589
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,401
we must not leave Toad Hall unprotected.

590
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:29,921
I shall take charge of it.

591
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,081
I owe it to his father.

592
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:37,961
Poor Toad, lonely Toad,
forgotten Toad.

593
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,001
There you are, daughter.

594
00:53:42,881 --> 00:53:46,041
Oh, now, cheer up, Toad.

595
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:50,201
Sit up and dry your eyes
and be a sensible animal.

596
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:54,161
Father says you haven't had
a bite to eat for days. Here.

597
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:55,841
No.

598
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,441
Nothing.

599
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:01,241
Take it away.

600
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,921
I've brought you something
I've made myself.

601
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,641
It's bubble and squeak.

602
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:11,441
Bubble and... squeak?

603
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:13,001
It's piping hot.

604
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:15,681
Mm...

605
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,161
That's better.

606
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:29,521
I don't know when I've had better
bubble and...

607
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:33,801
...squeak. Even at Toad Hall.

608
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,881
Toad Hall? Is that where you live?

609
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:42,721
Mm! Oh, the finest gentleman's residence
in England.

610
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:45,001
Splendid architecture,

611
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,241
<i>superbly furnished.</i>

612
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:52,441
<i>The most elegant china, valuable silver,</i>

613
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:55,921
<i>tapestries, works of art.</i>

614
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,721
<i>Stained glass windows.</i>

615
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:01,961
<i>If only you could see it.</i>

616
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:13,841
I really do miss Toad Hall
at this time of year.

617
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:16,801
The daffodils, the primroses

618
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:19,241
and of course the parties.

619
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:22,321
People so enjoyed my speeches.

620
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,921
Oh, and my songs.

621
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:27,761
And <i>my jokes!
Ch, so</i> witty.

622
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:29,801
- Toad?
- Hmm?

623
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:31,881
I have an aunt who's a washerwoman.

624
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:34,401
There, there, never mind,
think no more about it.

625
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:36,921
I have several aunts
who ought to be Washerwomen.

626
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:42,281
Toad, do be quiet. My Aunt Maud
does all the washing in the jail.

627
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,521
People are used to her coming in and out

628
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,921
and you're very much like her in build.

629
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:49,321
I am not!

630
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:53,681
I have a very elegant figure,
for what I am.

631
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:57,201
So has my aunt for what she is.
Here, try it on.

632
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:04,561
You're not suggesting that I should
disguise myself as a washerwoman?

633
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:07,921
You are a horrid, proud,
ungrateful animal,

634
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,681
when I'm trying to help you escape.

635
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,681
I thought it was a shame
you were shut up here for so long.

636
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:16,801
You never hurt anyone
or did any real harm.

637
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:20,801
Have it your own way. You can

Why, to Toad Hall, of course.

768
01:06:32,361 --> 01:06:35,321
I marched up there as bold as brass.

769
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:38,761
"Good morning, gentlemen," says I
to the sentries. Very respectful.

770
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:40,721
"Want any washing done?"

771
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:44,521
And the sergeant, he said to me,
"Run away, my good woman, run away!"

772
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,121
"Run away?" says I.

773
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:50,641
"It won't be me that will be running
away a short time from now."

774
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:53,241
"You're going to be attacked."

775
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:55,641
You didn't say that!

776
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,201
I said a lot more.

777
01:06:57,281 --> 01:07:01,361
"A hundred bloodthirsty Badgers,"
I said, "are going to attack Toad Hall

Toad!

823
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:28,921
One more sound out of you
and back you'll go.

824
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:45,041
I say, they are going it.

825
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:46,801
Quiet for the chief.

826
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:51,201
Quiet for the king! Quiet!

827
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:55,281
And now, a toast...

828
01:10:55,361 --> 01:10:59,921
...to our kind host, Mr Toad.

829
01:11:02,001 --> 01:11:04,081
How dare they?

830
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:07,121
Now, we all know Toad.

831
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:11,321
<i>Sensible</i> Toad.

832
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:15,201
Modest Toad.

833
01:11:15,281 --> 01:11:18,761
Brave Toad.

834
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:22,001
The toast is...

835
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:25,241
Down with Toad!

836
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:31,201
Hmm! I'll give him "down with Toad",
and in my own banqueting hall, too!

837
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:47,601
I, er... I think we'd...
better wait for the others.

838
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:49,201
Others?

839
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,681
The hundred Badgers and all those Rats

840
01:11:51,761 --> 01:11:54,601
and the Death-or-Glory Toads.

841
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:57,841
We could do with a few more Moles
as well.

842
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:00,921
Where are the others?

843
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:03,361
There are no others, Toad.

844
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:08,721
N-No... n-n-n-no... n-no... no others?

845
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:13,121
No, Toad. There's just Badger, Rat,
me and... and you, Toad.

846
01:12:13,761 --> 01:12:19,121
But thanks to our young friend, Mole,
they think there are hundreds of us.

847
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,321
Come on.

848
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:23,801
Ah! Always a Toad.

849
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:27,521
Toad!

850
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,921
Wahey!

851
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,841
Chief, it's old Badger!

852
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:52,121
Riverbankers! Riverbankers!

853
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:57,361
Mole! Mole! Mole! Mole!

854
01:12:57,441 --> 01:13:00,441
One thump and one thump
and one thump and...

855
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:07,241
<i>Missed again.</i>

856
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:15,201
Look out, Mole!

857
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:24,081
A Toad! Always a T...

858
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:52,601
Behind you, Badger!

859
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:55,641
Thump 'em and thump 'em and thump 'em.

860
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:06,361
Mr Toad!

861
01:14:14,281 --> 01:14:15,521
Well done, Toad.

862
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:20,921
Badger, I didn't do anything.

863
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:25,721
You fellows did it all, I just...
I mean, hooray!

864
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:21,441
Did I tell you Toad said
he might be dropping in for tea?

865
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,881
He's quite a reformed character.

866
01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:26,961
More like his esteemed father every day.

867
01:15:27,801 --> 01:15:31,161
We may indeed congratulate ourselves.

868
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:35,801
Still, it was rather exciting,
wasn't it?

869
01:15:35,881 --> 01:15:38,041
I'm almost sorry it's all over...

870
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:46,041
Hello, you fellows!

871
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:50,441
- You maniac!
- Lock him up!

872
01:15:50,521 --> 01:15:53,841
Toad, this time you've gone too far!

873
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:58,001
Hang motoring, this is the life!

874
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,321
Oh... Yes, er...

875
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:07,801
Oh, no.

876
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:11,561
Oh, dear.

877
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:16,201
on...

878
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:19,281
Oh. Er...

879
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,321
I say, you chaps.

880
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:34,481
Ah! You're just the chap
I wanted to see, Ratty.

881
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:37,001
And you, too, Mole.
