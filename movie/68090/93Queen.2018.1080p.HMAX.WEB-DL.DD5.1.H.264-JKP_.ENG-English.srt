I get a phone call,
we're a group of women,

we really wanted to join
Hatzolah for many years, and --

72
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,209
we were also doulas, most of us,

73
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:14,209
and Hatzolah doesn't
want to take us in,

74
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,918
and we were told
that we should really --

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,959
you know, in order to really
get our organization going,

76
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,209
we should really get a woman
lawyer who's going to help us.

- Yeah, I'm a lawyer.

to Hatzolah and I said to them,

"Please take women in."

82

"Oh no," they told me.

83

-No, because they think
that women aren't fast enough,

strong enough, or smart enough.

85

-And they think they're not?

that we agree
not to tape this meeting,

475

"You know something,

than I get here."

to quiet me,
to nip it in the bud,

480
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:28,292
to let me know that I am going
against Da'as Torah, and...

481

they're gonna think,

00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,709
It's amazing.

631
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,876
It's, like, you know,
so totally amazing.

632
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,375
-Oh, my gosh!
-Okay.

633
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:05,334
So, this is the pediatric.

634
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,209
-Peds, okay.
-Yeah.

635
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:09,334
Blood-pressure cuffs,
made three sizes, I got it...

636
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:10,667
-Okay.
-...because I know

637
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:12,167
maybe you didn't understand,

638
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,292
but there are
large people in the world.

639
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,542
-This is a regulator.

640
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:16,375
-Isn't that great?

641
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:18,751
-All right.
-Everything is -- it's --

642
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,209
You'll see.
-All right.

643
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,000
-You were here last week?
No.

644
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,834
You were here last week,
you were here last week.

645
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:34,709
So last week, we spent time
understanding what

646
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:36,667
- the dispatching is all about.
- So, one second.

647
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,751
If you weren't here last week,
then let me just introduce.

648
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:41,500
Rochel was, I mean, like,
the premier dispatcher

649
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,083
for Hatzolah for many,

650
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,584
many, many years.
-Oh, wow.

651
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,334
-Once they --
Once they instituted a policy

652
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:48,542
of no women,
even as dispatchers,

653
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:52,083
Rochel, you know, she agreed
to be our dispatch trainer,

654
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,709
so we're very, very lucky
that Rochel's here.

655
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:58,792
-From here onward.
All right?

656
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,500
Okay. Ding-a-ling-a-ling-
a-ling-a-ling.

657
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,709
"Ezras Nashim.
Do you have an emergency?"

658
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,751
And then what is the most
important piece of information

659
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:08,792
you're going to get once
you know there's an emergency?

660
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,584
Do you recall, those of you
who were here last week?

661
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,375
- The telephone number.
- The telephone number of...?

662
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:16,250
- The person calling.
- The caller. Yes?

663
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:20,167
-I'm only competent in English
and not in any other language.

664
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,584
What about the Yiddish- or
Hebrew-speaking patient who --

665
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:28,042
-Okay, right now
we are not specifying

666
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,709
that anybody needs
more than English.

667
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,417
We are in America.

668
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,834
-Yeah, but you wouldn't know it.
-Yeah.

669
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:51,959
Ambulance?

670
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,876
Ambulance.

671
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:58,334
-No? He says nobody knows
about the women's ambulance.

672
00:41:58,417 --> 00:41:59,876
He said he didn't tell
his friends.

673
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:00,918
Friends?

674
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,125
-They wouldn't believe him.

675
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:09,042
They wouldn't believe him
that there's a women's Hatzolah.

676
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,626
-'Cause they never yet saw
a women's Hatzolah,

677
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:14,834
so they wouldn't believe it.

678
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,959
You believe it?

679
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,250
- Yeah.
- Aww.

680
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:28,042
Hey, where is it?

681
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,375
So, you're going to
stuff the envelopes.

682
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,042
It's returnable to me.

683
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,667
-Yeah.
-So now we're going to do

684
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,834
two boxes that
are going to go to Suri Katz.

685
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:42,542
- She's nuts!
- She almost

686
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,209
Nuts!

687
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:02,667
-Psychology.

688
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:04,000
-Not, like,
to be a pediatrician.

689
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,417
-Psychology.
-No, not psychology.

690
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,167
-Yeah.

-You are listening
to the "Weekly Forum

701
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:09,334
with Bracha Meltzer"
on Chazaq Radio.

702
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:13,417
My guests today are
Ruchie Freier and Yitty Mandel,

703
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,042
the force and pioneers behind
the creation of Ezras Nashim,

704
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,959
the Orthodox women's EMT corps.

705
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:22,667
One of the things
that I want to dispel --

706
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:27,417
people shouldn't think that
Yitty and Ruchie are feminists.

707
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,584
They are very, very, very far
from that,

708
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:32,125
and that was one of the reasons

709
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:35,292
why I was very excited
about interviewing them,

710
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:39,667
knowing that these are frum
women who are living frum lives

711
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:43,375
who are educating their children
to live a Torah life.

712
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:46,125
-And feminism
is a secular concept.

713
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:49,167
If you have a life that's filled
with Torah values,

714
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,751
you don't need feminism.

715
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:55,209
From my perspective,
feminism is the movement

716
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:57,500
when a woman wants
to be equal to a man

717
00:45:57,584 --> 00:45:59,959
or she wants a man's job.

718
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:02,250
I'm very happy with my role
as a woman.

719
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:05,500
And I also think it's important
that your listeners know that

720
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:09,959
we have nothing against women
who go to men doctors.

721
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,250
We're here that if a woman
prefers a woman,

722
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:14,709
she should have that option.

723
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,417
- Exactly.
- And I just think that assisting

724
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,959
a woman in childbirth
really is our role.

725
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,250
-That always belonged
to the women.

726
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:21,876
- Right.
- It was taken away

727
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,751
over the years-- we're just
reclaiming what is ours.

728
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,083
- Let's go!
- Talk to your patient.

729
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,167
-Okay.
-Push!

730
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,959
Give me a good, good push.

731
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:38,042
Mom, you're doing great.
You're doing great.

732
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:39,542
-Okay, three things
that will tell you

733
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:41,083
that this baby is ready
to go on to their mother.

734
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,709
-If the respiration is good,
the color is good,

735
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:46,292
and the -- the --
-The answer I'm looking for

736
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,959
is term, vigorous, and crying.

737
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,834
What we've decided --

738
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:54,542
we needed to make some criteria
to join Ezras Nashim.

739
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:59,375
So, to be an EMT going on calls,
you have to be married.

740
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:02,626
There's a whole host of issues
that come up in a marriage

741
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:06,000
that will give you
that level of maturity.

742
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,959
-We try a posterior?
-Oh, that's a good one.

743
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,334
-Let's try a regular posterior.

744
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:11,083
-That's a good idea.
-Okay.

745
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,918
Having single women
is controversial.

746
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,292
Many of the people
in the community feel

747
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,751
it's not proper.

748
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:21,209
They said to Ruchie, "Maybe
I should rather call Hatzolah

749
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:23,000
and leave things
the way they are.

750
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,709
Maybe we don't need
this organization."

751
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,500
They're not taking any people
who are single,

752
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:32,167
and I think
that's a big mistake.

753
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,000
So if a person
has never been...

754
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,626
in labor and never
delivered a baby,

755
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:36,959
that doesn't mean
that she can't be a good EMT.

756
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:38,667
-'Cause I've never
been in labor...

757
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,125
-But that's the point that
they were making, that, like --

758
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:42,083
-No, no, it wasn't about --
-They were.

759
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,250
-I think it has more to do
with we don't need

760
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:46,000
to give people ammunition
to say,

761
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,459
"Oh, you have these single girls
who should be innocent,

762
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,500
and they're being exposed
to these situations."

763
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:53,250
That's coming not even
necessarily from the ladies.

764
00:47:53,334 --> 00:47:54,709
That's coming straight --
That was...

765
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:58,584
So...

766
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,167
-Times have changed.

767
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,751
You know, I was 22
when I had my third child.

768
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,709
Does that make me
better equipped?

769
00:48:04,792 --> 00:48:07,375
No, I was an idiot.

770
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:10,125
-How old were you
when you had your first?

771
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:13,125
-Almost 19.
-Wow. Just -- wow. Fast.

772
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,709
-So, I was still an idiot.
-Well, yeah.

773
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:30,667
Would you like
to dispatch?

774
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:32,500
So, that would be a great way

775
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:34,751
for you to start to get
involved.

776
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,834
So right now for dispatching
we could use you

777
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,626
and for driving the car.

778
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:46,042
-Okay.

779
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47,584
-Okay?

780
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:01,500
-You're single,
you're out of here.

781
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:03,626
They're saying
it's community standards.

782
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,876
That doesn't make sense.

783
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:10,500
I've been married now
2 1/2 years.

784

I have to get
the final number, but --

802

-Now this -- this agency
has to get up and running,

803

it has to get
on its feet before it --

the rotations is I don't know

how you're going
to actually make people do this.

Coming.

823
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:21,292
-So first thing that
I want to say is

824
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:24,542
as much as you see things,
Ruchie, and you're --

825
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,042
I know you think
things through clearly,

826
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,459
and I'm sure you bounce
things off other people.

827
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,751
You don't always necessarily
see things from the other side.

828
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:34,334
I know you're telling me there
are a lot of happy members,

829
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:36,042
Ruchie, and there probably are,

830
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:39,000
but there are enough members
who are not so happy,

831
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,209
and then we have people
dropping out like flies.

832
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:45,167
-So, I agree with you, and I'd
love to make everybody happy.

833
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,000
But I have to put together
a strong organization.

834
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,626
Does it mean that I want
to be a dictator?

835
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:52,375
-No. No.
-Hey.

836
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:54,751
Ruchie can stay Ruchie,
and she'd better stay Ruchie

837
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:56,250
or we're not going
to have an organization.

838
00:51:56,334 --> 00:51:58,417
But now we have to start walking
that fine line

839
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,209
of making people feel good
about themselves.

840
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,751
So what's the buy-in of
a typical Ezras Nashim member?

841
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:07,751
Salary, there isn't, even
a status within the community?

842
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,709
In the beginning, for sure,
there's not going to be that.

843
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:13,250
What is it? It's doing
the right thing in this time.

844
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:14,959
You know, I feel good being part
of this organization.

845
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,834
That's why I want
to be part of it.

846
00:52:16,918 --> 00:52:20,375
So how are we going to work
with these people to make sure

847
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:23,209
that people feel very connected
to you as a leader?

848
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:25,042
-Okay.

849
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,250

a preschool.

850

This is not. It's not.
It really, really isn't.

852
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,751
You know why?

853
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:36,459

being lambasted

01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:37,417
She's gonna know that
she can be anything

1253
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,125
that she sets her mind to --

1254
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,167
she can be a judge,
she can be a doctor,

1255
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,334
she can be a lawyer,
she can be whatever she wants,

1256
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:47,250
and she doesn't have to
sacrifice her religious beliefs

1257
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:52,000
or her practices in order to do
the things that she dreams of.

-So, people have been calling me
a feminist for many, many years,

1260
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:10,459
and when I started Ezras Nashim,

1261
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:14,959
it was just, like...
blared all over the place.

1262
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:17,292
So, feminism in
the Hasidic community

1263
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,375
has a very negative connotation.

1264
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:23,167
They will view it as a woman
who wants to overstep

1265
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,500
the religious boundaries

1266
01:20:25,584 --> 01:20:28,751
that are set up
between men and women,

1267
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:32,626
and I follow all those
halakic religious boundaries.

1268
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:34,626
Thanks for coming so early.

1269
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:37,417
- Wonderful.
- Okay. What are you...

1270
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,334
But obviously,
I couldn't achieve this position

1271
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:44,500
if the women
who have been trailblazing

1272
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:48,167
for women's equality
hadn't made it possible.

1273
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,083
So my connection
with secular feminism

1274
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:53,500
I think is very obvious.

1275
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:57,167
But you -- you can't just,
in one sentence,

1276
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,125
narrow me down
to a few specific words.

1277
01:21:00,209 --> 01:21:02,250
It just doesn't work with me.
