791
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:13,417
My guests today are
Ruchie Freier and Yitty Mandel,

792
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,042
the force and pioneers behind
the creation of Ezras Nashim,

793
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,959
the Orthodox women's EMT corps.

794
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:22,667
One of the things
that I want to dispel --

795
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:27,417
people shouldn't think that
Yitty and Ruchie are feminists.

796
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,584
They are very, very, very far
from that,

797
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:32,125
and that was one of the reasons

798
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:35,292
why I was very excited
about interviewing them,

799
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:39,667
knowing that these are frum
women who are living frum lives

800
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:43,375
who are educating their children
to live a Torah life.

801
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:46,125
-And feminism
is a secular concept.

802
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:49,167
If you have a life that's filled
with Torah values,

803
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,751
you don't need feminism.

804
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:55,209
From my perspective,
feminism is the movement

805
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:57,500
when a woman wants
to be equal to a man

806
00:45:57,584 --> 00:45:59,959
or she wants a man's job.

807
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:02,250
I'm very happy with my role
as a woman.

808
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:05,500
And I also think it's important
that your listeners know that

809
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:09,959
we have nothing against women
who go to men doctors.

810
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,250
We're here that if a woman
prefers a woman,

811
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:14,709
she should have that option.

812
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,417
-[Yitty] Exactly.
-And I just think that assisting

813
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,959

really is our role.

-[Ruchie] What we've decided --

828
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:54,542
we needed to make some criteria
to join Ezras Nashim.

So, to be an EMT going on calls,
you have to be married.

-So, people have been calling me
a feminist for many, many years,

1429
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:10,459
and when I started Ezras Nashim,

1430
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:14,959
it was just, like...
blared all over the place.

1431
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:17,292
So, feminism in
the Hasidic community

1432
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,375
has a very negative connotation.

1433
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:23,167
They will view it as a woman
who wants to overstep

the religious boundaries

I couldn't achieve this position

hadn't made it possible.
