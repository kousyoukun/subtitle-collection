1
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:18,781
THE DEVIL, PROBABLY

2
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,982
Young man commits
suicide in Pêre-Lachaise

3
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:49,600
Pêre-Lachaise "suicide" was murder

4
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,137
Six months earlier...

5
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,821
Sometimes you shift
your weight to the left

6
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,745
and sometimes to the right.

7
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,528
You end up with this.

8
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:07,661
Show me yours.

9
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:11,588
You don't walk properly.

10
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:14,673
Neither do you.

11
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,031
Nor you.

12
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,450
You do.

13
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:46,508
I proclaim destruction.

14
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,943
Everyone can destroy.

15
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:05,094
It's easy.

16
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:10,180
We can sway hundreds of
thousands of people with slogans.

17
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:16,546
Destroy what? How?

18
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,146
You want to know everything
and end up doing nothing.

19
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:21,706
- What will be left?
- It doesn't matter.

20
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,506
Anything would be an improvement.

21
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,985
If we're going to get done, we want
to know what the point of it is.

22
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,825
The point? There is no point.

23
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,327
Shut up!

24
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,631
Our only strength...

25
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,845
- Our only strength...
- Drop it.

26
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,626
Half-wits, morons.

27
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,865
Idiots, the lot of them.

28
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,786
Let's go. Come on.

29
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:06,713
SOCIETY FOR THE CONSERVATION
OF MAN AND HIS ENVIRONMENT

30
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:31,701
Thousands of dead trees
nearby and all around.

31
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:37,570
X-ray of the legs of a bull
living in the neighbourhood.

32
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,673
Destruction of birds and insects
beneficial to agriculture.

33
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:10,288
Rivers and oceans
contaminated by seepage.

34
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,163
Fixing of poisons in living
organisms, including man.

35
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,643
The threat of prison and
even death won't stop them.

36
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,140
It won't stop these either.

37
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,096
The tankers' effluent.

38
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,194
Aren't they being
threatened with anything?

39
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,178
It's not just the noise.

40
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:08,096
Oxides are released from a height of 15
to 20,000m, destroying the ozone layer.

41
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,748
Once the traffic has doubled,
there'll be no more blue sky.

42
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:26,805
An earth that is ever more
populated and ever less habitable.

43
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:39,950
The destruction of
entire species for profit.

44
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:47,416
280 species of birds and mammals
in about the last hundred years.

45
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:51,861
400,000 elephants and 1,000 rhinoceros
slaughtered in Kenya this year.

46
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,780
180,000 baby seals for $2 million.

47
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,412
- Do you know where you're going?
- Yes.

48
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,012
- Where?
- His place.

49
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:11,320
- He hasn't got one.
- He's got a room.

50
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,582
- You'll break you parents' hearts.
- I can't help that.

51
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,731
Do you love him that much?

52
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,887
You're the one I love, Michel.

53
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,170
With him it's something
else, not true love.

54
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,890
What then?

55
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,022
I don't know. He asked me to
be here at five, so here I am.

56
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,051
He might not come at all.

57
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,949
Here he is.

58
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:59,283
Is it because Luther decided that the Host
is sacred only once it had been swallowed

59
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,083
that you hand it out with unclean hands?

60
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,763
- Unclean?
- Hands not consecrated by priesthood.

61
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:08,083
Montesquieu said Catholicism
would destroy Protestantism

62
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,163
and Catholics would become Protestants.

63
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:11,523
You run after Protestants.

64
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:16,388
Is it because of the opportunities they
offer to live and think as you please?

65
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:25,082
We want to bring
Christianity into modern life.

66
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:29,908
- Why not modern life into Christianity?
- We've had enough of the old ways.

67
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,961
Priests and the faithful search daily...

68
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:58,761
Give us a break from your searching.

69
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:02,400
They meet daily with Protestants
to prepare the church of the future

70
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,237
and build a more logical
form of Christianity.

71
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,760
Logical? Aren't all religions illogical?

72
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,534
That's why, like it or not, Christianity
in the future will be without religion.

73
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,559
You have to evolve, move with the times.

74
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,082
To hell with the times!

75
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:39,199
You're so civilised, so
cultured, you and your bishops.

76
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:42,506
It that why your music is
insipid and your hymns inane?

77
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:49,118
Those words and gestures you've invented
are so insignificant they're humiliating.

78
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,191
God doesn't reveal
himself through mediocrity.

79
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,277
You no longer believe
in the supernatural

80
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:13,917
but give us more than words so we may
share the fate of the poor and oppressed.

81
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:16,157
There is great suffering in the world.

82
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,837
A suburban vicar said to
me yesterday, "I'm bored!"

83
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,536
So are we. Let's go.

84
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,213
What you're making
him do is disgraceful.

85
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,912
What amazes me is how you
can use Edwige like that.

86
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,435
Take her money but leave her alone.

87
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,112
Anyway, she loathes you. What about you?

88
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:57,752
I'm not in the habit of making
my feelings for girls public.

89
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:01,100
What makes you think I
have feelings for her?

90
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,507
Feelings?

91
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,963
- You're leading her on.
- Edwige, is that true?

92
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:14,722
Charles, please, don't
get involved. Leave us be.

93
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,711
Where was I?

94
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:29,870
Accelerate the process of psychological
disintegration already begun...

95
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,401
Already begun, comma, through
books, films and drugs.

96
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,470
Despite appearances, she
has no idea about intimacy.

97
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,469
She'll think you don't love her.

98
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,189
Who says I don't? Now go and hurry back.

99
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,888
I'll bring her to you.

100
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,587
We'll leave.

101
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,825
You want to leave?

102
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:27,662
You won't leave me after
what's about to happen.

103
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:49,073
You know I've only got an hour.

104
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:02,402
What are we waiting for?

105
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,622
Why did you have to make me so happy?

106
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,181
Don't make matters
worse by being stupid.

107
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,581
Poor little Edwige, what
have you done to yourself?

108
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:40,805
What is it to you? You're
not going to cry, too?

109
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:44,101
There's something ridiculous about
you that makes you seem funny.

110
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,258
I'll never stop laughing at you.

111
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,839
I'm going.

112
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,911
It's such a bourgeois idea,
such an outdated prejudice.

113
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,456
Prejudices are never outdated.

114
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,278
You bore me to tears.

115
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,099
I thought if he didn't come
back I'd have to talk to you.

116
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,530
- And did he come back?
- No.

117
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,218
What makes you think he won't come back.

118
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,898
Of course he'll come back.

119
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:38,018
I know you weren't made for each other.

120
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,698
You have nothing in common.

121
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:43,818
That's not true, but I'll be his worst
enemy if I stop him from loving Edwige.

122
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,898
If I was sure he loved her, it
would cost me nothing to decide.

123
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:48,658
I'd make myself scarce.

124
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:53,157
- He wouldn't have that.
- I'd make sure he didn't feel guilty.

125
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:54,977
There is a way.

126
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,722
Stop loving him and love someone else.

127
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,039
Oh, Michel.

128
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:04,949
No, that's not it. If you left him
first, he'd come running after you.

129
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:08,497
Why don't you like him?
You're always putting him down?

130
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:10,379
Me?

131
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:14,836
Look what I found among his things.

132
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:40,052
Cyanide. That's a dreadful poison.

133
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:46,394
There's this, too.

134
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:53,219
Maybe it's to scare
himself, or to scare us.

135
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,774
- Hide it or throw it away.
- He'll notice.

136
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,656
Go on, but not just anywhere.

137
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:18,952
Where's Alberte?

138
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:22,832
What's the matter?

139
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:34,333
- I'll tell you everything.
- Don't tell me anything.

140
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:45,332
- No.
- Yes.

141
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:48,496
- No!
- Just that. Is it right?

142
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:56,321
You should know that the derivative
of log U is prime U over U.

143
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,848
Now go away and don't ever come back.

144
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:47,889
He's there, but he refuses to
give lessons or be paid for them.

145
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,609
He won't do any more.

146
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:50,836
Why?

147
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,408
Is there no limit to doing nothing?

148
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:10,732
Yes, but beyond that you
experience such unheard-of pleasure.

149
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:12,968
What does Alberte say?

150
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:15,528
I haven't asked her. She
doesn't like questions.

151
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:17,328
You treat her appallingly.

152
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:18,791
Are you lecturing me?

153
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,447
Don't go. Stay.

154
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:24,978
Tell me who I love
most, Edwige or Alberte?

155
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:28,995
- You must know better than me.
- I don't know. You decide.

156
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:33,047
- Edwige, obviously.
- You're wrong. It's Alberte.

157
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:36,207
I've told Edwige and
she completely agrees.

158
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:38,364
Suppose you didn't love either of them?

159
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:53,647
He really told me off.

160
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:02,005
- That's not true.
- Please.

161
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,485
Not another word about
me. He'll grow sick of me.

162
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,645
It's a sure way to put him off me.

163
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:09,405
And don't give him a lift.

164
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:12,005
- He's insisting.
- You'll impress him.

165
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,445
But you won't convince him.
You'll only reinforce his ideas.

166
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:17,144
Are you coming?

167
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:24,324
- Did you destroy the bottle?
- Yes.

168
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,481
- Did he notice?
- Of course.

169
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,962
Your new roads pass through wood pulp?

170
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,973
They must be felled. They're seedlings.

171
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,158
SAVE OUR PLANET

172
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:40,538
Do you know how civilisations end?

173
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:43,784
It's when stupidity is accelerated.

174
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,894
Growth. Growth of what? Of happiness?

175
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,437
Happiness on credit, the credit card?

176
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:01,988
Or the happiness of walking in the
country and diving into a river?

177
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:11,536
All this is pretty much above board.

178
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:14,266
Red mud.

179
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:37,395
For years 2,000 tons of sulphuric
acid, titanium and cadmium

180
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,395
dumped in the Mediterranean every day.

181
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,468
Dumping it on the seabed is no better.

182
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:55,063
Mercury waste thrown into the sea
passed on to humans through fish.

183
00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:59,779
These pictures can't be shown too often.

184
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:31,429
15 years to react.

185
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:43,416
1 to 2% of world tonnage spread
along the coast and in the oceans.

186
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:04,908
Giant tankers are still being launched.

187
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,710
It's up to science to save us.

188
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,470
We'll end up simply
waving our limbs about

189
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,230
and eating cakes, completely mad.

190
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,310
Do you want to go back
to living in caves?

191
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,689
I ask for nothing, I
lay claim to nothing.

192
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,069
No, you want to be an exceptional
guy in an exceptional world.

193
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,906
What about you? What
do you stand for? Well?

194
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,829
Progress, brotherly love, love?

195
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,056
And you?

196
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,909
Me? Unbridled pleasure.

197
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:47,532
Making love like a beast, a wild animal.

198
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,602
- Where are you going?
- There.

199
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,007
Do you know her?

200
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:23,024
What's wrong with you? Open the door!

201
00:31:43,556 --> 00:31:45,440
Open the door!

202
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:55,136
I was so frightened. What happened?

203
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,905
You can't rest your head underwater,
as if on a pillow, and wait.

204
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:08,505
It's not possible.

205
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,303
- Wait for what?
- I don't know.

206
00:32:13,754 --> 00:32:15,304
This?

207
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,344
Idiot.

208
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,378
Do you know what trouble
you could get me into?

209
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:01,273
Idiot.

210
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,577
Do you think I could kill myself?

211
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,620
- Not for a moment.
- Why?

212
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,100
Because if we were really
done for, as you say we are,

213
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,926
if there really was no hope, I'd still
want to live in spite of everything.

214
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,020
Without thinking, just
for the sake of it?

215
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,032
Living for the life force.

216
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:59,979
But I'm certain everything will be OK.

217
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,206
Certain?

218
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:04,619
Not through reason or intelligence.

219
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,364
- Something else.
- You're right.

220
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,540
Look what someone gave me.

221
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:14,258
Chocolates?

222
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,937
Don't worry, I don't need anything.

223
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:50,926
When I'm hungry, I get what I need
from home when there's no one there.

224
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:52,520
I've got the keys.

225
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:04,755
Isn't Charles here?

226
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:09,496
He might be angry with me
about the day before yesterday.

227
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,417
He hasn't been back since.

228
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,256
- Did you fight?
- No.

229
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,496
But I let him know I was sad.

230
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,655
He spoke to me gently but his
voice was so dry, almost polite,

231
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:20,895
that I froze.

232
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,295
Usually it's me comforting him.

233
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:25,455
Have you heard the news?

234
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:28,775
He's going to stay with
Edwige while her Dad's away.

235
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,615
I know he wants to.

236
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:33,615
Don't get annoyed. He'll
be better off with her.

237
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:36,975
But I daren't encourage him
or he'll insist on staying.

238
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:39,854
I don't want him to be
stuck here out of duty.

239
00:35:39,944 --> 00:35:42,691
That would kill off any
love he had left for me.

240
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:45,810
Can you believe he brought me these?

241
00:35:55,624 --> 00:35:57,233
Do you want one?

242
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,771
Are you mad? What's
got into you? Tell me.

243
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:20,612
I knew you needed me.

244
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:22,572
Yes, I need you, Michel.

245
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:25,645
But not today. I'd
rather be alone today.

246
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,129
It's awful seeing you here.

247
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:48,612
Come on, let's go out.

248
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,330
If my book's here, it's a bad sign.

249
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,530
It means it's not having
the effect I intended.

250
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,228
He thinks it's great.

251
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:29,689
- How do you know?
- He told me.

252
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:33,220
I think he's trying to please
you. He knows we're friends.

253
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:51,088
He keeps it hidden. I prefer that.

254
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:53,928
He's two-faced. Come the revolution...

255
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:56,168
- There won't be any revolution.
- Why?

256
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:59,888
- It's too late.
- If you say so.

257
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:03,013
- You said so yourself the other day.
- I did?

258
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,320
- It's tempting.
- What?

259
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,547
Nothing.

260
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,480
Can I borrow it?

261
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,080
I'll sell it to you.
I've got another one.

262
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,360
Put it down.

263
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:12,426
Is it your gun that Charles has got?

264
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,275
- He stared at the bullet in his hand.
- The bullet?

265
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:23,193
He probably wants a good look
before he puts a bullet in his head.

266
00:42:37,444 --> 00:42:38,765
Charles!

267
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:44,737
He was here.

268
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:47,017
Charles!

269
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:23,073
Aren't you worried?

270
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,296
May I?

271
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,949
- You're shivering.
- No.

272
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,716
Yes, you are. Come
on. Let's warm you up.

273
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:45,687
Here, drink this.

274
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:53,486
I'm out of here.

275
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:55,974
Go on then.

276
00:45:30,476 --> 00:45:33,184
All right? Am I late?

277
00:45:34,196 --> 00:45:35,478
Alberte?

278
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,944
I prayed that you'd come back to life

279
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:21,114
so that I could hold you in my
arms again and kiss you like before?

280
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:35,383
Was I dead?

281
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:36,543
Then I woke up

282
00:46:36,633 --> 00:46:39,759
to find you close to
me. It feels so good.

283
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:43,036
You know I'll never leave you.

284
00:46:50,272 --> 00:46:52,222
Yes, I'm getting married.

285
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:54,942
- To Edwige?
- To Alberte.

286
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:57,302
- It's the only solution.
- Do you really think so?

287
00:46:57,392 --> 00:46:59,956
- There is no other.
- Here it comes.

288
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:02,302
- I'll come with you.
- No, don't.

289
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:47,379
Hasn't the acceptable dose for
humans been rather hastily assessed?

290
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,078
I don't think so.

291
00:47:50,229 --> 00:47:51,969
It's 0. 17 rem.

292
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:59,008
A rem is the effect produced on
the organism by 1 rad of radiation.

293
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:02,672
A rad is equivalent
to 100 ergs per gram.

294
00:48:08,828 --> 00:48:10,578
Do nuclear power stations,

295
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:13,298
apart from permanently
destroying rivers,

296
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:16,973
preclude any threat of
radioactivity to the population?

297
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:22,103
If the precautions are insufficient,
we'll adopt more as we go along.

298
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:38,085
The gases given off are
mainly krypton and tritium.

299
00:48:42,906 --> 00:48:46,399
They require processing plants
and waste has to be stored.

300
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:49,930
Isn't there a risk in
transporting that waste?

301
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:54,056
Trains carrying uranium were derailed,
one in the US and another in Germany.

302
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:56,576
- The containers remained intact.
- That was lucky.

303
00:48:56,666 --> 00:49:01,056
Plutonium is more dangerous than
uranium. It lasts indefinitely.

304
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,128
Isn't the danger increased
by road transportation?

305
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:08,638
The engineers and technicians
are handling that problem.

306
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:14,855
Once stored, doesn't the waste
threaten to contaminate drinking water?

307
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:18,375
The earth's drinking water is comparable
to a drop of water on an orange.

308
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:21,375
Has the possibility of
earthquakes been considered?

309
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:23,614
And doesn't dumping
the waste in the sea,

310
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:26,254
as we have become accustomed to doing,

311
00:49:26,344 --> 00:49:29,214
mean the total destruction

312
00:49:29,304 --> 00:49:31,454
of marine flora and fauna?

313
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:34,174
Never mind. It's the future
generations who'll pay.

314
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,134
The United States are planning

315
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:38,774
to build 1,000 nuclear power stations.

316
00:49:38,864 --> 00:49:41,454
It is thought that the
USSR will build double that.

317
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:46,093
And you're not terrified by the sudden
proliferation of these power stations?

318
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,533
No, not at all.

319
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:51,813
Why the atom and not solar energy
or tidal power, for example?

320
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:53,093
Whose choice is it?

321
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:56,453
It's mainly dictated by the work on
armaments and new types of weapons.

322
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,733
The masterpiece is a
thermonuclear missile

323
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:01,806
that will kill 20 million
men, women and children.

324
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:12,772
What's incredible is that to reassure
people you simply have to deny the facts.

325
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:16,092
What facts? This is the
supernatural. Nothing is clear.

326
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:17,791
You're unbelievable!

327
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:23,221
BUS STOPPING

328
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,930
Governments are short-sighted.

329
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,370
Don't accuse governments.

330
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,530
No government in the world today can
boast that it's actually governing.

331
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,570
It's the masses who determine events.

332
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,490
Obscure forces whose
laws are unfathomable.

333
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,369
It's true that something is
driving us against our will.

334
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,409
You have to go along with it.

335
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:11,207
And we do go along with it.

336
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,689
Who is it that is making
a mockery of humanity?

337
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:16,369
Whose leading us by the nose?

338
00:51:16,459 --> 00:51:18,107
The devil, probably.

339
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:06,073
NO BATHING

340
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:17,785
Do you find her selfish?

341
00:52:18,896 --> 00:52:20,686
She lets me go, then she's sad.

342
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:23,066
It's worse than if she hadn't let me go.

343
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:32,605
- Do you love him very much?
- Yes.

344
00:52:32,695 --> 00:52:33,845
In that case...

345
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:35,525
What?

346
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:38,125
- Do you want him to be happy?
- Yes, of course.

347
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:40,405
If it seems he'd be happier with you...

348
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:43,060
Perhaps I'm not the
person to say this...

349
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,185
It's all decided as you well know.

350
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,244
What's decided?

351
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:55,244
Leave us alone and don't get cross.

352
00:52:55,334 --> 00:52:56,943
You stay.

353
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:03,404
- Did he tell you we were getting married?
- Yes.

354
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:06,084
He told me too, but it's just for show.

355
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:08,920
- It calms him down.
- That's what I thought.

356
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,157
He's caught a live fish.

357
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,480
Quick, let's hide.

358
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:13,127
<i>We've arrested one
person.</i> <i>Keep us posted.</i>

359
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,157
I've been told everything

360
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:33,196
and I thought I should come and see you

361
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:35,353
in view of my interest in you.

362
00:55:37,606 --> 00:55:39,896
I hope you'll let me come back.

363
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:43,156
You must not doubt my sincerity.

364
00:55:43,246 --> 00:55:45,116
What will you do?

365
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:47,496
Make it up with your parents?

366
00:55:48,566 --> 00:55:50,175
Go home?

367
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:53,850
Return to what made you
leave in the first place?

368
00:55:55,925 --> 00:55:57,992
Or hang on to your freedom?

369
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:02,075
I can get you a good
position with a colleague

370
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:04,455
or with me at the bookshop.

371
00:56:05,925 --> 00:56:08,195
You'll never find a
better friend than me.

372
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,352
Let me prove it to you.

373
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:13,395
Get away.

374
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:15,551
Take your money and get lost!

375
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:21,502
You're making a mistake.
I'm offering you protection.

376
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,921
- What happened?
- Nothing at all.

377
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:50,674
Why have you come?

378
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:57,472
All I've got left

379
00:56:57,562 --> 00:56:59,152
is an old sweater

380
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:02,225
and the Coke bottles to take back.

381
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:10,272
- There's no more love.
- You didn't love him.

382
00:57:10,362 --> 00:57:13,872
Or you only loved him so you
could be generous and forgiving.

383
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,752
He wasn't unfaithful.

384
00:57:15,842 --> 00:57:17,831
He didn't know he
loved me no more.

385
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:20,865
You were only jealous when he was away.

386
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:23,507
Leave me alone. Go away.

387
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:31,322
You're going to make
me leave, go back home.

388
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,991
I don't want to, do you hear?

389
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:36,689
Go away, please.

390
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,128
Are you there?

391
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:16,543
It's Valentin, he's
back on drugs. Quick.

392
00:59:39,915 --> 00:59:41,523
Are you hungry?

393
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:50,937
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

394
01:00:11,913 --> 01:00:15,023
He says he has plenty of
places he can go but he's lying.

395
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,263
He's safe here in the meantime.

396
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:20,663
Lock him in if necessary. I'll be back.

397
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,881
- Don't go right away.
- I'm in a hurry.

398
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:31,318
No, leave that.

399
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:39,339
You should go to bed now.

400
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:43,562
Go to bed? Yes, I'm going
to bed. Straight to bed.

401
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:05,244
Here.

402
01:03:45,063 --> 01:03:47,129
People here say you're mad too.

403
01:04:20,141 --> 01:04:23,691
Victor Hugo says here, on
the subject of cathedrals,

404
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:26,071
"Such places are really holy."

405
01:04:27,821 --> 01:04:29,490
But somewhere else he says,

406
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,850
"A cathedral is divine. God is present.

407
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,010
"But if a priest appears
God is no longer present."

408
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,417
- That's going too far, don't you think?
- Me and God, you know...

409
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,410
You're still going,
we're going together.

410
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,970
On one condition.

411
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,127
All right.

412
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:33,636
I'm noting down that you deny any
part in breaking open the boxes

413
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:35,916
or any part in the theft.

414
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:36,955
Go ahead.

415
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:39,792
- And yet you weren't alone.
- True.

416
01:09:41,205 --> 01:09:44,149
A second sleeping bag is proof of that.

417
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:47,875
- Who was he?
- I don't know his name.

418
01:09:47,965 --> 01:09:51,864
He escaped through the open
doors. He fled. He's far away.

419
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:54,254
What about the leaflets?

420
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:57,355
I found them on the
chairs when I arrived.

421
01:09:57,445 --> 01:10:02,794
I suppose you deny you intended to distribute
them like in St Bernard's the other night?

422
01:10:02,884 --> 01:10:04,314
You're very clever

423
01:10:04,404 --> 01:10:07,314
but if I'd wanted to hand these
leaflets out in the church,

424
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:11,194
I wouldn't have been screwing
them up to make them unreadable

425
01:10:11,284 --> 01:10:15,784
and put them in the state they were
in when you found them in my pockets.

426
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:20,423
Can you explain what you were doing in
St Rémy church with that record player?

427
01:10:23,443 --> 01:10:25,193
Do you refuse to answer?

428
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:28,816
No, but you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

429
01:10:33,243 --> 01:10:34,852
Answer!

430
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,912
You must understand that I
don't want your attention.

431
01:10:43,002 --> 01:10:44,833
I need to be left alone.

432
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:52,152
That stupid business has shaken him up.

433
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:55,032
He hasn't even thought of
getting up since yesterday.

434
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:58,512
Only a great analyst like
Dr Mime can make him better.

435
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:02,042
- How do we get him to accept that?
- I have some addresses.

436
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:20,670
Yes, I've forgiven him.

437
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,050
But will you ever forgive me, Michel?

438
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,027
I've been awful to you.

439
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,950
I want to know what's
going on in that heart.

440
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,505
Kiss me.

441
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:50,829
He has fled from his bed.

442
01:11:50,919 --> 01:11:52,629
- When?
- I don't know.

443
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:55,349
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

444
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:56,812
Quickly, let's go.

445
01:12:28,237 --> 01:12:31,272
How did this clash with society arise?

446
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:33,467
It's my normal state.

447
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,867
I've kept it quiet for a long time.

448
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:38,848
Don't you get pleasure from non-action?

449
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:43,544
Yes, but the pleasure
of despair, obviously.

450
01:12:44,116 --> 01:12:46,066
- Do you feel guilty?
- Guilty?

451
01:12:46,156 --> 01:12:47,477
Towards yourself?

452
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:53,186
Guilty without being so. I know I'm
more intelligent than the others.

453
01:12:53,276 --> 01:12:55,786
I'm perfectly aware of my superiority.

454
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,626
But if I did anything,

455
01:12:57,716 --> 01:13:01,306
then I'd be useful, even in some
small way, in a world that disgusts me.

456
01:13:01,396 --> 01:13:04,945
I'd betray my ideas. It would
only entrench me further.

457
01:13:05,035 --> 01:13:07,785
I prefer to know that
there's no way out.

458
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:12,065
Isn't begging in the streets, as I've
seen people like you do, a bit degrading?

459
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:15,596
Charity degrades the donor
as much as the recipient.

460
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:19,965
Isn't that a good excuse for laziness?

461
01:13:20,555 --> 01:13:23,145
Perhaps, but so what?

462
01:13:23,235 --> 01:13:27,407
If my aim was money and profit
everyone would respect me.

463
01:14:00,313 --> 01:14:03,479
Isn't being right
compensation for being alive?

464
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:06,499
In losing my life, here's what I'd lose.

465
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:17,182
Family planning, package holidays
- cultural, sporting, linguistic.

466
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:18,982
The cultivated man's library.

467
01:14:19,072 --> 01:14:21,422
All sports. How to adopt a child.

468
01:14:21,512 --> 01:14:23,262
Parent-teacher associations.

469
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:28,021
Education. Teaching 0 to 4 years,
7 to 14 years, 14 to 17 years.

470
01:14:28,111 --> 01:14:29,741
Preparation for marriage.

471
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:32,741
Military duties. Europe.

472
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,941
Decorations
- honorary insignia.

473
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:38,421
The single woman. Paid sick
leave, unpaid sick leave.

474
01:14:38,511 --> 01:14:41,461
The successful man. Tax
benefits for the elderly.

475
01:14:41,551 --> 01:14:43,341
Local taxes.

476
01:14:43,431 --> 01:14:46,660
Hire purchase. Radio
and television rentals.

477
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,460
Credit cards. Home repairs.

478
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:53,174
Index-linking. VAT and consumers.

479
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:01,148
Do you believe in God?

480
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,300
I believe, so far as
possible, in everlasting life.

481
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:07,619
But if I commit suicide, I
can't think I'd be condemned

482
01:15:07,709 --> 01:15:11,019
for not comprehending
the incomprehensible.

483
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:14,433
How long have you been
thinking about death for?

484
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:31,978
He's there. All is well.

485
01:15:32,068 --> 01:15:33,716
- All is well?
- Yes.

486
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:45,298
Often in my sleep I see
myself murdered, dead.

487
01:15:45,388 --> 01:15:47,378
But I go on being hit.

488
01:15:47,467 --> 01:15:50,217
I'm being trampled. It's awful.

489
01:15:50,307 --> 01:15:52,017
All that for a holy cause.

490
01:15:52,107 --> 01:15:55,017
Once the dream is over,
do you feel like a martyr?

491
01:15:55,107 --> 01:15:56,777
Only an amateur.

492
01:15:56,867 --> 01:15:59,737
When I wanted to drown myself
in the bath, or pull the trigger,

493
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:02,208
I was well aware of how hard it was.

494
01:16:03,147 --> 01:16:05,437
Is your father in your dreams?

495
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:07,697
It's not very clear.

496
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:09,096
What does he do?

497
01:16:09,186 --> 01:16:12,856
He's a provincial property developer,
or a contractor. I'm not really sure.

498
01:16:12,946 --> 01:16:15,816
He's rich. He pulls
down trees with machines.

499
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:19,536
A new upsurge of libido
in our western world

500
01:16:19,626 --> 01:16:24,056
might bring a destructive counterforce
for people in your father's profession.

501
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,702
What about your mother?

502
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:29,620
The richer he gets,
the more she loves him.

503
01:16:30,945 --> 01:16:32,495
Do you make love often?

504
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:35,695
Often. It puts me in touch
with my emotions, my feelings.

505
01:16:35,785 --> 01:16:40,927
In your sexual relations, are you
aware of your fiancée's bodily needs?

506
01:16:41,745 --> 01:16:43,415
We don't have relations any more.

507
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:46,015
She was good in bed. I
thought that was love.

508
01:16:46,105 --> 01:16:48,670
I've lost a wonderful girl.

509
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:51,534
When did you stop studying?

510
01:16:51,624 --> 01:16:56,054
After higher maths. I organised
a sixth form cell at school.

511
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:59,951
And now you belong to left-wing groups?

512
01:17:00,104 --> 01:17:02,171
Yes. Or rather, no.

513
01:17:02,944 --> 01:17:05,454
No more politics in your life?

514
01:17:05,544 --> 01:17:07,834
The rejection of all politics.

515
01:17:18,703 --> 01:17:21,533
- Do you have any problem eating?
- Sometimes.

516
01:17:21,623 --> 01:17:25,247
- I mean an aversion to food?
- Not at all.

517
01:17:25,703 --> 01:17:28,921
Loss of appetite often
accompanies severe depression.

518
01:17:29,903 --> 01:17:31,652
I'm not depressed.

519
01:17:31,742 --> 01:17:34,772
I just want the right to be myself.

520
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:36,852
I don't want to be
forced to give up wanting,

521
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:42,572
to replace my true desires with
false statistics, surveys, formulae,

522
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:45,892
ultra-stupid American-Russian
scientific classifications.

523
01:17:45,982 --> 01:17:48,598
I don't want to be a
slave or a specialist.

524
01:17:49,062 --> 01:17:51,811
Were you beaten as a
child? Try to remember.

525
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,510
I was spanked.

526
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:59,171
Do you know that the feeling of being
crushed by the society you live in

527
01:17:59,261 --> 01:18:03,771
might well be the result of
that spanking you got as a child?

528
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:07,371
That, together with the painful dream
of being murdered for a good cause,

529
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:11,131
would point to the development
of psychomotor symptoms

530
01:18:11,221 --> 01:18:15,354
and explain the root of your
disgust and your wish to die.

531
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,971
But I don't want to die.

532
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,651
What? Of course you do.

533
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:27,041
I hate life but I hate death
too. I find it appalling.

534
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,808
Look, leave it to me.

535
01:18:33,019 --> 01:18:36,786
Come back in two days.
Thursday, same time.

536
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:41,073
But Doctor, I'm not ill. My
illness is seeing too clearly.

537
01:18:41,339 --> 01:18:45,016
Of course. It's 200 francs a session.

538
01:19:10,858 --> 01:19:11,995
Doctor.

539
01:19:16,697 --> 01:19:19,327
- I don't think I'll ever be able to...
- Pay?

540
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:24,287
Do the deed. To think I would suddenly
stop thinking, seeing, hearing.

541
01:19:24,377 --> 01:19:30,029
That's why the ancient Romans entrusted
a servant or friend with the task.

542
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:42,487
- He's saved
- Do you think so?

543
01:20:22,574 --> 01:20:23,764
Edwige?

544
01:21:31,611 --> 01:21:34,601
I know he has one to sell.

545
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:36,300
What if he refuses?

546
01:21:36,931 --> 01:21:39,220
He won't. Give him this.

547
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,401
What do you need it for?

548
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:49,051
You'll see. Just don't
tell him it's for me.

549
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,920
But look...

550
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,894
Go on. I'll wait for you here.

551
01:23:09,606 --> 01:23:10,556
And the bullets?

552
01:23:10,646 --> 01:23:12,530
It's loaded.

553
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:16,143
Farewell.

554
01:23:46,644 --> 01:23:48,475
Will you do me a favour?

555
01:23:49,564 --> 01:23:50,701
No.

556
01:23:51,964 --> 01:23:54,802
Worthy of the ancient Romans.

557
01:23:56,924 --> 01:23:58,755
What ancient Romans?

558
01:23:59,884 --> 01:24:01,021
Look.

559
01:24:01,923 --> 01:24:04,488
That's all for you if you do as I ask.

560
01:24:06,843 --> 01:24:07,980
What?

561
01:24:11,763 --> 01:24:14,601
I'll tell you later.
Come with me for now.

562
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:29,778
I'll wait downstairs. Hurry.

563
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:37,965
Are you all right?

564
01:26:40,356 --> 01:26:42,240
Let's get some air. Come on.

565
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,619
We're stopping here. Follow me.

566
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:13,969
A tot of something
strong, anything, brandy.

567
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:16,480
What about you?

568
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:18,328
Nothing.

569
01:28:59,469 --> 01:29:00,606
Let's go.

570
01:29:14,988 --> 01:29:16,597
Can't you wait?

571
01:30:58,223 --> 01:30:59,832
Where are we going?

572
01:31:00,903 --> 01:31:03,336
Wherever you like. Here or there?

573
01:31:34,062 --> 01:31:37,554
I thought at a time like this
I'd have sublime thoughts.

574
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:46,397
Shall I tell you?
