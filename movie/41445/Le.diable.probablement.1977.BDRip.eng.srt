1
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:06,221
THE DEVIL, PROBABLY

2
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:33,689
Young man commits suicide
in Pиre-Lachaise

3
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:42,573
Pиre-Lachaise "suicide" was murder

4
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,287
Six months earlier...

5
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,086
Sometimes you shift your weight to the left

6
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,788
and sometimes to the right.

7
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,715
You end up with this.

8
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,139
Show me yours.

9
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,227
You don't walk properly.

10
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,438
Neither do you.

11
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,937
Nor you.

12
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,475
You do.

13
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,547
I proclaim destruction.

14
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,476
Everyone can destroy.

15
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,022
It's easy.

16
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,987
We can sway hundreds of thousands of people
with slogans.

17
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,162
Destroy what? How?

18
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,881
You want to know everything
and end up doing nothing.

19
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,545
- What will be left?
- It doesn't matter.

20
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,420
Anything would be an improvement.

21
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,052
If we're going to get done,
we want to know what the point of it is.

22
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,972
The point? There is no point.

23
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,297
Shut up!

24
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,680
Our only strength...

25
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,974
- Our only strength...
- Drop it.

26
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,936
Half-wits, morons.

27
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,614
Idiots, the lot of them.

28
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,316
Let's go. Come on.

29
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,755
SOCIETY FOR THE CONSERVATION
OF MAN AND HIS ENVIRONMENT

30
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,032
Thousands of dead trees
nearby and all around.

31
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,169
X-ray of the legs of a bull
living in the neighbourhood.

32
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,977
Destruction of birds and insects
beneficial to agriculture.

33
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,281
Rivers and oceans
contaminated by seepage.

34
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,326
Fixing of poisons
in living organisms, including man.

35
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,040
The threat of prison and even death
won't stop them.

36
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,390
It won't stop these either.

37
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,525
The tankers' effluent.

38
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,901
Aren't they being threatened with anything?

39
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,923
It's not just the noise.

40
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,347
Oxides are released from a height
of 15 to 20 km, destroying the ozone layer.

41
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,472
Once the traffic has doubled,
there'll be no more blue sky.

42
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,075
An earth that is ever more populated
and ever less habitable.

43
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,877
The destruction of entire species
for profit.

44
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,048
280 species of birds and mammals
in about the last hundred years.

45
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,048
400,000 elephants and 1,000 rhinoceros
slaughtered in Kenya this year.

46
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,528
180,000 baby seals for $2 million.

47
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,420
- Do you know where you're going?
- Yes.

48
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,097
- Where?
- His place.

49
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,058
- He hasn't got one.
- He's got a room.

50
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,730
- You'll break your parents' hearts.
- I can't help that.

51
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,865
Do you love him that much?

52
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,790
You're the one I love, Michel.

53
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,539
With him it's something else,
not true love.

54
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,332
What then?

55
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,631
I don't know.

56
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,048
He asked me to be
here at five, so here I am.

57
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,549
He might not come at all.

58
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,601
Here he is.

59
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:15,692
Is it because Luther decided that the Host
is sacred only once it had been swallowed

60
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,563
that you hand it out with unclean hands?

61
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,397
- Unclean?
- Hands not consecrated by priesthood.

62
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,866
Montesquieu said
Catholicism would destroy Protestantism

63
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,035
and Catholics would become Protestants.

64
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,456
You run after Protestants.

65
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,828
Because of the opportunities they offer
for living and thinking as you please?

66
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,593
We want to bring Christianity
into modern life.

67
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,932
- Why not modern life into Christianity?
- We've had enough of the old ways.

68
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,790
Priests and the faithful search daily...

69
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,707
Give us a break from your searching.

70
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,505
They meet daily with Protestants
to prepare the church of the future

71
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,043
and build a more logical form
of Christianity.

72
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,306
Logical?
Aren't all religions illogical?

73
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,352
That's why, like it or not,

74
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,601
the Christianity of the future will
be without religion.

75
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,734
You have to evolve,
move with the times.

76
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,993
To hell with the times!

77
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,880
You're so civilised, so cultured,
you and your bishops.

78
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,841
Is that why your music is insipid
and your hymns inane?

79
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,096
All those words and
gestures you've invented

80
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,216
are so insignificant,
they're humiliating.

81
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,972
God doesn't reveal himself
through mediocrity.

82
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,284
You no longer believe in the supernatural

83
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,079
but give us more than words so we may share
the fate of the poor and oppressed.

84
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,415
There is great suffering in the world.

85
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,214
A suburban vicar
said to me yesterday, "I'm bored!"

86
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,715
So are we. Let's go.

87
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,706
What you're making him do is disgraceful.

88
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,130
What amazes me is
how you can use Edwige like that.

89
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,390
Take her money but leave her alone.

90
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,559
Anyway, she loathes you. What about you?

91
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,354
I'm not in the habit of making
my feelings for girls public.

92
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,355
What makes you think
I have feelings for her?

93
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,152
Feelings?

94
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,535
- You're leading her on.
- Edwige, is that true?

95
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,535
Charles, please, don't get involved.
Leave us be.

96
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,506
Where was I?

97
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,849
Accelerate the process of psychological
disintegration already begun...

98
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,013
Already begun, comma,
through books, films and drugs.

99
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,115
Despite appearances,
she has no idea about intimacy.

100
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,199
She'll think you don't love her.

101
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,032
Who says I don't?
Now go and hurry back.

102
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,540
I'll bring her to you.

103
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,091
We'll leave.

104
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,720
You want to leave?

105
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,254
You won't leave me
after what's about to happen.

106
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,573
You know I've only got an hour.

107
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,634
What are we waiting for?

108
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,325
Why did you have to make me so happy?

109
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,994
Don't make matters worse by being stupid.

110
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,542
Poor little Edwige,
what have you done to yourself?

111
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,336
What is it to you?
You're not going to cry, too?

112
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,377
There's something ridiculous about you
that makes you seem funny.

113
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,302
I'll never stop laughing at you.

114
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,655
I'm going.

115
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,823
It's such a bourgeois idea,
such an outdated prejudice.

116
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,664
Prejudices are never outdated.

117
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,669
You bore me to tears.

118
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,298
I thought if he didn't come back
I'd have to talk to you.

119
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,473
- And did he come back?
- No.

120
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,643
What makes you think he won't come back.

121
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,397
Of course he'll come back.

122
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,599
I know you weren't made for each other.

123
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,359
You have nothing in common.

124
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,423
That's not true,

125
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,650
but I'll be his worst enemy
if I stop him from loving Edwige.

126
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,866
If I was sure he loved her,
it would cost me nothing to decide.

127
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,702
I'd make myself scarce.

128
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,744
- He wouldn't have that.
- I'd make sure he didn't feel guilty.

129
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,288
There is a way.

130
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,743
Stop loving him and love someone else.

131
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,328
Oh, Michel.

132
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,090
No, that's not it. If you left him first,
he'd come running after you.

133
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,388
Why don't you like him?
You're always putting him down.

134
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,058
Me?

135
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,638
Look what I found among his things.

136
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,871
Cyanide. That's a dreadful poison.

137
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,638
There's this, too.

138
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,555
Maybe it's to scare himself,
or to scare us.

139
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,031
- Hide it or throw it away.
- He'll notice.

140
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,699
Go on, but not just anywhere.

141
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,589
Where's Alberte?

142
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,634
What's the matter?

143
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,395
- I'll tell you everything.
- Don't tell me anything.

144
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,359
- No.
- Yes.

145
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,196
- No!
- Just that. Is it right?

146
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,249
You should know that the derivative
of log U is U prime over U.

147
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,897
Now go away
and don't ever come back.

148
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:34,596
He's there, but he refuses
to give lessons or be paid for them.

149
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,384
He won't do any more.

150
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,466
Why?

151
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,862
Is there no limit to doing nothing?

152
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:57,654
Yes, but beyond that
you experience such unheard-of pleasure.

153
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,749
What does Alberte say?

154
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,413
I haven't asked her.
She doesn't like questions.

155
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,288
You treat her appallingly.

156
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,583
Are you lecturing me?

157
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,582
Don't go. Stay.

158
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,754
Tell me who I love most,
Edwige or Alberte?

159
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,968
- You must know better than me.
- I don't know. You decide.

160
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,684
- Edwige, obviously.
- You're wrong. It's Alberte.

161
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,980
I've told Edwige and she completely agrees.

162
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,898
Suppose you didn't love either of them?

163
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,867
He really told me off.

164
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,874
- That's not true.
- Please.

165
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,509
Not another word about me.
He'll grow sick of me.

166
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,761
It's a sure way to put him off me.

167
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,599
And don't give him a lift.

168
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,311
- He's insisting.
- You'll impress him.

169
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,888
But you won't convince him.
You'll only reinforce his ideas.

170
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,399
Are you coming?

171
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,153
- Did you destroy the bottle?
- Yes.

172
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,073
- Did he notice?
- Of course.

173
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,887
Your new roads pass through wood pulp?

174
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,014
They must be felled.
They're seedlings.

175
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,709
SAVE OUR PLANET

176
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,832
Do you know how civilisations end?

177
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,173
It's when stupidity is accelerated.

178
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,603
Growth. Growth of what?
Of happiness?

179
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,815
Happiness on credit,
the credit card?

180
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,904
Or the happiness of walking in the country
and diving into a river?

181
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,156
All this is pretty much above board.

182
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,077
Red mud.

183
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,474
For years, 2,000 tons of sulphuric acid,
titanium and cadmium

184
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,565
dumped in the Mediterranean every day.

185
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,316
Dumping it on the seabed is no better.

186
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,325
Mercury waste thrown into the sea
passed on to humans through fish.

187
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,412
These pictures can't be shown too often.

188
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,495
15 years to react.

189
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,714
1 to 2% of world tonnage
spread along the coast and in the oceans.

190
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,313
Giant tankers are still being launched.

191
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,211
It's up to science to save us.

192
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,094
We'll end up simply waving our limbs about

193
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,971
and eating cakes, completely mad.

194
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,137
Do you want to go back to living in caves?

195
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,259
I ask for nothing,
I lay claim to nothing.

196
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,145
No, you want to be an exceptional guy
in an exceptional world.

197
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,680
What about you?
What do you stand for? Well?

198
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,147
Progress, brotherly love, love?

199
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,226
And you?

200
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,403
Me? Unbridled pleasure.

201
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,651
Making love like a beast, a wild animal.

202
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,163
- Where are you going?
- There.

203
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,880
Do you know her?

204
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,770
What's wrong with you?
Open the door!

205
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,261
Open the door!

206
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,311
I was so frightened.
What happened?

207
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,941
You can't rest your head underwater,
as if on a pillow, and wait.

208
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,619
It's not possible.

209
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,118
- Wait for what?
- I don't know.

210
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,703
This?

211
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,784
Idiot.

212
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,506
Do you know
what trouble you could get me into?

213
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,414
Idiot.

214
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,254
Do you think I could kill myself?

215
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,800
- Not for a moment.
- Why?

216
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,383
Because if we were really done for,
as you say we are,

217
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,325
if there really was no hope,

218
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:02,725
I'd still want to live
in spite of everything.

219
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,683
Without thinking,
just for the sake of it?

220
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,475
Living for the life force.

221
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,850
But I'm certain everything will be OK.

222
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,935
Certain?

223
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,695
Not through reason or intelligence.

224
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,149
- Something else.
- You're right.

225
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,658
Look what someone gave me.

226
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,532
Chocolates?

227
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,820
Don't worry,
I don't need anything.

228
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,404
When I'm hungry, I get what I need
from home when no one's there.

229
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,410
I've got the keys.

230
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,136
Isn't Charles here?

231
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,349
He might be angry with me
about the day before yesterday.

232
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,053
He hasn't been back since.

233
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,309
- Did you fight?
- No.

234
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,645
But I let him know I was sad.

235
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,942
He spoke to me gently
but his voice was so dry, almost polite,

236
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,231
that I froze.

237
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,735
Usually it's me comforting him.

238
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,988
Have you heard the news?

239
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,450
He's going to stay with Edwige
while her dad's away.

240
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,370
I know he wants to.

241
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,499
Don't get annoyed.
He'll be better off with her.

242
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,994
But I daren't encourage him
or he'll insist on staying.

243
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,000
I don't want him to be stuck here
out of duty.

244
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,540
That would kill off any love
he had left for me.

245
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,879
Can you believe he brought me these?

246
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,858
Do you want one?

247
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,125
Are you mad?
What's got into you? Tell me.

248
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,498
I knew you needed me.

249
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,543
Yes, I need you, Michel.

250
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,298
But not today. I'd rather be alone today.

251
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,440
It's awful seeing you here.

252
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,404
Come on, let's go out.

253
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,682
If my book's here, it's a bad sign.

254
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,977
It means it's not having the effect
I intended.

255
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,488
He thinks it's great.

256
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,530
- How do you know?
- He told me.

257
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,700
I think he's trying to please you.
He knows we're friends.

258
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,845
He keeps it hidden. I prefer that.

259
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,812
He's two-faced. Come the revolution...

260
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,144
- There won't be any revolution.
- Why?

261
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,023
- It's too late.
- If you say so.

262
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,822
- You said so yourself the other day.
- I did?

263
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,272
- It's tempting.
- What?

264
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,351
Nothing.

265
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,614
Can I borrow it?

266
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,325
I'll sell it to you. I've got another one.

267
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,447
Put it down.

268
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,995
Is it your gun that Charles has got?

269
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,460
- He was staring at the bullet in his hand.
- The bullet?

270
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,883
He probably wants a good look
before he puts a bullet in his head.

271
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,599
Charles!

272
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,819
He was here.

273
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,196
Charles!

274
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,731
Aren't you worried?

275
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,368
May I?

276
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,379
- You're shivering.
- No.

277
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,759
Yes, you are.
Come on. Let's warm you up.

278
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,908
Here, drink this.

279
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,035
I'm out of here.

280
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,700
Go on then.

281
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,287
All right? Am I late?

282
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:17,873
Alberte?

283
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,336
I prayed that you'd come back to life

284
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,080
so that I could hold you in my arms again
and kiss you like before.

285
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,554
Was I dead?

286
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,770
Then I woke up

287
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,652
to find you close to me.
It feels so good.

288
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,151
You know I'll never leave you.

289
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,115
Yes, I'm getting married.

290
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,953
- To Edwige?
- To Alberte.

291
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,410
- It's the only solution.
- Do you really think so?

292
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,788
- There is no other.
- Here it comes.

293
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,335
- I'll come with you.
- No, don't.

294
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:35,639
Hasn't the acceptable dose for humans
been rather hastily assessed?

295
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,141
I don't think so.

296
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,138
It's 0.17 rem.

297
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,183
A rem is the effect produced
on the organism by 1 rad of radiation.

298
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,192
A rad is equivalent to 100 ergs per gram.

299
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,828
Do nuclear power stations,

300
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,660
apart from permanently
destroying rivers,

301
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,959
preclude any threat of radioactivity
to the population?

302
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,205
If the precautions are insufficient,
we'll adopt more as we go along.

303
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,024
The gases given off
are mainly krypton and tritium.

304
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,657
They require processing plants
and waste has to be stored.

305
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,412
Isn't there a risk in transporting
that waste?

306
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,157
Trains carrying uranium were derailed,
one in the US and another in Germany.

307
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,783
- The containers remained intact.
- That was lucky.

308
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,464
Plutonium is more dangerous than uranium.
It lasts indefinitely.

309
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,214
Isn't the danger increased
by road transportation?

310
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,840
The engineers and technicians
are handling that problem.

311
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:06,267
Once stored, doesn't the waste
threaten to contaminate drinking water?

312
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,516
The earth's drinking water is comparable
to a drop of water on an orange.

313
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,653
Has the possibility of earthquakes
been considered?

314
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,985
And doesn't dumping the waste in the sea,

315
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,737
as we have become accustomed to doing,

316
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,821
mean the total destruction

317
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,160
of marine flora and fauna?

318
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,994
Never mind.
It's the future generations who'll pay.

319
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,036
The United States are planning

320
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,792
to build 1,000 nuclear power stations.

321
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,592
It is thought
that the USSR will build double that.

322
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:39,427
And you're not terrified by the sudden
proliferation of these power stations?

323
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,931
No, not at all.

324
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:45,387
Why the atom and not solar energy
or tidal power, for example?

325
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,717
Whose choice is it?

326
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,223
It's dictated by the work on
armaments and new types of weapons.

327
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,600
The masterpiece
is a thermonuclear missile

328
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,357
that will kill 20 million
men, women and children.

329
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:07,349
It's incredible that to reassure people,
you simply have to deny the facts.

330
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:10,708
What facts?
This is the supernatural. Nothing is clear.

331
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,212
You're unbelievable!

332
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,799
STOP REQUESTED

333
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,071
Governments are short-sighted.

334
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,583
Don't accuse governments.

335
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,920
No government in the world today
can boast that it's actually governing.

336
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,040
It's the masses who determine events.

337
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:00,135
Obscure forces whose laws are unfathomable.

338
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,132
It's true that something
is driving us against our will.

339
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,257
You have to go along with it.

340
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,764
And we do go along with it.

341
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,812
Who is it that's making
a mockery of humanity?

342
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,564
Who's leading us by the nose?

343
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,102
The devil, probably.

344
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,074
NO BATHING

345
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,337
Do you find her selfish?

346
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,624
She lets me go, then she's sad.

347
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,751
It's worse than if she hadn't let me go.

348
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,060
- Do you love him very much?
- Yes.

349
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,349
In that case...

350
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,105
What?

351
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,817
- Do you want him to be happy?
- Yes, of course.

352
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,185
If it seems he'd be happier with you...

353
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,563
Perhaps I'm not the person to say this...

354
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,901
It's all decided as you well know.

355
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,538
What's decided?

356
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,667
Leave us alone and don't get cross.

357
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,170
You stay.

358
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,177
- Did he tell you we were getting married?
- Yes.

359
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,971
He told me too, but it's just for show.

360
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,505
- It calms him down.
- That's what I thought.

361
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,751
He's caught a live fish.

362
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,847
Quick, let's hide.

363
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:19,640
<i>We've arrested one person.
Keep us posted.</i>

364
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,201
I've been told everything

365
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,367
and I thought I should come and see you

366
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,291
in view of my interest in you.

367
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,998
I hope you'll let me come back.

368
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,754
You must not doubt my sincerity.

369
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,795
What will you do?

370
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,922
Make it up with your parents?

371
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,809
Go home?

372
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,511
Return to what made you leave
in the first place?

373
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,898
Or hang on to your freedom?

374
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,488
I can get you a good position
with a colleague

375
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,607
or with me at the bookshop.

376
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,859
You'll never find a better friend than me.

377
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,786
Let me prove it to you.

378
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,287
Get away.

379
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,208
Take your money and get lost!

380
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,251
You're making a mistake.
I'm offering you protection.

381
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,857
- What happened?
- Nothing at all.

382
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,864
Why have you come?

383
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,253
All I've got left

384
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,005
is an old sweater

385
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,753
and the Coke bottles to take back.

386
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,598
- There's no more love.
- You didn't love him.

387
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,344
Or you only loved him
so you could be generous and forgiving.

388
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,306
He wasn't unfaithful.

389
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,480
He didn't know
he didn't love me any more.

390
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,195
You were only jealous
when he was away.

391
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,064
Leave me alone. Go away.

392
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,031
You're going to make me leave,
go back home.

393
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,367
I don't want to, do you hear?

394
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,878
Go away, please.

395
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,234
Are you there?

396
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,846
It's Valentin, he's back on drugs. Quick.

397
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,050
Are you hungry?

398
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,679
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

399
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:35,243
He says he has plenty of places he can go,
but he's lying.

400
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,583
He's safe here in the meantime.

401
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,631
Lock him in if necessary.
I'll be back.

402
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,559
- Don't go right away.
- I'm in a hurry.

403
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,539
No, leave that.

404
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,168
You should go to bed now.

405
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,964
Go to bed? Yes, I'm going to bed.
Straight to bed.

406
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:29,981
Here.

407
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,095
People here say you're mad too.

408
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,548
Victor Hugo says here,
on the subject of cathedrals,

409
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,671
"Such places are really holy."

410
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,599
But somewhere else he says,

411
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:03,050
"A cathedral is divine.
God is present.

412
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,354
"But if a priest appears,
God is no longer present."

413
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:10,313
- That's going too far, don't you think?
- Me and God, you know...

414
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:14,072
You're still going, we're going together.

415
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,736
On one condition.

416
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,658
All right.

417
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,742
I'm noting that you deny
any part in breaking open the boxes

418
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,118
or any part in the theft.

419
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,201
Go ahead.

420
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,746
- And yet you weren't alone.
- True.

421
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,261
A second sleeping bag is proof of that.

422
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,598
- Who was he?
- I don't know his name.

423
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,176
He escaped through the open doors.
He fled. He's far away.

424
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,980
What about the leaflets?

425
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,483
I found them on the chairs when I arrived.

426
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,579
I suppose you deny any intention to
distribute them

427
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:48,001
like in St. Bernard's the other night?

428
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:49,740
You're very clever,

429
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,800
but if I'd wanted to hand
these leaflets out in the church,

430
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,909
I wouldn't have been screwing them up
to make them unreadable,

431
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:01,037
and put them in the state they were in
when you found them in my pockets.

432
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:05,875
Can you explain what you were doing
in St. Rйmy church with that record player?

433
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,510
Do you refuse to answer?

434
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,757
No, but you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

435
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,314
Answer!

436
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,981
You must understand
that I don't want your attention.

437
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,692
I need to be left alone.

438
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,614
That stupid business has shaken him up.

439
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,620
He hasn't even thought of getting up
since yesterday.

440
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:46,252
Only a great analyst
like Dr. Mime can make him better.

441
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:49,418
- How do we get him to accept that?
- I have some addresses.

442
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,353
Yes, I've forgiven him.

443
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,480
But will you ever forgive me, Michel?

444
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,615
I've been awful to you.

445
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,035
I want to know
what's going on in that heart.

446
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,409
Kiss me.

447
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,801
He has fled from his bed.

448
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,679
- When?
- I don't know.

449
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,516
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

450
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,810
Quickly, let's go.

451
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,518
How did this clash with society arise?

452
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,270
It's my normal state.

453
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,769
I've kept it quiet for a long time.

454
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:30,437
Don't you get pleasure from non-action?

455
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,360
Yes, but the pleasure of despair,
obviously.

456
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,401
- Do you feel guilty?
- Guilty?

457
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,650
Towards yourself?

458
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,837
Guilty without being so.

459
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:45,832
I know I'm more
intelligent than the others.

460
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,544
I'm perfectly aware of my superiority.

461
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,460
But if I did anything,

462
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:54,289
then I'd be useful, even if slightly,
in a world that disgusts me.

463
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:58,091
I'd betray my ideas.
It would only entrench me further.

464
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:01,055
I prefer to know that there's no way out.

465
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:05,512
Isn't begging in the streets, as I've seen
people like you do, a bit degrading?

466
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,682
Charity degrades the donor
as much as the recipient.

467
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,394
Isn't that a good excuse for laziness?

468
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,073
Perhaps, but so what?

469
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,899
If my aim was money and profit,
everyone would respect me.

470
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,649
Isn't being right
compensation for being alive?

471
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,857
In losing my life,
here's what I'd lose.

472
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:13,413
Family planning, package holidays -
cultural, sporting, linguistic.

473
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,290
The cultivated man's library.

474
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,831
All sports. How to adopt a child.

475
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,758
Parent-teacher associations.

476
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:24,714
Education. Teaching 0 to 4 years,
7 to 14 years, 14 to 17 years.

477
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,510
Preparation for marriage.

478
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:29,644
Military duties. Europe.

479
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,930
Decorations - honorary insignia.

480
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,564
The single woman.
Paid sick leave, unpaid sick leave.

481
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,730
The successful man.
Tax benefits for the elderly.

482
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,689
Local taxes.

483
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:44,156
Hire purchase.
Radio and television rentals.

484
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:47,073
Credit cards. Home repairs.

485
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:50,407
Index-linking. VAT and consumers.

486
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,916
Do you believe in God?

487
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,553
I believe, so far as possible,
in everlasting life.

488
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:06,012
But if I commit suicide,
I can't think I'd be condemned

489
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,058
for not comprehending
the incomprehensible.

490
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,726
How long have you been thinking
about death for?

491
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,408
He's there. All is well.

492
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:32,952
- All is well?
- Yes.

493
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,298
Often in my sleep
I see myself murdered, dead.

494
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,470
But I go on being hit.

495
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:50,433
I'm being trampled. It's awful.

496
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,304
All that for a holy cause.

497
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:55,438
Once the dream is over,
do you feel like a martyr?

498
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,273
Only an amateur.

499
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:00,353
When I wanted to drown myself in the bath,
or pull the trigger,

500
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,562
I was well aware of how hard it was.

501
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,941
Is your father in your dreams?

502
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,653
It's not very clear.

503
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,114
What does he do?

504
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:14,031
He's a property developer in the provinces,
or a contractor. I'm not really sure.

505
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,120
He's rich.
He pulls down trees with machines.

506
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:21,002
A new upsurge of libido
in our western world

507
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:25,711
might bring a destructive counterforce
for people in your father's profession.

508
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,173
What about your mother?

509
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:31,058
The richer he gets, the more she loves him.

510
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,512
Do you make love often?

511
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,848
Often. It puts me in touch
with my emotions, my feelings.

512
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:42,561
In your sexual relations, are you aware
of your fiancйe's bodily needs?

513
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,905
We don't have relations any more.

514
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,617
She was good in bed.
I thought that was love.

515
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,985
I've lost a wonderful girl.

516
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,368
When did you stop studying?

517
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:59,078
After higher maths.
I organised a sixth form cell at school.

518
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,580
And now you belong to left-wing groups?

519
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,132
Yes. Or rather, no.

520
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,887
No more politics in your life?

521
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,006
The rejection of all politics.

522
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,653
- Do you have any problem eating?
- Sometimes.

523
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,982
- I mean do you have an aversion to food?
- Not at all.

524
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,869
Loss of appetite
often accompanies severe depression.

525
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,204
I'm not depressed.

526
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,451
I just want the right to be myself.

527
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,625
I don't want to be forced to
give up wanting,

528
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:47,591
to replace my true desires with false ones
based on statistics, surveys, formulae,

529
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:51,051
ultra-stupid American-Russian
scientific classifications.

530
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,469
I don't want to be a slave or a specialist.

531
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:57,226
Were you beaten as a child?
Try to remember.

532
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,729
I was spanked.

533
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:04,891
Do you know that the feeling
of being crushed by the society you live in

534
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:09,690
might well be the result
of that spanking you got as a child?

535
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:13,441
That, together with the painful dream
of being murdered for a good cause,

536
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:17,362
would point to the development
of psychomotor symptoms

537
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,164
and explain the root
of your disgust and your wish to die.

538
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,205
But I don't want to die.

539
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,000
What? Of course you do.

540
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:33,305
I hate life but I hate death too.
I find it appalling.

541
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,514
Look, leave it to me.

542
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:43,562
Come back in two days.
Thursday, same time.

543
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:47,982
But Doctor, I'm not ill.
My illness is seeing too clearly.

544
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,155
Of course.
It's 200 francs a session.

545
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,634
Doctor.

546
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,479
- I don't think I will ever be able to...
- Pay?

547
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:33,653
Do the deed. To think I would suddenly stop
thinking, seeing, hearing.

548
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:38,825
That's why the ancient Romans entrusted
a servant or friend with the task.

549
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,335
- He's saved.
- Do you think so?

550
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:35,465
Edwige?

551
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:49,541
I know he has one to sell.

552
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,044
What if he refuses?

553
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,997
He won't. Give him this.

554
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,462
What do you need it for?

555
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,092
You'll see.
Just don't tell him it's for me.

556
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,592
But look...

557
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,353
Go on. I'll wait for you here.

558
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:29,591
And the bullets?

559
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:31,352
It's loaded.

560
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,221
Farewell.

561
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,841
Will you do me a favour?

562
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,257
No.

563
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,302
Worthy of the ancient Romans.

564
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,560
What ancient Romans?

565
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,018
Look.

566
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,439
That's all for you if you do as I ask.

567
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,275
What?

568
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,948
I'll tell you later.
Come with me for now.

569
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,891
I'll wait downstairs. Hurry.

570
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:05,609
Are you all right?

571
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,029
Let's get some air. Come on.

572
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,435
We're stopping here. Follow me.

573
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,499
A tot of something strong,
anything, brandy.

574
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,336
What about you?

575
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:50,328
Nothing.

576
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:34,413
Let's go.

577
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,024
Can't you wait?

578
01:34:37,296 --> 01:34:38,723
Where are we going?

579
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:42,339
Wherever you like. Here or there.

580
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:18,058
I thought at a time like this
I'd have sublime thoughts.

581
01:35:26,129 --> 01:35:27,349
Shall I tell you...?
