4
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,310
我还在问自已是否做的对
I still ask myself if I did the right thing

5
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,730
当我离开了他漂泊的城市
when I abandoned his floating city

6
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,560
我指的不仅是工作
And I don't mean only for the work

7
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,780
事实是  那样才是真正的朋友
fact is, a friend like that a real friend

8
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,990
你再也不会见到他这样的人
you won't meet one again

9
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,740
如果你不想出海
If you just decide to hang up your sea legs

10
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,120
如果你只想站在陆地上
if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet

11
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,420
如果你不再想听见天籁之音
and if then you no loner hear the music of the gods around you

12
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,880
但是  像他常说过的一样
But, like he used to say

13
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,970
只要你有个好故事  你就永远不会被人忘记
You're never really done for as long as you got a good story

14
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,430
一个值得告诉别人的故事
and someone to tell it to

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,440
可问题是
Trouble is

16
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,570
没人相信我的故事
nobody'd believe a single word of my story

17
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,380
每次都是这样
It happened every time

18
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,010
某人一抬头就看到她
Someone would look up and see her

19
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,640
很难理解
It's difficult to understand

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,730
那船上有上千人
There'd be more than a thousand of us on that ship

21
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,570
有富人  移民  陌生人和我们
Traveling rich folks, immigrants and strange people, and us

22
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,110
但是总会有一个人
Yet there was always one

23
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,030
一眼就看到她的单身汉
One guy alone who would see her first

24
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,540
或许他只是坐在那吃东西或是在甲板上散步
Maybe he was just sitting there eating or walking on the deck

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,080
或许他正在缝补裤子
Maybe he was just fixing his pants

26
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,840
他抬起头  很快地向海上望去  便看到了她
He'd look up for a second. A quick glance out to sea and he'd see her

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,300
他的脚像生了根  心也悸动不安
Then he'd just stand there rooted to the spot, his heart racing

28
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,180
每次  每一次  我发誓
And every time every damn time, I swear

29
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,440
他转向我  冲着船朝着每个人大喊
he'd turn to us, towards the ship towards everybody and scream

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,810
美国
America

31
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,160
海上钢琴家
The Legend of 1900

32
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,520
纽约
New York

33
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,410
先看到美国的人
The one who sees America first

34
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,700
每个船上都有一个
There's one on every ship

35
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,250
不要以为这是偶然
And don't be thinking it's an accident

36
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,670
或是视觉幻想  那是命运
Or some optical illusion It's destiny

37
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,590
这些人
Those are people who always

38
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,800
在他们的生命中都是有印记的
have that precise instant stamped on their life

39
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,970
当他们是孩子的时候你看他们眼睛
And when they were kids you could look into their eyes

40
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,560
如果你仔细观察你就会看到她
and if you looked carefully enough you'd already see her

41
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,350
美国
America

42
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,990
我没见过多少美国人
And I've seen a few Americas

43
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,950
呆在那船上六年
Six years on that ship five crossings a year

44
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:03,950
一年横跨五次欧洲和美国
Europe, America and back always soaking in the ocean

45
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,250
当你踏上大陆
When you stepped on land

46
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,960
你在上厕所的时候都会感觉晃
you couldn't even piss straight in the john

47
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,170
我的意思是  厕所是不动的
It was teady. The john, I mean

48
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,710
你却像个白痴一样不停的晃
But you'd keep bobbing like an idiot

49
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,430
你可以安然无恙的离开船  但是却不可能离开大海
You can get off a ship all right But off the ocean

50
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,970
马上要关门了
I was just closing

51
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,600
需要点什么
What can I do for you?

52
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,850
当我登上这船的时候才24岁
When I boarded, I was 24 years old

53
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,520
一生中我只在乎一件事
And I only cared about one thing in life

54
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,150
演奏小号
Playing the trumpet

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,570
我要卖这个
I'm selling it

56
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,870
康恩
Conn

57
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,000
不错
Not bad

58
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,090
黄铜是最好的
Best brass money can buy

59
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,350
最高出六磅七先令
Six pounds, ten shillings Best I can do

60
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,720
先生  这是我的全部
That horn's my whole life, mister

61
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,430
即使我不是什么名人
Even being a nobody

62
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,020
至少也值20美元
has got to be worth more than twenty lousy bucks

63
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,230
事情就是这样  我认为连二先令都不值
It that's how things are, I suppose it's barely worth half a crown

64
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,070
走后请关门
Shut the door when you leave please

65
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,410
好吧  老爹
Okay, pops

66
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,030
你赢了
you win

67
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,250
你刚买了一部分音乐史
You just bought yourself a piece of musical history

68
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,250
如果你想要我的建议
Now if you want my advice

69
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,800
去吃顿好的
go out, treat yourself to a decent meal

70
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,110
至少让我在吹一次
At least let me play it one last time

71
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,360
我没有时间
Young man I don't have time to waste

72
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,950
好吧
All right

73
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,910
那就快点
Hurry up, then

74
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,460
要关门了
I'm closing

75
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,080
谢谢
Thank you

76
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,870
这样才完美  你说呢
Two peas in a pod, wouldn't you say

77
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,580
这是你刚才吹的那段音乐
It's the music you were just playing

78
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,040
叫什么
What is it?

79
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,210
没有名字
It doesn't have a name

80
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,260
只有少数人听过
Just a handful of people have had the privilege of hearing it

81
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,640
这种曲风  今天早上我就在想
That style. I was wondering since this morning, but...

82
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,400
我不认识这个出神入化的钢琴师
I can't work out who this amazing piano player is

83
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,570
我想你从来没听说过他
I don't think you ever heard of him

84
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,570
他是谁
Who is he?

85
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,620
如果我告诉你这个钢琴师从来不存在
If I told you this pianist never existed

86
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,160
我没说谎
I wouldn't be lying

87
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,780
我不喜欢秘密
I don't like secrets

88
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,910
快点  美国佬  这人是谁
Come on now, Yank who the devil is playing?

89
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,080
那是我的秘密
That's my secret

90
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,220
那是这个该死的世纪的第一年
It was the first year of this frigging century

91
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,940
被一个弗吉尼亚不知名的黑人煤矿工命名的
as defined by an unknown colored coal stoker on the Virginian

92
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,900
该死的有钱人  什么都没留下
Fucking rich-ass bastards Can't lose nothing

93
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,570
除了烟头和脏兮兮的手帕
but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs

94
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,200
就不能丢块手表
Can't lose no watch

95
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,530
或是旧的大理石或手链
not even a beat-up Elgin or a sorry-ass cufflink

96
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,040
我在说什么  连假戒指都没有
What am I talking about? Not even a fake fucking ring

97
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,580
看看这
Look here

98
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,670
一根烟
A whole cigar

99
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,340
一定是某个可怜人的
Must've been somebody poor at the party

100
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,710
看看这垃圾
Look at this shit

101
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,760
肮脏的白痴
Nasty fucker

102
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,100
该死的有钱人  除非他们欠你钱否则不会给你留下什么
Damn rich. Don't forget nothing unless they owe you some money

103
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,650
你这小家伙在这干嘛
What in the scuts you doing here?

104
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,900
"T.D. 雷蒙斯"
"T.D. Lemons"

105
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,370
你好 雷蒙
Howdy do there, Lemon

106
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,040
移民的混蛋
Immigrant bastard

107
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,290
你说对了  这就是移人应该做的
You said it That's the way the immigrants do it

108
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,540
有一个婴儿在船上
Have a baby on the ship

109
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,880
留下了一个活口需要喂养
and then leave on board another mouth to feed

110
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,760
这样可以避免移民局找麻烦
And, like that, avoid trouble with the immigration office

111
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,550
这样的孩子长大了会干什么
What's a boy like him going to be when he grows up?

112
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,430
成为另一个移民
Another immigrant

113
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,100
不用理这些混蛋  雷蒙
Don't pay those bastards no mind Lemon

114
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,180
来吧  喝吧
Go on, lap it up, boy

115
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
这个孩子被遗弃在头等舱的钢琴上
This one they left in first class on top the piano

116
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,730
他们希望有钱人能来
They are hoping some rich guy will come

117
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,230
给他喂个金勺子
and stick a silver spoon in his mouth

118
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,400
然而谁捡到了这个孩子呢
And who does the little ape get instead?

119
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,820
一个穷煤矿工
A poor coal stoker

120
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,070
有人把你当奶妈了  丹尼
Someoe is taking you for a sucker, Danny

121
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,540
他们快乐了  你却痛苦了
They have the fun You have the misery

122
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,910
该死的穷人
Fuck poverty

123
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,460
你们这些讨厌的褐家鼠
You stinking sewer rats

124
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,130
T.D 写在那个盒子上  你们这帮白痴知道那是什么意思嘛
T.D. was wrote on that box. Any of you shitheads know what that means?

125
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,510
我忘了  你们都不识字
I forgot. You all can't read

126
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,970
意思就是  谢谢丹尼  谢谢丹尼
It means, "Thanks, Danny." "Thanks, Danny"

127
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,800
他们是给我留着的  我要把他养大
They left him for me and I'm gonna keep him

128
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,680
你们去死吧
Rest of you all can go fuck yourselves

129
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,390
丹尼  你打算给他叫他什么
Danny, what are you going to call the nino?

130
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,140
该死  我没想到这个
Hell, I ain't think about that

131
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,810
我打算以我的名字命名
To start off I'm going to name him after me

132
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,820
丹尼 博德曼
Danny Boodman

133
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,360
T.D. 是中间名
Then I'll put "T.D." in the middle

134
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,490
就像富人放在中间一样  你们说呢
Iike rich folks puts that in the middle, don't you think?

135
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,950
把名字放在中间他就是个富人了  你们觉的怎么样
That give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?

136
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,830
所有的律师都有中间名字
All fucking lawyers gots initials in the middle of their names

137
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,160
我的律师叫乔纳森 PTK 旺德
Well, my lawyer was Jonathan PTK Wonder

138
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,670
如果我的孩子长大了是个律师我发誓我会亲手杀了他
My son grow up to be a lawyer I swear I'll kill him myself

139
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,840
但是孩子的名字还是会叫丹尼 博德曼 T.D・雷蒙
But the boy's name is still going to be Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon

140
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,670
他不是没爹的孩子丹尼
He ain't the son of no fucking duke, Danny

141
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,680
你在星期二发现他的就应该叫他星期二
You found him on a Tuesday Call him "Tuesday"

142
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,010
你不像看起来那么笨
You ain't as dumb as you look colored boy

143
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,970
我在这个该死的新世纪
I found him the first month

144
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,440
的第一年第一个月里发现了他
of the first year of this frigging new century

145
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,480
所以我叫他1900
So I calls him: Nineteen Hundred

146
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,070
1900?  但那是个数字
Nineteen Hundred? But that's a number

147
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,190
曾经是数字  但现在是个名字
It was a number, now it's a name

148
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,070
丹尼 博德曼 T.D・雷蒙　1900
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred

149
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,540
丹尼  你的婴儿不高兴了
Danny, your little bambino is not so happy

150
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,580
快点  快点  别怕  你妈妈来了
Come on, hurry. Hurry up Don't worry, your mama's here

151
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,380
该死  这么个小东西怎么拉这么多
Damn. How can something that small shit so much?

152
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,800
这就是1900怎么样长大的
And that's how little Nineteen Hundred grew up

153
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,220
在一个像船一样大的摇篮里
Inside that cradle as big as a shi

154
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,390
但自从丹尼怕他们由于一些商业
But since Danny was afraid they'd take him away

155
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,690
文件和签证就把他带走
on account of some business concerning documents and visas

156
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,020
因此他童年时
the boy lived his early years

157
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,740
总是躲在弗吉尼亚号船舱里
always hiding in the belly of the Virginian

158
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,510
好  现在你自已试试
Okay, now try one for yourself

159
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,630
用你的手指头按着这些文字
Put your finger up here against these words

160
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,010
这样字母就不会跑掉
so the letters can't run off on you

161
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,600
人
"Man"

丹尼, 你为什么觉的这么好笑
Danny, why are you laughing so much

175
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,140
因为这些是马的名字  你不觉的好笑嘛
Because these are names of horses Don't that make you laugh?

176
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,810

183
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,910
妈妈
A mama?

184
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,830

192
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,570
T.D. 不是谢谢丹尼的意思
T.D. doesn't mean "Thanks, Danny"

193
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,400
这个变态是谁
Who's this pansy ass?

194

今晚就读这些吧

陆地上有鲨鱼会活吃你

离他们远点  听见了嘛
You keep away from they, you hear?

201
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,670
丹尼  什么是孤儿院
Danny, what's an orphanage?

202
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,930
孤儿院就像一个大的监狱
Well, a orphanage is like a great big prison

203
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,100
没孩子的人都会被关在里面

It took him three days to go toes up, old Danny

218
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,150
他下葬那天"饮用水"第六次在芝加哥获胜

226
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,720
阿门

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,270
音乐
Music

228
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,080
1900那时候才八岁
Nineteen Hundred was eight years old then

229
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,960
他在欧洲和美国之间旅行
He'd made the trip between Europe and America

230
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,210
我猜大概有五十次
about fifty times, I imagine

231
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,380
大海就是他的家
The ocean was his home

232
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,510
他从来没有到过陆地
He never set foot on dry land Never

233
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,470
尽量他在港口看过很多次
Though he'd seen it from the ports a hundred times

234
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,850
但他从来没有下过船
But he never got off the boat

235
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,350
问题是
Problem was

236
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,930
世上没人知道他的存在
as far as the world was concerned he didn't even exist

237
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:56,520
没有一个城市  一个教会  一个医院  监狱或棒球队
There wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team

238
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,020
知道他的名字
that had his name any place

239
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,780
他没有国籍  他没有生日  没有家人
He didn't have a country, he didn't even have a birth date. No family

240
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,030
他八岁了
He was eight years old but officially

241
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,450
但是官方却没有他出生的纪录
he had never even been born

242
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,220
禁止通行
"No Entry"

243
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,960
船长  船长  醒醒
Captain. Captain, wake up

244
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,460
他叫什么名字
What's his name?

245
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,540
1900
Nineteen Hundred

246
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,420
不是歌名  那孩子的名
Not the song, the boy

247
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,470
1900
Nineteen Hundred

248
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,180
像这曲子一样
Like the song

249
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,370
1900  这一切都违背常规
Nineteen Hundred, all of this is entirely against the regulations

250
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,710
该死的常规
Fuck the regulations

251
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,430
但是我不明白
But I don't understand

252
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,430
这和这个唱片有什么关系
what the record has to do with any of this

253
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,640
这个唱片不应该存在
This record shouldn't exist

254
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,570
唯一存在的混音唱片在被剪断后就被销毁了
The only existing matrix was destroyed right after it was cut

255
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,330
这就是原版
This is a matrix

256
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,960
听起来像是
Quite handy for on-the-spot recordings

257
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,500
现场录制的版本
that sort of business

258
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,840
你怎么能用手去碰它
How did you get your hands on this?

259
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,550
我花了不少时间
I spend the better part of the day

260
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,600
把碎片拼在一起
putting the bits and pieces together

261
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,740
我发现它纯属偶然
I found them by accident.

262
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,890
就藏在那架钢琴中
Hidden inside one of those two pianos

263
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,310
我从一个二手商那买到的
I bought them from a second-hand dealer

264
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,870
他们正在普利茅斯
They've emptied out an old hospital ship

265
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,440
拆一艘医疗船
at Plymouth

266
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,330
老兄  在那边
It's over there, mate

267
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,090
慢点  别那么快
Slow down not so fast with that pulley

268
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,130
小心一点
Easy up there, easy

269
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,430
小心点  这可不是香蕉
Watch that! These aren't bananas, you know

270
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,490
-你从哪来  -利物浦
-Where are you from?  -Liverpool

271
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,240
-工作呢  -理发师

-录取  -非常感谢
-Sign him on -Thanks very much

273
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,170
下一个 你是干什么的
Next. What's your trade?

274
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,170
我是木匠  非常好的技师
I'm a carpenter. A good mechanic

275
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,670
滚出去
Get out

276
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,710
你的工作是
What do you do?

277
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,300
演奏小号
I play the trumpet

278
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,680
船上已经有乐师了  下一个
We've already got musicians on board. Next

279
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,040
他要去干嘛
Where the hell is he going?

280
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,450
-什么曲子 -我不知道
What's that? I don't know

281
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,830
你怎么能不知道 是爵士乐
When you don't know what it is it's jazz

282
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,950
这是我生命中最快乐的日子
It was the happiest day of my life

283
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,040
人们的眼中充满了希望
All those people hope in their eyes

284
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,500
道别声 汽笛声
The goodbyes, the sirens

285
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,840
这个漂浮的世界开始了它的旅程
And that big floating world starting to move

286
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,400
我觉得这是为我举办的
It felt like one big party A huge bash

287
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,970
盛大的派对
just for me

288
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,530
但是三天后
But just three days later

289
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,100
大海厌倦了欢乐
the ocean got tired of the festivities

290
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,670
康恩
Hey, Conn?

291
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,260
你没事吧
What's the matter?

292
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,800
晕船了？
Lose your sea legs?

293
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,220
你是不是新来的小号手
YOu're the new trumpet man aren't you?

294
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,930
用康恩牌小号的
And you blow a Conn

295
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,270
让我来减轻你的痛苦
Come with me I have a cure for your misery

296
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,770
跟我来
Follow me

297
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,470
请把保护松掉
Take the brakes off, please

298
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,890
你疯了
That's crazy

299
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,440
相信我  把保护松掉
Trust me. Just take the brakes off

300
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,490
坐到我边上来
Hop on next to me

301
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,410
你是什么人 疯子吗
What are you, some kind of nut case

302
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,750
你最好快点 要不上不来了
You better get on now or you never will

303
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,360
告诉我 你有小孩吗
Tell me something do you have children?

304
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,360
这种天气
They'll lock you up

305
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,870
小孩会被锁在孤儿院的
in the orphanage one of these days

306
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,370
他疯了
He's nuts

307
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,500
妈呀
Oh, mama

308
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,380
看得出来你喜欢赛马
I see you know your horses

309
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,420
还好啦
Just a litte

310
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,670
不错
Good man

311
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,590
晚上好 船长
Good evening, Captain

312
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,050
您要不要试一下
Care for a ride?

313
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,970
再说一遍那窗子他妈的有多大
Tell me again how big the fucking window was

314
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,810
那窗子可真他妈大
It was a big fucking window

315
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,970
我们会在这
We're going to be shoveling coal

316
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,140
永远的铲下去
on this ship till eternity

317
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,600
操
No shit

318
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,590
至少要等你知道
Least you know

319
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,610
长大了该干什么
what you'll be doing when you grow up

320
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,910
康恩
Conn

321
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,580
你是不是新奥尔良人
You're from New Orleans, right?

322
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,370
你怎么知道
How'd you know that?

323
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,500
我喜欢那个地方
I love that town

324
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,800
真的吗  我有一段时间没回去了
Really? I haven't been there in a while?

325
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,050
冬天的时候  漂亮极了
In winter, it's beautiful

326
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,550
三月份
And in March

327
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,640
你总能碰到那样的午后
you can always count on one afternoon

328
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,310
至少可以想像一下
when you least expect it

329
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,560
浓雾滑入
the fog slides in

330
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,690
就像白色的栅栏
a milky barrier

331
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,610
漂浮在街灯下
hangs just below the street lamps

332
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,030
淹没了万物
It cuts everything off

333
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,780
就像白色的刀  太神奇了
Iike a white blade. And it's magic

334
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,540
看不见房顶
Houses lose their top floors

335
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,370
看不见树枝
trees lose their branches

336
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,380
看不见圣路易斯教堂的尖塔
St. Louis Cathedral loses its spires

337
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,380
人们擦肩而过却互不相见
People passing by they lose their heads

338
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,920
脖子以上都消失了
So from the neck up everything disappears

339
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,010
你能在杰克森广场上碰到
All you can see in Jackson Square

340
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,390
人们像无头苍蝇一样到处乱闯
is decapitated bodies stumbling around

341
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,890
撞到谁就问
bumping into each other saying

342
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,390
“你家人呢”
"How's your mama and them?"

343
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,350
就是那样 太糟了 不过不会很久
That's it Too bad it doesn't last long

344
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,400
你怎么知道这些
How do you know all these things?

345
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,950
在我上船之前
You know ever since I came on board

346
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,700
我听说有这么一个人
I been hearing a lot of talk about a guy

347
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,620
他好像在船上出生
He's supposed to have been born on this ship

348
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,160
而且从来没下过船
and never been off it since

349
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,710
不可思议
Crazy story

350
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,920
20年从来没
Twenty years without ever

351
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,130
踏上陆地
setting foot on land?

352
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,290
27年
Twenty seven

353
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,650
听说这家伙做的音乐
They say this guy makes music

354
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,010
前无古人
that's never been heard before

355
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,840
我也听说过
I've heard of him too

356
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,140
刚开始我以为你就是
First off I thought you were the guy

357
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,890
但是经过这些事后
But then something didn't add up

358
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,430
我想  如果这位就是1900
I figured: if he's Nineteen Hundred

359
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,560
他怎么会熟知新奥尔良
how could he know New Orleans so well?

360
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,730
因为你去过那
Because you've been to New Orleans

361
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,830
如果我告诉你我从没去过
If I told you I'd never set foot in that town

362
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,940
你信吗
would you believe me?

363
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,950
管你是谁
Whoever you are

364
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,200
马克斯 托尼
Max Tooney

365
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
很高兴认识你
Gald to meet you

366
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,300
知道要干什么吗
How we doing?

367
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,890
我们要拆了这东西
We're supposed to blow it up

368
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,350
不要让鱼先把它给吃了
not wait for it to be eaten by the fishes

369
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,850
你们不能拆了它
You're not going to blow up a goddamn thing

370
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,190
我最好的朋友还在船上
because my best friend is on this ship

371
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,190
你们要承担谋杀的罪行
You'll all be responsible for murder

372
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,150
让他滚出去
Get him out of here!

373
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,110
把他给我赶出去
Do whatever you want, but get him off my case

374
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,820
我不是来捣乱的 我也没疯
I'm not making this up and I'm not crazy

375
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,980
如果我告诉你
If I tell you there's a man

376
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,150
有人在维吉尼亚号上
aboard the Virginian

377
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,860
我对天发誓
Jesus Christ

378
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,570
确实还有人在船上
it means there's a man aboard the Virginian

379
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,410
我们把船上上下下清了个遍
We cleaned that scuttle from stem to stern

380
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,390
连门把手都没留下
Not even doorknobs were left

381
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,370
只留下了炸药  炸药
Only dynamite. Dynamite

382
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,170
你怎么确信有人在船上
How can you be so sure that's a man on board?

383
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,130
如果你有证据 拿出来
If you've any proof, out with it

384
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,290
因为我就是那个
Because I'm the horse's arse

385
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,460
按下爆破按钮的人
who has to throw that switch

386
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,460
我确信他在那
I'm sure he's there

387
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,130
我人生最好的时光
I spent the best years of my life

388
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,760
都在维吉尼亚号上
on the Virginian

389
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,540
换曲了
End of line

390
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,570
酷 弹下去
All right! Run it down

391
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,530
你弹琴的时候
What the hell do you think

392
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,950
都在想些什么
about when you're playing?

393
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,780
击键时
Where does your mind go

394
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,620
你的思维去了哪
when you hit the keys?

395
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,130
昨晚我在一个美丽的村庄
Last night I was in a beautiful country

396
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,020
女人香气扑鼻
Women had perfume in their hair

397
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,460
荣光焕发
Everything glowed

398
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,680
还有数不尽的老虎
And it was full of tigers

399
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,860
他在神游
He traveled.

400
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,050
每次都去往不同的地方
And each time he ended up someplace different

401
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,130
在伦敦的中心
In the heart of London

402
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,220
在穿过田园的列车上
on a train in the middle of the country

403
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,930
在火山的边缘
on the edge of a giant volcano

404
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,650
在世界上最大的教堂
in the biggest church in the world

405
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,840
数着石柱
counting the columns

406
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,030
仰望着神灵
and staring up at the crucifixes

407
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,650
他在神游
He traveled

408
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,740
孩子 弹一首欢快的塔朗泰拉
Hey, Kid, give us a good tarantella

409
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,120
那你要告诉我什么是塔朗泰拉
And you show me how a tarantella goes paisa

410
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,560
美国
America

411
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,870
你为什么不下去
Why the hell don't you get off?

412
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,620
就一次  一次而已
Just once? One time?

413
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,380
用自己的眼睛
See the world for yourself

414
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,630
去看看世界
with your own eyes?

415
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,880
你从没想过吗
You ever think about it?

416
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,510
你能做任何事
You could do anything you wanted to

417
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,470
人们会为你而疯狂
People would go crazy for you

418
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,770
兄弟 你会赚很多钱
You could make beaucoup bucks, man

419
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,640
住最好的房子
Get yourself the finest house

420
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,520
找个妻子
Get yourself a wife

421
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,980
有什么不好
Why not?

422
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,190
上帝知道
God knows you

423
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,610
你不能把余生
can't spend the rest of your life

424
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,990
变得像悠游球那样来来回回
traveling back and forth like some yo-yo

425
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,820
世界就在那儿
The world is out there

426
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,950
就是一个跳板的距离
Nothing but a gangplank to cross

427
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,580
什么是跳板  就是几步而已
And what's a gangplank? A few stupid steps

428
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,890
天呀
Christ

429
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,210
美好的生活就几步而已
everything is waiting at the bottom of those steps

430
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,790
为什么不试一下
Why don't you just do it

431
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,170
一次
one time?

432
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,590
为什么就是不下去
Why don't you just get off?

433
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:17,480
为什么  为什么
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

434
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,360
陆地上的人
I think land people

435
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,820
浪费太多时间在为什么上
waste a lot of time wondering why

436
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,400
冬天害怕夏天的迟来
Winter comes and you can't wait for summer

437
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,410
夏天担心冬天将至
Summer comes and you live in dread of winter

438
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,120
这就是为什么你不会厌倦
That's way you never tire of traveling

439
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,040
永远在追寻着
Always chasing someplace far away

440
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,710
哪里永远是夏天
where it's always summer

441
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,500
我并不羡慕
Doesn't sound like a good bet to me

442
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,140
停一下 都停下
Hold it! Stop everything

443
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,320
请原谅我
Forgive me for allowing myself

444
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,970
沉醉于你的音乐之中
to your music was so strong

445
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,650
去美国
You don't look too happy

446
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,110
你不觉得高兴吗
to be going to America

447
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,700
不是美国的原因
It's not America

448
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,450
是以前的事
It's everything I leave behind

449
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,420
几年前我还只知道我的土地
Until a few years ago I know only my field

450
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,880
对我而言那狭小的土地
The world for me started and ended there

451
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,210
就是整个世界
in that little piece of the land

452
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,470
我从来没有上过街
I never walked down the main street of a city

453
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,640
也许你不能理解
Maybe you can't understand but

454
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,350
我完全能理解
I understand perfectly

455
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,790
我知道有人
I know someone

456
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,520
也有这样的经历
who went through something very similar

457
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,940
他的土地也干涸了
And one fine day did his field go dry too?

458
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,320
他的妻子也跟神父跑了
And did his wife also run off with a priest?

459
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:36,580
他的五个孩子也被病魔夺去生命
And did the fever take his five children?

460
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,330
没有 但是他一直都很孤独
No. But he ended up alone too

461
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,370
那他比我幸运
Then he is more lucky than me

462
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:48,040
我还有一个女儿  最小的
I still have a daughter The young one

463
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,750
她活了下来
She survived

464
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,710
为了她
And it's for her

465
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,680
有一天我决定不再坐以待毙
that I decide one day to fight against my bad luck

466
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,050
我四处游走  漫无目的
and travel all over without a destination

467
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,020
有一天
And then one day

468
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,330
我去了一个
when I go through

469
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,600
从来没去过的镇
one of the many towns I never see before

470
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,400
我爬上一个小山
I come to a hill

471
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,480
然后我见到了
And then I see

472
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,030
这辈子最美的东西
the most beautiful thing in my life

473
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,820
大海
The sea

474
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,820
大海
The sea?

475
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,740
我从没看见过
I never see it before

476
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,620
听到一种声音
It was like lightning hit me

477
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,420
就像被闪电击中了
Because I hear the voice

478
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,670
大海的声音
The voice of the sea?

479
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,880
是 大海的声音
Yeah, the voice of the sea

480
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,920
我从没听过
I never heard it

481
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,720
大海的声音就像呼喊
The voice of the sea it is like a shout

482
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,050
那种大而强的呼喊
A shout big and strong

483
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,390
一刻不停
screaming and screaming

484
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,940
就好像在说
And the thing it was screaming was:

485
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,940
你
You

486
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,070
这个猪脑子
with shit instead brains

487
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:03,570
生命如此广阔  你能理解吗
life is immense can you understand that?

488
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,410
广阔无边
Immense

489
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,490
我从来没这么想过
I never think of it that way

490
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,580
脑袋就像被洗过了
A revolution was in my head

491
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,850
这就是我为什么
That's how

492
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,130
突然决定改变我的生活
I suddenly decide to change my life

493
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,800
从新来过

494
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:25,010
改变生活  从新来过
Change life. Start fresh

495
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,800
告诉你的那位朋友

也许从来没见过
Even if we never met

502
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,360
不要当心 没警察
Don't worry, no cops

503
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,670
你说了些钢琴的事
You said something about a piano

504
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,170
在哪儿
Where was it exactly?

505
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,840
在那发现的
We found it over there

506
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,090

开始了
End of the line

516
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,750
你怎么想到的
Where do yu get it?

517
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,210
什么
What?

518
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,550
灵感
The music

519
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,300
不知道  举个例子
I don't know. You see that woman over there

520
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,050
你看见那边那个女人吗
for example?

521
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,640
她看起来
She looks like someone

522
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,410
就像和她情夫一起
who's killed her husband

523
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,180
杀了她丈夫
with the help of her lover

524
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,660
现在正带着
And now she's running off

525
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,150
珠宝在跑路
with the family jewels

526
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,150
你不觉得曲子像她
Don't you think this music's her?

527
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,270
他妈的 没错
Damn, it's true

528
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,740
你看那边那个人
You see that guy over there?

529
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,910
他有心事
He can't forget a thing

530
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,830
听听他的
Listen to his music

531
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,930
他脑中充斥着回忆
His head bursts with memories

532
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,710
却无能为力
and there's nothing he can do about it

533
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,920
再看那个
And look at that one there

534
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,670
她看上去就像
She looks like a prostitute

535
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,380
想变成修女的妓女
who's thinking of becoming a nun

536
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,310
太不可思议了
That's incredible

537
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,610
现在看那个
Now, look at this one

538
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,150
看到他怎么走路了吗
See how he walks?

539
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,700
我说他穿了别人的衣服
I'd say he's in someone else's suit

540
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,920
只要看他穿的方式就知道
judging by the way he wears it

541
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,040
他是偷偷溜进
I'd say he's a stowaway

542
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,340
头等舱的
slipped into first class

543
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,760
寻找不可思议的爱情
Iooking for an amorous adventure

544
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,520
眼睛里散发着美国梦
This one's got America stamped on his eyes

545
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,600
我都能听见他的叫喊
I can already hear him screaming

546
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,940
美国
America!

547
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,030
我要把钱赚回来
I'm going to get my money back

548
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,280
就在今天

549
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,380
单身族  李 克莱尔

你不认识我
You don't know me

551
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,900
但我想
But I was wondering

552
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,610
我们能不能聊会天
if we could have a little chat

553
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:01,260
交谈  谈些什么
A little chat? What about?

554
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,140
随便聊聊  就像天气情况什么的
About anything you like Weather conditions?

555
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,600
你可以随便挑个话题
Anything You pick or chuck the subject

556
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,180
这算淫秽骚扰电话?
Is this an obscene phone call?

557
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,730
上帝啊
Christ

558
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,780
你就是身价20美元的那小子?
You the fish with the twenty-dollar name?

559
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,900
嘿  你要上哪去  我们得谈谈

等等  我们只是想和你谈谈
Wait, we just want to talk to you

562
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,080
你以为你是谁啊
Where the hell are we, man?

563
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,340
别动  你个兔崽子
Hold still you little son of a bitch

564
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,800
出来  我们不想伤害你
Come on out! We don't want to hurt you

565
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,430
我们也是演奏音乐的
We're players, man! Sidemen

566
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,110
挺能躲的啊
Bon appetie

567
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,990
你可以再说一遍  再说一遍  哥
You can say that again, brother You can say that again

568
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,450
你就是那个能把十种爵士融合为一种的人?
You the one that plays ten kinds of jazz rolled into one?

569
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,500
我从不管这些  我只是个弹钢琴的
I've never counted them I'm just a piano player

570
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,090
想想吧  朋友  是创造爵士乐的人让我们来这的
Better start counting, buddy. The man who invented jazz sent us here

571
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,250
是吗
Really?

572
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,090
他想要我干什么
What does he want with me?

573
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,590
他向你发起一场钢琴对决
He challenges you to a piano duel

574
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:44,640
杰里・罗  你为什么要乘蒸汽船环游欧洲
Jello Roll, what's the reason for a trip to Europe on a steamer

575
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,150
你从未上过
when you've never been on anything

576
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,730
比密西西比河船还要大的船吗
bigger than a Mississippi riverboat?

577
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,320
我可不鸟这欧洲
I don't give a damn about Europe

578
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,690
我上这船的唯一原因是
The only reason I'm hopping this crappy tub

579
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,150
因为我要见一位绅士
is because there's a gentleman I want to meet

580
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,700
他们说他钢琴弹得很棒
They say he plays a hot piano

581
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,910
但我听说他从不踏足陆地
But I hear he has a little thing about setting foot on land

582
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,120
他在和我说话吗
Is he talking about me?

583
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,330
反正他正在谈论你
You bet he's talking about you

584
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,630
他说  嘿  杰里
He say, Hey, Jelly

585
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,630
有人弹得比你更好
Someone plays better piano than you

586
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,760
所以我和自己说  那小子能弹得多好啊
So I say to myself, Self how can this cat play so well

587
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,810
他甚至都没种离开那艘屁船
when he don't even have the balls to get off the goddamn ship

588
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,890
嘿  大名人  杰里
Hey, hot damn, Jelly

589
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:31,270
你是爵士乐的鼻祖
You invented jazz

590
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:37,740
我是说  你只要抬起手指随便挥动下
I said, Goddamn you can afford a first-class ticket to Europe

591
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,610
就能负担得起
and the boat that's going to take you

592
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:43,990
一张去欧洲头等船舱的票费
just by lifting a finger Get a shot of it, boys, get a shot

593
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,580
说实话  你害怕吗
Tell the truth. Are you scared?

594
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,040
我不清楚
I don't know

595
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,040
为什么要对决  对决会发生些什么
Why a duel? What happens when you have a duel?

596
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,260
我希望杰里・罗・莫顿有他们说得那么好
I hope this Jelly Roll Morton guy is as good as they say

597
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,550
听说他回美国了
Heard a lot about him back in the States

598
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,000
他是个黑鬼
He's a Negro

599
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,950
我确信
I believe

600
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,280
你坐了我该坐的位置
you're sitting in my seat

601
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,420
你就是那个来弹奏爵士乐的人  对吧
You're the one who invented jazz, right?

602
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,460
他们都那么说
That's what they say

603
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,300
你就是那个
And you're the one

604
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:21,720
只在船上弹奏的家伙?  对吧
who can't play unless you have the ocean under your ass?right?

605
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,640
我这么说
That's what I say

606
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,730
(法语)
(Franch)

607
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,350
杰里・罗・莫顿不是在弹奏
Jelly Roll Morton did not play

608
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,730
他在爱抚这些音符
He caressed those notes

609
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:24,650
听起来就像丝绸划过了女人的肌肤
It sounded like a silk slip sliding down a woman's body

610
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,700
他的手指如蝴蝶般轻盈
His hands were butterflies so light

611
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,700
他开始弹奏那沁人心脾的曲子
He got his start in the famed tenderloin districts of New Orleans

612
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,620
当他在船厅里敲击着键盘
And did he learn to stroke the keyboard in those whorehouses

613
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,040
楼上原本忙碌的人们不再骚动
People doing the deed upstairs didn't want any uproar

614
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,670
他们想要音乐划过窗帘  流过床底
They wanted music to slip behind the curtains and under the beds

615
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,010
没有烦躁的情绪
without disturbing the passion

616
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,420
他弹奏的就是这样的音乐
That's the kind of music he played

617
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,630
在音乐中
And in that

618
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:54,220
他坚信自己才是天下第一
he truly was the best

619
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,330
好极了
Bravo!

620
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,730
轮到你了  水手
Your turn, sailor

621
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,410
加油
Come on

622
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,640
他在做什么
What's he doing?

623
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,820
《平安夜》?
"Silent Night"?

624
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,690
那不是耶诞颂歌吗
Isn't that a Christmas carol?

625
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,490
他知道这是比赛吗
Does he understand it's a contest?

626
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,820
《平安夜》是爵士乐?
"Silenet Night" is jazz?

627
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,120
圣诞不早过了吗
Is it Christmas already?

628
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,350
拜托  杰里・罗弹奏的才是爵士乐
Come on, Jelly Roll show us what jazz is all about

629
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,030
你有毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

630
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,530
我情不自禁的就被音乐感动得哭了
I can't help it. Music makes me cry

631
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:18,740
所有的船员把全年的报酬都赌在你身上了
The whole crew bet on you I put a year's pay on the line

632
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:23,290
现在你停下来想想你的音乐
Now you cut that out and start thinking your music

633
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,250
我也能来打赌吗
Can I bet too?

634
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,960
不行
No!

635
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,330
赌自己会遭厄运的
It's bad luck to bet on yourself

636
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:31,880
我不是想赌自己  我想赌他  他是最棒的了
I don't want to bet on me. I want to bet on him. He's the greatest

637
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,380
你疯了吧  你知道自己在干什么吗
You are crazy, you know that?

638
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,510
如果我输了你就能把钱拿回来
That way, if you lose you'll get your money back

639
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,810
是完全相同的一首曲子  亲爱的
It's exactly the same piece of music, darling

640
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:45,820
真的一模一样
This is really the end of the line

641
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,830
难以置信
Unbelievable

642
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,980
加油啊  你可以比他弹得更好的
Come on you can do better than that

643
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,860
杰里  让他们知道船是怎么沉的
Jelly, show them how to sink a ship

644
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,740
你给我好好听着
You stick this up your ass

645
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,960
嘿  麦克斯
Hey, Max

646
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,010
给我根烟  行吗
Give me a cigarette, will you?

647
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,260
可你连烟都拿不好啊
You're not handling this well

648
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,680
就给我一根烟吧
Just give me a cigarette

649
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,970
可你不抽烟的啊
You don't smoke

650
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:46,510
你是怎么了  你一只手就足以打败他了
What is the matter with you? You could lick this guy with one hand

651
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,100
去啊
Come on

652
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,530
你到底给不给
Are you going to give me a cigarette?

653
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,990
我们将要挖上几百年的煤
We'll be chucking coal a couple hundred years

654
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:10,080
而你只是说...
and all you can say is...

655
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,540
给我一根烟!
Give me a fucking cigarette will you?

656
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,310
混球  你逼我的
You asked for it, asshole

657
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:30,180
你抽吧
You smoke it

658
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,100
我可抽不来
I don't know how

659
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:28,110
杰里・罗・莫顿在剩下的航行时间里把自己锁在船舱内
Jelly Roll Morton spend the rest of that trip locked in his cabin

660
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,520
在到南安普敦时
When we got to Southampton

661
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,990
他离开弗吉尼亚州返回美国
he got off the Virginian and went back to America

662
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:37,820
我记得1900看着他离开码头
I remember Nineteen Hundred watched him as he walked off down the dock

663
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,990
他只说了句
and all he said was

664
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,740
去他的爵士乐
Fuck jazz too

665
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:48,000
他只是说了  去他的爵士乐
And that's just what he said "Fuck jazz too"

666
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,420
这是个令人难以置信的故事
This is an incredible story

667
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,130
我错过什么重要的东西了吗
Did I miss anything important?

668
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:53,130
可以这么说
You couldn say that

669
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,420
靠
Damn

670
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,720
别担心  他以后会告诉你  不是吗
Don't worry, our friend will fill you in later. Won't you?

671
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,680
你可以指望他
You can count on it

672
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,390
谢了  他很擅长讲故事
Thanks He's so good at telling tales

673
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,060
这不是故事  先生
This is no tale, sir

674
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,390
可没人在场
There's nobody here

675
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:07,480
因为我们人太多吓到他了
Because there's too many of us We scared him

676
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,150
如果你再不离开就逮捕你
You leave this ship or I'll have to have you arrested

677
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,150
快回去工作吧
Get back to work. Quickly

678
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:16,730
再给我一次机会吧
Give me another chance

679
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:20,700
走吧  朋友  明天中午以后这船就成历史了
Piss off, friend. Noon tomorrow this ship is history

680
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:31,910
停下  不然我就要开枪了
Stop or I'll shoot

681
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,500
抓到你了
Gotcha

682
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,340
放轻松  是我  波普斯
Pops, easy, it's me

683
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,380
又是你
You again?

684
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,050
是的  放低枪口  好吗
Yes, lower that cannon, will you?

685
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:45,090
找到你的乐器再偷走它
See your instrument and then steal it back again

686
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:48,390
又是这套老把戏  我早应该猜到你是个贼
That's an old trick. I should have guessed that you were a thief

687
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,680
我正在找这个
I was looking for this

688
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,770
你要那个干嘛
And what do you need that for?

689
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,770
这是生死攸关的事  我需要张照片
It's a matter of life and death And I need a phonograph too

690
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,940
你是贼还是骗子
A thief and a liar

691
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,110
波普斯  我没多少时间了
Pops I don't have a whole lot of time

692
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:02,440
是啊  因为我有枪
Well, I do! Seeing as I have a gun

693
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,690
我现在突然想到了这个
And now that I think of it

694
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:07,280
是在船上录制的唱片
since when were records made on board steamships

695
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,120
如果那首曲子是你朋友弹奏的
If that music was played by your friend

696
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,540
这意味着他在此生中曾下过船  对吗
it means that at some time in his life he got off that ship! Correct?

697
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,410
没那机会  波普斯
Not a chance, Pops

698
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,370
他自己一个人录制的
He cut this passionate recording personally

699
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,290
我认为这是他的杰作
I think it's his best work

700
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:24,460
他一秒都没下过船
But he didn't jump ship to do it not even for a second

701
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,510
又没人限制过1900
The sky's the limit Mr. Nineteen Hundred

702
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:31,640
我们相信他的唱片一定能畅销的
If this record sells like hotcakes and we think it will

703
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,180
你会大有前途的  1900先生
you'll go far, Mr. Nineteen

704
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,270
你介意我称呼你做1900吗
Do you mind if I call you Nineteen?

705
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,560
这会伤害到我的  不是吗
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

706
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,980
先生  请准备
Ready now, gentelmen

707
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:44,980
听我数数  1  2  3
On the count. And one, two, three

708
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,400
1900
Nineteen

709
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:49,570
这首曲子真绝了  它叫什么名字
That is one amazing piece of music What is it called?

710
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:53,030
这曲子让人痴迷
It's going to have people crying buckets

711
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,620
它需要一个能吸引人的名字
It's got to have the right title though, something catchy like

712
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:59,370
就像《畅游清风》或者...
"Swinging in the Breeze" or...

713
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,500
太棒了  像这样
Great, as usual

714
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,160
《甜蜜的世纪乐队》  就这样
"Sweet Nineteen," that's it

715
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,580
你就会成为大人物
You are going to be bigtime

716
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,880
你所要做的只是向前跨一大步
And all you got to do is take that big step

717
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:14,550
什么一大步
What big step?

718
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:18,340
下船  离开这恶心的木船跳板
Getting off. Getting off these lousy planks of wood

719
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,890
接下来
and going after...

720
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:24,390
获得你应有的财富和名誉
going after your fame and fortune

721
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:28,190
虽然不一定是你梦寐以求的
I don't mean to butt in fellas, but

722
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:32,440
但只要这样就能得到任何你想要的
with this you can have anything you want

723
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,110
而且不再需要离开船了
and never have to set foot off this boat

724
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,960
我们会复制上百万的副本
We'll print millions of copies

725
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,750
全世界的人们
so that people all over the world

726
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:01,010
都能听到你美妙的旋律  1900
can hear your wonderful music Nineteen

727
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,760
1900先生
Mr. Nineteen?

728
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,600
我不会让我的音乐离我而去
I won't let my music go anywhere without me

729
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,810
不  别碰
No! Don't touch

730
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,430
你在干什么  你不能这样做
What are you doing? You can't do that

731
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:14,520
我们有合约在先  不许反悔
We have a contract You can't go back now

732
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:16,810
我总反悔
I always go back

733
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,540
小姐
Miss

734
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:25,500
我将愉快不已  如果...
I'd be pleased if...

735
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,890
尊敬的  小姐
Miss

736
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:45,230
我将兴奋不已
I'd be thrilled

737
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:50,070
如果你接受这个
if yu'd accept this...

738
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:55,570
小礼物
small token

739
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:09,560
帕多安小姐  你一个人在这干什么  数浪?
Miss Padoan, what are you doing here all alone? Counting the waves?

740
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,680
船长说我们即将穿过北回归线
The captain said we'd be passing the Tropic of Cancer soon

741
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,350
太棒了  我们至少有东西可以瞧瞧了
Great! At least we'll have something to look at

742
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:18,860
你注意过海是怎么变颜色的吗  一天变十次
You ever notice how the sea changes colors? Ten times a day

743
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:20,320
甚至更多
Even more

744
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,110
我会花上一整天看海
I could look at the sea all day long

745
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,030
你知道的  农民从不去看海
You know farmers don't ever look at the sea

746
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:27,740
我听说他们害怕
It scares them At least that's what I heard

747
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,200
那不是真的
That's not true

748
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,830
我爸爸曾经告诉我他听到大海的声音
Once, my father told me he heard the ocean's voice

749
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,870
真的吗  谁说的
Really? What did it say?

750
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:42,290
不能告诉你  这是个秘密  秘密应当要保密
I can't tell you. It's a secret And secrets should be kept

751
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,050
天啊  我们进屋吧  雨下得太大了
Gosh, it's really coming down now Let's get back inside

752
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,010
我搀着您
Let me take your arm

753
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,270
女寝  三层
Women's dormitory 3 class

754
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:58,490
下一个
Next

755
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,240
下一个
Next

756
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:15,170
抱歉
Excuse me

757
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:19,420
借过
Excuse me

758
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,010
借过
Excuse me

759
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:24,510
对不起  小姐
Please, miss

760
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,390
我有话想对你说
I have to talk to you

761
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:33,890
你要去见你的父亲  对吗
You're meeting your father aren't you?

762
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,560
是啊
Yes

763
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,310
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

764
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,150
我觉得我见过他
I think I've met him

765
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,740
就在这船上
On this ship

766
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,530
几年之前
quite a few years ago

767
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:50,490
我不知道他是不是乘了同一艘船
I don't know if he took this same ship

768
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:53,160
我确定
I'm sure of it

769
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,380
他有一支法国的小风笛
He has a musette

770
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:01,880
我们还一起演奏过
I think we played together

771
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:06,420
我不知道他是否还记得
I don't know if he'd remember, but

772
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,880
请代我向他问声好
say hello to him

773
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,340
我会的
I will

774
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:13,970
但你怎么会知道我是谁  很奇怪  不是吗
But how did you know who I was? It's very strange, no?

775
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,810
这是个秘密
It's a secret

776
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:20,440
秘密应当要保密
And secrets should be kept

777
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,570
尽管我认为你父亲回去后会有不同想法
Although I think your father felt differently back then

778
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,210
请接受这个
Please accept this...

779
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:51,760
音乐的小礼物
small musical token

780
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,930
对不起  我听不到
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you

781
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,470
我想要你...
I want you to...

782
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:02,810
接受这份小礼物
accept this small token

783
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,100
我听不到你在说什么
I can't hear you

784
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,480
祝你好运
Good luck

785
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,320
谢谢  也祝你好运
Thank you. Good luck to you too

786
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,990
你为什么不来我们这儿
Why don't you come and visit us some day?

787
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:21,160
我们住在莫特街27号
We live on Mott Street. Number 27

788
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,790
我爸爸有开了家鱼店
My father has a fish shop

789
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,250
可能会来吧
Maybe

790
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:34,800
好的  帕多安  下一个
Padoan, okay. Next

791
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,050
下一个
Next

792
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,790
他再也没有提起她  我也没再问他
He never mentioned her to me again And I never asked

793
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:19,920
至少是后来的12年里
At least not for the next twelve crossings

794
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,260
此外  他快乐依旧
Besides, he was happy just like always

795
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:26,300
他的名气到达了顶峰
His popularity was its peak

796
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:28,640
然后  某个春天的晚上
Then, one evening in spring

797
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:33,600
在途经热那亚到纽约的路上
halfway between Genoa and New York right it the middle of the ocean

798
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,600
到达纽约的三天前
In three days when we get to New York

799
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:40,230
我要离开这船
I'm getting off this ship

800
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,650
怎么不说话了
Cat got your tongue?

801
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:51,120
不  我很高兴
No,I'm glad

802
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,200
怎么会这么突然
But all of a sudden?

803
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,620
兄弟啊...
My man...

804
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,000
你终于开窍了
That's aces

805
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,790
我想要看些东西
I've got to see something down there

806
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,250
看什么
What?

807
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:04,920
大海
The ocean

808
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,930
你开玩笑呢吧
You're pulling my leg

809
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,390
自从你出生那天起
You've seen nothing but the ocean

810
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,850
你就一直对着海着呢
since the day you were born

811
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,640
只从船上看过啊
But from here

812
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,810
我想从陆地上看看海的样子
I want to see it from there

813
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:21,350
换个角度  和从船上看根本就是两码事
It's not the same thing at all

814
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,360
那你就等我们靠岸的时候
Wait till we dock lean over the side

815
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,840
好好看看吧
take a good look

816
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,320
其实都一样
It's the same thing

817
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,990
不  不一样的
No, it's not

818
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:31,050
在岸上  你是可以听到大海的声音的
From land, you can hear its voice

819
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:33,110
那是一种无法从船上听到的声音
You don't hear that from a ship

820
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:36,330
什么叫"大海的声音"啊
What do you mean, its voice?

821
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,290
大海的声音
Its voice

822
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,790
就像...
It's like...

823
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:48,000
就像是一声震耳欲聋的惊叫
a big scream...

824
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,840
像对生命的广博的惊叹
telling you that life is immense

825
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,220
一旦你聆听过这样的声音  你就会知道
Once you've heard it, then you know

826
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:59,390
怎么样才有继续生活下去的动力和激情
what you have to do to go on living

827
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:03,310
虽然我可以永远待在船上
I could stay here forever

828
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:07,480
但这样大海是不会给我任何启示的
But the ocean would never tell me a thing

829
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,440
倘若我下船  去陆地上感受几年  生活几年
But if I get off live on land for a couple of years

830
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,740
我就会是正常的了
then I'll be normal

831
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,400
像其他人一样
just like the others

832
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,490
然后或许有一天
Then maybe one day

833
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:23,580
我会到海岸边去  仰望大海  瞧瞧它的样子
I'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean

834
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,870
然后聆听大海的咆哮
and hear it scream

835
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:29,370
我不知道这些乱七八糟的都是谁告诉你的
I don't know who's been telling you this bullshit

836
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:31,330
或者是你自己莫名其妙的想出来的
or if you're just making it up

837
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,090
但是你想知道我的想法吗
But you want to know what I think?

838
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,380
我的想法就是...
I think...

839
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:40,380
真正让你有下船的冲动的原因  是那个女孩
the real reason you want off this ship is the girl

840
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:42,430
只有那个女孩是你想下船的原因
It's always the girl

841
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:46,100
但就算不是这个原因的话我也无所谓
But even if it's not the reason that suits me just fine

842
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,140
因为我一直都想让你离开这艘船
Because I've always wanted you to leave this ship

843
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,140
为陆地上的观众演奏
and play for the people on land

844
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:54,770
然后再娶个好妻子  成家立业  儿孙满堂
and marry a nice woman and have children

845
01:32:54,770 --> 01:33:00,990
我希望你能拥有的是那些生命中不那么"广博"的
and all those things in life which are not immense

846
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:03,410
但却是值得你为之奋斗的
but are worth the effort

847
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:09,410
你会来看我吧  麦克斯  去陆地上我的家
You'll come visit me won't you, Max? On land?

848
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,040
当然了
Of course

849
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:15,290
我去看你的时候  你要向我介绍
That way, you'll introduce me

850
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,710
你孩子的母亲
to the mother of your children

851
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:20,880
还要邀请我和你们一起共进星期日的晚餐
And invite me for Sunday dinner

852
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,010
我会带些甜点外加一瓶酒
I'll bring the dessert and a bottle of wine

853
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:27,430
然后你就会对我说用不着这么客气
and you'll tell me I shouldn't have

854
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:30,260
当你向我介绍带着我参观
and while you're showing me around

855
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,100
你那所建的似船一样的房子
your house shaped like a ship

856
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,730
你妻子在为大家烤火鸡
your wife will be cooking a turkey

857
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:37,190
然后我们都会坐在桌旁
And then we'll sit at the table

858
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:40,980
我会夸赞她的厨艺
and I'll tell her she's an excellent cook

859
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:44,980
她会对我说你总会对她提起有关于我的事
and she'll say how you talk about me all the time

860
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:52,660
知道么  我打算把我的骆驼大衣送你了
You know I'm going to give you my camel coat

861
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,790
等你下船的时候你穿着它肯定特帅
You'll cut a fine figure when you get down there

862
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:00,480
我见过无数次人们在
How many people I have seen

863
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,170
在码头上互相道别之后却
saying goodbye on the docks

864
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:04,210
立即转身离去  神色漠然
without giving a damn

865
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:07,610
但是当我与1900到了说再见的时候
But when I said goodbye to Nineteen Hundred

866
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:10,130
道别却成了最伤感的事情
it was a real blow

867
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:13,470
虽然我们互相笑着说"回见"
We laughed and kept saying "See you soon"

868
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:18,100
但是我们都心知肚明  分离即永别
But inside we both knew we'd never see each other again

869
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,570
再见了  1900  多保重
Goodbye, Nineteen Hundred! Take care

870
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:39,660
祝你好运  好好玩
Good luck Have a good time

871
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,870
保重  1900  千万保重
Take care Nineteen Hundred, take care

872
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:46,460
时不时地给我们写信啊
Write us a letter sometimes

873
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,790
代我向百老汇问好啊
Give my regards to Broadway

874
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:24,740
他怎么了  踩着屎了不成
What'd he do, step in shit?

875
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:27,450
说不定他忘拿什么东西了吧
Maybe he just forgot something

876
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:29,830
也有可能忘了为何下船
Maybe he's forgotten why he's getting off

877
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,930
你想怎么样
What do you want?

878
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,480
从那以后  很长一段时间  他都怪怪的
He was strange for a long time after that

879
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:31,650
不跟任何人讲话
He wouldn't talk to anyone

880
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:36,240
一天一天  沉默寡言
He preferred keeping to himself for days and days

881
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,700
他似乎沉浸在了某件心事中
He seemed taken by very personal matters

882
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:45,370
然后有一天  当我坐在酒吧里的时候
Then one day while I was sitting at the bar

883
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,130
谢谢你的大衣了  麦克斯  很合身
Thanks for the coat, Max.Fit like a glove

884
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,300
上次太可惜了
It was a real shame

885
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:05,350
现在感觉好多了  我不再想着下船的事了
I'm much better now I'm done with all that

886
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:25,580
仿若时光倒流啊
Just like old times

887
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:44,470
1933年8月21日  我离开了维珍尼亚号
I left the Virginian on August 21st, 1933

888
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:49,060
我拿着我的离开文件和被拖欠薪水  就这么离开了
with my leave papers and back pay everything in order

889
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,720
我知道自己迟早会
I knew that sooner or later

890
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,390
结束我的海上生活的
I'd have been through with the ocean

891
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:54,350
所以我决定开始我的陆上生活
So that's what I did

892
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:57,270
我再也没有听说过任何
I heard no more about

893
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:59,360
有关于1900或维珍尼亚号的消息
Nineteen Hundred or the Virginian

894
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,730
但我从未忘却他们
Not that I ever forgot them

895
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,900
反而
On the contrary

896
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,990
战争期间的时候我总会问自己
During the war I'd always ask myself

897
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:08,840
谁知道如果1900在的话
Who knows what Nineteen Hundred would do

898
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,700
他会怎么做呢
if he were here?

899
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,240
说些什么
Who knows what he'd say?

900
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,750
也许他会说"去他妈的战争"吧
Fuck war, he'd say

901
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:20,380
但这话从一我这说出口就变味了
But said by me it wasn't the same thing

902
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,060
时过境迁了  懂吗
A lot of time's gone by, you know

903
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,560
谁敢说他真的从没下过船呢
who's to say he really didn't leave

904
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,890
说不定他真的去过那家卖鱼的店里
Maybe he actually went to the fish shop

905
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:44,230
问候过那个女人呢
and asked for that woman

906
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:45,690
说不定吧
Maybe

907
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,340
你怎么了  晕船吗
What's the matter? You lose your sea legs?

908
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,640
你到底在哪找到那张唱片的
Where the hell did you find that record?

909
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:29,560
这些年你都做什么了
What have you been up to all these years

910
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:37,740
创造音乐
Making music

911
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:40,320
甚至战争时期也在做吗
Even during the war?

912
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:48,040
即使再也没人跳舞的时候
Even when no one was dancing anymore

913
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,420
即使炸弹四处飞的时候
Even when the bombs were falling

914
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,710
我一直都在演奏  没有停歇
And I kept playing

915
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:01,130
直到船驶到了这里
till the ship got here

916
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:07,600
你还叫它船啊
Call this a ship?

917
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,560
这东西比起船更像是个装满炸药即将爆炸的山
It's more like a mountain of dynamite about to explode

918
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:16,520
你不觉得有点危险吗
A bit dangerous, don't you think?

919
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,650
你呢  麦克斯
And you, Max?

920
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:27,780
你的小号呢
Where's your trumpet?

921
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:32,040
我很久以前就不吹小号了
I gave it up as well, as while back

922
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:37,210
但是  你知道  现在我又想重新开始吹了
But, you know, now I'm in the mood for starting again

923
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,920
现在我脑袋里全是新点子
I'm busting with new ideas

924
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,010
咱们一起组个二重奏吧  你和我
Let's start a duo. You and me

925
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:48,800
或者组个我们自己的乐队
Or our own band

926
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,600
乐队名就叫  丹尼 博德曼
The Danny Boodman

927
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:55,470
T.D・雷蒙 1900 大乐队怎么样
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred Big Band

928
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:57,480
这名字让人热血沸腾吧
It's gets the blood going

929
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,480
我们肯定会特别火
We'd be a smash

930
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:06,480
来吧  1900  和我一起  我们下船吧
Come on, Nineteen Hundred Come with me. Let's get off

931
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,780
我们可以在码头那看烟花
We'll watch the fireworks from the pier

932
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:11,450
然后我们从零开始
and then we'll start from scratch

933
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:16,040
有时候从零开始是必要的
Sometimes that's the way you have to do it

934
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:19,250
你得回到起点
You go right back to the beginning

935
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:33,090
这并不是结束
You're never really done for...

936
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:39,640
除非你有了一段可以拿出去讲给他人听的故事才是结束
as long as you've got a good story and someone to tell it to

937
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:40,970
记得吗
Remember?

938
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:45,060
那是你告诉我的
You told me that

939
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:51,940
看吧  你现在的故事可真是都可以写成一本书了
Well, what a stack of stories you got now

940
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:57,160
全世界都会对你的每一个字洗耳恭听的
The world would be hanging on your every word

941
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:00,740
世界会为你的音乐而疯狂
crazy for your music

942
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,950
相信我
Believe me

943
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,830
整座城市
All that city

944
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,170
你根本无法看到它的尽头
You just couldn't see an end to it

945
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:21,340
尽头
The end...

946
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:24,850
拜托
please?

947
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:28,020
你能告诉我哪里才是城市的尽头吗
You please just show me where it ends?

948
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:36,690
在跳板上我还觉得自己很好  一切都还好
It was all very fine on that gangway. And I was grand too

949
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:39,240
穿着我的那件大衣
in my overcoat

950
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,280
我确实看起来很有型
I cut quite a figure

951
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,370
然后我确实打算要下去
And I was getting off

952
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:47,160
我发誓
Guaranteed

953
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:50,710
那并不是我最终回身上船的原因
That's wasn't the problem

954
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:58,670
并不是我所看到的让我停下了脚步  麦克斯
It wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max

955
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,510
让我停下脚步的是我所没有看到的
It was what I didn't see

956
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:05,430
明白吗
Understand?

957
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:09,140
我所看不到的
What I didnt' see

958
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:12,390
城市里纵横交错的街道
In all that srawling city

959
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:14,730
除了尽头  什么都有
there was everything except an end

960
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:18,270
那里没有尽头
There was no end

961
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:23,630
我所看不到的是
What I did not see was

962
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:26,610
我下船之后的未来
was where the whole thing came to an end

963
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:30,320
我看不到世界的尽头
The end of the world

964
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:39,920
用钢琴打比方
You take a piano

965
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:44,300
钢琴键就是
Keys begin

966
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,170
有始有终的
The keys end

967
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:49,720
你也很清楚明了的知道钢琴一共有88个键
You know there are 88 of them

968
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,970
没有人能对此提出异议
Nobody can tell you any different

969
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:54,350
没有无限的因素在里面
They are not infinite

970
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:58,140
你才是那个无限的因素的主导
You are infinite

971
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,540
在那些琴键上
And on those keys

972
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,940
你演奏出来的音乐才有万千变化
the music that you can make is infinite

973
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,570
我喜欢这样
I like that

974
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:08,610
我只能过这样的生活
That I can live by

975
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,570
你把我弄到那个跳板上
You get me up on that gangway

976
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:11,900
然后你突然在我面前扔了一个
and you roll out in front of me

977
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:15,820
上面有着万千琴键的键盘
a keyboard of millions and billions of keys that never end

978
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:17,910
这就是我不能下船的原因  麦克斯
and that's the truth Max

979
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:20,000
是因为他们无穷无尽
that they never end

980
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,120
那个键盘本身就是无穷无尽的
That keyboard is infinite

981
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:26,080
而如果键盘是无穷无尽的话
And if that keyboard is infinite

982
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,500
那么在上面演奏音乐是不可能的
then there is no music you can play

983
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:32,050
你根本就没有站在合适的位置上
You're sitting on the wrong bench

984
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,130
那是上帝的钢琴
That's God's piano

985
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:41,350
天啊  你看到那些街道了吗  只是街道
Christ, did you see the streets? Just the streets.

986
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:44,140
就有成百上千条
There were thousands of them

987
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:46,680
你如何能在那里生活
How do you do it down there?

988
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:49,230
你如何从那么多中间选择
How do you choose just one?

989
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,690
一个女人
One woman

990
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,610
一幢房子
One house

991
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,130
一小块你可以看着的称之为
One piece of land to call

992
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:59,570
自己的风景的土地
your own one landscape to look at

993
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:01,490
还有一种死亡的方式
one way to die?

994
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:08,160
那整个世界都只是重压在你身上
All that world just weighing down on you

995
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,250
你甚至不知道什么时候才是结束  是尽头
You don't even know where it comes to an end

996
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:12,380
我是说  难道你从来都没害怕自己会
I mean, aren't you ever just scared of

997
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,340
因为想到这个就崩溃吗
breaking apart at the thought of it?

998
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:17,010
甚至只是想想生活在其中  就不寒而栗吗
At the enormity of living it?

999
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,800
我是生在这艘船上的
I was born on this ship

1000
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:28,140
我已经和这个世界擦身而过了
And the world passed me by

1001
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:32,730
但是每次这里都会容纳两千人
But two thousand people at a time

1002
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,900
而且还承载了人们的愿望
And there were wishes here

1003
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:43,740
但是没有比船头和船尾之间更适合的了
But never more than fit between prow and stern

1004
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:46,160
你演奏出了自己的快乐幸福
You played out your happiness

1005
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:48,580
但那是在一架有始有终的钢琴上
but on a piano that was not infinite

1006
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:51,540
那就是我所学会的生活方式
I learned to live that way

1007
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:56,960
陆地
Land?

1008
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:02,880
陆地对我来说是一艘太大的船
Land is a ship too big for me

1009
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:08,550
是一个太过于美丽的女人
It's a woman too beautiful

1010
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:12,680
是一段太长的航程
It's a voyage too long

1011
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:15,180
是太过于浓烈的香水
perfume too strong

1012
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:20,360
是我不会弹奏的曲子
It's music I don't know how to make

1013
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,730
我永远都不能离开这艘船
I could never get off this ship

1014
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:28,320
最不济
At best

1015
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,240
我还能退出生命的舞台
I can step off my life

1016
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,540
毕竟
After all

1017
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:38,120
我不为任何人而存在
I don't exist for anyone

1018
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,750
你是例外  麦克斯
You're the exception, Max

1019
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:49,800
你是唯一知道我在这里的人
You're the only one who knows I'm here

1020
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,470
你是少数
You're a minority

1021
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:57,220
而且你最好习惯它
And you'd better get used to it

1022
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:03,650
原谅我  我的朋友
Forgive me, my friend

1023
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:08,020
我是不会下船的
but I'm not getting off

1024
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,980
麦克斯
Hey, Max

1025
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,650
想像一下在天国的门前
Picture the scene at the Golden Gates

1026
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:43,590
有个人看着名单  试图找到我的名字
Some guy searching a list trying to find my name

1027
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,530
却找不到
not finding it

1028
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:48,410
"再说一遍你叫什么"
What did you say your name was again?

1029
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:50,490
1900
Nineteen Hundred

1030
01:52:50,490 --> 01:52:55,410
尼曼  南丁格尔   纳音斯达克...
Niemann, Nightingale, Ninestock...

1031
01:52:55,410 --> 01:52:56,580
尼齐丁
Nittledeen?

1032
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:00,170
你看  先生  我是在船上出生的
Well, you see, sir I was born on a ship

1033
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:01,380
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

1034
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,710
我在船上生  在船上长  在船上结束生命
Born, raised, and died on a ship

1035
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:06,050
说不定你的册子里没我的名字
Maybe I'm not registered there

1036
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:09,340
你是死在船上的
Shipwreck?

1037
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:13,470
六吨半的炸药炸的
Six and a half tons of dynamite Boom

1038
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:16,890
现在感觉好多了吧
Feeling better now?

1039
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:21,650
是啊  感觉还不错  除了少了条胳膊
Yeah, I'm fine except I lost an arm

1040
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:23,440
少胳膊
An arm?

1041
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,860
对  炸飞了
Yes, in the explosion

1042
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:31,530
没事  你能在那找到条新胳膊
Well, you should be able to find one over there

1043
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:33,870
你少了哪条胳膊
Which one did you say you were missing?

1044
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:35,700
左边的  先生
Left, sir

1045
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:40,830
十分抱歉
I'm dreadfully sorry

1046
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:44,380
我们这里似乎只剩下两条右胳膊了
we only seem to have two rights

1047
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:45,750
只有两条右胳膊
Two right arms?

1048
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:49,590
恐怕是这样
Afraid so

1049
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:54,220
你介不介意如果...
Would you mind awfully if...

1050
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:56,180
如果我什么
If I what?

1051
01:53:56,180 --> 01:54:00,680
如果你能接受用一条右胳膊替代左边的
Well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?

1052
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:06,600
那么  好像就算只有右胳膊也比
Well, all things considered better

1053
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:09,730
什么都没有强  我想是这样
a right arm than nothing, I suppose

1054
01:54:09,730 --> 01:54:12,230
双手赞成
Couldn't agree more

1055
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:16,860
笑也没用  麦克斯
No laughing matter, Max

1056
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,330
糟糕啊
What a cock-up

1057
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:25,080
下辈子得一直过只有两条右胳膊的生活
Spend eternity with two right arms?

1058
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,710
我说  你要怎么用胳膊做出十字的形状啊
I mean, how would you make the sign of the cross?

1059
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,060
麦克斯
Hey, Max

1060
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:49,100
想象一下我用两条右胳膊弹奏的钢琴曲吧
Imagine the music I could play with two right arms

1061
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:53,150
希望我能在上面找着架钢琴
Hope I can find a piano up there

1062
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:37,700
如果你是我要怎么办
What would you have done in my shoes?

1063
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:41,040
我不知道
I don't know

1064
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:48,630
不会觉得自己这么没用
I wouldn't probably have felt quite useless

1065
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:57,760
迟早  所有的故事总会有一个结局的
Sooner or later, all stories end

1066
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:00,600
然后就再也没有可以添加的东西
and there's nothing left to add

1067
01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:08,900
不管怎样  谢谢了
Anyhow, thanks, pops

1068
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:29,540
康
Conn

1069
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:33,460
有一件事我不明白
There's just one thing I don't get

1070
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:37,920
是谁把坏掉的唱片藏在钢琴里的
Who hid the broken record inside the piano?

1071
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,720
那人远在天边  近在眼前啊
You're looking at him

1072
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:45,310
那你还不是一点都没用啊
So you weren't so useless after all

1073
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:53,980
康
Conn

1074
01:57:57,940 --> 01:57:59,230
给
Here

1075
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:04,820
把你的小号带走吧
Take your trumpet

1076
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,740
你会需要的
Well, you'll be needing it

1077
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:13,710
别担心  不要钱
Never mind the money

1078
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:17,460
一个好故事比这个旧小号值多了
A good story's worth more than an old trumpet

1079
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:26,880
谢谢
Okay, pops
