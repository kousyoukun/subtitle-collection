The year is 517 A.D.,

18
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,900
史稱黑暗時代
known as the Dark Ages

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,240
而名字的來由顯而易見
and for fucking good reason.

20
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,340
一場人類軍隊與黑暗生物之間
An endless war between the armies of man

21
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,190
永無休止的戰爭
and the creatures of darkness

22
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,990
席捲了英國
has raged across Britain.

23
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,680
為了報復人類對黑暗生物的不公之舉
And in retribution for man's injustices to creatures,

24
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,950
永生不死的女巫薇薇安·妮繆
the immortal witch Vivienne Nimue

25
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,320
傳播了致命的瘟疫
had spread her deadly plague

26
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,160
威脅要把人類從地球上徹底消滅

於是在彭德爾山上  一棵古老的橡樹下
And so at Pendle Hill, beneath an ancient oak tree,

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,790
亞瑟王  沒錯  就是那個亞瑟王
King Arthur... Yes, that King Arthur,

30
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,940
和他法術高強的巫師梅林
and his powerful wizard Merlin,

31
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,430
被迫向血皇后妮繆投降
were forced to surrender to Nimue, the Queen of Blood.

32
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,370
看看這是誰
Well, well, well.

33
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,820
偉大的亞瑟王駕臨彭德爾山
The great King Arthur comes to Pendle Hill.

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,300
然而  帶著深信人類與怪物
However, believing man and monster

35
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,090
永遠也無法和睦共處的想法
were never meant to live in harmony,

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,880
亞瑟偷襲了妮繆
Arthur ambushed Nimue.

37
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,220
而她最信任的女巫戈內達背叛了她
Betrayed by her most trusted witch, Ganeida.

38
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,890
凡人的兵器傷不了我
No mortal weapon can harm me.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,730
-王者之劍  -這可不是凡人的兵器
- Excalibur! - This is no mortal weapon.

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,860
盛怒之下
Pissed off,

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,820
妮繆釋放了致命的瘟疫
Nimue unleashed her deadly plague.

42
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,560
不
No!

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,620
輕輕一揮
With one swing

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,470
傳說中的王者之劍
of his legendary sword,

45
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,830
亞瑟砍下了血皇后之首
Arthur severed the Blood Queen's head.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,430
即便如此  也無法阻止她
But even that wasn't enough to stop her.

47
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,250
所以他將血皇后砍碎
So he had her cut up into pieces,

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,890
並將每一塊都分別鎖在不同的棺材裡
each one locked in a separate casket.

49
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,750
一切尚未結束  我永生永世都要復仇
This is not over. I am vengeance eternal!

50
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,970
不
No!

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,690
神聖的禱告者將其封印
Sealed with a holy prayer.

52
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,430
只有聖徒的言語才能打破這道聖印
Only the words from a man of God may break this holy seal.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,630
隨後  亞瑟命令其最勇敢的騎士們騎馬離去
Arthur then ordered his bravest knights to ride off

54
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,050
將她邪惡的殘骸埋葬在大地盡頭
and bury her wretched remains in the far reaches of the land,

55
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,210
沒有人能找到的地方
where no one would ever find her.

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,100
即使是魔鬼本尊也無濟於事
Not even the devil himself.

57
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,830
{\an8}地獄男爵

58
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,720
我是認真的  兒子
I mean it, son.

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,580
不準喝酒  不準打架  不要挑事
No drinking, no fighting, don't cause a scene.

60
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,720
{\an8}提華納
今時今日

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,760
爸  別緊張  我又不是第一次來提華納
Relax, Dad. It's not my first time in Tijuana.

62
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,590
你以為我為什麼要跟你說這些
Why do you think I'm telling you all this?

63
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,080
魯伊茲是我朋友  我只是想把他帶回來
Ruiz is my friend. I just wanna bring him back.

64
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,970
魯伊茲探員不是你朋友
Agent Ruiz is not your friend.

65
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,760
他只是你的一個酒友
He's someone you get drunk with.

66
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,560
三周前
Three weeks ago,

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,350
我們派魯伊茲探去調查一個吸血鬼巢穴
we sent Ruiz to investigate a nest of vampires.

68
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,960
自那之後  他就沒消息了
We haven't heard from him since.

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
交給我
I'm on it.

70
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,510
我收到可靠消息  知道在哪能找到他
A reliable source told me where I can find him.

71
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,650
找到他就打給我
Call me when you have him.

72
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,520
我不會打給你的
I'm not going to call you.

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,770
打給我  這是個簡單的尋人任務
Just call me! It's a simple extraction.

74
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,800
帶魯伊茲離開那裡
Get Ruiz out of there

75
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
說聲再見就閃人  別又把事情搞大了
and bid adios without making a big mess. Again.

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
交給我  爸

我們能走了嗎
Can we get out of here?

114

他們對你做了什麼
What did they do to you?

115

魯伊茲  我們去喝杯酒好好聊聊
Ruiz! Let's have a drink and talk about this!

116
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,750
你是個好探員
You're a good agent!

兄弟  別這樣  你不記得了嗎
Buddy, come on. Come on, don't you remember?

118
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,730
我們在後院  坐在門廊喝啤酒
Backyards? Drinking beers on the porch?

119
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,620
我們還一起彈過吉他呢
We used to play guitar, man!

120
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,550
雖然你彈的都是不插電的嬉皮士垃圾
You-you'd play all that hippy acoustic crap

121
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,090
而我彈的才叫音樂
and I'd play real music.

122
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,020
去你媽的

你沒事吧
Are you okay?

125
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,590
別這樣  我不想弄傷你  搭檔
Come on, I don't wanna hurt you, partner.

126
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,050
我知道你還沒有完全迷失  回應我一下
I know you're in there somewhere. Talk to me.

127
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,360
你喜歡扮英雄
You play the hero,

128
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,870
但我知道面具之下你的真面目
but I really know what is under your mask.

129
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,080
是嗎  那我們就揭開你的面具看看吧
Oh, yeah? Is that so? Let's see what's under yours.

130
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,710
魯伊茲  別鬧了
Ruiz! Stop this!

131

我認識你  阿努·恩·羅摩
I know you... Anung un Rama.

134
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,310
你的心因憤怒而跳動
Your heart beats with rage.

135
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,130
我知道你最終會選擇哪一邊
I know which side you'll choose at the end.

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
對不起
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,340
對不起  我不是故意的  我...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I...

138
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,780
{\an2}終結即將來臨...

139
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,270
沒關係  小傢伙
That's okay, little guy.

140
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,220
你只是生性如此
You're just doing what you're doing.

141
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,820
我不會怪你的
I'm not judging.

地獄男爵
Hellboy.

143

不  我是喬什
No, it's Josh.

144
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,920
我經常被人認錯
People confuse us all the time.

145
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,370
來吧  我們得走了
Come on, we gotta go.

146
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,870
你是怎麼找到我的
How did you find me?

147
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,310
推特  你可算不上低調
Twitter. You don't exactly blend.

148
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,770
魯伊茲的事我很遺憾  但我們得帶你回去
Look, sorry about Ruiz, but we gotta take you back.

149
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,930
你們可以試試
You can try!

150
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,380
別這樣  大塊頭  別激動
Come on, big guy. Easy.

151
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,930
我們只是奉命行事
We're just following orders.

152
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,630
他想要你回去
He wants you back.

153
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,170
是老頭派你們來的
The old man sent you?

154
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,180
他只跟我們說事關重要
All he told us is its important.

155
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,260
我們得走了
We need to go.

156
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,190
{\an2}朋友

157
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,140
{\an2}再給我拿一瓶

158
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,490
他們買單
They're buying.

159
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,210
{\an8}科羅拉多州

160
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,640
{\an8}超自然調查防禦局

161
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,580
{\an8}弗吉尼亞·佩恩
維克托·凱斯特勒
埃斯特班·魯伊茲

162
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,300
{\an8}超自然調查防禦局

163
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,550
墨西哥的悲劇事件
Details are still emerging

164
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,910
仍不斷有細節浮出水面
with regard to the tragic events in Mexico.

165
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,700
關於地獄男爵  以及他效力的
There's very little information known about Hellboy

166
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,220
神秘機構  我們知之甚少
or the secretive agency that apparently he works for.

167
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,260
你漏了一塊  我來吧
You missed a spot. May I?

168
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,060
爸
Dad.

169
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,540
我父親常說
My father used to say

170
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,870
刮鬍子是一天之中最重要的事
shaving was the most important part of a day.

171
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,020
這是紳士和非利士人的區別
Separated the gentlemen from the Philistines.

172
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,020
{\an8}愛琴海中的島民

173
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,110
只有真男人才會每天拿著刀
It takes a real man to hold a blade

174
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,250
抵在自己的喉嚨上
against his own throat every day

175
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,300
卻不割斷頸靜脈
and not cut the jugular.

176
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,860
布魯姆爺爺
Grandpa Bruttenholm,

177
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,050
他心中儘是泰迪熊和彩虹
he was all teddy bears and rainbows.

178
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,210
他是個冥頑不靈的混蛋
He was an unrepentant asshole,

179
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,540
但是他教會了我怎麼刮鬍子
but he taught me how to shave.

180
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,160
有其父必有其子
Like father, like son.

181
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,420
在龍舌蘭酒裡爛醉三周
Drowning in tequila for three weeks

182
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,310
也許能暫時麻痺傷痛
may temporarily numb the pain.

183
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,620
但其實只會加劇你的悲傷
All it ever really does is exacerbate your sorrows

184
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,180
惡化你的肝臟
and the state of your liver.

185
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,610
我知道魯伊茲探員的事讓你很難過
I know you're upset about Agent Ruiz,

186
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,100
但這份工作就是這樣
but it's part of the job.

187
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,480
大家都明白這一點
Everyone here knows that.

188
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,060
是我殺了他  不是工作
Job didn't kill him, I did.

189
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,900
我在聖母瓜達盧佩教堂邊上
And I buried him 16 feet under the earth

190
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,640
把他埋在了十六英尺深的地下
right by the chapel of the Virgin Guadalupe,

191
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,740
為了能讓他安息
just to make it proper.

192
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,200
他變成了邪惡的吸血鬼
He had become unholy, a vampyre,

193
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
無可救藥的黑暗生物
a creature of darkness beyond salvation.

194
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,930
無可救藥的黑暗生物
A creature of darkness beyond salvation?

195
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,970
你是說不是每個人都能像我一樣偶爾
You mean, we don't all just deserve a little gentle horn shave

196
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,040
-磨一磨角嗎  -你不一樣
- every now and then? - You're different.

197
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,170
你一直都與眾不同
You always have been.

198
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,470
如果我的臉能說話  一定會反對你
If my face could talk, it would disagree with you.

199
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,280
我認為你的臉很帥氣
I think it's a beautiful face.

200
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,870
終結即將來臨  什麼終結
The end is coming. The end of what?

201
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,560
我不知道  這是魯伊茲的臨終遺言
I don't know. Those were Ruiz's last words.

202
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,310
還有什麼阿努·恩...
That and something about Anung nun...

203
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,030
你有印象嗎
Does it ring any bells?

204
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,930
沒  世界末日的胡言亂語
Nah. Apocalyptic mutterings.

205
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,110
好了  真是帥氣逼人
Now there... Don't you look handsome!

206
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,400
我相信你的話  老爸
I'm gonna take your word for that, Pops.

207
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,200
話說  你為什麼叫我回來
Why'd you bring me back, anyway?

208
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,370
別說是因為你想我了
Don't tell me it's 'cause you miss me.

209
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,040
你還記得俄賽裡斯會社嗎
Do you recall the Osiris Club?

210
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,100
記得  澤西島的脫衣舞俱樂部
Yeah. Strip joint in Jersey.

211
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,020
不是  另一個
No, the other one.

212
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,940
太陽神厄裡奧皮克兄弟協會的資深成員
The British occult society formed in 1866

213
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,970
在1866年成立的英國秘會
by the ranking members of the Heliopic Brotherhood of Ra.

214
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,920
太陽神  我在陰間見過太陽神一次
Ra? I met Ra once in the underworld.

215
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,300
他喜歡近距離和人說話
He's a close-talker.

216
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,170
和我們一樣  他們也對抗黑暗勢力
You know, like us, they fight against the forces of darkness

217
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,390
我們的組織之間有長期的合作關係
and our organizations have a long-standing relationship.

218
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,820
他們是我的老朋友
They're old friends of mine.

219
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,390
他們想請你幫忙解決一個巨大的問題
And they've requested your assistance with a giant problem.

220
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,370
-是嗎  什麼問題  -巨人
- Oh, yeah? What's that? - Giants.

221
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,280
地獄男爵剝奪了我可能擁有的生活
Hellboy stole the life I might've had.

222
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,530
把我放逐到這個悲慘的境地
Banished me into an existence of misery.

223
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,600
現在我活著就是為了殺他
I now only live to kill him.

224
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,730
我也遭受過地獄男爵的摧殘
I too have suffered at Hellboy's hands,

225
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,770
所以我瞭解你的痛苦
so I know your pain.

226
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,720
我感同身受  所以我召喚你前來
I felt yours, so I summoned you here.

227
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,920
我會帶你去找一位女巫  薇薇安·妮繆
I will guide you to a witch, Vivienne Nimue,

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,590
雖然被砍碎  但她還活著並持機等待
cut to pieces but alive and waiting.

229
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,990
復原她
Restore her!

230
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,190
她會讓你再次強大起來
She will make you powerful again

231
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,910
這樣你就能復仇了
so you can have your vengeance.

232
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,410
-謝謝你  -過程會很艱難
- I thank you. - This is not going to be easy.

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,270
也許如此
Maybe not.

234
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,230
但是為了恢復力量  我能做到
But to be whole again, I can do it.

235
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,720
去吧
Go now.

236
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,710
我不明白  這事對你有什麼好處
I don't get it. What's in it for you?

237
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,830
這就不用你操心了  野獸
That is no concern of yours, beast!

238
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,500
最終  我自有安排
In the end, I'll have my way

239
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,540
而地獄男爵將會付出代價
and Hellboy will pay what he owes.

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,250
{\an8}英國

241
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,970
{\an8}俄賽裡斯會社

242
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,060
您的客人到了  閣下
Your guest, m'lord.

243
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,450
地獄男爵  歡迎  我是亞當·格拉倫勛爵
Hellboy, welcome. Lord Adam Glaren.

244
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,550
請容我為你介紹我的同僚
And may I introduce my associates,

245
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,840
艾德文·卡普博士和奧古斯特·斯溫
Dr. Edwin Carp and August Swain.

246
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,730
你們好  你們去過澤西島的俄賽裡斯俱樂部嗎
Hi. You guys ever been to the Osiris Club in Jersey?

247
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,740
和這裡差不多  不過那裡有脫衣舞女郎
It's like this, but just with strippers.

248
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,590
我可以摸嗎
May I?

249
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,390
有何特別之處嗎
Does it do anything special?

250
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,230
嗯  砸起東西來得心應手
Yeah, it smashes things real good.

251
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,940
我們很高興你接受了我們的邀請
We are so very glad you accepted our invitation.

252
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,570
我沒得可選
Wasn't really my choice.

253
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,970
是的  教授讓你來的
Yes. The Professor.

254
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,290
我和你父親是老相識了
Your father and I go back a long way.

255
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,310
我有所耳聞
Yeah, I heard.

256
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,810
俄賽裡斯會社一直致力於保存
The Osiris Club has been long dedicated to preserving

257
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,560
大不列顛的秘史
the secret history of Great Britain.

258
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,780
對於像你這樣的人  會社為我們
It affords us certain insights

259
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,710
提供了獨到的見解
into individuals such as yourself.

260
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,210
我們有時也會向你們超自然調查防禦局
We've also given vital counsel

261
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,320
提供重要的建議
to your B.P.R.D. on occasion.

262
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,170
聽著  我們別廢話了好嗎
Look, maybe we could just get on with it.

263
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,800
除非你們讓我飛越了半個地球
Unless you flew me halfway around the world

264
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,630
只是為了給我上一堂歷史課
just so that we could, uh, have a little history lesson.

265
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,340
或許我們應該直接展示給你看
Perhaps we should just show you.

266
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,390
暗門
Secret door.

267
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,510
巨人曾經統治過不列顛群島
Giants once dominated the British Isles.

268
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,820
一群邪惡的  令人作嘔的生物
Vile, loathsome creatures.

269
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,360
既可能看你一眼  又可能一口吃掉你
As likely to eat you as look at you.

270
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,820
它們一直都是個麻煩
They've always been a problem.

271
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,820
整個英國到處都埋著他們的屍體
Bodies buried all over England.

272
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,930
巨人有一個古怪的特點
It's a curious feature of giants

273
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
他們偶爾會從墳墓中爬出來
that they occasionally rise from their graves

274
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,420
大肆破壞
and wreak havoc.

275
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,680
這種時候  我們就會組織一場狩獵
And when they do, we organize a hunt.

276
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,060
{\an8}歐洲民間神話  超自然的獵人在野外追逐獵物
通常預示著災難

277
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,060
-狂獵  -好名字
- The wild hunt. - Oh, catchy.

278
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,340
我還以為我的頭就夠大了
And I thought I had a big head.

279
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,280
顯然你們在這方面是老鳥了
Clearly, you guys are old pros at this.

280
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,690
為什麼還要我來幫你們殺一個巨人
Why do you need me to help you kill a giant?

281
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,200
實際上是三個
Three giants, actually.

282
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,440
一個  我們沒問題  甚至兩個也能對付
One, we can handle, perhaps even two.

283
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
但是三個加在一起  就是另外一回事了
But three, that's a different matter altogether.

284
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,620
這個特殊的三人組
This particular trio

285
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,750
威脅著新森林地區[英國南部]is terrorizing the New Forest.

286
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,630
吮吸那些不幸與之
Sucking on the bones of anyone

287
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,880
發生衝突的人的骨頭
unlucky enough to fall foul of them.

288
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,380
要知道  他們對骨髓欲罷不能
The marrow, you see. They can't get enough.

289
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,070
如果有巨人到達人口密集的地方
So, if any were to reach a population center...

290
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,370
那就好玩了
It's Miller time.

291
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,970
這不是輕而易舉的任務  地獄男爵
This is not a task to be taken lightly, Hellboy.

292
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,850
這些是巨人殭屍  非常難搞
These are Gigantum Mortis. Very unpleasant.

293
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,450
問你父親就知道了
Just ask your father.

294
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,710
崔沃也曾受邀加入狩獵
Trevor was a guest of the hunt,

295
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,230
我們在1943年合力幹掉了一個巨人
when we took one down in '43.

296
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,810
我早就知道我爸老得很慢  但是你們...
I always knew Dad aged well, but you guys...

297
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,200
照片就像是昨天拍的一樣
Picture looks like it was taken yesterday.

298
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,630
這是有原因的
There's a reason for that.

299
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,280
你剛才準確地觀察到的現象
The phenomenon you so rightly observed

300
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,460
源自於一場降神會
was the byproduct of a seance

301
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,800
我們四個人  還有你父親布魯姆教授
the four of us, along with your Professor Broom,

302
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,250
都參與了
were involved in

303
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,320
就在戰爭爆發前
just before the war.

304
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,430
請容我介紹我們的常駐先知
Allow me to introduce our resident seer,

305
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,360
伊麗莎白·哈頓夫人
Lady Elizabeth Hatton.

306
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,460
那天晚上我接觸到的靈魂
The spirit I made contact with that night

307
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,670
異常地強大
was exceptionally powerful.

308
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,410
它警告我們有東西即將出現
It warned us that something was coming.

309
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,090
可能會終結人類的東西
Something that would end mankind.

310
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,420
而我們被選中去尋找並摧毀它
And that we'd been chosen to seek it out and destroy it.

311
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,950
自那之後  我們以蝸牛的速度緩慢衰老
Ever since, we've aged at a snail's pace

312
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,940
就是為了完成那個使命
in order to fulfill that mission

313
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,650
無論要耗費多久
no matter how long it took.

314
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,260
好吧  你們擔心的這個東西
Okay. And this thing you're worried about,

315
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,010
它出現了嗎
did it show up?

316
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,560
是的
Oh, yes.

317
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,220
你出現了
You did.

318
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,170
你來到這個世界的那晚  我就在現場
I was there the night that you came into the world.

319
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,020
那時第二次世界大戰已接近尾聲
World War II was coming to an end.

320
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,660
德國幾乎被擊敗了
Germany was all but defeated.

321
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,360
但是納粹還藏了最後一手
But the Nazis still had one last trick up their sleeve.

322
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,130
他們求助於臭名昭著的
They turned to the infamous

323
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,790
死靈法師格裡戈裡·拉斯普京
necromancer Grigori Rasputin.

324
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,010
在蘇格蘭海岸外的一個小島上
On an island off the coast of Scotland,

325
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,980
他們聚在一起進行古老的神秘儀式
they gathered to invoke an ancient occult ritual...

326
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,900
想要把戰局扭轉成對德國有利的局面
intended to turn the tide of war back in Germany's favor.

327
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,570
但是出了差錯
But something went wrong.

328
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,770
儀式沒有完全按照他們的計劃進行
The ritual didn't turn out quite as they planned.

329
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,660
{\an2}殺了他

330
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,920
幸運的是
Fortunately,

331
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,930
傳奇納粹獵人  龍蝦隊長趕到了
legendary Nazi hunter the Lobster arrived...

332
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,220
你們好
Guten Tag!

333
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,550
帶領盟軍進行了大膽的突襲
leading the allies on a daring raid.

334
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,430
再見
Goodbye.

335
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,130
來吧  讓魔鬼知道是誰殺了你
Here, so the devil knows who sent you.

336
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,470
{\an2}{\pos(250,220)}去你的

337
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,330
至於你們這些踢正步的混蛋
As for the rest of you goose-stepping bastards,

338
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,640
小心我的熱能手套
beware of my claw

339
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,410
因為我是來將你們所有人
for I have come to inflict justice

340
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,530
繩之以法的
on all of you.

341
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,270
布魯姆教授和我
Professor Broom and myself

342
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,280
當時在和盟軍合作
were working with the allies at the time.

343
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,130
憑借他對神秘儀式的瞭解
With his knowledge of the occult

344
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,560
以及我預見未來的天賦
and my gift of foresight,

345
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,760
我們率領秘密任務到達島上
we led a secret mission to the island

346
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,590
準備殺死那晚從地獄深處召喚出來的
to kill whatever abomination was summoned

347
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,220
任何可憎之物
from the depths of hell that night.

348
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,980
等一下
Hold it!

349
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,230
接下來交給我
I'll take it from here.

350
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,490
但是我們發現了你
Instead, we found you.

351
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
你父親從沒跟你提起過  對嗎
Your father never told you, did he?

352
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,500
那晚他究竟為什麼在那裡
Why he was really there that night?

353
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,310
他一定是忘說了
Must've slipped his mind.

354
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,580
拉斯普京把你作為武器帶到了這個世界
Rasputin brought you in the world as a weapon.

355
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,260
懷著耐心和理解
With patience and understanding,

356
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,030
布魯姆把那件武器變成了行善的利器
Broom turned that weapon into a force for good.

357
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,800
"耐心和理解"
"Patience and understanding."

358
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,700
你確定我們說的是同一個人嗎
You sure we're talking about the same guy?

359
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,920
他在你身上看到了我們其他人看不到的東西
He saw something in you that the rest of us could not.

360
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,540
他把你當自己的兒子養大
And he raised you as his own son.

361
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,750
你應該休息一下  地獄男爵
You should get some rest, Hellboy.

362
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,150
黎明時集合狩獵
The hunt will assemble at dawn.

363
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,020
所以我不僅是惡魔之子  還是納粹
So I'm devil spawn and a Nazi.

364
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,300
好極了  多謝  爸
Great. Thanks, Dad.

365
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,420
{\an8}爸

366
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,250
拜託
Come on!

367
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,180
{\an8}聖賽巴斯蒂安修道院

368
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,720
{\an8}請尊重我們的靜默誓言

369
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,420
{\an8}這麼晚不會是訪客

370
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,390
{\an8}別開門

371
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,710
它在哪兒  修道士
Where is it, monk?

372
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,060
過來  你們這些混蛋
Come here, you fucking bastards!

373
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,210
過來  你們敢嗎
Come here! Have you got it?

374
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,620
我很好奇  尖叫算不算打破你們的靜默誓言
I wonder, does screaming break your vow of silence, brother?

375
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,900
你知道我在找什麼  它在哪兒
You know what I'm looking for. Where is it?

376
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,290
帶我去
Show me!

377
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,590
快點
Come on!

378
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,180
過來  修道士
Come here, monk!

379
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,930
我他媽討厭鐵
I fuckin' hate iron!

380
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,370
打開它  唸咒語
Open it. Speak the words.

381
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,170
你知道只有聖徒的言語
You know only the words from a man of God

382
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,210
才能打破這道封印
can break the seal.

383
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,710
快他媽打開
Fucking open it!

384
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,270
難道什麼事都得我自己做嗎
Have I gotta do everything meself?

385
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,560
蠢貨
Gobshite.

386
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,810
[咒語]

387
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,920
歡迎回來  陛下
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

388
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,700
怎麼  我們是去討糖果還是狩獵巨人
What, are we trick-or-treating or hunting giants?

389
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,070
這是傳統  向以前勇敢的獵人致敬
Tradition. To honor the brave huntsmen who've come before.

390
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,430
那這些長刺刀呢
And the pig stickers?

391
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,450
另一個傳統
Another tradition.

392
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,640
古往今來被巨人殺手所使用
Used by giant slayers throughout the ages.

393
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,760
當然也經過了現代技術的改造
With a few modern modifications, of course.

394
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,860
比電椅的威力強五倍
Five times as potent as an electric chair.

395
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,370
提醒你一下  這不足以殺死巨人  但是
Not enough to kill a giant, mind you. But, uh, still,

396
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,420
可以輕易制服那些生物  你想要一個嗎
quite handy in subduing the creatures. Would you care for one?

397
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,920
不用了  我有自己的傳統
It's all right, I got traditions of my own.

398
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,430
天哪  我不用戴帽子吧
Oh, God. I don't have to wear the hat, do I?

399
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,700
不用  我們很清楚
No. We're very well aware

400
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,120
你對頭上的角很牴觸
of your distaste for horns.

401
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,190
不過作為狩獵大師  戴上這件頭飾
It's my honor, as master of the hunt,

402
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,230
是我的榮幸
to wear the headdress.

403
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,980
最後是這個  暗影
And here we are. Long Shadow.

404
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,370
你們沒有吉普車或摩托車之類的嗎
Don't you have a jeep or a motorcycle or something?

405
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,290
那可不太公平  不是嗎
That wouldn't be very sporting now, would it?

406
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,850
他會安全帶你回來的
He'll bring you home safely.

407
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,510
事先聲明  這不是我的主意
For the record, this wasn't my idea.

408
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,550
和哈頓夫人預言的一樣  有三組蹤跡
Three sets of tracks. Just as Lady Hatton foretold.

409
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,350
我數到四具屍體  雖然是殘骸
I count four bodies. Parts of them, anyway.

410
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,620
-他們會回來的  -你為什麼這麼肯定
- They'll be back. - What makes you so sure?

411
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,480
巨人是不會留下食物的
Giants don't leave food behind.

412
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,320
蹤跡向北  朝河的方向去了
The tracks are heading north, toward the river.

413
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,410
我們要在這裡戰鬥
This is where we'll make our stand.

414
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,640
他們會從橋上過河
They'll use the bridge to cross.

415
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,700
我們可以在任意一邊的灌木叢中佔據位置
We can take up positions in the brush on either side.

416
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,440
嗯  看起來是個偷襲的絕佳地點
Yeah, seems like a perfect spot for an ambush.

417
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,990
我也這麼想
My thoughts exactly.

418
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,270
-我們上  -幹掉他
- Let's get him! - Take him!

419
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,790
快追
After him!

420
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,050
打倒他
Bring him down!

421
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,910
你真的覺得我們需要你的幫助
Did you really think we needed your help

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,450
才能去殺我們獵殺了幾個世紀的巨人嗎
to kill something we've been hunting for centuries?

423
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,310
我們決不允許魔鬼
We will never allow the devil

424
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,440
坐上英格蘭的王座
to sit on the throne of England.

425
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,260
那將引發世界末日
It would usher in the apocalypse.

426
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,100
我必須承認
I must confess

427
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,850
當哈頓夫人第一次告訴我
when Lady Hatton first told me

428
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,030
她對未來的預見和必須做的事的時候
about her vision and what needed to be done

429
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,060
我有些猶豫
I was hesitant.

430
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,210
布魯姆對你的潛力很有信心
Broom was so certain of your potential

431
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,720
並且你做了很多善事
and you have done so much good.

432
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,840
但是命運是變幻無常的野獸
But fate is a fickle beast.

433
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,780
而現在我必須做
And now I must do

434
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,500
你父親多年前就該做的事
what your father should have done those many years ago.

435
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,430
不
No.

436
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,170
你的頭顱將成為我們陳列室的一大亮點
If it's any consolation, your head will make

437
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,230
也許這能讓你略感安慰
a wonderful addition to our gallery.

438
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,820
吉爾
Jill!

439
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,620
你完蛋了
You are going down!

440
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,850
我以為是同一個腳趾
I thought it was the same toe.

441
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,870
你想像不到我殺了多少人才拿到這個
You have no idea how many I had to kill.

442
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,480
我很快就能讓你玩上"扭扭樂"
I'll have you playing Twister in no time.

443
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,980
抱歉  玩笑開得太早
Sorry, too soon.

444
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,550
你的努力很快就會得到回報
And soon you shall reap the reward for your efforts.

445
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,070
我不知道你會不會覺得餓
I didn't know if you'd be hungry or what, you know.

446
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,690
要是我在箱子裡待一千年  肯定餓瘋了
A thousand years in a box and I'd be starving.

447
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,780
你不會相信現在的人都會
You wouldn't believe what people

448
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,220
亂扔些什麼東西  餅乾
throw away these days. Cookie!

449
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,930
復仇是我唯一需要的食物
Revenge is the only sustenance I require.

450
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,200
看看這個
Look at this.

451
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,520
一個飽受戰爭和貧窮蹂躪的世界
A world ravaged by war and poverty

452
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,130
被無能的恐懼販子的領導著
led by feckless fear mongers.

453
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,150
他們用歌唱比賽取代了劍
They've replaced swords with singing competitions.

454
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,300
他們時日無多了
Well, not for much longer.

455
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,350
我的另一條手臂呢
What about my other hand?

456
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,810
你確定能找回來嗎
You're certain you can retrieve it?

457
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,230
當然  當然了
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,720
然後你會遵守承諾復原我
And you'll restore me, as you promised?

459
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,330
別擔心  你會得到應得的
Don't worry, you'll get what's due.

460
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,150
好事會降臨在耐心等待的人身上
All good things come to those who wait.

461
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,320
把最後一個箱子給我  讓我再次完整
Bring me the last box. Make me whole again.

462
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,360
然後我們將一起
And together,

463
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,250
用鮮血為這個世界洗禮
we will baptize this world in blood.

464
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,710
真疼  好了
That hurt. Okay.

465
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,710
看看這個
Well, look at that.

466
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,940
看來你們還是需要我的幫助的
I guess you did need my help after all.

467
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,190
等一下
Wait a minute.

468
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,530
我以為有三個巨人
I thought there was supposed to be three.

469
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,620
天哪  明天早上我肯定渾身酸痛
God, I'm gonna feel that in the morning.

470
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,940
到爸爸這兒來
Come to papa.

471
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,050
別動  帥哥
Hold still, handsome!

472
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,660
裡面真他媽濕
It's fucking wet in there!

473
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,890
哥們
Pal!

474
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,950
你都吃了什麼
What have you been eating?

475
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,610
該死  我忘了
Shit, I forgot.

476
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,420
只剩你和我了  公主
Yeah, it's just you and me now, princess!

477
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,430
是我的滴滴嗎
Is that my Uber?

478
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,190
他在那兒
There he is.

479
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,340
-就是他  -帶他上車
- That's him. - Let's get him.

480
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,830
歡迎回到人間
Welcome back to the land of the living.

481
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,910
幾乎沒留下傷痕  你癒合得真快
Hardly a scratch left. You heal fast.

482
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,650
我在哪兒
Where am I?

483
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,280
培根  雞蛋和血腸  吃嗎
Bacon, eggs and black pudding, do ya?

484
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,180
看起來你需要一頓像樣的英式早餐
You look like you could use a proper English breakfast.

485
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,460
來吧  在你倒下之前坐下
Go on, sit down before you fall down.

486
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,630
我是怎麼來的
How did I get here?

487
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,980
一個人和一輛車
A man with a van.

488
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,060
實際上是四個人
Actually, four men.

489
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,610
順便說一下  你欠我三百鎊
You owe me 300 quid, by the way.

490
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,200
不好意思  我認識你嗎
I'm sorry, do I know you?

491
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,490
"提防閃電巨龍  我的孩子"
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!"

492
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,490

"口能撕咬"
"The jaws that bite,"

494
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,810
"爪能扼殺"
"the claws that catch!"

495
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,620
-"提防啾啾怪鳥"  -"啾啾怪鳥"
- "Beware the Jubjub bird," - "The Jubjub bird..."

496

- "and shun the frumious..." - "The frumious..."

497
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,580
"兇惡猛獸"
"Bandersnatch!"

498
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,280
愛麗絲
Alice.

499
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,100
小愛麗絲·莫納漢

500
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,930
沒那麼小的愛麗絲·莫納漢
Not so little Alice Monaghan.

501
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,280
你現在是幹這個嗎  用茶葉占卜
This is what you do now, huh? You what, you read tea leaves?

502
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,570
給別人算命嗎
You, uh, you tell people's fortune?

503
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,610
我是在利用與生俱來的天賦
I make use of the gifts I was given.

504
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,200
是嗎  你幫人們和死去的親戚交流嗎
Oh, yeah? You let folks talk to their dead relatives?

505
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,700
怎麼收費  五塊錢一次嗎
For what, like five bucks a pop?

506
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,010
差不多十塊吧
More like a tenner.

507
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,960
少撕了一個
Missed one.

508
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,740
糟糕
Bollocks!

509
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,510
你得避開燒焦的部分吃了
You'll have to eat around the burnt bits.

510
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,220
而且算你走運
And lucky for you, too.

如果不是死者幫忙  我根本找不到你
If it weren't for the dead, I never would've found you.

513
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,360
他們一直絮絮叨叨  特別是媽媽和爸爸
They keep blathering on. Especially Mom and Dad.

514
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,600
對了  他們向你問好
They say hi, by the way.

515
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,960
{\an8}爸爸  媽媽

516
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,980
抱歉  我不知道
Sorry. I didn't know.

517
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,090
你怎麼可能知道呢
Why would you?

518
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,570
如果你有那麼一點點在乎
Maybe if you'd given a flying fig

519
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,580
在過去的二十年裡能聯繫我一次的話
and checked in on me once in the past 20...

520
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,730
什麼
What?

521
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,490
不  他沒有  我來處理就好
No, he doesn't. Just let me deal with it.

522
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,630
更多死者嗎
More dead people?

523
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,160
我跟你說過  他們從不閉嘴
I told you, they never shut up.

524
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,340
他們現在在跟你說什麼
What are they telling you now?

525
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,960
他們說我應該抓住機會殺了你
They're saying I should kill you while I have the chance.

526
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,110
你看  他們知道你不知道的事
You see, they know what you don't,

527
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,000
比如桌子下面有一把霰彈槍
that I've got a shotgun under the table

528
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,160
填裝了天使之骨的子彈
loaded with angel bones

529
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,270
正瞄準你的襠部
aimed right at your todger.

530
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,640
這年頭似乎大家都想要我的命
Seems like everybody wants me dead nowadays.

531
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,350
他們告訴你為什麼了嗎
They give you a reason?

532
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,830
只說了末日即將降臨
Only that the end is coming.

533
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,140
而且讓末日降臨的人是你
And it'll be you that brings it.

534
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,910
谷歌翻譯一下  可以嗎
Google-translate that, would you?

535
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,850
只是幾句...
It's just something that...

536
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,460
一個朋友告訴我的話
a friend told me, you know.

537
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,510
就像是預言
Like a prophecy.

538
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,770
{\an8}惡魔

539
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,290
你到底開不開槍
You gonna shoot me or what?

540
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,050
死者可能會害怕你這個惡魔
The dead might be afraid of your demon ass,

541
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,560
但我更瞭解你
but I know you better.

542
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,480
再說  我還欠你一個人情
Besides, I still owe you one

543
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,110
你在我小時候救過我的命
for saving my life when I was just a kid.

544
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,930
那我們到桌子底下幹什麼
So, what are we doing down here?

545
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,050
躲開玻璃
Avoiding the glass.

546
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,960
武裝警察
Armed police!

547
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,040
待在這兒
Stay here!

548
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,810
天啊
Jesus Christ!

549
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,420
我兒子真厲害
That's my boy.

550
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,710
爸
Dad!

551
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,380
你好  兒子
Hello, son.

552
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,300
我只是不明白你為什麼這麼生我的氣
I just don't know why you were so angry with me.

553
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,550
你就不能敲門嗎
You couldn't have knocked?

554
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,180
我告訴你了  我們清理完
Well, I told you, after we cleaned up

555
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,110
你和巨人戰鬥留下的一團糟
the mess you left behind with the giants

556
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,030
你又不在現場  我擔心你遭遇了不測
and you weren't there, I feared the worst.

557
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,390
謝天謝地你沒事  好嗎
Thank God you're all right. Okay?

558
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,710
你知道比背後挨刀更讓人受傷的是什麼嗎
You know what hurts worse than being stabbed in the back?

559
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,680
就是背後挨刀
Being stabbed in the back.

560
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,120
得了吧  你不能相信
Come on. You can't possibly believe

561
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,000
我早知道俄賽裡斯會社密謀要暗殺你
that I knew the Osiris Club was plotting to assassinate you.

562
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,560
你知道我不能相信什麼嗎
You know what I can't believe?

563
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,590
我不能相信你那麼多年前為了殺我
I can't believe you showed up on Nazi island

564
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,890
出現在納粹人的島上
all those years ago just to kill me.

565
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,610
是的  沒錯
Yeah, that's right,

566
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,340
我碰見了你的老情人  哈頓夫人
I bumped into your old flame, Lady Hatton.

567
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,410
她給我補充了一些
She, uh, filled me in on a couple of

568
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,010
我們的家庭故事中的遺漏之處
the missing pieces of our family narrative.

569
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,540
如果你想挖我的陳年舊事
Well, if you wanna dig up my sordid skeletons,

570
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,530
我會第一個坦誠相告
I'll be the first to hand you a shovel.

571
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,380
但現在不是時候
But this is not the time,

572
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,890
而且我想介紹你認識一個人  好嗎
and there's someone I wanna introduce you to, okay?

573
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,190
本·戴米奧少校  十一軍特種部隊隊長
Major Ben Daimio, head of Special Ops for M-11.

574
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,670
-十一軍  -這是我兒子
- M-11? - My son.

575
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,050
我以為你們在戰後就解散了
I thought you guys disbanded after the war.

576
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,150
我以為我們應該
And I thought we were supposed to be

577
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,920
打擊怪物  而不是與怪物共事
fighting monsters, not working with them.

578
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,070
你管誰叫怪物呢  哥們
Who you calling monster, pal?

579
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,680
你最近照鏡子了嗎  疤面煞星
You look in the mirror recently, Scarface?

580
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,170
-這是在玩幽默嗎  -也許吧
- Is that meant to be humor? - Maybe.

581
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,450
我的心理醫生確實說
My therapist does say that

582
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,820
我依靠笑話尋求正常化
I rely on jokes as a way to normalize.

583
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,120
正常化  是的  祝你好運
Normalize, right. Good luck with that.

584
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,870
很高興見到你們倆相處融洽
So glad to see you two are getting along.

585
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,760
因為是在英國領土  所以這是一次聯合行動
Since this is on British soil, it'll be a joint operation.

586
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,520
拜託  我不用任何幫助就能把俄賽裡斯會社
Please, I don't need any help kicking the dentures

587
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,210
打得滿地找牙好嗎  我能行
out of the Osiris Club, all right? I got this.

588
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,740
不  這比你瞭解的還要嚴重
No, this is bigger than you know.

589
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,130
聖賽巴斯蒂安修道院遭到襲擊
St. Sebastian's has been attacked

590
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,170
一件古物被盜
and a relic was stolen.

591
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,450
據稱是妮繆之棺的其中一具
Thought to be one of the Nimue Caskets.

592
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,420
妮什麼
Nim-who?

593
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,180
薇薇安·妮繆
Vivienne Nimue.

594
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,180
也被稱為血皇后
Also known as the Blood Queen.

595
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,610
公元五世紀的一位永生不死的女巫
An immortal fifth century sorceress.

596
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,240
她的其中一項能力就是
Amongst her powers, she has a plague

597
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,790
差點毀滅英國的瘟疫
that almost wiped Britain off the map.

598
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,490
而這一次可能毀滅全世界
And this time it could be the world.

599
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,020
亞瑟王親自收拾了那個怪物
King Arthur himself took care of that monster.

600
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,710
他用王者之劍肢解了她
He used Excalibur to dismember her,

601
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,680
然後把屍塊鎖在了棺材中
then locked the pieces in caskets

602
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,330
並將棺材藏在了全國的各個角落
and hid them throughout the country.

603
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,680
刮目相看  少校
Very impressive, Major.

604
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,830
俄賽裡斯會社在三十年代發現了其中一具
The Osiris Club discovered one in the '30s

605
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,610
把它作為他們的永久收藏
and kept it as part of their permanent collection.

606
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,550
好極了  那我們回俄賽裡斯會社
Great. So we go back to the Osiris Club,

607
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,700
找到這個棺材
we find this casket,

608
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,850
搞清楚到底是誰想把血皇后的碎屍
we figure out whoever's trying to Humpty Dumpty

609
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,220
重新拼起來
this Blood Queen back together

610
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,990
順便對會社進行報復
and we get a little payback while we're at it.

611
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,720
報復  這不是為了復仇
Payback? This isn't about revenge.

612
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,790
對我來說就是
For me, it is.

613
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,930
一旦棺材安全了
Once the casket is secure,

614
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,920
你就要乘第一班飛機離開
you'll be on the first flight out.

615
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,000
防禦局可以把你關回你的回籠子裡
The Bureau can put you back in your cage.

616
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,000
我的籠子  我的籠子
My cage? My cage!

617
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,080
我會特別要求你來打掃我的鋸角屑
I'm gonna ask specifically that you clean my sawdust.

618
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,230
等不及看你聞惡魔的屎了  哥們
Can't wait till you smell demon shit, pal!

619
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,840
他們告訴我你是負責人
They tell me you're the man in charge.

620
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,370
-這是什麼  -索賠你們造成的破壞
- What's this? - A bill for damages.

621
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,990
{\an8}破壞索賠
一百萬英鎊

622
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,670
一百萬英鎊  就為幾扇打破的窗戶
A million pounds? For a few broken windows?

623
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,730
你得考慮到造成的情感創傷
You've gotta factor in the emotional trauma.

624
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,930
不好意思  你是誰來著
I'm sorry, who are you again?

625
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,800
我是救了地獄男爵的女孩  你又是誰
I'm the girl who saved Hellboy. Who the hell are you?

626
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,260
是啊  對了  我想謝謝你救我
Yeah, I wanted to thank you for that, by the way.

627
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,520
所以她是你的保鏢嗎
So, she's what, your bodyguard?

628
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,880
說得沒錯  我們出發吧
Fucking right I am. So let's go.

629
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,730
這是軍事行動  不是狂歡節的助興節目
This is a military operation! Not a carnival sideshow.

630
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,390
愛麗絲是我唯一信任的人  好嗎
Alice is the only person that I trust, all right?

631
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,450
所以如果你想讓我去
So, you want me,

632
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,700
她就得跟著一起
she comes with.

633
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,740
給
Here.

634
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,240
你的新玩具
Your new toy.

635
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,500
做你該做的事
Do what you have to do.

636
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,920
我要回總部
I'm going back to HQ

637
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,950
想辦法定位血皇后的其餘屍塊
and try to locate the rest of the Blood Queen.

638
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,920
祝你們好運
Good luck, hmm?

639
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,870
教授  這女孩怎麼辦
Professor. What about the girl?

640
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,550
愛麗絲  她是個強大的靈媒
Alice? She's a powerful spirit medium.

641
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,940
帶上她一起  我們需要所有的幫手
Take her with you. We need all the help we can get.

642
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,320
好了  這裡完事了  我們出發
All right, we're done here! Let's move it out!

643
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,620
你不打算打開看看嗎
Well, aren't you gonna open it?

644
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,570
厲害了
That's mega.

645
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,040
他大概是在過度補償
He's probably overcompensating

646
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,760
因為他不是我親爸
'cause he's not my real dad.

647
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,470
這個禮物不得了
That's some present.

648
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,230
有些爸爸給孩子買樂高
Some dads get their kids LEGOs.

649
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,200
怎麼了
What's wrong?

650
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,510
怎麼了
What's wrong?

651
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,630
通靈偏頭痛
Psychic migraine.

652
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,620
就像是我大腦裡發生了車禍
It's like a car crash in my head.

653
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,640
這裡發生了可怕的事
Something terrible happened here.

654
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,660
待在這裡  不要動
Stay here. Don't move.

655
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,880
天啊
Oh, God.

656
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,620
-停  按我的指令行動  -什麼
- Hold. Move on my command. - What?

657
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,130
我們能進去了嗎
Can we go in now?

658
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,230
天啊  救救他  你們沒聽見他在尖叫嗎
For fuck's sake, help him! Can't you hear him screaming?

659
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,240
愛麗絲
Alice.

660
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,320
那是什麼聲音
What is that sound?

661
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,230
是哈頓夫人
It's Lady Hatton.

662
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,430
你之前告訴我們的那個靈媒
The psychic you were telling us about?

663
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,870
顯然  她這個靈媒不夠靈
Clearly, she wasn't psychic enough.

664
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,520
愛麗絲  有什麼感應嗎
Alice, picking up anything?

665
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,330
她的靈魂還在這裡
Her spirit's still with us.

666
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,250
你能和她交流嗎
You think you can make contact?

667
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,420
搞清楚這裡發生了什麼
Figure out what the hell happened here?

668
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,120
也許你應該離開  少校
You might wanna leave, Major.

669
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,140
這種事可算不上愉快
This kind of thing isn't pretty.

670
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,950
錯過所有的樂趣嗎  絕對不可能
And miss all the fun? Not a chance.

671
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,100
哈頓夫人  你能聽到我的聲音嗎
Lady Hatton, can you hear me?

672
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,190
哈頓夫人
Lady Hatton...

673
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,910
見鬼了
Well, I'll be fucked.

674
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,620
妮繆  她回來了
Nimue, she has returned.

675
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,830
嗯  這個我們知道
Yeah, we know that.

676
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,630
這就是俄賽裡斯會社想殺我的原因嗎
Is that why Osiris tried to kill me?

677
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,970
人類會墮入她的黑暗
Man will fall to her darkness.

678
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,230
黑暗的子民
Those who call the shadows home

679
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,690
將再度崛起
will rise again.

680
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,580
好吧
Okay.

681
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,170
我想要更具體更切實的預言
I'd appreciate a prophecy with smaller and more relatable stakes.

682
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,690
絕不能讓皇后找到國王
The Queen must never find a king!

683
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,880
當妮繆再次完整之時
When Nimue is whole again,

684
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,260
你真正的命運就將揭曉
then your true destiny will be revealed.

685
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,370
這是我所見到的  只有到那時...
This I have seen. Only then will...

686
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,050
只有到那時會怎樣
Only then will what?

687
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,020
你正說到精彩的部分
You're just getting to the good part!

688
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,320
它還在這裡
It's... It's still here!

689
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,980
-你還好嗎  -不好
- Are you all right? - No.

690
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,690
一個女人剛從我嘴裡鉆出來了
A lady just came out of my fucking mouth!

691
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,250
你陪著她
Stay with her.

692
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,810
操
Fuck!

693
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,050
我認識你
I know you.

694
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,410
那是條胳膊嗎
Is that an arm?

695
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,580
快他媽放開我
Fucking let me go!

696
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,190
噁心死了
That's disgusting!

697
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,320
你媽難道沒教過你
Didn't your mother ever tell you

698
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,150
不要跟死物打交道嗎
you shouldn't play with dead things!

699
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,310
皇后陛下  救救我  我還沒準備好
My Queen, help me! I'm not ready yet!

700
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,530
皇后陛下
My Queen!

701
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,490
真迷人
Fascinating.

702
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,860
我從沒見過像你這樣的生物
Never have I seen a creature quite like you.

703
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,620
妮繆
Nimue.

704
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,400
如此強大的力量  如此輝煌的潛力
Such power, such glorious potential.

705
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,720
我們沒有理由成為敵人
There is no reason for us to be enemies,

706
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,200
我們可以一起
when we can be

707
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,080
成就更多
so much more.

708
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,670
他們害怕我們  他們稱我們為怪物
They fear us. They call us monsters.

709
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,560
我們渴望著同一天
We yearn for the same day,

710
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,220
那一天我們不再被辱罵  而是被稱頌為英雄
when we are not reviled but lauded as heroes.

711
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,960
一粒粒種子
Seed by seed,

712
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,770
一棵棵樹木  一塊塊石頭
tree by tree, stone by stone,

713
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,840
我們將一起重新種植伊甸園
we'll replant Eden together.

714
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,740
接下來會發生什麼
What happens next,

715
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,850
只有命運才能決定
only the fates decide.

716
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,390
地獄男爵
Hellboy!

717
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,400
你他媽的混賬
You fucking prick!

718
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,820
沒打中  不是嗎
I missed, didn't I?

719
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,240
告訴我你抓住那個混蛋了
Tell me you got the bastard.

720
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,300
我們追了  那個該死的跑得太快了
We pursued. The damn thing was just too fast.

721
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,030
我們連它的真面目都沒看清
We didn't even get a proper look at it.

722
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,950
那個醜陋的豬臉賤貨
That ugly pig-faced son of a bitch.

723
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,580
但是你看到了  對不對
But you did, didn't you?

724
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,460
你知道這是怎麼回事
You know what's going on here,

725
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,230
所以我強烈建議你現在就交待
so I strongly suggest you start talking.

726
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,850
是棕精靈
It was the Gruagach.

727
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,150
-什麼  -你確定嗎
- The what? - Are you sure?

728
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,700
嗯  我絕不會忘記那麼一張臉
Yeah. I'd never forget a face like that.

729
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,190
棕精靈是什麼
What's a Gruagach?

730
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,120
我們多年前曾經有一面之緣
We first crossed paths years ago.

731
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,780
愛麗絲當時還是個嬰兒
Alice was just a baby at the time,

732
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,640
而精靈喜歡偷嬰兒
and fairies loved to steal babies.

733
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,780
我們簡直像是活在一個
It's like living in a nightmare

734
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,090
永遠醒不來的噩夢裡
we can't wake up from.

735
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,960
天知道為什麼
Who knows why,

736
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,700
但是當他們設法偷到一個孩子後
but when they do manage to get their hands on one,

737
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,410
他們會留下一個換生靈來冒充人類
they leave a changeling in its place to pass for human.

738
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,910
她看上去是一樣的  但是
She looks the same, but...

739
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,310
我解釋不了
I can't explain it.

740
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,090
這不是我的女兒
That's not my daughter.

741
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,120
看看你
Look at you.

742
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,300
愛麗絲  你真是最可愛的小寶貝
Alice, aren't you the cutest little baby?

743
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,050
你的媽媽和爸爸...
Your mom and your dad are, uh,

744
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,560
擔心你最近舉止有點奇怪
well, worried that you've been acting strange.

745
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,840
沒關係  地獄男爵叔叔來了
It's okay. Uncle Hellboy is here.

746
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,450
他正好有個絕招
And he's got just the thing for that.

747
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,980
嗯  我也是這麼想的  你這個小混蛋
Yeah, that's what I thought, you little bastard!

748
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,630
天哪  你在做什麼
Jesus! What are you doing?

749
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,570
鐵  他們討厭鐵
Iron. They hate the stuff.

750
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,090
放開我
Let me go!

751
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,460
放開我  這是虐待兒童
Let me go! Ahh! This is child abuse!

752
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,050
我是個小寶寶  你這大個子混賬
I'm a little baby, you big fuck!

753
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,340
真噁心  那是什麼
It's disgusting! What is that thing?

754
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,330
抓不到
Didn't get!

755
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,750
滾開
Fuck off!

756
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,870
疼  疼  我保證  我保證
It hurts! It hurts! I promise! I promise!

757
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,290
精靈會把她送回來的
The fairies will return her!

758
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,830
我發誓  快他媽放開我
I swear! Just fucking let me go!

759
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,910
我也想相信你的話
Yeah, I'd love to take your word for it.

760
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,240
但你知道嗎
But you know what?

761
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,320
有個問題  那就是我不傻
There's one problem, I'm just not stupid!

762
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,210
傻逼
Twat!

763
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,470
你這個狡詐的小混蛋
You slippery little bastard!

764
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,140
聽著
Listen!

765
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,650
你最好趕緊把他們的孩子送回來
You better bring these people back their baby

766
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,680
否則我就親自去接她
or I'm coming to get her myself!

767
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,850
然後你和你的精靈小夥伴
And then you and your fairy friends

768
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,490
就有得後悔了
are gonna be sorry!

769
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,920
{\an8}愛麗絲鏡中世界奇遇記
劉易斯·卡羅爾

770
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,210
總算來了
About goddamn time.

771
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,390
愛麗絲
Alice!

772
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,080
天哪  她回來了
Oh, my God. She's back.

773
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,310
最好是新換的尿布
This better be a clean diaper,

774
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,140
否則我會去找你的
or I'm coming after you!

775
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,950
小愛麗絲
Wee Alice.

776
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,970
我不可能永遠躲著他
Guess I couldn't avoid him forever.

777
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,310
命運總是有辦法
Destiny always has a way

778
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,930
讓事情回到原點
of bringing things full circle.

779
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,280
命運
Destiny.

780
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,320
只不過是"巧合"的愚蠢解釋
Stupid word for "coincidence."

781
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,810
別說命運的壞話  她是個有仇必報的賤人
Don't talk shit about fate. She's a vindictive bitch.

782
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,710
我們背負著我們血統中的每一個罪惡
We carry every sin committed in our bloodlines.

783
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,430
血皇后也是這麼說的
Blood Queen said pretty much the same thing.

784
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,550
這一切是為了什麼
So, that's what this is all about?

785
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,220
你之前惹過什麼精靈之類的蠢貨
Some fairy tale wanker you pissed off

786
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,720
要來找你尋仇了
is now looking for revenge?

787
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,700
而且他正在利用血皇后來達成目的
And he's now using the Blood Queen to get it.

788
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,440
我說不好  或許是她在利用他
I don't know about that. Maybe she's using him.

789
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,440
怎麼說
And how's that?

790
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,710
那個叫亞瑟的
This Arthur comes along,

791
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,290
把她砍碎了
chops her up into little pieces,

792
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,820
裝在箱子裡埋了
buries her in boxes?

793
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,730
也許她只是想讓怪物們走出陰影
Maybe she just wants monsters to come out

794
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,660
重新生活呢
from the shadows and live again.

795
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,530
棒極了  這樣她就又有滅絕人類的機會了
Great, so she gets another shot at wiping out mankind.

796
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,510
我們不瞭解她  至少不確定
We don't know that about her. Not for sure.

797
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,770
集合我們的人  我要帶他們回倫敦總部
Collect our men. I'm taking them back to London HQ.

798
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:26,320
夜晚  秘密的忠實守護者
O night, faithful preserver of mysteries.

799
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,420
還有明亮的星辰與月亮
And ye bright stars and moon.

800
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,350
繼承了仇恨之日的火焰
Succeed the fires of hateful day.

801
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,690
小心點  你們這些渣滓
Careful, you slags!

802
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,490
比起1500年來
The pain is fleeting

803
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,700
被囚於箱子的折磨  這痛苦不算什麼
compared to 1,500 years locked in a box.

804
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,170
我活著只是為了服侍您  皇后陛下
I only live to serve, my Queen.

805
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,020
你服侍我的唯一目的就是
You only serve to get your revenge

806
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,660
向地獄男爵復仇
against this Hellboy.

807
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,290
他對你來說為何如此重要
Why is he so important to you?

808
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,260
他用鐵烙傷我
He burnt me with iron

809
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,730
詛咒我永世蒙受恥辱
and cursed me to a world of shame.

810
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,510
我本來可以做個人的
I could've been a person.

811
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,120
而不是這種可悲徘徊的東西
Not this wasted, wandering thing.

812
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,870
我本來可以享受真正的生活
I could've had a real life,

813
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,250
充滿了光明和幸福
filled with light and happiness.

814
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,680
地獄男爵剝奪了這個權力
Hellboy stole that from me.

815
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,750
可憐的東西
Poor creature.

816
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,400
復仇的慾望令我們被憤怒蒙蔽了雙眼
Lust for vengeance has made us both blind with rage.

817
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,720
妮繆  女巫皇后
Nimue, Queen of Witches.

818
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,430
妮繆還活著
Nimue who lives.

819
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,560
妮繆永生不死
Nimue, who can never die.

820
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,700
但現在
But now,

821
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,360
我看到面前出現了一條新的道路
I see a new path laid out before me,

822
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,530
一條通向更大榮耀的道路
one that would lead to far greater glory.

823
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:01,610
-你的地獄男爵是關鍵  -地獄男爵  但是...
- And your Hellboy is the key. - Hellboy? But...

824
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,890
我們這是要做什麼  我不明白
Where are we going with this? I don't... I don't understand.

825
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,080
你會明白的
You will.

826
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,640
但首先
But first,

827
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,620
我們必須完成一個最終任務
we must complete one final task.

828
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,410
-炸魚薯條店  -我們到了
- Fish 'n chips shop? - We're here.

829
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,660
{\an8}鱈魚衝擊
炸魚薯條

830
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,640
就是這裡嗎
This is it?

831
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,060
你指望會有個標誌寫著"秘密總部"嗎
Were you expecting a sign that says "Secret Headquarters"?

832
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,190
來吧
Come on.

833
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,940
哈剋夫人
Mrs. Harker.

834
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,840
你好
Hello.

835
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,910
我還以為外面就夠難聞了呢
I thought it smelled bad on the outside.

836
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,130
接下來交給你們兩個吧  我要走了
I'll let you two take it from here. I'm leaving.

837
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,120
而你  哪也不許去
And you, don't go anywhere.

838
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,130
我最不需要的就是一個怪人
Last thing I need is some freak

839
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,300
在附近閑晃嚇到當地人
wandering around scaring the locals.

840
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,600
他要去哪兒
Where's he going?

841
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,680
我們不是要拯救世界嗎
Haven't we got to be saving the world or something?

842
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:58,890
他是個混蛋
He's an asshole.

843
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,830
喂
Oi.

844
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,670
我要看證件  親愛的
I need some ID, love.

845
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,080
你認真的嗎
Are you serious?

846
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,160
恐怕規矩就是規矩
Rules are rules, I'm afraid.

847
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,430
現在煉獄和地獄我都去過了
Now I've been to purgatory and hell.

848
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,650
這是個老防空洞
It was an old bomb shelter

849
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,540
戰後重新翻修的
that was refurbished after the war.

850
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,830
翻修  你管這個叫翻修嗎
Refurbished? You call this refurbished?

851
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,410
太好了  你來了
Good, you're here!

852
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,960
這是我們目前掌握的有關妮繆的信息
This is all we got on Nimue so far.

853
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,210
我們沒事  感謝你的關心
We're fine. Thank you for asking.

854
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,250
你在俄賽裡斯會社的朋友可就不太好了
Your friends at Osiris, not so much.

855
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,740
每個故事都不一樣
No two stories are alike,

856
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,570
但一切似乎都表明
but everything seems to suggest

857
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,240
除非她完全復原
she won't get her full powers

858
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,610
否則她無法獲得全部的力量
until she's completely restored.

859
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:47,520
你聽見了嗎  你的朋友都死了
Did you hear me? All your friends are dead!

860
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,000
如果我們不找到她
And there'll be a lot more dead

861
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,610
還會有更多人死去
if we don't find her.

862
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,320
所以或許你們倆可以看看書
So perhaps you two would like to grab a book,

863
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,410
做點研究
do some research,

864
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,560
想辦法找出她在哪裡
maybe find out where she is,

865
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,870
這樣我們就能在她滅了我們之前滅了她
so we can bury her before she buries us.

866
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,010
真好  有作業
Great. Homework.

867
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,450
怪不得戴米奧溜了
No wonder Daimio took off.

868
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,790
{\an8}槍炮匠

869
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,910
戴米奧探員  十一軍  貨備好了嗎
Agent Daimio, M-11. Is the package ready?

870
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,410
快好了  長官
Sir, almost.

871
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,880
你確定這能管用嗎
You're sure this is going to work?

872
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,740
已經有很多人試過殺他了
A lot of people have tried to kill him already.

873
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,680
他們沒用過這樣的東西
Not with something like this they didn't.

874
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,690
這是用猶大的銀幣
It's cast from Judas Silver

875
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,420
混合聖多米尼克的血
mixed with the blood of Saint Dominic,

876
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,530
並受過聖父祝福的武器
blessed by the Holy Father himself.

877
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,440
我向你保證  一定管用
It will work, I assure you.

878
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,610
假設你真的用得上
Assuming you've actually got to use it.

879
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,470
我是說  誰能說這傢伙不誠實呢
I mean, who's to say this bloke's not on the level?

880
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,290
你知道我當兵前是做什麼的嗎
Do you know what I did before joining the service?

881
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,820
保險精算師
I was an actuary.

882
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,150
我根據一系列
I assessed risk

883
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,930
複雜的數學方程式來評估風險
based on a series of complex mathematical equations.

884
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,210
你看  人會說謊  但數字不會
You see, people lie, but numbers don't.

885
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,130
在我看來  地獄男爵有所隱瞞
And from where I stand, Hellboy doesn't add up.

886
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,460
他體內的怪物是無法否認的
The monster inside him cannot be denied.

887
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,860
不是針對個人  只是數學而已
It's not personal, it's just maths.

888
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,790
所以沒錯  不能讓他活下去
So, yeah, can't see letting him live.

889
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,150
確保一擊致命  要麼心臟要麼大腦
Make sure it's a kill shot. Either the heart or the brain.

890
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,690
那就心臟吧
The heart it is.

891
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,030
地獄男爵的大腦太小難以瞄準
Hellboy's brain is too small a target.

892
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,790
這本書上怎麼這麼多字
Why does this book have so many words?

893
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,260
假設我們找到妮繆了  假設找到她了
Let's say we find Nimue, huh? Let's say we find her.

894
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,700
然後呢
Then what?

895
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,040
你要用正義的憤怒和強力的拳頭
Well, with a righteous fury and a mighty fist,

896
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,620
將她打倒
you'll smite her down.

897
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,960
好了  拜託  地獄男爵
Now, come on, Hellboy,

898
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,370
把你的腳從丘吉爾的桌子上拿下來  好嗎
take your feet off Churchill's desk, will you?

899
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,100
{\an8}溫斯頓·丘吉爾爵士

900
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,000
牛逼
Wicked.

901
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,060
然後呢
Then what?

902
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,770
然後確保她死透  不會捲土重來
Then we make sure she doesn't come back for the sequel.

903
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,100
然後呢
Then what?

904
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,450
然後世界會照常運轉
Then the world will keep on spinning

905
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,130
我們就可以再喝杯茶了
and we'll have another cup of tea.

906
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,680
然後...
And then...

907
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,370
呢
what?

908
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,360
你到底在說什麼
What are you on about?

909
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,820
回答問題就行了
Just answer the question.

910
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,180
然後呢
And then what?

911
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,910
我們去找下一個敵人  這是我們的工作
Well, we fight our next foe. It's what we do.

912
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,810
-然後呢  -各位
- And then what? - Guys.

913
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,560
然後...呢
And then... what?

914
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,060
你有話要說  就說出來
You have something to say, say it.

915
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,310
你的道德高地是建立在一堆狗屎上的
Your moral high ground is founded on a pile of bullshit.

916
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,560
這裡是超自然調查防禦局
This is the B.P.R.D.

917
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,010
我們是沙子上的線[底線]We're the line in the sand.

918
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,780
沙子就是這樣的
That's the thing about sand,

919
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,260
你可以再畫一條線
you can always draw another line.

920
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,560
-各位  -要不是有我們
- Guys! - If we weren't here,

921
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,070
這裡早就變成撒旦的度假屋了
this would be Satan's holiday home.

922
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:28,260
要是人類不那麼熱衷於
You know, maybe if humans weren't so keen

923
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,820
殺女巫和惡魔之類的
on killing witches and demons and such,

924
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,210
女巫和魔鬼之類的
the witches and demons and such

925
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:35,350
就不會那麼熱衷於殺人類
wouldn't be so keen on killing humans.

926
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,200
這是胡攪蠻纏  你心知肚明
That's a false equivalence and you know it.

927
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,020
肯定還有別的辦法
There's gotta be another way.

928
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,030
我們面臨的每一個威脅的答案
The answer to every threat we face

929
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,990
不可能是消滅
cannot be annihilation.

930
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,490
肯定存在一個怪物
There's gotta be a world where monsters

931
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,300
不用躲在陰影裡的世界
don't have to hide in the shadows,

932
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:50,940
他們不必生活在恐懼之中  怪物可以...
where they don't have to live in fear. Where monsters...

933
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,680
她影響到你了嗎  妮繆
Has she got to you? Nimue,

934
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,210
她用花言巧語和挺拔的胸部
she got to you with her perfumed words

935
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,410
打動你了嗎
and her perky breasts?

936
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,240
太蠢了
So stupid!

937
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,740
我不是在說她
I'm not even talking about her!

938
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,020
那你是在說誰
Then who?

939
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,300
我們面臨世上所有的神秘和超自然威脅
We face every mystical and metaphysical threat there is,

940
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,690
但你還是收養了我  為什麼
and yet you take me in. Why?

941
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,140
你是被派去殺我的
You were sent to kill me.

942
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,870
是什麼改變了你的想法
What changed your mind?

943
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,320
你
You did.

944
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,770
十歲生日你送了我一把槍
You gave me a gun on my tenth birthday!

945
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,500
你派我去威爾頓根森林
You sent me into the Wildungen forest

946
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:27,350
狩獵一群野山巨怪
to hunt a pack of wild hill trolls!

947
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,870
又來了
Here we go again.

948
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:32,560
對  我們沒玩過蛇梯棋
No, we didn't play Snakes and Ladders.

949
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,040
我們沒玩過釣魚遊戲
We didn't play Go Fish.

950
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,910
我沒教過你踢足球或打棒球
I didn't coach you in football or baseball.

951
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:38,820
你把我變成了該死的武器
You made me a goddamn weapon.

952
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:42,930
我只是想幫助你成為最好的你
I just wanted to help you become the best you.

953
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,770
如果你真的愛我
If you, uh, loved me,

954
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,010
也許你早該和你那些想置我於死地的
maybe you could talk to some of your human friends

955
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,910
人類朋友談談
that would want to see me dead,

956
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,280
而不是讓我去
rather than unleashing me

957
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,720
屠殺我的兄弟姐妹
to slaughter my brothers and sisters!

958
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,750
幹嘛
What?

959
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,000
教養有方
Just solid parenting.

960
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,050
該死的人類
Goddamn humans.

961
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,400
上樓
Going up.

962
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,060
下樓
Going down.

963
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,420
我按的上樓
I pushed up!

964
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,040
下樓
Going down.

965
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,260
-上樓  -下樓
- Up! - Going down.

966
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,500
搞什麼
What the fuck?

967
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,020
-上樓  上樓  上樓  -下樓  下樓  下樓
- Up! Up! Up! Up! - Down. Down. Down. Down.

968
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,280
下樓  下樓  下樓
Down. Down. Down.

969
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,010
下樓
Going down.

970
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,660
地下一層
Lower ground.

971
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,160
雅佳婆婆
Baba Yaga.

972
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,310
婆婆  雅佳婆婆
Baba? Baba Yaga!

973
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,300
省省吧
Cut the crap.

974
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,620
我知道你在
I know you're here.

975
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,180
你為什麼召喚我
Why'd you summon me?

976
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,760
你想玩遊戲是吧
You wanna play games, huh?

977
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,440
這樣吧  我們來玩骰子遊戲
Tell you what, let's break out the Yahtzee.

978
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,350
其它的我不感興趣
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

979
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,730
我感受到了你的飢餓
I felt your hunger,

980
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:03,740
我為你準備了盛宴
and I have prepared a feast for you.

981
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,060
你可真漂亮
Don't you look lovely.

982
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:48,890
大多數人認為我醜陋無比  獨眼的老巫婆
Most think me grotesque. An old hag with one eye.

983
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,680
不  我不這麼認為
No, not me.

984
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,430
因為是你讓我變成這樣的
Probably because you did this to me!

985
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,460
我記得你試圖把斯大林的
I recall you trying to raise

986
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,850
鬼魂從墓地裡召喚出來
Stalin's ghost from the Necropolis.

987
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:05,130
我總得做點什麼來阻止你
I had to do something to stop you.

988
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,720
所以你打瞎我的眼睛
So you shot out my eye

989
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,440
把我關進這個監獄
and put me in this prison.

990
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:17,660
我覺得把你放逐到鄰近的空間
You know, I thought that banishing you to an adjacent dimension was,

991
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,780
挺聰明的
kinda clever.

992
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:25,120
過來  坐下
Come. Sit.

993
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,190
吃吧
Eat.

994
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,690
對兩個人來說  真是桌宴席
Yeah. Quite a spread for just two people.

995
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,950
我們慶祝她的歸來
We celebrate her return.

996
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,300
妮繆
Nimue?

997
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,290
你為她的正義喝彩是正確的
You are correct to applaud her righteousness.

998
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,840
在她的世界裡  你會被奉為英雄
In her world, you will be hailed a hero!

999
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:53,760
他們會為你建造兩千英尺高的雕像
They will build statues of you, 2,000 feet high!

1000
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,770
用你敵人的骨頭打造而成
Made from the bones of your enemies.

1001
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,910
那需要一大堆骨頭
That'd take a shit-ton of bones.

1002
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,920
晚餐吃什麼
What is for dinner?

1003
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,890
這是個小孩嗎
Is that a child?

1004
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:16,930
人類的小孩而已
It's just a human child.

1005
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:39,040
吃吧
Eat.

1006
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,800
天哪
Oh, God!

1007
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,620
笨手笨腳  不好意思  我得走了
So clumsy. Sorry about that. I gotta go.

1008
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,640
得去復活現場
Gotta be there for that resurrection.

1009
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,980
肯定比披頭士還帶勁
Gonna be better than The Beatles!

1010
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,610
我可以幫你
I can help you.

1011
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,880
你可以  不是嗎
You can, can't you?

1012
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,570
你知道妮繆在哪兒  不是嗎
You know where Nimue is, don't you?

1013
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,620
多漂亮的眼睛
Such nice eyes.

1014
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,100
跟尿一樣黃
Yellow as piss.

1015
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,380
我最愛的顏色
My favorite color.

1016
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,610
我想要一個來代替你從我這奪走的眼睛
I want one to replace what you took from me.

1017
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,140
那是不可能的  姐妹
That's not gonna happen, sister.

1018
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,720
你的時間不多了  惡魔
Your time is running out, demon.

1019
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,680
一旦妮繆完成復活
Once Nimue's resurrection is complete,

1020
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,740
她的瘟疫會剝去人們身體上的肉
her plague will strip the flesh from bodies.

1021
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,240
好吧  行  給你
All right, fine, take it.

1022
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,890
先告訴我去哪找妮繆
Just tell me where to find Nimue first.

1023
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:37,150
這是一項神聖的交易
This is a sacred bargain.

1024
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,550
一旦達成  就不能打破
Once made, it cannot be broken.

1025
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,500
怎麼  你想要書面的嗎
What, do you want it in writing?

1026
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,350
不需要
No need.

1027
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,360
我們用吻達成交易
Let's seal it with a kiss.

1028
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,010
你的舌頭上怎麼有毛
How do you have hair on your tongue?

1029
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,200
去彭德爾山
Go to Pendle Hill.

1030
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,620
她需要回收她的血液
She will need to reclaim her blood

1031
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,470
才能恢復她的力量
in order to restore her power.

1032
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:12,550
你必須在午夜前趕到
You only have until midnight.

1033
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,510
哪一隻好呢  右眼
Which shall it be, the right

1034
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,230
還是左眼
or the left?

1035
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,960
好了  這會非常疼
Now, this will hurt a lot.

1036
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,790
-你發過誓的  -你會得到你的眼睛
- You swore! - You'll get your eye.

1037
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,130
等我用完就給你
Soon as I'm done with it.

1038
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,710
我們沒明確時間範圍
We never specified a time frame.

1039
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,930
應該說得更具體些的
Should've been more specific.

1040
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,330
你一直在吃小孩
You've been eating children!

1041
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,530
[咒語]

1042
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,900
滾  帶走你的眼睛
Go! Take your eyes

1043
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,190
繼續用一段時間
and have them for a while.

1044
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,090
但是你騙我  我要詛咒你
But cheat me and here's my curse,

1045
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,930
你有兩隻眼睛
that you have two eyes

1046
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,130
用來看你在這世上最愛的東西
to see the thing you love most in the world

1047
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,790
痛苦地死去
suffer and die!

1048
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,650
你是不打算用門了嗎
So, are you just not using doors anymore?

1049
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:36,940
別吊我們胃口
Don't keep us in suspense.

1050
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,150
我剛剛去見雅佳婆婆了
I just had a visit from Baba Yaga.

1051
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:43,770
血皇后在彭德爾山
The Blood Queen's in Pendle Hill.

1052
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,170
我們時間緊迫
We're on a clock!

1053
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,340
很高興看到你理順了輕重緩急
Glad to see you've straightened your priorities out.

1054
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,380
我不聽你的命令  老頭
I'm not taking orders from you, old man!

1055
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:01,090
我只是在沙子上畫我自己的線
I'm just drawing my own line in the sand!

1056
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,430
誰來幫我拿個薄荷糖
Somebody, please, get me a mint!

1057
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,760
好久不見  老朋友
It has been a long time, old friend.

1058
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,940
太變態了
This is sick.

1059
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,130
你知道他們在彭德爾山對那些女巫做了什麼嗎
Do you know what they did to the witches at Pendle Hill?

1060
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:41,080
他們割掉她們的舌頭  拿去餵蛆
They cut off their tongues, fed them to maggots

1061
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,810
然後當場把她們活埋了
and buried them alive right there on the spot.

1062
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:50,220
不要相信你在網上看到的一切
Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

1063
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,730
我說錯什麼了嗎
What did I say?

1064
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,780
清除世界上的邪惡是臟活
Ridding the world of evil is a dirty business.

1065
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,150
你和怪物到底有什麼淵源
What's with you and monsters, anyway?

1066
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,130
小時候有怪物非禮過你嗎
One of them touch you funny as a kid?

1067
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,970
我這輩子見過太多變態的事情了
I've been seeing freaky shit my whole life,

1068
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,740
如果說教會了我什麼的話
and if it's taught me anything,

1069
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,110
那就是仇恨隱藏在最正直的面孔之後
it's that hate hides behind the most righteous faces.

1070
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:12,240
你真的要跟我講面孔的事情嗎
Are you seriously gonna lecture me about faces?

1071
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,100
也許你認為這些傷疤是我刮鬍子弄出來的
Maybe you think I got these scars from shaving.

1072
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,060
發生了什麼  我會一直問下去的
What happened? I'm not gonna stop asking.

1073
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,580
還不如直接告訴我
You might as well tell me.

1074
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,490
那時我的部隊在伯利茲進行訓練演習
My unit was on a training exercise in Belize.

1075
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:33,960
當地的一個部落長老來找我們求助
One of the local tribal elders came to us asking for help.

1076
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,430
他們的村莊遭到一個食人獸的襲擊
Their village was under attack by a man-eater.

1077
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:41,980
它會在晚上出現  抓走它的獵物
It would come at night, carry off its prey.

1078
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:46,650
主要是男人  但有時是婦女和兒童
Mostly men, but sometimes it was women and children, too.

1079
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,950
野蠻  聰明
Savage. Smart.

1080
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,820
毫無悔意
Totally without remorse.

1081
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,780
在我們狩獵它的過程中
All the while that we were hunting it,

1082
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,100
實際上是它在狩獵我們
in reality, it was hunting us.

1083
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,310
我是唯一的倖存者
I was the only survivor.

1084
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,820
我很遺憾
I'm so sorry.

1085
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,180
我們接近目標了
We're coming up on target.

1086
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,200
我們不可能在那座山上著陸
There's no way we can land on that hill.

1087
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,080
我會盡可能靠近
I'll get us up as close as I can.

1088
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,320
皇后  給您
Here you go, Queen.

1089
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,960
您很快就會恢復成原來的自己
You'll be back to feeling your amazing old self in no time.

1090
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,850
我的生命之血支撐著你
My life blood sustains you...

1091
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:43,810
但現在我必須取回屬於我的東西
But now I must reclaim what is mine.

1092
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,470
其他人馬上就到了
The others will be here soon.

1093
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,550
那地獄男爵呢
What about Hellboy?

1094
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:54,460
如果他來了  我準備了一個小驚喜
If he comes, I have a little surprise in store.

1095
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,960
快點  快到午夜了
Come on, it's almost midnight!

1096
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,210
時間不多了
Time's running out.

1097
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,620
等等  等一下
Wait! Wait! Just wait!

1098
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,540
我不是惡魔也不是士兵  我他媽累死了
I'm not a demon or a soldier. I'm fucking knackered.

1099
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:11,200
-稍微休息一下  -好吧
- Just give us a sec. - All right.

1100
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,020
我來幫你...
Let me give you...

1101
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,700
一把
a hand!

1102
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,770
這個國家的死人就不能老實待在地下嗎
Won't anything in this country stay buried!

1103
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:33,710
現在不行
Not now!

1104
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:17,130
地獄男爵  快到午夜了
Hellboy! It's almost midnight.

1105
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,020
去找血皇后  這裡交給我們
Go find the Blood Queen. We can handle this.

1106
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,860
如果你不阻止她  她就會釋放瘟疫
She'll spread her plague if you don't stop her!

1107
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,380
沒時間了  快去
There's no time! Go!

1108
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,420
愛麗絲  我不會離開你的
Alice, I'm not leaving you.

1109
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,930
快去  阻止妮繆
Go! Stop Nimue!

1110
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,350
我沒子彈了  躲在我身後
I'm out. Stay behind me!

1111
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,390
我他媽還能去哪兒
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?

1112
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,990
好球
Goal!

1113
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,500
[咒語]

1114
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,020
終於
At last...

1115
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,960
我重生了
I am reborn.

1116
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,730
是的  您氣色不錯  陛下
Yeah, you're looking good, Your Majesty.

1117
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,870
她是城堡的皇后
She's the queen of the castle.

1118
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:00,200
他們來了  皇后陛下
They're here, my Queen.

1119
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,910
他們從黑暗中出來
They've come from out of the darkness

1120
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,140
慶祝您的回歸
to celebrate your return.

1121
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,670
不用再點頭哈腰了  我親愛的子民
No more bowing and scraping, my beloveds.

1122
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,670
那不是我想要的
That is not what I want.

1123
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,180
我想要一支大軍
I want an army,

1124
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,930
長期隱藏於人類的視線之外
long hidden from the eyes of man.

1125
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,790
我想要被遺忘的人走出黑暗
I want the forgotten people out of the dark!

1126
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:41,030
那些生活在塵土中的人
Those who have lived in dust,

1127
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:45,150
那些啃食干骨頭  夢見鮮血的人
who have gnawed on dry bones while dreaming of blood!

1128
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,070
那就是我想要的  給我一支這樣的軍隊
That is what I want. Give me an army like that

1129
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:52,370
我們會讓白天的世界哭泣
and we will make the daytime world weep!

1130
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,350
不要像老鼠一樣蜷縮在那裡
Well, don't just cower there like mice.

1131
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,910
上前來
Step forth.

1132
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,480
親愛的姐妹們
Dear sisters.

1133
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,860
你們真好  藏了那麼多年
How kind of you to grace me with your presence

1134
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,250
現在過來捧場
after hiding all these years.

1135
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:18,570
求求您  妮繆  仁慈對待我和姐妹們
Please, Nimue, for me and my sisters, have mercy.

1136
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,270
戈內達  你對我仁慈過嗎
Ganeida, did you show me mercy?

1137
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,570
當亞瑟把我砍碎
When Arthur cut me to pieces

1138
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,440
活埋我的時候
and buried me alive,

1139
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,450
你的仁慈在哪裡
where was your mercy then?

1140
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,140
-不要  求求您  -看看你
- Don't, I beg you! - Look at you.

1141
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,500
像動物一樣卑躬屈膝
Groveling like an animal.

1142
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,650
別擔心  戈內達  我不會殺你的
Don't worry, Ganeida, I won't kill you.

1143
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,630
但你必須先為我做件事
But you must do something for me first

1144
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:54,310
來證明你新發現的忠誠
to prove your newfound loyalty.

1145
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,530
帶地獄男爵去見那個能指引他命運的人
Take Hellboy to the one who can show him his destiny.

1146
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,560
不好意思  我打斷你們了嗎
Sorry! Did I interrupt?

1147
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,390
地獄男爵  你個混蛋
Hellboy, you bastard!

1148
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,680
我希望我沒遲到
I hope I'm not late to the party!

1149
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,680
你來得正是時候
You've arrived just in time.

1150
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,260
數量太多了
There's too many.

1151
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:38,930
放開他
Get off him!

1152
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,490
你後面
Behind you!

1153
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,410
你從哪兒學來的
Where'd you learn how to do that?

1154
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,140
我不知道  自從我被精靈帶走
I don't know. Ever since the fairies took me,

1155
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,130
我就能做一些奇怪的事
I've been able to do some weird shit.

1156
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,420
躲在我身後
Stay behind me.

1157
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,330
我還能去哪兒
Where else am I gonna go?

1158
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,680
帶我們離開這裡
Get us out of here!

1159
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,860
知道什麼時候該等待
Know when to wait.

1160
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,640
現在沒那麼好笑了  是吧
Not so fucking funny now, eh?

1161
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,700
皇后陛下  恢復我的力量  讓我幹掉他
My Queen, restore me now! Let me finish him!

1162
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,300
現在還不行
Not just yet.

1163
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,040
但是你發過誓...
But you swore...

1164
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,950
管好你的舌頭  豬頭
Mind your tongue, pig.

1165
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:23,880
快走
Move it.

1166
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,230
進去
Get in.

1167
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,400
你想去哪兒
Where do you think you're going?

1168
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:38,200
去孕育一個新的世界
To give birth to a new world!

1169
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,870
是啊  通過殺害許多無辜的人
Yeah, by killing a lot of innocent people!

1170
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:46,240
為什麼你要為那些憎恨和恐懼你的人而戰
Why do you fight for those who hate and fear you?

1171
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,470
見到你之前  我只想要復仇
All I wanted was revenge, until I saw you.

1172
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,920
但你可以迎來世界末日
You can usher in the apocalypse.

1173
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,030
灰燼中將誕生新的伊甸園
Out of the ashes, a new Eden will emerge.

1174
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,820
拋下這些脆弱可憐的人類
Leave these frail, pathetic humans behind.

1175
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:02,450
做我的國王  以你的真實身份接受愛戴
Be my king. And be revered for who you really are.

1176
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,880
我們屬於彼此  你和我
We belong together, you and I.

1177
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,120
確實如此  但是行不通的  你知道
We do! But it's not gonna work, you know,

1178
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,700
因為我是摩羯座  而你是他媽瘋子座
'cause I'm a Capricorn and you're fucking nuts!

1179
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:16,480
你的體內沉睡著惡魔  我會喚醒它
A demon sleeps inside you, and I will waken it.

1180
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,430
地獄男爵  地獄男爵
Hellboy! Hellboy!

1181
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,870
即使我必須奪走你所愛過的
Even if I have to take away everything

1182
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,130
一切人事物
and everyone you've ever loved.

1183
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,830
我來了  孩子
I got you, kid.

1184
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,630
恭喜你  血皇后恢復了全部力量
Congratulations, the Blood Queen has all her powers now.

1185
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,450
別碰它
Don't touch it!

1186
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,620
那只會讓它擴散得更快
It'll only make it spread faster.

1187
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,700
給你三秒鐘時間來彌補
You got three seconds to make this right!

1188
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,720
我做不到
I can't.

1189
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,630
三
Three.

1190
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,650
妮繆的力量太強大了
Nimue's power is too strong.

1191
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:54,720
二
Two.

1192
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,360
舊世界有一個人可以幫助你
There is one who can help you from the Old World.

1193
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,070
在哪兒
Where?

1194
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,140
你不會真要聽她的吧
You're not seriously gonna listen to her!

1195
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,090
她可能會把我們引入陷阱
She could be leading us straight into a trap!

1196
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,510
你可以救你的朋友
You can save your friend.

1197
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,700
我們別無選擇
We don't have a choice.

1198
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,100
去黑鰭山
Go to Black Fin.

1199
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,460
在懸崖頂上
High atop the cliffs

1200
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,790
岩石中隱藏著一條古老的牧羊道
there's an old goat path hidden in the rocks.

1201
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,530
這條路充滿危險
The way is treacherous,

1202
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:22,610
但你必須沿著它走到盡頭
but you must follow it until you can go no further.

1203
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,130
在那  你會在山洞中找到通往地球內部的通道
There, you'll find a passage into the bowels of the Earth, in a cave.

1204
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,340
這邊  戴米奧
This way, Daimio.

1205
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,890
你要找的人就在那裡
The one you seek is there.

1206
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,370
智者梅林
Merlin the Wise.

1207
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:34,810
國王的巫師  愚者的國王
Wizard to kings, and king of fools.

1208
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:37,600
因為允許亞瑟背叛停戰協議
Cursed to live forever buried in a hole

1209
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,880
而被詛咒永遠活埋在洞裡
for allowing Arthur to betray the truce.

1210
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,700
你終於要帶走我的靈魂了嗎
Have you finally come to claim my soul?

1211
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,190
我不是死神
That's the other guy.

1212
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,500
快點  我的朋友中毒了
Come on! My friend's been poisoned,

1213
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,650
有人告訴我們你能幫忙
and we were told that you can help!

1214
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,660
我見過這個  這是妮繆干的
I have seen this before. This is Nimue's work.

1215
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,390
你不能小瞧這個女巫
You cannot underestimate this witch.

1216
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:13,120
她是邪惡的化身
She is evil incarnate.

1217
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,520
如果我們迅速行動  還有機會
There's still a chance if we act quickly.

1218
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,790
但作為回報  你必須答應我一件事
But you must promise me something in return.

1219
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,560
你要不惜一切代價
That you will do whatever is necessary

1220
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,380
摧毀妮繆
to destroy Nimue, no matter the cost.

1221
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,130
我他媽保證做到
I can damn well guarantee it.

1222
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:43,860
[咒語]

1223
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,070
我們不用擔心那東西要去哪嗎
Should we be worried about where that's going?

1224
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,620
歡迎回來
Welcome back.

1225
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,310
新來的是誰
Who's the new guy?

1226
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,460
我說了你肯定不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1227
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:05,940
你為什麼這麼做
Why did you do that?

1228
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,940
讓你的朋友休息  他們會沒事的
Let your friends rest. They'll be fine.

1229
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:10,720
接下來發生的事你要獨自面對
What comes next is for you and you alone.

1230
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,780
地獄男爵  你的故事在我耳邊低語
Hellboy, your story whispered itself into my ear

1231
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:18,660
我意識到命運對我們兩個另有安排
and I realized fate had something else in store for us both.

1232
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,900
-好吧  -告訴我
- Okay. - Tell me,

1233
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,190
你的時代中還有亞瑟王的傳說嗎
are there still tales of King Arthur in your time?

1234
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,440
他是怎樣從石頭中拔出劍來
How he drew the sword from the stone?

1235
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,010
是的  還有電影
Yeah. Movies, too.

1236
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,170
他是個常見的流行文化巨星
He's a regular pop culture phenom.

1237
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,410
把手給我
Give me your hand.

1238
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:36,620
人們以為亞瑟的血統隨他而去了
People believe that Arthur's lineage died with him,

1239
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,080
但那不是真的
but it's not true.

1240
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,180
亞瑟有了一個女兒  那個女兒又有了女兒
The bloodline continued when Arthur had a daughter

1241
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:44,210
如此繼續  血統就延續下去了
and that daughter had a daughter, and so on.

1242
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,570
最後一位是薩拉·貝瑟尼·休斯
Ending with Sarah Bethany Hughes.

1243
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,570
她曾在一個山羊形狀的
She used to fly to the Sabbath

1244
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:52,640
惡魔的背上飛向安息日
on the back of a demon in the shape of a goat.

1245
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,730
然後在1574年的五朔節前夕
And on Walpurgis Night, 1574,

1246
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,890
她嫁給了那個惡魔
she married that demon.

1247
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,900
就在那天晚上  她被拖下了地獄
That very night she was taken down to hell,

1248
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,780
她在那裡生下了一個兒子
where she delivered a son,

1249
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,990
阿努·恩·羅摩
Anung un Rama.

1250
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:13,070
最後那部分  我之前聽到過  那是什麼
That last part, I've heard that before. What is that?

1251
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:16,910
是你  阿努·恩·羅摩
It's you... Anung un Rama.

1252
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:19,460
萬物毀滅者
Destroyer of all things.

1253
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,000
你出生那天被授予的頭銜
The title you were given on the day you were born.

1254
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,940
所以我母親是人類
So, my mother was human.

1255
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,070
你也是人類  至少一部分是
And so are you. At least in part.

1256
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:35,100
亞瑟之子  王族最後的後裔
Son of Arthur, last of the royal lineage.

1257
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,770
他的血脈
Blood of his blood.

1258
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,100
注定要成為人類之王
Destined to be king of man.

1259
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,620
所以我知道你是
Which is why I know you are

1260
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,400
唯一一個能做到必要的事的人
the only one who can do what must be done.

1261
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:56,410
王者之劍  唯一可以對抗妮繆的武器
Excalibur, the one weapon that can stand against Nimue.

1262
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,750
在動畫裡看起來比這大
Looks bigger in the cartoon.

1263
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:04,330
只有亞瑟的真正後裔才能揮動它
Only a true descendant of Arthur can wield it.

1264
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:08,710
地獄男爵  這是你與生俱來的權力  你的命運
It is your birthright, Hellboy, your destiny.

1265
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:19,560
這就是你摧毀血皇后的方法
This is how you will destroy the Blood Queen.

1266
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:21,200
不  你答應過我的
No! You gave me your word!

1267
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:24,210
趁現在還來得及  把劍拔出來
Take the sword before it's too late!

1268
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,670
拔出來
Take it!

1269
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,170
快拔出來
Take it now!

1270
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,090
你個傻瓜
You fool!

1271
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:35,650
我用最後的魔力把王者之劍帶到了這裡
I used the last of my magic to bring Excalibur here.

1272
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:38,440
現在劍回到了亞瑟身邊
Now the sword has returned to Arthur,

1273
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:41,100
唯一配得上它的人
the only man worthy of it.

1274
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,890
你本可以阻止她的
You could've stopped her.

1275
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,790
至少我不會在這裡
At least I won't be here

1276
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:50,480
看著這個世界凋零死亡
to watch the world wither and die.

1277
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:11,520
跑啊  對  快跑
Run! Yeah, go on, run.

1278
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,800
你們這些可悲的混蛋
You pathetic bastards.

1279
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:25,160
到目前為止  英國政府
So far, the British government

1280
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,620
還沒有找到這場正以

1281
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:30,540
前所未有的速度蔓延的瘟疫的源頭
which is spreading at an unprecedented rate.

1282
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,870
首相已官方宣佈
The Prime Minister has declared

1283
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:33,920
進入緊急狀態

1284
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,150
並敦促英國公民留在室內

1285
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:41,470
避免與任何可能被感染的人接觸
and to avoid contact with anyone who may be infected.

1286
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:45,190
預計傷亡人數將在兩小時內達到十萬人
Casualties are expected to reach 100,000 within two hours,

1287
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:53,970
{\an8}突發新聞

1290
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,140
造成大量死亡
over the next 24 hours

1291
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,440
並有可能引發全球疫情
and threatening to spark a global epidemic.

1292
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,650
聽好了  女士們先生們
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen.

1293
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,650
情況已經糟到不能更糟了
The shit has gone way beyond the fan.

1294
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:59,440
那裡有個來自五世紀的女巫
Out there, there's a fifth century sorceress

1295
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,570
和她的豬怪

1296
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:03,690
想要毀滅倫敦和整個世界
who want to bring down the curtain on London and the world.

1297
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:07,140
現在請告訴我  他們在哪兒
Now, please tell me where the fuck they are!

1298
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:17,690
我要看證件  親愛的
I need to see some ID, love.

1299
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:28,000
感染率遠遠高於最初...
The infection rate is much higher than initially...

1300
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,810
你要告訴我們下面發生了什麼嗎
You gonna tell us what happened down there?

1301
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:30,850
甘道夫去哪兒了
Where's Gandalf?

1302
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:34,090
他死了  他要把劍給我  王者之劍
He's dead. He offered me the sword, Excalibur.

1303
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,170
他說那是殺死血皇后的唯一方法
He said it was the only way to kill the Blood Queen.

1304
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,420
好吧  劍在哪呢
All right, so where is it?

1305
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:40,480
我沒拿劍
I didn't take the sword.

1306
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,320
因為如果我拿了  我就是那個
'Cause if I do, I'm the guy who's gonna

1307
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,970
開啟世界末日的人
bring about the end of the world.

1308
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:47,850
你是那個開啟世界末日的人
You're the guy who's going to bring about the end of the world?

1309
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,120
少自大了
Get over yourself.

1310
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,910
戴米奧
Daimio!

1311
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,440
我們有任務要完成
We've got a job to do.

1312
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:55,960
我們得走了
We've got to go.

1313
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,080
出什麼事了
What's wrong?

1314
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,280
血皇后剛剛攻破了超自然調查防禦局
The Blood Queen just took out the B.P.R.D.

1315
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,740

1316
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:26,680
我們會找到你爸爸的  他沒死

我在聖保羅大教堂外面

1320
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,490
就在那邊

1321
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:35,870
{\an8}聖保羅大教堂大屠殺

1322
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,540
數百名武裝警察繼續與一名
hundreds of armed police continue a shootout

1323
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,730
身份不明的襲擊者交火
with an unknown assailant.

1324
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,830
讓開
Get out of the way!

1325
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,100
我跟你們是一夥的
I'm on your side!

1326

-抱歉  我的錯  -十一軍

1327
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:18,520
任何情況下都不準進入
No one enters under any circumstances!

1328
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,860
她在哪兒
Where is she?

1329
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:27,160
爸
Dad!

1330
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,450
你好  地獄男爵
Hello, Hellboy.

1331
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:32,950
很抱歉皇后陛下不能親自來迎接你
Sorry my queen couldn't be here to greet you in person.

1332
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,230
這可不是好兆頭
That's not a good sign.

1333
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:39,850
他怎麼變得這麼大
How did he get so fucking big?

1334
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:42,190
地獄男爵  如你所見
Hellboy, as you can see,

1335
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:47,780
她確保了你能受到正式的歡迎
she's made sure you receive a proper fucking welcome.

1336
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:52,110
你不知道我等這一刻等了多久
You've no idea how long I've been waiting for this.

1337
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,660
我可以想像
I have some idea!

1338
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:57,950
要知道  我就是那個讓小豬仔
You know, I was the guy that sent little piggy squealing

1339
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:59,980
一路尖叫著跑回家的傢伙
all the way back home.

1340
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:01,730
找掩護
Take cover!

1341
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,030
我要把你的頭擰下來
I'll rip your fucking head off!

1342
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:18,830
當心
Look out!

1343
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:26,220
小豬仔  我帶來了你的最愛  鐵
Little piggy, I brought your favorite! Iron!

1344
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,690
這次不管用了
That's not gonna work this time.

1345
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,640
我抬不動
It won't budge!

1346
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,730
嘗嘗這個  混蛋
Take that, you fucker!

1347
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:43,940
過來  你...
Come here, you...

1348
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,240
該死的渾蛋
Fucking bastard.

1349
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,460
離開這裡
Get out of here.

1350
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,830
我不會就這麼扔下你
I'm not just gonna leave you!

1351
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,300
快走
Go!

1352
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,650
滾開
Fuck off!

1353
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,590
看看你  你的臉就像狒狒的屁股
Look at ya. You got a face like a baboon's ass.

1354
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:14,800
乖乖躺在那兒流血  讓我把我幹掉
Now just lay there and bleed while I finish you off.

1355
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,010
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

1356
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,370
祝你好運  夥計
Good luck with that, pal!

1357
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,880
該死的雜種
Fucking mutt.

1358
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,850
戴米奧
Daimio?

1359
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:39,310
我們吃烤肉吧
Let's eat some barbecue!

1360
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:53,840
-地獄男爵  -給我這個幹什麼
- Hellboy!  - What am I supposed to do with that?

1361
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,860
即興發揮
Improvise!

1362
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:19,470
我要砸爛你的腦袋
I'm gonna squash your fucking head now.

01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:22,100
-來吧  你個紅臉傻逼  -夠了
- Here, you red-faced twat! - Enough!

1364
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:23,910
陛下
Your Majesty.

1365
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:26,730
放過他  我的寵物
Let him go, my pet.

1366
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:31,630
我們說好的  我把你拼齊了
We had a deal. I found you.

1367
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:36,050
這一切都是我策劃的  我是一切的開始
I set all this in motion! I was the beginning of it all.

1368
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,740
而我是終點
And I am the end.

1369
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:44,370
原諒我  我需要有人挑戰地獄男爵
Forgive me. I needed someone to challenge Hellboy,

1370
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,580
把他逼到絕境
push him to the edge.

1371
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:49,960
但你答應過的
But you promised!

1372
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,340
答應恢復你的力量
To make you whole again.

1373
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:55,090
無與倫比的強大
Powerful beyond compare.

1374
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,970
在短暫閃耀的時間內
And for one brief, shining moment,

1375
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,720
-確實實現了  -這不公平
- you were. - This ain't fair!

1376
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:07,020
你去死  地獄男爵
Fuck you, Hellboy!

1377
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,440
嗯  你也去死
Yeah, fuck you back.

1378
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,460
好了  該結束了
All right, time to finish this.

1379
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,320
但我不想殺你
But I don't want to kill you.

1380
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:19,720
我們不是敵人  我們被命運連結在一起
We are not enemies. We are bound together by fate!

1381
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,280
別再說這些廢話了  女士
Not this crap again, lady!

1382
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,410
有些教訓值得重複
Some lessons bear repeating.

1383
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,400
想想有多少人一生都在
Just think how many spent their lives

1384
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,440
尋找亞瑟的墳墓
searching for Arthur's tomb.

1385
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,440
它一直都在這裡
It's been right here all along.

1386
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,950
拔劍吧  這是你的權力
Go ahead. It's yours by right.

1387
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:03,080
你能感受到  不是嗎
You can feel it, can't you?

1388
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,830
它在呼喚你
How it calls to you.

1389
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:11,420
攪動你生命的核心
Stirring the thing at the core of your being.

1390
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:14,590
你注定要成為的人
The thing you're destined to be.

1391
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:19,510
拔劍吧
Go ahead, take it.

1392
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,970
你想殺我  不是嗎
You want to kill me, don't you?

1393
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:32,120
拔劍  拔劍
Pick up the sword. Take it!

1394
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,270
不
No!

1395
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,360
我不知道你在耍什麼把戲
I don't know what your game is here,

1396
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,280
但我不玩了
but I'm done playing!

1397
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,990
那好
Very well.

1398
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,120
爸  爸
Dad! Dad!

1399
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,540
別擔心我
Don't worry about me.

1400
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:56,350
你做你該做的  幹掉這個婊子
You do what you have to do and take out this bitch!

1401
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,900
不  妮繆  妮繆  不  放開他  妮繆
No! Nimue! Nimue, no! Let him go, Nimue!

1402
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:03,140
放開他  你想要的是我  來抓我
Let him go! It's me you want! Take me!

1403
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,390
你已經在我手上了
I already have you.

1404
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:10,770
你只是還不知道罷了
You just don't know it yet.

1405
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:17,400
不  不  不
No! No! No!

1406
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,110
爸
Dad!

1407
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,950
爸
Dad?

1408
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,700
不  求你別死
No. Please don't go.

1409
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:35,580
不
No!

1410
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:40,630
老天  夥計  你真是一團糟
Jesus Christ, mate. You're a mess.

1411
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:41,980
好吧  至少現在我知道為什麼
Well, at least now I know why

1412
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:44,010
你一直表現的像個該死的混蛋了
you've been acting like such a fucking dick.

1413
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,720
我需要你立刻振作起來
I need you to pull it together now!

1414
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,510
他需要我們的幫助
He needs our help.

1415
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,390
別哭了
Save your tears.

1416
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,790
比起我為全人類準備的下場
His death is a mercy compared to

1417
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:58,150
他的死是一種仁慈
what I have in store for the rest of mankind.

1418
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:02,420
都是因為在你有機會使用王者之劍時
All because you were too cowardly to use Excalibur

1419
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,700
你太懦弱了
when you had the chance.

1420
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,420
你的兩個父親都會以你為恥
Both your fathers would be ashamed!

1421
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,660
妮繆
Nimue!

1422
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,240
到我這兒來
Come to me.

1423
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,120
到我這兒來
Come to me.

1424
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:56,580
來
Come.

1425
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:34,050
你太美了
You're so beautiful.

1426
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:37,270
現在你明白了  我們生來就要共同統治
Now you see that we were born to rule together.

1427
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:39,480
亞瑟只是個凡人
Arthur was just a man.

1428
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,810
在他手中  王者之劍是死亡的工具
In his hands, Excalibur was an instrument of death.

1429
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:46,650
但在你手中  你可以建立新的世界
But in yours, you can build a new world,

1430
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:50,110
為我們的同類建立更美好的世界
a better world for all our kind.

1431
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,700
陛下
My Lord.

1432
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:25,900
住手
Stop!

1433
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:34,450
這不是你  地獄男爵  你不是這樣的人
This isn't you, Hellboy. You're better than this.

1434
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:39,760
別聽這個老傻瓜的話  這是你命中注定的
Don't listen to this old fool. You were meant for this.

1435
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,600
她想利用你
She wants to use you,

1436
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,060
扭曲你的本性
make you into something you're not.

1437
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:47,130
所以別再發牢騷了
So stop being a whiny little shit

1438
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,300
向她證明她錯了
and show her she's wrong.

1439
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:52,220
勇往直前  擁抱你的命運
Go forth and embrace your destiny.

1440
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,470
摧毀你的敵人
Destroy your enemies!

1441
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:58,310
沒完沒了地嘮叨抱怨命運
All this bitching and moaning about destiny.

1442
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:01,700
成熟點吧  你是個男人
Grow a pair! You're a man!

1443
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:04,730
而且是個好人  做個好人
And a good one! Act like it.

1444
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:07,820
別讓預言告訴你你是誰
Don't let a prophecy tell you who you are.

1445
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,030
你自己做決定
You decide for yourself.

1446
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,690
他在撒謊
He's lying!

1447
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:16,170
你是世界末日的偉大野獸
You are the great beast of the apocalypse.

1448
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:19,410
這就是真正的你  一直都是
This is the real you! It always has been.

1449
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:21,080
燒盡過去
Burn out the past.

1450
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:24,460
擺脫弱點
Be rid of the weakness.

1451
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:31,630
我的國王
My King.

1452
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,770
還沒結束
This isn't over!

1453
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,960
我們注定要在一起
We are destined for one another!

1454
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,210
我們會再見面的
We will meet again

1455
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:38,990
在世界末日的最後一天
on the last day of the ending of the world!

1456
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,450
女士  別說了  你還剩
Lady, quit while you're...

1457
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,300
-一個頭  -不
- A head.  - No!

1458
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:51,770
不
No!

1459
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:02,390
你早就知道  對不對
You knew, didn't you?

1460
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:04,310
一直都知道
This whole time.

1461
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,640
我體內的這個野獸
This beast inside me.

1462
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:10,100
我內心的本性
My inner nature!

1463
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,730
我的命運
My destiny!

1464
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,940
你也知道
So did you.

1465
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,780
那麼多年前你為什麼不殺了我
Why didn't you kill me all those years ago?

1466
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:21,030
你有任務
You had a job,

1467
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,740
保護世界不受怪物的侵害
to protect the world from monsters!

1468
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:30,790
我從來沒有為那晚做的決定後悔過
I have never, ever regretted the decision I made that night.

1469
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,060
爸
Dad...

1470
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:38,470
閉嘴聽我說  我有話要說
Shut up and listen to me. There's things I need to say.

1471
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:42,430
我盡力做我能做到的最好的父親
I tried to be the best father I could.

1472
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,680
我怎麼知道怎麼養孩子
What the hell did I know about raising a kid?

1473
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:48,120
我是個殺手  而且很在行
I was a killer, and damn good at it.

1474
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,740
有些野獸罪有應得  有些則不是
Some beasts deserved it, some didn't.

1475
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:53,960
但我做了我認為必要的事
But I did what I believed was necessary.

1476
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,170
如果我死後有機會變成天使
And if I have any chance of growing wings,

1477
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:57,360
那都是因為你
it's because of you.

1478
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:01,570
你改變了我
You changed me.

1479
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,410
你改變了一切
You changed everything.

1480
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:10,620
如果這場看似永無止境的戰爭有結束的時候
And if there is ever an end in this seemingly forever war,

1481
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:15,210
那將是因為你和你強大的右手
it will be because of you and your strong right hand.

1482
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:20,260
你是人類最好的  也是唯一的希望  孩子
You are mankind's best and only hope, my boy.

1483
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:26,350
求你了  求你別死  我還沒準備好
Please. Please don't go. I'm not ready.

1484
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:28,770
不  你準備好了
Oh, yes, you are.

1485
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:34,230
做你的父親是我做過的最好的決定
Being your father was the best decision I ever made.

1486
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:37,400
我愛你  地獄男爵
I love you, Hellboy.

1487
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,980
我愛你  地獄男爵
I love you, Hellboy.

1488
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:09,850
那是什麼
What's that?

1489
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:11,180
一個錯誤
A mistake.

1490
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:18,940
我喜歡貓
I like cats.

1491
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,320
我一直都更喜歡狗
I've always been more of a dog person.

1492
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,750
那麼  現在你是英格蘭國王了
So, you're the king of England now.

1493
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:34,210
-對啊  -好吧  我真沒想到
- Yup.  - Well, I didn't see that coming.

1494
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:51,850
{\an8}六個月後

1495
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:57,070
{\an8}西伯利亞

1496
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,940
好了  我們到了
Okay, yeah, we're here.

1497
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:59,520
有人收到嗎  有人...
Does anybody copy? Does any...

1498
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,900
沒用的廢物
Worthless piece of crap!

1499
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,050
奧尼斯協會
The Oannes Society.

1500
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,000
{\an8}從太陽神厄裡奧皮克兄弟協會中分裂出的團體

1501
01:46:10,050 --> 01:46:11,990
他們讓俄賽裡斯會社看起來像是童子軍
They make Osiris look like Cub Scouts.

1502
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:14,850
老天  又一個秘密男孩俱樂部嗎
Christ! Another secret boys club?

1503
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:17,750
一群瘋子  他們在這裡幹什麼
Bunch of lunatics. What are they doing here?

1504
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:19,380
我們的後援呢
And where's our back-up?

1505
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,230
拜託
Come on!

1506
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:24,980
不要這樣鬼鬼祟祟地靠近我
