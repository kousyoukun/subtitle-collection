公元517年
The year is 517 A.D.,

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,900
史称黑暗时代
known as the Dark Ages

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,240
而名字的来由显而易见
and for fucking good reason.

4
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,340
一场人类军队与黑暗生物之间
An endless war between the armies of man

5
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,190
永无休止的战争
and the creatures of darkness

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,990
席卷了英国
has raged across Britain.

7
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,680
为了报复人类对黑暗生物的不公之举
And in retribution for man's injustices to creatures,

8
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,950
永生不死的女巫薇薇安·妮缪
the immortal witch Vivienne Nimue

9
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,320
传播了致命的瘟疫
had spread her deadly plague

10
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,160
威胁要把人类从地球上彻底消灭
threatening to wipe mankind off the face of the Earth.

11
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,800
{\an8}彭德尔山
公元517年

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,220
于是在彭德尔山上  一棵古老的橡树下
And so at Pendle Hill, beneath an ancient oak tree,

13
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,790
亚瑟王  没错  就是那个亚瑟王
King Arthur... Yes, that King Arthur,

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,940
和他法术高强的巫师梅林
and his powerful wizard Merlin,

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,430
被迫向血皇后妮缪投降
were forced to surrender to Nimue, the Queen of Blood.

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,370
看看这是谁
Well, well, well.

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,820
伟大的亚瑟王驾临彭德尔山
The great King Arthur comes to Pendle Hill.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,300
然而  带着深信人类与怪物
However, believing man and monster

19
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,090
永远也无法和睦共处的想法
were never meant to live in harmony,

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,880
亚瑟偷袭了妮缪
Arthur ambushed Nimue.

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,220
而她最信任的女巫戈内达背叛了她
Betrayed by her most trusted witch, Ganeida.

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,890
凡人的兵器伤不了我
No mortal weapon can harm me.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,730
-王者之剑  -这可不是凡人的兵器
- Excalibur! - This is no mortal weapon.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,860
盛怒之下
Pissed off,

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,820
妮缪释放了致命的瘟疫
Nimue unleashed her deadly plague.

26
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,560
不
No!

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,620
轻轻一挥
With one swing

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,470
传说中的王者之剑
of his legendary sword,

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,830
亚瑟砍下了血皇后之首
Arthur severed the Blood Queen's head.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,430
即便如此  也无法阻止她
But even that wasn't enough to stop her.

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,250
所以他将血皇后砍碎
So he had her cut up into pieces,

32
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,890
并将每一块都分别锁在不同的棺材里
each one locked in a separate casket.

33
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,750
一切尚未结束  我永生永世都要复仇
This is not over. I am vengeance eternal!

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,970
不
No!

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,690
神圣的祷告者将其封印
Sealed with a holy prayer.

36
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,430
只有圣徒的言语才能打破这道圣印
Only the words from a man of God may break this holy seal.

37
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,630
随后  亚瑟命令其最勇敢的骑士们骑马离去
Arthur then ordered his bravest knights to ride off

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,050
将她邪恶的残骸埋葬在大地尽头
and bury her wretched remains in the far reaches of the land,

39
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,210
没有人能找到的地方
where no one would ever find her.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,100
即使是魔鬼本尊也无济于事
Not even the devil himself.

41
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,830
{\an8}地狱男爵

42
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,720
我是认真的  儿子
I mean it, son.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,580
不准喝酒  不准打架  不要挑事
No drinking, no fighting, don't cause a scene.

44
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,720
{\an8}提华纳
今时今日

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,760
爸  别紧张  我又不是第一次来提华纳
Relax, Dad. It's not my first time in Tijuana.

46
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,590
你以为我为什么要跟你说这些
Why do you think I'm telling you all this?

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,080
鲁伊兹是我朋友  我只是想把他带回来
Ruiz is my friend. I just wanna bring him back.

48
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,970
鲁伊兹探员不是你朋友
Agent Ruiz is not your friend.

49
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,760
他只是你的一个酒友
He's someone you get drunk with.

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,560
三周前
Three weeks ago,

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,350
我们派鲁伊兹探去调查一个吸血鬼巢穴
we sent Ruiz to investigate a nest of vampires.

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,960
自那之后  他就没消息了
We haven't heard from him since.

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
交给我
I'm on it.

54
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,510
我收到可靠消息  知道在哪能找到他
A reliable source told me where I can find him.

55
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,650
找到他就打给我
Call me when you have him.

56
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,520
我不会打给你的
I'm not going to call you.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,770
打给我  这是个简单的寻人任务
Just call me! It's a simple extraction.

58
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,800
带鲁伊兹离开那里
Get Ruiz out of there

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
说声再见就闪人  别又把事情搞大了
and bid adios without making a big mess. Again.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
交给我  爸
I got this, Dad!

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,220
{\an8}爸

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,570
你知道我的  我很温柔
You know me, I have a gentle touch.

63
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,110
该死  又坏了
Shit! Not again.

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,930
{\an8}摔跤

65
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,770
坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹
Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz!

66
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,490
坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹
Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz!

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,080
{\an2}{\pos(250,220)}今晚我们请来了一位名人

68
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,540
{\an2}世上最伟大的超自然现象调查员

69
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,060
{\an2}地狱男爵

70
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,500
{\an2}我们打一场  不死不休

71
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,010
鲁伊兹  埃斯特班  是你吗
Ruiz! Esteban, is that you?

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,850
{\an2}{\pos(150,220)}埃斯特班  我不是他了  我是坎马卓兹

73
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,260
坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹
Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz! Camazotz!

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,930
坎马卓兹  坎马卓兹
Camazotz! Camazotz!

75
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,780
坎马卓兹是什么鬼
What's up with the Camazotz crap, huh?

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
超自然调查防御局派你来这里
The B.P.R.D. sends you down here,

77
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,320
调查一个吸血鬼巢穴
investigate a nest of vampires

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,270
但是你三周前失联了
and you went silent about three weeks ago.

79
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,350
我想你了  伙计
I miss you, man.

80
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,670
别闹了  我是来带你回去的
Come on, I'm here to bring you back in.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,540
来吧  兄弟  我们走
Come on, buddy, let's go.

82
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,450
那就来带我回去吧
So come on, bring me in.

83
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,930
{\an2}对打  对打  对打

84
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,440
好吧
Okay.

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,390
好吧
Okay.

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,530
{\an2}上吧  恶魔

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,380
{\an2}野兽去死

88
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,410
好吧  你是怎么了
Okay. Hey, what happened to you, man?

89
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,600
你这是什么打扮
What's with the get-up, huh?

90
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,940
{\an2}{\pos(150,220)}我在训练

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,670
训练  训练什么
Training? Training for what?

92
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,870
为了杀你
To kill you!

93
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,660
好吧  帮我拿着
Okay. Hang on to that for me.

94
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,800
紫色很适合你
You look good in purple.

95
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,650
好疼
Ouch!

96
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,010
玩够了吧
It's been a lot of fun.

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,350
我们能走了吗
Can we get out of here?

98
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,320
他们对你做了什么
What did they do to you?

99
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,530
鲁伊兹  我们去喝杯酒好好聊聊
Ruiz! Let's have a drink and talk about this!

100
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,750
你是个好探员
You're a good agent!

101
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,870
兄弟  别这样  你不记得了吗
Buddy, come on. Come on, don't you remember?

102
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,730
我们在后院  坐在门廊喝啤酒
Backyards? Drinking beers on the porch?

103
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,620
我们还一起弹过吉他呢
We used to play guitar, man!

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,550
虽然你弹的都是不插电的嬉皮士垃圾
You-you'd play all that hippy acoustic crap

105
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,090
而我弹的才叫音乐
and I'd play real music.

106
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,020
去你妈的
To hell with this!

107
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,850
对不起  伙计
I'm sorry, man.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,010
你没事吧
Are you okay?

109
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,590
别这样  我不想弄伤你  搭档
Come on, I don't wanna hurt you, partner.

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,050
我知道你还没有完全迷失  回应我一下
I know you're in there somewhere. Talk to me.

111
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,360
你喜欢扮英雄
You play the hero,

112
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,870
但我知道面具之下你的真面目
but I really know what is under your mask.

113
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,080
是吗  那我们就揭开你的面具看看吧
Oh, yeah? Is that so? Let's see what's under yours.

114
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,710
鲁伊兹  别闹了
Ruiz! Stop this!

115
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,690
不  不
No! No!

116
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,260
鲁伊兹
Ruiz.

117
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,080
我认识你  阿努·恩·罗摩
I know you... Anung un Rama.

118
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,310
你的心因愤怒而跳动
Your heart beats with rage.

119
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,130
我知道你最终会选择哪一边
I know which side you'll choose at the end.

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
对不起
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,340
对不起  我不是故意的  我...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I...

122
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,780
{\an2}终结即将来临...

123
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,270
没关系  小家伙
That's okay, little guy.

124
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,220
你只是生性如此
You're just doing what you're doing.

125
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,820
我不会怪你的
I'm not judging.

126
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,890
地狱男爵
Hellboy.

127
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,500
不  我是乔什
No, it's Josh.

128
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,920
我经常被人认错
People confuse us all the time.

129
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,370
来吧  我们得走了
Come on, we gotta go.

130
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,870
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

131
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,310
推特  你可算不上低调
Twitter. You don't exactly blend.

132
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,770
鲁伊兹的事我很遗憾  但我们得带你回去
Look, sorry about Ruiz, but we gotta take you back.

133
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,930
你们可以试试
You can try!

134
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,380
别这样  大块头  别激动
Come on, big guy. Easy.

135
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,930
我们只是奉命行事
We're just following orders.

136
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,630
他想要你回去
He wants you back.

137
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,170
是老头派你们来的
The old man sent you?

138
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,180
他只跟我们说事关重要
All he told us is its important.

139
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,260
我们得走了
We need to go.

140
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,190
{\an2}朋友

141
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,140
{\an2}再给我拿一瓶

142
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,490
他们买单
They're buying.

143
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,210
{\an8}科罗拉多州

144
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,640
{\an8}超自然调查防御局

145
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,580
{\an8}弗吉尼亚·佩恩
维克托·凯斯特勒
埃斯特班·鲁伊兹

146
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,300
{\an8}超自然调查防御局

147
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,550
墨西哥的悲剧事件
Details are still emerging

148
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,910
仍不断有细节浮出水面
with regard to the tragic events in Mexico.

149
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,700
关于地狱男爵  以及他效力的
There's very little information known about Hellboy

150
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,220
神秘机构  我们知之甚少
or the secretive agency that apparently he works for.

151
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,260
你漏了一块  我来吧
You missed a spot. May I?

152
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,060
爸
Dad.

153
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,540
我父亲常说
My father used to say

154
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,870
刮胡子是一天之中最重要的事
shaving was the most important part of a day.

155
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,020
这是绅士和非利士人的区别
Separated the gentlemen from the Philistines.

156
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,020
{\an8}爱琴海中的岛民

157
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,110
只有真男人才会每天拿着刀
It takes a real man to hold a blade

158
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,250
抵在自己的喉咙上
against his own throat every day

159
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,300
却不割断颈静脉
and not cut the jugular.

160
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,860
布鲁姆爷爷
Grandpa Bruttenholm,

161
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,050
他心中尽是泰迪熊和彩虹
he was all teddy bears and rainbows.

162
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,210
他是个冥顽不灵的混蛋
He was an unrepentant asshole,

163
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,540
但是他教会了我怎么刮胡子
but he taught me how to shave.

164
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,160
有其父必有其子
Like father, like son.

165
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,420
在龙舌兰酒里烂醉三周
Drowning in tequila for three weeks

166
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,310
也许能暂时麻痹伤痛
may temporarily numb the pain.

167
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,620
但其实只会加剧你的悲伤
All it ever really does is exacerbate your sorrows

168
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,180
恶化你的肝脏
and the state of your liver.

169
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,610
我知道鲁伊兹探员的事让你很难过
I know you're upset about Agent Ruiz,

170
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,100
但这份工作就是这样
but it's part of the job.

171
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,480
大家都明白这一点
Everyone here knows that.

172
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,060
是我杀了他  不是工作
Job didn't kill him, I did.

173
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,900
我在圣母瓜达卢佩教堂边上
And I buried him 16 feet under the earth

174
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,640
把他埋在了十六英尺深的地下
right by the chapel of the Virgin Guadalupe,

175
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,740
为了能让他安息
just to make it proper.

176
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,200
他变成了邪恶的吸血鬼
He had become unholy, a vampyre,

177
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
无可救药的黑暗生物
a creature of darkness beyond salvation.

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,930
无可救药的黑暗生物
A creature of darkness beyond salvation?

179
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,970
你是说不是每个人都能像我一样偶尔
You mean, we don't all just deserve a little gentle horn shave

180
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,040
-磨一磨角吗  -你不一样
- every now and then? - You're different.

181
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,170
你一直都与众不同
You always have been.

182
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,470
如果我的脸能说话  一定会反对你
If my face could talk, it would disagree with you.

183
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,280
我认为你的脸很帅气
I think it's a beautiful face.

184
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,870
终结即将来临  什么终结
The end is coming. The end of what?

185
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,560
我不知道  这是鲁伊兹的临终遗言
I don't know. Those were Ruiz's last words.

186
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,310
还有什么阿努·恩...
That and something about Anung nun...

187
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,030
你有印象吗
Does it ring any bells?

188
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,930
没  世界末日的胡言乱语
Nah. Apocalyptic mutterings.

189
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,110
好了  真是帅气逼人
Now there... Don't you look handsome!

190
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,400
我相信你的话  老爸
I'm gonna take your word for that, Pops.

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,200
话说  你为什么叫我回来
Why'd you bring me back, anyway?

192
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,370
别说是因为你想我了
Don't tell me it's 'cause you miss me.

193
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,040
你还记得俄赛里斯会社吗
Do you recall the Osiris Club?

194
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,100
记得  泽西岛的脱衣舞俱乐部
Yeah. Strip joint in Jersey.

195
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,020
不是  另一个
No, the other one.

196
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,940
太阳神厄里奥皮克兄弟协会的资深成员
The British occult society formed in 1866

197
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,970
在1866年成立的英国秘会
by the ranking members of the Heliopic Brotherhood of Ra.

198
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,920
太阳神  我在阴间见过太阳神一次
Ra? I met Ra once in the underworld.

199
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,300
他喜欢近距离和人说话
He's a close-talker.

200
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,170
和我们一样  他们也对抗黑暗势力
You know, like us, they fight against the forces of darkness

201
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,390
我们的组织之间有长期的合作关系
and our organizations have a long-standing relationship.

202
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,820
他们是我的老朋友
They're old friends of mine.

203
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,390
他们想请你帮忙解决一个巨大的问题
And they've requested your assistance with a giant problem.

204
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,370
-是吗  什么问题  -巨人
- Oh, yeah? What's that? - Giants.

205
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,280
地狱男爵剥夺了我可能拥有的生活
Hellboy stole the life I might've had.

206
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,530
把我放逐到这个悲惨的境地
Banished me into an existence of misery.

207
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,600
现在我活着就是为了杀他
I now only live to kill him.

208
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,730
我也遭受过地狱男爵的摧残
I too have suffered at Hellboy's hands,

209
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,770
所以我了解你的痛苦
so I know your pain.

210
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,720
我感同身受  所以我召唤你前来
I felt yours, so I summoned you here.

211
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,920
我会带你去找一位女巫  薇薇安·妮缪
I will guide you to a witch, Vivienne Nimue,

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,590
虽然被砍碎  但她还活着并持机等待
cut to pieces but alive and waiting.

213
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,990
复原她
Restore her!

214
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,190
她会让你再次强大起来
She will make you powerful again

215
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,910
这样你就能复仇了
so you can have your vengeance.

216
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,410
-谢谢你  -过程会很艰难
- I thank you. - This is not going to be easy.

217
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,270
也许如此
Maybe not.

218
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,230
但是为了恢复力量  我能做到
But to be whole again, I can do it.

219
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,720
去吧
Go now.

220
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,710
我不明白  这事对你有什么好处
I don't get it. What's in it for you?

221
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,830
这就不用你操心了  野兽
That is no concern of yours, beast!

222
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,500
最终  我自有安排
In the end, I'll have my way

223
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,540
而地狱男爵将会付出代价
and Hellboy will pay what he owes.

224
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,250
{\an8}英国

225
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,970
{\an8}俄赛里斯会社

226
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,060
您的客人到了  阁下
Your guest, m'lord.

227
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,450
地狱男爵  欢迎  我是亚当·格拉伦勋爵
Hellboy, welcome. Lord Adam Glaren.

228
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,550
请容我为你介绍我的同僚
And may I introduce my associates,

229
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,840
艾德文·卡普博士和奥古斯特·斯温
Dr. Edwin Carp and August Swain.

230
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,730
你们好  你们去过泽西岛的俄赛里斯俱乐部吗
Hi. You guys ever been to the Osiris Club in Jersey?

231
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,740
和这里差不多  不过那里有脱衣舞女郎
It's like this, but just with strippers.

232
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,590
我可以摸吗
May I?

233
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,390
有何特别之处吗
Does it do anything special?

234
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,230
嗯  砸起东西来得心应手
Yeah, it smashes things real good.

235
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,940
我们很高兴你接受了我们的邀请
We are so very glad you accepted our invitation.

236
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,570
我没得可选
Wasn't really my choice.

237
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,970
是的  教授让你来的
Yes. The Professor.

238
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,290
我和你父亲是老相识了
Your father and I go back a long way.

239
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,310
我有所耳闻
Yeah, I heard.

240
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,810
俄赛里斯会社一直致力于保存
The Osiris Club has been long dedicated to preserving

241
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,560
大不列颠的秘史
the secret history of Great Britain.

242
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,780
对于像你这样的人  会社为我们
It affords us certain insights

243
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,710
提供了独到的见解
into individuals such as yourself.

244
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,210
我们有时也会向你们超自然调查防御局
We've also given vital counsel

245
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,320
提供重要的建议
to your B.P.R.D. on occasion.

246
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,170
听着  我们别废话了好吗
Look, maybe we could just get on with it.

247
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,800
除非你们让我飞越了半个地球
Unless you flew me halfway around the world

248
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,630
只是为了给我上一堂历史课
just so that we could, uh, have a little history lesson.

249
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,340
或许我们应该直接展示给你看
Perhaps we should just show you.

250
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,390
暗门
Secret door.

251
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,510
巨人曾经统治过不列颠群岛
Giants once dominated the British Isles.

252
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,820
一群邪恶的  令人作呕的生物
Vile, loathsome creatures.

253
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,360
既可能看你一眼  又可能一口吃掉你
As likely to eat you as look at you.

254
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,820
它们一直都是个麻烦
They've always been a problem.

255
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,820
整个英国到处都埋着他们的尸体
Bodies buried all over England.

256
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,930
巨人有一个古怪的特点
It's a curious feature of giants

257
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
他们偶尔会从坟墓中爬出来
that they occasionally rise from their graves

258
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,420
大肆破坏
and wreak havoc.

259
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,680
这种时候  我们就会组织一场狩猎
And when they do, we organize a hunt.

260
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,060
{\an8}欧洲民间神话  超自然的猎人在野外追逐猎物
通常预示着灾难

261
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,060
-狂猎  -好名字
- The wild hunt. - Oh, catchy.

262
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,340
我还以为我的头就够大了
And I thought I had a big head.

263
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,280
显然你们在这方面是老鸟了
Clearly, you guys are old pros at this.

264
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,690
为什么还要我来帮你们杀一个巨人
Why do you need me to help you kill a giant?

265
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,200
实际上是三个
Three giants, actually.

266
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,440
一个  我们没问题  甚至两个也能对付
One, we can handle, perhaps even two.

267
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
但是三个加在一起  就是另外一回事了
But three, that's a different matter altogether.

268
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,620
这个特殊的三人组
This particular trio

269
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,750
威胁着新森林地区[英国南部]is terrorizing the New Forest.

270
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,630
吮吸那些不幸与之
Sucking on the bones of anyone

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,880
发生冲突的人的骨头
unlucky enough to fall foul of them.

272
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,380
要知道  他们对骨髓欲罢不能
The marrow, you see. They can't get enough.

273
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,070
如果有巨人到达人口密集的地方
So, if any were to reach a population center...

274
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,370
那就好玩了
It's Miller time.

275
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,970
这不是轻而易举的任务  地狱男爵
This is not a task to be taken lightly, Hellboy.

276
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,850
这些是巨人僵尸  非常难搞
These are Gigantum Mortis. Very unpleasant.

277
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,450
问你父亲就知道了
Just ask your father.

278
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,710
崔沃也曾受邀加入狩猎
Trevor was a guest of the hunt,

279
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,230
我们在1943年合力干掉了一个巨人
when we took one down in '43.

280
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,810
我早就知道我爸老得很慢  但是你们...
I always knew Dad aged well, but you guys...

281
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,200
照片就像是昨天拍的一样
Picture looks like it was taken yesterday.

282
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,630
这是有原因的
There's a reason for that.

283
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,280
你刚才准确地观察到的现象
The phenomenon you so rightly observed

284
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,460
源自于一场降神会
was the byproduct of a seance

285
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,800
我们四个人  还有你父亲布鲁姆教授
the four of us, along with your Professor Broom,

286
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,250
都参与了
were involved in

287
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,320
就在战争爆发前
just before the war.

288
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,430
请容我介绍我们的常驻先知
Allow me to introduce our resident seer,

289
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,360
伊丽莎白·哈顿夫人
Lady Elizabeth Hatton.

290
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,460
那天晚上我接触到的灵魂
The spirit I made contact with that night

291
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,670
异常地强大
was exceptionally powerful.

292
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,410
它警告我们有东西即将出现
It warned us that something was coming.

293
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,090
可能会终结人类的东西
Something that would end mankind.

294
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,420
而我们被选中去寻找并摧毁它
And that we'd been chosen to seek it out and destroy it.

295
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,950
自那之后  我们以蜗牛的速度缓慢衰老
Ever since, we've aged at a snail's pace

296
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,940
就是为了完成那个使命
in order to fulfill that mission

297
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,650
无论要耗费多久
no matter how long it took.

298
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,260
好吧  你们担心的这个东西
Okay. And this thing you're worried about,

299
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,010
它出现了吗
did it show up?

300
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,560
是的
Oh, yes.

301
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,220
你出现了
You did.

302
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,170
你来到这个世界的那晚  我就在现场
I was there the night that you came into the world.

303
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,020
那时第二次世界大战已接近尾声
World War II was coming to an end.

304
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,660
德国几乎被击败了
Germany was all but defeated.

305
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,360
但是纳粹还藏了最后一手
But the Nazis still had one last trick up their sleeve.

306
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,130
他们求助于臭名昭著的
They turned to the infamous

307
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,790
死灵法师格里戈里·拉斯普京
necromancer Grigori Rasputin.

308
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,010
在苏格兰海岸外的一个小岛上
On an island off the coast of Scotland,

309
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,980
他们聚在一起进行古老的神秘仪式
they gathered to invoke an ancient occult ritual...

310
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,900
想要把战局扭转成对德国有利的局面
intended to turn the tide of war back in Germany's favor.

311
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,570
但是出了差错
But something went wrong.

312
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,770
仪式没有完全按照他们的计划进行
The ritual didn't turn out quite as they planned.

313
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,660
{\an2}杀了他

314
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,920
幸运的是
Fortunately,

315
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,930
传奇纳粹猎人  龙虾队长赶到了
legendary Nazi hunter the Lobster arrived...

316
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,220
你们好
Guten Tag!

317
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,550
带领盟军进行了大胆的突袭
leading the allies on a daring raid.

318
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,430
再见
Goodbye.

319
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,130
来吧  让魔鬼知道是谁杀了你
Here, so the devil knows who sent you.

320
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,470
{\an2}{\pos(250,220)}去你的

321
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,330
至于你们这些踢正步的混蛋
As for the rest of you goose-stepping bastards,

322
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,640
小心我的热能手套
beware of my claw

323
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,410
因为我是来将你们所有人
for I have come to inflict justice

324
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,530
绳之以法的
on all of you.

325
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,270
布鲁姆教授和我
Professor Broom and myself

326
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,280
当时在和盟军合作
were working with the allies at the time.

327
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,130
凭借他对神秘仪式的了解
With his knowledge of the occult

328
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,560
以及我预见未来的天赋
and my gift of foresight,

329
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,760
我们率领秘密任务到达岛上
we led a secret mission to the island

330
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,590
准备杀死那晚从地狱深处召唤出来的
to kill whatever abomination was summoned

331
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,220
任何可憎之物
from the depths of hell that night.

332
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,980
等一下
Hold it!

333
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,230
接下来交给我
I'll take it from here.

334
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,490
但是我们发现了你
Instead, we found you.

335
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
你父亲从没跟你提起过  对吗
Your father never told you, did he?

336
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,500
那晚他究竟为什么在那里
Why he was really there that night?

337
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,310
他一定是忘说了
Must've slipped his mind.

338
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,580
拉斯普京把你作为武器带到了这个世界
Rasputin brought you in the world as a weapon.

339
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,260
怀着耐心和理解
With patience and understanding,

340
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,030
布鲁姆把那件武器变成了行善的利器
Broom turned that weapon into a force for good.

341
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,800
"耐心和理解"
"Patience and understanding."

342
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,700
你确定我们说的是同一个人吗
You sure we're talking about the same guy?

343
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,920
他在你身上看到了我们其他人看不到的东西
He saw something in you that the rest of us could not.

344
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,540
他把你当自己的儿子养大
And he raised you as his own son.

345
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,750
你应该休息一下  地狱男爵
You should get some rest, Hellboy.

346
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,150
黎明时集合狩猎
The hunt will assemble at dawn.

347
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,020
所以我不仅是恶魔之子  还是纳粹
So I'm devil spawn and a Nazi.

348
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,300
好极了  多谢  爸
Great. Thanks, Dad.

349
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,420
{\an8}爸

350
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,250
拜托
Come on!

351
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,180
{\an8}圣赛巴斯蒂安修道院

352
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,720
{\an8}请尊重我们的静默誓言

353
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,420
{\an8}这么晚不会是访客

354
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,390
{\an8}别开门

355
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,710
它在哪儿  修道士
Where is it, monk?

356
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,060
过来  你们这些混蛋
Come here, you fucking bastards!

357
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,210
过来  你们敢吗
Come here! Have you got it?

358
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,620
我很好奇  尖叫算不算打破你们的静默誓言
I wonder, does screaming break your vow of silence, brother?

359
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,900
你知道我在找什么  它在哪儿
You know what I'm looking for. Where is it?

360
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,290
带我去
Show me!

361
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,590
快点
Come on!

362
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,180
过来  修道士
Come here, monk!

363
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,930
我他妈讨厌铁
I fuckin' hate iron!

364
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,370
打开它  念咒语
Open it. Speak the words.

365
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,170
你知道只有圣徒的言语
You know only the words from a man of God

366
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,210
才能打破这道封印
can break the seal.

367
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,710
快他妈打开
Fucking open it!

368
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,270
难道什么事都得我自己做吗
Have I gotta do everything meself?

369
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,560
蠢货
Gobshite.

370
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,810
[咒语]

371
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,920
欢迎回来  陛下
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

372
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,700
怎么  我们是去讨糖果还是狩猎巨人
What, are we trick-or-treating or hunting giants?

373
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,070
这是传统  向以前勇敢的猎人致敬
Tradition. To honor the brave huntsmen who've come before.

374
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,430
那这些长刺刀呢
And the pig stickers?

375
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,450
另一个传统
Another tradition.

376
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,640
古往今来被巨人杀手所使用
Used by giant slayers throughout the ages.

377
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,760
当然也经过了现代技术的改造
With a few modern modifications, of course.

378
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,860
比电椅的威力强五倍
Five times as potent as an electric chair.

379
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,370
提醒你一下  这不足以杀死巨人  但是
Not enough to kill a giant, mind you. But, uh, still,

380
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,420
可以轻易制服那些生物  你想要一个吗
quite handy in subduing the creatures. Would you care for one?

381
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,920
不用了  我有自己的传统
It's all right, I got traditions of my own.

382
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,430
天哪  我不用戴帽子吧
Oh, God. I don't have to wear the hat, do I?

383
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,700
不用  我们很清楚
No. We're very well aware

384
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,120
你对头上的角很抵触
of your distaste for horns.

385
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,190
不过作为狩猎大师  戴上这件头饰
It's my honor, as master of the hunt,

386
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,230
是我的荣幸
to wear the headdress.

387
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,980
最后是这个  暗影
And here we are. Long Shadow.

388
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,370
你们没有吉普车或摩托车之类的吗
Don't you have a jeep or a motorcycle or something?

389
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,290
那可不太公平  不是吗
That wouldn't be very sporting now, would it?

390
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,850
他会安全带你回来的
He'll bring you home safely.

391
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,510
事先声明  这不是我的主意
For the record, this wasn't my idea.

392
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,550
和哈顿夫人预言的一样  有三组踪迹
Three sets of tracks. Just as Lady Hatton foretold.

393
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,350
我数到四具尸体  虽然是残骸
I count four bodies. Parts of them, anyway.

394
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,620
-他们会回来的  -你为什么这么肯定
- They'll be back. - What makes you so sure?

395
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,480
巨人是不会留下食物的
Giants don't leave food behind.

396
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,320
踪迹向北  朝河的方向去了
The tracks are heading north, toward the river.

397
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,410
我们要在这里战斗
This is where we'll make our stand.

398
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,640
他们会从桥上过河
They'll use the bridge to cross.

399
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,700
我们可以在任意一边的灌木丛中占据位置
We can take up positions in the brush on either side.

400
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,440
嗯  看起来是个偷袭的绝佳地点
Yeah, seems like a perfect spot for an ambush.

401
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,990
我也这么想
My thoughts exactly.

402
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,270
-我们上  -干掉他
- Let's get him! - Take him!

403
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,790
快追
After him!

404
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,050
打倒他
Bring him down!

405
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,910
你真的觉得我们需要你的帮助
Did you really think we needed your help

406
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,450
才能去杀我们猎杀了几个世纪的巨人吗
to kill something we've been hunting for centuries?

407
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,310
我们决不允许魔鬼
We will never allow the devil

408
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,440
坐上英格兰的王座
to sit on the throne of England.

409
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,260
那将引发世界末日
It would usher in the apocalypse.

410
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,100
我必须承认
I must confess

411
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,850
当哈顿夫人第一次告诉我
when Lady Hatton first told me

412
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,030
她对未来的预见和必须做的事的时候
about her vision and what needed to be done

413
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,060
我有些犹豫
I was hesitant.

414
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,210
布鲁姆对你的潜力很有信心
Broom was so certain of your potential

415
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,720
并且你做了很多善事
and you have done so much good.

416
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,840
但是命运是变幻无常的野兽
But fate is a fickle beast.

417
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,780
而现在我必须做
And now I must do

418
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,500
你父亲多年前就该做的事
what your father should have done those many years ago.

419
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,430
不
No.

420
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,170
你的头颅将成为我们陈列室的一大亮点
If it's any consolation, your head will make

421
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,230
也许这能让你略感安慰
a wonderful addition to our gallery.

422
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,820
吉尔
Jill!

423
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,620
你完蛋了
You are going down!

424
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,850
我以为是同一个脚趾
I thought it was the same toe.

425
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,870
你想象不到我杀了多少人才拿到这个
You have no idea how many I had to kill.

426
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,480
我很快就能让你玩上"扭扭乐"
I'll have you playing Twister in no time.

427
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,980
抱歉  玩笑开得太早
Sorry, too soon.

428
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,550
你的努力很快就会得到回报
And soon you shall reap the reward for your efforts.

429
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,070
我不知道你会不会觉得饿
I didn't know if you'd be hungry or what, you know.

430
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,690
要是我在箱子里待一千年  肯定饿疯了
A thousand years in a box and I'd be starving.

431
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,780
你不会相信现在的人都会
You wouldn't believe what people

432
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,220
乱扔些什么东西  饼干
throw away these days. Cookie!

433
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,930
复仇是我唯一需要的食物
Revenge is the only sustenance I require.

434
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,200
看看这个
Look at this.

435
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,520
一个饱受战争和贫穷蹂躏的世界
A world ravaged by war and poverty

436
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,130
被无能的恐惧贩子的领导着
led by feckless fear mongers.

437
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,150
他们用歌唱比赛取代了剑
They've replaced swords with singing competitions.

438
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,300
他们时日无多了
Well, not for much longer.

439
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,350
我的另一条手臂呢
What about my other hand?

440
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,810
你确定能找回来吗
You're certain you can retrieve it?

441
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,230
当然  当然了
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,720
然后你会遵守承诺复原我
And you'll restore me, as you promised?

443
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,330
别担心  你会得到应得的
Don't worry, you'll get what's due.

444
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,150
好事会降临在耐心等待的人身上
All good things come to those who wait.

445
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,320
把最后一个箱子给我  让我再次完整
Bring me the last box. Make me whole again.

446
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,360
然后我们将一起
And together,

447
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,250
用鲜血为这个世界洗礼
we will baptize this world in blood.

448
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,710
真疼  好了
That hurt. Okay.

449
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,710
看看这个
Well, look at that.

450
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,940
看来你们还是需要我的帮助的
I guess you did need my help after all.

451
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,190
等一下
Wait a minute.

452
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,530
我以为有三个巨人
I thought there was supposed to be three.

453
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,620
天哪  明天早上我肯定浑身酸痛
God, I'm gonna feel that in the morning.

454
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,940
到爸爸这儿来
Come to papa.

455
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,050
别动  帅哥
Hold still, handsome!

456
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,660
里面真他妈湿
It's fucking wet in there!

457
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,890
哥们
Pal!

458
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,950
你都吃了什么
What have you been eating?

459
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,610
该死  我忘了
Shit, I forgot.

460
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,420
只剩你和我了  公主
Yeah, it's just you and me now, princess!

461
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,430
是我的滴滴吗
Is that my Uber?

462
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,190
他在那儿
There he is.

463
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,340
-就是他  -带他上车
- That's him. - Let's get him.

464
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,830
欢迎回到人间
Welcome back to the land of the living.

465
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,910
几乎没留下伤痕  你愈合得真快
Hardly a scratch left. You heal fast.

466
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,650
我在哪儿
Where am I?

467
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,280
培根  鸡蛋和血肠  吃吗
Bacon, eggs and black pudding, do ya?

468
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,180
看起来你需要一顿像样的英式早餐
You look like you could use a proper English breakfast.

469
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,460
来吧  在你倒下之前坐下
Go on, sit down before you fall down.

470
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,630
我是怎么来的
How did I get here?

471
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,980
一个人和一辆车
A man with a van.

472
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,060
实际上是四个人
Actually, four men.

473
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,610
顺便说一下  你欠我三百镑
You owe me 300 quid, by the way.

474
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,200
不好意思  我认识你吗
I'm sorry, do I know you?

475
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,490
"提防闪电巨龙  我的孩子"
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!"

476
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,490

478

479
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,620
-"提防啾啾怪鸟"  -"啾啾怪鸟"
- "Beware the Jubjub bird," - "The Jubjub bird..."

480
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,160
-"躲避那狂暴的"  -"狂暴的"
- "and shun the frumious..." - "The frumious..."

481
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,580
"凶恶猛兽"
"Bandersnatch!"

482
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,280
爱丽丝
Alice.

483
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,100
小爱丽丝·莫纳汉
Little Alice Monaghan.

484
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,930
没那么小的爱丽丝·莫纳汉
Not so little Alice Monaghan.

485
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,280
你现在是干这个吗  用茶叶占卜
This is what you do now, huh? You what, you read tea leaves?

486
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,570
给别人算命吗
You, uh, you tell people's fortune?

487
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,610
我是在利用与生俱来的天赋
I make use of the gifts I was given.

488
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,200
是吗  你帮人们和死去的亲戚交流吗
Oh, yeah? You let folks talk to their dead relatives?

489
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,700
怎么收费  五块钱一次吗
For what, like five bucks a pop?

490
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,010
差不多十块吧
More like a tenner.

491
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,960
少撕了一个
Missed one.

492
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,740
糟糕
Bollocks!

493
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,510
你得避开烧焦的部分吃了
You'll have to eat around the burnt bits.

494
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,220
而且算你走运
And lucky for you, too.

如果不是死者帮忙  我根本找不到你
If it weren't for the dead, I never would've found you.

497
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,360
他们一直絮絮叨叨  特别是妈妈和爸爸
They keep blathering on. Especially Mom and Dad.

498
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,600
对了  他们向你问好
They say hi, by the way.

499
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,960
{\an8}爸爸  妈妈

500
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,980
抱歉  我不知道
Sorry. I didn't know.

501
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,090
你怎么可能知道呢
Why would you?

502
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,570
如果你有那么一点点在乎
Maybe if you'd given a flying fig

503
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,580
在过去的二十年里能联系我一次的话
and checked in on me once in the past 20...

504
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,730
什么
What?

505
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,490
不  他没有  我来处理就好
No, he doesn't. Just let me deal with it.

506
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,630
更多死者吗
More dead people?

507
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,160
我跟你说过  他们从不闭嘴
I told you, they never shut up.

508
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,340
他们现在在跟你说什么
What are they telling you now?

509
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,960
他们说我应该抓住机会杀了你
They're saying I should kill you while I have the chance.

510
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,110
你看  他们知道你不知道的事
You see, they know what you don't,

511
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,000
比如桌子下面有一把霰弹枪
that I've got a shotgun under the table

512
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,160
填装了天使之骨的子弹
loaded with angel bones

513
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,270
正瞄准你的裆部
aimed right at your todger.

514
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,640
这年头似乎大家都想要我的命
Seems like everybody wants me dead nowadays.

515
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,350
他们告诉你为什么了吗
They give you a reason?

516
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,830
只说了末日即将降临
Only that the end is coming.

517
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,140
而且让末日降临的人是你
And it'll be you that brings it.

518
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,910
谷歌翻译一下  可以吗
Google-translate that, would you?

519
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,850
只是几句...
It's just something that...

520
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,460
一个朋友告诉我的话
a friend told me, you know.

521
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,510
就像是预言
Like a prophecy.

522
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,770
{\an8}恶魔

523
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,290
你到底开不开枪
You gonna shoot me or what?

524
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,050
死者可能会害怕你这个恶魔
The dead might be afraid of your demon ass,

525
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,560
但我更了解你
but I know you better.

526
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,480
再说  我还欠你一个人情
Besides, I still owe you one

527
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,110
你在我小时候救过我的命
for saving my life when I was just a kid.

528
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,930
那我们到桌子底下干什么
So, what are we doing down here?

529
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,050
躲开玻璃
Avoiding the glass.

530
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,960
武装警察
Armed police!

531
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,040
待在这儿
Stay here!

532
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,810
天啊
Jesus Christ!

533
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,420
我儿子真厉害
That's my boy.

534
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,710
爸
Dad!

535
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,380
你好  儿子
Hello, son.

536
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,300
我只是不明白你为什么这么生我的气
I just don't know why you were so angry with me.

537
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,550
你就不能敲门吗
You couldn't have knocked?

538
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,180
我告诉你了  我们清理完
Well, I told you, after we cleaned up

539
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,110
你和巨人战斗留下的一团糟
the mess you left behind with the giants

540
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,030
你又不在现场  我担心你遭遇了不测
and you weren't there, I feared the worst.

541
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,390
谢天谢地你没事  好吗
Thank God you're all right. Okay?

542
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,710
你知道比背后挨刀更让人受伤的是什么吗
You know what hurts worse than being stabbed in the back?

543
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,680
就是背后挨刀
Being stabbed in the back.

544
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,120
得了吧  你不能相信
Come on. You can't possibly believe

545
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,000
我早知道俄赛里斯会社密谋要暗杀你
that I knew the Osiris Club was plotting to assassinate you.

546
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,560
你知道我不能相信什么吗
You know what I can't believe?

547
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,590
我不能相信你那么多年前为了杀我
I can't believe you showed up on Nazi island

548
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,890
出现在纳粹人的岛上
all those years ago just to kill me.

549
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,610
是的  没错
Yeah, that's right,

550
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,340
我碰见了你的老情人  哈顿夫人
I bumped into your old flame, Lady Hatton.

551
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,410
她给我补充了一些
She, uh, filled me in on a couple of

552
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,010
我们的家庭故事中的遗漏之处
the missing pieces of our family narrative.

553
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,540
如果你想挖我的陈年旧事
Well, if you wanna dig up my sordid skeletons,

554
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,530
我会第一个坦诚相告
I'll be the first to hand you a shovel.

555
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,380
但现在不是时候
But this is not the time,

556
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,890
而且我想介绍你认识一个人  好吗
and there's someone I wanna introduce you to, okay?

557
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,190
本·戴米奥少校  十一军特种部队队长
Major Ben Daimio, head of Special Ops for M-11.

558
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,670
-十一军  -这是我儿子
- M-11? - My son.

559
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,050
我以为你们在战后就解散了
I thought you guys disbanded after the war.

560
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,150
我以为我们应该
And I thought we were supposed to be

561
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,920
打击怪物  而不是与怪物共事
fighting monsters, not working with them.

562
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,070
你管谁叫怪物呢  哥们
Who you calling monster, pal?

563
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,680
你最近照镜子了吗  疤面煞星
You look in the mirror recently, Scarface?

564
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,170
-这是在玩幽默吗  -也许吧
- Is that meant to be humor? - Maybe.

565
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,450
我的心理医生确实说
My therapist does say that

566
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,820
我依靠笑话寻求正常化
I rely on jokes as a way to normalize.

567
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,120
正常化  是的  祝你好运
Normalize, right. Good luck with that.

568
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,870
很高兴见到你们俩相处融洽
So glad to see you two are getting along.

569
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,760
因为是在英国领土  所以这是一次联合行动
Since this is on British soil, it'll be a joint operation.

570
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,520
拜托  我不用任何帮助就能把俄赛里斯会社
Please, I don't need any help kicking the dentures

571
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,210
打得满地找牙好吗  我能行
out of the Osiris Club, all right? I got this.

572
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,740
不  这比你了解的还要严重
No, this is bigger than you know.

573
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,130
圣赛巴斯蒂安修道院遭到袭击
St. Sebastian's has been attacked

574
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,170
一件古物被盗
and a relic was stolen.

575
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,450
据称是妮缪之棺的其中一具
Thought to be one of the Nimue Caskets.

576
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,420
妮什么
Nim-who?

577
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,180
薇薇安·妮缪
Vivienne Nimue.

578
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,180
也被称为血皇后
Also known as the Blood Queen.

579
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,610
公元五世纪的一位永生不死的女巫
An immortal fifth century sorceress.

580
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,240
她的其中一项能力就是
Amongst her powers, she has a plague

581
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,790
差点毁灭英国的瘟疫
that almost wiped Britain off the map.

582
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,490
而这一次可能毁灭全世界
And this time it could be the world.

583
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,020
亚瑟王亲自收拾了那个怪物
King Arthur himself took care of that monster.

584
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,710
他用王者之剑肢解了她
He used Excalibur to dismember her,

585
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,680
然后把尸块锁在了棺材中
then locked the pieces in caskets

586
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,330
并将棺材藏在了全国的各个角落
and hid them throughout the country.

587
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,680
刮目相看  少校
Very impressive, Major.

588
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,830
俄赛里斯会社在三十年代发现了其中一具
The Osiris Club discovered one in the '30s

589
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,610
把它作为他们的永久收藏
and kept it as part of their permanent collection.

590
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,550
好极了  那我们回俄赛里斯会社
Great. So we go back to the Osiris Club,

591
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,700
找到这个棺材
we find this casket,

592
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,850
搞清楚到底是谁想把血皇后的碎尸
we figure out whoever's trying to Humpty Dumpty

593
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,220
重新拼起来
this Blood Queen back together

594
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,990
顺便对会社进行报复
and we get a little payback while we're at it.

595
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,720
报复  这不是为了复仇
Payback? This isn't about revenge.

596
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,790
对我来说就是
For me, it is.

597
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,930
一旦棺材安全了
Once the casket is secure,

598
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,920
你就要乘第一班飞机离开
you'll be on the first flight out.

599
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,000
防御局可以把你关回你的回笼子里
The Bureau can put you back in your cage.

600
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,000
我的笼子  我的笼子
My cage? My cage!

601
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,080
我会特别要求你来打扫我的锯角屑
I'm gonna ask specifically that you clean my sawdust.

602
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,230
等不及看你闻恶魔的屎了  哥们
Can't wait till you smell demon shit, pal!

603
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,840
他们告诉我你是负责人
They tell me you're the man in charge.

604
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,370
-这是什么  -索赔你们造成的破坏
- What's this? - A bill for damages.

605
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,990
{\an8}破坏索赔
一百万英镑

606
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,670
一百万英镑  就为几扇打破的窗户
A million pounds? For a few broken windows?

607
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,730
你得考虑到造成的情感创伤
You've gotta factor in the emotional trauma.

608
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,930
不好意思  你是谁来着
I'm sorry, who are you again?

609
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,800
我是救了地狱男爵的女孩  你又是谁
I'm the girl who saved Hellboy. Who the hell are you?

610
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,260
是啊  对了  我想谢谢你救我
Yeah, I wanted to thank you for that, by the way.

611
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,520
所以她是你的保镖吗
So, she's what, your bodyguard?

612
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,880
说得没错  我们出发吧
Fucking right I am. So let's go.

613
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,730
这是军事行动  不是狂欢节的助兴节目
This is a military operation! Not a carnival sideshow.

614
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,390
爱丽丝是我唯一信任的人  好吗
Alice is the only person that I trust, all right?

615
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,450
所以如果你想让我去
So, you want me,

616
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,700
她就得跟着一起
she comes with.

617
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,740
给
Here.

618
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,240
你的新玩具
Your new toy.

619
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,500
做你该做的事
Do what you have to do.

620
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,920
我要回总部
I'm going back to HQ

621
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,950
想办法定位血皇后的其余尸块
and try to locate the rest of the Blood Queen.

622
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,920
祝你们好运
Good luck, hmm?

623
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,870
教授  这女孩怎么办
Professor. What about the girl?

624
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,550
爱丽丝  她是个强大的灵媒
Alice? She's a powerful spirit medium.

625
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,940
带上她一起  我们需要所有的帮手
Take her with you. We need all the help we can get.

626
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,320
好了  这里完事了  我们出发
All right, we're done here! Let's move it out!

627
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,620
你不打算打开看看吗
Well, aren't you gonna open it?

628
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,570
厉害了
That's mega.

629
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,040
他大概是在过度补偿
He's probably overcompensating

630
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,760
因为他不是我亲爸
'cause he's not my real dad.

631
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,470
这个礼物不得了
That's some present.

632
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,230
有些爸爸给孩子买乐高
Some dads get their kids LEGOs.

633
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,200
怎么了
What's wrong?

634
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,510
怎么了
What's wrong?

635
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,630
通灵偏头痛
Psychic migraine.

636
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,620
就像是我大脑里发生了车祸
It's like a car crash in my head.

637
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,640
这里发生了可怕的事
Something terrible happened here.

638
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,660
待在这里  不要动
Stay here. Don't move.

639
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,880
天啊
Oh, God.

640
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,620
-停  按我的指令行动  -什么
- Hold. Move on my command. - What?

641
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,130
我们能进去了吗
Can we go in now?

642
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,230
天啊  救救他  你们没听见他在尖叫吗
For fuck's sake, help him! Can't you hear him screaming?

643
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,240
爱丽丝
Alice.

644
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,320
那是什么声音
What is that sound?

645
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,230
是哈顿夫人
It's Lady Hatton.

646
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,430
你之前告诉我们的那个灵媒
The psychic you were telling us about?

647
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,870
显然  她这个灵媒不够灵
Clearly, she wasn't psychic enough.

648
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,520
爱丽丝  有什么感应吗
Alice, picking up anything?

649
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,330
她的灵魂还在这里
Her spirit's still with us.

650
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,250
你能和她交流吗
You think you can make contact?

651
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,420
搞清楚这里发生了什么
Figure out what the hell happened here?

652
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,120
也许你应该离开  少校
You might wanna leave, Major.

653
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,140
这种事可算不上愉快
This kind of thing isn't pretty.

654
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,950
错过所有的乐趣吗  绝对不可能
And miss all the fun? Not a chance.

655
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,100
哈顿夫人  你能听到我的声音吗
Lady Hatton, can you hear me?

656
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,190
哈顿夫人
Lady Hatton...

657
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,910
见鬼了
Well, I'll be fucked.

658
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,620
妮缪  她回来了
Nimue, she has returned.

659
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,830
嗯  这个我们知道
Yeah, we know that.

660
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,630
这就是俄赛里斯会社想杀我的原因吗
Is that why Osiris tried to kill me?

661
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,970
人类会堕入她的黑暗
Man will fall to her darkness.

662
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,230
黑暗的子民
Those who call the shadows home

663
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,690
将再度崛起
will rise again.

664
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,580
好吧
Okay.

665
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,170
我想要更具体更切实的预言
I'd appreciate a prophecy with smaller and more relatable stakes.

666
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,690
绝不能让皇后找到国王
The Queen must never find a king!

667
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,880
当妮缪再次完整之时
When Nimue is whole again,

668
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,260
你真正的命运就将揭晓
then your true destiny will be revealed.

669
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,370
这是我所见到的  只有到那时...
This I have seen. Only then will...

670
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,050
只有到那时会怎样
Only then will what?

671
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,020
你正说到精彩的部分
You're just getting to the good part!

672
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,320
它还在这里
It's... It's still here!

673
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,980
-你还好吗  -不好
- Are you all right? - No.

674
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,690
一个女人刚从我嘴里钻出来了
A lady just came out of my fucking mouth!

675
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,250
你陪着她
Stay with her.

676
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,810
操
Fuck!

677
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,050
我认识你
I know you.

678
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,410
那是条胳膊吗
Is that an arm?

679
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,580
快他妈放开我
Fucking let me go!

680
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,190
恶心死了
That's disgusting!

681
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,320
你妈难道没教过你
Didn't your mother ever tell you

682
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,150
不要跟死物打交道吗
you shouldn't play with dead things!

683
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,310
皇后陛下  救救我  我还没准备好
My Queen, help me! I'm not ready yet!

684
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,530
皇后陛下
My Queen!

685
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,490
真迷人
Fascinating.

686
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,860
我从没见过像你这样的生物
Never have I seen a creature quite like you.

687
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,620
妮缪
Nimue.

688
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,400
如此强大的力量  如此辉煌的潜力
Such power, such glorious potential.

689
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,720
我们没有理由成为敌人
There is no reason for us to be enemies,

690
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,200
我们可以一起
when we can be

691
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,080
成就更多
so much more.

692
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,670
他们害怕我们  他们称我们为怪物
They fear us. They call us monsters.

693
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,560
我们渴望着同一天
We yearn for the same day,

694
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,220
那一天我们不再被辱骂  而是被称颂为英雄
when we are not reviled but lauded as heroes.

695
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,960
一粒粒种子
Seed by seed,

696
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,770
一棵棵树木  一块块石头
tree by tree, stone by stone,

697
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,840
我们将一起重新种植伊甸园
we'll replant Eden together.

698
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,740
接下来会发生什么
What happens next,

699
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,850
只有命运才能决定
only the fates decide.

700
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,390
地狱男爵
Hellboy!

701
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,400
你他妈的混账
You fucking prick!

702
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,820
没打中  不是吗
I missed, didn't I?

703
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,240
告诉我你抓住那个混蛋了
Tell me you got the bastard.

704
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,300
我们追了  那个该死的跑得太快了
We pursued. The damn thing was just too fast.

705
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,030
我们连它的真面目都没看清
We didn't even get a proper look at it.

706
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,950
那个丑陋的猪脸贱货
That ugly pig-faced son of a bitch.

707
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,580
但是你看到了  对不对
But you did, didn't you?

708
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,460
你知道这是怎么回事
You know what's going on here,

709
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,230
所以我强烈建议你现在就交待
so I strongly suggest you start talking.

710
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,850
是棕精灵
It was the Gruagach.

711
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,150
-什么  -你确定吗
- The what? - Are you sure?

712
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,700
嗯  我绝不会忘记那么一张脸
Yeah. I'd never forget a face like that.

713
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,190
棕精灵是什么
What's a Gruagach?

714
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,120
我们多年前曾经有一面之缘
We first crossed paths years ago.

715
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,780
爱丽丝当时还是个婴儿
Alice was just a baby at the time,

716
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,640
而精灵喜欢偷婴儿
and fairies loved to steal babies.

717
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,780
我们简直像是活在一个
It's like living in a nightmare

718
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,090
永远醒不来的噩梦里
we can't wake up from.

719
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,960
天知道为什么
Who knows why,

720
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,700
但是当他们设法偷到一个孩子后
but when they do manage to get their hands on one,

721
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,410
他们会留下一个换生灵来冒充人类
they leave a changeling in its place to pass for human.

722
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,910
她看上去是一样的  但是
She looks the same, but...

723
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,310
我解释不了
I can't explain it.

724
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,090
这不是我的女儿
That's not my daughter.

725
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,120
看看你
Look at you.

726
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,300
爱丽丝  你真是最可爱的小宝贝
Alice, aren't you the cutest little baby?

727
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,050
你的妈妈和爸爸...
Your mom and your dad are, uh,

728
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,560
担心你最近举止有点奇怪
well, worried that you've been acting strange.

729
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,840
没关系  地狱男爵叔叔来了
It's okay. Uncle Hellboy is here.

730
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,450
他正好有个绝招
And he's got just the thing for that.

731
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,980
嗯  我也是这么想的  你这个小混蛋
Yeah, that's what I thought, you little bastard!

732
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,630
天哪  你在做什么
Jesus! What are you doing?

733
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,570
铁  他们讨厌铁
Iron. They hate the stuff.

734
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,090
放开我
Let me go!

735
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,460
放开我  这是虐待儿童
Let me go! Ahh! This is child abuse!

736
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,050
我是个小宝宝  你这大个子混账
I'm a little baby, you big fuck!

737
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,340
真恶心  那是什么
It's disgusting! What is that thing?

738
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,330
抓不到
Didn't get!

739
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,750
滚开
Fuck off!

740
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,870
疼  疼  我保证  我保证
It hurts! It hurts! I promise! I promise!

741
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,290
精灵会把她送回来的
The fairies will return her!

742
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,830
我发誓  快他妈放开我
I swear! Just fucking let me go!

743
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,910
我也想相信你的话
Yeah, I'd love to take your word for it.

744
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,240
但你知道吗
But you know what?

745
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,320
有个问题  那就是我不傻
There's one problem, I'm just not stupid!

746
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,210
傻逼
Twat!

747
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,470
你这个狡诈的小混蛋
You slippery little bastard!

748
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,140
听着
Listen!

749
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,650
你最好赶紧把他们的孩子送回来
You better bring these people back their baby

750
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,680
否则我就亲自去接她
or I'm coming to get her myself!

751
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,850
然后你和你的精灵小伙伴
And then you and your fairy friends

752
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,490
就有得后悔了
are gonna be sorry!

753
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,920
{\an8}爱丽丝镜中世界奇遇记
刘易斯·卡罗尔

754
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,210
总算来了
About goddamn time.

755
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,390
爱丽丝
Alice!

756
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,080
天哪  她回来了
Oh, my God. She's back.

757
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,310
最好是新换的尿布
This better be a clean diaper,

758
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,140
否则我会去找你的
or I'm coming after you!

759
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,950
小爱丽丝
Wee Alice.

760
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,970
我不可能永远躲着他
Guess I couldn't avoid him forever.

761
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,310
命运总是有办法
Destiny always has a way

762
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,930
让事情回到原点
of bringing things full circle.

763
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,280
命运
Destiny.

764
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,320
只不过是"巧合"的愚蠢解释
Stupid word for "coincidence."

765
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,810
别说命运的坏话  她是个有仇必报的贱人
Don't talk shit about fate. She's a vindictive bitch.

766
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,710
我们背负着我们血统中的每一个罪恶
We carry every sin committed in our bloodlines.

767
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,430
血皇后也是这么说的
Blood Queen said pretty much the same thing.

768
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,550
这一切是为了什么
So, that's what this is all about?

769
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,220
你之前惹过什么精灵之类的蠢货
Some fairy tale wanker you pissed off

770
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,720
要来找你寻仇了
is now looking for revenge?

771
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,700
而且他正在利用血皇后来达成目的
And he's now using the Blood Queen to get it.

772
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,440
我说不好  或许是她在利用他
I don't know about that. Maybe she's using him.

773
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,440
怎么说
And how's that?

774
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,710
那个叫亚瑟的
This Arthur comes along,

775
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,290
把她砍碎了
chops her up into little pieces,

776
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,820
装在箱子里埋了
buries her in boxes?

777
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,730
也许她只是想让怪物们走出阴影
Maybe she just wants monsters to come out

778
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,660
重新生活呢
from the shadows and live again.

779
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,530
棒极了  这样她就又有灭绝人类的机会了
Great, so she gets another shot at wiping out mankind.

780
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,510
我们不了解她  至少不确定
We don't know that about her. Not for sure.

781
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,770
集合我们的人  我要带他们回伦敦总部
Collect our men. I'm taking them back to London HQ.

782
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:26,320
夜晚  秘密的忠实守护者
O night, faithful preserver of mysteries.

783
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,420
还有明亮的星辰与月亮
And ye bright stars and moon.

784
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,350
继承了仇恨之日的火焰
Succeed the fires of hateful day.

785
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,690
小心点  你们这些渣滓
Careful, you slags!

786
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,490
比起1500年来
The pain is fleeting

787
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,700
被囚于箱子的折磨  这痛苦不算什么
compared to 1,500 years locked in a box.

788
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,170
我活着只是为了服侍您  皇后陛下
I only live to serve, my Queen.

789
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,020
你服侍我的唯一目的就是
You only serve to get your revenge

790
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,660
向地狱男爵复仇
against this Hellboy.

791
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,290
他对你来说为何如此重要
Why is he so important to you?

792
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,260
他用铁烙伤我
He burnt me with iron

793
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,730
诅咒我永世蒙受耻辱
and cursed me to a world of shame.

794
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,510
我本来可以做个人的
I could've been a person.

795
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,120
而不是这种可悲徘徊的东西
Not this wasted, wandering thing.

796
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,870
我本来可以享受真正的生活
I could've had a real life,

797
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,250
充满了光明和幸福
filled with light and happiness.

798
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,680
地狱男爵剥夺了这个权力
Hellboy stole that from me.

799
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,750
可怜的东西
Poor creature.

800
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,400
复仇的欲望令我们被愤怒蒙蔽了双眼
Lust for vengeance has made us both blind with rage.

801
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,720
妮缪  女巫皇后
Nimue, Queen of Witches.

802
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,430
妮缪还活着
Nimue who lives.

803
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,560
妮缪永生不死
Nimue, who can never die.

804
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,700
但现在
But now,

805
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,360
我看到面前出现了一条新的道路
I see a new path laid out before me,

806
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,530
一条通向更大荣耀的道路
one that would lead to far greater glory.

807
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:01,610
-你的地狱男爵是关键  -地狱男爵  但是...
- And your Hellboy is the key. - Hellboy? But...

808
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,890
我们这是要做什么  我不明白
Where are we going with this? I don't... I don't understand.

809
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,080
你会明白的
You will.

810
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,640
但首先
But first,

811
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,620
我们必须完成一个最终任务
we must complete one final task.

812
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,410
-炸鱼薯条店  -我们到了
- Fish 'n chips shop? - We're here.

813
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,660
{\an8}鳕鱼冲击
炸鱼薯条

814
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,640
就是这里吗
This is it?

815
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,060
你指望会有个标志写着"秘密总部"吗
Were you expecting a sign that says "Secret Headquarters"?

816
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,190
来吧
Come on.

817
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,940
哈克夫人
Mrs. Harker.

818
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,840
你好
Hello.

819
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,910
我还以为外面就够难闻了呢
I thought it smelled bad on the outside.

820
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,130
接下来交给你们两个吧  我要走了
I'll let you two take it from here. I'm leaving.

821
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,120
而你  哪也不许去
And you, don't go anywhere.

822
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,130
我最不需要的就是一个怪人
Last thing I need is some freak

823
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,300
在附近闲晃吓到当地人
wandering around scaring the locals.

824
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,600
他要去哪儿
Where's he going?

825
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,680
我们不是要拯救世界吗
Haven't we got to be saving the world or something?

826
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:58,890
他是个混蛋
He's an asshole.

827
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,830
喂
Oi.

828
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,670
我要看证件  亲爱的
I need some ID, love.

829
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,080
你认真的吗
Are you serious?

830
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,160
恐怕规矩就是规矩
Rules are rules, I'm afraid.

831
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,430
现在炼狱和地狱我都去过了
Now I've been to purgatory and hell.

832
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,650
这是个老防空洞
It was an old bomb shelter

833
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,540
战后重新翻修的
that was refurbished after the war.

834
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,830
翻修  你管这个叫翻修吗
Refurbished? You call this refurbished?

835
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,410
太好了  你来了
Good, you're here!

836
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,960
这是我们目前掌握的有关妮缪的信息
This is all we got on Nimue so far.

837
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,210
我们没事  感谢你的关心
We're fine. Thank you for asking.

838
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,250
你在俄赛里斯会社的朋友可就不太好了
Your friends at Osiris, not so much.

839
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,740
每个故事都不一样
No two stories are alike,

840
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,570
但一切似乎都表明
but everything seems to suggest

841
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,240
除非她完全复原
she won't get her full powers

842
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,610
否则她无法获得全部的力量
until she's completely restored.

843
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:47,520
你听见了吗  你的朋友都死了
Did you hear me? All your friends are dead!

844
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,000
如果我们不找到她
And there'll be a lot more dead

845
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,610
还会有更多人死去
if we don't find her.

846
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,320
所以或许你们俩可以看看书
So perhaps you two would like to grab a book,

847
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,410
做点研究
do some research,

848
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,560
想办法找出她在哪里
maybe find out where she is,

849
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,870
这样我们就能在她灭了我们之前灭了她
so we can bury her before she buries us.

850
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,010
真好  有作业
Great. Homework.

851
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,450
怪不得戴米奥溜了
No wonder Daimio took off.

852
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,790
{\an8}枪炮匠

853
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,910
戴米奥探员  十一军  货备好了吗
Agent Daimio, M-11. Is the package ready?

854
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,410
快好了  长官
Sir, almost.

855
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,880
你确定这能管用吗
You're sure this is going to work?

856
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,740
已经有很多人试过杀他了
A lot of people have tried to kill him already.

857
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,680
他们没用过这样的东西
Not with something like this they didn't.

858
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,690
这是用犹大的银币
It's cast from Judas Silver

859
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,420
混合圣多米尼克的血
mixed with the blood of Saint Dominic,

860
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,530
并受过圣父祝福的武器
blessed by the Holy Father himself.

861
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,440
我向你保证  一定管用
It will work, I assure you.

862
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,610
假设你真的用得上
Assuming you've actually got to use it.

863
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,470
我是说  谁能说这家伙不诚实呢
I mean, who's to say this bloke's not on the level?

864
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,290
你知道我当兵前是做什么的吗
Do you know what I did before joining the service?

865
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,820
保险精算师
I was an actuary.

866
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,150
我根据一系列
I assessed risk

867
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,930
复杂的数学方程式来评估风险
based on a series of complex mathematical equations.

868
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,210
你看  人会说谎  但数字不会
You see, people lie, but numbers don't.

869
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,130
在我看来  地狱男爵有所隐瞒
And from where I stand, Hellboy doesn't add up.

870
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,460
他体内的怪物是无法否认的
The monster inside him cannot be denied.

871
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,860
不是针对个人  只是数学而已
It's not personal, it's just maths.

872
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,790
所以没错  不能让他活下去
So, yeah, can't see letting him live.

873
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,150
确保一击致命  要么心脏要么大脑
Make sure it's a kill shot. Either the heart or the brain.

874
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,690
那就心脏吧
The heart it is.

875
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,030
地狱男爵的大脑太小难以瞄准
Hellboy's brain is too small a target.

876
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,790
这本书上怎么这么多字
Why does this book have so many words?

877
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,260
假设我们找到妮缪了  假设找到她了
Let's say we find Nimue, huh? Let's say we find her.

878
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,700
然后呢
Then what?

879
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,040
你要用正义的愤怒和强力的拳头
Well, with a righteous fury and a mighty fist,

880
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,620
将她打倒
you'll smite her down.

881
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,960
好了  拜托  地狱男爵
Now, come on, Hellboy,

882
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,370
把你的脚从丘吉尔的桌子上拿下来  好吗
take your feet off Churchill's desk, will you?

883
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,100
{\an8}温斯顿·丘吉尔爵士

884
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,000
牛逼
Wicked.

885
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,060
然后呢
Then what?

886
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,770
然后确保她死透  不会卷土重来
Then we make sure she doesn't come back for the sequel.

887
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,100
然后呢
Then what?

888
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,450
然后世界会照常运转
Then the world will keep on spinning

889
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,130
我们就可以再喝杯茶了
and we'll have another cup of tea.

890
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,680
然后...
And then...

891
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,370
呢
what?

892
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,360
你到底在说什么
What are you on about?

893
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,820
回答问题就行了
Just answer the question.

894
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,180
然后呢
And then what?

895
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,910
我们去找下一个敌人  这是我们的工作
Well, we fight our next foe. It's what we do.

896
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,810
-然后呢  -各位
- And then what? - Guys.

897
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,560
然后...呢
And then... what?

898
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,060
你有话要说  就说出来
You have something to say, say it.

899
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,310
你的道德高地是建立在一堆狗屎上的
Your moral high ground is founded on a pile of bullshit.

900
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,560
这里是超自然调查防御局
This is the B.P.R.D.

901
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,010
我们是沙子上的线[底线]We're the line in the sand.

902
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,780
沙子就是这样的
That's the thing about sand,

903
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,260
你可以再画一条线
you can always draw another line.

904
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,560
-各位  -要不是有我们
- Guys! - If we weren't here,

905
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,070
这里早就变成撒旦的度假屋了
this would be Satan's holiday home.

906
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:28,260
要是人类不那么热衷于
You know, maybe if humans weren't so keen

907
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,820
杀女巫和恶魔之类的
on killing witches and demons and such,

908
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,210
女巫和魔鬼之类的
the witches and demons and such

909
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:35,350
就不会那么热衷于杀人类
wouldn't be so keen on killing humans.

910
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,200
这是胡搅蛮缠  你心知肚明
That's a false equivalence and you know it.

911
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,020
肯定还有别的办法
There's gotta be another way.

912
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,030
我们面临的每一个威胁的答案
The answer to every threat we face

913
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,990
不可能是消灭
cannot be annihilation.

914
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,490
肯定存在一个怪物
There's gotta be a world where monsters

915
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,300
不用躲在阴影里的世界
don't have to hide in the shadows,

916
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:50,940
他们不必生活在恐惧之中  怪物可以...
where they don't have to live in fear. Where monsters...

917
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,680
她影响到你了吗  妮缪
Has she got to you? Nimue,

918
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,210
她用花言巧语和挺拔的胸部
she got to you with her perfumed words

919
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,410
打动你了吗
and her perky breasts?

920
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,240
太蠢了
So stupid!

921
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,740
我不是在说她
I'm not even talking about her!

922
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,020
那你是在说谁
Then who?

923
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,300
我们面临世上所有的神秘和超自然威胁
We face every mystical and metaphysical threat there is,

924
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,690
但你还是收养了我  为什么
and yet you take me in. Why?

925
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,140
你是被派去杀我的
You were sent to kill me.

926
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,870
是什么改变了你的想法
What changed your mind?

927
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,320
你
You did.

928
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,770
十岁生日你送了我一把枪
You gave me a gun on my tenth birthday!

929
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,500
你派我去威尔顿根森林
You sent me into the Wildungen forest

930
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:27,350
狩猎一群野山巨怪
to hunt a pack of wild hill trolls!

931
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,870
又来了
Here we go again.

932
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:32,560
对  我们没玩过蛇梯棋
No, we didn't play Snakes and Ladders.

933
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,040
我们没玩过钓鱼游戏
We didn't play Go Fish.

934
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,910
我没教过你踢足球或打棒球
I didn't coach you in football or baseball.

935
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:38,820
你把我变成了该死的武器
You made me a goddamn weapon.

936
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:42,930
我只是想帮助你成为最好的你
I just wanted to help you become the best you.

937
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,770
如果你真的爱我
If you, uh, loved me,

938
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,010
也许你早该和你那些想置我于死地的
maybe you could talk to some of your human friends

939
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,910
人类朋友谈谈
that would want to see me dead,

940
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,280
而不是让我去
rather than unleashing me

941
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,720
屠杀我的兄弟姐妹
to slaughter my brothers and sisters!

942
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,750
干嘛
What?

943
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,000
教养有方
Just solid parenting.

944
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,050
该死的人类
Goddamn humans.

945
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,400
上楼
Going up.

946
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,060
下楼
Going down.

947
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,420
我按的上楼
I pushed up!

948
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,040
下楼
Going down.

949
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,260
-上楼  -下楼
- Up! - Going down.

950
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,500
搞什么
What the fuck?

951
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,020
-上楼  上楼  上楼  -下楼  下楼  下楼
- Up! Up! Up! Up! - Down. Down. Down. Down.

952
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,280
下楼  下楼  下楼
Down. Down. Down.

953
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,010
下楼
Going down.

954
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,660
地下一层
Lower ground.

955
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,160
雅佳婆婆
Baba Yaga.

956
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,310
婆婆  雅佳婆婆
Baba? Baba Yaga!

957
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,300
省省吧
Cut the crap.

958
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,620
我知道你在
I know you're here.

959
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,180
你为什么召唤我
Why'd you summon me?

960
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,760
你想玩游戏是吧
You wanna play games, huh?

961
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,440
这样吧  我们来玩骰子游戏
Tell you what, let's break out the Yahtzee.

962
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,350
其它的我不感兴趣
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

963
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,730
我感受到了你的饥饿
I felt your hunger,

964
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:03,740
我为你准备了盛宴
and I have prepared a feast for you.

965
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,060
你可真漂亮
Don't you look lovely.

966
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:48,890
大多数人认为我丑陋无比  独眼的老巫婆
Most think me grotesque. An old hag with one eye.

967
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,680
不  我不这么认为
No, not me.

968
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,430
因为是你让我变成这样的
Probably because you did this to me!

969
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,460
我记得你试图把斯大林的
I recall you trying to raise

970
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,850
鬼魂从墓地里召唤出来
Stalin's ghost from the Necropolis.

971
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:05,130
我总得做点什么来阻止你
I had to do something to stop you.

972
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,720
所以你打瞎我的眼睛
So you shot out my eye

973
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,440
把我关进这个监狱
and put me in this prison.

974
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:17,660
我觉得把你放逐到邻近的空间
You know, I thought that banishing you to an adjacent dimension was,

975
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,780
挺聪明的
kinda clever.

976
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:25,120
过来  坐下
Come. Sit.

977
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,190
吃吧
Eat.

978
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,690
对两个人来说  真是桌宴席
Yeah. Quite a spread for just two people.

979
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,950
我们庆祝她的归来
We celebrate her return.

980
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,300
妮缪
Nimue?

981
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,290
你为她的正义喝彩是正确的
You are correct to applaud her righteousness.

982
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,840
在她的世界里  你会被奉为英雄
In her world, you will be hailed a hero!

983
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:53,760
他们会为你建造两千英尺高的雕像
They will build statues of you, 2,000 feet high!

984
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,770
用你敌人的骨头打造而成
Made from the bones of your enemies.

985
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,910
那需要一大堆骨头
That'd take a shit-ton of bones.

986
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,920
晚餐吃什么
What is for dinner?

987
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,890
这是个小孩吗
Is that a child?

988
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:16,930
人类的小孩而已
It's just a human child.

989
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:39,040
吃吧
Eat.

990
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,800
天哪
Oh, God!

991
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,620
笨手笨脚  不好意思  我得走了
So clumsy. Sorry about that. I gotta go.

992
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,640
得去复活现场
Gotta be there for that resurrection.

993
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,980
肯定比披头士还带劲
Gonna be better than The Beatles!

994
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,610
我可以帮你
I can help you.

995
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,880
你可以  不是吗
You can, can't you?

996
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,570
你知道妮缪在哪儿  不是吗
You know where Nimue is, don't you?

997
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,620
多漂亮的眼睛
Such nice eyes.

998
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,100
跟尿一样黄
Yellow as piss.

999
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,380
我最爱的颜色
My favorite color.

1000
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,610
我想要一个来代替你从我这夺走的眼睛
I want one to replace what you took from me.

1001
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,140
那是不可能的  姐妹
That's not gonna happen, sister.

1002
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,720
你的时间不多了  恶魔
Your time is running out, demon.

1003
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,680
一旦妮缪完成复活
Once Nimue's resurrection is complete,

1004
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,740
她的瘟疫会剥去人们身体上的肉
her plague will strip the flesh from bodies.

1005
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,240
好吧  行  给你
All right, fine, take it.

1006
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,890
先告诉我去哪找妮缪
Just tell me where to find Nimue first.

1007
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:37,150
这是一项神圣的交易
This is a sacred bargain.

1008
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,550
一旦达成  就不能打破
Once made, it cannot be broken.

1009
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,500
怎么  你想要书面的吗
What, do you want it in writing?

1010
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,350
不需要
No need.

1011
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,360
我们用吻达成交易
Let's seal it with a kiss.

1012
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,010
你的舌头上怎么有毛
How do you have hair on your tongue?

1013
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,200
去彭德尔山
Go to Pendle Hill.

1014
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,620
她需要回收她的血液
She will need to reclaim her blood

1015
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,470
才能恢复她的力量
in order to restore her power.

1016
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:12,550
你必须在午夜前赶到
You only have until midnight.

1017
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,510
哪一只好呢  右眼
Which shall it be, the right

1018
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,230
还是左眼
or the left?

1019
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,960
好了  这会非常疼
Now, this will hurt a lot.

1020
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,790
-你发过誓的  -你会得到你的眼睛
- You swore! - You'll get your eye.

1021
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,130
等我用完就给你
Soon as I'm done with it.

1022
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,710
我们没明确时间范围
We never specified a time frame.

1023
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,930
应该说得更具体些的
Should've been more specific.

1024
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,330
你一直在吃小孩
You've been eating children!

1025
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,530
[咒语]

1026
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,900
滚  带走你的眼睛
Go! Take your eyes

1027
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,190
继续用一段时间
and have them for a while.

1028
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,090
但是你骗我  我要诅咒你
But cheat me and here's my curse,

1029
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,930
你有两只眼睛
that you have two eyes

1030
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,130
用来看你在这世上最爱的东西
to see the thing you love most in the world

1031
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,790
痛苦地死去
suffer and die!

1032
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,650
你是不打算用门了吗
So, are you just not using doors anymore?

1033
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:36,940
别吊我们胃口
Don't keep us in suspense.

1034
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,150
我刚刚去见雅佳婆婆了
I just had a visit from Baba Yaga.

1035
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:43,770
血皇后在彭德尔山
The Blood Queen's in Pendle Hill.

1036
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,170
我们时间紧迫
We're on a clock!

1037
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,340
很高兴看到你理顺了轻重缓急
Glad to see you've straightened your priorities out.

1038
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,380
我不听你的命令  老头
I'm not taking orders from you, old man!

1039
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:01,090
我只是在沙子上画我自己的线
I'm just drawing my own line in the sand!

1040
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,430
谁来帮我拿个薄荷糖
Somebody, please, get me a mint!

1041
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,760
好久不见  老朋友
It has been a long time, old friend.

1042
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,940
太变态了
This is sick.

1043
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,130
你知道他们在彭德尔山对那些女巫做了什么吗
Do you know what they did to the witches at Pendle Hill?

1044
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:41,080
他们割掉她们的舌头  拿去喂蛆
They cut off their tongues, fed them to maggots

1045
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,810
然后当场把她们活埋了
and buried them alive right there on the spot.

1046
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:50,220
不要相信你在网上看到的一切
Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

1047
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,730
我说错什么了吗
What did I say?

1048
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,780
清除世界上的邪恶是脏活
Ridding the world of evil is a dirty business.

1049
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,150
你和怪物到底有什么渊源
What's with you and monsters, anyway?

1050
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,130
小时候有怪物非礼过你吗
One of them touch you funny as a kid?

1051
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,970
我这辈子见过太多变态的事情了
I've been seeing freaky shit my whole life,

1052
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,740
如果说教会了我什么的话
and if it's taught me anything,

1053
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,110
那就是仇恨隐藏在最正直的面孔之后
it's that hate hides behind the most righteous faces.

1054
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:12,240
你真的要跟我讲面孔的事情吗
Are you seriously gonna lecture me about faces?

1055
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,100
也许你认为这些伤疤是我刮胡子弄出来的
Maybe you think I got these scars from shaving.

1056
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,060
发生了什么  我会一直问下去的
What happened? I'm not gonna stop asking.

1057
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,580
还不如直接告诉我
You might as well tell me.

1058
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,490
那时我的部队在伯利兹进行训练演习
My unit was on a training exercise in Belize.

1059
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:33,960
当地的一个部落长老来找我们求助
One of the local tribal elders came to us asking for help.

1060
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,430
他们的村庄遭到一个食人兽的袭击
Their village was under attack by a man-eater.

1061
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:41,980
它会在晚上出现  抓走它的猎物
It would come at night, carry off its prey.

1062
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:46,650
主要是男人  但有时是妇女和儿童
Mostly men, but sometimes it was women and children, too.

1063
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,950
野蛮  聪明
Savage. Smart.

1064
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,820
毫无悔意
Totally without remorse.

1065
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,780
在我们狩猎它的过程中
All the while that we were hunting it,

1066
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,100
实际上是它在狩猎我们
in reality, it was hunting us.

1067
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,310
我是唯一的幸存者
I was the only survivor.

1068
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,820
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,180
我们接近目标了
We're coming up on target.

1070
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,200
我们不可能在那座山上着陆
There's no way we can land on that hill.

1071
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,080
我会尽可能靠近
I'll get us up as close as I can.

1072
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,320
皇后  给您
Here you go, Queen.

1073
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,960
您很快就会恢复成原来的自己
You'll be back to feeling your amazing old self in no time.

1074
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,850
我的生命之血支撑着你
My life blood sustains you...

1075
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:43,810
但现在我必须取回属于我的东西
But now I must reclaim what is mine.

1076
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,470
其他人马上就到了
The others will be here soon.

1077
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,550
那地狱男爵呢
What about Hellboy?

1078
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:54,460
如果他来了  我准备了一个小惊喜
If he comes, I have a little surprise in store.

1079
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,960
快点  快到午夜了
Come on, it's almost midnight!

1080
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,210
时间不多了
Time's running out.

1081
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,620
等等  等一下
Wait! Wait! Just wait!

1082
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,540
我不是恶魔也不是士兵  我他妈累死了
I'm not a demon or a soldier. I'm fucking knackered.

1083
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:11,200
-稍微休息一下  -好吧
- Just give us a sec. - All right.

1084
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,020
我来帮你...
Let me give you...

1085
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,700
一把
a hand!

1086
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,770
这个国家的死人就不能老实待在地下吗
Won't anything in this country stay buried!

1087
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:33,710
现在不行
Not now!

1088
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:17,130
地狱男爵  快到午夜了
Hellboy! It's almost midnight.

1089
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,020
去找血皇后  这里交给我们
Go find the Blood Queen. We can handle this.

1090
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,860
如果你不阻止她  她就会释放瘟疫
She'll spread her plague if you don't stop her!

1091
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,380
没时间了  快去
There's no time! Go!

1092
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,420
爱丽丝  我不会离开你的
Alice, I'm not leaving you.

1093
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,930
快去  阻止妮缪
Go! Stop Nimue!

1094
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,350
我没子弹了  躲在我身后
I'm out. Stay behind me!

1095
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,390
我他妈还能去哪儿
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?

1096
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,990
好球
Goal!

1097
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,500
[咒语]

1098
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,020
终于
At last...

1099
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,960
我重生了
I am reborn.

1100
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,730
是的  您气色不错  陛下
Yeah, you're looking good, Your Majesty.

1101
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,870
她是城堡的皇后
She's the queen of the castle.

1102
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:00,200
他们来了  皇后陛下
They're here, my Queen.

1103
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,910
他们从黑暗中出来
They've come from out of the darkness

1104
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,140
庆祝您的回归
to celebrate your return.

1105
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,670
不用再点头哈腰了  我亲爱的子民
No more bowing and scraping, my beloveds.

1106
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,670
那不是我想要的
That is not what I want.

1107
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,180
我想要一支大军
I want an army,

1108
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,930
长期隐藏于人类的视线之外
long hidden from the eyes of man.

1109
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,790
我想要被遗忘的人走出黑暗
I want the forgotten people out of the dark!

1110
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:41,030
那些生活在尘土中的人
Those who have lived in dust,

1111
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:45,150
那些啃食干骨头  梦见鲜血的人
who have gnawed on dry bones while dreaming of blood!

1112
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,070
那就是我想要的  给我一支这样的军队
That is what I want. Give me an army like that

1113
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:52,370
我们会让白天的世界哭泣
and we will make the daytime world weep!

1114
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,350
不要像老鼠一样蜷缩在那里
Well, don't just cower there like mice.

1115
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,910
上前来
Step forth.

1116
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,480
亲爱的姐妹们
Dear sisters.

1117
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,860
你们真好  藏了那么多年
How kind of you to grace me with your presence

1118
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,250
现在过来捧场
after hiding all these years.

1119
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:18,570
求求您  妮缪  仁慈对待我和姐妹们
Please, Nimue, for me and my sisters, have mercy.

1120
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,270
戈内达  你对我仁慈过吗
Ganeida, did you show me mercy?

1121
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,570
当亚瑟把我砍碎
When Arthur cut me to pieces

1122
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,440
活埋我的时候
and buried me alive,

1123
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,450
你的仁慈在哪里
where was your mercy then?

1124
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,140
-不要  求求您  -看看你
- Don't, I beg you! - Look at you.

1125
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,500
像动物一样卑躬屈膝
Groveling like an animal.

1126
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,650
别担心  戈内达  我不会杀你的
Don't worry, Ganeida, I won't kill you.

1127
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,630
但你必须先为我做件事
But you must do something for me first

1128
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:54,310
来证明你新发现的忠诚
to prove your newfound loyalty.

1129
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,530
带地狱男爵去见那个能指引他命运的人
Take Hellboy to the one who can show him his destiny.

1130
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,560
不好意思  我打断你们了吗
Sorry! Did I interrupt?

1131
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,390
地狱男爵  你个混蛋
Hellboy, you bastard!

1132
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,680
我希望我没迟到
I hope I'm not late to the party!

1133
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,680
你来得正是时候
You've arrived just in time.

1134
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,260
数量太多了
There's too many.

1135
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:38,930
放开他
Get off him!

1136
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,490
你后面
Behind you!

1137
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,410
你从哪儿学来的
Where'd you learn how to do that?

1138
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,140
我不知道  自从我被精灵带走
I don't know. Ever since the fairies took me,

1139
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,130
我就能做一些奇怪的事
I've been able to do some weird shit.

1140
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,420
躲在我身后
Stay behind me.

1141
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,330
我还能去哪儿
Where else am I gonna go?

1142
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,680
带我们离开这里
Get us out of here!

1143
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,860
知道什么时候该等待
Know when to wait.

1144
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,640
现在没那么好笑了  是吧
Not so fucking funny now, eh?

1145
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,700
皇后陛下  恢复我的力量  让我干掉他
My Queen, restore me now! Let me finish him!

1146
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,300
现在还不行
Not just yet.

1147
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,040
但是你发过誓...
But you swore...

1148
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,950
管好你的舌头  猪头
Mind your tongue, pig.

1149
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:23,880
快走
Move it.

1150
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,230
进去
Get in.

1151
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,400
你想去哪儿
Where do you think you're going?

1152
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:38,200
去孕育一个新的世界
To give birth to a new world!

1153
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,870
是啊  通过杀害许多无辜的人
Yeah, by killing a lot of innocent people!

1154
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:46,240
为什么你要为那些憎恨和恐惧你的人而战
Why do you fight for those who hate and fear you?

1155
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,470
见到你之前  我只想要复仇
All I wanted was revenge, until I saw you.

1156
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,920
但你可以迎来世界末日
You can usher in the apocalypse.

1157
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,030
灰烬中将诞生新的伊甸园
Out of the ashes, a new Eden will emerge.

1158
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,820
抛下这些脆弱可怜的人类
Leave these frail, pathetic humans behind.

1159
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:02,450
做我的国王  以你的真实身份接受爱戴
Be my king. And be revered for who you really are.

1160
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,880
我们属于彼此  你和我
We belong together, you and I.

1161
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,120
确实如此  但是行不通的  你知道
We do! But it's not gonna work, you know,

1162
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,700
因为我是摩羯座  而你是他妈疯子座
'cause I'm a Capricorn and you're fucking nuts!

1163
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:16,480
你的体内沉睡着恶魔  我会唤醒它
A demon sleeps inside you, and I will waken it.

1164
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,430
地狱男爵  地狱男爵
Hellboy! Hellboy!

1165
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,870
即使我必须夺走你所爱过的
Even if I have to take away everything

1166
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,130
一切人事物
and everyone you've ever loved.

1167
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,830
我来了  孩子
I got you, kid.

1168
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,630
恭喜你  血皇后恢复了全部力量
Congratulations, the Blood Queen has all her powers now.

1169
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,450
别碰它
Don't touch it!

1170
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,620
那只会让它扩散得更快
It'll only make it spread faster.

1171
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,700
给你三秒钟时间来弥补
You got three seconds to make this right!

1172
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,720
我做不到
I can't.

1173
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,630
三
Three.

1174
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,650
妮缪的力量太强大了
Nimue's power is too strong.

1175
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:54,720
二
Two.

1176
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,360
旧世界有一个人可以帮助你
There is one who can help you from the Old World.

1177
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,070
在哪儿
Where?

1178
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,140
你不会真要听她的吧
You're not seriously gonna listen to her!

1179
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,090
她可能会把我们引入陷阱
She could be leading us straight into a trap!

1180
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,510
你可以救你的朋友
You can save your friend.

1181
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,700
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

1182
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,100
去黑鳍山
Go to Black Fin.

1183
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,460
在悬崖顶上
High atop the cliffs

1184
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,790
岩石中隐藏着一条古老的牧羊道
there's an old goat path hidden in the rocks.

1185
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,530
这条路充满危险
The way is treacherous,

1186
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:22,610
但你必须沿着它走到尽头
but you must follow it until you can go no further.

1187
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,130
在那  你会在山洞中找到通往地球内部的通道
There, you'll find a passage into the bowels of the Earth, in a cave.

1188
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,340
这边  戴米奥
This way, Daimio.

1189
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,890
你要找的人就在那里
The one you seek is there.

1190
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,370
智者梅林
Merlin the Wise.

1191
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:34,810
国王的巫师  愚者的国王
Wizard to kings, and king of fools.

1192
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:37,600
因为允许亚瑟背叛停战协议
Cursed to live forever buried in a hole

1193
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,880
而被诅咒永远活埋在洞里
for allowing Arthur to betray the truce.

1194
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,700
你终于要带走我的灵魂了吗
Have you finally come to claim my soul?

1195
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,190
我不是死神
That's the other guy.

1196
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,500
快点  我的朋友中毒了
Come on! My friend's been poisoned,

1197
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,650
有人告诉我们你能帮忙
and we were told that you can help!

1198
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,660
我见过这个  这是妮缪干的
I have seen this before. This is Nimue's work.

1199
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,390
你不能小瞧这个女巫
You cannot underestimate this witch.

1200
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:13,120
她是邪恶的化身
She is evil incarnate.

1201
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,520
如果我们迅速行动  还有机会
There's still a chance if we act quickly.

1202
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,790
但作为回报  你必须答应我一件事
But you must promise me something in return.

1203
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,560
你要不惜一切代价
That you will do whatever is necessary

1204
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,380
摧毁妮缪
to destroy Nimue, no matter the cost.

1205
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,130
我他妈保证做到
I can damn well guarantee it.

1206
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:43,860
[咒语]

1207
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,070
我们不用担心那东西要去哪吗
Should we be worried about where that's going?

1208
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,620
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

1209
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,310
新来的是谁
Who's the new guy?

1210
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,460
我说了你肯定不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1211
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:05,940
你为什么这么做
Why did you do that?

1212
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,940
让你的朋友休息  他们会没事的
Let your friends rest. They'll be fine.

1213
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:10,720
接下来发生的事你要独自面对
What comes next is for you and you alone.

1214
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,780
地狱男爵  你的故事在我耳边低语
Hellboy, your story whispered itself into my ear

1215
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:18,660
我意识到命运对我们两个另有安排
and I realized fate had something else in store for us both.

1216
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,900
-好吧  -告诉我
- Okay. - Tell me,

1217
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,190
你的时代中还有亚瑟王的传说吗
are there still tales of King Arthur in your time?

1218
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,440
他是怎样从石头中拔出剑来
How he drew the sword from the stone?

1219
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,010
是的  还有电影
Yeah. Movies, too.

1220
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,170
他是个常见的流行文化巨星
He's a regular pop culture phenom.

1221
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,410
把手给我
Give me your hand.

1222
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:36,620
人们以为亚瑟的血统随他而去了
People believe that Arthur's lineage died with him,

1223
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,080
但那不是真的
but it's not true.

1224
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,180
亚瑟有了一个女儿  那个女儿又有了女儿
The bloodline continued when Arthur had a daughter

1225
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:44,210
如此继续  血统就延续下去了
and that daughter had a daughter, and so on.

1226
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,570
最后一位是萨拉·贝瑟尼·休斯
Ending with Sarah Bethany Hughes.

1227
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,570
她曾在一个山羊形状的
She used to fly to the Sabbath

1228
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:52,640
恶魔的背上飞向安息日
on the back of a demon in the shape of a goat.

1229
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,730
然后在1574年的五朔节前夕
And on Walpurgis Night, 1574,

1230
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,890
她嫁给了那个恶魔
she married that demon.

1231
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,900
就在那天晚上  她被拖下了地狱
That very night she was taken down to hell,

1232
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,780
她在那里生下了一个儿子
where she delivered a son,

1233
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,990
阿努·恩·罗摩
Anung un Rama.

1234
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:13,070
最后那部分  我之前听到过  那是什么
That last part, I've heard that before. What is that?

1235
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:16,910
是你  阿努·恩·罗摩
It's you... Anung un Rama.

1236
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:19,460
万物毁灭者
Destroyer of all things.

1237
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,000
你出生那天被授予的头衔
The title you were given on the day you were born.

1238
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,940
所以我母亲是人类
So, my mother was human.

1239
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,070
你也是人类  至少一部分是

1240
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:35,100
亚瑟之子  王族最后的后裔

1243

所以我知道你是

唯一一个能做到必要的事的人

1245
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:56,410
王者之剑  唯一可以对抗妮缪的武器
Excalibur, the one weapon that can stand against Nimue.

1246

在动画里看起来比这大

1247

只有亚瑟的真正后裔才能挥动它
Only a true descendant of Arthur can wield it.

1248
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:08,710
地狱男爵  这是你与生俱来的权力  你的命运
It is your birthright, Hellboy, your destiny.

1249
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:19,560
这就是你摧毁血皇后的方法

1250

1253
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,170
快拔出来
Take it now!

1254
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,090
你个傻瓜
You fool!

1255
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:35,650
我用最后的魔力把王者之剑带到了这里
I used the last of my magic to bring Excalibur here.

1256
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:38,440
现在剑回到了亚瑟身边
Now the sword has returned to Arthur,

1257
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:41,100
唯一配得上它的人

1258
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,890
你本可以阻止她的

1259
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,790
至少我不会在这里

1260

看着这个世界凋零死亡

1261
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:11,520
跑啊  对  快跑

1262
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,800
你们这些可悲的混蛋

我要看证件  亲爱的

感染率远远高于最初...

你要告诉我们下面发生了什么吗

甘道夫去哪儿了

1288
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,420
好吧  剑在哪呢

我没拿剑
I didn't take the sword.

1290
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,320
因为如果我拿了  我就是那个

1293
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,120
少自大了
Get over yourself.

1294
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,910

出什么事了
What's wrong?

1298
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,280
血皇后刚刚攻破了超自然调查防御局
The Blood Queen just took out the B.P.R.D.

1299
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,740

{\an8}圣保罗大教堂大屠杀

1306
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,540
数百名武装警察继续与一名

1307
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,730
身份不明的袭击者交火

1308
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,830
让开
Get out of the way!

1309
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,100
我跟你们是一伙的

-抱歉  我的错  -十一军

任何情况下都不准进入
No one enters under any circumstances!

1312
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,860
她在哪儿
Where is she?

1313
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:27,160
爸
Dad!

1314
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,450
你好  地狱男爵
Hello, Hellboy.

1315
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:32,950
很抱歉皇后陛下不能亲自来迎接你
Sorry my queen couldn't be here to greet you in person.

1316
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,230
这可不是好兆头
That's not a good sign.

1317
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:39,850
他怎么变得这么大
How did he get so fucking big?

1318
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:42,190
地狱男爵  如你所见
Hellboy, as you can see,

1319
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:47,780
她确保了你能受到正式的欢迎
she's made sure you receive a proper fucking welcome.

1320
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:52,110

You've no idea how long I've been waiting for this.

1321

我可以想象
I have some idea!

1322
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:57,950
要知道  我就是那个让小猪仔

1323
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:59,980
一路尖叫着跑回家的家伙
all the way back home.

1324
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:01,730
找掩护
Take cover!

1325
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,030
我要把你的头拧下来
I'll rip your fucking head off!

1326
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:18,830
当心
Look out!

1327
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:26,220
小猪仔  我带来了你的最爱  铁
Little piggy, I brought your favorite! Iron!

1328
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,690
这次不管用了
That's not gonna work this time.

1329
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,640
我抬不动
It won't budge!

1330
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,730
尝尝这个  混蛋
Take that, you fucker!

1331
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:43,940
过来  你...
Come here, you...

1332
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,240
该死的浑蛋
Fucking bastard.

1333
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,460
离开这里
Get out of here.

1334
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,830
我不会就这么扔下你
I'm not just gonna leave you!

1335
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,300
快走
Go!

1336
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,650
滚开
Fuck off!

1337
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,590
看看你  你的脸就像狒狒的屁股
Look at ya. You got a face like a baboon's ass.

1338
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:14,800
乖乖躺在那儿流血  让我把你干掉
Now just lay there and bleed while I finish you off.

1339
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,010

Oh, yeah?

1340
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,370
祝你好运  伙计
Good luck with that, pal!

1341
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,880
该死的杂种
Fucking mutt.

1342
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,850
戴米奥
Daimio?

1343
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:39,310
我们吃烤肉吧
Let's eat some barbecue!

1344
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:53,840
-地狱男爵  -给我这个干什么
- Hellboy!  - What am I supposed to do with that?

1345
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,860
即兴发挥
Improvise!

1346
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:19,470
我要砸烂你的脑袋
I'm gonna squash your fucking head now.

1347
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:22,100
-来吧  你个红脸傻逼  -够了
- Here, you red-faced twat! - Enough!

1348
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:23,910
陛下
Your Majesty.

1349
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:26,730
放过他  我的宠物
Let him go, my pet.

1350
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:31,630
我们说好的  我把你拼齐了
We had a deal. I found you.

1351
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:36,050
这一切都是我策划的  我是一切的开始
I set all this in motion! I was the beginning of it all.

1352
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,740
而我是终点
And I am the end.

1353
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:44,370
原谅我  我需要有人挑战地狱男爵
Forgive me. I needed someone to challenge Hellboy,

1354
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,580
把他逼到绝境
push him to the edge.

1355
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:49,960
但你答应过的
But you promised!

1356
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,340
答应恢复你的力量
To make you whole again.

1357
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:55,090
无与伦比的强大
Powerful beyond compare.

1358
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,970
在短暂闪耀的时间内
And for one brief, shining moment,

1359
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,720
-确实实现了  -这不公平
- you were. - This ain't fair!

1360
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:07,020
你去死  地狱男爵
Fuck you, Hellboy!

1361
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,440
嗯  你也去死
Yeah, fuck you back.

1362
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,460
好了  该结束了
All right, time to finish this.

1363
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,320
但我不想杀你
But I don't want to kill you.

1364
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:19,720
我们不是敌人  我们被命运连结在一起
We are not enemies. We are bound together by fate!

1365
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,280
别再说这些废话了  女士
Not this crap again, lady!

1366
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,410
有些教训值得重复
Some lessons bear repeating.

1367
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,400
想想有多少人一生都在
Just think how many spent their lives

1368
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,440
寻找亚瑟的坟墓
searching for Arthur's tomb.

1369
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,440
它一直都在这里
It's been right here all along.

1370
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,950
拔剑吧  这是你的权力
Go ahead. It's yours by right.

1371
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:03,080
你能感受到  不是吗
You can feel it, can't you?

1372
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,830
它在呼唤你
How it calls to you.

1373
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:11,420
搅动你生命的核心
Stirring the thing at the core of your being.

1374
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:14,590
你注定要成为的人
The thing you're destined to be.

1375
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:19,510
拔剑吧
Go ahead, take it.

1376
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,970
你想杀我  不是吗
You want to kill me, don't you?

1377
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:32,120
拔剑  拔剑
Pick up the sword. Take it!

1378
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,270
不
No!

1379
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,360
我不知道你在耍什么把戏
I don't know what your game is here,

1380
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,280
但我不玩了
but I'm done playing!

1381
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,990
那好
Very well.

1382
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,120
爸  爸
Dad! Dad!

1383
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,540
别担心我
Don't worry about me.

1384
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:56,350
你做你该做的  干掉这个婊子
You do what you have to do and take out this bitch!

1385
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,900
不  妮缪  妮缪  不  放开他  妮缪
No! Nimue! Nimue, no! Let him go, Nimue!

1386
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:03,140
放开他  你想要的是我  来抓我
Let him go! It's me you want! Take me!

1387
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,390
你已经在我手上了
I already have you.

1388
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:10,770
你只是还不知道罢了
You just don't know it yet.

1389
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:17,400
不  不  不
No! No! No!

1390
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,110
爸
Dad!

1391
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,950
爸
Dad?

1392
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,700
不  求你别死
No. Please don't go.

1393
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:35,580
不
No!

1394
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:40,630
老天  伙计  你真是一团糟
Jesus Christ, mate. You're a mess.

1395
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:41,980
好吧  至少现在我知道为什么
Well, at least now I know why

1396
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:44,010
你一直表现的像个该死的混蛋了
you've been acting like such a fucking dick.

1397
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,720
我需要你立刻振作起来
I need you to pull it together now!

1398
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,510
他需要我们的帮助
He needs our help.

1399
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,390
别哭了
Save your tears.

1400
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,790
比起我为全人类准备的下场
His death is a mercy compared to

1401
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:58,150
他的死是一种仁慈
what I have in store for the rest of mankind.

1402
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:02,420
都是因为在你有机会使用王者之剑时
All because you were too cowardly to use Excalibur

1403
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,700
你太懦弱了
when you had the chance.

1404
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,420
你的两个父亲都会以你为耻
Both your fathers would be ashamed!

1405
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,660
妮缪
Nimue!

1406
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,240
到我这儿来
Come to me.

1407
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,120
到我这儿来
Come to me.

1408
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:56,580
来
Come.

1409
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:34,050
你太美了
You're so beautiful.

1410
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:37,270
现在你明白了  我们生来就要共同统治
Now you see that we were born to rule together.

1411
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:39,480
亚瑟只是个凡人
Arthur was just a man.

1412
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,810
在他手中  王者之剑是死亡的工具
In his hands, Excalibur was an instrument of death.

1413
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:46,650
但在你手中  你可以建立新的世界
But in yours, you can build a new world,

1414
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:50,110
为我们的同类建立更美好的世界
a better world for all our kind.

1415
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,700
陛下
My Lord.

1416
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:25,900
住手
Stop!

1417
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:34,450
这不是你  地狱男爵  你不是这样的人
This isn't you, Hellboy. You're better than this.

1418
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:39,760
别听这个老傻瓜的话  这是你命中注定的
Don't listen to this old fool. You were meant for this.

1419
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,600
她想利用你
She wants to use you,

1420
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,060
扭曲你的本性
make you into something you're not.

1421
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:47,130
所以别再发牢骚了
So stop being a whiny little shit

1422
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,300
向她证明她错了
and show her she's wrong.

1423
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:52,220
勇往直前  拥抱你的命运
Go forth and embrace your destiny.

1424
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,470
摧毁你的敌人
Destroy your enemies!

1425
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:58,310
没完没了地唠叨抱怨命运
All this bitching and moaning about destiny.

1426
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:01,700
成熟点吧  你是个男人
Grow a pair! You're a man!

1427
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:04,730
而且是个好人  做个好人
And a good one! Act like it.

1428
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:07,820
别让预言告诉你你是谁
Don't let a prophecy tell you who you are.

1429
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,030
你自己做决定
You decide for yourself.

1430
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,690
他在撒谎
He's lying!

1431
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:16,170
你是世界末日的伟大野兽
You are the great beast of the apocalypse.

1432
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:19,410
这就是真正的你  一直都是
This is the real you! It always has been.

1433
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:21,080
烧尽过去
Burn out the past.

1434
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:24,460
摆脱弱点
Be rid of the weakness.

1435
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:31,630
我的国王
My King.

1436
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,770
还没结束
This isn't over!

1437
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,960
我们注定要在一起
We are destined for one another!

1438
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,210
我们会再见面的
We will meet again

1439
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:38,990
在世界末日的最后一天
on the last day of the ending of the world!

1440
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,450
女士  别说了  你还剩
Lady, quit while you're...

1441
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,300
-一个头  -不
- A head.  - No!

1442
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:51,770
不
No!

1443
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:02,390
你早就知道  对不对
You knew, didn't you?

1444
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:04,310
一直都知道
This whole time.

1445
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,640
我体内的这个野兽
This beast inside me.

1446
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:10,100
我内心的本性
My inner nature!

1447
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,730
我的命运
My destiny!

1448
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,940
你也知道
So did you.

1449
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,780
那么多年前你为什么不杀了我
Why didn't you kill me all those years ago?

1450
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:21,030
你有任务
You had a job,

1451
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,740
保护世界不受怪物的侵害
to protect the world from monsters!

1452
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:30,790
我从来没有为那晚做的决定后悔过
I have never, ever regretted the decision I made that night.

1453
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,060
爸
Dad...

1454
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:38,470
闭嘴听我说  我有话要说
Shut up and listen to me. There's things I need to say.

1455
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:42,430
我尽力做我能做到的最好的父亲
I tried to be the best father I could.

1456
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,680
我怎么知道怎么养孩子
What the hell did I know about raising a kid?

1457
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:48,120
我是个杀手  而且很在行
I was a killer, and damn good at it.

1458
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,740
有些野兽罪有应得  有些则不是
Some beasts deserved it, some didn't.

1459
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:53,960
但我做了我认为必要的事
But I did what I believed was necessary.

1460
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,170
如果我死后有机会变成天使
And if I have any chance of growing wings,

1461
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:57,360
那都是因为你
it's because of you.

1462
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:01,570
你改变了我
You changed me.

1463
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,410
你改变了一切
You changed everything.

1464
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:10,620
如果这场看似永无止境的战争有结束的时候
And if there is ever an end in this seemingly forever war,

1465
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:15,210
那将是因为你和你强大的右手
it will be because of you and your strong right hand.

1466
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:20,260
你是人类最好的  也是唯一的希望  孩子
You are mankind's best and only hope, my boy.

1467
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:26,350
求你了  求你别死  我还没准备好
Please. Please don't go. I'm not ready.

1468
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:28,770
不  你准备好了
Oh, yes, you are.

1469
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:34,230
做你的父亲是我做过的最好的决定
Being your father was the best decision I ever made.

1470
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:37,400
我爱你  地狱男爵
I love you, Hellboy.

1471
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,980
我爱你  地狱男爵
I love you, Hellboy.

1472
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:09,850
那是什么
What's that?

1473
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:11,180
一个错误
A mistake.

1474
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:18,940
我喜欢猫
I like cats.

1475
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,320
我一直都更喜欢狗
I've always been more of a dog person.

1476
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,750
那么  现在你是英格兰国王了
So, you're the king of England now.

1477

不要这样鬼鬼祟祟地靠近我
Do not sneak up on me like that!

1491
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:27,180
你就不能停止抱怨吗
Don't you ever stop bitching?

1492
