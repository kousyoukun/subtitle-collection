00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:56,006
THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE

2
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:18,922
On this St Michael's Sunday
in the church of Artigat,

3
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,343
we receive Bertrande de Rols,

4
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,095
daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols

5
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,681
and of Raimonde, his wife.

6
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,184
And we receive Martin Guerre,

7
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:32,686
son of Mathurin Guerre

8
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,647
and of Brigitte, his wife.

9
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:54,124
I, Martin,
give my body to thee, Bertrande.

10
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,962
I accept it
and give my body to thee, Martin.

11
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,297
I accept it.

12
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,554
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony.

13
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,978
You will not regret
having followed this story

14
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:19,024
for it is neither a tale of adventure

15
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,984
nor an imaginary fable.

16
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,489
It is a true story.

17
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:32,162
It began one August Sunday, in 1542,

18
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,167
in the village of Artigat,
county of Foix,

19
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,212
in the reign of Francis I.

20
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,261
Bertrande, at her parents' decision,

21
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:50,514
brings a dowry of 30 acres of wheat

22
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,226
and 40 of millet,
at the place called Pomarede.

23
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:59,273
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods,

24
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:04,570
inherited from her father Laurent,
deceased.

25
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:10,367
Three red dresses,
a bed and two feather pillows,

26
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,036
one linen-chest with lock and key.

27
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:15,205
That's all.

28
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,374
Catherine.

29
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,543
Something to drink.

30
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,048
If you still agree, sign here.

31
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,229
You'll have to blow hard, my boy!

32
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,123
It's a good match, well arranged.

33
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,002
May the Lord bless this bed
with health...

34
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,677
and keep the Demon from this house.

35
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:13,138
Kiss her, Father.

36
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:22,689
Martin, tender buds
need to be sprinkled at night.

37
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:25,609
You two, kiss your brother.

38
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,950
Make us some pretty grandchildren!

39
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,545
The rest, you can do without me.

40
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,390
Whenever you want,
come eat and dance.

41
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,332
Make room!

42
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,792
Carry on, sir.

43
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:07,586
That's her.

44
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,380
That is Bertrande de Rols.

45
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:23,560
You say at first your husband couldn't
consummate your marriage. Why not?

46
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:28,440
Because of the spell
that had been cast on him.

47
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,528
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?

48
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,574
Yes... but I didn't.

49
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:41,995
I was married...

50
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,581
I felt bound to him.

51
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,416
People knew?

52
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,795
Of course.
We had no children.

53
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,005
They made fun of him?

54
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:55,092
Yes... the whole village.

55
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,431
Tell me what happened
that Candlemas Day.

56
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:52,065
A serenade for Bertrande
and her husband!

57
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,324
If you're tired of sleeping at night
change husbands!

58
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:06,037
Change husbands
if you want to have children!

59
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,359
Don't be afraid.

60
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,281
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament.

61
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,910
I am now in charge of this matter.

62
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,709
You must tell me everything.

63
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,545
Even if the priest said not to.

64
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:59,299
It's caused by evil thoughts.

65
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,219
They put a spell on you.

66
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,222
I'll take it away.

67
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:20,403
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you.

68
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,114
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you.

69
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,575
Blessed Flesh, I make you grow again.

70
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:35,293
Accursed Demon,
leave this servant of the Lord!

71
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,713
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin

72
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,466
whose flesh is suffering.

73
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,636
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin

74
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,972
whose flesh is suffering.

75
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,517
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Bertrande

76
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:52,769
whose flesh is suffering.

77
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,485
And do your best to help things along.

78
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,612
And that worked?

79
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:05,949
That very day, yes.

80
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,620
We had a son.

81
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:12,789
His name is Sanxi.

82
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,501
So all was well.

83
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,797
For me, yes, but Martin...

84
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:25,886
Martin kept to himself.

85
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,639
He didn't even look at our son.

86
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:33,810
He didn't like farming.

87
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,646
He and his father argued.

88
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,323
You want us to die of thirst?

89
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,042
Where were you?

90
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,669
You can't do anything right!

91
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:03,340
I was with some soldiers,
at the stream.

92
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,526
Two sacks of grain are gone.
You seen them?

93
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,612
You stole them.

94
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:28,907
You loaded the grain.
You stole them!

95
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,744
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!

96
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:36,039
I'll make you hate
the taste of bread!

97
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:38,583
I didn't take them!

98
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,086
While I'm alive, I'm the master here!

99
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,768
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?

100
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,398
Wear them Sunday.

101
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,404
You cut them too big.

102
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,073
You wasted your time.

103
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,908
You always scold me.

104
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,127
It's not my fault.

105
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,963
Be nice sometimes.

106
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:29,759
I'm sorry.

107
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,773
That was the night he left.

108
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,860
Why steal the grain?

109
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:51,281
Did he know he was leaving?

110
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,825
And needed money?

111
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,660
Maybe. I don't know.

112
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:58,204
He didn't talk much to me.

113
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,296
What did you think?

114
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,883
That he'd be back soon.

115
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:13,636
Everyone thought so.

116
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:17,057
That his father had scared him.

117
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:20,643
He waited for Martin
every day for months.

118
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,981
Finally he died... killed by sorrow.

119
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:28,026
Martin's mother died a year later.

120
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,373
Your mother got married again?

121
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,084
Yes.

122
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:48,379
To Pierre Guerre, my husband's uncle.

123
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,216
To keep the farms together?

124
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:53,510
No doubt.

125
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,846
Our lands are now held in common.

126
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,697
The wolves are out tonight.

127
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:17,742
Make sure the animals are locked up.

128
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:20,703
Yes, mother.
I do it every night.

129
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,517
You little rat!

130
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,480
Filthy rat!

131
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,941
Did Martin stay away long?

132
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,611
Eight winters, or nine.

133
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,989
You never heard from him?

134
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,701
No... Nothing.

135
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,288
But I'm sure
you had no lack of admirers.

136
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,957
No, but I kept my virtue.

137
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,127
Speak up, we can't hear you.

138
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:53,504
I kept my virtue.

139
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,466
Ask anyone. I remained chaste.

140
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,636
You never forgot Martin?

141
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,061
I prayed to St Catherine
to send him back.

142
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,024
So many seasons passed...

143
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,363
Then she heard me.

144
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,024
Hello, there.

145
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:59,904
Who are you?

146
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,117
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?

147
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:05,868
Who are you?

148
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,415
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely.

149
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:15,628
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

150
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,890
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?

151
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,063
- Is it you, Martin?
- You bet it is!

152
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,069
You're back!

153
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:46,951
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son.

154
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,245
No, Jacques is my brother.

155
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:51,331
Right...

156
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,916
You're "Smallpox André".

157
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:10,099
Remember the bear hunt,
when Nicolas "castrated" me?

158
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,519
Made me miserable, didn't you?

159
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,274
Martin Guerre is back!

160
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,276
You're bigger, Martin.

161
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,612
War does that.

162
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,660
Martin Guerre is back!

163
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,330
- What are you saying?
- You've seen him?

164
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,290
Yes! He's down the road.

165
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,181
Guillemette, your brother!

166
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,809
- Are you sure?
- I saw him!

167
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,602
The son of Mathurin?

168
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:57,647
Bertrande, your husband's back!

169
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:02,193
Come, it's your husband.

170
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,850
You still here?

171
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,185
Hello, Barthélemy.

172
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,441
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!

173
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:05,214
Hello, Jeanne, sister.

174
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,216
Martin! At last!

175
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,594
You've changed!

176
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:16,267
Where's your husband?

177
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,235
Are you Guillemette?

178
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:34,076
You were so small when I left!

179
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:38,915
Come kiss your brother!

180
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,840
Sanxi?

181
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,640
You're so big.

182
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:58,643
Don't be afraid.

183
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,313
Come nearer.

184
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:05,358
I'm your father.

185
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:27,505
Hello, uncle.

186
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,342
You were gone a long time.

187
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:35,972
That's true.

188
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:39,475
Forgive me for what I did.

189
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:45,356
Your father and mother are dead.

190
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,860
I heard, and I prayed for them.

191
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,907
I also heard you married Raimonde...

192
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:58,327
my wife's mother.

193
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:01,998
It's good news.

194
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,335
My daughter has suffered.

195
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,548
Have you changed for the better?

196
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,475
You're here...

197
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,020
It's all true!

198
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,523
Is it really you?

199
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,367
Is it you, Catherine?

200
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,413
You haven't changed.

201
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:51,380
I wondered if you'd ever come back.

202
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:56,052
And here you are, safe and sound.

203
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:18,532
- Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house.

204
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,243
She's waiting for you.

205
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,250
To the wash-house!

206
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,115
It's me.

207
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,015
It's me. Martin.

208
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:43,033
Hello, Martin.

209
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,844
My God, my wife is beautiful.

210
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,544
It is a gift of God
that you have returned.

211
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:49,099
He was in the Army in Picardy.

212
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,443
Don't you recognize me?

213
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,821
Who are you?

214
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:04,240
It's me. Nicolas.

215
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:18,337
It's confusing, seeing you all.

216
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:54,832
Here's cloth from Flanders.

217
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:57,710
The nicest for Bertrande, with lace.

218
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,636
Catherine, take the last one.

219
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,697
You've learned to read?

220
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:36,081
And to write, too.

221
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:39,043
To write?

222
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:53,891
What did you do all this time?

223
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:01,857
I fought in the war.

224
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:05,736
I even went to Spain.

225
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,745
Then I wanted to see you.

226
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,797
All of you.

227
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,674
What's Spain like?

228
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,717
It's dry.

229
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,971
And Paris? Did you see Paris?

230
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,724
It's big.

231
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,812
There are people everywhere.

232
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:42,731
I even got lost there.

233
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,911
There are thieves at night.

234
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,665
You're so strong now, Martin!

235
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,709
This calls for a celebration!

236
00:30:04,294 --> 00:30:06,296
When you left here, Martin...

237
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,924
you didn't have a beard yet.

238
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:11,969
And you didn't drink as much!

239
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:16,598
Now I drink like a monk!

240
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,185
After war...

241
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,312
Peace!

242
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:24,148
To you, my wife.

243
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:37,828
A little rough, but not bad.

244
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:40,622
Just enough to kill the worms!

245
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,309
I'll prepare your bed.

246
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:13,989
It's good to be on your own land.

247
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:17,868
What are you looking for?

248
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:19,995
The candles.

249
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:21,663
In there.

250
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,041
You moved them?

251
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,669
No, they've always been there.

252
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,007
Then I forgot.

253
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:01,745
She cried a lot because of you.

254
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,624
Remember, Bertrande?

255
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,919
Go get my white breeches,

256
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,713
the one lined with silk,

257
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:15,884
from the linen-chest.

258
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,973
If they're still there.

259
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,148
<i>I'll go.</i>

260
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,320
You've found your smile.

261
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:52,588
"The bird's back in the nest.
Tonight they will not rest."

262
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,154
They're still here.

263
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:21,950
Waiting for you, like me.

264
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,550
I'll wear them tomorrow.

265
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:19,841
How often I've wanted you...

266
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,273
I'm here only because of you.

267
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,071
So everyone recognized him?

268
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,906
Yes, everyone.

269
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,117
His sisters...

270
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,077
His uncle...

271
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,788
Catherine, the servant?

272
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,790
His friends...
The whole village.

273
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:55,419
You, too?

274
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:58,297
Me, too.

275
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:01,300
Without hesitation?

276
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,808
Then what?

277
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:13,395
He took up his work,
his place at home.

278
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,607
We had two children.

279
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,234
The first died.

280
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,486
The second is alive, a girl.

281
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,071
18 months old.

282
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,659
And everything went well?

283
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:29,244
Very well.

284
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,496
Better than before?

285
00:35:31,747 --> 00:35:32,664
Yes.

286
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:36,084
And he worked hard.

287
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:39,463
Our harvests have never been better.

288
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:42,466
And between you two?

289
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,093
It's been good.

290
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,933
When did the doubts first begin?

291
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:56,104
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn.

292
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,123
You!

293
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,668
A game for 15 points?

294
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,963
I don't gamble.

295
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:28,553
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy relic?

296
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:31,306
Go to the devil, we have a priest!

297
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:36,478
I'm going back.

298
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:43,151
I'll play-

299
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:46,154
Dominique, play with me.

300
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:48,824
No, I think not. Like Martin.

301
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:52,702
Come on, Father. Only 15 points.

302
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:00,669
Who is he?

303
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:02,587
It's Martin.

304
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:08,677
Martin Guerra,
who went away and came back.

305
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,470
Like the prodigal son.

306
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,265
He's not Martin Guerre.

307
00:37:14,182 --> 00:37:15,851
I knew Martin Guerre.

308
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:20,856
At the battle of Saint-Quentin.

309
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,609
In fact, he lost a leg there.

310
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:26,403
Of course, it's Martin.

311
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:30,240
I ought to know,
I'm the one who married him.

312
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:32,033
But it's not.

313
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:35,245
He's...

314
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:39,249
What's his name again?

315
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:45,213
I knew him on the Army, too.

316
00:37:46,256 --> 00:37:47,382
It's Martin!

317
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,051
We're even related.

318
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:53,388
I tell you he's not Martin.

319
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:56,266
He's Pansette!

320
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,059
That's it.

321
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,061
Pansette.

322
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,400
He's from the village of Tihl.

323
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:08,445
I knew him in Picardie, too.

324
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:14,117
What's he doing here?

325
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:17,245
I saw two of those people in Arras.

326
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:19,748
From a land called Brazil.

327
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,256
Their bodies were all painted.

328
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,677
They had feathers on their heads.

329
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,846
It's true, Sanxi.

330
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:42,854
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us.

331
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:51,655
They were in chains,
and made to dance.

332
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,290
In their own country, they go naked.

333
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,835
Even the women?

334
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,380
Sounds like a nice country.

335
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:10,465
Then you should go there.

336
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,184
They eat their prisoners' hearts.

337
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,314
Are they human?

338
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,109
Do they have a soul?

339
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,902
The monks say they do.

340
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:40,161
In some tribes,
they share their land and their women.

341
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:45,500
In others, the women go to war
and make all the decisions.

342
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:53,508
The day women rule here,

343
00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:56,886
it'll be the end of the world.

344
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:04,436
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind.

345
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,554
No! Let's go home, I'm afraid.

346
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,266
Why?

347
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,565
See! A circle of smoke.

348
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,234
Spirits will be out.

349
00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:56,237
We mustn't look at them.

350
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,757
Pansette! What are you doing?

351
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,301
Leaving us already?

352
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,515
Trying to find your way?

353
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:27,977
When are you going?

354
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:31,106
Did you come to the wrong village?

355
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:45,662
It's you!
Doesn't surprise me, idiot!

356
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,335
He's strong!

357
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,004
Not like Martin. Right, Bertrande?

358
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:58,800
Pansette, you look true
but you play false.

359
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,803
Beware!

360
00:42:11,688 --> 00:42:13,648
Where was this soldier from?

361
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,817
A garrison in Picardy.

362
00:42:22,866 --> 00:42:25,660
Don't believe tales told by strangers.

363
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:28,329
And by drunks.

364
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:30,498
Or by rogues.

365
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,543
He's right.

366
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,674
"Lies come easy from afar."

367
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,514
We know Martin well.

368
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:13,416
If anyone knows Martin...

369
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:16,586
it's us.

370
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,003
We must do our accounts one day.

371
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:02,632
How much my land earned
in my absence.

372
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,593
What do you mean?

373
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:11,599
You worked my land and I'm grateful,
but it made a profit.

374
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:13,768
Now I need the money.

375
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,438
I figure it's about 6000 livres.

376
00:44:18,273 --> 00:44:21,442
You dare ask me for an accounting?

377
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:27,657
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?

378
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:30,660
I, who protected your wife?

379
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,623
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?

380
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:39,961
It was your duty!
I went to war, I have a right to it!

381
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,796
You have no right. You left!

382
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,174
Yes, I have!
I have the law on my side.

383
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:48,845
I'll seek justice, if I must.

384
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,515
You'll be condemned.

385
00:44:52,807 --> 00:44:54,642
You threaten your uncle?

386
00:44:59,147 --> 00:45:00,732
I need that money.

387
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:08,323
I'll sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pujol's.

388
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,326
To plant barley.

389
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:16,664
You want to sell your father's field?

390
00:45:17,665 --> 00:45:19,709
It's too steep for planting.

391
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,672
You're starting
to squander our property!

392
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:28,009
But I expected it.

393
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,678
I'm not surprised.

394
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,848
I warn you...

395
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:37,352
Martin or not Martin...

396
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,938
you won't get away with it!

397
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:41,689
What did you say?

398
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:44,525
Repeat that!

399
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:47,111
What did you say?

400
00:45:49,364 --> 00:45:50,698
Let go of me!

401
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:56,746
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too.

402
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,790
The whole village did.

403
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:00,708
You all welcomed him.

404
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:04,963
Look at Bertrande.

405
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:08,383
She's not complaining.

406
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,301
She's never looked better.

407
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:12,887
When he came back,

408
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:15,390
he'd been gone a long time.

409
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:22,397
What if we were all mistaken?

410
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:27,568
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?

411
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,614
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief.

412
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,410
You're right to stand up to him.

413
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:40,164
You be careful, too.

414
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:46,295
After me, it'll be your turn.

415
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:49,132
He'll wipe your ass.

416
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:52,510
And take your shirt!

417
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:58,433
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again.

418
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,437
Leaving you your eyes to cry with.

419
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:05,606
Then you'll see
what kind of man he is!

420
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,956
The work isn't finished!

421
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:27,003
I'm ashamed of you, uncle.

422
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,493
My father wants you.

423
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,996
I'm coming.

424
00:48:16,177 --> 00:48:17,720
What do you want?

425
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,014
I've thought it over.

426
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:25,603
You're right.
I have the money.

427
00:48:25,853 --> 00:48:29,023
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you.

428
00:48:30,024 --> 00:48:31,901
I don't want any trouble.

429
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:42,036
Know where your father hid money?

430
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:47,959
No, he never told me.

431
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:52,880
In the hay-loft above the stable.

432
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:05,726
I'll wait for you there
at cook's crow.

433
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,146
I'll give you your due.

434
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:19,991
But let's keep it to ourselves.

435
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:50,771
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales.

436
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,108
They're all jealous.

437
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,529
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar.

438
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:00,948
All they talk about is us.

439
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,827
Calm down, my uncle has understood.

440
00:50:04,952 --> 00:50:06,704
He'll shut them up.

441
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,123
Give me your hand.

442
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,137
Let me guide you.

443
00:50:37,026 --> 00:50:38,819
Is that her name?

444
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,157
Yes, that's my name.

445
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,263
It's in the grain chest.

446
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:21,028
You wanted it, right?

447
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:24,448
You wanted what we owe you?

448
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:28,077
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...

449
00:51:29,036 --> 00:51:30,204
in hard cash!

450
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,044
You won't ask for it again!

451
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,425
At your service, Pansette!

452
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,095
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!

453
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:06,824
You were ready to die for him?

454
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,744
Yes, to protect him.

455
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:14,248
Explain something to me.

456
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:19,587
You defended your husband,
risking your own life.

457
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:23,466
But when his uncle
attacked him legally,

458
00:52:23,591 --> 00:52:25,301
you didn't say anything.

459
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,346
You should've protested,

460
00:52:30,097 --> 00:52:31,849
talked to the judge,

461
00:52:32,475 --> 00:52:35,519
told everyone:
"I know he's my husband."

462
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:39,106
But you said nothing.

463
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:43,611
Why?

464
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,453
Did you have doubts, too?

465
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,874
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?

466
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:02,963
At one moment, I was troubled.

467
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,300
I wavered.

468
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:08,677
I thought...

469
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:10,137
Speak up.

470
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:14,809
I thought:
"Maybe he's fooling me, too."

471
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:19,688
Charming me, as he did others.

472
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:23,692
Then my daughter is a bastard.

473
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:29,490
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell.

474
00:53:31,826 --> 00:53:34,161
Yes... I had doubts.

475
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,164
And still have?

476
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,168
No, not any more.

477
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,170
Then he is your husband?

478
00:53:44,672 --> 00:53:46,215
Yes or no?

479
00:53:49,218 --> 00:53:50,928
I say yes.

480
00:53:57,726 --> 00:53:59,228
And what does he say?

481
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:01,230
The same thing, obviously.

482
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:03,399
He says they're man and wife.

483
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:07,611
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament.

484
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,041
Go join your family.

485
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:26,255
You are Martin Guerre?

486
00:54:27,756 --> 00:54:29,300
Yes, lam.

487
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:31,635
You're quite sure?

488
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,805
I don't know of any other.

489
00:54:42,229 --> 00:54:43,105
Walk on.

490
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,784
You're going TO Pay-

491
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:58,787
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!

492
00:54:58,913 --> 00:55:01,373
The law will punish you,
you cheater!

493
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:04,585
You tricked us to steal our property!

494
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,003
Silence!

495
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,090
The family apart...

496
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:11,842
Over here.

497
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:28,359
Now listen to me, all of you.

498
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,030
Those who honestly think...

499
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:37,326
this man is not Martin Guerre,
to my left.

500
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:54,677
Shame on you, Nicolas!

501
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:03,352
Those who honestly think...

502
00:56:03,978 --> 00:56:07,815
he truly is Martin Guerre,

503
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:10,985
to my right.

504
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:25,541
And you?

505
00:56:30,337 --> 00:56:32,339
I am their priest.

506
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:37,344
But surely you have an opinion.

507
00:57:11,545 --> 00:57:13,631
The others have no opinion?

508
00:57:21,597 --> 00:57:24,433
In settlement of this dispute,

509
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:29,063
I, Jean de Cores,
Councillor of the Toulouse Parliament,

510
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:32,316
declare that there is no reason

511
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:35,235
to believe
this man is not Martin Guerre.

512
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,281
The charge is dismissed
for lack of proof.

513
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:43,619
This man shall be released.

514
00:57:44,578 --> 00:57:46,288
Pierre Guerre is condemned

515
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:50,292
to pay 500 livres
to the king and to his nephew

516
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:52,419
for calumny.

517
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,176
Free him.

518
00:58:10,104 --> 00:58:11,480
You are a knave!

519
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:14,483
God knows it
and will punish you!

520
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:18,487
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other.

521
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,661
That was an excellent judgment.

522
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:04,968
What happened to my brother?

523
01:00:05,552 --> 01:00:08,222
You should be in bed.

524
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,576
On your feet.
This time we've got you.

525
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,160
Get dressed.

526
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:14,454
- What?
- Get dressed.

527
01:01:14,663 --> 01:01:17,624
- You're under arrest.
- I was released yesterday!

528
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,794
Things changed during the night.

529
01:01:21,795 --> 01:01:22,963
Look.

530
01:01:24,965 --> 01:01:27,467
This time, your wife signed, too.

531
01:01:29,636 --> 01:01:31,513
- My wife?
- Here.

532
01:01:38,186 --> 01:01:41,398
Get dressed!
You're going to Toulouse.

533
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:45,193
When did she sign?

534
01:01:45,694 --> 01:01:49,239
Last night,
before going to bed.

535
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:53,744
Is it true?

536
01:01:54,995 --> 01:01:56,246
They made you sign?

537
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:02,544
Hurry UP!

538
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:06,506
This time, you're done for.

539
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,710
The accusation is the same,

540
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:47,923
but it will be more difficult
to answer.

541
01:02:49,216 --> 01:02:51,885
- Your wife signed.
- It's a forgery!

542
01:02:52,386 --> 01:02:56,098
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?

543
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,059
Her uncle and cousins scare her.

544
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:02,562
They might cut her throat.

545
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:05,565
They've threatened her?

546
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:09,236
Often .

547
01:03:11,738 --> 01:03:13,323
Especially lately.

548
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:19,579
She now says you betrayed her.

549
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,125
That you're not her husband.
That's serious.

550
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,335
I know her.

551
01:03:25,752 --> 01:03:27,421
They forced her to sign.

552
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:30,924
Assure her safety,

553
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,594
and ask me what you want.
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre.

554
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:39,808
We've heard many witnesses,

555
01:03:42,811 --> 01:03:44,938
and we shall hear more.

556
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,611
Shall a councillor defend you?

557
01:03:53,113 --> 01:03:56,658
I don't need help to prove who I am.

558
01:03:57,868 --> 01:03:59,202
Who married you?

559
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:04,458
Father Dominique Caylar.
He's still there.

560
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:07,127
He doesn't like me
because I swear a lot.

561
01:04:08,795 --> 01:04:12,340
We married on St Michael's day,
18 years ago.

562
01:04:12,632 --> 01:04:14,134
Who was the notary?

563
01:04:17,637 --> 01:04:20,474
Jehan Pegala, from Le Fossat.

564
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:27,481
He was late, my father was upset.

565
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:33,195
Bertrande's dowry
was the Roussas woods,

566
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:37,991
her lands at Pomarede, two oxen,

567
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:40,994
a bed with feather pillows,

568
01:04:43,371 --> 01:04:44,706
and three dresses.

569
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:46,500
And sacks of grain.

570
01:04:47,209 --> 01:04:48,835
Have you forgotten?

571
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:54,883
No.

572
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,720
No sack of grain.

573
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:10,857
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband.

574
01:05:12,192 --> 01:05:14,027
That wasn't so before.

575
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:19,908
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left.

576
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:21,701
And she's changed.

577
01:05:24,204 --> 01:05:25,705
So have I.

578
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:32,045
You're not stupid.

579
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:44,891
You know you risk death?

580
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:48,061
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!

581
01:05:48,895 --> 01:05:51,314
I was his nephew
until I wanted my money.

582
01:05:51,565 --> 01:05:55,110
Everyone knew me:
my sisters, my wife's mother...

583
01:05:55,902 --> 01:05:56,945
Even my wife.

584
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,322
Others also say you're not Martin.

585
01:05:59,573 --> 01:06:01,074
My uncle's rich!

586
01:06:01,908 --> 01:06:03,952
They're afraid of him.

587
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:06,913
He acts out of self-interest.

588
01:06:07,581 --> 01:06:10,500
He'd rob me of my name
and my property.

589
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:12,460
It's outrageous!

590
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:15,755
Follow me.

591
01:06:52,959 --> 01:06:56,963
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?

592
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,556
You asked to see this man.

593
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:14,814
Do you know him?

594
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,741
Yes... It's him.

595
01:07:26,493 --> 01:07:27,869
Who is he?

596
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:30,997
What's his name?

597
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,001
It's Arnaud.

598
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,010
It's Arnaud.

599
01:07:46,554 --> 01:07:48,014
They call him Pansette.

600
01:07:50,016 --> 01:07:51,518
Where is he from?

601
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,230
Our village.

602
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,025
- He's from Tihl.
- You're sure?

603
01:08:00,026 --> 01:08:02,028
He left a long time ago,

604
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,114
but that's him.

605
01:08:05,573 --> 01:08:08,702
- Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?
- No.

606
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:11,871
Arnaud, from Tihl.

607
01:08:11,997 --> 01:08:13,248
Called Pansette!

608
01:08:13,373 --> 01:08:14,708
Look at them.

609
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,294
Look at them!

610
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:20,130
They're sent by my uncle!

611
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:23,883
Bought and paid for!

612
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:25,635
Look at them.

613
01:08:26,094 --> 01:08:27,721
Shame written on their faces!

614
01:08:28,096 --> 01:08:31,099
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified.

615
01:08:33,101 --> 01:08:34,394
So what?

616
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:37,063
My uncle has influence.

617
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,482
Why would I pretend?

618
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:42,569
To have a house and a wife.

619
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,115
But it's my house, and my wife!

620
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,576
I'm wronged, and I'm accused!

621
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:57,083
Never was a husband so maligned!

622
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,085
But I'll appeal...

623
01:08:59,627 --> 01:09:01,671
To the Parliament, here.

624
01:09:01,963 --> 01:09:04,090
I want my uncle to be punished!

625
01:09:06,092 --> 01:09:07,719
So it'll all be clear!

626
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:09,971
I want them all here.

627
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:14,434
First Pierre,
guilty of bearing false witness.

628
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:18,146
Also my sisters and cousins.

629
01:09:19,773 --> 01:09:23,526
And my wife who was forced to sign,
and all the villagers!

630
01:09:23,777 --> 01:09:26,613
All those who've known me
since I was born!

631
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:39,561
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years!

632
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:42,355
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him.

633
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:46,192
When he left, he was thinner,

634
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,362
darker and a bit stooped.

635
01:10:50,864 --> 01:10:54,576
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips.

636
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:58,204
And a hairy mole on his neck...

637
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:00,081
Show us.

638
01:11:01,374 --> 01:11:02,709
Here, on his neck.

639
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,882
There's no trace of it.

640
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:17,432
And a scar above his right eyebrow.

641
01:11:18,558 --> 01:11:19,642
Also not there.

642
01:11:20,059 --> 01:11:22,228
No, sir. That's wrong.

643
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,690
I knew Martin when he was little, too.

644
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,109
I diapered him,

645
01:11:28,234 --> 01:11:30,403
and saw him naked
more often than you!

646
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:34,282
He had no hairy mole.

647
01:11:35,283 --> 01:11:37,410
He had a scar on his forehead...

648
01:11:37,911 --> 01:11:39,245
and still has.

649
01:11:42,415 --> 01:11:44,292
It was closer to his eyebrow.

650
01:11:44,751 --> 01:11:47,003
It was here.

651
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:49,923
I ought to know.

652
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:53,092
He fell in the barn, I picked him up.

653
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,929
Also... Open your mouth.

654
01:11:58,014 --> 01:11:59,682
He broke two teeth.

655
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:01,434
There they are,

656
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:03,520
in the back.

657
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,106
And a pushed-in thumbnail.

658
01:12:11,486 --> 01:12:15,114
So you maintain
that he is Martin Guerre?

659
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:18,785
I'm sure, sir.

660
01:12:19,452 --> 01:12:21,371
As sure as night follows day.

661
01:12:21,496 --> 01:12:23,039
May I speak?

662
01:12:23,248 --> 01:12:24,499
Speak.

663
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,502
I've seen death.

664
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:30,880
I heard the rear of cannons

665
01:12:31,339 --> 01:12:33,299
and the screams of the wounded.

666
01:12:35,468 --> 01:12:39,847
You wish me ill, uncle,
but I've lived through worse.

667
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:45,687
But must that be a man's fate
for wanting to live a little

668
01:12:46,145 --> 01:12:48,314
before returning to his family,

669
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,109
to work the land God gave us?

670
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,486
Don't let him talk any more!

671
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:57,490
He's clever with words.

672
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:59,909
We know who he is now.

673
01:13:00,326 --> 01:13:03,204
All he wanted
was my nephew's property.

674
01:13:03,496 --> 01:13:06,332
I don't want to take it,

675
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:09,002
I'm defending it!

676
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,338
He's not my nephew.

677
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:15,592
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it.

678
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:18,511
Cobbler, step forward.

679
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,183
Is it sure they'll let me go?

680
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,563
If I say what I have to say,
can l then leave?

681
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:32,358
I guarantee you'll return
to your village.

682
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:38,823
Before he left, Martin Guerre

683
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,950
had a very large foot.

684
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:45,580
His size was 12 points.

685
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:51,210
After he came back...

686
01:13:52,378 --> 01:13:55,548
his size was only 9 points.

687
01:13:58,468 --> 01:13:59,719
You're quite sure?

688
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:02,388
Yes.

689
01:14:02,597 --> 01:14:05,558
In my trade,
I've seen feet grow bigger,

690
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:09,437
but I've never known feet to shrink.

691
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:13,316
You're getting old!

692
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:16,361
Your sight's going...
You forget things.

693
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,155
I see better than you, you old mule!

694
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,449
You see where your interest lies!

695
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:25,411
Jacmette, your fingers remember.

696
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,010
Tell them who I am.

697
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:43,638
Tell the truth.

698
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,029
You're Martin Guerre.

699
01:15:03,449 --> 01:15:05,618
Bertrande, my wife,

700
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:07,704
you know me better than anyone.

701
01:15:08,454 --> 01:15:11,541
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield.

702
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:15,586
Swear it on the Holy Gospel.

703
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:18,297
You won't swear it?

704
01:15:20,508 --> 01:15:22,343
Therefore I am your husband?

705
01:15:23,845 --> 01:15:25,638
You are my husband.

706
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:33,896
Step forward, Bertrande.

707
01:15:47,493 --> 01:15:48,828
And this cross?

708
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:51,748
I didn't draw it.

709
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,587
Then why didn't you protest?

710
01:15:58,087 --> 01:15:59,547
They threatened me.

711
01:15:59,881 --> 01:16:00,840
Who?

712
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,175
To throw me out.

713
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,177
She's lying!

714
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,971
- That cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!

715
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,515
They'll do anything!
They tried to kill me!

716
01:16:10,016 --> 01:16:11,517
It's her mark.

717
01:16:12,351 --> 01:16:13,728
I saw her sign it.

718
01:16:13,853 --> 01:16:15,605
I didn't sign!

719
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:19,567
I would have signed my name.

720
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,530
How? You can't write.

721
01:16:25,698 --> 01:16:27,784
I'd like a quill and some paper.

722
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,618
Pierre, how long are we staying here?

723
01:17:10,743 --> 01:17:12,328
I don't know...

724
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:14,747
As long as it takes.

725
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:24,090
Who pays for it?

726
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,591
<i>I'll pay You-</i>

727
01:17:26,092 --> 01:17:28,803
Enough to live on. That's the law.

728
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:32,849
Who is Bertrande de Rois?

729
01:17:33,641 --> 01:17:35,476
Why do you want her?

730
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:37,770
She is to be housed separately.

731
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:49,991
You see me, Blessed Virgin Mary.

732
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:53,286
You see the distress and sorrow I'm in.

733
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:58,457
I'm begging you, help me-

734
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,794
Protect me.

735
01:18:05,798 --> 01:18:10,052
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?

736
01:18:10,303 --> 01:18:12,805
Accused, sit down and stay seated!

737
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,473
Continue.

738
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,642
Continue.

739
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:18,978
Didn't he?

740
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:22,315
Money to pay for killing me!

741
01:18:25,026 --> 01:18:27,320
Call Dominge Pailhas.

742
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,323
Is he here?

743
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:35,661
Come forward.

744
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:48,090
Don't be afraid.

745
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:51,010
Tell the truth.

746
01:18:51,344 --> 01:18:54,096
Did Pierre offer you money?

747
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,682
Be honest. Yes or no?

748
01:18:57,934 --> 01:19:01,354
Yes, he offered me money.

749
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:05,566
I said I wouldn't kill a relative,

750
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:07,193
even for money.

751
01:19:07,693 --> 01:19:10,237
I'm sort of related to Martin.

752
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:13,032
It's true, that's what he said.

753
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:19,121
Thank you.

754
01:19:19,872 --> 01:19:21,457
Go back to your seat.

755
01:19:21,874 --> 01:19:23,376
Jeanne, come here.

756
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:28,255
Speak up now.

757
01:19:28,381 --> 01:19:31,884
Didn't uncle
urge my wife to accuse me?

758
01:19:37,723 --> 01:19:38,724
It's true.

759
01:19:40,559 --> 01:19:43,312
Didn't he threaten to throw her out?

760
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,065
Yes, it's true.

761
01:19:46,899 --> 01:19:49,735
Didn't he raise his hand to her?

762
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:53,614
It's a lie!

763
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,574
Silence!

764
01:20:00,413 --> 01:20:03,040
Let me talk to her husband.

765
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:06,502
- Augustin, come here.
- The accused will remain seated!

766
01:20:08,921 --> 01:20:10,506
Augustin, come here!

767
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:15,428
You lived under our roof.

768
01:20:15,928 --> 01:20:18,806
After the soldier had been there,

769
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:21,350
you said: be careful.

770
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:25,521
My uncle was sending people after me
to beat me up.

771
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:27,523
Remember?

772
01:20:28,315 --> 01:20:29,650
To teach me a lesson.

773
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:33,279
You must remember!

774
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:37,783
We'd beaten the Vals team 4-2,
a Sunday in August!

775
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:44,957
I remember.

776
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,835
It's true.

777
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:50,463
So, uncle,

778
01:20:50,588 --> 01:20:53,215
you thought I'd never find out?

779
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:57,678
He's the impostor, the criminal!

780
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:00,139
He should be sitting here.

781
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:07,480
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...

782
01:21:08,814 --> 01:21:10,441
who profaned God...

783
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:11,984
What do I care?

784
01:21:13,819 --> 01:21:15,821
I'm not Arnaud of Tihl!

785
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,369
I'm not that man!

786
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:30,211
I'm not that man.

787
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:55,736
The man's memory is prodigious...

788
01:21:56,362 --> 01:21:58,114
and he's very clever.

789
01:22:00,908 --> 01:22:02,701
What if he were a demon?

790
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:08,290
It has happened before.

791
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,418
Demons like to enter human beings

792
01:22:11,544 --> 01:22:13,546
and poison their minds.

793
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,883
What do you think?

794
01:22:22,555 --> 01:22:25,141
Lies have a thousand faces...

795
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:27,560
even the Demon's.

796
01:22:28,894 --> 01:22:30,896
Truth has only one.

797
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:33,566
And justice exists...

798
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:35,901
to discover the truth.

799
01:22:36,902 --> 01:22:38,279
He knew everything.

800
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:41,574
Better than anyone in the village.

801
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:44,785
When he came back...

802
01:22:46,162 --> 01:22:48,414
he knew my sons' names!

803
01:22:50,749 --> 01:22:53,127
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move.

804
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,755
I felt that I was...

805
01:22:57,965 --> 01:22:59,091
on fire!

806
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:09,935
I'm sure he uses magic.

807
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:13,939
Even here, with all of us!

808
01:23:15,316 --> 01:23:16,984
Since the world began,

809
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:19,486
Satan has had a store of magic.

810
01:23:21,113 --> 01:23:22,948
How can he know so much?

811
01:23:23,616 --> 01:23:25,784
And have all the answers?

812
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:29,455
He is the Devil's emissary.

813
01:23:29,705 --> 01:23:31,957
Perhaps he is a devil himself.

814
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:34,376
I'm not a devil!

815
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,795
Silence! Sit down!

816
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:40,716
If a devil is in you,

817
01:23:41,008 --> 01:23:42,009
speak.

818
01:23:42,843 --> 01:23:44,136
Tell us his name.

819
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:48,849
A devil? Then I'd be with my wife!

820
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:51,143
I wouldn't have been arrested!

821
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,145
I wouldn't be here!

822
01:23:57,483 --> 01:23:58,984
He answered well.

823
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:02,738
There is no proof of any magic.

824
01:24:03,656 --> 01:24:05,824
What should we do?

825
01:24:06,992 --> 01:24:08,244
Any Suggestions?

826
01:24:10,204 --> 01:24:12,581
The most humane solution...

827
01:24:13,374 --> 01:24:16,502
Presume innocence
if guilt is not proven.

828
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:20,547
But first...

829
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,176
I'd like another chance to question

830
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:27,554
Martin Guerre's wife.

831
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:46,448
The Court turns to you.

832
01:24:51,203 --> 01:24:52,288
Now...

833
01:24:53,872 --> 01:24:55,708
and for the last time...

834
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:58,210
l ask you...

835
01:24:59,712 --> 01:25:02,089
if that man is your husband.

836
01:25:02,589 --> 01:25:05,092
Yes, I'm sure.

837
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:11,015
How can you be absolutely certain?

838
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:15,060
Speak. We are here to learn all.

839
01:25:23,235 --> 01:25:25,237
On his return, he knew all about me.

840
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,911
Did he know intimate details,

841
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:35,122
only a husband could know?

842
01:25:44,757 --> 01:25:45,924
What?

843
01:25:47,134 --> 01:25:48,302
What details?

844
01:25:55,309 --> 01:25:58,103
He knew when I wanted him...

845
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:01,106
and the words to say...

846
01:26:01,648 --> 01:26:02,691
before...

847
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:05,486
during... and after.

848
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,203
The Court...

849
01:26:14,995 --> 01:26:18,707
will now retire to deliberate.

850
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:29,676
I think that does it.

851
01:26:32,304 --> 01:26:35,641
This peasant seems
to have won his case.

852
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:37,142
He's Martin Guerre.

853
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:40,187
It would be inhuman not to free him.

854
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:42,189
We'll clear his name.

855
01:26:43,315 --> 01:26:46,693
Could anyone else
have defended him better?

856
01:27:32,364 --> 01:27:35,784
In the name of the King
and of his justice...

857
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,245
this Parliament...

858
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:39,580
Mr. President!

859
01:27:40,038 --> 01:27:41,582
...hereby declares

860
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,877
that the accused is indeed...

861
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,798
is indeed Martin...

862
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,638
One moment, gentlemen.

863
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:01,810
A new witness insists on being heard.

864
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,731
Have him come forward.

865
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:57,616
You claim to be Martin Guerre?

866
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:00,285
Yes, that's my name.

867
01:29:02,287 --> 01:29:03,539
Silence!

868
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:07,709
Stay where you are!

869
01:29:11,171 --> 01:29:12,464
Where were you?

870
01:29:12,965 --> 01:29:14,633
In Picardy. The Army.

871
01:29:16,635 --> 01:29:18,971
I lost my leg at Saint-Quentin.

872
01:29:19,471 --> 01:29:23,392
Back in Artigat,
I heard what was happening.

873
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:24,810
Here I am.

874
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,063
Do you know that man?

875
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,694
We soldiered together.

876
01:29:33,819 --> 01:29:36,321
Do you know his name?

877
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:39,283
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette.

878
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,577
Don't listen! Look at them...

879
01:29:41,702 --> 01:29:44,329
Having lost, they try a last ruse!

880
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:47,332
A beggar, hired by my uncle!

881
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:54,506
Do you know that woman?

882
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:05,058
Bertrande, my wife.

883
01:30:05,183 --> 01:30:07,436
It's one last low trick!

884
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,396
Accused, stay in your seat!

885
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:14,026
You wrong me and you insult me?

886
01:30:15,027 --> 01:30:16,361
Wrong you?

887
01:30:17,195 --> 01:30:19,740
I've never laid eyes on you!

888
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:24,911
Why don't you arrest him?
He's a hired liar!

889
01:30:25,037 --> 01:30:26,747
Silence, both of you.

890
01:30:27,372 --> 01:30:29,207
Pierre Guerre, step forward.

891
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:30,792
You and your wife.

892
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,430
Do you know this man?

893
01:30:45,557 --> 01:30:46,558
Yes...

894
01:30:48,226 --> 01:30:49,728
Yes, I recognize him.

895
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:52,773
Martin, my nephew.

896
01:30:55,442 --> 01:30:57,235
Let me embrace you, Martin.

897
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:01,657
At last you're back.

898
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:04,451
You're quite sure?

899
01:31:05,452 --> 01:31:07,579
He's my brother's son.

900
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:09,748
And you?

901
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:14,419
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God.

902
01:31:15,253 --> 01:31:16,463
Arrest him!

903
01:31:16,922 --> 01:31:18,465
Stay seated!

904
01:31:20,801 --> 01:31:23,303
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...

905
01:31:23,428 --> 01:31:25,806
just in time, like a miracle!

906
01:31:25,931 --> 01:31:26,973
It's God's doing.

907
01:31:28,266 --> 01:31:31,478
The hand of God, manifesting itself!

908
01:31:31,603 --> 01:31:33,146
It's divine justice.

909
01:31:33,271 --> 01:31:35,148
God has sent him

910
01:31:35,273 --> 01:31:36,650
to prevent injustice!

911
01:31:41,446 --> 01:31:43,699
To your seats!
Return to your seats!

912
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:56,628
Don't forsake me!

913
01:31:58,964 --> 01:32:01,216
It's a plot against me.

914
01:32:02,467 --> 01:32:04,219
In my own family!

915
01:32:04,803 --> 01:32:06,346
You sir, above all.

916
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:10,392
Please listen to me once more

917
01:32:10,517 --> 01:32:11,852
or else I'm lost.

918
01:32:12,477 --> 01:32:15,313
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat.

919
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:17,607
He's a paid liar.

920
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:22,028
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him.

921
01:32:23,655 --> 01:32:25,907
Let me put him to the test!

922
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:33,373
Do it.

923
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:41,715
You claim to be me. Tell me...

924
01:32:43,008 --> 01:32:44,551
On my wedding night

925
01:32:45,677 --> 01:32:48,263
who gave us the nuptial bowl?

926
01:32:55,771 --> 01:32:56,521
She did.

927
01:32:57,397 --> 01:32:59,566
Catherine. She tucked us in.

928
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:04,696
I was bewitched.
How many masses were said for me?

929
01:33:08,575 --> 01:33:11,536
It's so long ago and I'm tired.

930
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:18,543
Answer!

931
01:33:19,586 --> 01:33:22,589
- Six...
- He's wrong!

932
01:33:22,714 --> 01:33:24,424
He doesn't know!

933
01:33:24,549 --> 01:33:26,051
Not six... four!

934
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:28,553
Answer, you know.

935
01:33:28,887 --> 01:33:30,722
Tell the truth before God.

936
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:33,767
I said four masses, it's true.

937
01:33:40,899 --> 01:33:43,944
You should have been better informed.

938
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:47,614
Where was the spell broken?

939
01:33:47,906 --> 01:33:49,407
At the priest's.

940
01:33:50,742 --> 01:33:52,619
Was it hot or cold?

941
01:33:52,744 --> 01:33:54,120
Cold... I was naked.

942
01:33:54,579 --> 01:33:57,833
That's true! I was naked.

943
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:00,460
We warmed up quickly!

944
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:09,594
Who bought the sacks of grain I stole?

945
01:34:11,972 --> 01:34:13,014
Smallpox André.

946
01:34:13,682 --> 01:34:15,767
You learned that lesson well...

947
01:34:20,188 --> 01:34:21,606
Another thing...

948
01:34:21,982 --> 01:34:26,194
When I went away, what did I leave
in the linen-chest upstairs?

949
01:34:27,988 --> 01:34:29,823
What did I leave?

950
01:34:29,948 --> 01:34:32,200
I left it! What was it?

951
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,709
White breeches!

952
01:34:40,834 --> 01:34:42,752
Sewn by Bertrande.

953
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:44,170
And you didn't know.

954
01:34:44,671 --> 01:34:46,882
- I told you about them!
- I told you!

955
01:34:47,007 --> 01:34:48,884
Don't twist it around!

956
01:34:49,009 --> 01:34:50,343
Arrest him!

957
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:52,679
I've proven I'm Martin Guerre!

958
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:54,681
One moment.

959
01:34:55,807 --> 01:34:57,517
You say you told him?

960
01:34:57,642 --> 01:34:59,853
And he's trying to use it!

961
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:01,980
But before you said...

962
01:35:02,647 --> 01:35:04,524
you didn't know him.

963
01:35:14,701 --> 01:35:16,161
Accused, sit down.

964
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:22,500
The sisters, come here.

965
01:35:32,886 --> 01:35:35,931
Which one is your brother?

966
01:35:37,515 --> 01:35:39,351
Make up your minds.

967
01:35:49,694 --> 01:35:51,196
This is my brother.

968
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:55,742
It's Martin Guerre.

969
01:35:55,867 --> 01:35:58,244
No, you're making a mistake!

970
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:59,871
And you, Guillemette?

971
01:36:02,248 --> 01:36:03,708
What do you say?

972
01:36:04,876 --> 01:36:06,711
I can't remember.

973
01:36:07,253 --> 01:36:08,755
I was too little.

974
01:36:09,923 --> 01:36:11,883
Maybe it's him.

975
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:13,593
He's my father!

976
01:36:13,718 --> 01:36:17,889
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!

977
01:36:18,014 --> 01:36:19,391
Silence!

978
01:36:19,766 --> 01:36:21,726
I order you to be quiet!

979
01:36:24,229 --> 01:36:26,982
Catherine Boére, come here.

980
01:36:30,568 --> 01:36:31,945
What do you say?

981
01:36:32,404 --> 01:36:33,446
Me?

982
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:35,156
Yes, you. What do you say?

983
01:36:35,281 --> 01:36:36,741
Of no importance...

984
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:38,827
I'm not family.

985
01:36:38,952 --> 01:36:41,621
Catherine... Tell them.

986
01:37:20,618 --> 01:37:22,287
Forgive me, Martin.

987
01:37:23,788 --> 01:37:26,791
Don't cry...
Women cry easily.

988
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:30,795
You should have known
your own husband.

989
01:37:32,881 --> 01:37:34,841
Our house is dishonoured.

990
01:37:35,842 --> 01:37:37,469
It's all your fault.

991
01:37:41,473 --> 01:37:43,808
You're to blame, Martin.

992
01:37:48,897 --> 01:37:51,191
You betrayed my friendship.

993
01:37:52,817 --> 01:37:54,360
You deserve no pity.

994
01:38:00,992 --> 01:38:05,163
What harm in caring for a woman
her husband deserted?

995
01:38:09,834 --> 01:38:11,836
We await your confession...

996
01:38:13,004 --> 01:38:14,506
Arnaud of Tihl.

997
01:38:22,847 --> 01:38:24,099
It's true.

998
01:38:26,893 --> 01:38:28,686
We soldiered together.

999
01:38:32,524 --> 01:38:34,859
He talked about his wife...

1000
01:38:35,193 --> 01:38:37,112
his son, his house...

1001
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:41,741
One day on the road,
two men took me for him

1002
01:38:41,866 --> 01:38:43,910
They called me Martin.

1003
01:38:44,619 --> 01:38:46,121
It gave me an idea.

1004
01:38:47,038 --> 01:38:48,123
I thought...

1005
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:54,420
Why not take his place?

1006
01:39:00,885 --> 01:39:02,929
So I learned all I could.

1007
01:39:03,555 --> 01:39:05,890
Martin said he wasn't coming back.

1008
01:39:08,059 --> 01:39:10,061
I went to Artigat,

1009
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:11,938
I was taken for him.

1010
01:39:16,901 --> 01:39:18,444
I almost told them:

1011
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:21,906
"I fooled you! Martin's up north!"

1012
01:39:22,282 --> 01:39:23,950
I almost said it.

1013
01:39:28,955 --> 01:39:29,914
Then I saw you.

1014
01:39:34,294 --> 01:39:35,920
I took you in my arms.

1015
01:39:39,591 --> 01:39:41,593
Next day, it was too late.

1016
01:39:45,013 --> 01:39:48,266
After that,
I learned whatever I didn't know

1017
01:39:48,516 --> 01:39:51,603
from my uncle, sisters, wife.

1018
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:55,106
And I remembered it.

1019
01:40:06,993 --> 01:40:08,995
There's no magic in it.

1020
01:40:11,164 --> 01:40:12,290
I swear it.

1021
01:40:21,925 --> 01:40:24,135
You don't deserve her.

1022
01:40:25,178 --> 01:40:27,180
I know her better than you do.

1023
01:40:36,981 --> 01:40:39,192
I ask you all to forgive me.

1024
01:40:39,984 --> 01:40:41,194
You.

1025
01:40:42,528 --> 01:40:43,821
Them.

1026
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:48,159
And you...

1027
01:40:49,827 --> 01:40:51,371
who were my wife.

1028
01:41:10,348 --> 01:41:12,684
Your men can stay in the barn.

1029
01:41:13,309 --> 01:41:17,272
Pierre Guerre,
you brought discord to this village.

1030
01:41:17,563 --> 01:41:19,774
Now keep the peace.

1031
01:41:33,871 --> 01:41:35,248
Leave us, please.

1032
01:42:06,738 --> 01:42:08,072
I'm thirsty.

1033
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:26,841
You have dared much
and feared God very little.

1034
01:42:30,428 --> 01:42:33,931
We hesitated
before declaring you innocent.

1035
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:40,980
It was unwise
to take that stranger into your bed.

1036
01:42:43,358 --> 01:42:45,693
Women are often the victims

1037
01:42:45,818 --> 01:42:47,445
of men's wickedness.

1038
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:56,454
That's why we acquitted you.

1039
01:42:58,373 --> 01:43:00,166
And legitimated...

1040
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:02,877
your daughter's birth.

1041
01:43:03,669 --> 01:43:05,171
We hope that now...

1042
01:43:06,672 --> 01:43:09,008
you will be a good wife.

1043
01:43:11,803 --> 01:43:14,555
But tell me, between us...

1044
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:16,641
so I'll understand...

1045
01:43:22,313 --> 01:43:24,857
Before Arnaud appeared,

1046
01:43:24,982 --> 01:43:26,901
you needed a man?

1047
01:43:30,696 --> 01:43:33,032
And this one pleased you?

1048
01:43:36,828 --> 01:43:40,248
Did he satisfy your need?

1049
01:43:45,169 --> 01:43:46,838
You loved each other?

1050
01:43:51,843 --> 01:43:54,345
You knew from the start?

1051
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:56,848
You can tell me.

1052
01:43:57,348 --> 01:43:59,183
It will go no farther.

1053
01:44:05,356 --> 01:44:06,774
Arnaud and I...

1054
01:44:10,027 --> 01:44:11,737
were good together.

1055
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,201
Martin had neglected me.

1056
01:44:19,203 --> 01:44:21,038
Arnaud respected me...

1057
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,041
like a true husband.

1058
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:28,087
I trusted him completely.

1059
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:35,761
We thought of asking to be judged.

1060
01:44:37,388 --> 01:44:39,307
We could have won.

1061
01:44:45,229 --> 01:44:48,816
If Martin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife.

1062
01:44:50,276 --> 01:44:52,278
No one could've denied it.

1063
01:44:54,113 --> 01:44:55,448
At the last minute...

1064
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,825
Why did you change?

1065
01:45:00,328 --> 01:45:01,996
Why choose Martin?

1066
01:45:09,253 --> 01:45:11,005
In Arnaud's eyes...

1067
01:45:15,092 --> 01:45:17,136
I saw it was hopeless.

1068
01:45:21,849 --> 01:45:23,768
I saw what he wanted.

1069
01:45:33,277 --> 01:45:35,112
He wanted me to live...

1070
01:45:36,656 --> 01:45:38,282
for me and my children.

1071
01:45:41,285 --> 01:45:42,954
So I did it.

1072
01:46:06,477 --> 01:46:09,313
God forgive me, I defiled marriage.

1073
01:46:09,564 --> 01:46:12,316
The King, the law,

1074
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,819
all those I offended...

1075
01:46:17,321 --> 01:46:18,322
forgive me.

1076
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:23,995
Stand up, Arnaud.

1077
01:46:42,722 --> 01:46:43,931
Guards!

1078
01:46:44,348 --> 01:46:45,725
Open the door.

1079
01:47:12,418 --> 01:47:13,586
God forgive me,

1080
01:47:14,128 --> 01:47:16,422
I defiled marriage.

1081
01:47:17,048 --> 01:47:20,384
The King, the law...

1082
01:47:21,385 --> 01:47:23,929
all those I offended, forgive me.

1083
01:48:34,667 --> 01:48:36,669
Commend your soul to God.

1084
01:48:55,229 --> 01:48:58,733
The story of the false Martin Guerre

1085
01:48:58,858 --> 01:49:00,901
ended that morning.

1086
01:49:02,486 --> 01:49:06,365
The Councillor, Jean of Coras,
impressed

1087
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:10,661
by this daring imposture,
made a record of it.

1088
01:49:11,662 --> 01:49:13,164
12 years later...

1089
01:49:13,998 --> 01:49:16,250
came the St Bartholomew Massacre.

1090
01:49:16,917 --> 01:49:19,378
For his Protestant beliefs,

1091
01:49:19,503 --> 01:49:23,716
Jean de Coras was hanged
before the Toulouse Parliament

1092
01:49:24,258 --> 01:49:26,177
with a hundred of his friends.

1093
01:49:28,554 --> 01:49:31,348
But we live only by the spirit.

1094
01:49:32,516 --> 01:49:34,268
All else dies.
