00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:36,509
THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE

2
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:58,955
On this St. Michael's Sunday
in the church of Artigat...

3
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,658
...we receive
Bertrande de Rols...

4
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,937
...daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols and of...

5
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,040
...Raimonde, his wife

6
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,908
And we receive Martin Guerre...

7
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:13,340
...son of Mathurin Guerre...

8
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,639
and of his wife, Brigitte,

9
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,249
Martin wishes to take Bertrande
for wife...

10
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,749
and keep her all his life

11
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,504
I, Martin, give my body to thee,
Bertrande

12
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:49,209
I accept it and give my body
to thee, Martin

13
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:57,384
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony

14
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:04,925
You will not regret
having followed this story...

15
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:09,131
...for it is not a tale
of adventure...

16
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,236
...nor an imaginary fable

17
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:15,339
It is a true story

18
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:22,278
It began one August Sunday,
in 1542...

19
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,013
...in the village of Artigat,
county of Foix...

20
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,279
...in the reign of Francis I

21
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,552
Bertrande, at her parents'
decision...

22
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:41,098
...brings a dowry of 30 acres
of wheat...

23
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,629
...and 40 of millet, at the place
called Pomarede

24
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,698
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods...

25
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:54,775
...inherited from her father
Laurent, deceased

26
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:03,585
Three dresses, one bed,
one linen-chest with lock and key

27
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,352
That's all

28
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,324
Catherine... something to drink

29
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,599
If you still agree, sign here

30
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:31,143
Seraphin, you will have
to blow harder, boy!

31
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,394
It's a good match... well
arranged

32
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,365
May the Lord bless
this bed with health...

33
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,413
...and keep the Demon
from this house

34
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:05,716
Kiss her, Father

35
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:15,552
Martin, tender buds need
to be sprinkled at night!

36
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,957
You two... kiss your brother

37
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:26,472
Make us some pretty
grandchildren!

38
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,446
The rest... you can do without me

39
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,820
Whenever you want,
come eat and dance.

40
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,764
This is Bertrande de Rols

41
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,543
You say at first
your husband couldn't...

42
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:23,349
...consummate your marriage.
Why not?

43
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:27,716
Because of the spell
that had been cast on him

44
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:33,093
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?

45
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,197
Yes... but I didn't

46
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:44,166
I was married...
I felt bound to him

47
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:46,878
People knew?

48
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,777
Of course... We had no children

49
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,942
They made fun of him?

50
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:55,281
Yes... the whole village

51
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:01,349
Tell me what happened that
Candlemas Day

52
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,231
If you're tired of sleeping
at night, change husbands!

53
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:27,038
Change husbands
if you want to have children!

54
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,073
Stop trembling, boy

55
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,083
It's caused by evil thoughts

56
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,422
They put a spell on you

57
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,225
I'll take it away

58
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,407
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you

59
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:38,446
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you

60
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,651
Blessed Flesh,
I make you grow again

61
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:50,229
Accursed Demon, leave
this servant of the Lord

62
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:54,224
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin...

63
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,334
...whose flesh is suffering

64
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:05,734
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Bertrande...

65
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,210
...whose flesh is suffering

66
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:15,778
And put in all your heart.

67
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,720
Don't be afraid

68
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,493
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament

69
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,365
I am now in charge
of this matter

70
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:45,316
You must tell me everything,
even if the priest said not to

71
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:51,654
And that worked?

72
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,924
That very day... yes

73
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,325
We had a son... his name is Sanxi

74
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:05,394
So all was well

75
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:09,140
For me, yes, but Martin...

76
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,446
Martin kept to himself

77
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:17,706
He didn't even look at our son

78
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,249
He didn't like farming

79
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,547
He and his father argued

80
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,700
You want us to die of thirst?

81
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,012
Where were you?

82
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,653
You can't do anything right!

83
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,190
Iwas with some soldiers,
at the stream

84
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,105
2 sacks of grain are gone...
You seen them?

85
00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:58,848
You stole them

86
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,613
You loaded the grain...
You stole them!

87
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:05,917
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!

88
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,716
I’ll make you hate the
taste of bread!

89
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:12,526
Ididn't take them!
- While I'm alive...

90
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,293
...I'm the master here!

91
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:33,311
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?

92
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:37,856
Wear them Sunday

93
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:45,488
You cut them too big.
You wasted your time

94
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,929
You always scold me

95
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:57,770
It's not my fault

96
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:01,043
Be nice sometimes

97
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,724
That was the night he left

98
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,926
Why steal the grain?

99
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:27,033
Did he know he was leaving?

100
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,768
And needed money?

101
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:31,273
Maybe... I don't know

102
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,079
He didn't talk to me much

103
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:41,752
What did you think?

104
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,652
That he'd be back soon

105
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,226
Everyone thought so

106
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:53,095
That his father had scared him

107
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,334
He waited for Martin
every day for months

108
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,733
Finally he died...
killed by sorrow

109
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,602
Martin's mother died
a year later

110
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:10,145
So Melusine married a prince...

111
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,051
...and all her sons
became kings

112
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:19,754
But one Saturday,
her husband couldn't resist

113
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:24,959
He peeked through the keyhole...

114
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:28,900
...and saw she was a mermaid...

115
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:33,537
...with scales on her body,
and wings on her back

116
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:48,212
Some people believe
she comes back every day...

117
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,753
...secretly, to feed the children

118
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:55,355
And I believe it, too

119
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,259
She couldn't desert them

120
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,331
Your mother got married again?

121
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:15,178
Yes... to Pierre Guerre,
my husband's uncle

122
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,549
To keep the farms together?

123
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:20,780
No doubt

124
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:24,081
Our lands are now held in common

125
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,835
The wolves are out tonight

126
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,869
Make sure the animals
are locked up

127
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,706
Yes, mother...
I do it every night

128
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:02,885
Dirty beast!

129
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,052
Did Martin stay away long?

130
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,786
Eight winters... or nine

131
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:13,563
You never heard from him?

132
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,760
No... nothing

133
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:20,836
But I'm sure you had
no lack of admirers

134
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,900
No... but I kept my virtue

135
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,067
Speak up, we can't hear you

136
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,673
I kept my virtue

137
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,906
Ask anyone... I remained chaste

138
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,980
You never forgot Martin?

139
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,417
Iprayed to St. Catherine
to send him back

140
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,090
So many seasons passed...

141
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,737
Then she heard me.

142
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:34,670
Who are you?

143
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:38,777
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?

144
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,108
Who are you?

145
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,318
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely!

146
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,461
Do I know you?
- I think you do

147
00:20:56,135 --> 00:21:02,199
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?

148
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,209
Is it you, Martin?

149
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,949
You're back!

150
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,521
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son

151
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,424
No, Jacques is my brother

152
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:29,523
Right... you're "Smallpox Andre"

153
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:45,212
Remember the bear hunt,
when Nicolas "castrated" me?

154
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,480
Made me miserable, didn't you?

155
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:52,781
Martin Guerre is back!

156
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:55,592
You're bigger, Martin

157
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:57,854
War does that

158
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:05,932
Martin Guerre is back!

159
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,596
You've seen him?

160
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,469
Yes! He's down the road

161
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,219
Guillemette... your brother!

162
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:30,759
Are you sure?
- I saw him!

163
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,934
Bertrande, your husband's back!

164
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,472
Come... it's your husband!

165
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,229
You still here?

166
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:19,476
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!

167
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,831
Hello Jeanne... sister

168
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,663
Martin... at last!

169
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,033
You've changed!

170
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,673
Where's your husband?

171
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:05,215
Are you Guillemette?

172
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,796
You were so small when I left!

173
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,062
Come kiss your brother

174
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:26,973
Sanxi?

175
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:34,080
You're so big

176
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:37,588
Don't be afraid

177
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:40,920
Come nearer

178
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:43,418
I'm your father

179
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:06,273
Hello, Uncle

180
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:10,286
You were gone a long time

181
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,487
That's true

182
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,225
Forgive me for what I did

183
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:26,130
Your father and mother are dead

184
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,708
I heard, and I prayed for them

185
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,912
I also heard you
married Raimonde...

186
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,280
...my wife's mother

187
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,548
It's good news

188
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,916
My daughter has suffered

189
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,423
Have you changed for the better?

190
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:04,040
You're here... it's all true!

191
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:08,339
Is it really you?

192
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:18,522
Is that you, Catherine?

193
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,492
You haven't changed

194
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:31,935
I wondered if you'd ever
come back

195
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,735
And here you are, safe and sound

196
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:59,224
Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house

197
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:00,831
She's waiting for you

198
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,473
It's me, hello

199
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:07,964
It's me... Martin

200
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,618
Hello, Martin

201
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,938
My God, my wife is beautiful!

202
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,443
It is a gift of God
that you have returned

203
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,559
He was in the Army in Picardy

204
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,801
Don't you recognize me?

205
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,407
Who are you?

206
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:01,203
It's me... Nicolas

207
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:15,554
It's confusing, seeing you all

208
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:26,068
I forgot about the bear long ago

209
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:28,301
I've seen worse

210
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,641
Here's cloth from Flanders

211
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,510
The nicest for Bertrande,
with lace

212
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:26,155
Catherine, take the last one

213
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:46,381
You've learned to read?

214
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,185
And to write, too

215
00:31:57,596 --> 00:31:58,790
To write?

216
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:13,775
What did you do all this time?

217
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,781
Ifought in the war

218
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:25,585
I even went to Spain

219
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,897
Then I wanted to see you

220
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:44,768
All of you

221
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:46,705
What's Spain like?

222
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,577
It's dry

223
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,913
And Paris? Did you see Paris?

224
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:58,815
It's big...
There are people everywhere

225
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,317
I even got lost there

226
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,399
There are thieves at night

227
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,935
You're so strong now, Martin!

228
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,972
Iknew my brother would come back

229
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,415
This calls for a celebration!

230
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,119
When you left here, Martin...

231
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:36,219
...you didn't have a beard yet

232
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:38,896
And you didn't drink as much

233
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,428
Now I drink like a monk!

234
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,596
After war... peace!

235
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,169
To you, my wife

236
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,379
A little rough... but not bad

237
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,315
Just enough to kill the worms!

238
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:27,301
I’ll prepare your bed

239
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,981
It's good to be on your own land

240
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:44,652
What are you looking for?

241
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:46,923
The candles

242
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:48,463
In there

243
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:50,965
You moved them?

244
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,236
No, they've always been there

245
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:58,768
Then I forgot

246
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:28,405
She cried a lot because of you

247
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,383
Remember, Bertrande?

248
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:42,615
Go get my white breeches...

249
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,719
...the ones lined with silk...

250
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,923
...from the linen-chest

251
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:54,564
If they're still there

252
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:02,605
I'll go

253
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,841
You've found your smile

254
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:30,156
"The bird's back in the nest,
Tonight they will not rest"

255
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:55,053
They're still there

256
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:59,524
Waiting for you... like me

257
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,541
I'll wear them tomorrow

258
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,151
How often I've wanted you

259
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:15,363
I'm here only because of you

260
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:50,470
So everyone recognized him?

261
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,566
Yes... everyone

262
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:56,308
His sisters, his uncle...

263
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:59,213
...Catherine, the servant?

264
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:01,111
His friends... the whole village

265
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:05,055
You too?

266
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,690
Me too

267
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:10,756
Without hesitation?

268
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,062
Then what?

269
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:23,072
He took up his work,
his place at home

270
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,840
We had two children.
The first died...

271
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,407
...the second is alive:
A girl, 18 months old

272
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:37,315
And everything went well?

273
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:38,978
Very well

274
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,014
Better than before?

275
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,323
Yes... and he worked hard

276
00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:48,861
Our harvests have never
been better

277
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:51,792
And between you two?

278
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:54,765
It's been good

279
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:00,940
When did the doubts first begin?

280
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:05,282
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn

281
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:34,469
A game for 15 points?

282
00:40:36,614 --> 00:40:38,275
Idon't gamble

283
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,686
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy relic?

284
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,790
Go to the devil,
we have a priest!

285
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:52,387
I’m going back

286
00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:59,232
I'll play

287
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:02,172
Dominique, play with me

288
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:05,072
No, I think not... like Martin

289
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:08,769
Come on Father... only 15 points

290
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,748
Who is he?

291
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:24,623
Martin Guerre, who went away
and came back

292
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:27,393
Like the prodigal son

293
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:29,494
He's not Martin Guerre!

294
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,128
Iknew Martin Guerre

295
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,034
At the battle of St. Quentin

296
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:41,167
In fact, he lost a leg there

297
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:44,439
Of course it's Martin

298
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,947
I ought to know...
I'm the one who married him

299
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:51,520
But it's not! He's...

300
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,623
What's his name again?

301
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:01,823
Iknew him in the Army, too.

302
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,134
It is Martin...
we're even related!

303
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,865
Itell you he's not Martin

304
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:13,002
He's Pansette!

305
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:15,805
That's it... Pansette

306
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:22,451
He's from the village of Tihl

307
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,147
I knew him in Picardy, too

308
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,318
What's he doing here?

309
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:33,061
Isaw two of those people
in Arras

310
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,863
From a land called Brazil

311
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:44,737
Their bodies were all painted

312
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:51,237
They had feathers on their
heads... It's true, Sanxi

313
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:58,717
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us

314
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:08,153
They were in chains,
and made to dance

315
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:18,373
In their own country,
they go naked

316
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:21,634
Even the women?

317
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,311
Sounds like a nice country

318
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,009
Then you should go there

319
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:37,319
They eat their prisoner's hearts

320
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,562
And the prisoners consider it
a worthy death

321
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:50,032
Are they human?
Do they have a soul?

322
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:52,973
The monks say they do

323
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:02,383
In some tribes, they share
their land and their women

324
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:07,748
In others, the women go to war
and make all the decisions

325
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:18,098
The day women rule here,
it'll be the end of the world

326
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:37,186
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind

327
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:13,383
No... Let's go home, I'm afraid

328
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,154
Why?

329
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,634
See? A circle of smoke...

330
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:29,635
Spirits will be out...
We mustn't look at them

331
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:49,522
Pansette! What are you doing?

332
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:52,559
Leaving us already?

333
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:57,626
Trying to find your way?

334
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:01,598
When are you going?

335
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:05,435
Did you come to
the wrong village?

336
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:19,646
Imight've known it was you,
you snake!

337
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:28,525
He's strong! Not like Martin...
right, Bertrande?

338
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,901
Pansette, you look true
but you play false

339
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:35,803
Beware!

340
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:47,545
Where was this soldier from?

341
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:50,347
A garrison in Picardy

342
00:46:57,561 --> 00:47:00,155
Don't believe tales told
by strangers...

343
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:03,055
...and by drunks

344
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:06,069
Or by rogues!

345
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:11,506
He's right

346
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,609
"Lies come easy from afar"

347
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:24,187
We know Martin well

348
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:51,612
If anyone knows Martin...

349
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:54,650
...it's us

350
00:48:57,815 --> 00:48:59,806
We must do our accounts one day

351
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,816
How much my land earned
in my absence

352
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:06,612
What do you mean?

353
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:12,328
You worked my land and I'm
grateful... but it made a profit

354
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:14,296
Now I need the money

355
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:18,357
I figure it's about 6000 livres

356
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:25,538
You dare ask me
for an accounting?

357
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:31,904
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?

358
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,011
I, who protected your wife?

359
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:39,611
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?

360
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,092
It was your duty! Iwent
to war... I've a right to it!

361
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,126
You have no rights... you left!

362
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:49,198
Yes, I have!
Ihave the law on my side

363
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,802
I'll seek justice, if I must

364
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,570
You'll be condemned

365
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:58,602
You threaten your uncle?

366
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,672
Ineed that money!

367
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,944
I’ll sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pusol's...

368
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,381
...to plant barley

369
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:21,696
You want to sell
your father's field?

370
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,765
It's too steep for planting

371
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:29,202
You're starting to squander
our property!

372
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,302
But I expected it

373
00:50:32,977 --> 00:50:34,842
I'm not surprised

374
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:37,840
I warn you...

375
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:41,513
...Martin or not Martin

376
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:44,586
...you won't get away with it!

377
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:45,949
What did you say?

378
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:48,749
Repeat that!

379
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:17,343
So Bertrande, you have
doubts too?

380
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,983
Know what they're saying?

381
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:27,330
You know that if this man
isn't your husband...

382
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:33,727
...you've been living in
mortal sin for three years

383
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:38,675
You know that
you're damning your soul

384
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:43,938
You'll follow him into
the depths of Hell

385
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:47,378
Your flesh will burn

386
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:51,548
Your eyes will fall
into the flames

387
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:57,290
You will scream but
no one will hear

388
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:04,826
An eternity of suffering
awaits you, Bertrande

389
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,633
Aren't you afraid to lie to God?

390
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:12,408
If you have doubts, why haven't
you told me, in confession?

391
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,272
You aren't hiding anything
from me?

392
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,809
Beware, Bertrande...

393
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,885
...of the day when the dead
come for the living...

394
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:25,412
...the Day of Judgment!

395
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:33,019
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too

396
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:35,387
The whole village did

397
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,594
You all welcomed him

398
00:52:40,504 --> 00:52:41,994
Look at Bertrande

399
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:45,399
She's not complaining

400
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,203
She's never looked better

401
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:51,845
He'd been gone a long time

402
00:52:57,121 --> 00:52:59,214
What if we were all mistaken?

403
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:04,117
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?

404
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:08,329
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief

405
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:11,858
You're right to stand up to him

406
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,432
I ask you again...

407
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:21,143
...what if it's not him?

408
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,612
You be careful, too.

409
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:33,522
After me, it'll be your turn

410
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:39,352
He'll wipe your ass
and take your shirt!

411
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,057
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again

412
00:53:47,704 --> 00:53:49,695
Leaving you your eyes to cry with

413
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:53,068
Then you'll see what kind
of man he is!

414
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:09,016
The work isn't finished!

415
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:14,296
I’m ashamed for you, Uncle

416
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,462
My father wants you

417
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:48,958
I'm coming

418
00:55:05,716 --> 00:55:07,274
What do you want?

419
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:09,783
I’ve thought it over

420
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:14,584
You're right... I have the money

421
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:18,184
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you

422
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:21,324
I don't want any trouble

423
00:55:28,305 --> 00:55:30,603
Know where your father hid money?

424
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:37,112
No, he never told me

425
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:42,111
In the hay-loft above the stable

426
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:55,059
I'll wait for you there
at cock's crow

427
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:57,390
I'll give you your due

428
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:09,170
But let's keep it to ourselves

429
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:40,570
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales

430
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,539
They're all jealous

431
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,511
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar

432
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:51,242
All they talk about is us

433
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:56,250
Calm down, my uncle has
understood... He'll shut them up

434
00:56:57,925 --> 00:56:58,983
Give me your hand

435
00:57:11,939 --> 00:57:13,338
Let me guide you

436
00:57:27,688 --> 00:57:29,485
Is that her name?

437
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:34,059
Yes, that's my name

438
00:57:59,687 --> 00:58:02,520
It's in the grain chest

439
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,270
You wanted it, right?

440
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:21,139
You wanted what we owe you?

441
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:24,602
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...

442
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:26,873
...in hard cash!

443
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,851
You won't ask for it again!

444
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:39,019
At your service, Pansette!

445
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:42,623
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!

446
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:50,134
Go on, Antoine,
or I'll disinherit you!

447
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,654
You were ready to die for him?

448
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:11,748
Yes, to protect him

449
00:59:14,462 --> 00:59:16,123
Explain something to me

450
00:59:17,498 --> 00:59:21,867
You defended your husband,
risking your own life

451
00:59:22,736 --> 00:59:25,500
But when his uncle
attacked him legally...

452
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,933
...you didn't say anything

453
00:59:28,776 --> 00:59:30,175
You should've protested

454
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:34,008
Talked to the judge

455
00:59:34,548 --> 00:59:37,016
Told everyone:
I know he's my husband

456
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:40,913
But you said nothing

457
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:45,853
Why?

458
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:54,562
Did you have doubts, too?

459
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:59,037
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?

460
01:00:02,643 --> 01:00:04,873
At one moment, I was troubled

461
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:08,412
I wavered

462
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:11,077
I thought...

463
01:00:11,252 --> 01:00:12,549
Speak up

464
01:00:13,888 --> 01:00:16,584
I thought: Maybe
he's fooling me, too

465
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:21,461
Charming me, as he did others

466
01:00:23,564 --> 01:00:25,964
Then my daughter is a bastard

467
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:31,537
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell

468
01:00:33,741 --> 01:00:36,437
Yes... I had doubts

469
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:39,437
And still have?

470
01:00:41,682 --> 01:00:43,616
No, not any more

471
01:00:43,884 --> 01:00:45,442
Then he is your husband

472
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:48,346
Yes or no?

473
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:52,214
I say yes

474
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,630
And what does he say?

475
01:01:01,802 --> 01:01:03,736
The same thing, obviously

476
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:05,667
He says they're man and wife

477
01:01:06,106 --> 01:01:09,769
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament

478
01:01:10,411 --> 01:01:12,641
They're all here

479
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:15,445
Come with us

480
01:01:35,135 --> 01:01:36,625
Go join your family

481
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:42,273
You are Martin Guerre?

482
01:01:43,677 --> 01:01:44,974
Yes, I am

483
01:01:46,614 --> 01:01:48,104
You're quite sure?

484
01:01:49,016 --> 01:01:50,984
I don't know of any other

485
01:02:10,537 --> 01:02:12,437
You're going to pay!

486
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:14,972
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!

487
01:02:15,142 --> 01:02:17,542
The law will punish you,
you cheat!

488
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:20,509
You tricked us,
to steal our property

489
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:23,548
Slander! To avoid paying
what you owe me!

490
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:27,084
I owe you nothing!
You're not my nephew!

491
01:02:27,588 --> 01:02:31,115
I am and you know it!
Everyone knows it!

492
01:02:32,393 --> 01:02:33,485
Eat your words!

493
01:02:38,265 --> 01:02:41,257
The family apart... over here

494
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:57,250
Now listen to me, all of you

495
01:02:59,486 --> 01:03:01,784
Those who honestly think...

496
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,253
...this man is not Martin Guerre,
to my left

497
01:03:29,717 --> 01:03:32,185
Those who honestly think...

498
01:03:33,087 --> 01:03:39,686
...he truly is Martin Guerre,
to my right

499
01:04:04,785 --> 01:04:06,047
And you?

500
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:12,851
I am their priest

501
01:04:14,995 --> 01:04:17,293
But surely you have an opinion

502
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:53,664
The others have no opinion?

503
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:04,842
In settlement of this dispute...

504
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:08,843
...I, Jean de Coras, Counselor
of the Toulouse Parliament...

505
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:12,477
...declare that there is
no reason...

506
01:05:12,653 --> 01:05:14,848
...to believe this man
is not Martin Guerre

507
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:19,589
The charge is dismissed
due to lack of proof

508
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:23,324
This man shall be released

509
01:05:24,698 --> 01:05:27,326
Pierre Guerre is condemned
to pay...

510
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:32,268
...500 livres to the King
and to his nephew, for calumny

511
01:05:46,486 --> 01:05:47,919
Free him

512
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:03,266
You are a knave! God knows it
and will punish you!

513
01:06:03,437 --> 01:06:06,702
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other

514
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,172
That was an excellent judgment

515
01:07:57,517 --> 01:07:59,451
What happened to my brother?

516
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:02,613
You should be in bed

517
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:32,347
On your feet!
This time we've got you

518
01:08:32,519 --> 01:08:34,043
Get dressed

519
01:08:34,688 --> 01:08:37,316
Get up, you're under arrest!

520
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:39,288
I was released yesterday!

521
01:08:40,494 --> 01:08:42,428
Things changed during the night

522
01:08:43,797 --> 01:08:50,464
This time your wife signed, too

523
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:04,845
Get dressed, you're going
to Toulouse

524
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:08,777
When did she sign?

525
01:09:09,222 --> 01:09:12,623
Last night, before going to bed

526
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:17,656
Is it true?

527
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:20,495
They made you sign?

528
01:09:25,072 --> 01:09:29,236
This time you're done for

529
01:10:08,381 --> 01:10:10,349
The accusation is the same

530
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:15,151
But it will be more difficult
to answer

531
01:10:16,356 --> 01:10:17,687
Your wife signed

532
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:19,155
It's a forgery

533
01:10:19,826 --> 01:10:23,318
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?

534
01:10:23,797 --> 01:10:25,822
Her uncle and cousins scare her

535
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:28,959
They might cut her throat

536
01:10:30,737 --> 01:10:32,329
They've threatened her?

537
01:10:34,908 --> 01:10:36,136
Often

538
01:10:38,545 --> 01:10:40,308
Especially lately

539
01:10:43,683 --> 01:10:46,174
She now says you betrayed her

540
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:49,755
That you're not her husband...
That's serious

541
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,850
I know her...
They forced her to sign.

542
01:10:56,096 --> 01:10:59,657
Assure her safety
and ask me what you want

543
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:01,800
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre

544
01:11:04,838 --> 01:11:07,204
We've heard many witnesses...

545
01:11:09,776 --> 01:11:11,767
...and we shall hear more

546
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:18,314
Shall a counselor defend you?

547
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:23,354
I don't need help to prove
who I am

548
01:11:24,758 --> 01:11:26,157
Who married you?

549
01:11:28,495 --> 01:11:31,362
Father Dominique Caylar...
he's still there

550
01:11:31,631 --> 01:11:34,065
He doesn't like me...
I swear a lot

551
01:11:35,802 --> 01:11:39,135
We married on St. Michael's day,
18 years ago

552
01:11:39,472 --> 01:11:40,962
Who was the notary?

553
01:11:44,377 --> 01:11:47,369
Jehan Pegala, from Fosset

554
01:11:51,818 --> 01:11:54,548
He was late, my father was upset

555
01:11:55,989 --> 01:11:59,891
Bertrande's dowry was the
Roussas woods...

556
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:04,359
...her lands at Pomarede
and two oxen...

557
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:08,199
...a bed with feather pillows...

558
01:12:10,203 --> 01:12:11,329
...and three dresses

559
01:12:11,571 --> 01:12:15,564
And sacks of grain,
have you forgotten?

560
01:12:21,014 --> 01:12:25,110
No... no sacks of grain

561
01:12:31,725 --> 01:12:37,994
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband

562
01:12:39,232 --> 01:12:41,496
That wasn't so before

563
01:12:43,436 --> 01:12:46,405
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left

564
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:48,568
And she's changed

565
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:52,601
So have I

566
01:12:57,484 --> 01:12:59,418
You're not stupid

567
01:13:09,763 --> 01:13:11,663
You know you risk death?

568
01:13:12,332 --> 01:13:14,800
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!

569
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:18,433
I was his nephew until
I wanted my money

570
01:13:18,605 --> 01:13:20,732
Everyone knew me: My sisters,
my wife's mother...

571
01:13:20,907 --> 01:13:23,740
...even my wife

572
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:26,242
Others also say you're not Martin

573
01:13:26,413 --> 01:13:27,971
My uncle's rich

574
01:13:28,748 --> 01:13:33,048
They're afraid of him!
He acts out of self-interest!

575
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:37,290
He'd rob me of my name
and my property!

576
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,588
It's outrageous!

577
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:42,189
Follow me

578
01:14:20,066 --> 01:14:24,002
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?

579
01:14:30,977 --> 01:14:33,241
You asked to see this man

580
01:14:40,053 --> 01:14:41,418
Do you know him?

581
01:14:49,329 --> 01:14:51,729
Yes... it's him

582
01:14:53,366 --> 01:14:54,890
Who is he?

583
01:14:56,469 --> 01:14:58,130
What's his name?

584
01:15:00,673 --> 01:15:02,800
It's Arnaud

585
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,078
They call him Pansette

586
01:15:16,923 --> 01:15:18,220
Where's he from?

587
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,623
Our village

588
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,792
He's from Tihl

589
01:15:24,964 --> 01:15:26,295
You're sure?

590
01:15:26,866 --> 01:15:30,233
He left a long time ago
but that's him

591
01:15:32,472 --> 01:15:34,599
Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?

592
01:15:34,774 --> 01:15:38,232
No... Arnaud, from Tihl

593
01:15:38,578 --> 01:15:40,443
Called Pansette

594
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:44,716
Look at them!

595
01:15:45,785 --> 01:15:49,346
They're sent by my uncle!

596
01:15:52,058 --> 01:15:54,049
Bought and paid for!

597
01:15:54,327 --> 01:15:57,819
Look at them...
shame written on their faces!

598
01:15:58,164 --> 01:16:01,258
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified

599
01:16:03,002 --> 01:16:06,460
So what? My uncle has influence

600
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,331
Why should I pretend?

601
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:12,478
To have a house and a wife

602
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,238
But it's my house and my wife!

603
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:19,647
I’m wronged... and I'm accused!

604
01:16:24,924 --> 01:16:27,620
Never was a husband so maligned!

605
01:16:27,794 --> 01:16:31,423
But I'll appeal...
to the Parliament here!

606
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:34,331
I want my uncle to be punished

607
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:37,866
So it'll all be clear!

608
01:16:38,037 --> 01:16:40,062
I want them all here

609
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,804
First Pierre, guilty
of bearing false witness

610
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:47,973
Also my sisters and cousins

611
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:53,517
And my wife who was forced
to sign, and all the villagers

612
01:18:07,026 --> 01:18:09,586
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years

613
01:18:09,762 --> 01:18:12,128
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him

614
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:19,294
When he left, he was thinner,
darker and a bit stooped

615
01:18:20,907 --> 01:18:24,638
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips

616
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:27,637
And a hairy mole on his neck

617
01:18:28,448 --> 01:18:29,710
Show us

618
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:32,916
Here, in the neck

619
01:18:36,823 --> 01:18:38,848
There's no trace of it

620
01:18:43,796 --> 01:18:47,493
And a scar above
his right eyebrow...

621
01:18:48,701 --> 01:18:49,690
...also not there

622
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:53,032
No, sir... that's wrong!

623
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,873
I knew Martin
when he was little, too

624
01:18:56,142 --> 01:19:00,306
I diapered him... and saw
him naked, more often than you!

625
01:19:03,249 --> 01:19:05,080
He had no hairy mole

626
01:19:05,485 --> 01:19:09,148
He had a scar on his forehead...
and still has!

627
01:19:12,358 --> 01:19:14,883
It was closer to his eyebrow

628
01:19:15,061 --> 01:19:19,327
It was here... I ought to know

629
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:22,726
He fell in the barn,
I picked him up

630
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:26,532
Also... open your mouth...

631
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,271
...he broke two teeth

632
01:19:30,443 --> 01:19:33,435
There they are, in back

633
01:19:34,947 --> 01:19:37,939
And a pushed-in thumbnail!

634
01:19:41,688 --> 01:19:45,249
So you maintain that he is
Martin Guerre?

635
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,353
I’m sure, sir...
as sure as night follows day

636
01:19:51,864 --> 01:19:53,195
May I speak?

637
01:19:55,868 --> 01:19:57,563
I’ve seen death

638
01:19:58,771 --> 01:20:03,674
I've heard the roar of cannon
and the screams of the wounded

639
01:20:05,712 --> 01:20:10,411
You wish me ill, Uncle,
but I've lived through worse

640
01:20:11,117 --> 01:20:13,210
But must that be a man's fate...

641
01:20:13,386 --> 01:20:15,354
...for wanting to live
a little...

642
01:20:15,521 --> 01:20:18,354
...before returning
to his family...

643
01:20:19,058 --> 01:20:20,889
...to work the land God gave us?

644
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,453
Don't let him talk any more!

645
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:27,522
He's clever with words

646
01:20:28,067 --> 01:20:29,864
We know who he is now

647
01:20:30,503 --> 01:20:32,903
All he wanted was
my nephew's property

648
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:38,536
I don't want to take it,
I'm defending it!

649
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:43,109
He's not my nephew!

650
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:46,012
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it

651
01:20:46,285 --> 01:20:49,220
Cobbler... step forward

652
01:20:52,191 --> 01:20:54,421
Is it sure they'll let me go?

653
01:20:55,962 --> 01:20:58,931
If I say what I have to say,
can I leave?

654
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:02,957
I guarantee you'll return
to your village

655
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:10,938
Before he left, Martin had
a very large foot

656
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,945
His size was 12 points

657
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:21,114
After he came back...

658
01:21:22,622 --> 01:21:25,591
...his size was only 9 points!

659
01:21:28,561 --> 01:21:29,960
You're quite sure?

660
01:21:30,997 --> 01:21:35,593
Yes, and in my trade
I've seen feet grow bigger...

661
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:39,735
...but I've never known
feet to shrink

662
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:44,341
You're getting old!
Your sight's going...

663
01:21:45,311 --> 01:21:46,209
You forget things

664
01:21:46,746 --> 01:21:49,010
I see better than you,
you old mule!

665
01:21:49,215 --> 01:21:51,615
You see where your interest lies!

666
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:55,753
Jacmette, your fingers remember

667
01:22:09,101 --> 01:22:13,561
Tell them who I am...
Tell the truth

668
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,419
You're Martin Guerre

669
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:37,852
Bertrande, my wife, you know me
better than anyone

670
01:22:38,564 --> 01:22:41,431
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield

671
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:45,670
Swear it on the Holy Gospel

672
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,098
You won't swear it?

673
01:22:50,476 --> 01:22:52,376
Therefore I am your husband?

674
01:22:53,946 --> 01:22:55,971
You are my husband

675
01:23:02,321 --> 01:23:03,811
Come forward, Bertrande

676
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,404
And this cross?

677
01:23:20,339 --> 01:23:22,273
I didn't draw it

678
01:23:24,977 --> 01:23:27,969
Then why didn't you protest?

679
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,807
They threatened me

680
01:23:31,284 --> 01:23:33,582
To throw me out.
- She's lying...

681
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,818
that cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!

682
01:23:37,256 --> 01:23:40,157
They'll do anything...
They tried to kill me!

683
01:23:40,326 --> 01:23:43,818
It's her mark...
I saw her sign it!

684
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:46,058
I didn't sign!

685
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:50,265
I would've signed my name!

686
01:23:51,871 --> 01:23:54,840
How? You can't write!

687
01:23:56,442 --> 01:23:58,637
I’d like a quill and some paper

688
01:24:27,473 --> 01:24:29,202
All this fuss over money!

689
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:32,668
Pierre knows it's his nephew

690
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:39,343
Mass at six in the morning,
for everyone

691
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:00,737
Pierre, how long
are we staying here?

692
01:25:00,906 --> 01:25:04,171
I don't know...
As long as it takes

693
01:25:12,651 --> 01:25:14,209
Who pays for it?

694
01:25:14,387 --> 01:25:15,649
I’ll pay you

695
01:25:16,222 --> 01:25:18,747
Enough to live on...
that's the law

696
01:25:21,027 --> 01:25:22,995
Who is Bertrande de Rols?

697
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:25,857
Why do you want her?

698
01:25:26,165 --> 01:25:27,860
She's to be lodged separately

699
01:25:41,881 --> 01:25:43,314
It's me, Bertrande de Rols

700
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:48,616
Follow me with your children,
by order of the Parliament

701
01:25:58,264 --> 01:26:03,201
Blessed Virgin Mary,
see my distress and my sorrow

702
01:26:06,972 --> 01:26:08,872
Please, help me

703
01:26:10,509 --> 01:26:13,672
Protect me. I feel so lonely...

704
01:26:28,227 --> 01:26:30,127
I brought some chestnut bread

705
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:33,698
It's from our village

706
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,275
It's cold here

707
01:26:46,745 --> 01:26:50,476
My only child...

708
01:26:52,585 --> 01:26:54,610
Do you want to ruin us?

709
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:59,457
But for you, that impostor
would have been executed by now

710
01:27:00,793 --> 01:27:02,818
He seems to have bewitched you

711
01:27:03,162 --> 01:27:05,960
You're under a spell...
You only see him

712
01:27:06,799 --> 01:27:10,530
All he's after is our property

713
01:27:11,337 --> 01:27:13,828
Your husband has bewitched
you.

714
01:27:14,006 --> 01:27:16,474
My own mother attacks us

715
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:22,240
If he isn't my husband,
why did you wait three years?

716
01:27:22,615 --> 01:27:24,583
I wasn't clear before

717
01:27:24,817 --> 01:27:27,945
Now we know he's not Martin

718
01:27:29,088 --> 01:27:31,386
I was always suspicious of him

719
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:37,820
He uses you and you say "Amen!"

720
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:42,793
He's my husband... I know he is

721
01:27:46,105 --> 01:27:50,565
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?

722
01:27:50,843 --> 01:27:54,438
Accused, sit down and
stay seated!

723
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,244
Continue

724
01:27:58,517 --> 01:27:59,245
Didn't he?

725
01:27:59,585 --> 01:28:02,748
Money to pay for killing me!

726
01:28:05,558 --> 01:28:10,518
Call Dominge Pailhas

727
01:28:26,812 --> 01:28:29,280
Don't be afraid

728
01:28:29,848 --> 01:28:34,376
Did Pierre offer you money?

729
01:28:35,054 --> 01:28:37,284
Be honest... yes or no?

730
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:42,124
Yes, he offered me money

731
01:28:43,128 --> 01:28:46,188
I said I wouldn't kill
a relative...

732
01:28:46,365 --> 01:28:47,957
...even for money

733
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,962
I'm sort of related to Martin

734
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:54,036
It's true, that's what he said

735
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:01,673
Thank you. You may go now

736
01:29:02,081 --> 01:29:03,912
Come, Jeanne.

737
01:29:06,986 --> 01:29:08,112
Speak up now.

738
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,279
Didn't Uncle urge my wife
to accuse me?

739
01:29:17,963 --> 01:29:19,328
It's true

740
01:29:20,933 --> 01:29:23,868
Didn't he threaten
to throw her out?

741
01:29:25,271 --> 01:29:27,000
It's true.

742
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:30,237
Didn't he raise his hand to her?

743
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:34,437
It's a lie!

744
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:44,516
Let me talk to her husband

745
01:29:44,723 --> 01:29:46,918
Accused, remain seated!

746
01:29:49,428 --> 01:29:50,918
Come, Augustin

747
01:29:54,233 --> 01:29:56,167
You lived under our roof

748
01:29:56,502 --> 01:29:59,164
After the soldier had
been there...

749
01:30:00,072 --> 01:30:02,597
...you said: Be careful

750
01:30:02,775 --> 01:30:06,438
My uncle was sending people
after me to beat me up

751
01:30:06,645 --> 01:30:07,907
Remember?

752
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,774
To teach me a lesson

753
01:30:12,217 --> 01:30:15,709
You must remember.
We'd beaten the Vals team...

754
01:30:15,888 --> 01:30:17,446
...4- 2. A Sunday in August!

755
01:30:23,696 --> 01:30:25,493
I remember

756
01:30:27,032 --> 01:30:28,624
It's true

757
01:30:30,069 --> 01:30:33,300
So, Uncle, you thought
I'd never find out?

758
01:30:36,075 --> 01:30:38,236
He's the impostor...
the criminal!

759
01:30:38,544 --> 01:30:41,206
He should be sitting here

760
01:30:45,184 --> 01:30:47,914
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...

761
01:30:49,088 --> 01:30:50,248
...who profaned God...

762
01:30:50,422 --> 01:30:52,686
...what do I care?

763
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:56,523
I’m not Arnaud of Tihl!

764
01:31:01,467 --> 01:31:02,764
I’m not this man!

765
01:31:08,874 --> 01:31:10,171
I’m not!

766
01:31:33,065 --> 01:31:36,330
The man's memory is prodigious...

767
01:31:36,735 --> 01:31:39,226
...and he's very clever

768
01:31:41,373 --> 01:31:43,273
What if he were a demon?

769
01:31:46,678 --> 01:31:48,669
It has happened before

770
01:31:49,248 --> 01:31:52,240
Demons like to enter
human beings...

771
01:31:52,418 --> 01:31:54,443
...and poison their minds

772
01:31:56,622 --> 01:31:58,214
What do you say?

773
01:32:02,928 --> 01:32:05,556
Lies have a thousand faces...

774
01:32:06,298 --> 01:32:08,061
...even the Demon's

775
01:32:09,301 --> 01:32:11,269
Truth has only one

776
01:32:12,504 --> 01:32:13,596
And justice exists...

777
01:32:14,173 --> 01:32:16,539
...to discover the truth

778
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:26,976
Jacmette Cayrol has gone to God

779
01:32:40,165 --> 01:32:44,693
Beat the devil out of him!

780
01:32:45,437 --> 01:32:48,031
Stop fighting

781
01:32:50,309 --> 01:32:53,506
Stop it! Jacmette is dead!

782
01:32:56,782 --> 01:32:58,682
Jacmette is dead

783
01:33:21,306 --> 01:33:25,402
He knew everything better than
anyone in the village

784
01:33:27,713 --> 01:33:29,374
When he came back...

785
01:33:30,516 --> 01:33:32,746
...he knew my sons' names

786
01:33:34,853 --> 01:33:37,879
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move

787
01:33:39,024 --> 01:33:41,686
I felt that I was...

788
01:33:42,027 --> 01:33:43,756
...on fire!

789
01:33:52,004 --> 01:33:54,268
I’m sure he uses magic

790
01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:58,342
Even here, with all of us!

791
01:33:59,711 --> 01:34:01,144
Since the world began...

792
01:34:01,313 --> 01:34:04,077
...Satan has had a store of magic

793
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:07,511
How can he know so much?

794
01:34:08,186 --> 01:34:10,848
And have all the answers?

795
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,815
He is the Devil's emissary

796
01:34:14,059 --> 01:34:16,584
Perhaps he is a devil himself!

797
01:34:16,762 --> 01:34:18,593
I’m not a devil...

798
01:34:18,997 --> 01:34:21,056
Be seated

799
01:34:23,101 --> 01:34:26,127
If a devil is in you, speak

800
01:34:26,905 --> 01:34:28,600
Tell us his name

801
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:33,371
A devil?
Then I'd be with my wife!

802
01:34:33,545 --> 01:34:35,775
I wouldn't have been arrested!

803
01:34:35,948 --> 01:34:37,677
I wouldn't be here!

804
01:34:41,753 --> 01:34:43,778
He answered well

805
01:34:44,323 --> 01:34:47,224
There's no proof of any magic

806
01:34:48,193 --> 01:34:50,388
What should we do?

807
01:34:51,129 --> 01:34:52,994
Any suggestions?

808
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:56,964
The most humane solution...

809
01:34:57,703 --> 01:35:00,831
Presume innocence if guilt
is not proven

810
01:35:03,609 --> 01:35:04,667
But first...

811
01:35:05,377 --> 01:35:09,143
...I'd like another chance
to question...

812
01:35:09,314 --> 01:35:11,612
...Martin Guerre's wife

813
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,061
The Court turns to you

814
01:35:35,474 --> 01:35:36,873
Now...

815
01:35:38,076 --> 01:35:39,907
...and for the last time...

816
01:35:41,213 --> 01:35:42,908
...I ask you...

817
01:35:43,882 --> 01:35:46,282
...if that man is your husband

818
01:35:46,451 --> 01:35:49,352
Yes... I'm sure

819
01:35:51,289 --> 01:35:54,884
How can you be
absolutely certain?

820
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:59,428
Speak... We are here to learn all

821
01:36:07,172 --> 01:36:09,572
On his return,
he knew all about me

822
01:36:14,746 --> 01:36:17,510
Did he know intimate details...

823
01:36:17,683 --> 01:36:19,742
...only a husband could know?

824
01:36:29,127 --> 01:36:32,460
What details?

825
01:36:39,538 --> 01:36:42,598
He knew when I wanted him...

826
01:36:43,175 --> 01:36:45,268
...and the words to say

827
01:36:45,711 --> 01:36:46,905
Before...

828
01:36:47,646 --> 01:36:49,011
...during...

829
01:36:49,247 --> 01:36:50,874
...and after

830
01:36:57,289 --> 01:36:58,688
The Court...

831
01:36:59,191 --> 01:37:03,025
...will now retire to deliberate

832
01:37:11,837 --> 01:37:13,737
I think that does it

833
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:20,042
This peasant seems to have
won his case

834
01:37:20,178 --> 01:37:22,009
He's Martin Guerre

835
01:37:22,147 --> 01:37:24,547
It would be inhuman
not to free him

836
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,477
We'll clear his name

837
01:37:27,319 --> 01:37:30,652
Could anyone else
have defended him better?

838
01:38:16,535 --> 01:38:19,800
In the name of the King
and of his justice...

839
01:38:21,106 --> 01:38:23,472
...this Parliament...

840
01:38:24,042 --> 01:38:26,374
...hereby declares...

841
01:38:26,478 --> 01:38:29,311
...that the accused is indeed...

842
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,744
...is indeed Martin...

843
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:45,352
A new witness insists
on being heard

844
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,131
Have him come forward

845
01:39:39,251 --> 01:39:41,776
You claim to be Martin Guerre?

846
01:39:42,487 --> 01:39:44,785
Yes... that's my name

847
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,589
Where were you?

848
01:39:57,102 --> 01:39:58,296
In Picardy... the Army

849
01:40:00,872 --> 01:40:03,170
I lost my leg at St. Quentin

850
01:40:03,808 --> 01:40:07,141
When I arrived in Artigat,
I heard my family was here.

851
01:40:07,879 --> 01:40:09,141
Here I am

852
01:40:10,015 --> 01:40:11,915
Do you know that man?

853
01:40:16,254 --> 01:40:18,415
We soldiered together

854
01:40:19,424 --> 01:40:21,119
His name?

855
01:40:21,226 --> 01:40:23,626
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette

856
01:40:23,795 --> 01:40:25,763
Don't listen! Look at them...

857
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:28,795
Having lost, they try a ruse!

858
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:31,898
A beggar, hired by my uncle!

859
01:40:36,274 --> 01:40:38,367
Do you know that woman?

860
01:40:47,719 --> 01:40:48,913
Bertrande, my wife

861
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,953
It's one last low trick!

862
01:40:55,593 --> 01:40:57,823
You wrong me...
and you insult me?

863
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:00,497
Wrong you?

864
01:41:01,666 --> 01:41:04,100
I’ve never laid eyes on you!

865
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:07,197
Why don't you arrest him?

866
01:41:07,372 --> 01:41:09,533
A hired liar!

867
01:41:11,643 --> 01:41:14,339
Pierre Guerre, come forward.
Where is your wife?

868
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:28,119
Do you know this man?

869
01:41:29,461 --> 01:41:33,522
Yes, I recognize him

870
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:37,301
Martin, my nephew

871
01:41:39,537 --> 01:41:45,271
Let me hug you.
At last you're back

872
01:41:46,978 --> 01:41:48,741
You're quite sure?

873
01:41:49,047 --> 01:41:50,571
Yes, I'm sure

874
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:53,314
He's my brother's son

875
01:41:57,322 --> 01:42:00,416
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God

876
01:42:01,259 --> 01:42:03,250
Arrest him!
- Sit down!

877
01:42:06,898 --> 01:42:09,594
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...

878
01:42:09,768 --> 01:42:11,759
...just in time, like a miracle!

879
01:42:11,903 --> 01:42:12,892
It's God's doing

880
01:42:14,672 --> 01:42:17,800
The hand of God,
manifesting itself

881
01:42:17,976 --> 01:42:19,637
It's divine justice

882
01:42:19,811 --> 01:42:21,244
God has sent him...

883
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:23,447
...to prevent injustice!

884
01:42:40,832 --> 01:42:42,993
Don't forsake me!

885
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:47,435
It's a plot against me

886
01:42:48,673 --> 01:42:50,368
In my own family!

887
01:42:50,909 --> 01:42:57,246
Please listen to me once more...

888
01:42:58,383 --> 01:43:01,614
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat

889
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,182
He's a paid liar

890
01:43:03,354 --> 01:43:07,586
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him

891
01:43:09,527 --> 01:43:12,018
Let me put him to the test!

892
01:43:25,477 --> 01:43:27,536
You claim to be me! Tell me...

893
01:43:28,947 --> 01:43:31,177
...on my wedding night...

894
01:43:31,749 --> 01:43:34,013
...who gave us the nuptial bowl?

895
01:43:42,193 --> 01:43:44,286
She did. Catherine Bore...

896
01:43:44,462 --> 01:43:45,895
She tucked us in

897
01:43:46,531 --> 01:43:48,761
Just after the wedding
I was bewitched

898
01:43:48,933 --> 01:43:50,924
How many masses were said for me?

899
01:43:54,772 --> 01:43:57,639
It's so long ago... and I'm tired

900
01:44:03,181 --> 01:44:04,876
Answer!

901
01:44:05,783 --> 01:44:09,810
Six...
- He's wrong! He doesn't know!

902
01:44:10,121 --> 01:44:11,816
Not six... four!

903
01:44:13,024 --> 01:44:16,152
Dominique Caylar, answer.
Tell the truth

904
01:44:17,028 --> 01:44:20,259
I said four masses, it's true

905
01:44:26,738 --> 01:44:29,798
You should have been
better informed

906
01:44:30,909 --> 01:44:33,537
Where was the spell broken?

907
01:44:34,012 --> 01:44:35,445
At the priest's

908
01:44:36,648 --> 01:44:38,673
Was it hot or cold?

909
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:40,613
Cold... I was naked

910
01:44:40,919 --> 01:44:45,754
We warmed up quickly!

911
01:44:51,062 --> 01:44:55,931
Who bought the sacks of grain
I stole?

912
01:44:57,835 --> 01:44:59,735
Smallpox Andre

913
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:02,202
You learned that lesson well

914
01:45:06,077 --> 01:45:10,104
When I went away,
what did I leave...

915
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:12,511
...in the linen-chest upstairs?

916
01:45:14,385 --> 01:45:16,250
What did I leave?

917
01:45:16,421 --> 01:45:18,719
I left it! What was it?

918
01:45:23,995 --> 01:45:26,520
White breeches!

919
01:45:26,731 --> 01:45:30,462
Sewn by Bertrande...
and you didn't know!

920
01:45:30,635 --> 01:45:32,967
But I told you.
- No, I told you!

921
01:45:33,137 --> 01:45:35,662
Don't twist it around!
Arrest him!

922
01:45:36,374 --> 01:45:38,672
I’ve proven I'm Martin Guerre

923
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:43,579
You say you told him?

924
01:45:43,748 --> 01:45:46,080
And he's trying to use it!

925
01:45:46,251 --> 01:45:48,048
But before you said...

926
01:45:48,786 --> 01:45:51,152
...you didn't know him

927
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,356
Accused, sit down

928
01:46:06,571 --> 01:46:08,732
The sisters, come here

929
01:46:19,017 --> 01:46:21,815
Which one is your brother?

930
01:46:23,554 --> 01:46:25,852
Make up your minds

931
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,791
This is my brother

932
01:46:41,739 --> 01:46:44,435
No, you're making a mistake!

933
01:46:44,609 --> 01:46:48,909
And you, Guillemette?
What do you say?

934
01:46:50,948 --> 01:46:53,109
I can't remember

935
01:46:53,284 --> 01:46:54,979
I was too little

936
01:46:56,054 --> 01:46:58,716
Maybe it's him

937
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:00,790
He's my father!

938
01:47:01,526 --> 01:47:03,892
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!

939
01:47:04,228 --> 01:47:07,356
Silence!

940
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:20,343
What do you say?

941
01:47:21,312 --> 01:47:23,109
Of no importance...

942
01:47:23,381 --> 01:47:25,110
I'm not family

943
01:47:25,283 --> 01:47:28,616
Catherine... tell them

944
01:48:08,326 --> 01:48:09,657
Forgive me, Martin

945
01:48:11,763 --> 01:48:14,527
Don't cry... Women cry easily

946
01:48:15,566 --> 01:48:18,831
You should have known
your own husband

947
01:48:20,605 --> 01:48:23,233
Our house is dishonored

948
01:48:23,641 --> 01:48:25,472
It's all your fault

949
01:48:29,313 --> 01:48:32,077
You're to blame, Martin

950
01:48:36,621 --> 01:48:38,953
You betrayed my friendship

951
01:48:40,725 --> 01:48:42,556
You deserve no pity

952
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:52,735
What harm in caring for
a woman her husband deserted?

953
01:48:57,642 --> 01:49:02,272
We await your confession,
Arnaud of Tihl

954
01:49:10,421 --> 01:49:11,911
It's true

955
01:49:14,826 --> 01:49:16,885
We soldiered together

956
01:49:20,231 --> 01:49:22,529
He talked about his wife...

957
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,061
...his son, his house

958
01:49:26,437 --> 01:49:29,668
One day on the road,
two men took me for him

959
01:49:29,841 --> 01:49:31,433
They called me Martin

960
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:34,105
It gave me an idea

961
01:49:34,779 --> 01:49:36,542
I thought...

962
01:49:39,917 --> 01:49:42,613
...why not take his place?

963
01:49:48,459 --> 01:49:51,451
So I learned all I could

964
01:49:51,629 --> 01:49:54,325
Martin said he wasn't going back

965
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:58,061
I went to Artigat

966
01:49:58,236 --> 01:50:00,101
I was taken for him

967
01:50:04,442 --> 01:50:06,376
I almost told them...

968
01:50:06,544 --> 01:50:09,445
"I fooled you!
Martin's up north!"

969
01:50:09,881 --> 01:50:11,872
I almost said it

970
01:50:16,621 --> 01:50:18,418
Then I saw you

971
01:50:22,059 --> 01:50:24,493
I took you in my arms

972
01:50:27,298 --> 01:50:29,596
Next day, it was too late

973
01:50:32,603 --> 01:50:35,902
After that, I learned
whatever I didn't know...

974
01:50:36,207 --> 01:50:39,574
...from my uncle, sisters, wife

975
01:50:40,778 --> 01:50:43,212
And I remember it

976
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:57,116
There's no magic in it...

977
01:50:58,863 --> 01:51:01,058
...I swear it

978
01:51:07,772 --> 01:51:12,072
You don't deserve her

979
01:51:13,044 --> 01:51:15,604
I know her better than you do

980
01:51:24,589 --> 01:51:30,653
I ask you all to forgive me

981
01:51:34,732 --> 01:51:36,097
And you...

982
01:51:37,668 --> 01:51:39,135
...who were my wife

983
01:51:58,222 --> 01:52:01,521
Your men can stay in the barn

984
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,487
Are you thirsty?

985
01:52:04,762 --> 01:52:06,889
Where's Bertrande?

986
01:52:07,098 --> 01:52:08,827
At home

987
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,633
Pierre Guerre, you brought
discord to this village

988
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:14,961
Now keep the peace

989
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:30,978
Leave us, please

990
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:03,984
I'm thirsty

991
01:53:16,067 --> 01:53:22,006
You have dared much
and feared God very little

992
01:53:25,876 --> 01:53:28,902
We hesitated before
declaring you innocent

993
01:53:31,215 --> 01:53:36,278
It was unwise to take
that stranger into your bed

994
01:53:38,856 --> 01:53:40,517
Women are often the victims...

995
01:53:40,691 --> 01:53:43,091
...of men's wickedness

996
01:53:49,667 --> 01:53:52,261
That's why we acquitted you...

997
01:53:53,771 --> 01:53:55,830
...and legitimized...

998
01:53:56,407 --> 01:53:57,806
...your daughter's birth

999
01:53:58,642 --> 01:54:01,372
We hope that now...

1000
01:54:01,946 --> 01:54:04,437
...you will be a good wife

1001
01:54:08,986 --> 01:54:11,352
But tell me...

1002
01:54:12,223 --> 01:54:14,453
...so I'll understand

1003
01:54:19,797 --> 01:54:22,265
Before Arnaud appeared...

1004
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,832
...you needed a man?

1005
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:31,231
And this one pleased you?

1006
01:54:34,411 --> 01:54:38,006
Did he satisfy your needs?

1007
01:54:42,586 --> 01:54:44,884
You loved each other?

1008
01:54:49,326 --> 01:54:52,625
You knew from the start?

1009
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:55,093
You can tell me

1010
01:54:55,266 --> 01:54:57,325
It will go no farther

1011
01:55:02,773 --> 01:55:04,240
Arnaud and I...

1012
01:55:07,478 --> 01:55:09,446
...were good together

1013
01:55:12,683 --> 01:55:14,878
Martin had neglected me

1014
01:55:16,687 --> 01:55:18,712
Arnaud respected me...

1015
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:21,551
...like a true husband

1016
01:55:23,694 --> 01:55:25,628
I trusted him

1017
01:55:29,867 --> 01:55:33,166
We thought of asking to be judged

1018
01:55:34,805 --> 01:55:36,830
We could have won

1019
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:46,277
If Martin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife

1020
01:55:47,785 --> 01:55:50,379
No one could've denied it

1021
01:55:51,455 --> 01:55:53,548
At the last minute...

1022
01:55:53,724 --> 01:55:55,453
...why did you change?

1023
01:55:57,561 --> 01:55:59,756
Why choose Martin?

1024
01:56:06,804 --> 01:56:08,931
In Arnaud's eyes...

1025
01:56:12,476 --> 01:56:14,706
...I saw it was hopeless

1026
01:56:19,149 --> 01:56:21,379
I saw what he wanted

1027
01:56:30,794 --> 01:56:33,160
He wanted me to live...

1028
01:56:34,031 --> 01:56:36,556
for me and my children

1029
01:56:38,769 --> 01:56:40,964
So I did it

1030
01:57:03,994 --> 01:57:06,656
God forgive me,
I defiled marriage!

1031
01:57:06,964 --> 01:57:12,129
The King, the law,
all those I offended...

1032
01:57:14,738 --> 01:57:16,296
...forgive me!

1033
01:57:19,376 --> 01:57:20,968
Get up, Arnaud

1034
01:57:40,297 --> 01:57:42,959
Open the door

1035
01:58:39,490 --> 01:58:43,449
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!

1036
01:58:44,161 --> 01:58:47,255
The King, the law...

1037
01:58:48,465 --> 01:58:51,025
...all those I offended!

1038
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,980
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!

1039
01:59:13,957 --> 01:59:16,482
The King, the law...

1040
01:59:17,961 --> 01:59:20,293
...all those I offended!

1041
02:00:04,041 --> 02:00:07,772
Commend your soul to God

1042
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:29,493
The story of false
Martin Guerre...

1043
02:00:29,766 --> 02:00:31,961
...ended that morning

1044
02:00:33,237 --> 02:00:38,504
The Counselor, Jean de Coras
impressed by this...

1045
02:00:38,675 --> 02:00:41,269
...daring imposture,
made a record of it

1046
02:00:42,479 --> 02:00:44,379
12 years later came...

1047
02:00:44,781 --> 02:00:47,443
...the St. Bartholomew Massacre

1048
02:00:47,751 --> 02:00:50,447
For his Protestant beliefs...

1049
02:00:50,621 --> 02:00:54,648
...Jean de Coras was hung before
the Toulouse Parliament...

1050
02:00:55,058 --> 02:00:57,822
...with a hundred of his friends

1051
02:00:59,463 --> 02:01:02,227
But we live only by the spirit
