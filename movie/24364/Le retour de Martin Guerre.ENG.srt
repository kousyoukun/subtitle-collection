00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:55,807
THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE

2
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,723
On this St Michael's Sunday
in the church of Artigat,

3
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,143
we receive Bertrande de Rols,

4
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:24,896
daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols

5
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,482
and of Raimonde, his wife.

6
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,984
And we receive Martin Guerre,

7
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,487
son of Mathurin Guerre

8
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:35,448
and of Brigitte, his wife.

9
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,925
I, Martin,
give my body to thee, Bertrande.

10
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:58,763
I accept it
and give my body to thee, Martin.

11
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,098
I accept it.

12
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,355
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony.

13
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:14,779
You will not regret
having followed this story

14
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,825
for it is neither a tale of adventure

15
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,785
nor an imaginary fable.

16
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,289
It is a true story.

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,963
It began one August Sunday, in 1542,

18
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,968
in the village of Artigat,
county of Foix,

19
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,012
in the reign of Francis I.

20
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:47,061
Bertrande, at her parents' decision,

21
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,314
brings a dowry of 30 acres of wheat

22
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,026
and 40 of millet,
at the place called Pomarede.

23
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:59,073
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods,

24
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,370
inherited from her father Laurent,
deceased.

25
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,168
Three red dresses,
a bed and two feather pillows,

26
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,837
one linen-chest with lock and key.

27
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,006
That's all.

28
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,175
Catherine.

29
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,343
Something to drink.

30
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,849
If you still agree, sign here.

31
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,030
You'll have to blow hard, my boy!

32
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:57,924
It's a good match, well arranged.

33
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,803
May the Lord bless this bed
with health...

34
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,478
and keep the Demon from this house.

35
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,939
Kiss her, Father.

36
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:22,490
Martin, tender buds
need to be sprinkled at night.

37
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,409
You two, kiss your brother.

38
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,750
Make us some pretty grandchildren!

39
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,345
The rest, you can do without me.

40
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,190
Whenever you want,
come eat and dance.

41
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,133
Make room!

42
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:05,593
Carry on, sir.

43
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,386
That's her.

44
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,181
That is Bertrande de Rols.

45
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:23,361
You say at first your husband couldn't
consummate your marriage. Why not?

46
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:28,240
Because of the spell
that had been cast on him.

47
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:33,329
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?

48
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,375
Yes... but I didn't.

49
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,796
I was married...

50
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,382
I felt bound to him.

51
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,217
People knew?

52
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,595
Of course.
We had no children.

53
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:51,806
They made fun of him?

54
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,892
Yes... the whole village.

55
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,232
Tell me what happened
that Candlemas Day.

56
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:51,866
A serenade for Bertrande
and her husband!

57
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,125
If you're tired of sleeping at night
change husbands!

58
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,838
Change husbands
if you want to have children!

59
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,160
Don't be afraid.

60
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:41,082
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament.

61
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,710
I am now in charge of this matter.

62
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,510
You must tell me everything.

63
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,346
Even if the priest said not to.

64
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,100
It's caused by evil thoughts.

65
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,019
They put a spell on you.

66
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:05,022
I'll take it away.

67
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,204
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you.

68
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,915
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you.

69
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,376
Blessed Flesh, I make you grow again.

70
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,094
Accursed Demon,
leave this servant of the Lord!

71
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,514
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin

72
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,267
whose flesh is suffering.

73
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:44,436
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin

74
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,772
whose flesh is suffering.

75
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:50,317
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Bertrande

76
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,570
whose flesh is suffering.

77
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,286
And do your best to help things along.

78
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,413
And that worked?

79
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,749
That very day, yes.

80
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,421
We had a son.

81
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,590
His name is Sanxi.

82
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,302
So all was well.

83
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,598
For me, yes, but Martin...

84
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,686
Martin kept to himself.

85
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,440
He didn't even look at our son.

86
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,611
He didn't like farming.

87
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,447
He and his father argued.

88
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,123
You want us to die of thirst?

89
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,842
Where were you?

90
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,470
You can't do anything right!

91
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,140
I was with some soldiers,
at the stream.

92
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,327
Two sacks of grain are gone.
You seen them?

93
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,412
You stole them.

94
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,707
You loaded the grain.
You stole them!

95
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,544
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!

96
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,839
I'll make you hate
the taste of bread!

97
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,384
I didn't take them!

98
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,886
While I'm alive, I'm the master here!

99
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,568
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?

100
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,198
Wear them Sunday.

101
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,204
You cut them too big.

102
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,873
You wasted your time.

103
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,709
You always scold me.

104
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,927
It's not my fault.

105
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:24,763
Be nice sometimes.

106
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm sorry.

107
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,574
That was the night he left.

108
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,660
Why steal the grain?

109
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,081
Did he know he was leaving?

110
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,625
And needed money?

111
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,461
Maybe. I don't know.

112
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,005
He didn't talk much to me.

113
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,096
What did you think?

114
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,683
That he'd be back soon.

115
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,437
Everyone thought so.

116
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,857
That his father had scared him.

117
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,444
He waited for Martin
every day for months.

118
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,782
Finally he died... killed by sorrow.

119
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,826
Martin's mother died a year later.

120
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,174
Your mother got married again?

121
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:43,884
Yes.

122
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:48,180
To Pierre Guerre, my husband's uncle.

123
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,016
To keep the farms together?

124
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,310
No doubt.

125
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,647
Our lands are now held in common.

126
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,498
The wolves are out tonight.

127
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,543
Make sure the animals are locked up.

128
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,504
Yes, mother.
I do it every night.

129
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,318
You little rat!

130
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,281
Filthy rat!

131
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,742
Did Martin stay away long?

132
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,411
Eight winters, or nine.

133
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,789
You never heard from him?

134
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,502
No... Nothing.

135
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,088
But I'm sure
you had no lack of admirers.

136
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,758
No, but I kept my virtue.

137
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,928
Speak up, we can't hear you.

138
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,305
I kept my virtue.

139
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,266
Ask anyone. I remained chaste.

140
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,436
You never forgot Martin?

141
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,861
I prayed to St Catherine
to send him back.

142
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,824
So many seasons passed...

143
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,163
Then she heard me.

144
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:54,825
Hello, there.

145
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,705
Who are you?

146
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,917
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?

147
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,669
Who are you?

148
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,215
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely.

149
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,429
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

150
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,691
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?

151
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,864
- Is it you, Martin?
- You bet it is!

152
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,870
You're back!

153
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,752
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son.

154
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,046
No, Jacques is my brother.

155
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,131
Right...

156
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,717
You're "Smallpox André".

157
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,900
Remember the bear hunt,
when Nicolas "castrated" me?

158
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,320
Made me miserable, didn't you?

159
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,075
Martin Guerre is back!

160
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,077
You're bigger, Martin.

161
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,412
War does that.

162
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,461
Martin Guerre is back!

163
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,130
- What are you saying?
- You've seen him?

164
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,091
Yes! He's down the road.

165
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,981
Guillemette, your brother!

166
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,609
- Are you sure?
- I saw him!

167
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,403
The son of Mathurin?

168
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,447
Bertrande, your husband's back!

169
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,993
Come, it's your husband.

170
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,650
You still here?

171
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,986
Hello, Barthélemy.

172
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,241
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!

173
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,015
Hello, Jeanne, sister.

174
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,017
Martin! At last!

175
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,394
You've changed!

176
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,067
Where's your husband?

177
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,036
Are you Guillemette?

178
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,877
You were so small when I left!

179
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,715
Come kiss your brother!

180
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,641
Sanxi?

181
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,440
You're so big.

182
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,443
Don't be afraid.

183
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,113
Come nearer.

184
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,158
I'm your father.

185
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,305
Hello, uncle.

186
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,142
You were gone a long time.

187
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,772
That's true.

188
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,276
Forgive me for what I did.

189
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,156
Your father and mother are dead.

190
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,661
I heard, and I prayed for them.

191
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,708
I also heard you married Raimonde...

192
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,128
my wife's mother.

193
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,798
It's good news.

194
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,136
My daughter has suffered.

195
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,348
Have you changed for the better?

196
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,276
You're here...

197
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,820
It's all true!

198
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,324
Is it really you?

199
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,168
Is it you, Catherine?

200
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,213
You haven't changed.

201
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,181
I wondered if you'd ever come back.

202
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,852
And here you are, safe and sound.

203
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,333
- Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house.

204
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,044
She's waiting for you.

205
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,051
To the wash-house!

206
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,915
It's me.

207
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,816
It's me. Martin.

208
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,834
Hello, Martin.

209
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:01,644
My God, my wife is beautiful.

210
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,345
It is a gift of God
that you have returned.

211
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,900
He was in the Army in Picardy.

212
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,244
Don't you recognize me?

213
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,621
Who are you?

214
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,040
It's me. Nicolas.

215
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,138
It's confusing, seeing you all.

216
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:54,632
Here's cloth from Flanders.

217
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,510
The nicest for Bertrande, with lace.

218
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,437
Catherine, take the last one.

219
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,497
You've learned to read?

220
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,882
And to write, too.

221
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,843
To write?

222
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,691
What did you do all this time?

223
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,658
I fought in the war.

224
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,536
I even went to Spain.

225
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,545
Then I wanted to see you.

226
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,597
All of you.

227
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,474
What's Spain like?

228
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,518
It's dry.

229
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,771
And Paris? Did you see Paris?

230
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,525
It's big.

231
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,612
There are people everywhere.

232
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,532
I even got lost there.

233
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,712
There are thieves at night.

234
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,465
You're so strong now, Martin!

235
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,509
This calls for a celebration!

236
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,097
When you left here, Martin...

237
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,725
you didn't have a beard yet.

238
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,769
And you didn't drink as much!

239
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,399
Now I drink like a monk!

240
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,986
After war...

241
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,113
Peace!

242
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:23,948
To you, my wife.

243
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,628
A little rough, but not bad.

244
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,423
Just enough to kill the worms!

245
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,109
I'll prepare your bed.

246
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,790
It's good to be on your own land.

247
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,668
What are you looking for?

248
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,796
The candles.

249
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,464
In there.

250
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:23,841
You moved them?

251
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,470
No, they've always been there.

252
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:31,808
Then I forgot.

253
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,546
She cried a lot because of you.

254
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,425
Remember, Bertrande?

255
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,719
Go get my white breeches,

256
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,514
the one lined with silk,

257
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,685
from the linen-chest.

258
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,773
If they're still there.

259
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:28,948
I'll go.

260
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,121
You've found your smile.

261
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:52,388
"The bird's back in the nest.
Tonight they will not rest."

262
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:16,954
They're still here.

263
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,751
Waiting for you, like me.

264
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,351
I'll wear them tomorrow.

265
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,642
How often I've wanted you...

266
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,073
I'm here only because of you.

267
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,871
So everyone recognized him?

268
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:42,707
Yes, everyone.

269
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,917
His sisters...

270
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:46,877
His uncle...

271
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,589
Catherine, the servant?

272
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,591
His friends...
The whole village.

273
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,219
You, too?

274
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,097
Me, too.

275
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,100
Without hesitation?

276
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,609
Then what?

277
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:13,195
He took up his work,
his place at home.

278
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,408
We had two children.

279
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,035
The first died.

280
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,287
The second is alive, a girl.

281
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:22,872
18 months old.

282
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,460
And everything went well?

283
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,045
Very well.

284
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,297
Better than before?

285
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,465
Yes.

286
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,885
And he worked hard.

287
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,263
Our harvests have never been better.

288
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,266
And between you two?

289
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:44,894
It's been good.

290
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:51,734
When did the doubts first begin?

291
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,905
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn.

292
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:14,924
You!

293
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,469
A game for 15 points?

294
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,764
I don't gamble.

295
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:28,354
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy relic?

296
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:31,107
Go to the devil, we have a priest!

297
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,278
I'm going back.

298
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:42,952
I'll play.

299
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,955
Dominique, play with me.

300
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,624
No, I think not. Like Martin.

301
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,503
Come on, Father. Only 15 points.

302
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:00,469
Who is he?

303
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,388
It's Martin.

304
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,477
Martin Guerre,
who went away and came back.

305
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,271
Like the prodigal son.

306
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,065
He's not Martin Guerre.

307
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,651
I knew Martin Guerre.

308
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,656
At the battle of Saint-Quentin.

309
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,410
In fact, he lost a leg there.

310
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,203
Of course, it's Martin.

311
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:30,040
I ought to know,
I'm the one who married him.

312
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,834
But it's not.

313
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,045
He's...

314
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,049
What's his name again?

315
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:45,014
I knew him on the Army, too.

316
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,183
It's Martin!

317
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,852
We're even related.

318
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,189
I tell you he's not Martin.

319
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,066
He's Pansette!

320
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:57,860
That's it.

321
00:37:58,569 --> 00:37:59,862
Pansette.

322
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,201
He's from the village of Tihl.

323
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,245
I knew him in Picardie, too.

324
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,918
What's he doing here?

325
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,046
I saw two of those people in Arras.

326
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,548
From a land called Brazil.

327
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,057
Their bodies were all painted.

328
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,478
They had feathers on their heads.

329
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,647
It's true, Sanxi.

330
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,655
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us.

331
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,455
They were in chains,
and made to dance.

332
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,091
In their own country, they go naked.

333
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,636
Even the women?

334
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,180
Sounds like a nice country.

335
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,266
Then you should go there.

336
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,985
They eat their prisoners' hearts.

337
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,115
Are they human?

338
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,909
Do they have a soul?

339
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,703
The monks say they do.

340
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,962
In some tribes,
they share their land and their women.

341
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,301
In others, the women go to war
and make all the decisions.

342
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:53,309
The day women rule here,

343
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,687
it'll be the end of the world.

344
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,236
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind.

345
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,355
No! Let's go home, I'm afraid.

346
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,067
Why?

347
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,366
See! A circle of smoke.

348
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,035
Spirits will be out.

349
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,038
We mustn't look at them.

350
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,557
Pansette! What are you doing?

351
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,102
Leaving us already?

352
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,315
Trying to find your way?

353
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:27,778
When are you going?

354
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:30,906
Did you come to the wrong village?

355
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,462
It's you!
Doesn't surprise me, idiot!

356
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:52,136
He's strong!

357
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,805
Not like Martin. Right, Bertrande?

358
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:58,600
Pansette, you look true
but you play false.

359
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,603
Beware!

360
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,449
Where was this soldier from?

361
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,617
A garrison in Picardy.

362
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,461
Don't believe tales told by strangers.

363
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:28,130
And by drunks.

364
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,299
Or by rogues.

365
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:33,343
He's right.

366
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,475
"Lies come easy from afar."

367
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,315
We know Martin well.

368
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,217
If anyone knows Martin...

369
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,386
it's us.

370
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,804
We must do our accounts one day.

371
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,432
How much my land earned
in my absence.

372
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,394
What do you mean?

373
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:11,400
You worked my land and I'm grateful,
but it made a profit.

374
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:13,569
Now I need the money.

375
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,239
I figure it's about 6000 livres.

376
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:21,243
You dare ask me for an accounting?

377
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:27,457
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?

378
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,460
I, who protected your wife?

379
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:35,424
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?

380
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,761
It was your duty!
I went to war, I have a right to it!

381
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:41,597
You have no right. You left!

382
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,975
Yes, I have!
I have the law on my side.

383
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:48,645
I'll seek justice, if I must.

384
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,316
You'll be condemned.

385
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,443
You threaten your uncle?

386
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,532
I need that money.

387
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:08,123
I'll sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pujol's.

388
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,126
To plant barley.

389
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:16,465
You want to sell your father's field?

390
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:19,509
It's too steep for planting.

391
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,473
You're starting
to squander our property!

392
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,809
But I expected it.

393
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,479
I'm not surprised.

394
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,649
I warn you...

395
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,152
Martin or not Martin...

396
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,738
you won't get away with it!

397
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,490
What did you say?

398
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,326
Repeat that!

399
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:46,912
What did you say?

400
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,499
Let go of me!

401
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:56,546
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too.

402
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,590
The whole village did.

403
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,509
You all welcomed him.

404
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,763
Look at Bertrande.

405
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,183
She's not complaining.

406
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,102
She's never looked better.

407
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:12,688
When he came back,

408
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:15,190
he'd been gone a long time.

409
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,197
What if we were all mistaken?

410
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,369
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?

411
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,415
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief.

412
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,210
You're right to stand up to him.

413
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:39,965
You be careful, too.

414
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:46,096
After me, it'll be your turn.

415
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:48,932
He'll wipe your ass.

416
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,311
And take your shirt!

417
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:58,233
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again.

418
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,237
Leaving you your eyes to cry with.

419
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,407
Then you'll see
what kind of man he is!

420
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:21,757
The work isn't finished!

421
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,803
I'm ashamed of you, uncle.

422
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,293
My father wants you.

423
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:01,797
I'm coming.

424
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,521
What do you want?

425
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,815
I've thought it over.

426
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:25,404
You're right.
I have the money.

427
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:28,824
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you.

428
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,701
I don't want any trouble.

429
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,837
Know where your father hid money?

430
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,759
No, he never told me.

431
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:52,681
In the hay-loft above the stable.

432
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:05,527
I'll wait for you there
at cock's crow.

433
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,946
I'll give you your due.

434
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,791
But let's keep it to ourselves.

435
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:50,572
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales.

436
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,909
They're all jealous.

437
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:58,330
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar.

438
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:00,749
All they talk about is us.

439
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,628
Calm down, my uncle has understood.

440
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,505
He'll shut them up.

441
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:08,924
Give me your hand.

442
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,938
Let me guide you.

443
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,620
Is that her name?

444
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,958
Yes, that's my name.

445
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:05,063
It's in the grain chest.

446
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:20,829
You wanted it, right?

447
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:24,249
You wanted what we owe you?

448
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,877
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...

449
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,005
in hard cash!

450
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,845
You won't ask for it again!

451
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:42,225
At your service, Pansette!

452
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,895
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!

453
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,625
You were ready to die for him?

454
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:09,544
Yes, to protect him.

455
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,049
Explain something to me.

456
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:19,387
You defended your husband,
risking your own life.

457
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,266
But when his uncle
attacked him legally,

458
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,101
you didn't say anything.

459
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:28,146
You should've protested,

460
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,650
talked to the judge,

461
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,320
told everyone:
"I know he's my husband."

462
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,907
But you said nothing.

463
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,411
Why?

464
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,253
Did you have doubts, too?

465
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:56,675
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?

466
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,764
At one moment, I was troubled.

467
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,101
I wavered.

468
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:08,478
I thought...

469
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,938
Speak up.

470
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:14,609
I thought:
"Maybe he's fooling me, too."

471
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:19,489
Charming me, as he did others.

472
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,493
Then my daughter is a bastard.

473
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:29,290
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell.

474
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:33,962
Yes... I had doubts.

475
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:36,965
And still have?

476
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:40,969
No, not any more.

477
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:42,971
Then he is your husband?

478
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:46,015
Yes or no?

479
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,729
I say yes.

480
00:53:57,527 --> 00:53:59,028
And what does he say?

481
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,030
The same thing, obviously.

482
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:03,199
He says they're man and wife.

483
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:07,412
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament.

484
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,842
Go join your family.

485
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:26,055
You are Martin Guerre?

486
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:29,100
Yes, I am.

487
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:31,436
You're quite sure?

488
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,606
I don't know of any other.

489
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,906
Walk on.

490
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,585
You're going to pay.

491
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:58,588
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!

492
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,174
The law will punish you,
you cheater!

493
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:04,385
You tricked us to steal our property!

494
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:05,804
Silence!

495
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,891
The family apart...

496
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,643
Over here.

497
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:28,159
Now listen to me, all of you.

498
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,831
Those who honestly think...

499
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:37,126
this man is not Martin Guerre,
to my left.

500
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,477
Shame on you, Nicolas!

501
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:03,152
Those who honestly think...

502
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:07,615
he truly is Martin Guerre,

503
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,785
to my right.

504
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:25,341
And you?

505
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:32,140
I am their priest.

506
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:37,145
But surely you have an opinion.

507
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:13,431
The others have no opinion?

508
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:24,233
In settlement of this dispute,

509
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:28,863
I, Jean de Coras,
Councillor of the Toulouse Parliament,

510
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:32,116
declare that there is no reason

511
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,036
to believe
this man is not Martin Guerre.

512
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,082
The charge is dismissed
for lack of proof.

513
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:43,419
This man shall be released.

514
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:46,089
Pierre Guerre is condemned

515
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:50,093
to pay 500 livres
to the king and to his nephew

516
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:52,220
for calumny.

517
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:58,977
Free him.

518
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,280
You are a knave!

519
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:14,283
God knows it
and will punish you!

520
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:18,287
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other.

521
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,461
That was an excellent judgement.

522
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:04,769
What happened to my brother?

523
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:08,022
You should be in bed.

524
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,376
On your feet.
This time we've got you.

525
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:11,961
Get dressed.

526
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:14,255
- What?
- Get dressed.

527
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,425
- You're under arrest.
- I was released yesterday!

528
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,595
Things changed during the night.

529
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:22,763
Look.

530
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,268
This time, your wife signed, too.

531
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,314
- My wife?
- Here.

532
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:41,199
Get dressed!
You're going to Toulouse.

533
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:44,994
When did she sign?

534
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:49,040
Last night,
before going to bed.

535
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,544
Is it true?

536
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,047
They made you sign?

537
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,345
Hurry up!

538
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,307
This time, you're done for.

539
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:43,511
The accusation is the same,

540
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:47,723
but it will be more difficult
to answer.

541
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:51,686
- Your wife signed.
- It's a forgery!

542
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:55,898
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?

543
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,859
Her uncle and cousins scare her.

544
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:02,363
They might cut her throat.

545
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,366
They've threatened her?

546
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,036
Often.

547
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,124
Especially lately.

548
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:19,380
She now says you betrayed her.

549
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:22,925
That you're not her husband.
That's serious.

550
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:25,136
I know her.

551
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:27,221
They forced her to sign.

552
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:30,725
Assure her safety,

553
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:34,395
and ask me what you want.
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre.

554
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:39,608
We've heard many witnesses,

555
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,739
and we shall hear more.

556
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:51,412
Shall a councillor defend you?

557
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,459
I don't need help to prove who I am.

558
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,003
Who married you?

559
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:04,258
Father Dominique Caylar.
He's still there.

560
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,927
He doesn't like me
because I swear a lot.

561
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:12,141
We married on St Michael's day,
18 years ago.

562
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:13,934
Who was the notary?

563
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:20,274
Jehan Pegala, from Le Fossat.

564
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,281
He was late, my father was upset.

565
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:32,995
Bertrande's dowry
was the Roussas woods,

566
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:37,792
her lands at Pomarede, two oxen,

567
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,795
a bed with feather pillows,

568
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:44,507
and three dresses.

569
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:46,300
And sacks of grain.

570
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,636
Have you forgotten?

571
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:54,683
No.

572
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,521
No sack of grain.

573
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:10,658
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband.

574
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:13,828
That wasn't so before.

575
01:05:16,497 --> 01:05:19,708
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left.

576
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:21,502
And she's changed.

577
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,506
So have I.

578
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:31,846
You're not stupid.

579
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,692
You know you risk death?

580
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,862
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!

581
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:51,115
I was his nephew
until I wanted my money.

582
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:54,910
Everyone knew me:
my sisters, my wife's mother...

583
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:56,745
Even my wife.

584
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,123
Others also say you're not Martin.

585
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,875
My uncle's rich!

586
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:03,752
They're afraid of him.

587
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,714
He acts out of self-interest.

588
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:10,301
He'd rob me of my name
and my property.

589
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,261
It's outrageous!

590
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,556
Follow me.

591
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,764
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?

592
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:06,357
You asked to see this man.

593
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:14,615
Do you know him?

594
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:24,542
Yes... It's him.

595
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:27,670
Who is he?

596
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:30,798
What's his name?

597
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:34,802
It's Arnaud.

598
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:43,811
It's Arnaud.

599
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,815
They call him Pansette.

600
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:51,318
Where is he from?

601
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,030
Our village.

602
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:58,826
- He's from Tihl.
- You're sure?

603
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:01,829
He left a long time ago,

604
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,914
but that's him.

605
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:08,502
- Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?
- No.

606
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,672
Arnaud, from Tihl.

607
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,048
Called Pansette!

608
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:14,508
Look at them.

609
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:17,094
Look at them!

610
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,930
They're sent by my uncle!

611
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:23,684
Bought and paid for!

612
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,436
Look at them.

613
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:27,521
Shame written on their faces!

614
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:30,899
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified.

615
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,194
So what?

616
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:36,864
My uncle has influence.

617
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,283
Why would I pretend?

618
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:42,369
To have a house and a wife.

619
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,915
But it's my house, and my wife!

620
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:49,376
I'm wronged, and I'm accused!

621
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:56,884
Never was a husband so maligned!

622
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:58,886
But I'll appeal...

623
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:01,472
To the Parliament, here.

624
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:03,891
I want my uncle to be punished!

625
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:07,519
So it'll all be clear!

626
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:09,772
I want them all here.

627
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:14,234
First Pierre,
guilty of bearing false witness.

628
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:17,946
Also my sisters and cousins.

629
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:23,327
And my wife who was forced to sign,
and all the villagers!

630
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,413
All those who've known me
since I was born!

631
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,361
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years!

632
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,156
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him.

633
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:45,993
When he left, he was thinner,

634
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:49,163
darker and a bit stooped.

635
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:54,376
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips.

636
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,005
And a hairy mole on his neck...

637
01:10:58,672 --> 01:10:59,882
Show us.

638
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:02,509
Here, on his neck.

639
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,682
There's no trace of it.

640
01:11:13,604 --> 01:11:17,232
And a scar above his right eyebrow.

641
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:19,443
Also not there.

642
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,029
No, sir. That's wrong.

643
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,491
I knew Martin when he was little, too.

644
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:27,910
I diapered him,

645
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:30,204
and saw him naked
more often than you!

646
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:34,082
He had no hairy mole.

647
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,211
He had a scar on his forehead...

648
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,046
and still has.

649
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:44,092
It was closer to his eyebrow.

650
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,804
It was here.

651
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:49,723
I ought to know.

652
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:52,893
He fell in the barn, I picked him up.

653
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,729
Also... Open your mouth.

654
01:11:57,815 --> 01:11:59,483
He broke two teeth.

655
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,235
There they are,

656
01:12:01,944 --> 01:12:03,320
in the back.

657
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,907
And a pushed-in thumbnail.

658
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:14,915
So you maintain
that he is Martin Guerre?

659
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,585
I'm sure, sir.

660
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:21,171
As sure as night follows day.

661
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,840
May I speak?

662
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:24,299
Speak.

663
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:27,302
I've seen death.

664
01:12:28,262 --> 01:12:30,681
I heard the rear of cannons

665
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:33,100
and the screams of the wounded.

666
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:39,648
You wish me ill, uncle,
but I've lived through worse.

667
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:45,487
But must that be a man's fate
for wanting to live a little

668
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:48,115
before returning to his family,

669
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:50,909
to work the land God gave us?

670
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,287
Don't let him talk any more!

671
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,291
He's clever with words.

672
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,710
We know who he is now.

673
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:03,005
All he wanted
was my nephew's property.

674
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:06,133
I don't want to take it,

675
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:08,802
I'm defending it!

676
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,139
He's not my nephew.

677
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:15,392
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it.

678
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:18,312
Cobbler, step forward.

679
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,984
Is it sure they'll let me go?

680
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:28,363
If I say what I have to say,
can I leave?

681
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:32,159
I guarantee you'll return
to your village.

682
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:38,624
Before he left, Martin Guerre

683
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:40,751
had a very large foot.

684
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,380
His size was 12 points.

685
01:13:49,176 --> 01:13:51,011
After he came back...

686
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:55,349
his size was only 9 points.

687
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,519
You're quite sure?

688
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:02,189
Yes.

689
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:05,359
In my trade,
I've seen feet grow bigger,

690
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:09,237
but I've never known feet to shrink.

691
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,116
You're getting old!

692
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,161
Your sight's going...
You forget things.

693
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,956
I see better than you, you old mule!

694
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:21,249
You see where your interest lies!

695
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,212
Jacmette, your fingers remember.

696
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:40,811
Tell them who I am.

697
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:43,438
Tell the truth.

698
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,830
You're Martin Guerre.

699
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,419
Bertrande, my wife,

700
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,504
you know me better than anyone.

701
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:11,341
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield.

702
01:15:12,259 --> 01:15:15,387
Swear it on the Holy Gospel.

703
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:18,098
You won't swear it?

704
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:22,144
Therefore I am your husband?

705
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,439
You are my husband.

706
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:33,697
Step forward, Bertrande.

707
01:15:47,294 --> 01:15:48,628
And this cross?

708
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,548
I didn't draw it.

709
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,387
Then why didn't you protest?

710
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,347
They threatened me.

711
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:00,640
Who?

712
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:01,975
To throw me out.

713
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:03,977
She's lying!

714
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:06,772
- That cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!

715
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:09,316
They'll do anything!
They tried to kill me!

716
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,318
It's her mark.

717
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:13,528
I saw her sign it.

718
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,405
I didn't sign!

719
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,367
I would have signed my name.

720
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:24,331
How? You can't write.

721
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:27,584
I'd like a quill and some paper.

722
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:10,418
Pierre, how long are we staying here?

723
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:12,129
I don't know...

724
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,548
As long as it takes.

725
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:23,890
Who pays for it?

726
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:25,392
I'll pay you.

727
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,603
Enough to live on. That's the law.

728
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,649
Who is Bertrande de Rols?

729
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:35,277
Why do you want her?

730
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:37,571
She is to be housed separately.

731
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:49,791
You see me, Blessed Virgin Mary.

732
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,086
You see the distress and sorrow I'm in.

733
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,258
I'm begging you, help me.

734
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:01,595
Protect me.

735
01:18:05,599 --> 01:18:09,853
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?

736
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:12,606
Accused, sit down and stay seated!

737
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,274
Continue.

738
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,443
Continue.

739
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:18,778
Didn't he?

740
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:22,115
Money to pay for killing me!

741
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,120
Call Dominge Pailhas.

742
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:30,123
Is he here?

743
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:35,462
Come forward.

744
01:18:46,348 --> 01:18:47,891
Don't be afraid.

745
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:50,810
Tell the truth.

746
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:53,897
Did Pierre offer you money?

747
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,483
Be honest. Yes or no?

748
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:01,154
Yes, he offered me money.

749
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,367
I said I wouldn't kill a relative,

750
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:06,993
even for money.

751
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:10,038
I'm sort of related to Martin.

752
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,832
It's true, that's what he said.

753
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:18,922
Thank you.

754
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,258
Go back to your seat.

755
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:23,176
Jeanne, come here.

756
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:28,056
Speak up now.

757
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:31,685
Didn't uncle
urge my wife to accuse me?

758
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:38,525
It's true.

759
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,113
Didn't he threaten to throw her out?

760
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,865
Yes, it's true.

761
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,536
Didn't he raise his hand to her?

762
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,415
It's a lie!

763
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,375
Silence!

764
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:02,841
Let me talk to her husband.

765
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:06,303
- Augustin, come here.
- The accused will remain seated!

766
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:10,307
Augustin, come here!

767
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:15,228
You lived under our roof.

768
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,606
After the soldier had been there,

769
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,151
you said: be careful.

770
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:25,322
My uncle was sending people after me
to beat me up.

771
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:27,324
Remember?

772
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:29,451
To teach me a lesson.

773
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:33,079
You must remember!

774
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:37,584
We'd beaten the Vals team 4-2,
a Sunday in August!

775
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:44,758
I remember.

776
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:47,635
It's true.

777
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:50,263
So, uncle,

778
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:53,016
you thought I'd never find out?

779
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:57,479
He's the impostor, the criminal!

780
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:59,939
He should be sitting here.

781
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:07,280
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...

782
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:10,241
who profaned God...

783
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:11,785
What do I care?

784
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,622
I'm not Arnaud of Tihl!

785
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,170
I'm not that man!

786
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:30,011
I'm not that man.

787
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:55,537
The man's memory is prodigious...

788
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:57,914
and he's very clever.

789
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,502
What if he were a demon?

790
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:08,091
It has happened before.

791
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:11,219
Demons like to enter human beings

792
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:13,346
and poison their minds.

793
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,684
What do you think?

794
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:24,941
Lies have a thousand faces...

795
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:27,360
even the Demon's.

796
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:30,697
Truth has only one.

797
01:22:31,698 --> 01:22:33,366
And justice exists...

798
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,702
to discover the truth.

799
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:38,079
He knew everything.

800
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:41,374
Better than anyone in the village.

801
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:44,586
When he came back...

802
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:48,214
he knew my sons' names!

803
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,927
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move.

804
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:56,556
I felt that I was...

805
01:22:57,765 --> 01:22:58,892
on fire!

806
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:09,736
I'm sure he uses magic.

807
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,740
Even here, with all of us!

808
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,784
Since the world began,

809
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,287
Satan has had a store of magic.

810
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:22,749
How can he know so much?

811
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:25,585
And have all the answers?

812
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,255
He is the Devil's emissary.

813
01:23:29,506 --> 01:23:31,758
Perhaps he is a devil himself.

814
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,177
I'm not a devil!

815
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:36,596
Silence! Sit down!

816
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:40,517
If a devil is in you,

817
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:41,809
speak.

818
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:43,937
Tell us his name.

819
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,650
A devil? Then I'd be with my wife!

820
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,944
I wouldn't have been arrested!

821
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:52,946
I wouldn't be here!

822
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:58,785
He answered well.

823
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,539
There is no proof of any magic.

824
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,625
What should we do?

825
01:24:06,793 --> 01:24:08,044
Any suggestions?

826
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:12,382
The most humane solution...

827
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:16,302
Presume innocence
if guilt is not proven.

828
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,348
But first...

829
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,977
I'd like another chance to question

830
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:27,355
Martin Guerre's wife.

831
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:46,249
The Court turns to you.

832
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:52,088
Now...

833
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,508
and for the last time...

834
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:58,011
I ask you...

835
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,889
if that man is your husband.

836
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:04,892
Yes, I'm sure.

837
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,815
How can you be absolutely certain?

838
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:14,861
Speak. We are here to learn all.

839
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:25,038
On his return, he knew all about me.

840
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,712
Did he know intimate details,

841
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:34,922
only a husband could know?

842
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:45,725
What?

843
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,102
What details?

844
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,904
He knew when I wanted him...

845
01:25:58,946 --> 01:26:00,907
and the words to say...

846
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:02,492
before...

847
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,286
during... and after.

848
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,003
The Court...

849
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:18,508
will now retire to deliberate.

850
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:29,477
I think that does it.

851
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:35,441
This peasant seems
to have won his case.

852
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:36,943
He's Martin Guerre.

853
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,987
It would be inhuman not to free him.

854
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,989
We'll clear his name.

855
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:46,494
Could anyone else
have defended him better?

856
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:35,585
In the name of the King
and of his justice...

857
01:27:36,753 --> 01:27:38,045
this Parliament...

858
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:39,380
Mr. President!

859
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:41,382
...hereby declares

860
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:44,677
that the accused is indeed...

861
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,599
is indeed Martin...

862
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:56,439
One moment, gentlemen.

863
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:01,611
A new witness insists on being heard.

864
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,531
Have him come forward.

865
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:57,416
You claim to be Martin Guerre?

866
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,086
Yes, that's my name.

867
01:29:02,088 --> 01:29:03,339
Silence!

868
01:29:05,675 --> 01:29:07,510
Stay where you are!

869
01:29:10,972 --> 01:29:12,265
Where were you?

870
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:14,433
In Picardy. The Army.

871
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,771
I lost my leg at Saint-Quentin.

872
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:23,192
Back in Artigat,
I heard what was happening.

873
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:24,610
Here I am.

874
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,864
Do you know that man?

875
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:33,494
We soldiered together.

876
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:36,122
Do you know his name?

877
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:39,083
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette.

878
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,377
Don't listen! Look at them...

879
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:44,130
Having lost, they try a last ruse!

880
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:47,133
A beggar, hired by my uncle!

881
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:54,307
Do you know that woman?

882
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:04,859
Bertrande, my wife.

883
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:07,236
It's one last low trick!

884
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,196
Accused, stay in your seat!

885
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:13,826
You wrong me and you insult me?

886
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:16,162
Wrong you?

887
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:19,540
I've never laid eyes on you!

888
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:24,712
Why don't you arrest him?
He's a hired liar!

889
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:26,547
Silence, both of you.

890
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,008
Pierre Guerre, step forward.

891
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:30,593
You and your wife.

892
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,230
Do you know this man?

893
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:46,359
Yes...

894
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:49,528
Yes, I recognize him.

895
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,573
Martin, my nephew.

896
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:57,036
Let me embrace you, Martin.

897
01:30:59,956 --> 01:31:01,457
At last you're back.

898
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,251
You're quite sure?

899
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:07,380
He's my brother's son.

900
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:09,548
And you?

901
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:14,220
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God.

902
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:16,263
Arrest him!

903
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:18,265
Stay seated!

904
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:23,104
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...

905
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:25,606
just in time, like a miracle!

906
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:26,774
It's God's doing.

907
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:31,278
The hand of God, manifesting itself!

908
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:32,947
It's divine justice.

909
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:34,949
God has sent him

910
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:36,450
to prevent injustice!

911
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:43,499
To your seats!
Return to your seats!

912
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:56,429
Don't forsake me!

913
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:01,017
It's a plot against me.

914
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:04,020
In my own family!

915
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,147
You sir, above all.

916
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:10,192
Please listen to me once more

917
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:11,652
or else I'm lost.

918
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:15,114
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat.

919
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:17,408
He's a paid liar.

920
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:21,829
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him.

921
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:25,708
Let me put him to the test!

922
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:33,174
Do it.

923
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:41,515
You claim to be me. Tell me...

924
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,351
On my wedding night

925
01:32:45,478 --> 01:32:48,064
who gave us the nuptial bowl?

926
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:56,322
She did.

927
01:32:57,198 --> 01:32:59,366
Catherine. She tucked us in.

928
01:33:01,077 --> 01:33:04,497
I was bewitched.
How many masses were said for me?

929
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:11,337
It's so long ago and I'm tired.

930
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:18,344
Answer!

931
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:22,389
- Six...
- He's wrong!

932
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:24,225
He doesn't know!

933
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,851
Not six... four!

934
01:33:26,769 --> 01:33:28,354
Answer, you know.

935
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:30,523
Tell the truth before God.

936
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:33,567
I said four masses, it's true.

937
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:43,744
You should have been better informed.

938
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,414
Where was the spell broken?

939
01:33:47,706 --> 01:33:49,208
At the priest's.

940
01:33:50,543 --> 01:33:52,419
Was it hot or cold?

941
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:53,921
Cold... I was naked.

942
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:57,633
That's true! I was naked.

943
01:33:58,384 --> 01:34:00,261
We warmed up quickly!

944
01:34:04,807 --> 01:34:09,395
Who bought the sacks of grain I stole?

945
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:12,815
Smallpox André.

946
01:34:13,482 --> 01:34:15,568
You learned that lesson well...

947
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:21,407
Another thing...

948
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:25,995
When I went away, what did I leave
in the linen-chest upstairs?

949
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:29,623
What did I leave?

950
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:32,001
I left it! What was it?

951
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,509
White breeches!

952
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:42,553
Sewn by Bertrande.

953
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:43,971
And you didn't know.

954
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,682
- I told you about them!
- I told you!

955
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:48,684
Don't twist it around!

956
01:34:48,809 --> 01:34:50,144
Arrest him!

957
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:52,479
I've proven I'm Martin Guerre!

958
01:34:53,022 --> 01:34:54,481
One moment.

959
01:34:55,608 --> 01:34:57,318
You say you told him?

960
01:34:57,443 --> 01:34:59,653
And he's trying to use it!

961
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,780
But before you said...

962
01:35:02,448 --> 01:35:04,325
you didn't know him.

963
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:15,961
Accused, sit down.

964
01:35:20,299 --> 01:35:22,301
The sisters, come here.

965
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:35,731
Which one is your brother?

966
01:35:37,316 --> 01:35:39,151
Make up your minds.

967
01:35:49,495 --> 01:35:50,996
This is my brother.

968
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:55,542
It's Martin Guerre.

969
01:35:55,668 --> 01:35:58,045
No, you're making a mistake!

970
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,672
And you, Guillemette?

971
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:03,509
What do you say?

972
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:06,512
I can't remember.

973
01:36:07,054 --> 01:36:08,555
I was too little.

974
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:11,684
Maybe it's him.

975
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:13,394
He's my father!

976
01:36:13,519 --> 01:36:17,690
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!

977
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:19,191
Silence!

978
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:21,527
I order you to be quiet!

979
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:26,782
Catherine Boëre, come here.

980
01:36:30,369 --> 01:36:31,745
What do you say?

981
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:33,247
Me?

982
01:36:33,372 --> 01:36:34,957
Yes, you. What do you say?

983
01:36:35,082 --> 01:36:36,542
Of no importance...

984
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:38,627
I'm not family.

985
01:36:38,752 --> 01:36:41,422
Catherine... Tell them.

986
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:22,087
Forgive me, Martin.

987
01:37:23,589 --> 01:37:26,592
Don't cry...
Women cry easily.

988
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:30,596
You should have known
your own husband.

989
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,641
Our house is dishonored.

990
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:37,269
It's all your fault.

991
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:43,609
You're to blame, Martin.

992
01:37:48,697 --> 01:37:50,991
You betrayed my friendship.

993
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:54,161
You deserve no pity.

994
01:38:00,793 --> 01:38:04,963
What harm in caring for a woman
her husband deserted?

995
01:38:09,635 --> 01:38:11,637
We await your confession...

996
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:14,306
Arnaud of Tihl.

997
01:38:22,648 --> 01:38:23,899
It's true.

998
01:38:26,693 --> 01:38:28,487
We soldiered together.

999
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:34,660
He talked about his wife...

1000
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,912
his son, his house...

1001
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:41,542
One day on the road,
two men took me for him

1002
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:43,710
They called me Martin.

1003
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,921
It gave me an idea.

1004
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:47,923
I thought...

1005
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:54,221
Why not take his place?

1006
01:39:00,686 --> 01:39:02,729
So I learned all I could.

1007
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:05,691
Martin said he wasn't coming back.

1008
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,862
I went to Artigat,

1009
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:11,738
I was taken for him.

1010
01:39:16,702 --> 01:39:18,245
I almost told them:

1011
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:21,707
"I fooled you! Martin's up north!"

1012
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,750
I almost said it.

1013
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:29,715
Then I saw you.

1014
01:39:34,094 --> 01:39:35,721
I took you in my arms.

1015
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:41,393
Next day, it was too late.

1016
01:39:44,813 --> 01:39:48,066
After that,
I learned whatever I didn't know

1017
01:39:48,317 --> 01:39:51,403
from my uncle, sisters, wife.

1018
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,907
And I remembered it.

1019
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:08,795
There's no magic in it.

1020
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:12,090
I swear it.

1021
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:23,936
You don't deserve her.

1022
01:40:24,978 --> 01:40:26,980
I know her better than you do.

1023
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:38,992
I ask you all to forgive me.

1024
01:40:39,785 --> 01:40:40,994
You.

1025
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:43,622
Them.

1026
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:47,960
And you...

1027
01:40:49,628 --> 01:40:51,171
who were my wife.

1028
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:12,484
Your men can stay in the barn.

1029
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:17,072
Pierre Guerre,
you brought discord to this village.

1030
01:41:17,364 --> 01:41:19,575
Now keep the peace.

1031
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:35,048
Leave us, please.

1032
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:07,873
I'm thirsty.

1033
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:26,642
You have dared much
and feared God very little.

1034
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:33,732
We hesitated
before declaring you innocent.

1035
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:40,781
It was unwise
to take that stranger into your bed.

1036
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:45,494
Women are often the victims

1037
01:42:45,619 --> 01:42:47,245
of men's wickedness.

1038
01:42:53,919 --> 01:42:56,254
That's why we acquitted you.

1039
01:42:58,173 --> 01:42:59,966
And legitimated...

1040
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:02,678
your daughter's birth.

1041
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:04,971
We hope that now...

1042
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:08,809
you will be a good wife.

1043
01:43:11,603 --> 01:43:14,356
But tell me, between us...

1044
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:16,441
so I'll understand...

1045
01:43:22,114 --> 01:43:24,658
Before Arnaud appeared,

1046
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,702
you needed a man?

1047
01:43:30,497 --> 01:43:32,833
And this one pleased you?

1048
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:40,048
Did he satisfy your need?

1049
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,638
You loved each other?

1050
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:54,146
You knew from the start?

1051
01:43:55,397 --> 01:43:56,648
You can tell me.

1052
01:43:57,149 --> 01:43:58,984
It will go no farther.

1053
01:44:05,157 --> 01:44:06,575
Arnaud and I...

1054
01:44:09,828 --> 01:44:11,538
were good together.

1055
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,002
Martin had neglected me.

1056
01:44:19,004 --> 01:44:20,839
Arnaud respected me...

1057
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,842
like a true husband.

1058
01:44:26,011 --> 01:44:27,888
I trusted him completely.

1059
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:35,562
We thought of asking to be judged.

1060
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:39,107
We could have won.

1061
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:48,617
If Martin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife.

1062
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:52,078
No one could've denied it.

1063
01:44:53,914 --> 01:44:55,248
At the last minute...

1064
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:57,626
why did you change?

1065
01:45:00,128 --> 01:45:01,797
Why choose Martin?

1066
01:45:09,054 --> 01:45:10,806
In Arnaud's eyes...

1067
01:45:14,893 --> 01:45:16,937
I saw it was hopeless.

1068
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:23,568
I saw what he wanted.

1069
01:45:33,078 --> 01:45:34,913
He wanted me to live...

1070
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:38,083
for me and my children.

1071
01:45:41,086 --> 01:45:42,754
So I did it.

1072
01:46:06,278 --> 01:46:09,114
God forgive me, I defiled marriage.

1073
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:12,117
The King, the law,

1074
01:46:12,701 --> 01:46:14,619
all those I offended...

1075
01:46:17,122 --> 01:46:18,123
forgive me.

1076
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,795
Stand up, Arnaud.

1077
01:46:42,522 --> 01:46:43,732
Guards!

1078
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:45,525
Open the door.

1079
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:13,386
God forgive me,

1080
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:16,222
I defiled marriage.

1081
01:47:16,848 --> 01:47:20,185
The King, the law...

1082
01:47:21,186 --> 01:47:23,730
all those I offended, forgive me.

1083
01:48:34,467 --> 01:48:36,469
Commend your soul to God.

1084
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:58,533
The story of the false Martin Guerre

1085
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:00,702
ended that morning.

1086
01:49:02,287 --> 01:49:06,166
The Councillor, Jean of Coras,
impressed

1087
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:10,462
by this daring imposture,
made a record of it.

1088
01:49:11,463 --> 01:49:12,964
12 years later...

1089
01:49:13,798 --> 01:49:16,051
came the St Bartholomew Massacre.

1090
01:49:16,718 --> 01:49:19,179
For his Protestant beliefs,

1091
01:49:19,304 --> 01:49:23,516
Jean de Coras was hanged
before the Toulouse Parliament

1092
01:49:24,059 --> 01:49:25,977
with a hundred of his friends.

1093
01:49:28,354 --> 01:49:31,149
But we live only by the spirit.

1094
01:49:32,317 --> 01:49:34,069
All else dies.
