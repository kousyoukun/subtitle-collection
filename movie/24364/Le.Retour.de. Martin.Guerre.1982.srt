THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE
马丁·盖尔返乡记

2
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,722
On this St Michael's Sunday
in the church of Artigat,
今天是圣·迈克尔的礼拜天，在阿提卡教堂

3
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,143
we receive Bertrande de Rols,
我们邀请到罗尔斯·贝特朗

4
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,895
daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols
罗尔斯·劳伦的女儿

5
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,481
and of Raimonde, his wife.

6
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,984
And we receive Martin Guerre,

7
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,486
son of Mathurin Guerre

8
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,447
and of Brigitte, his wife.

9
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,924
I, Martin,
give my body to thee, Bertrande.

10
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,762
I accept it
and give my body to thee, Martin.

11
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,097
I accept it.

12
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,354
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony.

13
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,778
You will not regret
having followed this story

14
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,824
for it is neither a tale of adventure

15
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,784
nor an imaginary fable.

16
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,289
It is a true story.

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,962
It began one August Sunday, in 1542,

18
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,967
in the village of Artigat,
county of Foix,

19
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,012
in the reign of Francis I.

20
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:47,061
Bertrande, at her parents' decision,

21
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,314
brings a dowry of 30 acres of wheat

22
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,026
and 40 of millet,
at the place called Pomarede.

23
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,073
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods,

24
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,370
inherited from her father Laurent,
deceased.

25
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,167
Three red dresses,
a bed and two feather pillows,

26
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,836
one linen-chest with lock and key.

27
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,005
That's all.

28
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,174
Catherine.

29
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,343
Something to drink.

30
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,848
If you still agree, sign here.

31
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,029
You'll have to blow hard, my boy!

32
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,923
It's a good match, well arranged.

33
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,802
May the Lord bless this bed
with health...

34
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,477
and keep the Demon from this house.

35
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,938
Kiss her, Father.

36
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,489
Martin, tender buds
need to be sprinkled at night.

37
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,409
You two, kiss your brother.

38
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,750
Make us some pretty grandchildren!

39
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,345
The rest, you can do without me.

40
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,190
Whenever you want,
come eat and dance.

41
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,132
Make room!

42
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,592
Carry on, sir.

43
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,386
That's her.

44
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,180
That is Bertrande de Rols.

45
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:23,360
You say at first your husband couldn't
consummate your marriage. Why not?

46
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:28,240
Because of the spell
that had been cast on him.

47
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,328
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?

48
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,374
Yes... but I didn't.

49
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,795
I was married...

50
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,381
I felt bound to him.

51
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,216
People knew?

52
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,595
Of course.
We had no children.

53
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,805
They made fun of him?

54
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,892
Yes... the whole village.

55
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,231
Tell me what happened
that Candlemas Day.

56
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:51,865
A serenade for Bertrande
and her husband!

57
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,124
If you're tired of sleeping at night
change husbands!

58
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,837
Change husbands
if you want to have children!

59
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,159
Don't be afraid.

60
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,081
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament.

61
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,710
I am now in charge of this matter.

62
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,509
You must tell me everything.

63
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,345
Even if the priest said not to.

64
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,099
It's caused by evil thoughts.

65
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,019
They put a spell on you.

66
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,022
I'll take it away.

67
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,203
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you.

68
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,914
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you.

69
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,375
Blessed Flesh, I make you grow again.

70
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,093
Accursed Demon,
leave this servant of the Lord!

71
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,513
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin

72
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,266
whose flesh is suffering.

73
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,436
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin

74
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,772
whose flesh is suffering.

75
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,317
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Bertrande

76
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,569
whose flesh is suffering.

77
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,285
And do your best to help things along.

78
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,412
And that worked?

79
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,749
That very day, yes.

80
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,420
We had a son.

81
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,589
His name is Sanxi.

82
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,301
So all was well.

83
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,597
For me, yes, but Martin...

84
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,686
Martin kept to himself.

85
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,439
He didn't even look at our son.

86
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,610
He didn't like farming.

87
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,446
He and his father argued.

88
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,123
You want us to die of thirst?

89
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,842
Where were you?

90
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,469
You can't do anything right!

91
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,140
I was with some soldiers,
at the stream.

92
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,326
Two sacks of grain are gone.
You seen them?

93
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,412
You stole them.

94
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,707
You loaded the grain.
You stole them!

95
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,544
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!

96
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,839
I'll make you hate
the taste of bread!

97
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,383
I didn't take them!

98
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,886
While I'm alive, I'm the master here!

99
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,568
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?

100
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,198
Wear them Sunday.

101
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,204
You cut them too big.

102
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,873
You wasted your time.

103
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,708
You always scold me.

104
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,927
It's not my fault.

105
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,763
Be nice sometimes.

106
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,559
I'm sorry.

107
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,573
That was the night he left.

108
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,660
Why steal the grain?

109
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,081
Did he know he was leaving?

110
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,625
And needed money?

111
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,460
Maybe. I don't know.

112
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,004
He didn't talk much to me.

113
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,096
What did you think?

114
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,683
That he'd be back soon.

115
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,436
Everyone thought so.

116
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,857
That his father had scared him.

117
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,443
He waited for Martin
every day for months.

118
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,781
Finally he died... killed by sorrow.

119
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,826
Martin's mother died a year later.

120
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,173
Your mother got married again?

121
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:43,884
Yes.

122
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,179
To Pierre Guerre, my husband's uncle.

123
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,016
To keep the farms together?

124
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,310
No doubt.

125
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,646
Our lands are now held in common.

126
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,497
The wolves are out tonight.

127
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,542
Make sure the animals are locked up.

128
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,503
Yes, mother.
I do it every night.

129
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,317
You little rat!

130
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,280
Filthy rat!

131
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,741
Did Martin stay away long?

132
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,411
Eight winters, or nine.

133
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,789
You never heard from him?

134
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,501
No... Nothing.

135
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,088
But I'm sure
you had no lack of admirers.

136
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,757
No, but I kept my virtue.

137
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,927
Speak up, we can't hear you.

138
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,304
I kept my virtue.

139
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,266
Ask anyone. I remained chaste.

140
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,436
You never forgot Martin?

141
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,861
I prayed to St Catherine
to send him back.

142
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,824
So many seasons passed...

143
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,163
Then she heard me.

144
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,824
Hello, there.

145
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,704
Who are you?

146
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,917
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?

147
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,668
Who are you?

148
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,215
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely.

149
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,428
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

150
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,690
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?

151
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,863
- Is it you, Martin?
- You bet it is!

152
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,869
You're back!

153
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,751
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son.

154
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,045
No, Jacques is my brother.

155
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,131
Right...

156
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,716
You're "Smallpox André".

157
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,899
Remember the bear hunt,
when Nicolas "castrated" me?

158
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,319
Made me miserable, didn't you?

159
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,074
Martin Guerre is back!

160
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,076
You're bigger, Martin.

161
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,412
War does that.

162
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,460
Martin Guerre is back!

163
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,130
- What are you saying?
- You've seen him?

164
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,090
Yes! He's down the road.

165
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,981
Guillemette, your brother!

166
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,609
- Are you sure?
- I saw him!

167
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,402
The son of Mathurin?

168
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,447
Bertrande, your husband's back!

169
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,993
Come, it's your husband.

170
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,650
You still here?

171
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,985
Hello, Barthélemy.

172
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:41,241
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!

173
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,014
Hello, Jeanne, sister.

174
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,016
Martin! At last!

175
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,394
You've changed!

176
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,067
Where's your husband?

177
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,035
Are you Guillemette?

178
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,876
You were so small when I left!

179
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,715
Come kiss your brother!

180
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,640
Sanxi?

181
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,440
You're so big.

182
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,443
Don't be afraid.

183
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,113
Come nearer.

184
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,158
I'm your father.

185
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,305
Hello, uncle.

186
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,142
You were gone a long time.

187
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,772
That's true.

188
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,275
Forgive me for what I did.

189
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,156
Your father and mother are dead.

190
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,660
I heard, and I prayed for them.

191
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,707
I also heard you married Raimonde...

192
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,127
my wife's mother.

193
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,798
It's good news.

194
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,135
My daughter has suffered.

195
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,348
Have you changed for the better?

196
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,275
You're here...

197
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,820
It's all true!

198
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,323
Is it really you?

199
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,167
Is it you, Catherine?

200
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,213
You haven't changed.

201
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,180
I wondered if you'd ever come back.

202
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,852
And here you are, safe and sound.

203
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,332
- Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house.

204
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,043
She's waiting for you.

205
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,050
To the wash-house!

206
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,915
It's me.

207
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,815
It's me. Martin.

208
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,833
Hello, Martin.

209
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,644
My God, my wife is beautiful.

210
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,344
It is a gift of God
that you have returned.

211
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,899
He was in the Army in Picardy.

212
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,243
Don't you recognize me?

213
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,621
Who are you?

214
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,040
It's me. Nicolas.

215
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,137
It's confusing, seeing you all.

216
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,632
Here's cloth from Flanders.

217
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,510
The nicest for Bertrande, with lace.

218
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,436
Catherine, take the last one.

219
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,497
You've learned to read?

220
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,881
And to write, too.

221
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,843
To write?

222
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,691
What did you do all this time?

223
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,657
I fought in the war.

224
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,536
I even went to Spain.

225
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,545
Then I wanted to see you.

226
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,597
All of you.

227
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,474
What's Spain like?

228
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,517
It's dry.

229
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,771
And Paris? Did you see Paris?

230
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,524
It's big.

231
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,612
There are people everywhere.

232
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,531
I even got lost there.

233
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,711
There are thieves at night.

234
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,465
You're so strong now, Martin!

235
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,509
This calls for a celebration!

236
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,096
When you left here, Martin...

237
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,724
you didn't have a beard yet.

238
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,769
And you didn't drink as much!

239
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,398
Now I drink like a monk!

240
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,985
After war...

241
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,112
Peace!

242
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,948
To you, my wife.

243
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,628
A little rough, but not bad.

244
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,422
Just enough to kill the worms!

245
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,109
I'll prepare your bed.

246
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,789
It's good to be on your own land.

247
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,668
What are you looking for?

248
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,795
The candles.

249
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,463
In there.

250
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:23,841
You moved them?

251
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,469
No, they've always been there.

252
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,807
Then I forgot.

253
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,545
She cried a lot because of you.

254
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,424
Remember, Bertrande?

255
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,719
Go get my white breeches,

256
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,513
the one lined with silk,

257
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,684
from the linen-chest.

258
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,773
If they're still there.

259
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:28,948
<i>I'll go.</i>

260
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,120
You've found your smile.

261
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,388
"The bird's back in the nest.
Tonight they will not rest."

262
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,954
They're still here.

263
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,750
Waiting for you, like me.

264
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,350
I'll wear them tomorrow.

265
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,641
How often I've wanted you...

266
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,073
I'm here only because of you.

267
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,871
So everyone recognized him?

268
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,706
Yes, everyone.

269
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,917
His sisters...

270
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,877
His uncle...

271
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,588
Catherine, the servant?

272
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,590
His friends...
The whole village.

273
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,219
You, too?

274
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,097
Me, too.

275
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,100
Without hesitation?

276
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,608
Then what?

277
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,195
He took up his work,
his place at home.

278
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,407
We had two children.

279
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,034
The first died.

280
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,286
The second is alive, a girl.

281
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,871
18 months old.

282
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,459
And everything went well?

283
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,044
Very well.

284
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,296
Better than before?

285
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,464
Yes.

286
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,884
And he worked hard.

287
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,263
Our harvests have never been better.

288
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,266
And between you two?

289
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,893
It's been good.

290
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,733
When did the doubts first begin?

291
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,904
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn.

292
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,923
YOu!

293
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,468
A game for 15 points?

294
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,763
I don't gamble.

295
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,353
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy relic?

296
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,106
Go to the devil, we have a priest!

297
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,278
I'm going back.

298
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,951
I'll play-

299
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,954
Dominique, play with me.

300
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,624
No, I think not. Like Martin.

301
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,502
Come on, Father. Only 15 points.

302
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,469
Who is he?

303
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,387
It's Martin.

304
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,477
Martin Guerra,
who went away and came back.

305
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,270
Like the prodigal son.

306
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,065
He's not Martin Guerre.

307
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,651
I knew Martin Guerre.

308
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,656
At the battle of Saint-Quentin.

309
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,409
In fact, he lost a leg there.

310
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,203
Of course, it's Martin.

311
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:30,040
I ought to know,
I'm the one who married him.

312
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,833
But it's not.

313
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,045
He's...

314
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,049
What's his name again?

315
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,013
I knew him on the Army, too.

316
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,182
It's Martin!

317
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,851
We're even related.

318
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,188
I tell you he's not Martin.

319
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,066
He's Pansette!

320
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,859
That's it.

321
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,861
Pansefie.

322
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,200
He's from the village of Tihl.

323
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,245
I knew him in Picardie, too.

324
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,917
What's he doing here?

325
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,045
I saw two of those people in Arras.

326
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,548
From a land called Brazil.

327
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,056
Their bodies were all painted.

328
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,477
They had feathers on their heads.

329
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,646
It's true, Sanxi.

330
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,654
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us.

331
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,455
They were in chains,
and made to dance.

332
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,090
In their own country, they go naked.

333
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,635
Even the women?

334
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,180
Sounds like a nice country.

335
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,265
Then you should go there.

336
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,984
They eat their prisoners' hearts.

337
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,114
Are they human?

338
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,909
Do they have a soul?

339
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,702
The monks say they do.

340
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,961
In some tribes,
they share their land and their women.

341
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:45,300
In others, the women go to war
and make all the decisions.

342
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:53,308
The day women rule here,

343
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,686
it'll be the end of the world.

344
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,236
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind.

345
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,354
No! Let's go home, I'm afraid.

346
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,066
Why?

347
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,365
See! A circle of smoke.

348
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,034
Spirits will be out.

349
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,037
We mustn't look at them.

350
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,557
Pansette! What are you doing?

351
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,101
Leaving us already?

352
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,315
Trying to find your way?

353
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,777
When are you going?

354
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,906
Did you come to the wrong village?

355
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,462
It's you!
Doesn't surprise me, idiot!

356
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,135
He's strong!

357
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,804
Not like Martin. Right, Bertrande?

358
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,600
Pansette, you look true
but you play false.

359
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,603
Beware!

360
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,448
Where was this soldier from?

361
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,617
A garrison in Picardy.

362
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,460
Don't believe tales told by strangers.

363
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,129
And by drunks.

364
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,298
Or by rogues.

365
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,343
He's right.

366
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,474
"Lies come easy from afar."

367
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,314
We know Martin well.

368
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,216
If anyone knows Martin...

369
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,386
it's us.

370
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,803
We must do our accounts one day.

371
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,432
How much my land earned
in my absence.

372
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,393
What do you mean?

373
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:11,399
You worked my land and I'm grateful,
but it made a profit.

374
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,568
Now I need the money.

375
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,238
I figure it's about 6000 livres.

376
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:21,242
You dare ask me for an accounting?

377
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:27,457
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?

378
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,460
I, who protected your wife?

379
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,423
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?

380
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,761
It was your duty!
I went to war, I have a right to it!

381
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,596
You have no right. You left!

382
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,974
Yes, I have!
I have the law on my side.

383
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,645
I'll seek justice, if I must.

384
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,315
You'll be condemned.

385
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,442
You threaten your uncle?

386
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,532
I need that money.

387
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,123
I'll sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pujol's.

388
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,126
To plant barley.

389
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,464
You want to sell your father's field?

390
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,509
It's too steep for planting.

391
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,472
You're starting
to squander our property!

392
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,809
But I expected it.

393
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,478
I'm not surprised.

394
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,648
I warn you...

395
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,152
Martin or not Martin...

396
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,738
you won't get away with it!

397
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,489
What did you say?

398
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,325
Repeat that!

399
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,911
What did you say?

400
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,498
Let go of me!

401
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,546
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too.

402
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,590
The whole village did.

403
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,508
You all welcomed him.

404
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,763
Look at Bertrande.

405
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,183
She's not complaining.

406
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,101
She's never looked better.

407
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,687
When he came back,

408
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,190
he'd been gone a long time.

409
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,197
What if we were all mistaken?

410
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,368
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?

411
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,414
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief.

412
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,210
You're right to stand up to him.

413
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:39,964
You be careful, too.

414
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:46,095
After me, it'll be your turn.

415
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,932
He'll wipe your ass.

416
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,310
And take your shirt!

417
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:58,233
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again.

418
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,237
Leaving you your eyes to cry with.

419
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,406
Then you'll see
what kind of man he is!

420
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,756
The work isn't finished!

421
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,803
I'm ashamed of you, uncle.

422
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,293
My father wants you.

423
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,796
I'm coming.

424
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,520
What do you want?

425
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,814
I've thought it over.

426
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:25,403
You're right.
I have the money.

427
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,823
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you.

428
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,701
I don't want any trouble.

429
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,836
Know where your father hid money?

430
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,759
No, he never told me.

431
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,680
In the hay-loft above the stable.

432
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:05,526
I'll wait for you there
at cook's crow.

433
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,946
I'll give you your due.

434
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,791
But let's keep it to ourselves.

435
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,571
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales.

436
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,908
They're all jealous.

437
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,329
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar.

438
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,748
All they talk about is us.

439
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,627
Calm down, my uncle has understood.

440
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,504
He'll shut them up.

441
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,923
Give me your hand.

442
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,937
Let me guide you.

443
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,619
Is that her name?

444
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,957
Yes, that's my name.

445
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,063
It's in the grain chest.

446
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:20,828
You wanted it, right?

447
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,248
You wanted what we owe you?

448
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,877
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...

449
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,004
in hard cash!

450
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,844
You won't ask for it again!

451
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,225
At your service, Pansette!

452
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,895
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!

453
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,624
You were ready to die for him?

454
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,544
Yes, to protect him.

455
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,048
Explain something to me.

456
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:19,387
You defended your husband,
risking your own life.

457
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,266
But when his uncle
attacked him legally,

458
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,101
you didn't say anything.

459
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,146
You should've protested,

460
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,649
talked to the judge,

461
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,319
told everyone:
"I know he's my husband."

462
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,906
But you said nothing.

463
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,411
Why?

464
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,253
Did you have doubts, too?

465
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,674
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?

466
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,763
At one moment, I was troubled.

467
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,100
I wavered.

468
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,477
I thought...

469
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,937
Speak up.

470
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,609
I thought:
"Maybe he's fooling me, too."

471
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,488
Charming me, as he did others.

472
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,492
Then my daughter is a bastard.

473
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:29,290
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell.

474
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:33,961
Yes... I had doubts.

475
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,964
And still have?

476
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,968
No, not any more.

477
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,970
Then he is your husband?

478
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:46,015
Yes or no?

479
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,728
I say yes.

480
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,028
And what does he say?

481
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,030
The same thing, obviously.

482
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,199
He says they're man and wife.

483
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:07,411
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament.

484
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,841
Go join your family.

485
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:26,055
You are Martin Guerre?

486
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,100
Yes, lam.

487
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,435
You're quite sure?

488
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,605
I don't know of any other.

489
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:42,905
Walk on.

490
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,584
You're going TO Pay-

491
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,587
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!

492
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,173
The law will punish you,
you cheater!

493
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:04,385
You tricked us to steal our property!

494
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,803
Silence!

495
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:09,890
The family apart...

496
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,642
Over here.

497
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,159
Now listen to me, all of you.

498
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,830
Those who honestly think...

499
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,126
this man is not Martin Guerre,
to my left.

500
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,477
Shame on you, Nicolas!

501
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:03,152
Those who honestly think...

502
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:07,615
he truly is Martin Guerre,

503
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,785
to my right.

504
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:25,341
And you?

505
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,139
I am their priest.

506
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,144
But surely you have an opinion.

507
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,431
The others have no opinion?

508
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:24,233
In settlement of this dispute,

509
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,863
I, Jean de Cores,
Councillor of the Toulouse Parliament,

510
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:32,116
declare that there is no reason

511
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,035
to believe
this man is not Martin Guerre.

512
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,081
The charge is dismissed
for lack of proof.

513
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:43,419
This man shall be released.

514
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,088
Pierre Guerre is condemned

515
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,092
to pay 500 livres
to the king and to his nephew

516
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,219
for calumny.

517
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:58,976
Free him.

518
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,280
You are a knave!

519
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:14,283
God knows it
and will punish you!

520
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:18,287
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other.

521
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,461
That was an excellent judgment.

522
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,768
What happened to my brother?

523
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,022
You should be in bed.

524
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,376
On your feet.
This time we've got you.

525
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:11,960
Get dressed.

526
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,254
- What?
- Get dressed.

527
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,424
- You're under arrest.
- I was released yesterday!

528
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,594
Things changed during the night.

529
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,763
Look.

530
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,267
This time, your wife signed, too.

531
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,313
- My wife?
- Here.

532
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,198
Get dressed!
You're going to Toulouse.

533
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,993
When did she sign?

534
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:49,039
Last night,
before going to bed.

535
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,544
Is it true?

536
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,046
They made you sign?

537
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,344
Hurry UP!

538
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,306
This time, you're done for.

539
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:43,510
The accusation is the same,

540
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,723
but it will be more difficult
to answer.

541
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:51,685
- Your wife signed.
- It's a forgery!

542
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:55,898
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?

543
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,859
Her uncle and cousins scare her.

544
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,362
They might cut her throat.

545
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,365
They've threatened her?

546
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,036
Often .

547
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,123
Especially lately.

548
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:19,379
She now says you betrayed her.

549
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,925
That you're not her husband.
That's serious.

550
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,135
I know her.

551
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,221
They forced her to sign.

552
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,724
Assure her safety,

553
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,394
and ask me what you want.
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre.

554
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,608
We've heard many witnesses,

555
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,738
and we shall hear more.

556
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,411
Shall a councillor defend you?

557
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,458
I don't need help to prove who I am.

558
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,002
Who married you?

559
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,258
Father Dominique Caylar.
He's still there.

560
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,927
He doesn't like me
because I swear a lot.

561
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:12,140
We married on St Michael's day,
18 years ago.

562
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,934
Who was the notary?

563
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:20,274
Jehan Pegala, from Le Fossat.

564
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,281
He was late, my father was upset.

565
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:32,995
Bertrande's dowry
was the Roussas woods,

566
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,791
her lands at Pomarede, two oxen,

567
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,794
a bed with feather pillows,

568
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,506
and three dresses.

569
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,300
And sacks of grain.

570
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,635
Have you forgotten?

571
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,683
No.

572
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,520
No sack of grain.

573
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:10,657
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband.

574
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:13,827
That wasn't so before.

575
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,708
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left.

576
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,501
And she's changed.

577
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,505
So have I.

578
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,845
You're not stupid.

579
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,691
You know you risk death?

580
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,861
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!

581
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,114
I was his nephew
until I wanted my money.

582
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:54,910
Everyone knew me:
my sisters, my wife's mother...

583
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,745
Even my wife.

584
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,122
Others also say you're not Martin.

585
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,874
My uncle's rich!

586
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,752
They're afraid of him.

587
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,713
He acts out of self-interest.

588
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:10,300
He'd rob me of my name
and my property.

589
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,260
It's outrageous!

590
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,555
Follow me.

591
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:56,763
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?

592
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,356
You asked to see this man.

593
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,614
Do you know him?

594
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,541
Yes... It's him.

595
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:27,669
Who is he?

596
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,797
What's his name?

597
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:34,801
It's Arnaud.

598
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,810
It's Arnaud.

599
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,814
They call him Pansette.

600
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,318
Where is he from?

601
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,030
Our village.

602
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,825
- He's from Tihl.
- You're sure?

603
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,828
He left a long time ago,

604
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,914
but that's him.

605
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,502
- Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?
- No.

606
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,671
Arnaud, from Tihl.

607
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,048
Called Pansette!

608
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:14,508
Look at them.

609
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,094
Look at them!

610
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,930
They're sent by my uncle!

611
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,683
Bought and paid for!

612
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,435
Look at them.

613
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:27,521
Shame written on their faces!

614
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:30,899
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified.

615
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,194
So what?

616
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:36,863
My uncle has influence.

617
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,282
Why would I pretend?

618
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:42,369
To have a house and a wife.

619
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,915
But it's my house, and my wife!

620
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,376
I'm wronged, and I'm accused!

621
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,883
Never was a husband so maligned!

622
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,885
But I'll appeal...

623
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,471
To the Parliament, here.

624
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,890
I want my uncle to be punished!

625
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,519
So it'll all be clear!

626
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,771
I want them all here.

627
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:14,234
First Pierre,
guilty of bearing false witness.

628
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,946
Also my sisters and cousins.

629
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:23,326
And my wife who was forced to sign,
and all the villagers!

630
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,413
All those who've known me
since I was born!

631
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,361
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years!

632
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,155
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him.

633
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,992
When he left, he was thinner,

634
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,162
darker and a bit stooped.

635
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:54,376
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips.

636
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,004
And a hairy mole on his neck...

637
01:10:58,672 --> 01:10:59,881
Show us.

638
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,509
Here, on his neck.

639
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,682
There's no trace of it.

640
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,232
And a scar above his right eyebrow.

641
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:19,442
Also not there.

642
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,028
No, sir. That's wrong.

643
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,490
I knew Martin when he was little, too.

644
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,909
I diapered him,

645
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,203
and saw him naked
more often than you!

646
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,082
He had no hairy mole.

647
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,210
He had a scar on his forehead...

648
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,045
and still has.

649
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,092
It was closer to his eyebrow.

650
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,803
It was here.

651
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,723
I ought to know.

652
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,892
He fell in the barn, I picked him up.

653
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,729
Also... Open your mouth.

654
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,482
He broke two teeth.

655
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,234
There they are,

656
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,320
in the back.

657
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,906
And a pushed-in thumbnail.

658
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:14,914
So you maintain
that he is Martin Guerre?

659
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,585
I'm sure, sir.

660
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,171
As sure as night follows day.

661
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,839
May I speak?

662
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:24,299
Speak.

663
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,302
I've seen death.

664
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,680
I heard the rear of cannons

665
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:33,099
and the screams of the wounded.

666
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:39,647
You wish me ill, uncle,
but I've lived through worse.

667
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,487
But must that be a man's fate
for wanting to live a little

668
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,114
before returning to his family,

669
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,909
to work the land God gave us?

670
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,286
Don't let him talk any more!

671
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,290
He's clever with words.

672
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,709
We know who he is now.

673
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,004
All he wanted
was my nephew's property.

674
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:06,132
I don't want to take it,

675
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,802
I'm defending it!

676
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,138
He's not my nephew.

677
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,392
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it.

678
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,311
Cobbler, step forward.

679
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,983
Is it sure they'll let me go?

680
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,363
If I say what I have to say,
canlleave?

681
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,158
I guarantee you'll return
to your village.

682
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:38,623
Before he left, Martin Guerre

683
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,750
had a very large foot.

684
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,380
His size was 12 points.

685
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,010
After he came back...

686
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,348
his size was only 9 points.

687
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,519
You're quite sure?

688
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:02,188
Yes.

689
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:05,358
In my trade,
I've seen feet grow bigger,

690
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:09,237
but I've never known feet to shrink.

691
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,116
You're getting old!

692
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,161
Your sight's going...
You forget things.

693
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,955
I see better than you, you old mule!

694
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,249
You see where your interest lies!

695
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,211
Jacmette, your fingers remember.

696
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,810
Tell them who I am.

697
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:43,438
Tell the truth.

698
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,829
You're Martin Guerre.

699
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,418
Bertrande, my wife,

700
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,504
you know me better than anyone.

701
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,341
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield.

702
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,386
Swear it on the Holy Gospel.

703
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:18,097
You won't swear it?

704
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:22,143
Therefore I am your husband?

705
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,438
You are my husband.

706
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,696
Step forward, Bertrande.

707
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,628
And this cross?

708
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,548
I didn't draw it.

709
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,387
Then why didn't you protest?

710
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,347
They threatened me.

711
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:00,640
Who?

712
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:01,975
To throw me out.

713
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,977
She's lying!

714
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,771
- That cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!

715
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,315
They'll do anything!
They tried to kill me!

716
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,317
It's her mark.

717
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,528
I saw her sign it.

718
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,405
I didn't sign!

719
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,367
I would have signed my name.

720
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,330
How? You can't write.

721
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,584
I'd like a quill and some paper.

722
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,418
Pierre, how long are we staying here?

723
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,128
I don't know...

724
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,547
As long as it takes.

725
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,890
Who pays for it?

726
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,391
<i>I'll pay You-</i>

727
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,603
Enough to live on. That's the law.

728
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,649
Who is Bertrande de Rois?

729
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:35,276
Why do you want her?

730
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,570
She is to be housed separately.

731
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,791
You see me, Blessed Virgin Mary.

732
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,086
You see the distress and sorrow I'm in.

733
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,257
I'm begging you, help me-

734
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,594
Protect me.

735
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:09,852
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?

736
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:12,605
Accused, sit down and stay seated!

737
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,273
Continue.

738
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,442
Continue.

739
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:18,778
Didn't he?

740
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:22,115
Money to pay for killing me!

741
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,120
Call Dominge Pailhas.

742
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,123
Is he here?

743
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,461
Come forward.

744
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,890
Don't be afraid.

745
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,810
Tell the truth.

746
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:53,896
Did Pierre offer you money?

747
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,482
Be honest. Yes or no?

748
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:01,154
Yes, he offered me money.

749
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,366
I said I wouldn't kill a relative,

750
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:06,993
even for money.

751
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,037
I'm sort of related to Martin.

752
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,832
It's true, that's what he said.

753
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:18,921
Thank you.

754
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,257
Go back to your seat.

755
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,176
Jeanne, come here.

756
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,055
Speak up now.

757
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:31,684
Didn't uncle
urge my wife to accuse me?

758
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,524
It's true.

759
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,112
Didn't he threaten to throw her out?

760
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,865
Yes, it's true.

761
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,535
Didn't he raise his hand to her?

762
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,414
It's a lie!

763
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,374
Silence!

764
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:02,840
Let me talk to her husband.

765
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,302
- Augustin, come here.
- The accused will remain seated!

766
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,306
Augustin, come here!

767
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:15,228
You lived under our roof.

768
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,606
After the soldier had been there,

769
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,150
you said: be careful.

770
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:25,321
My uncle was sending people after me
to beat me up.

771
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,323
Remember?

772
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,450
To teach me a lesson.

773
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,079
You must remember!

774
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:37,583
We'd beaten the Vals team 4-2,
a Sunday in August!

775
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:44,757
I remember.

776
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,635
It's true.

777
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,263
So, uncle,

778
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:53,015
you thought I'd never find out?

779
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,478
He's the impostor, the criminal!

780
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,939
He should be sitting here.

781
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,280
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...

782
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,241
who profaned God...

783
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,784
What do I care?

784
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,621
I'm not Arnaud of Tihl!

785
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,169
I'm not that man!

786
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:30,011
I'm not that man.

787
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,536
The man's memory is prodigious...

788
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:57,914
and he's very clever.

789
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,501
What if he were a demon?

790
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:08,090
It has happened before.

791
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:11,218
Demons like to enter human beings

792
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:13,346
and poison their minds.

793
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,683
What do you think?

794
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:24,941
Lies have a thousand faces...

795
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:27,360
even the Demon's.

796
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,696
Truth has only one.

797
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,366
And justice exists...

798
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,701
to discover the truth.

799
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,079
He knew everything.

800
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:41,374
Better than anyone in the village.

801
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:44,585
When he came back...

802
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:48,214
he knew my sons' names!

803
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,927
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move.

804
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,555
I felt that I was...

805
01:22:57,765 --> 01:22:58,891
on fire!

806
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,735
I'm sure he uses magic.

807
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,739
Even here, with all of us!

808
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,784
Since the world began,

809
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,286
Satan has had a store of magic.

810
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,748
How can he know so much?

811
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:25,584
And have all the answers?

812
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,255
He is the Devil's emissary.

813
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,757
Perhaps he is a devil himself.

814
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,176
I'm not a devil!

815
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,595
Silence! Sit down!

816
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,516
If a devil is in you,

817
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:41,809
speak.

818
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:43,936
Tell us his name.

819
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,649
A devil? Then I'd be with my wife!

820
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,943
I wouldn't have been arrested!

821
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,945
I wouldn't be here!

822
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:58,784
He answered well.

823
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,538
There is no proof of any magic.

824
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,624
What should we do?

825
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,044
AW Suggestions?

826
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:12,381
The most humane solution...

827
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:16,302
Presume innocence
if guilt is not proven.

828
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,347
But first...

829
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,976
I'd like another chance to question

830
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,354
Martin Guerre's wife.

831
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,248
The Court turns to you.

832
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,088
Now...

833
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,508
and for the last time...

834
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,010
lask you...

835
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,889
if that man is your husband.

836
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:04,892
Yes, I'm sure.

837
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,815
How can you be absolutely certain?

838
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:14,860
Speak. We are here to learn all.

839
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,037
On his return, he knew all about me.

840
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,711
Did he know intimate details,

841
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:34,922
only a husband could know?

842
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:45,724
What?

843
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,102
What details?

844
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,903
He knew when I wanted him...

845
01:25:58,946 --> 01:26:00,906
and the words to say...

846
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,491
before...

847
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,286
during... and after.

848
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,003
The Court...

849
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:18,507
will now retire to deliberate.

850
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,476
I think that does it.

851
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,441
This peasant seems
to have won his case.

852
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:36,942
He's Martin Guerre.

853
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,987
It would be inhuman not to free him.

854
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,989
We'll clear his name.

855
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,493
Could anyone else
have defended him better?

856
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,584
In the name of the King
and of his justice...

857
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,045
this Parliament...

858
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,380
Mr. President!

859
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,382
...hereby declares

860
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,677
that the accused is indeed...

861
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,598
is indeed Martin...

862
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,438
One moment, gentlemen.

863
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,610
A new witness insists on being heard.

864
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,531
Have him come forward.

865
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,416
You claim to be Martin Guerre?

866
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,085
Yes, that's my name.

867
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,339
Silence!

868
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,509
Stay where you are!

869
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,264
Where were you?

870
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:14,433
In Picardy. The Army.

871
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,771
I lost my leg at Saint-Quentin.

872
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:23,192
Back in Artigat,
I heard what was happening.

873
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:24,610
Here I am.

874
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,863
Do you know that man?

875
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,494
We soldiered together.

876
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:36,121
Do you know his name?

877
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:39,083
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette.

878
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,377
Don't listen! Look at them...

879
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:44,129
Having lost, they try a last ruse!

880
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:47,132
A beggar, hired by my uncle!

881
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,306
Do you know that woman?

882
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:04,858
Bertrande, my wife.

883
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:07,236
It's one last low trick!

884
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,196
Accused, stay in your seat!

885
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,826
You wrong me and you insult me?

886
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:16,161
Wrong you?

887
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,540
I've never laid eyes on you!

888
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,711
Why don't you arrest him?
He's a hired liar!

889
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:26,547
Silence, both of you.

890
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,007
Pierre Guerre, step forward.

891
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:30,592
You and your wife.

892
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,230
Do you know this man?

893
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:46,358
Yes...

894
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,528
Yes, I recognize him.

895
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,573
Martin, my nephew.

896
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:57,035
Let me embrace you, Martin.

897
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,457
At last you're back.

898
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,251
You're quite sure?

899
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:07,379
He's my brother's son.

900
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:09,548
And you?

901
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:14,219
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God.

902
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,263
Arrest him!

903
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:18,265
Stay seated!

904
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:23,103
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...

905
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,606
just in time, like a miracle!

906
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:26,773
It's God's doing.

907
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:31,278
The hand of God, manifesting itself!

908
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,946
It's divine justice.

909
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,948
God has sent him

910
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,450
to prevent injustice!

911
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,499
To your seats!
Return to your seats!

912
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,428
Don't forsake me!

913
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:01,016
It's a plot against me.

914
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,019
In my own family!

915
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,146
You sir, above all.

916
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:10,192
Please listen to me once more

917
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:11,652
or else I'm lost.

918
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:15,113
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat.

919
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:17,407
He's a paid liar.

920
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:21,828
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him.

921
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,707
Let me put him to the test!

922
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:33,173
Do it.

923
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,515
You claim to be me. Tell me...

924
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,351
On my wedding night

925
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,063
who gave us the nuptial bowl?

926
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:56,321
She did.

927
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:59,366
Catherine. She tucked us in.

928
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:04,496
I was bewitched.
How many masses were said for me?

929
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:11,336
It's so long ago and I'm tired.

930
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:18,343
Answer!

931
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:22,389
- Six...
- He's wrong!

932
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,224
He doesn't know!

933
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:25,851
Not six... four!

934
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,353
Answer, you know.

935
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:30,522
Tell the truth before God.

936
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,567
I said four masses, it's true.

937
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:43,744
You should have been better informed.

938
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,414
Where was the spell broken?

939
01:33:47,706 --> 01:33:49,207
At the priest's.

940
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,419
Was it hot or cold?

941
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:53,920
Cold... I was naked.

942
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:57,633
That's true! I was naked.

943
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,260
We warmed up quickly!

944
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:09,394
Who bought the sacks of grain I stole?

945
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:12,814
Smallpox André.

946
01:34:13,482 --> 01:34:15,567
You learned that lesson well...

947
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:21,406
Another thing...

948
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:25,994
When I went away, what did I leave
in the linen-chest upstairs?

949
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:29,623
What did I leave?

950
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:32,000
I left it! What was it?

951
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,509
White breeches!

952
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:42,552
Sewn by Bertrande.

953
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:43,970
And you didn't know.

954
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,682
- I told you about them!
- I told you!

955
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:48,684
Don't twist it around!

956
01:34:48,809 --> 01:34:50,143
Arrest him!

957
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,479
I've proven I'm Martin Guerre!

958
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,481
One moment.

959
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,317
You say you told him?

960
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:59,653
And he's trying to use it!

961
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,780
But before you said...

962
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,324
you didn't know him.

963
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:15,961
Accused, sit down.

964
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,300
The sisters, come here.

965
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:35,731
Which one is your brother?

966
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,151
Make up your minds.

967
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,996
This is my brother.

968
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:55,542
It's Martin Guerre.

969
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,044
No, you're making a mistake!

970
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,671
And you, Guillemette?

971
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,508
What do you say?

972
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,511
I can't remember.

973
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:08,555
I was too little.

974
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:11,683
Maybe it's him.

975
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,393
He's my father!

976
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:17,689
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!

977
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,191
Silence!

978
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:21,526
I order you to be quiet!

979
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:26,782
Catherine Boére, come here.

980
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:31,745
What do you say?

981
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:33,246
Me?

982
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,956
Yes, you. What do you say?

983
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,541
Of no importance...

984
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,627
I'm not family.

985
01:36:38,752 --> 01:36:41,421
Catherine... Tell them.

986
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,087
Forgive me, Martin.

987
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:26,591
Don't cry...
Women cry easily.

988
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,595
You should have known
your own husband.

989
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,641
Our house is dishonored.

990
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:37,269
It's all your fault.

991
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:43,608
You're to blame, Martin.

992
01:37:48,697 --> 01:37:50,991
You betrayed my friendship.

993
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:54,160
You deserve no pity.

994
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:04,963
What harm in caring for a woman
her husband deserted?

995
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:11,636
We await your confession...

996
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,306
Arnaud of Tihl.

997
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:23,899
It's true.

998
01:38:26,693 --> 01:38:28,486
We soldiered together.

999
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:34,659
He talked about his wife...

1000
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,912
his son, his house...

1001
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:41,541
One day on the road,
two men took me for him

1002
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,710
They called me Martin.

1003
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,921
It gave me an idea.

1004
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:47,923
I thought...

1005
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:54,220
Why not take his place?

1006
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:02,729
So I learned all I could.

1007
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:05,690
Martin said he wasn't coming back.

1008
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,861
I went to Artigat,

1009
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:11,738
I was taken for him.

1010
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,244
I almost told them:

1011
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:21,706
"I fooled you! Martin's up north!"

1012
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,750
I almost said it.

1013
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:29,714
Then I saw you.

1014
01:39:34,094 --> 01:39:35,720
I took you in my arms.

1015
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:41,393
Next day, it was too late.

1016
01:39:44,813 --> 01:39:48,066
After that,
I learned whatever I didn't know

1017
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:51,403
from my uncle, sisters, wife.

1018
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,906
And I remembered it.

1019
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:08,795
There's no magic in it.

1020
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:12,090
I swear it.

1021
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:23,935
You don't deserve her.

1022
01:40:24,978 --> 01:40:26,980
I know her better than you do.

1023
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,992
I ask you all to forgive me.

1024
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:40,994
You.

1025
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:43,621
Them.

1026
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:47,959
And you...

1027
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,171
who were my wife.

1028
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:12,484
Your men can stay in the barn.

1029
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:17,072
Pierre Guerre,
you brought discord to this village.

1030
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,574
Now keep the peace.

1031
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,048
Leave us, please.

1032
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:07,872
I'm thirsty.

1033
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:26,641
You have dared much
and feared God very little.

1034
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:33,731
We hesitated
before declaring you innocent.

1035
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:40,780
It was unwise
to take that stranger into your bed.

1036
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:45,493
Women are often the victims

1037
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,245
of men's wickedness.

1038
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,254
That's why we acquitted you.

1039
01:42:58,173 --> 01:42:59,966
And legitimated...

1040
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:02,677
your daughter's birth.

1041
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:04,971
We hope that now...

1042
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:08,808
you will be a good wife.

1043
01:43:11,603 --> 01:43:14,355
But tell me, between us...

1044
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,441
so I'll understand...

1045
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:24,657
Before Arnaud appeared,

1046
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,701
you needed a man?

1047
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:32,832
And this one pleased you?

1048
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:40,048
Did he satisfy your need?

1049
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:46,638
You loved each other?

1050
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:54,145
You knew from the start?

1051
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:56,648
You can tell me.

1052
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:58,983
It will go no farther.

1053
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,574
Arnaud and I...

1054
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,537
were good together.

1055
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:17,001
Martin had neglected me.

1056
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:20,838
Arnaud respected me...

1057
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,841
like a true husband.

1058
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,887
I trusted him completely.

1059
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:35,561
We thought of asking to be judged.

1060
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,107
We could have won.

1061
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:48,616
If Martin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife.

1062
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:52,078
No one could've denied it.

1063
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:55,248
At the last minute...

1064
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,625
Why did you change?

1065
01:45:00,128 --> 01:45:01,796
Why choose Martin?

1066
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:10,805
In Arnaud's eyes...

1067
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:16,936
I saw it was hopeless.

1068
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:23,568
I saw what he wanted.

1069
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:34,912
He wanted me to live...

1070
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:38,082
for me and my children.

1071
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:42,754
So I did it.

1072
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:09,113
God forgive me, I defiled marriage.

1073
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:12,116
The King, the law,

1074
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,619
all those I offended...

1075
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,122
forgive me.

1076
01:46:21,959 --> 01:46:23,795
Stand up, Arnaud.

1077
01:46:42,522 --> 01:46:43,731
Guards!

1078
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,525
Open the door.

1079
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:13,386
God forgive me,

1080
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:16,222
I defiled marriage.

1081
01:47:16,848 --> 01:47:20,184
The King, the law...

1082
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:23,729
all those I offended, forgive me.

1083
01:48:34,467 --> 01:48:36,469
Commend your soul to God.

1084
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:58,533
The story of the false Martin Guerre

1085
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:00,701
ended that morning.

1086
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:06,165
The Councillor, Jean of Coras,
impressed

1087
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:10,461
by this daring imposture,
made a record of it.

1088
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:12,964
12 years later...

1089
01:49:13,798 --> 01:49:16,050
came the St Bartholomew Massacre.

1090
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:19,178
For his Protestant beliefs,

1091
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:23,516
Jean de Coras was hanged
before the Toulouse Parliament

1092
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:25,977
with a hundred of his friends.

1093
01:49:28,354 --> 01:49:31,148
But we live only by the spirit.

1094
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:34,068
All else dies.
