00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:23,509
THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE

2
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:45,955
On this St. Michael's Sunday
in the church of Artigat...

3
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,658
...we receive
Bertrande de Rols...

4
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:52,937
...daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols and of...

5
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:55,040
...Raimonde, his wife

6
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,908
And we receive Martin Guerre...

7
00:01:57,644 --> 00:02:00,340
...son of Mathurin Guerre...

8
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,639
and of his wife, Brigitte,

9
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,249
Martin wishes to take Bertrande
for wife...

10
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,749
and keep her all his life

11
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,504
I, Martin, give my body to thee,
Bertrande

12
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:36,209
I accept it and give my body
to thee, Martin

13
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:44,384
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony

14
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:51,925
You will not regret
having followed this story...

15
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:56,131
...for it is not a tale
of adventure...

16
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,236
...nor an imaginary fable

17
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:02,339
It is a true story

18
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:09,278
It began one August Sunday,
in 1542...

19
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,013
...in the village of Artigat,
county of Foix...

20
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,279
...in the reign of Francis I

21
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,552
Bertrande, at her parents'
decision...

22
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,098
...brings a dowry of 30 acres
of wheat...

23
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:31,629
...and 40 of millet, at the place
called Pomarede

24
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,698
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods...

25
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:41,775
...inherited from her father
Laurent, deceased

26
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:50,585
Three dresses, one bed,
one linen-chest with lock and key

27
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,352
That's all

28
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,324
Catherine... something to drink

29
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,599
If you still agree, sign here

30
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:18,143
Seraphin, you will have
to blow harder, boy!

31
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,394
It's a good match... well
arranged

32
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,365
May the Lord bless
this bed with health...

33
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,413
...and keep the Demon
from this house

34
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:52,716
Kiss her, Father

35
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:02,552
Martin, tender buds need
to be sprinkled at night!

36
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,957
You two... kiss your brother

37
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:13,472
Make us some pretty
grandchildren!

38
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:25,446
The rest... you can do without me

39
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,820
Whenever you want,
come eat and dance.

40
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,764
This is Bertrande de Rols

41
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,543
You say at first
your husband couldn't...

42
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:10,349
...consummate your marriage.
Why not?

43
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:14,716
Because of the spell
that had been cast on him

44
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:20,093
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?

45
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,197
Yes... but I didn't

46
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:31,166
I was married...
I felt bound to him

47
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:33,878
People knew?

48
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,777
Of course... We had no children

49
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,942
They made fun of him?

50
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:42,281
Yes... the whole village

51
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:48,349
Tell me what happened that
Candlemas Day

52
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:05,231
If you're tired of sleeping
at night, change husbands!

53
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:14,038
Change husbands
if you want to have children!

54
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:49,073
Stop trembling, boy

55
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,083
It's caused by evil thoughts

56
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:57,422
They put a spell on you

57
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,225
I'll take it away

58
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,407
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you

59
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:25,446
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you

60
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,651
Blessed Flesh,
I make you grow again

61
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:37,229
Accursed Demon, leave
this servant of the Lord

62
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:41,224
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin...

63
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,334
...whose flesh is suffering

64
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:52,734
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Bertrande...

65
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,210
...whose flesh is suffering

66
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,778
And put in all your heart.

67
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,720
Don't be afraid

68
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:17,493
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament

69
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:21,365
I am now in charge
of this matter

70
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:32,316
You must tell me everything,
even if the priest said not to

71
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,654
And that worked?

72
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,924
That very day... yes

73
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,325
We had a son... his name is Sanxi

74
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,394
So all was well

75
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,140
For me, yes, but Martin...

76
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:01,446
Martin kept to himself

77
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,706
He didn't even look at our son

78
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,249
He didn't like farming

79
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:12,547
He and his father argued

80
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,700
You want us to die of thirst?

81
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:17,012
Where were you?

82
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,653
You can't do anything right!

83
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:23,190
Iwas with some soldiers,
at the stream

84
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,105
2 sacks of grain are gone...
You seen them?

85
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:45,848
You stole them

86
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:49,613
You loaded the grain...
You stole them!

87
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,917
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!

88
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:55,716
I’ll make you hate the
taste of bread!

89
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,526
Ididn't take them!
- While I'm alive...

90
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:01,293
...I'm the master here!

91
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:20,311
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?

92
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,856
Wear them Sunday

93
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:32,488
You cut them too big.
You wasted your time

94
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:34,929
You always scold me

95
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:44,770
It's not my fault

96
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:48,043
Be nice sometimes

97
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,724
That was the night he left

98
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,926
Why steal the grain?

99
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,033
Did he know he was leaving?

100
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:16,768
And needed money?

101
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,273
Maybe... I don't know

102
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:21,079
He didn't talk to me much

103
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,752
What did you think?

104
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:32,652
That he'd be back soon

105
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:36,226
Everyone thought so

106
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:40,095
That his father had scared him

107
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,334
He waited for Martin
every day for months

108
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,733
Finally he died...
killed by sorrow

109
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:51,602
Martin's mother died
a year later

110
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:57,145
So Melusine married a prince...

111
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,051
...and all her sons
became kings

112
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:06,754
But one Saturday,
her husband couldn't resist

113
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,959
He peeked through the keyhole...

114
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,900
...and saw she was a mermaid...

115
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:20,537
...with scales on her body,
and wings on her back

116
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:35,212
Some people believe
she comes back every day...

117
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:37,753
...secretly, to feed the children

118
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,355
And I believe it, too

119
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,259
She couldn't desert them

120
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,331
Your mother got married again?

121
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,178
Yes... to Pierre Guerre,
my husband's uncle

122
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,549
To keep the farms together?

123
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:07,780
No doubt

124
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,081
Our lands are now held in common

125
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,835
The wolves are out tonight

126
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,869
Make sure the animals
are locked up

127
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:34,706
Yes, mother...
I do it every night

128
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:49,885
Dirty beast!

129
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:54,052
Did Martin stay away long?

130
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,786
Eight winters... or nine

131
00:18:57,696 --> 00:19:00,563
You never heard from him?

132
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,760
No... nothing

133
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:07,836
But I'm sure you had
no lack of admirers

134
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,900
No... but I kept my virtue

135
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:13,067
Speak up, we can't hear you

136
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,673
I kept my virtue

137
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,906
Ask anyone... I remained chaste

138
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,980
You never forgot Martin?

139
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:29,417
Iprayed to St. Catherine
to send him back

140
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,090
So many seasons passed...

141
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,737
Then she heard me.

142
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:21,670
Who are you?

143
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,777
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?

144
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,108
Who are you?

145
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:32,318
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely!

146
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,461
Do I know you?
- I think you do

147
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,199
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?

148
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:55,209
Is it you, Martin?

149
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:01,949
You're back!

150
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:08,521
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son

151
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:11,424
No, Jacques is my brother

152
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:16,523
Right... you're "Smallpox Andre"

153
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:32,212
Remember the bear hunt,
when Nicolas "castrated" me?

154
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:35,480
Made me miserable, didn't you?

155
00:21:38,223 --> 00:21:39,781
Martin Guerre is back!

156
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,592
You're bigger, Martin

157
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,854
War does that

158
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:52,932
Martin Guerre is back!

159
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,596
You've seen him?

160
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,469
Yes! He's down the road

161
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,219
Guillemette... your brother!

162
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:17,759
Are you sure?
- I saw him!

163
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,934
Bertrande, your husband's back!

164
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:27,472
Come... it's your husband!

165
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:59,229
You still here?

166
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:06,476
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!

167
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,831
Hello Jeanne... sister

168
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,663
Martin... at last!

169
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,033
You've changed!

170
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:41,673
Where's your husband?

171
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:52,215
Are you Guillemette?

172
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:59,796
You were so small when I left!

173
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,062
Come kiss your brother

174
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,973
Sanxi?

175
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:21,080
You're so big

176
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:24,588
Don't be afraid

177
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:27,920
Come nearer

178
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,418
I'm your father

179
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,273
Hello, Uncle

180
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,286
You were gone a long time

181
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,487
That's true

182
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,225
Forgive me for what I did

183
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:13,130
Your father and mother are dead

184
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:17,708
I heard, and I prayed for them

185
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,912
I also heard you
married Raimonde...

186
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:26,280
...my wife's mother

187
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:29,548
It's good news

188
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,916
My daughter has suffered

189
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:38,423
Have you changed for the better?

190
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,040
You're here... it's all true!

191
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,339
Is it really you?

192
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:05,522
Is that you, Catherine?

193
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,492
You haven't changed

194
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,935
I wondered if you'd ever
come back

195
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,735
And here you are, safe and sound

196
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:46,224
Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house

197
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,831
She's waiting for you

198
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:30,473
It's me, hello

199
00:27:52,564 --> 00:27:54,964
It's me... Martin

200
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:16,618
Hello, Martin

201
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,938
My God, my wife is beautiful!

202
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:19,443
It is a gift of God
that you have returned

203
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:32,559
He was in the Army in Picardy

204
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:42,801
Don't you recognize me?

205
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,407
Who are you?

206
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:48,203
It's me... Nicolas

207
00:29:58,823 --> 00:30:02,554
It's confusing, seeing you all

208
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:13,068
I forgot about the bear long ago

209
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:15,301
I've seen worse

210
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,641
Here's cloth from Flanders

211
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,510
The nicest for Bertrande,
with lace

212
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:13,155
Catherine, take the last one

213
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,381
You've learned to read?

214
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:43,185
And to write, too

215
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:45,790
To write?

216
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:00,775
What did you do all this time?

217
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:08,781
Ifought in the war

218
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:12,585
I even went to Spain

219
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:21,897
Then I wanted to see you

220
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:31,768
All of you

221
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:33,705
What's Spain like?

222
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:35,577
It's dry

223
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,913
And Paris? Did you see Paris?

224
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:45,815
It's big...
There are people everywhere

225
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,317
I even got lost there

226
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:02,399
There are thieves at night

227
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:06,935
You're so strong now, Martin!

228
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,972
Iknew my brother would come back

229
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,415
This calls for a celebration!

230
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:20,119
When you left here, Martin...

231
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,219
...you didn't have a beard yet

232
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,896
And you didn't drink as much

233
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,428
Now I drink like a monk!

234
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,596
After war... peace!

235
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,169
To you, my wife

236
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,379
A little rough... but not bad

237
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,315
Just enough to kill the worms!

238
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:14,301
I’ll prepare your bed

239
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,981
It's good to be on your own land

240
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:31,652
What are you looking for?

241
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:33,923
The candles

242
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:35,463
In there

243
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:37,965
You moved them?

244
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,236
No, they've always been there

245
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:45,768
Then I forgot

246
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:15,405
She cried a lot because of you

247
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,383
Remember, Bertrande?

248
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,615
Go get my white breeches...

249
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,719
...the ones lined with silk...

250
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:36,923
...from the linen-chest

251
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:41,564
If they're still there

252
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:49,605
I'll go

253
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:55,841
You've found your smile

254
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:17,156
"The bird's back in the nest,
Tonight they will not rest"

255
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:42,053
They're still there

256
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,524
Waiting for you... like me

257
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:03,541
I'll wear them tomorrow

258
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,151
How often I've wanted you

259
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:02,363
I'm here only because of you

260
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:37,470
So everyone recognized him?

261
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:39,566
Yes... everyone

262
00:38:40,077 --> 00:38:43,308
His sisters, his uncle...

263
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:46,213
...Catherine, the servant?

264
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,111
His friends... the whole village

265
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,055
You too?

266
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,690
Me too

267
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:57,756
Without hesitation?

268
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:06,062
Then what?

269
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:10,072
He took up his work,
his place at home

270
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,840
We had two children.
The first died...

271
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,407
...the second is alive:
A girl, 18 months old

272
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:24,315
And everything went well?

273
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,978
Very well

274
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,014
Better than before?

275
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,323
Yes... and he worked hard

276
00:39:33,597 --> 00:39:35,861
Our harvests have never
been better

277
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,792
And between you two?

278
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:41,765
It's been good

279
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,940
When did the doubts first begin?

280
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:52,282
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn

281
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:21,469
A game for 15 points?

282
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:25,275
Idon't gamble

283
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,686
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy relic?

284
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:33,790
Go to the devil,
we have a priest!

285
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:39,387
I’m going back

286
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:46,232
I'll play

287
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,172
Dominique, play with me

288
00:40:49,774 --> 00:40:52,072
No, I think not... like Martin

289
00:40:52,777 --> 00:40:55,769
Come on Father... only 15 points

290
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,748
Who is he?

291
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:11,623
Martin Guerre, who went away
and came back

292
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:14,393
Like the prodigal son

293
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,494
He's not Martin Guerre!

294
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,128
Iknew Martin Guerre

295
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:24,034
At the battle of St. Quentin

296
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:28,167
In fact, he lost a leg there

297
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:31,439
Of course it's Martin

298
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,947
I ought to know...
I'm the one who married him

299
00:41:34,151 --> 00:41:38,520
But it's not! He's...

300
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:42,623
What's his name again?

301
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:48,823
Iknew him in the Army, too.

302
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,134
It is Martin...
we're even related!

303
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:56,865
Itell you he's not Martin

304
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,002
He's Pansette!

305
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:02,805
That's it... Pansette

306
00:42:06,584 --> 00:42:09,451
He's from the village of Tihl

307
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:12,147
I knew him in Picardy, too

308
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:17,318
What's he doing here?

309
00:42:17,695 --> 00:42:20,061
Isaw two of those people
in Arras

310
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,863
From a land called Brazil

311
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,737
Their bodies were all painted

312
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:38,237
They had feathers on their
heads... It's true, Sanxi

313
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:45,717
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us

314
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:55,153
They were in chains,
and made to dance

315
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:05,373
In their own country,
they go naked

316
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:08,634
Even the women?

317
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,311
Sounds like a nice country

318
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,009
Then you should go there

319
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:24,319
They eat their prisoner's hearts

320
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:29,562
And the prisoners consider it
a worthy death

321
00:43:33,938 --> 00:43:37,032
Are they human?
Do they have a soul?

322
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:39,973
The monks say they do

323
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:49,383
In some tribes, they share
their land and their women

324
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:54,748
In others, the women go to war
and make all the decisions

325
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:05,098
The day women rule here,
it'll be the end of the world

326
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:24,186
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind

327
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:00,383
No... Let's go home, I'm afraid

328
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,154
Why?

329
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,634
See? A circle of smoke...

330
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:16,635
Spirits will be out...
We mustn't look at them

331
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:36,522
Pansette! What are you doing?

332
00:45:37,728 --> 00:45:39,559
Leaving us already?

333
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,626
Trying to find your way?

334
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:48,598
When are you going?

335
00:45:50,774 --> 00:45:52,435
Did you come to
the wrong village?

336
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:06,646
Imight've known it was you,
you snake!

337
00:46:11,361 --> 00:46:15,525
He's strong! Not like Martin...
right, Bertrande?

338
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,901
Pansette, you look true
but you play false

339
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:22,803
Beware!

340
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,545
Where was this soldier from?

341
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:37,347
A garrison in Picardy

342
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:47,155
Don't believe tales told
by strangers...

343
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:50,055
...and by drunks

344
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:53,069
Or by rogues!

345
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,506
He's right

346
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:04,609
"Lies come easy from afar"

347
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:11,187
We know Martin well

348
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,612
If anyone knows Martin...

349
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:41,650
...it's us

350
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,806
We must do our accounts one day

351
00:48:47,985 --> 00:48:49,816
How much my land earned
in my absence

352
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:53,612
What do you mean?

353
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:59,328
You worked my land and I'm
grateful... but it made a profit

354
00:48:59,863 --> 00:49:01,296
Now I need the money

355
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:05,357
I figure it's about 6000 livres

356
00:49:09,273 --> 00:49:12,538
You dare ask me
for an accounting?

357
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:18,904
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?

358
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:22,011
I, who protected your wife?

359
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:26,611
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?

360
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,092
It was your duty! Iwent
to war... I've a right to it!

361
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,126
You have no rights... you left!

362
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:36,198
Yes, I have!
Ihave the law on my side

363
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:39,802
I'll seek justice, if I must

364
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,570
You'll be condemned

365
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:45,602
You threaten your uncle?

366
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,672
Ineed that money!

367
00:49:56,453 --> 00:49:58,944
I’ll sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pusol's...

368
00:50:00,857 --> 00:50:02,381
...to plant barley

369
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:08,696
You want to sell
your father's field?

370
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:10,765
It's too steep for planting

371
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:16,202
You're starting to squander
our property!

372
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:19,302
But I expected it

373
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:21,842
I'm not surprised

374
00:50:23,213 --> 00:50:24,840
I warn you...

375
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:28,513
...Martin or not Martin

376
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,586
...you won't get away with it!

377
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:32,949
What did you say?

378
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,749
Repeat that!

379
00:50:59,883 --> 00:51:04,343
So Bertrande, you have
doubts too?

380
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,983
Know what they're saying?

381
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:14,330
You know that if this man
isn't your husband...

382
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:20,727
...you've been living in
mortal sin for three years

383
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:25,675
You know that
you're damning your soul

384
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:30,938
You'll follow him into
the depths of Hell

385
00:51:32,649 --> 00:51:34,378
Your flesh will burn

386
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:38,548
Your eyes will fall
into the flames

387
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:44,290
You will scream but
no one will hear

388
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:51,826
An eternity of suffering
awaits you, Bertrande

389
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:54,633
Aren't you afraid to lie to God?

390
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:59,408
If you have doubts, why haven't
you told me, in confession?

391
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,272
You aren't hiding anything
from me?

392
00:52:04,114 --> 00:52:05,809
Beware, Bertrande...

393
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,885
...of the day when the dead
come for the living...

394
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:12,412
...the Day of Judgment!

395
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:20,019
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too

396
00:52:20,897 --> 00:52:22,387
The whole village did

397
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,594
You all welcomed him

398
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:28,994
Look at Bertrande

399
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:32,399
She's not complaining

400
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:34,203
She's never looked better

401
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:38,845
He'd been gone a long time

402
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,214
What if we were all mistaken?

403
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:51,117
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?

404
00:52:51,962 --> 00:52:55,329
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief

405
00:52:56,867 --> 00:52:58,858
You're right to stand up to him

406
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,432
I ask you again...

407
00:53:06,243 --> 00:53:08,143
...what if it's not him?

408
00:53:12,883 --> 00:53:14,612
You be careful, too.

409
00:53:18,588 --> 00:53:20,522
After me, it'll be your turn

410
00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:26,352
He'll wipe your ass
and take your shirt!

411
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,057
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again

412
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:36,695
Leaving you your eyes to cry with

413
00:53:37,474 --> 00:53:40,068
Then you'll see what kind
of man he is!

414
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:56,016
The work isn't finished!

415
00:53:59,396 --> 00:54:01,296
I’m ashamed for you, Uncle

416
00:54:31,995 --> 00:54:33,462
My father wants you

417
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:35,958
I'm coming

418
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:54,274
What do you want?

419
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,783
I’ve thought it over

420
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:01,584
You're right... I have the money

421
00:55:02,158 --> 00:55:05,184
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you

422
00:55:06,663 --> 00:55:08,324
I don't want any trouble

423
00:55:15,305 --> 00:55:17,603
Know where your father hid money?

424
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:24,112
No, he never told me

425
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:29,111
In the hay-loft above the stable

426
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:42,059
I'll wait for you there
at cock's crow

427
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:44,390
I'll give you your due

428
00:55:51,972 --> 00:55:56,170
But let's keep it to ourselves

429
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:27,570
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales

430
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,539
They're all jealous

431
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:35,511
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar

432
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,242
All they talk about is us

433
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:43,250
Calm down, my uncle has
understood... He'll shut them up

434
00:56:44,925 --> 00:56:45,983
Give me your hand

435
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:00,338
Let me guide you

436
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:16,485
Is that her name?

437
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:21,059
Yes, that's my name

438
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:49,520
It's in the grain chest

439
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,270
You wanted it, right?

440
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,139
You wanted what we owe you?

441
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:11,602
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...

442
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:13,873
...in hard cash!

443
00:58:18,986 --> 00:58:20,851
You won't ask for it again!

444
00:58:23,824 --> 00:58:26,019
At your service, Pansette!

445
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:29,623
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!

446
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:37,134
Go on, Antoine,
or I'll disinherit you!

447
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,654
You were ready to die for him?

448
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:58,748
Yes, to protect him

449
00:59:01,462 --> 00:59:03,123
Explain something to me

450
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:08,867
You defended your husband,
risking your own life

451
00:59:09,736 --> 00:59:12,500
But when his uncle
attacked him legally...

452
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,933
...you didn't say anything

453
00:59:15,776 --> 00:59:17,175
You should've protested

454
00:59:19,313 --> 00:59:21,008
Talked to the judge

455
00:59:21,548 --> 00:59:24,016
Told everyone:
I know he's my husband

456
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:27,913
But you said nothing

457
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:32,853
Why?

458
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,562
Did you have doubts, too?

459
00:59:42,135 --> 00:59:46,037
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?

460
00:59:49,643 --> 00:59:51,873
At one moment, I was troubled

461
00:59:53,547 --> 00:59:55,412
I wavered

462
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:58,077
I thought...

463
00:59:58,252 --> 00:59:59,549
Speak up

464
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,584
I thought: Maybe
he's fooling me, too

465
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,461
Charming me, as he did others

466
01:00:10,564 --> 01:00:12,964
Then my daughter is a bastard

467
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:18,537
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell

468
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:23,437
Yes... I had doubts

469
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:26,437
And still have?

470
01:00:28,682 --> 01:00:30,616
No, not any more

471
01:00:30,884 --> 01:00:32,442
Then he is your husband

472
01:00:33,754 --> 01:00:35,346
Yes or no?

473
01:00:35,722 --> 01:00:39,214
I say yes

474
01:00:46,867 --> 01:00:48,630
And what does he say?

475
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:50,736
The same thing, obviously

476
01:00:50,904 --> 01:00:52,667
He says they're man and wife

477
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:56,769
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament

478
01:00:57,411 --> 01:00:59,641
They're all here

479
01:01:01,114 --> 01:01:02,445
Come with us

480
01:01:22,135 --> 01:01:23,625
Go join your family

481
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:29,273
You are Martin Guerre?

482
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:31,974
Yes, I am

483
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:35,104
You're quite sure?

484
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:37,984
I don't know of any other

485
01:01:57,537 --> 01:01:59,437
You're going to pay!

486
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:01,972
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!

487
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:04,542
The law will punish you,
you cheat!

488
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:07,509
You tricked us,
to steal our property

489
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:10,548
Slander! To avoid paying
what you owe me!

490
01:02:10,717 --> 01:02:14,084
I owe you nothing!
You're not my nephew!

491
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:18,115
I am and you know it!
Everyone knows it!

492
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:20,485
Eat your words!

493
01:02:25,265 --> 01:02:28,257
The family apart... over here

494
01:02:42,282 --> 01:02:44,250
Now listen to me, all of you

495
01:02:46,486 --> 01:02:48,784
Those who honestly think...

496
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,253
...this man is not Martin Guerre,
to my left

497
01:03:16,717 --> 01:03:19,185
Those who honestly think...

498
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:26,686
...he truly is Martin Guerre,
to my right

499
01:03:51,785 --> 01:03:53,047
And you?

500
01:03:57,758 --> 01:03:59,851
I am their priest

501
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:04,293
But surely you have an opinion

502
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,664
The others have no opinion?

503
01:04:48,975 --> 01:04:51,842
In settlement of this dispute...

504
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:55,843
...I, Jean de Coras, Counselor
of the Toulouse Parliament...

505
01:04:56,349 --> 01:04:59,477
...declare that there is
no reason...

506
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:01,848
...to believe this man
is not Martin Guerre

507
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:06,589
The charge is dismissed
due to lack of proof

508
01:05:07,093 --> 01:05:10,324
This man shall be released

509
01:05:11,698 --> 01:05:14,326
Pierre Guerre is condemned
to pay...

510
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:19,268
...500 livres to the King
and to his nephew, for calumny

511
01:05:33,486 --> 01:05:34,919
Free him

512
01:05:45,932 --> 01:05:50,266
You are a knave! God knows it
and will punish you!

513
01:05:50,437 --> 01:05:53,702
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other

514
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:01,172
That was an excellent judgment

515
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,451
What happened to my brother?

516
01:07:47,053 --> 01:07:49,613
You should be in bed

517
01:08:16,549 --> 01:08:19,347
On your feet!
This time we've got you

518
01:08:19,519 --> 01:08:21,043
Get dressed

519
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:24,316
Get up, you're under arrest!

520
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:26,288
I was released yesterday!

521
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:29,428
Things changed during the night

522
01:08:30,797 --> 01:08:37,464
This time your wife signed, too

523
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:51,845
Get dressed, you're going
to Toulouse

524
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:55,777
When did she sign?

525
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:59,623
Last night, before going to bed

526
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:04,656
Is it true?

527
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:07,495
They made you sign?

528
01:09:12,072 --> 01:09:16,236
This time you're done for

529
01:09:55,381 --> 01:09:57,349
The accusation is the same

530
01:09:58,351 --> 01:10:02,151
But it will be more difficult
to answer

531
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:04,687
Your wife signed

532
01:10:04,858 --> 01:10:06,155
It's a forgery

533
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:10,318
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?

534
01:10:10,797 --> 01:10:12,822
Her uncle and cousins scare her

535
01:10:14,367 --> 01:10:15,959
They might cut her throat

536
01:10:17,737 --> 01:10:19,329
They've threatened her?

537
01:10:21,908 --> 01:10:23,136
Often

538
01:10:25,545 --> 01:10:27,308
Especially lately

539
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:33,174
She now says you betrayed her

540
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:36,755
That you're not her husband...
That's serious

541
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,850
I know her...
They forced her to sign.

542
01:10:43,096 --> 01:10:46,657
Assure her safety
and ask me what you want

543
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:48,800
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre

544
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:54,204
We've heard many witnesses...

545
01:10:56,776 --> 01:10:58,767
...and we shall hear more

546
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:05,314
Shall a counselor defend you?

547
01:11:05,485 --> 01:11:10,354
I don't need help to prove
who I am

548
01:11:11,758 --> 01:11:13,157
Who married you?

549
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:18,362
Father Dominique Caylar...
he's still there

550
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:21,065
He doesn't like me...
I swear a lot

551
01:11:22,802 --> 01:11:26,135
We married on St. Michael's day,
18 years ago

552
01:11:26,472 --> 01:11:27,962
Who was the notary?

553
01:11:31,377 --> 01:11:34,369
Jehan Pegala, from Fosset

554
01:11:38,818 --> 01:11:41,548
He was late, my father was upset

555
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:46,891
Bertrande's dowry was the
Roussas woods...

556
01:11:48,561 --> 01:11:51,359
...her lands at Pomarede
and two oxen...

557
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:55,199
...a bed with feather pillows...

558
01:11:57,203 --> 01:11:58,329
...and three dresses

559
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:02,564
And sacks of grain,
have you forgotten?

560
01:12:08,014 --> 01:12:12,110
No... no sacks of grain

561
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:24,994
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband

562
01:12:26,232 --> 01:12:28,496
That wasn't so before

563
01:12:30,436 --> 01:12:33,405
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left

564
01:12:33,873 --> 01:12:35,568
And she's changed

565
01:12:38,077 --> 01:12:39,601
So have I

566
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:46,418
You're not stupid

567
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:58,663
You know you risk death?

568
01:12:59,332 --> 01:13:01,800
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!

569
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:05,433
I was his nephew until
I wanted my money

570
01:13:05,605 --> 01:13:07,732
Everyone knew me: My sisters,
my wife's mother...

571
01:13:07,907 --> 01:13:10,740
...even my wife

572
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,242
Others also say you're not Martin

573
01:13:13,413 --> 01:13:14,971
My uncle's rich

574
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:20,048
They're afraid of him!
He acts out of self-interest!

575
01:13:21,321 --> 01:13:24,290
He'd rob me of my name
and my property!

576
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,588
It's outrageous!

577
01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:29,189
Follow me

578
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:11,002
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?

579
01:14:17,977 --> 01:14:20,241
You asked to see this man

580
01:14:27,053 --> 01:14:28,418
Do you know him?

581
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,729
Yes... it's him

582
01:14:40,366 --> 01:14:41,890
Who is he?

583
01:14:43,469 --> 01:14:45,130
What's his name?

584
01:14:47,673 --> 01:14:49,800
It's Arnaud

585
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,078
They call him Pansette

586
01:15:03,923 --> 01:15:05,220
Where's he from?

587
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,623
Our village

588
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:11,792
He's from Tihl

589
01:15:11,964 --> 01:15:13,295
You're sure?

590
01:15:13,866 --> 01:15:17,233
He left a long time ago
but that's him

591
01:15:19,472 --> 01:15:21,599
Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?

592
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:25,232
No... Arnaud, from Tihl

593
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:27,443
Called Pansette

594
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:31,716
Look at them!

595
01:15:32,785 --> 01:15:36,346
They're sent by my uncle!

596
01:15:39,058 --> 01:15:41,049
Bought and paid for!

597
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:44,819
Look at them...
shame written on their faces!

598
01:15:45,164 --> 01:15:48,258
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified

599
01:15:50,002 --> 01:15:53,460
So what? My uncle has influence

600
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,331
Why should I pretend?

601
01:15:56,509 --> 01:15:59,478
To have a house and a wife

602
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:04,238
But it's my house and my wife!

603
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:06,647
I’m wronged... and I'm accused!

604
01:16:11,924 --> 01:16:14,620
Never was a husband so maligned!

605
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:18,423
But I'll appeal...
to the Parliament here!

606
01:16:18,931 --> 01:16:21,331
I want my uncle to be punished

607
01:16:23,035 --> 01:16:24,866
So it'll all be clear!

608
01:16:25,037 --> 01:16:27,062
I want them all here

609
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,804
First Pierre, guilty
of bearing false witness

610
01:16:32,778 --> 01:16:34,973
Also my sisters and cousins

611
01:16:36,649 --> 01:16:40,517
And my wife who was forced
to sign, and all the villagers

612
01:17:54,026 --> 01:17:56,586
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years

613
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:59,128
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him

614
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:06,294
When he left, he was thinner,
darker and a bit stooped

615
01:18:07,907 --> 01:18:11,638
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips

616
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,637
And a hairy mole on his neck

617
01:18:15,448 --> 01:18:16,710
Show us

618
01:18:18,551 --> 01:18:19,916
Here, in the neck

619
01:18:23,823 --> 01:18:25,848
There's no trace of it

620
01:18:30,796 --> 01:18:34,493
And a scar above
his right eyebrow...

621
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:36,690
...also not there

622
01:18:36,869 --> 01:18:40,032
No, sir... that's wrong!

623
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:42,873
I knew Martin
when he was little, too

624
01:18:43,142 --> 01:18:47,306
I diapered him... and saw
him naked, more often than you!

625
01:18:50,249 --> 01:18:52,080
He had no hairy mole

626
01:18:52,485 --> 01:18:56,148
He had a scar on his forehead...
and still has!

627
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:01,883
It was closer to his eyebrow

628
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:06,327
It was here... I ought to know

629
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:09,726
He fell in the barn,
I picked him up

630
01:19:11,337 --> 01:19:13,532
Also... open your mouth...

631
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,271
...he broke two teeth

632
01:19:17,443 --> 01:19:20,435
There they are, in back

633
01:19:21,947 --> 01:19:24,939
And a pushed-in thumbnail!

634
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:32,249
So you maintain that he is
Martin Guerre?

635
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,353
I’m sure, sir...
as sure as night follows day

636
01:19:38,864 --> 01:19:40,195
May I speak?

637
01:19:42,868 --> 01:19:44,563
I’ve seen death

638
01:19:45,771 --> 01:19:50,674
I've heard the roar of cannon
and the screams of the wounded

639
01:19:52,712 --> 01:19:57,411
You wish me ill, Uncle,
but I've lived through worse

640
01:19:58,117 --> 01:20:00,210
But must that be a man's fate...

641
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:02,354
...for wanting to live
a little...

642
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,354
...before returning
to his family...

643
01:20:06,058 --> 01:20:07,889
...to work the land God gave us?

644
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,453
Don't let him talk any more!

645
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:14,522
He's clever with words

646
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:16,864
We know who he is now

647
01:20:17,503 --> 01:20:19,903
All he wanted was
my nephew's property

648
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:25,536
I don't want to take it,
I'm defending it!

649
01:20:27,379 --> 01:20:30,109
He's not my nephew!

650
01:20:30,282 --> 01:20:33,012
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it

651
01:20:33,285 --> 01:20:36,220
Cobbler... step forward

652
01:20:39,191 --> 01:20:41,421
Is it sure they'll let me go?

653
01:20:42,962 --> 01:20:45,931
If I say what I have to say,
can I leave?

654
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:49,957
I guarantee you'll return
to your village

655
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:57,938
Before he left, Martin had
a very large foot

656
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,945
His size was 12 points

657
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:08,114
After he came back...

658
01:21:09,622 --> 01:21:12,591
...his size was only 9 points!

659
01:21:15,561 --> 01:21:16,960
You're quite sure?

660
01:21:17,997 --> 01:21:22,593
Yes, and in my trade
I've seen feet grow bigger...

661
01:21:23,402 --> 01:21:26,735
...but I've never known
feet to shrink

662
01:21:28,941 --> 01:21:31,341
You're getting old!
Your sight's going...

663
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:33,209
You forget things

664
01:21:33,746 --> 01:21:36,010
I see better than you,
you old mule!

665
01:21:36,215 --> 01:21:38,615
You see where your interest lies!

666
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:42,753
Jacmette, your fingers remember

667
01:21:56,101 --> 01:22:00,561
Tell them who I am...
Tell the truth

668
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:18,419
You're Martin Guerre

669
01:22:20,392 --> 01:22:24,852
Bertrande, my wife, you know me
better than anyone

670
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:28,431
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield

671
01:22:29,735 --> 01:22:32,670
Swear it on the Holy Gospel

672
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:36,098
You won't swear it?

673
01:22:37,476 --> 01:22:39,376
Therefore I am your husband?

674
01:22:40,946 --> 01:22:42,971
You are my husband

675
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:50,811
Come forward, Bertrande

676
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,404
And this cross?

677
01:23:07,339 --> 01:23:09,273
I didn't draw it

678
01:23:11,977 --> 01:23:14,969
Then why didn't you protest?

679
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,807
They threatened me

680
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,582
To throw me out.
- She's lying...

681
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,818
that cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!

682
01:23:24,256 --> 01:23:27,157
They'll do anything...
They tried to kill me!

683
01:23:27,326 --> 01:23:30,818
It's her mark...
I saw her sign it!

684
01:23:31,397 --> 01:23:33,058
I didn't sign!

685
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:37,265
I would've signed my name!

686
01:23:38,871 --> 01:23:41,840
How? You can't write!

687
01:23:43,442 --> 01:23:45,637
I’d like a quill and some paper

688
01:24:14,473 --> 01:24:16,202
All this fuss over money!

689
01:24:16,608 --> 01:24:19,668
Pierre knows it's his nephew

690
01:24:22,748 --> 01:24:26,343
Mass at six in the morning,
for everyone

691
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:47,737
Pierre, how long
are we staying here?

692
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:51,171
I don't know...
As long as it takes

693
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:01,209
Who pays for it?

694
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:02,649
I’ll pay you

695
01:25:03,222 --> 01:25:05,747
Enough to live on...
that's the law

696
01:25:08,027 --> 01:25:09,995
Who is Bertrande de Rols?

697
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,857
Why do you want her?

698
01:25:13,165 --> 01:25:14,860
She's to be lodged separately

699
01:25:28,881 --> 01:25:30,314
It's me, Bertrande de Rols

700
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:35,616
Follow me with your children,
by order of the Parliament

701
01:25:45,264 --> 01:25:50,201
Blessed Virgin Mary,
see my distress and my sorrow

702
01:25:53,972 --> 01:25:55,872
Please, help me

703
01:25:57,509 --> 01:26:00,672
Protect me. I feel so lonely...

704
01:26:15,227 --> 01:26:17,127
I brought some chestnut bread

705
01:26:19,231 --> 01:26:20,698
It's from our village

706
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,275
It's cold here

707
01:26:33,745 --> 01:26:37,476
My only child...

708
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:41,610
Do you want to ruin us?

709
01:26:42,521 --> 01:26:46,457
But for you, that impostor
would have been executed by now

710
01:26:47,793 --> 01:26:49,818
He seems to have bewitched you

711
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:52,960
You're under a spell...
You only see him

712
01:26:53,799 --> 01:26:57,530
All he's after is our property

713
01:26:58,337 --> 01:27:00,828
Your husband has bewitched
you.

714
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:03,474
My own mother attacks us

715
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:09,240
If he isn't my husband,
why did you wait three years?

716
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:11,583
I wasn't clear before

717
01:27:11,817 --> 01:27:14,945
Now we know he's not Martin

718
01:27:16,088 --> 01:27:18,386
I was always suspicious of him

719
01:27:21,293 --> 01:27:24,820
He uses you and you say "Amen!"

720
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:29,793
He's my husband... I know he is

721
01:27:33,105 --> 01:27:37,565
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?

722
01:27:37,843 --> 01:27:41,438
Accused, sit down and
stay seated!

723
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:44,244
Continue

724
01:27:45,517 --> 01:27:46,245
Didn't he?

725
01:27:46,585 --> 01:27:49,748
Money to pay for killing me!

726
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:57,518
Call Dominge Pailhas

727
01:28:13,812 --> 01:28:16,280
Don't be afraid

728
01:28:16,848 --> 01:28:21,376
Did Pierre offer you money?

729
01:28:22,054 --> 01:28:24,284
Be honest... yes or no?

730
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:29,124
Yes, he offered me money

731
01:28:30,128 --> 01:28:33,188
I said I wouldn't kill
a relative...

732
01:28:33,365 --> 01:28:34,957
...even for money

733
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,962
I'm sort of related to Martin

734
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:41,036
It's true, that's what he said

735
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:48,673
Thank you. You may go now

736
01:28:49,081 --> 01:28:50,912
Come, Jeanne.

737
01:28:53,986 --> 01:28:55,112
Speak up now.

738
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,279
Didn't Uncle urge my wife
to accuse me?

739
01:29:04,963 --> 01:29:06,328
It's true

740
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:10,868
Didn't he threaten
to throw her out?

741
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:14,000
It's true.

742
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:17,237
Didn't he raise his hand to her?

743
01:29:19,845 --> 01:29:21,437
It's a lie!

744
01:29:27,853 --> 01:29:31,516
Let me talk to her husband

745
01:29:31,723 --> 01:29:33,918
Accused, remain seated!

746
01:29:36,428 --> 01:29:37,918
Come, Augustin

747
01:29:41,233 --> 01:29:43,167
You lived under our roof

748
01:29:43,502 --> 01:29:46,164
After the soldier had
been there...

749
01:29:47,072 --> 01:29:49,597
...you said: Be careful

750
01:29:49,775 --> 01:29:53,438
My uncle was sending people
after me to beat me up

751
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:54,907
Remember?

752
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:56,774
To teach me a lesson

753
01:29:59,217 --> 01:30:02,709
You must remember.
We'd beaten the Vals team...

754
01:30:02,888 --> 01:30:04,446
...4- 2. A Sunday in August!

755
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:12,493
I remember

756
01:30:14,032 --> 01:30:15,624
It's true

757
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:20,300
So, Uncle, you thought
I'd never find out?

758
01:30:23,075 --> 01:30:25,236
He's the impostor...
the criminal!

759
01:30:25,544 --> 01:30:28,206
He should be sitting here

760
01:30:32,184 --> 01:30:34,914
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...

761
01:30:36,088 --> 01:30:37,248
...who profaned God...

762
01:30:37,422 --> 01:30:39,686
...what do I care?

763
01:30:41,259 --> 01:30:43,523
I’m not Arnaud of Tihl!

764
01:30:48,467 --> 01:30:49,764
I’m not this man!

765
01:30:55,874 --> 01:30:57,171
I’m not!

766
01:31:20,065 --> 01:31:23,330
The man's memory is prodigious...

767
01:31:23,735 --> 01:31:26,226
...and he's very clever

768
01:31:28,373 --> 01:31:30,273
What if he were a demon?

769
01:31:33,678 --> 01:31:35,669
It has happened before

770
01:31:36,248 --> 01:31:39,240
Demons like to enter
human beings...

771
01:31:39,418 --> 01:31:41,443
...and poison their minds

772
01:31:43,622 --> 01:31:45,214
What do you say?

773
01:31:49,928 --> 01:31:52,556
Lies have a thousand faces...

774
01:31:53,298 --> 01:31:55,061
...even the Demon's

775
01:31:56,301 --> 01:31:58,269
Truth has only one

776
01:31:59,504 --> 01:32:00,596
And justice exists...

777
01:32:01,173 --> 01:32:03,539
...to discover the truth

778
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:13,976
Jacmette Cayrol has gone to God

779
01:32:27,165 --> 01:32:31,693
Beat the devil out of him!

780
01:32:32,437 --> 01:32:35,031
Stop fighting

781
01:32:37,309 --> 01:32:40,506
Stop it! Jacmette is dead!

782
01:32:43,782 --> 01:32:45,682
Jacmette is dead

783
01:33:08,306 --> 01:33:12,402
He knew everything better than
anyone in the village

784
01:33:14,713 --> 01:33:16,374
When he came back...

785
01:33:17,516 --> 01:33:19,746
...he knew my sons' names

786
01:33:21,853 --> 01:33:24,879
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move

787
01:33:26,024 --> 01:33:28,686
I felt that I was...

788
01:33:29,027 --> 01:33:30,756
...on fire!

789
01:33:39,004 --> 01:33:41,268
I’m sure he uses magic

790
01:33:42,874 --> 01:33:45,342
Even here, with all of us!

791
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:48,144
Since the world began...

792
01:33:48,313 --> 01:33:51,077
...Satan has had a store of magic

793
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,511
How can he know so much?

794
01:33:55,186 --> 01:33:57,848
And have all the answers?

795
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:00,815
He is the Devil's emissary

796
01:34:01,059 --> 01:34:03,584
Perhaps he is a devil himself!

797
01:34:03,762 --> 01:34:05,593
I’m not a devil...

798
01:34:05,997 --> 01:34:08,056
Be seated

799
01:34:10,101 --> 01:34:13,127
If a devil is in you, speak

800
01:34:13,905 --> 01:34:15,600
Tell us his name

801
01:34:17,709 --> 01:34:20,371
A devil?
Then I'd be with my wife!

802
01:34:20,545 --> 01:34:22,775
I wouldn't have been arrested!

803
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:24,677
I wouldn't be here!

804
01:34:28,753 --> 01:34:30,778
He answered well

805
01:34:31,323 --> 01:34:34,224
There's no proof of any magic

806
01:34:35,193 --> 01:34:37,388
What should we do?

807
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:39,994
Any suggestions?

808
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:43,964
The most humane solution...

809
01:34:44,703 --> 01:34:47,831
Presume innocence if guilt
is not proven

810
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:51,667
But first...

811
01:34:52,377 --> 01:34:56,143
...I'd like another chance
to question...

812
01:34:56,314 --> 01:34:58,612
...Martin Guerre's wife

813
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,061
The Court turns to you

814
01:35:22,474 --> 01:35:23,873
Now...

815
01:35:25,076 --> 01:35:26,907
...and for the last time...

816
01:35:28,213 --> 01:35:29,908
...I ask you...

817
01:35:30,882 --> 01:35:33,282
...if that man is your husband

818
01:35:33,451 --> 01:35:36,352
Yes... I'm sure

819
01:35:38,289 --> 01:35:41,884
How can you be
absolutely certain?

820
01:35:43,061 --> 01:35:46,428
Speak... We are here to learn all

821
01:35:54,172 --> 01:35:56,572
On his return,
he knew all about me

822
01:36:01,746 --> 01:36:04,510
Did he know intimate details...

823
01:36:04,683 --> 01:36:06,742
...only a husband could know?

824
01:36:16,127 --> 01:36:19,460
What details?

825
01:36:26,538 --> 01:36:29,598
He knew when I wanted him...

826
01:36:30,175 --> 01:36:32,268
...and the words to say

827
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:33,905
Before...

828
01:36:34,646 --> 01:36:36,011
...during...

829
01:36:36,247 --> 01:36:37,874
...and after

830
01:36:44,289 --> 01:36:45,688
The Court...

831
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:50,025
...will now retire to deliberate

832
01:36:58,837 --> 01:37:00,737
I think that does it

833
01:37:03,641 --> 01:37:07,042
This peasant seems to have
won his case

834
01:37:07,178 --> 01:37:09,009
He's Martin Guerre

835
01:37:09,147 --> 01:37:11,547
It would be inhuman
not to free him

836
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,477
We'll clear his name

837
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:17,652
Could anyone else
have defended him better?

838
01:38:03,535 --> 01:38:06,800
In the name of the King
and of his justice...

839
01:38:08,106 --> 01:38:10,472
...this Parliament...

840
01:38:11,042 --> 01:38:13,374
...hereby declares...

841
01:38:13,478 --> 01:38:16,311
...that the accused is indeed...

842
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:20,744
...is indeed Martin...

843
01:38:26,391 --> 01:38:32,352
A new witness insists
on being heard

844
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,131
Have him come forward

845
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:28,776
You claim to be Martin Guerre?

846
01:39:29,487 --> 01:39:31,785
Yes... that's my name

847
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,589
Where were you?

848
01:39:44,102 --> 01:39:45,296
In Picardy... the Army

849
01:39:47,872 --> 01:39:50,170
I lost my leg at St. Quentin

850
01:39:50,808 --> 01:39:54,141
When I arrived in Artigat,
I heard my family was here.

851
01:39:54,879 --> 01:39:56,141
Here I am

852
01:39:57,015 --> 01:39:58,915
Do you know that man?

853
01:40:03,254 --> 01:40:05,415
We soldiered together

854
01:40:06,424 --> 01:40:08,119
His name?

855
01:40:08,226 --> 01:40:10,626
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette

856
01:40:10,795 --> 01:40:12,763
Don't listen! Look at them...

857
01:40:13,031 --> 01:40:15,795
Having lost, they try a ruse!

858
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,898
A beggar, hired by my uncle!

859
01:40:23,274 --> 01:40:25,367
Do you know that woman?

860
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:35,913
Bertrande, my wife

861
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,953
It's one last low trick!

862
01:40:42,593 --> 01:40:44,823
You wrong me...
and you insult me?

863
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,497
Wrong you?

864
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:51,100
I’ve never laid eyes on you!

865
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:54,197
Why don't you arrest him?

866
01:40:54,372 --> 01:40:56,533
A hired liar!

867
01:40:58,643 --> 01:41:01,339
Pierre Guerre, come forward.
Where is your wife?

868
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:15,119
Do you know this man?

869
01:41:16,461 --> 01:41:20,522
Yes, I recognize him

870
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,301
Martin, my nephew

871
01:41:26,537 --> 01:41:32,271
Let me hug you.
At last you're back

872
01:41:33,978 --> 01:41:35,741
You're quite sure?

873
01:41:36,047 --> 01:41:37,571
Yes, I'm sure

874
01:41:38,449 --> 01:41:40,314
He's my brother's son

875
01:41:44,322 --> 01:41:47,416
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God

876
01:41:48,259 --> 01:41:50,250
Arrest him!
- Sit down!

877
01:41:53,898 --> 01:41:56,594
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...

878
01:41:56,768 --> 01:41:58,759
...just in time, like a miracle!

879
01:41:58,903 --> 01:41:59,892
It's God's doing

880
01:42:01,672 --> 01:42:04,800
The hand of God,
manifesting itself

881
01:42:04,976 --> 01:42:06,637
It's divine justice

882
01:42:06,811 --> 01:42:08,244
God has sent him...

883
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:10,447
...to prevent injustice!

884
01:42:27,832 --> 01:42:29,993
Don't forsake me!

885
01:42:32,103 --> 01:42:34,435
It's a plot against me

886
01:42:35,673 --> 01:42:37,368
In my own family!

887
01:42:37,909 --> 01:42:44,246
Please listen to me once more...

888
01:42:45,383 --> 01:42:48,614
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat

889
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,182
He's a paid liar

890
01:42:50,354 --> 01:42:54,586
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him

891
01:42:56,527 --> 01:42:59,018
Let me put him to the test!

892
01:43:12,477 --> 01:43:14,536
You claim to be me! Tell me...

893
01:43:15,947 --> 01:43:18,177
...on my wedding night...

894
01:43:18,749 --> 01:43:21,013
...who gave us the nuptial bowl?

895
01:43:29,193 --> 01:43:31,286
She did. Catherine Bore...

896
01:43:31,462 --> 01:43:32,895
She tucked us in

897
01:43:33,531 --> 01:43:35,761
Just after the wedding
I was bewitched

898
01:43:35,933 --> 01:43:37,924
How many masses were said for me?

899
01:43:41,772 --> 01:43:44,639
It's so long ago... and I'm tired

900
01:43:50,181 --> 01:43:51,876
Answer!

901
01:43:52,783 --> 01:43:56,810
Six...
- He's wrong! He doesn't know!

902
01:43:57,121 --> 01:43:58,816
Not six... four!

903
01:44:00,024 --> 01:44:03,152
Dominique Caylar, answer.
Tell the truth

904
01:44:04,028 --> 01:44:07,259
I said four masses, it's true

905
01:44:13,738 --> 01:44:16,798
You should have been
better informed

906
01:44:17,909 --> 01:44:20,537
Where was the spell broken?

907
01:44:21,012 --> 01:44:22,445
At the priest's

908
01:44:23,648 --> 01:44:25,673
Was it hot or cold?

909
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,613
Cold... I was naked

910
01:44:27,919 --> 01:44:32,754
We warmed up quickly!

911
01:44:38,062 --> 01:44:42,931
Who bought the sacks of grain
I stole?

912
01:44:44,835 --> 01:44:46,735
Smallpox Andre

913
01:44:46,904 --> 01:44:49,202
You learned that lesson well

914
01:44:53,077 --> 01:44:57,104
When I went away,
what did I leave...

915
01:44:57,281 --> 01:44:59,511
...in the linen-chest upstairs?

916
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:03,250
What did I leave?

917
01:45:03,421 --> 01:45:05,719
I left it! What was it?

918
01:45:10,995 --> 01:45:13,520
White breeches!

919
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:17,462
Sewn by Bertrande...
and you didn't know!

920
01:45:17,635 --> 01:45:19,967
But I told you.
- No, I told you!

921
01:45:20,137 --> 01:45:22,662
Don't twist it around!
Arrest him!

922
01:45:23,374 --> 01:45:25,672
I’ve proven I'm Martin Guerre

923
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:30,579
You say you told him?

924
01:45:30,748 --> 01:45:33,080
And he's trying to use it!

925
01:45:33,251 --> 01:45:35,048
But before you said...

926
01:45:35,786 --> 01:45:38,152
...you didn't know him

927
01:45:47,832 --> 01:45:49,356
Accused, sit down

928
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:55,732
The sisters, come here

929
01:46:06,017 --> 01:46:08,815
Which one is your brother?

930
01:46:10,554 --> 01:46:12,852
Make up your minds

931
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,791
This is my brother

932
01:46:28,739 --> 01:46:31,435
No, you're making a mistake!

933
01:46:31,609 --> 01:46:35,909
And you, Guillemette?
What do you say?

934
01:46:37,948 --> 01:46:40,109
I can't remember

935
01:46:40,284 --> 01:46:41,979
I was too little

936
01:46:43,054 --> 01:46:45,716
Maybe it's him

937
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,790
He's my father!

938
01:46:48,526 --> 01:46:50,892
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!

939
01:46:51,228 --> 01:46:54,356
Silence!

940
01:47:03,441 --> 01:47:07,343
What do you say?

941
01:47:08,312 --> 01:47:10,109
Of no importance...

942
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:12,110
I'm not family

943
01:47:12,283 --> 01:47:15,616
Catherine... tell them

944
01:47:55,326 --> 01:47:56,657
Forgive me, Martin

945
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:01,527
Don't cry... Women cry easily

946
01:48:02,566 --> 01:48:05,831
You should have known
your own husband

947
01:48:07,605 --> 01:48:10,233
Our house is dishonored

948
01:48:10,641 --> 01:48:12,472
It's all your fault

949
01:48:16,313 --> 01:48:19,077
You're to blame, Martin

950
01:48:23,621 --> 01:48:25,953
You betrayed my friendship

951
01:48:27,725 --> 01:48:29,556
You deserve no pity

952
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:39,735
What harm in caring for
a woman her husband deserted?

953
01:48:44,642 --> 01:48:49,272
We await your confession,
Arnaud of Tihl

954
01:48:57,421 --> 01:48:58,911
It's true

955
01:49:01,826 --> 01:49:03,885
We soldiered together

956
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:09,529
He talked about his wife...

957
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:12,061
...his son, his house

958
01:49:13,437 --> 01:49:16,668
One day on the road,
two men took me for him

959
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:18,433
They called me Martin

960
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:21,105
It gave me an idea

961
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:23,542
I thought...

962
01:49:26,917 --> 01:49:29,613
...why not take his place?

963
01:49:35,459 --> 01:49:38,451
So I learned all I could

964
01:49:38,629 --> 01:49:41,325
Martin said he wasn't going back

965
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,061
I went to Artigat

966
01:49:45,236 --> 01:49:47,101
I was taken for him

967
01:49:51,442 --> 01:49:53,376
I almost told them...

968
01:49:53,544 --> 01:49:56,445
"I fooled you!
Martin's up north!"

969
01:49:56,881 --> 01:49:58,872
I almost said it

970
01:50:03,621 --> 01:50:05,418
Then I saw you

971
01:50:09,059 --> 01:50:11,493
I took you in my arms

972
01:50:14,298 --> 01:50:16,596
Next day, it was too late

973
01:50:19,603 --> 01:50:22,902
After that, I learned
whatever I didn't know...

974
01:50:23,207 --> 01:50:26,574
...from my uncle, sisters, wife

975
01:50:27,778 --> 01:50:30,212
And I remember it

976
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:44,116
There's no magic in it...

977
01:50:45,863 --> 01:50:48,058
...I swear it

978
01:50:54,772 --> 01:50:59,072
You don't deserve her

979
01:51:00,044 --> 01:51:02,604
I know her better than you do

980
01:51:11,589 --> 01:51:17,653
I ask you all to forgive me

981
01:51:21,732 --> 01:51:23,097
And you...

982
01:51:24,668 --> 01:51:26,135
...who were my wife

983
01:51:45,222 --> 01:51:48,521
Your men can stay in the barn

984
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,487
Are you thirsty?

985
01:51:51,762 --> 01:51:53,889
Where's Bertrande?

986
01:51:54,098 --> 01:51:55,827
At home

987
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,633
Pierre Guerre, you brought
discord to this village

988
01:51:59,970 --> 01:52:01,961
Now keep the peace

989
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:17,978
Leave us, please

990
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:50,984
I'm thirsty

991
01:53:03,067 --> 01:53:09,006
You have dared much
and feared God very little

992
01:53:12,876 --> 01:53:15,902
We hesitated before
declaring you innocent

993
01:53:18,215 --> 01:53:23,278
It was unwise to take
that stranger into your bed

994
01:53:25,856 --> 01:53:27,517
Women are often the victims...

995
01:53:27,691 --> 01:53:30,091
...of men's wickedness

996
01:53:36,667 --> 01:53:39,261
That's why we acquitted you...

997
01:53:40,771 --> 01:53:42,830
...and legitimized...

998
01:53:43,407 --> 01:53:44,806
...your daughter's birth

999
01:53:45,642 --> 01:53:48,372
We hope that now...

1000
01:53:48,946 --> 01:53:51,437
...you will be a good wife

1001
01:53:55,986 --> 01:53:58,352
But tell me...

1002
01:53:59,223 --> 01:54:01,453
...so I'll understand

1003
01:54:06,797 --> 01:54:09,265
Before Arnaud appeared...

1004
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,832
...you needed a man?

1005
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:18,231
And this one pleased you?

1006
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:25,006
Did he satisfy your needs?

1007
01:54:29,586 --> 01:54:31,884
You loved each other?

1008
01:54:36,326 --> 01:54:39,625
You knew from the start?

1009
01:54:40,330 --> 01:54:42,093
You can tell me

1010
01:54:42,266 --> 01:54:44,325
It will go no farther

1011
01:54:49,773 --> 01:54:51,240
Arnaud and I...

1012
01:54:54,478 --> 01:54:56,446
...were good together

1013
01:54:59,683 --> 01:55:01,878
Martin had neglected me

1014
01:55:03,687 --> 01:55:05,712
Arnaud respected me...

1015
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:08,551
...like a true husband

1016
01:55:10,694 --> 01:55:12,628
I trusted him

1017
01:55:16,867 --> 01:55:20,166
We thought of asking to be judged

1018
01:55:21,805 --> 01:55:23,830
We could have won

1019
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:33,277
If Martin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife

1020
01:55:34,785 --> 01:55:37,379
No one could've denied it

1021
01:55:38,455 --> 01:55:40,548
At the last minute...

1022
01:55:40,724 --> 01:55:42,453
...why did you change?

1023
01:55:44,561 --> 01:55:46,756
Why choose Martin?

1024
01:55:53,804 --> 01:55:55,931
In Arnaud's eyes...

1025
01:55:59,476 --> 01:56:01,706
...I saw it was hopeless

1026
01:56:06,149 --> 01:56:08,379
I saw what he wanted

1027
01:56:17,794 --> 01:56:20,160
He wanted me to live...

1028
01:56:21,031 --> 01:56:23,556
for me and my children

1029
01:56:25,769 --> 01:56:27,964
So I did it

1030
01:56:50,994 --> 01:56:53,656
God forgive me,
I defiled marriage!

1031
01:56:53,964 --> 01:56:59,129
The King, the law,
all those I offended...

1032
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:03,296
...forgive me!

1033
01:57:06,376 --> 01:57:07,968
Get up, Arnaud

1034
01:57:27,297 --> 01:57:29,959
Open the door

1035
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:30,449
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!

1036
01:58:31,161 --> 01:58:34,255
The King, the law...

1037
01:58:35,465 --> 01:58:38,025
...all those I offended!

1038
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:59,980
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!

1039
01:59:00,957 --> 01:59:03,482
The King, the law...

1040
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:07,293
...all those I offended!

1041
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:54,772
Commend your soul to God

1042
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:16,493
The story of false
Martin Guerre...

1043
02:00:16,766 --> 02:00:18,961
...ended that morning

1044
02:00:20,237 --> 02:00:25,504
The Counselor, Jean de Coras
impressed by this...

1045
02:00:25,675 --> 02:00:28,269
...daring imposture,
made a record of it

1046
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:31,379
12 years later came...

1047
02:00:31,781 --> 02:00:34,443
...the St. Bartholomew Massacre

1048
02:00:34,751 --> 02:00:37,447
For his Protestant beliefs...

1049
02:00:37,621 --> 02:00:41,648
...Jean de Coras was hung before
the Toulouse Parliament...

1050
02:00:42,058 --> 02:00:44,822
...with a hundred of his friends

1051
02:00:46,463 --> 02:00:49,227
But we live only by the spirit
