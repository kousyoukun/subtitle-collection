1
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,099
Shit!

2
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,409
Crazy-drivin' motherfucker.

3
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,996
-Shit.
-Come on.

4
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,335
Marvin, what are you doin'?

5
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,754
-He's mine. Get lost.
-He's yours? He's mine.

6
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,715
Eddie assigned him to me.

7
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,217
Then go talk to Eddie.
l'll collect the money.

8
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,138
l almost got killed tryin' to get this guy.
He shot at me--

9
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,932
Back off, goddamn it!
l said l'm takin' him, all right?

10
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,268
-All right, Marvin.
-This guy's worth $1,200!

11
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,937
Marvin. What are we fightin' for?
We're friends--

12
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,566
Nothin' personal, Jack, but fuck off!

13
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,943
Take it easy. Jesus!

14
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:31,946
Marvin, watch out!

15
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:35,491
What the fuck's goin' on?
You guys ain't cops.

16
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,577
No, we're ballet dancers.

17
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,788
Didn't your mother teach you
how to react to strangers?

18
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:42,290
Not shoot at them?

19
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,310
Thanks for the car.

20
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,856
You sleep,
and l'll bring it back a little later.

21
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,423
Got a delivery for you, Gooch.

22
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,386
Jack. The soda machine's been out
for a week and a half.

23
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,431
Check that for me.

24
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,517
What do we got here?

25
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,857
-Give you any trouble?
-Did you give me any trouble?

26
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:45,151
-Fuck you!
-He didn't give me any trouble.

27
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:46,820
Fuck you, too, man!

28
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,197
-Move!
-l know my motherfuckin' rights!

29
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:54,620
Slap it.

30
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,801
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

31
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:50,432
No, it's cash only. No checks, no cards.

32
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:55,855
l'm sorry, ma'am. That's the policy.
l wish l could help you out. Sorry.

33
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:01,277
Just dropped off Bouchet. ls Eddie in?

34
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:03,571
So you finally caught someone, Jack.

35
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,531
Jerry, is he in?

36
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,743
l think that's terrific.

37
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,706
l been tryin' to reach you.
What do you got for me?

38
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:13,582
Been tryin' to reach me? lt's Bouchet.

39
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,128
-Bouchet. Good. $900, right?
-No, it's $1,200.

40
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,379
No, $900.

41
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,381
That's $1,200. Come on.

42
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,342
No. Yeah, you're right.

43
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:29,141
My stomach's killin' me. l'm goin'
to Chin Loo's. l want to talk to you.

44
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,476
About what?

45
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:34,147
-l'll talk to you over there.
-Could l have my money first?

46
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:35,690
Of course.

47
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:37,776
Do you think l'm gonna stiff you?

48
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,070
You? Never!
He would never try and stiff me.

49
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,155
-Do l detect some sarcasm here?
-Never.

50
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,992
Where have l inherited this reputation?

51
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:48,413
l have never done business with anybody,
and Jerry is my witness...

52
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,498
...that l have ever, ever....

53
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:54,336
Has that phone ever rang
with a complaint about me?

54
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,172
Never. So let's go.
l'll buy you some breakfast.

55
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,675
-l don't eat breakfast.
-Then have an early lunch.

56
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:05,932
You ever hear of a guy named Mardukas?

57
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,351
-The Duke. l know who he is.
-What do you know?

58
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:13,106
He's an accountant that embezzled millions
from a Vegas guy and gave it to charity.

59
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,986
Only thing is, that it wasn't a couple
of million. lt was $15 million.

60
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,114
lt wasn't some Vegas wise guy.
lt was Jimmy Serrano.

61
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,368
l know. l can read the papers.

62
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:26,371
l don't want to bring up the past, but...

63
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:31,043
...isn't Serrano the guy who ran you out
of Chicago when he was runnin' things?

64
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,211
He didn't run me out.

65
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:35,130
Right. You gave up bein' a cop
to do this shit?

66
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:38,968
-What's the point?
-The point, Jack:

67
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:42,639
l bailed out the accountant.
l didn't know who he was at the time.

68
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:45,767
Had l known,
no way l would've put up the bond.

69
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:49,730
lt's only a matter of time
before Serrano makes this guy vanish...

70
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:51,482
...and l'm out $450,000.

71
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:53,902
You're out $450,000 on this guy?

72
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,236
-No.
-No.

73
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:59,658
Because l got you, and you're the best,
and you're gonna find him.

74
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:03,579
How do you even know this guy is alive?

75
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:07,750
Because this guy is crazy.
He sends postcards to Serrano.

76
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,337
He's tellin' him what a great time
he's havin' with his money.

77
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,089
How much time you got left?

78
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:15,592
Friday at midnight l default.
l eat the $450,000.

79
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,761
This Friday? That's five days.

80
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:21,640
-Forget it. Give me my money.
-Listen to me.

81
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,269
l'll give you.... l'll give you $50,000.

82
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:27,271
$50,000? l gotta chase you down
for $1,200. Forget it.

83
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,400
-No, please.
-Forget about it. What else you got?

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,362
l ain't got nothin'. lf you don't find
this guy, l'm out of business.

85
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,368
l'll do it for a $100,000.

86
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:43,748
$100,000? Are you out of your mind?
This is an easy gig. lt's a midnight run.

87
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:46,460
lf you haven't noticed,
l'm tired of gettin' shot at.

88
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,130
l'm tired of this miserable business,
every lowlife that l run into.

89
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:52,383
lf you're gonna pay me,
you gotta pay me right.

90
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:55,010
You want me for this job,
give me what's right.

91
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,556
First of all, the guy is an accountant.
He's not gonna shoot you.

92
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,728
All you have to do is find him.
You put him in a bag, bring him home.

93
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:05,021
That's easy for you to say.

94
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,234
lt's $100,000, no more, no less,
and l want a contract.

95
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,986
-Contract?
-That's right, and l want it in writing.

96
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,781
$100,000, and l'll have the Duke for you
by Friday.

97
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,992
Now, can l have my $1,200, please?

98
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:23,084
Man, you do worse than any crook
l ever put a bond up for.

99
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:33,595
Stanley.

100
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,312
Big Dog. How are you?

101
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,606
What are you doin' here?

102
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,275
Listen, l need a favor.

103
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,947
l need to see the booking slip
of a Jonathan Mardukas. M-A-R-D-U-K-A-S.

104
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,042
-Yes, sir.
-What's that?

105
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:05,714
The number he called
right after he was arrested.

106
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,050
212 area code.

107
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,637
Looks like l'm goin' to New York.

108
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,396
Are you Jack Walsh?

109
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,859
-Excuse me.
-Are you Jack Walsh?

110
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,110
Do l know you?

111
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,987
Alonzo Mosely, FBl.

112
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:30,240
That's a nice badge.
How can l get one of those?

113
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:33,578
-l want to talk to you.
-Why don't you call my social secretary?

114
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,164
You're very funny. l want to talk to you.

115
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:38,583
Take your hands off me!

116
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,006
Take it easy!

117
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:50,138
-You know it's a $10 fine for jaywalking--
-Shut up.

118
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:51,514
What l want to know is...

119
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:54,935
...are you working on anything
having to do with Mardukas?

120
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,520
Never heard of him.

121
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,607
l believe you have heard of him.

122
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,651
Let me tell you something, asshole.

123
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:06,531
We've been working on this
Jimmy Serrano thing for about six years.

124
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,282
Mardukas is my shot.

125
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,203
l'm gonna bring him into federal court...

126
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:15,166
...and l don't want any rent-a-thug
who couldn't cut it as a cop in Chicago...

127
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,293
...bringing him to LA
on some bullshit local charge.

128
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:29,139
Do l make myself understood?

129
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,308
Can l ask you something?

130
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:34,645
These sunglasses, they're really nice.

131
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,941
Are they government issued or do
you all go to the same store to get them?

132
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,781
Do l make myself understood?

133
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,659
Can't you take a joke?

134
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:49,578
Get him out of here.

135
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,499
No, let's talk some more.

136
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,209
-Get out of here.
-lf l hear anything, l'll tell you.

137
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:57,087
Good-bye. Have a nice day.

138
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:05,095
-Think l could have my sunglasses back?
-Here's your sunglasses.

139
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,019
Thanks. Thanks for this, too.

140
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,860
''Alonzo Mosely.''

141
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,832
How's that?

142
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,544
Looks fine to me.

143
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:14,881
Harold Longman, please.

144
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:19,678
Harry? Jack Walsh. How're you doin'?

145
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,932
You got that address check
on that phone number for me?

146
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:30,440
Thanks a lot, Harry.
Say hello to Julie for me. 'Bye.

147
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,866
You Jack Walsh?

148
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:43,037
-Who wants to know?
-Answer, ''Yes.''

149
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,331
We'd like to have a word with you.

150
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,669
-Yeah? What about?
-lt involves big cash, lot of prizes.

151
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,545
l'll make it short and sweet.

152
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,382
The people l work for are really interested
in your visit.

153
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,050
Who are the people you work for?

154
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:57,553
A friend of yours from the Chicago days.

155
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:02,433
You're here for the Duke. You think
he's in New York. We think you're right.

156
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:05,062
That's a nice jacket. What is it, goatskin?

157
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,981
Come on, Joey, please. Will you?
Never mind him.

158
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,151
The way l hear it...

159
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,987
...you didn't cooperate
with my boss a few years ago.

160
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,616
-ls that the way you heard it?
-But l got a news flash for you.

161
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:19,745
He'd pay a lot more for the Duke
than that bail bondsman.

162
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,664
-How much more?
-How about a one with six zeroes?

163
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,044
Are you gonna propose?

164
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:28,420
-Propose?
-Propose.

165
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:31,424
-'Cause if you're not, quit starin' at me.
-Starin' at you?

166
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:33,426
-You're staring at me.
-Joey, back off.

167
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:38,015
Mr. Walsh, your car's located
in space number 206.

168
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:41,227
You can catch our shuttle bus
just through these doors.

169
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:44,146
Here's my number, Jack.
Ask for Tony Darvo. That's me.

170
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:48,860
They'll put you through to wherever l am.
And be good to yourself this time. Okay?

171
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,282
Tell Jimmy l said hello.

172
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:32,533
-Hello?
-Hello? Mrs. Nelson?

173
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,412
Alonzo Mosely, Federal Bureau
of lnvestigation. How are you?

174
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:38,164
l'm fine.

175
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,876
Let me get right to the point, Mrs. Nelson.

176
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:45,464
An agent in LA discovered a detail
that was somehow overlooked until now.

177
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,758
lt seems that when Mardukas
was arrested...

178
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:51,304
...you were the first person he called.
ls that correct, Mrs. Nelson?

179
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:54,849
-Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
-Yes.

180
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:57,686
This is a matter of great concern to us.

181
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:02,024
We'd like you to come down
tomorrow morning to 26 Federal Plaza.

182
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,235
Do you think you could do that?

183
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:06,529
-l suppose so.
-About 9:00 a.m.?

184
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,700
-Yes.
-Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely.

185
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:13,620
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

186
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,814
-Hello?
-Dana? lt's Helen.

187
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:40,817
The FBl called.
They want to speak to me about Jonathan.

188
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:44,571
-Oh, my God! Helen.
-Helen, what's going on?

189
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:48,242
The FBljust called. They know
we spoke the night you were arrested.

190
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,661
Hang up the phone, Helen. Right now.

191
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,584
Sweet music.

192
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,526
-What is it?
-l don't know.

193
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:14,028
Okay. Heidi.

194
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:17,574
Alonzo Mosely, FBl! You're under arrest!

195
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:20,576
Get this dog out of here!

196
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:23,413
Not you. You stay there.
Get the dog, ma'am.

197
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:24,331
-Do it.
-Get the dog!

198
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:27,376
Heidi. Come on, girl.

199
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:30,713
Don't move,
or l'll shoot you through the glass.

200
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,515
Get over here.
Put your hands up against the wall.

201
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,100
Spread your feet.

202
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,440
Relax. There won't be a problem.

203
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:51,986
Put your left hand behind your head.

204
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,046
You're taking me to the airport?

205
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,094
You don't look like an FBl agent to me.

206
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,556
Yeah? You don't look like a duke to me.

207
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,769
lf you're an FBl agent,
why don't you take me to the FBl office?

208
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,814
lf you don't be quiet, this is going
to be the worst trip of your life.

209
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,651
You work for Jimmy Serrano?

210
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,111
l don't work for that him.

211
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:33,074
Your bondsman hired me to bring you
back to LA, and that's what l'm doing.

212
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,159
-l got money.
-l'm sure you do.

213
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,996
-l'll give you whatever you want.
-Start by shutting up.

214
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,999
l've known you two minutes,
and already l don't like you.

215
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,710
That's too bad. l really like you.

216
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,550
l can't keep you cuffed
on a commercial flight.

217
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,427
l gotta check my gun with my luggage.

218
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:53,722
You fuck with me once,
l'll break your neck.

219
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:55,807
-l can't fly.
-What?

220
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:59,019
-You heard me. l can't fly.
-You'll have to do better than that.

221
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:03,191
l don't have to do better, 'cause it's
the truth. l suffer from aerophobia.

222
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,150
What does that mean?

223
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:07,778
lt means l can't fly. l also suffer
from acrophobia and claustrophobia.

224
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:11,783
l'll tell you what. lf you don't cooperate,
you'll suffer from ''fistophobia.''

225
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:18,206
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

226
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,418
Jerry, put Eddie on the phone.

227
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,795
Jack, what's the progress?

228
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,172
-l got him.
-You got who?

229
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,632
The Duke. He's right here.

230
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,717
You got him? Already?

231
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,595
Sure do. Want to say hello?

232
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,097
Say hello to your bail bondsman,
Eddie Moscone.

233
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,348
Hello.

234
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:35,851
There you go.
Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh.

235
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,103
Jack, l love you!

236
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:39,605
What happened? Where'd you find him?

237
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,233
l found him in New York.
We're at the airport.

238
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:45,319
This is wonderful news!

239
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:48,782
l'll be in your office by midnight
and l'm tellin' you...

240
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:50,993
...l want the money tonight.

241
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:53,162
Go empty out
one of your Swiss bank accounts.

242
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:56,708
You don't have to worry.
This is the best money l've ever spent.

243
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,878
-Okay. See you in a few hours.
-All right. l'll see you later. 'Night.

244
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:06,009
-So what's that all about?
-Jerry Walsh got the Duke!

245
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,847
-Walsh got the Duke?
-He got him! He got the Duke!

246
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,767
No kiddin'? This calls for a celebration.

247
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,853
l'll get some donuts.

248
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:20,901
How do you think Walsh found him so fast?

249
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,169
Tony, this is Jerry.

250
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,130
-Jerry who?
-Jerry Geisler.

251
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:42,174
-What are you doing?
-Eating dinner. What do you want?

252
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:45,720
Look, l hate to bother you
but l thought you'd like to know...

253
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,723
...that Walsh found the Duke in New York.

254
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,894
They're flyin' in tonight.
They should arrive around midnight.

255
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,648
-Don't forget me, babe.
-Yeah, kid.

256
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,733
Thanks. Good night.

257
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,213
Looks like your old friend
found the accountant.

258
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:20,008
They'll be flying into LA around midnight.

259
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:24,179
Have them met at the airport.

260
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,599
-You understand?
-Done.

261
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:32,022
-Can l take your coat?
-That's fine. Thanks.

262
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,898
-May l take your coat?
-No.

263
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:38,487
First class is nice.
l could make a habit out of this.

264
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:41,198
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening to you.

265
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:43,367
Would either of you like a drink?

266
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:46,203
Yes, we would like
one of your finest champagnes.

267
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:47,454
Certainly.

268
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,709
Let's see. Look at this.

269
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:55,380
Only in America. What a country.

270
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,634
Unbelievable.

271
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:01,720
l think l'm gonna have the steak.
How about you?

272
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,807
l'm not hungry.

273
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:08,311
Why don't you get the lobster,
because then l'll get a little surf and turf'.

274
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,897
l got a problem.

275
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:13,108
l can't fly. You're not takin' me seriously.

276
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,654
-l'm takin' you very seriously.
-l can't be on this plane.

277
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,739
You think l haven't heard this before?

278
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:21,242
Who do you think you're traveling with?
A novice?

279
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,536
Know what l'm talkin' about?

280
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:29,084
That's it. Settle in. lf you want to get up
and mingle with the other passengers...

281
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,254
...be my guest. You ain't goin' nowhere.

282
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:33,839
There's a couple
of nice-lookin' people here.

283
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,634
Better class of people.

284
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:39,387
Your class. Probably all embezzlers, too.

285
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,853
''Come fly with me, come fly away''

286
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,575
Why don't you just try and relax?

287
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:09,546
Just calm down.
Just relax and calm down.

288
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:13,592
-What are you gettin' so excited about?
-lt's not--

289
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:18,389
No! l can't! l can't.

290
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:21,934
No! l can't! l can't.

291
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,229
Just relax! What did l tell you?

292
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,316
-Now, don't pull that shit on me--
-No. l'm tellin' you, l can't do it.

293
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,487
-These things go down!
-All right.

294
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,117
lt's too big! lt can't go up!

295
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,373
All right, everyone. Just calm down.

296
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:45,294
-What's the problem?
-lt's nothing, sir. lt's okay.

297
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,630
Alonzo Mosely, FBl. He's in my custody.
l'm taking him to LA.

298
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:52,093
-There won't be any more problems.
-l don't want to fly. l can't.

299
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:55,930
You can't make a prisoner fly
if he doesn't want to. You should know.

300
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:58,766
l do. l'm sorry. l thought he was bluffing.

301
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:02,187
l suggest you find some other mode
of transportation.

302
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:13,533
-What the fuck are you smilin' about?
-l love to travel by train.

303
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:16,370
Yeah? What do you think this is,
a class trip?

304
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,664
Are you always this angry?

305
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:20,874
Look. Right now l'm in a great mood.

306
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:24,086
Wait till l'm cooped up on that thing
and you won't be smilin'.

307
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:26,172
You'll be runnin' for that jail cell.

308
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,300
Still gonna make your schedule?

309
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,594
l'll make it, 14 hours to spare.

310
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:36,391
Nice. lt's a double.

311
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:39,937
-There'll be a lot of room.
-Glad you like it.

312
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:45,902
Thanks, 'Cause they're starting
to cut into my wrists. Thank you.

313
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:48,155
lt just gets the skin after a while.

314
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,991
-Get in there.
-What do you want? What?

315
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:53,160
Come on.

316
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:57,164
-Why would you do that?
-You'll enjoy yourself.

317
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,668
This is my room, and that's your room.
Good night.

318
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:19,564
-Can l help you guys?
-Special Agent Mosely, FBl.

319
00:26:19,772 --> 00:26:23,610
-Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely?
-What the hell are you talking about?

320
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:27,198
-You're here to pick up a prisoner, right?
-How did you know that?

321
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,992
He was afraid to fly,
so he got off the plane.

322
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:32,203
He left with an Agent Mosely.

323
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:36,250
Sir, that must mean that Walsh
has your identification.

324
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:43,549
Yeah?

325
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:47,095
ls this Moron Number 1?
Put Moron Number 2 on the phone.

326
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:50,014
Yeah, Jimmy. He's, right here. Hold on.

327
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:51,474
He's pissed.

328
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:56,813
You told me this guy
would be on the plane.

329
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:58,566
That's the information we got.

330
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,443
''That's the information we got.''

331
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,946
l want this guy taken out,
and taken out fast.

332
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,824
You two better start getting more involved
in your work...

333
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:10,037
...or l'll stab you in the heart with a pencil.
You understand?

334
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,288
You got it.

335
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,340
He ain't mad at me, is he?

336
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,351
Jack, l think this is illegal.

337
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:35,357
Jack, l don't think you can keep a person
in a bathroom like this.

338
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:39,653
-lt's very claustrophobic in here--
-Yeah, it is?

339
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:43,949
When we get to LA, you can tell
the prison psychiatrist about it.

340
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:46,744
There's no air.
There's no ventilation in here.

341
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:49,663
l told you l was claustrophobic. Come on.

342
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:53,710
What do you think l'm gonna do?
Jump off a train moving 90 miles an hour?

343
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,474
Good. Thanks.

344
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:13,023
Thanks a lot.

345
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:19,697
-Sit down.
-Yeah, that's great. Very kind of you.

346
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,831
Nice, much better. Thank you. Good.

347
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,548
What are you doing?

348
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,758
What am l doin'?

349
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,762
-Arithmetic.
-Arithmetic?

350
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,474
Maybe l can help you. l am an accountant.

351
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:47,769
You know what l was thinkin',
after l turn you in and collect my money...

352
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,939
...l'm gonna open a nice little coffee shop.

353
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:52,775
How much exactly are you getting for me,
if l may ask?

354
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:57,030
l don't think that's any of your concern,
but l'll tell you just to tell you.

355
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:00,576
-$100,000.
-$100,000?

356
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:03,078
Does that mean you'd take $100,000
to let me go?

357
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,164
Not by a long shot.

358
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:07,249
$200,000?

359
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:11,004
l never took a payoff in my life,
and l won't start with someone like you.

360
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,214
-Why not?
-Because you're a criminal.

361
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:16,635
You deserve to go where you're goin',
and l'm gonna take you there.

362
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,303
lf l hear any more shit from you...

363
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:21,724
...l'll bust your head,
l'll put you back in that hole...

364
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:26,646
...l'll stick your head in the toilet bowl
and make it stay there.

365
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:34,988
l have to tell you,
a restaurant is a very tricky investment.

366
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,992
More than half of them go under
within the first six months.

367
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:41,036
lf l were your accountant,
l'd have to advise you against it.

368
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:42,914
You would? You're not my accountant.

369
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,666
lf l were your accountant--

370
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,459
l told you, l took you out here--

371
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:49,505
No, l'm just saying that
it's a very tricky business and...

372
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:55,219
...if l were your accountant, l'd really have
to advise you against it, as an accountant.

373
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:58,765
-You're not my accountant.
-l realize l'm not your accountant.

374
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:03,145
l'm just saying if l were your accountant.

375
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:12,530
How the hell could he miss the plane?
He called from the airport!

376
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:18,036
All right. Time to bring in Marvin.
Call him up. He's in Pittsburgh.

377
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:19,955
-Marvin Dorfler?
-Yeah, Dorfler.

378
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,207
Under ''D'' in the Rolodex for ''jerk,'' Jerry.

379
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,796
Can l at least have some french fries?

380
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,299
l said no, pecker breath. Now shut up.

381
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:38,725
Dorfler.

382
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,729
Marvin? Sweetheart, am l glad l got you!

383
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:44,732
-Boy, do l have ajob for you!
-Yeah? l'm listening.

384
00:30:44,857 --> 00:30:47,569
l gotta apologize,
because we were trying to find you...

385
00:30:47,652 --> 00:30:50,280
...and it's an important job,
but l couldn't find you.

386
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:52,074
l had to give it to Walsh, but now...

387
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:53,200
...he's fucking it up--

388
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,077
Why do you keep hiring that guy?

389
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,457
l know. l apologize. You are the best
at what you do. You know that?

390
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:01,126
Do you know who Mardukas is?

391
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:03,753
-No.
-Jonathan Mardukas, the Duke?

392
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:06,548
-l never heard of him.
-That's not important.

393
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:09,760
What's important is that you find him
and bring him back.

394
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:13,931
Last l heard, he had him in New York,
and now l don't know where they are.

395
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:16,559
lfyou find him,
l'll give you what l'm givin' Walsh.

396
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:17,602
What's that?

397
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:20,313
$25,000.

398
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:23,942
You gotta have him back by Friday,
midnight, or the deal's off.

399
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:27,612
Don't worry, Eddie. For $25,000,
l'll bring him in on a silver platter.

400
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:30,116
Bring him any way you want,
but bring him.

401
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:35,747
Hey, scumbag.

402
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:37,832
My name's Carmine, fucko.

403
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,627
Carmine, today's your lucky day.

404
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:44,090
-Why is today my lucky day?
-Shut up!

405
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:47,009
Yeah, my name is Jack Walsh.

406
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:49,387
Excuse me. John Wesley Walsh.

407
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:51,723
Yeah, l think l lost my credit card.

408
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:54,310
Can you tell me the last place l used it?

409
00:31:55,978 --> 00:32:00,983
Yeah, 731-483-9521-13.

410
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:04,653
The Amtrak office, Grand Central Station?

411
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:08,491
Yeah. l remember that now.

412
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:10,369
Okay. Thanks very much.

413
00:32:12,454 --> 00:32:14,539
Maybe we ought to cancel that card?

414
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:16,626
Yeah. Thank you.

415
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:35,688
Familiar with the word ''arteriosclerosis''?

416
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,859
''Cholesterol''?

417
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:44,281
lf you want, l'll outline
a complete balanced diet for you.

418
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,366
Mail it to me from C-Block.

419
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:50,288
Why would you eat that?

420
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,956
Why? 'Cause it tastes good.

421
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,292
-But it's not good for you.
-l'm aware of that.

422
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:57,295
Why would you do something,
if you know it's not good for you?

423
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:58,881
Because l don't think about it.

424
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:00,299
That's living in denial.

425
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:02,384
-Living in denial?
-Yeah.

426
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,804
l'm aware of that.

427
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:07,932
You're aware of your behavior
yet you continue to do things...

428
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:09,392
...that aren't good for you.

429
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:11,686
That sounds sort of foolish.
Don't you think so?

430
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:15,232
No. Stealing $15 million
from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.

431
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:19,821
l didn't think l'd get caught.

432
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:21,697
Now, that's livin' in denial.

433
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:23,240
l'm aware of that.

434
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:25,035
You're aware of your behavior...

435
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,163
...and yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.

436
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:30,249
Sounds foolish to me. Don't you think?

437
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,417
lt was foolish.

438
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,628
But taking $15 million in mob money
and giving it to charity...

439
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:36,297
...was good for a lot of people.

440
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:40,176
You pissed off a Mafioso killer
to be loved by a bunch of fuckin' strangers.

441
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,511
That makes a lot of sense.

442
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:43,388
Don't you want to be loved?

443
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:47,351
Lots of people love me.

444
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:48,811
Really?

445
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:52,565
Who?

446
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,736
l got an ex-wife,
and l got a daughter in Chicago.

447
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:02,868
How do they put up with all your sarcasm?

448
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:05,913
Beautifully. l haven't seen either of them
in nine years.

449
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:07,874
Think maybe we should go see them?

450
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:12,462
No, l don't think maybe we should go
see them. Thanks for the interest, though.

451
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:14,798
The job must have been tough on them.

452
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:16,966
-l didn't do this then.
-What did you do?

453
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,553
-l was a cop.
-You were a cop in Chicago?

454
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,975
Then you must know
all about Jimmy Serrano.

455
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,978
Do you have the right
to ask these questions?

456
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:28,730
-l think l do.
-No, you don't.

457
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:30,231
-l think l do.
-No, you don't.

458
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,358
Why not?

459
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,069
Dinner 's over. Let's go.

460
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,243
l can see this is gonna be some fuckin' trip.

461
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:43,996
l wouldn't worry about it.
l won't be with you much longer.

462
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,831
What do you mean?

463
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:48,751
With what l know about Serrano,
if l go to jail l'll be dead within 24 hours.

464
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:52,005
So sooner or later,
l'm gonna have to give you the slip.

465
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,011
Glad you find it humorous.

466
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,642
-Let's go.
-$2? That's all you're gonna leave?

467
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,519
-That's 15 percent.
-That's 13 percent.

468
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,106
These people depend on tips for a living.

469
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:41,852
Can l help you, sir?

470
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:46,232
Yeah, l'm lookin' for a buddy of mine,
Jack Walsh.

471
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,652
He told me he'd meet me on this train.

472
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:52,822
Yeah, Mr. Walsh.
He's in Bedroom D, next car.

473
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:56,160
-That next car?
-Yes, sir. That way.

474
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:59,163
-Thanks.
-Sure thing. Have a good night.

475
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,336
One word and you're dead, asshole.

476
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:54,307
-How did you find out where l am?
-l ain't tellin' you shit!

477
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:56,643
You'll force me to do something
l don't want to!

478
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:58,812
-What's going on?
-Everything's under control.

479
00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:00,981
Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBl.

480
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:05,278
Radio ahead. l want the police
at the next stop to place him under arrest.

481
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:07,781
-What are you talkin' about?
-That's enough!

482
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:09,574
Get on the horn and call the cops.

483
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,254
ls this good news or bad news?

484
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,717
Mardukas and Walsh
are on the Amtrak headed to Los Angeles.

485
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:29,888
Another bounty hunter was arrested
after he tried to take Mardukas away.

486
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,682
l want the jet ready in 20 minutes.

487
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:04,092
-Where's Jack Walsh?
-He got off with the other guy...

488
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:05,970
...two or three stops ago.

489
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:08,472
His real name's Mosely.

490
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,474
l'm Mosely!

491
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:18,275
l want to make a collect call
to Eddie Moscone from Jack Walsh.

492
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:24,657
-Moscone's Bail Bonds.
-Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on.

493
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:28,286
-Jesus, Jack! Where have you been?
-Jack, l want to talk to him.

494
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:29,329
Where are you?

495
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:31,206
l want to ask you something.

496
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:34,835
How come Dorfler wound up on my ass?
Did you put him on this?

497
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,588
Dorfler? How could l put Dorfler on you?

498
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:40,383
-l don't know where you are.
-You had nothin' to do with it?

499
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,259
Where are you? You got the Duke?

500
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,971
-You're damn right l got him.
-Where are you?

501
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:48,726
Where am l? l'm somewhere
between Toledo and Cleveland.

502
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:50,602
-We're gettin' on a bus.
-Bingo.

503
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:53,105
Bus? What, are you out of your mind?

504
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:56,442
Shut up for a minute.
We're gettin' on a bus.

505
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:59,029
ljust wanted to let you know
we're on our way.

506
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:00,405
Don't hang up!

507
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:04,160
Shit! What the hell is this guy doin'?

508
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:05,619
l don't know.

509
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,375
Maybe l ought to get some donuts?

510
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,978
Two one-way tickets
to Los Angeles, please.

511
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:31,565
Still gonna make our schedule?

512
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,443
Don't worry. l'll get you there on time.
Don't have any illusions.

513
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:38,072
-lllusions?
-lllusions.

514
00:39:39,823 --> 00:39:42,535
l'm sorry, sir. This card's been cancelled.

515
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,745
Has it been cancelled?

516
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,998
That's a mistake.
Would you please try it again?

517
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:49,918
-l checked it twice, sir.
-Please try it again.

518
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:53,088
-Did you pay the bill?
-Shut up.

519
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:54,840
l'm sorry, sir. lt's been cancelled.

520
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:58,678
That's impossible. l pay my bills.
lt could not be cancelled.

521
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:00,680
-lt's been cancelled.
-Shut up!

522
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,348
lt's cancelled, sir.

523
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:05,477
-Would you like to try another card?
-l don't have another card.

524
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,855
-Or cash.
-Would you just try that again?

525
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,356
-No.
-All right.

526
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:12,776
Alonzo.... Jack Walsh.

527
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,654
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

528
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:17,365
This is an official business.
This man is in my custody.

529
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,702
l'm taking him to Los Angeles.
So please try this once more.

530
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:24,665
Jack Walsh is not the name
on that badge, sir.

531
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,671
Would you like me to call the FBl?

532
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:33,424
Or would you like to pay cash?

533
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:39,807
-How much is it?
-$264 for two tickets.

534
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,933
$264.

535
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:43,018
Here's $100.

536
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:50,944
-Got any money on you?
-A lot.

537
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,912
You call that a lot of money?

538
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:02,206
lt's enough to get you
where l'm gonna get you.

539
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,255
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

540
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:11,091
Got the whole fuckin' force after me.

541
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,945
Who the fuck are you?

542
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,364
Special Agent Mosely, FBl.

543
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,742
Goddamn it! l didn't do anything.

544
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,453
Relax. Just want to ask you
a few questions.

545
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,748
Yeah. Fucking A. Help yourself.

546
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,556
So, what do you know about Jack Walsh?

547
00:41:59,562 --> 00:42:02,272
No. Come on. Cigarettes are killers.

548
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:04,149
So are women.

549
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:07,570
Not the right woman. My wife
and l have a wonderful relationship.

550
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:08,946
She's stuck it out with me.

551
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:11,992
Stuck it out with you and all your millions.
What a trooper.

552
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:15,412
l don't have millions, Jack.
l gave it all to charity, remember?

553
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,498
You didn't keep just a little for yourself?

554
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:20,500
l kept enough to get away and stay hidden.

555
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:24,797
We change buses in Chicago.
You're gonna have a couple hours.

556
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:28,343
l think you'd be a better man
if you looked up your ex-wife and daughter.

557
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:32,431
-lt's a perfect opportunity.
-Why don't you mind your own business?

558
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:39,605
Why is it you haven't seen them
in nine years?

559
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:41,065
-Why?
-Yeah.

560
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,194
l'll tell you why.
She married a police lieutenant...

561
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:46,905
...and l'm not popular
with the Chicago Police.

562
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,825
-Why aren't you popular with them?
-That's a whole other....

563
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,785
Do we know each other?

564
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:53,871
-Why?
-Why?

565
00:42:54,622 --> 00:42:55,957
What did you do?

566
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,877
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police?

567
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,296
That's something that doesn't concern you.

568
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,008
-Did she hurt you, Jack?
-Yeah.

569
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,636
-l'm sorry.
-What are you sorry about?

570
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:10,056
-l'm sorry you're hurt.
-l'm not hurt.

571
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:12,558
-You said you were hurt.
-l'm not hurt.

572
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:15,270
-You said you were hurt.
-l didn't say it. You said it.

573
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:17,355
l asked you and you said, ''Yeah, l'm hurt.''

574
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,484
You made me say it.
You're startin' to put words in my mouth.

575
00:43:20,568 --> 00:43:23,070
You're a grown man.
You have control over your words.

576
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:26,407
You're goddamn right l do.
Here come two words for you: Shut up!

577
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:35,709
Excuse me. Walsh called Moscone about
a half an hour ago from outside Toledo.

578
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:40,590
He's on an lnterstate Coach Lines bus
headed for Chicago.

579
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:46,346
Come on.

580
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:49,599
Sir, what do we do with this guy?

581
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,186
Let him go.

582
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:59,694
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.

583
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,823
When's the last time
you had a chest X-ray?

584
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,536
You know about secondary smoke?

585
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,705
You could give people lung cancer...

586
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:12,834
...who are innocent
and tryin' to live healthy lives.

587
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:16,587
Why don't you just go back to sleep?
Leave me alone.

588
00:44:16,796 --> 00:44:19,299
-Do whatever you have to do.
-Put the cigarette out.

589
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:21,384
Why don't you shut up and leave me alone?

590
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,387
Put the cigarette out, Jack.

591
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:27,724
Put the cigarette out.

592
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:30,478
A pain in the ass this guy is.

593
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,021
Thank you.

594
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:35,984
-l thought you were putting it out.
-No, l'm not putting it out.

595
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:38,696
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police?

596
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:43,283
Sid's downstairs.

597
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,250
-What's up?
-l think you and l should talk.

598
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,252
Why are you hangin' around? Take a walk.

599
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:55,589
-Somebody picked up Mardukas.
-lt's old news. We're on it.

600
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:58,092
Do you know what'll happen
if he becomes a witness?

601
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:02,055
-That will not be the case.
-l assumed you were taking that position...

602
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,265
...but l am to advise you
against such action.

603
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:08,436
Relax. Have a cream soda. Everything
will be all over with in a few minutes.

604
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,526
Who the fuck are these guys?

605
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,238
Hands on the bus!

606
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:02,121
All right, spread them.

607
00:46:08,377 --> 00:46:09,504
lt's the feds.

608
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,258
Remember me?

609
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,933
Agent Foster Grant. Alonzo, aren't you
gonna thank me for doin' your job for you?

610
00:46:22,268 --> 00:46:23,269
Thank you.

611
00:46:33,113 --> 00:46:34,531
Let's get the fuck out of here!

612
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:54,053
-What the hell are you doing?
-Keep moving.

613
00:47:02,396 --> 00:47:06,775
Wait a minute. Jesus Christ!
All right, l'm comin'!

614
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:09,904
-Come on!
-Goddamn it! All right! Wait a minute!

615
00:47:11,781 --> 00:47:14,284
Walsh, you son of a bitch!

616
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,172
-My God!
-Shut up.

617
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:27,757
-What the hell was that?
-Shut up.

618
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,343
-Why were they shooting?
-Those are Serrano's people.

619
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:32,512
They're not waiting for you to get to jail.

620
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:35,266
You're turnin' me in.
Why are we runnin' from the FBl?

621
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:39,604
l gotta bring you in myself, or l won't get
my money. l won't give you to the feds.

622
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:44,317
''Alonzo Mosely.''
lsn't that the name you've been using?

623
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,278
Let me see that.

624
00:47:48,905 --> 00:47:50,991
-Look at this wealth of information.
-What?

625
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:53,285
They got a tap on Moscone's line.

626
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,623
Son of a bitch!

627
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:01,003
What are you doin'?

628
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,883
How far do you think we'll get
in a stolen FBl car?

629
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,762
What's that for?

630
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,140
An inside joke between me and Alonzo.

631
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,601
-Tony Darvo, line one.
-Yeah?

632
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,270
Sorry. lt didn't happen.

633
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:21,734
-lt didn't happen? Say that again, Tony?
-ltjust didn't happen.

634
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:23,527
There were cops everywhere.

635
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:26,990
There were a million fuckin' feds all over.
Jimmy, it was a mess.

636
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:29,659
-lt was a real mess.
-You'd better get off the line.

637
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:32,829
-lf they've got a tap on that line--
-Shut your mouth!

638
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,127
Now listen to me, dummy.
Do they have Mardukas in custody or not?

639
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:42,005
Jimmy, l don't know.
The cops are swarming all over the place.

640
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,635
-We couldn't see anything.
-Let me tell you two dummies something.

641
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,347
l better not get another call like this.
lf l do...

642
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,683
...l'll get on a plane,
and l'll blowtorch the both of you.

643
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,268
Do you understand?

644
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:56,897
Are you gonna stop? l'm on the phone!
What are you doin'?

645
00:48:56,897 --> 00:48:59,943
l should've killed Walsh
in Chicago a long time ago.

646
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:02,945
Don't say a word to me.
Don't say a fuckin' word to me.

647
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:05,657
l'll get up and l'll bury this telephone
in your head.

648
00:49:31,394 --> 00:49:32,478
l can't believe this.

649
00:49:32,562 --> 00:49:35,899
l haven't seen them in nine years
and the first thing l say will be:

650
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:38,068
''Can l borrow a few hundred bucks?''

651
00:49:38,193 --> 00:49:41,238
l have a feeling
this will be very good for you.

652
00:49:54,044 --> 00:49:55,921
You look fine.

653
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:01,552
Who are you guys?

654
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:04,681
l'm your mother's ex-husband.

655
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:09,269
-Mom!
-Nice kid.

656
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:21,282
Hi, Gail.

657
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:23,660
-Hello.
-How're you doin'?

658
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:25,620
l'm doin' good.

659
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:34,380
They mentioned you
on the news this morning.

660
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:35,882
-They did?
-Yeah.

661
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:38,968
What did they say? Anything good?

662
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:43,682
No. Are you all right?

663
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:48,979
You're in a lot of trouble.

664
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,484
Can l come in for a few minutes, Gail?

665
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:57,656
Can l come in for a few minutes?

666
00:51:03,704 --> 00:51:07,458
l won't stay long. l just need to borrow
some money to get to LA.

667
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,669
You know l'm good for it.

668
00:51:10,378 --> 00:51:13,173
l don't think l have that kind of cash
in the house.

669
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:17,178
l'm so embarrassed. l'm just in a jam, Gail.

670
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,931
You look beautiful.

671
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,851
You don't look much like a criminal.

672
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:25,269
l'm a white-collar criminal.

673
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:27,063
Jason, go upstairs now.

674
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:32,360
You shouldn't be here.

675
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:35,406
lf Ted comes home,
he's gonna arrest you and him.

676
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:37,366
-Arrest us?
-Yeah.

677
00:51:38,535 --> 00:51:41,871
Then we'd be in trouble,
'cause l'm a little short of bribe money.

678
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:44,583
All right, Jack, don't start. Please, don't.

679
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:46,877
How is Lieutenant whatever-his-name-is?

680
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,797
-lt's captain now.
-Captain? Royalty.

681
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:52,508
l don't want any trouble.
Do you understand that?

682
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:55,220
lt is not a good day for this. l mean it.

683
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:59,056
l'm sorry my fugitive timetable
doesn't coincide with your social calendar.

684
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,476
-She wasn't saying that.
-Stay out of this.

685
00:52:01,476 --> 00:52:04,480
Your feelings get hurt
and then you hurt everybody else.

686
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:08,650
-l don't need one of your lectures!
-l'm not lecturing you! l'm protecting you!

687
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:10,987
-Come on!
-Ted will be home any minute.

688
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,072
We're going out. lt's an important night.

689
00:52:13,156 --> 00:52:15,450
What's so important about tonight?
Let me guess.

690
00:52:15,576 --> 00:52:18,245
-What's it, payoff night?
-That's it! Get out!

691
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,873
-Let's not fight.
-Gail, listen! l'm in a big jam!

692
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:23,792
l just need some money
so l can get this guy to LA...

693
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,670
...and l'm out of this business forever!

694
00:52:25,879 --> 00:52:27,672
Can't you understand that?

695
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,859
Hi.

696
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:51,615
Denise?

697
00:52:56,328 --> 00:52:57,705
You got so big.

698
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:17,393
-l'm sorry. l'm gonna go now.
-No, hold on.

699
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:27,321
l'm sorry, honey.
lt's just that we're havin' a....

700
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:37,416
What grade are you in now?

701
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:38,583
Eighth.

702
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,544
Are you in the eighth grade?

703
00:54:01,401 --> 00:54:03,778
Here's $40. That's all l've got.

704
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:07,032
Here are the keys to my car.
lt's in the driveway.

705
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:09,743
-l'll tell Ted that it's in the shop.
-Okay.

706
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:12,872
And we'll worry about it
when you get back to LA.

707
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:16,000
So, does he take good care of you?

708
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:21,714
Yeah? Well, that's all l wanted to know.

709
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:25,177
So what's he gonna say about this?

710
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:30,057
-He'll understand.
-Yeah, that's love.

711
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:33,311
'Bye, honey.

712
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:12,312
Wait.

713
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:17,109
-lt isn't much. $180 baby-sitting money.
-Sweetheart, l can't.

714
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:18,694
-Take it.
-l can't.

715
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:19,695
Please.

716
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:23,992
-Take it.
-l can't, sweetheart.

717
00:55:57,904 --> 00:56:02,242
Hello. l'd like to make a collect call
to Eddie Moscone from Jack Walsh.

718
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:07,164
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

719
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:08,917
Jerry, put Eddie on the phone.

720
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:10,501
Eddie, it's Jack.

721
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:12,795
Stop fuckin' around. Where are you?

722
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,716
Where am l? l'm in Boise, ldaho.

723
00:56:16,008 --> 00:56:18,426
No, wait a minute.
l'm in Anchorage, Alaska.

724
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:20,721
No, wait. l'm in Casper, Wyoming.

725
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,349
l'm in the lobby at a Howard Johnson's
and l'm wearing a pink carnation.

726
00:56:24,475 --> 00:56:26,144
What are you talkin' about?

727
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:28,938
l'm not talkin' to you.
l'm talkin' to the other guys.

728
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:30,315
What other guys?

729
00:56:30,315 --> 00:56:33,235
Let me describe the scene to you.
There's these guys.

730
00:56:33,235 --> 00:56:35,111
They've probably been up for two days.

731
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,406
They stink of B.O.
They have coffee breath.

732
00:56:37,615 --> 00:56:40,535
They're constipated from sitting
on their asses for so long.

733
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:44,497
They're sitting in a van and they're
probably parked right up the street.

734
00:56:44,497 --> 00:56:47,542
But now you're gonna have
to pack up and go home...

735
00:56:47,626 --> 00:56:50,045
...because l'm onto you, you dumb fucks.

736
00:56:50,337 --> 00:56:55,050
Your phone is tapped. l'm not going to use
this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo's.

737
00:56:55,134 --> 00:56:58,054
l'll call you in five minutes.
They can't run a tap that fast.

738
00:56:58,263 --> 00:56:59,722
So long, everybody.

739
00:57:03,143 --> 00:57:06,605
Excuse me, buddy. l got it!
l think it's for me. Jack, that you?

740
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,400
l need you to wire me $500
to the Western Union office...

741
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:11,068
...in Amarillo, Texas right away.

742
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,571
What do you need with $500 on a bus?

743
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,239
And why the aren't you on a plane?

744
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,119
Has it occurred to you that
l am a professional and l have my reasons?

745
00:57:19,244 --> 00:57:22,455
We're driving now, and l only have
enough cash to get to Amarillo.

746
00:57:22,581 --> 00:57:23,999
We had to scrap the bus.

747
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,835
Fuck the bus!
What happened to the goddamn plane!

748
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:31,424
-He doesn't like to fly.
-He doesn't like to fly?

749
00:57:31,632 --> 00:57:34,136
What the fuck does that mean?
Listen to me, Jack!

750
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:37,180
You gotta be back here
in less than two and a half days.

751
00:57:37,264 --> 00:57:40,601
A half million dollars of my money!
What the fuck is goin' on there?

752
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:44,856
l swear. Don't start with me now
or l will shoot him...

753
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:47,483
...and l will dump him in a fuckin' swamp!

754
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,112
l am in no fuckin' mood for this.

755
00:57:50,195 --> 00:57:52,697
Send me the money,
and l'll have him back on time.

756
00:57:52,697 --> 00:57:54,366
-You hear me?
-Yes.

757
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:56,786
Let's go.

758
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:03,459
Wire $500 to Jack Walsh
in Amarillo, Texas right away.

759
00:58:03,543 --> 00:58:05,712
Amarillo, Texas. Now, listen.

760
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:09,382
Get Dorfler down there!
Find him and get him down there, too.

761
00:58:09,716 --> 00:58:12,094
-You got it, Eddie.
-Shit!

762
00:58:33,368 --> 00:58:36,913
''Ninety-three bottles of beer on the wall''

763
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:43,921
Why were you so unpopular
with the Chicago Police Department?

764
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,423
'Cause of your personality?

765
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:52,430
What happened back at your house?
What was that all about?

766
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:55,475
Your wife married a corrupt police officer?

767
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:00,064
What was it all about?

768
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:05,487
That whole fuckin' department
was corrupt.

769
00:59:05,695 --> 00:59:07,780
There's good and bad everywhere, no?

770
00:59:07,864 --> 00:59:11,201
l'd say there's bad everywhere.
Good l don't know about.

771
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:16,123
What happened to you?

772
00:59:21,337 --> 00:59:23,297
l wouldn't go on the payroll.

773
00:59:24,882 --> 00:59:26,134
What payroll?

774
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:34,268
l was workin' undercover. l was posted
to a big heroin dealer in Chicago.

775
00:59:34,476 --> 00:59:36,646
He supplied the whole city.

776
00:59:37,397 --> 00:59:39,982
Took me a year just to get his confidence.

777
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:44,696
Just when l was about to nail
the son of a bitch, my fellow officers...

778
00:59:44,905 --> 00:59:48,659
...mysteriously discovered seven pounds
of heroin in my house.

779
00:59:49,076 --> 00:59:52,205
So this big-time drug dealer
gave me a choice:

780
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:57,419
Get on the payroll like everybody else,
get out of town, or go to jail for 30 years.

781
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,338
l didn't get on the payroll.

782
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:02,508
And that's why l do this.

783
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:06,178
When l find a criminal like you,
l bring him in.

784
01:00:06,262 --> 01:00:11,267
l don't have to worry about takin' a payoff
because there's just me.

785
01:00:20,778 --> 01:00:23,197
Why don't you get yourself a new watch?

786
01:00:23,782 --> 01:00:25,450
l'll tell you when l know you better.

787
01:00:25,575 --> 01:00:28,369
When will you get to know me better?
l'll get to know you better.

788
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:30,872
-You won't get to know me better.
-Will you shut up?

789
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:32,457
That's what l mean.

790
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:55,065
How much money do we have left?

791
01:00:58,945 --> 01:01:00,739
-That's it?
-That's it.

792
01:01:02,282 --> 01:01:04,493
We're starvin',
and you're buying cigarettes?

793
01:01:04,576 --> 01:01:06,037
l need these cigarettes.

794
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,831
You can have your whatever. l'll have this.

795
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,749
What can l do for you boys?

796
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,085
Coffee, please.

797
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,550
-How much is the coffee?
-lt's 53 cents.

798
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:21,178
-How much is tea?
-53 cents.

799
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,058
l'll have tea.

800
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,978
Our breakfast special today
is chorizo and eggs.

801
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,481
-Chorizo and eggs?
-Chorizo and eggs. Yes.

802
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,859
-What is that?
-lt's a Mexican sausage...

803
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:37,112
...mixed with scrambled eggs.
lt comes with hash browns and toast.

804
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,407
Won't be havin' that. Thank you.

805
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:46,914
What time you got?

806
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:50,252
Ten to nine.

807
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:53,380
ln 10 minutes we'll be at Western Union,
we'll have $500...

808
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,800
...and l'll buy you a steak
or whatever you want.

809
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,220
Chorizo and eggs?

810
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:03,182
-Chorizo and eggs?
-l'll get you whatever you want.

811
01:02:07,062 --> 01:02:07,979
You know...

812
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:12,359
...you're in this mess because you're
in this mess. l didn't put you in this mess.

813
01:02:12,568 --> 01:02:14,028
Do you understand?

814
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:19,033
lf you had left Serrano alone,
this wouldn't be happening.

815
01:02:22,162 --> 01:02:23,747
Thank you.

816
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:28,419
l had a way out of this, you know.

817
01:02:31,006 --> 01:02:33,633
What's the thing Serrano's most afraid of?

818
01:02:36,762 --> 01:02:38,847
Goin' cross-country with you.

819
01:02:43,352 --> 01:02:45,729
Gettin' knocked off by his own people.

820
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:50,193
What l know of his financial transactions
would put him away...

821
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:52,821
...and every mob guy he did business with.

822
01:02:52,946 --> 01:02:55,032
That's why he wants to kill me.

823
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:58,369
l was gonna put all his records
on computer disks.

824
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:01,705
l figured if things rough,
l could trade them for my life.

825
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:02,832
So what happened?

826
01:03:02,957 --> 01:03:06,461
What happened was l got arrested
before l had a chance to do it.

827
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:09,214
Why didn't you just leave him alone?

828
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:13,051
You don't look like the kind of guy
who'd be involved in that--

829
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:15,763
Why didn't you leave
that heroin dealer alone?

830
01:03:17,848 --> 01:03:19,726
l was a mob accountant.

831
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:23,062
l thought l worked in a legitimate firm.

832
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:25,983
When l learned l was managing accounts
for Serrano...

833
01:03:26,066 --> 01:03:28,068
...l couldn't sit back and do nothing.

834
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:30,571
But, you still took
what didn't belong to you.

835
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:32,573
How can you be on the side of a mobster?

836
01:03:32,656 --> 01:03:35,368
-l'm not on his side.
-You are if you're not on my side.

837
01:03:35,493 --> 01:03:37,453
l'm not on anyone's side.
l got nothing to do with it.

838
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:41,500
You got everything to do with it.
You're takin' me to jail where l'll be killed.

839
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:44,002
-That's not my problem.
-lt's not your problem?

840
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,796
lt's not your problem?

841
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:49,842
Did you read about me in the papers?

842
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,053
-l did.
-Were you on my side then?

843
01:03:52,053 --> 01:03:53,930
-Yeah, l was.
-Then why aren't you now?

844
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:56,642
-Because now you're in my way.
-l'm in your way?

845
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,935
What you want is the money
for turning me in...

846
01:03:59,019 --> 01:04:03,107
...because that's all you're about.
You're just about the fuckin' money.

847
01:04:08,446 --> 01:04:10,531
You think whatever you want to think.

848
01:04:10,615 --> 01:04:14,578
Doesn't matter 'cause l'm gettin'
my $100,000 any which way you want it.

849
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:23,463
Let's go.

850
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:33,474
Tony, you got your camera?
Take a picture.

851
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:36,477
They got these at the airport.
Should l get one?

852
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,811
Come on. Put that away.

853
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:39,814
l'm not gonna tell you again.

854
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:43,151
There they are.

855
01:04:53,162 --> 01:04:55,165
-How you doin', Jack?
-Shit.

856
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:56,916
Jimmy sends his regards.

857
01:04:58,584 --> 01:05:00,045
Don't worry, Jack.

858
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,673
We're not here for you. We're here for him.

859
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:05,885
What are you starin' at?

860
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:07,678
Are you gonna propose?

861
01:05:10,682 --> 01:05:11,850
Drop them!

862
01:05:11,933 --> 01:05:13,685
l said, ''Drop them,'' assholes!

863
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:21,027
Who the fuck are you guys?

864
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,695
Who the fuck are you?

865
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:31,955
You're dead.
You know who you're fuckin' with?

866
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:36,459
No. Why don't you tell me about it?
Make sure you speak into the microphone.

867
01:05:41,632 --> 01:05:44,260
Very clever, Jack. Now give me the keys.

868
01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:46,554
Come on! Give me the keys!

869
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:48,849
Keys.

870
01:05:51,977 --> 01:05:53,854
Looks like a package deal to me, Marvin.

871
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:56,065
Goddamn it. Come on! Both of you!

872
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,571
Who the hell were those guys?

873
01:06:01,654 --> 01:06:03,866
-You did it this time.
-What are you talkin' about?

874
01:06:03,991 --> 01:06:05,659
Those are hired killers back there.

875
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:08,245
-Hired to kill who?
-Hired to kill this guy.

876
01:06:08,328 --> 01:06:11,165
-Me. Can you believe it?
-Hired by who?

877
01:06:11,165 --> 01:06:13,667
Hired by who? Jimmy Serrano.
That's who.

878
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:15,962
Fuck. Why do they want to kill this guy?

879
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:17,922
Don't you read the papers, knucklehead?

880
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:20,008
-l read the papers.
-l can't take this.

881
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:24,012
They got away. Grey Dodge.
Get after them.

882
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:25,765
How did you know where we were?

883
01:06:25,765 --> 01:06:27,933
-l can't take this.
-Did Eddie put you on this?

884
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:30,353
-Of course.
-That son of a bitch!

885
01:06:30,437 --> 01:06:32,856
-l have a contract with him?
-You got a contract?

886
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:34,607
-l signed it on Monday.
-He called me.

887
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:38,195
-He said you were fucking this thing up.
-l'm not fuckin' anything up.

888
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:40,030
You should've been in LA two days ago.

889
01:06:40,155 --> 01:06:43,200
Don't tell me how to do my job!
l'm thinkin' not to turn him in...

890
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:45,452
...just to watch Eddie go down the toilet.

891
01:06:45,578 --> 01:06:48,498
-That's a good thought.
-What? Who the hell's talkin' to you?

892
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:51,418
Who's talkin' to you?
He's not yours to take anymore.

893
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:53,378
-He's mine.
-Do you hear that?

894
01:06:54,963 --> 01:06:57,133
Fuck! Now who the fuck is this?

895
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,972
Jesus Christ!

896
01:07:04,766 --> 01:07:06,142
Do something!

897
01:07:09,062 --> 01:07:13,317
You guys are the dumbest bounty hunters
l've ever seen!

898
01:07:17,906 --> 01:07:20,325
You couldn't even deliver a bottle of milk!

899
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,416
Will you shut the fuck up?

900
01:07:35,633 --> 01:07:37,302
Where the hell did he go?

901
01:07:38,011 --> 01:07:40,764
-Think we lost him?
-Don't know. l don't see anything.

902
01:07:40,847 --> 01:07:42,849
l'm sure we're completely safe.

903
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:10,046
-You all right?
-Yeah, l'm fine. l'm enjoying it.

904
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:13,383
-Marvin, give me a gun.
-No fuckin' way!

905
01:08:17,972 --> 01:08:20,474
-Will you give me a gun?
-Give him a gun!

906
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:22,560
Don't fuck me, Jack!

907
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:34,031
Shit.

908
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,828
They're not after me. Just kidding.

909
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:42,791
-Thought you threw those away.
-Always check the evidence.

910
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:44,459
Those were car keys.

911
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:56,764
Son of a bitch! There goes $100,000.

912
01:08:56,973 --> 01:08:59,184
$100,000? He was gonna
pay you $100,000?

913
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,979
-Why? What was he gonna pay you?
-$25,000.

914
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:04,899
Son of a bitch!

915
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:36,726
Holy shit, Jack! You got him!

916
01:09:52,868 --> 01:09:54,954
What the hell are you doin', Jack?

917
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,334
See you in LA.

918
01:10:56,897 --> 01:10:58,774
Where the fuck are you?

919
01:11:01,403 --> 01:11:05,239
Give me your hand. l'm slipping.
l can't hold on. Give me your hand.

920
01:11:10,245 --> 01:11:11,581
Where are you goin'?

921
01:11:21,299 --> 01:11:22,676
Good.

922
01:11:24,011 --> 01:11:25,679
Promise you'll let me go?

923
01:11:26,013 --> 01:11:27,849
Do you promise to let me go?

924
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:32,437
-Fuck you!
-Promise to let me go?

925
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,355
Fuck you.

926
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:36,774
You're making it very difficult for me
to do the right thing here.

927
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,699
All right. l promise l'll let you go.

928
01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:02,887
Jesus.

929
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:05,265
-You all right?
-Yeah.

930
01:12:09,645 --> 01:12:11,522
Thanks for saving my life.

931
01:12:11,939 --> 01:12:13,732
Thanks for lettin' me go.

932
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:21,408
l'll let you go, all right.
The second you're in LA County Jail.

933
01:12:21,741 --> 01:12:23,201
Come on.

934
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,417
Yeah, that's right. Down here!

935
01:12:30,835 --> 01:12:32,670
Are you just gonna stand there...

936
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:35,172
...or are you gonna get me out of here?

937
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:44,266
This just came in.

938
01:12:46,686 --> 01:12:48,354
ls this gonna upset me?

939
01:12:48,521 --> 01:12:51,357
l think it's safe to say that.

940
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:56,863
Are you familiar with a dish,
a potato dish, lyonnaise potato?

941
01:12:57,614 --> 01:13:01,451
lt's a kind of fried potato.

942
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:04,789
But it's got an onion in it.
lt's quite delicious.

943
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:09,711
lt really goes beautifully
with steak, chops...

944
01:13:10,545 --> 01:13:13,674
...hamburger, cheeseburger,
any of your meat dishes.

945
01:13:13,799 --> 01:13:15,342
lt's just a....

946
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:18,261
You know, l have enough money to buy...

947
01:13:18,387 --> 01:13:20,890
-Look.
-...as much lyonnaise potatoes...

948
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:23,894
-...as you ever would enjoy.
-Shut up, will you, please?

949
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:28,481
l think you ought to think about it a bit,
because it's nothing....

950
01:13:29,108 --> 01:13:30,984
Wait a minute.

951
01:13:32,027 --> 01:13:34,655
Thank you.

952
01:13:36,616 --> 01:13:37,658
Cover that.

953
01:13:41,413 --> 01:13:44,249
Hi. Could you give us a ride
to the next town?

954
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:46,210
-Sure. Jump in the back.
-Thanks a lot.

955
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:49,838
Great. See? For every shit,
there's six nice people.

956
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:54,343
-''Yahey,'' everyone.
-What's that?

957
01:13:54,677 --> 01:13:57,764
lt's ''Hello.'' l can say ''Hello''
in a lot of different languages.

958
01:13:57,889 --> 01:14:00,183
Not yours, but a lot of them.

959
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:07,775
Welcome, sir.

960
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:15,116
-l'm not lookin' forward to this.
-Do you think l am?

961
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,328
l don't understand the problem
with you two. He's an accountant.

962
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,248
lt's been bad luck. This guy Walsh is good.

963
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,543
lf he's that good,
l should hire him to hit you.

964
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,128
l hope there's no chance of this
coming back to Jimmy.

965
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,548
No chance.
Rented the chopper out of Kansas City.

966
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:31,384
He's five times removed from you.
You're clear of this.

967
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,596
Clear as shit, you moron!
The guy is still out there, ain't he?

968
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:36,265
Let me tell you guys somethin'.

969
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:39,185
l'm not interested in seein'
you two alive again...

970
01:14:39,185 --> 01:14:41,562
...until you get the accountant,
got the message?

971
01:14:58,164 --> 01:14:59,206
lt's the end of the ride.

972
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:01,084
-This is it?
-This is it.

973
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:04,337
ls there a real town
around here someplace?

974
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,173
-Channing.
-Channing?

975
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:08,800
How far is that from here?

976
01:15:08,925 --> 01:15:12,763
-Thirty miles.
-Thirty miles. Jesus Christ.

977
01:15:20,606 --> 01:15:23,108
What the hell kind of town is this?

978
01:15:34,454 --> 01:15:37,166
ls there someone that can give us
a ride to Channing?

979
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:40,919
-ls there anyone going in that direction?
-No, don't have a ride.

980
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:44,257
Excuse me a minute.
ls there a bathroom in there l could use?

981
01:15:44,382 --> 01:15:45,633
Yeah, go ahead.

982
01:15:46,634 --> 01:15:48,428
ls there a telephone here?

983
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:51,973
-Telephone.
-No telephone.

984
01:15:52,056 --> 01:15:53,851
No telephone? Nothing.

985
01:16:03,153 --> 01:16:05,321
Glad you're all havin' a good time.

986
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:32,768
Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?

987
01:16:32,852 --> 01:16:35,772
Get over here!
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

988
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:39,525
Get over here! Stop!

989
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:50,454
Fear of flyin', my ass!
Get out of that plane!

990
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,751
You're a goddamn pilot, you son of a bitch?

991
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,963
l didn't feel it was appropriate
to share that with you, Jack.

992
01:16:58,088 --> 01:17:01,634
l'm gonna appropriate your head.
How do you turn this thing off?

993
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:08,099
Turn it off!

994
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:11,144
Hang in there! l'm gonna let it down easy!

995
01:17:22,908 --> 01:17:24,242
Shit!

996
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:41,261
Pilot? You're a goddamn pilot?

997
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:43,973
You're a pilot? Here, l'll show you pilot.

998
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:47,851
l'll tell you about the coffee shop
l'm opening after l drop you off...

999
01:17:47,935 --> 01:17:49,937
...and get my $100,000. You'll love it.

1000
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:56,278
All right, get back!

1001
01:17:56,778 --> 01:17:58,154
Everybody, back!

1002
01:17:58,696 --> 01:18:01,700
-Give me the keys to the truck.
-You can't steal their truck.

1003
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:03,368
You were about to steal a plane!

1004
01:18:03,452 --> 01:18:06,289
-What are you talking about?
-l'm trying to save my life!

1005
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:08,582
l should give them something.
Give me your watch.

1006
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:10,877
My watch? Shit!

1007
01:18:11,294 --> 01:18:13,797
Keep it. lt's worth a lot of money.

1008
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,839
Get in.

1009
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:16,508
Stand back!

1010
01:18:16,633 --> 01:18:17,885
Get in.

1011
01:18:22,557 --> 01:18:24,433
Jack, let's be fair about this.

1012
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,102
You lied to me first.

1013
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:29,230
-At the river.
-What? Get the fuck--

1014
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,234
-At the river!
-You lied to me first.

1015
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:35,821
-You got some fuckin' nerve!
-No. You lied to me first.

1016
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:38,074
You lied to me first.

1017
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:45,498
Yes, l lied to you first but you had
no knowledge l was lying about my fear...

1018
01:18:45,707 --> 01:18:50,587
...at the river, when you lied to me.
So as far as you knew, you lied to me first.

1019
01:18:52,172 --> 01:18:54,675
Can't even argue with you.
Don't know what you're saying.

1020
01:18:54,884 --> 01:18:57,928
l'm just saying you lied to me first
as far as you knew.

1021
01:18:59,055 --> 01:19:00,932
-What's the matter?
-l got an ulcer.

1022
01:19:00,932 --> 01:19:02,517
-An ulcer?
-Yeah, l got an ulcer.

1023
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,938
l got a ulcer, and all your bullshit
started to make it bleed again.

1024
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:09,692
You know why you have an ulcer?
Because you have two forms of expression:

1025
01:19:09,901 --> 01:19:11,360
Silence and rage.

1026
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:17,534
Milk would coat it.

1027
01:19:17,617 --> 01:19:20,621
l need somethin' to eat, that's what l need.

1028
01:19:20,746 --> 01:19:22,956
What are we gonna buy it with? Dirt?

1029
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,960
You drive to the next town.
l'll take care of it.

1030
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,045
You'll take care of it? What do you mean?

1031
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:30,132
Drive to the next town.

1032
01:19:32,133 --> 01:19:33,885
But you lied to me first.

1033
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,191
-Now what?
-Give me that FBl badge.

1034
01:19:47,859 --> 01:19:51,405
-The FBl badge?
-Yeah, give me the FBl badge.

1035
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,336
-Uncuff me.
-Uncuff you?

1036
01:20:05,587 --> 01:20:07,881
Want to eat? Want a nice meal?

1037
01:20:08,173 --> 01:20:12,470
Want some of that shit you eat?
Come on. Uncuff me.

1038
01:20:19,769 --> 01:20:24,024
-You fuck with me--
-You'll hit me on the head and drop me....

1039
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:25,818
Right. Uncuff me.

1040
01:20:34,286 --> 01:20:36,454
-Who's in charge here?
-Who wants to know?

1041
01:20:36,538 --> 01:20:39,458
-Me.
-That'd be the manager.

1042
01:20:39,792 --> 01:20:41,877
l'd like to see the manager.

1043
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,545
Yes, sir.

1044
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:00,440
Alonzo Mosely, FBl.

1045
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,985
We're tracking a ring of counterfeiters...

1046
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:06,696
...passing phony $20 bills across the state.

1047
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:10,033
Have you received any $20 bills
in the last couple of hours?

1048
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,910
We get them all the time.

1049
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:19,627
You get them all the time. Would
you mind taking two steps backwards?

1050
01:21:21,838 --> 01:21:24,007
Would you mind opening the register?

1051
01:21:26,509 --> 01:21:28,178
No, don't touch them.

1052
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,472
Excuse me.

1053
01:21:31,515 --> 01:21:33,684
Contract two, Hank. Check them out.

1054
01:21:35,061 --> 01:21:36,937
Give him a pencil, please.

1055
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:45,489
Do the litmus configuration.

1056
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:49,243
Doing the litmus configuration?

1057
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:51,120
-Litmus configuration.
-Yes.

1058
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,463
You see any suspicious-looking characters
around here?

1059
01:21:59,546 --> 01:22:00,923
Nope.

1060
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:04,052
-Do you live around here?
-Yep.

1061
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,934
-How does it look?
-This one's bad.

1062
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,357
Describe exactly what the last man...

1063
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:19,067
...who passed a $20 bill to you looked like?

1064
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:21,362
-Thirty. Tall.
-About 6 feet tall?

1065
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:23,322
-6' 5''.
-Dark brown hair?

1066
01:22:23,656 --> 01:22:24,907
Light colored.

1067
01:22:25,534 --> 01:22:27,410
-Sounds like our man.
-That's him.

1068
01:22:27,619 --> 01:22:30,664
We're gonna take these bills for evidence.
Make them a receipt.

1069
01:22:30,748 --> 01:22:32,416
This one's bad, too.

1070
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:35,544
Please notify the other establishments
in the area.

1071
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:37,088
What's the name of yours?

1072
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:39,173
-Red's Corner Bar.
-Are you Red?

1073
01:22:40,758 --> 01:22:42,344
Do you dye your hair?

1074
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:43,261
No.

1075
01:22:43,678 --> 01:22:45,138
Why do they call you ''Red''?

1076
01:22:45,138 --> 01:22:47,933
lt's short for ''Red Wood.''
My last name's ''Wood.''

1077
01:22:48,475 --> 01:22:50,435
-What's your first name?
-Bill.

1078
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:55,566
Thank you for your cooperation.

1079
01:22:55,775 --> 01:22:57,110
Hank.

1080
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:01,531
These are all bad. Those are good.

1081
01:23:16,965 --> 01:23:19,134
-Come on. We're gonna get this train.
-What?

1082
01:23:19,343 --> 01:23:21,011
We're gonna catch this train.

1083
01:23:21,136 --> 01:23:22,679
l can't catch a train.

1084
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:24,640
You also couldn't fly. Start running.

1085
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:27,476
Wait a minute. Wait! lt's a freight train!

1086
01:23:28,519 --> 01:23:30,480
l can't do this!

1087
01:23:40,908 --> 01:23:43,119
l deeply feel l can't do this.

1088
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:46,248
l thought you liked to travel by train.
Get up there!

1089
01:23:52,588 --> 01:23:54,798
-What are you doing?
-Promise to let me go?

1090
01:23:54,923 --> 01:23:58,010
-Open the fuckin' door!
-See you in the next life, Jack.

1091
01:23:58,427 --> 01:24:00,221
Son of a bitch!

1092
01:24:00,429 --> 01:24:03,016
You son of a bitch! Open that fuckin' door!

1093
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,783
Glad to see me?

1094
01:24:19,409 --> 01:24:21,619
l guess we're in the next life.

1095
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:24,123
-Don't overreact now.
-Don't overreact?

1096
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:26,291
l won't overreact! Get over here!

1097
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,046
React? You do this again,
l'll throw you off the fuckin' train!

1098
01:24:32,966 --> 01:24:34,968
Get down there! Put your hand in there!

1099
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:36,803
-Easy, Jack.
-There.

1100
01:24:37,345 --> 01:24:39,014
You son of a bitch!

1101
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:47,064
You shut up! l'm not talking to you
for the whole rest of this trip!

1102
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:53,404
Are you gonna let me go, or what?
l don't know anything.

1103
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:54,740
ls that a fact?

1104
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:57,075
Shit.

1105
01:25:05,168 --> 01:25:07,796
Why don't you quit?
Be cheaper for both of us.

1106
01:25:15,013 --> 01:25:16,264
Where are they?

1107
01:25:16,347 --> 01:25:17,598
You got me.

1108
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:20,310
-lnspector.
-Shut up.

1109
01:25:20,435 --> 01:25:22,395
Now you listen, you son of a bitch.

1110
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,272
l want answers, right now.

1111
01:25:24,355 --> 01:25:27,192
What do you want from me?
l don't know nothin'.

1112
01:25:33,449 --> 01:25:37,412
lt seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely
and his partner...

1113
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:41,040
...were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near Channing.

1114
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:45,129
Come on.

1115
01:26:02,022 --> 01:26:03,691
Jack? What?

1116
01:26:06,736 --> 01:26:10,782
How much further you think we have
to go? None of your fuckin' business!

1117
01:26:10,782 --> 01:26:13,076
l'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

1118
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:14,662
Shut the fuck up!

1119
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:23,421
Did you ever have sex with an animal?

1120
01:26:26,925 --> 01:26:29,970
Remember those chickens
around the lndian reservation?

1121
01:26:30,095 --> 01:26:33,932
There's some good-lookin' chickens there.
You know, between us.

1122
01:26:34,141 --> 01:26:37,270
There were a couple there
l might have taken a shot at.

1123
01:26:41,233 --> 01:26:43,318
What's with you and that watch?

1124
01:26:43,443 --> 01:26:45,404
You said when you got to know me better.

1125
01:26:45,529 --> 01:26:47,698
You told me about your feelings
for chickens.

1126
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:51,035
How private could the watch be?
What's the big secret?

1127
01:26:55,623 --> 01:26:58,126
Gail bought me this watch.
She gave it to me.

1128
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,420
lt was the first thing she ever gave me.

1129
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:10,306
She bought it because l was always late
by at least a half an hour.

1130
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:15,228
So she bought it and set it ahead
a half an hour so l'd never be late.

1131
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:27,408
ln the back of my mind
l keep thinking we'll wind up together.

1132
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:30,870
l don't know why l'm still hanging on.
l'm still waitin' around.

1133
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,961
l don't think she's comin' back.

1134
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,133
Yeah, l don't either.

1135
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,344
l don't either.

1136
01:27:46,513 --> 01:27:48,807
Sometimes you just have to let go.

1137
01:27:51,852 --> 01:27:53,812
Just get yourself a new watch.

1138
01:28:01,112 --> 01:28:03,198
You're okay, Jack.

1139
01:28:05,701 --> 01:28:07,161
l think...

1140
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:10,080
...under different circumstances...

1141
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,792
...you and l...

1142
01:28:14,043 --> 01:28:16,630
...probably still would've hated each other.

1143
01:28:21,135 --> 01:28:23,303
We probably could've been friends.

1144
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:27,183
ln the next life.

1145
01:28:28,226 --> 01:28:30,102
Yeah, the next life.

1146
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:36,986
Yeah, great.

1147
01:28:37,486 --> 01:28:39,571
Accommodations were wonderful.

1148
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:43,159
-You got a smoke?
-Don't smoke.

1149
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:46,078
That fed took my cigarettes.

1150
01:28:46,162 --> 01:28:48,165
You want your cigarettes back?

1151
01:28:48,248 --> 01:28:50,417
Then you'll have to go to Flagstaff...

1152
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:53,254
...'cause that's where
your pal Mosely went.

1153
01:28:56,256 --> 01:28:57,926
Just might do that.

1154
01:29:04,015 --> 01:29:05,767
Where do you figure we are?

1155
01:29:06,393 --> 01:29:09,438
My guess would be Arizona.
We've been goin' west all night.

1156
01:29:09,522 --> 01:29:11,273
l think we're almost home.

1157
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:16,112
l'm almost dead.

1158
01:29:22,661 --> 01:29:26,290
The Witness Protection Program
isn't so bad.

1159
01:29:26,832 --> 01:29:29,126
You'll get a new name.
You'll have a new life.

1160
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:31,838
l won't make it
to any witness protection program.

1161
01:29:31,963 --> 01:29:34,215
-You don't know that.
-l know it. You know it.

1162
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:37,969
Serrano will get to me before l get
to a Witness Protection Program.

1163
01:29:38,511 --> 01:29:39,763
Do me a favor.

1164
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:43,392
Don't pretend you care about me.
lt really insults my intelligence.

1165
01:29:43,517 --> 01:29:47,146
Let's face it. The only important thing
about me to you...

1166
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:48,940
...is gettin' your money.

1167
01:29:49,232 --> 01:29:52,152
l'm really tired of you makin' me out
to be a thug...

1168
01:29:52,277 --> 01:29:54,571
...whose only concern
is a big chunk of change.

1169
01:29:54,779 --> 01:29:57,491
You know Serrano's people
offered me $1,000,000 for you?

1170
01:29:57,491 --> 01:30:00,327
Why not go for the big money?
You're working for him anyway.

1171
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:03,539
l'm workin' for him anyway?
You don't know what you're saying.

1172
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:08,545
The reason l do this shit in the first place
is 'cause l wouldn't work for that asshole.

1173
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:12,090
-What does that mean?
-Nothin'.

1174
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:13,842
Doesn't mean anything.

1175
01:30:18,139 --> 01:30:21,893
Serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in Chicago?

1176
01:30:24,813 --> 01:30:28,567
Who owned your buddies
and destroyed your life? That's Serrano?

1177
01:30:31,278 --> 01:30:33,865
That's the guy that you're takin' me in....

1178
01:30:34,532 --> 01:30:36,784
That's the guy that's gonna kill me?

1179
01:30:41,373 --> 01:30:44,000
Hope it's a wonderful coffee shop, Jack.

1180
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:04,648
-Come on. We're gettin' off.
-What?

1181
01:31:04,982 --> 01:31:07,985
We are getting off here, Mr. Railroad Man.
Come on.

1182
01:31:08,903 --> 01:31:11,656
-You should be good at this.
-What are you talkin' about?

1183
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,991
Let's discuss this!

1184
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:26,255
-Find anything?
-Not yet.

1185
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:29,884
They could've jumped off the train
anywhere along the line.

1186
01:31:37,602 --> 01:31:39,604
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.

1187
01:31:39,687 --> 01:31:44,067
The reason is people plan to get off
the trains when they stop.

1188
01:31:44,484 --> 01:31:49,281
That's how, generally, people do it.
They don't throw each other off the trains.

1189
01:31:49,281 --> 01:31:52,618
That's the purpose of having stops.

1190
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:54,787
What's this?

1191
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:57,623
What are you gonna do?
What are you doin' now?

1192
01:31:59,084 --> 01:32:01,378
What are you doin'?

1193
01:32:06,383 --> 01:32:08,886
Christ! Come on!

1194
01:32:08,969 --> 01:32:13,057
Are you kidding? They're gonna come out
and shoot us, for Christ's sake.

1195
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:14,726
What the hell?

1196
01:32:17,229 --> 01:32:19,105
Jesus. Great!

1197
01:32:23,068 --> 01:32:24,946
You get it started...

1198
01:32:26,406 --> 01:32:29,951
...and l'll run you over.
That's the best plan l can think of.

1199
01:32:33,288 --> 01:32:36,000
Congratulations. Another crime.

1200
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:37,876
Come on.

1201
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:41,422
l don't like this.

1202
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:44,967
l don't like anything you do,
to tell you the truth. Nothin'.

1203
01:32:56,355 --> 01:32:57,774
Where are we going?

1204
01:32:58,107 --> 01:32:59,776
To the nearest airport.

1205
01:33:07,493 --> 01:33:10,621
l'm not the kind of guy that says,
''l told you so,'' but....

1206
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:15,626
Shit!

1207
01:33:17,712 --> 01:33:21,258
They've been spotted 35 miles south
of here near Sedona.

1208
01:33:21,383 --> 01:33:23,344
There are officers in pursuit.

1209
01:33:24,053 --> 01:33:25,638
Let's take the chopper.

1210
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,071
This is the kind of situation
where something bad happens.

1211
01:33:44,826 --> 01:33:45,660
Easy!

1212
01:33:48,579 --> 01:33:50,749
Goddamn it, l don't like this!

1213
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:11,730
Truck!

1214
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:54,403
-Where are you goin'?
-You'll find out when we get there.

1215
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,876
l've come too far.

1216
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:11,088
Too far.

1217
01:35:12,005 --> 01:35:13,882
l'm too close.

1218
01:36:09,986 --> 01:36:12,572
Okay. l'm coming. All right.

1219
01:36:15,617 --> 01:36:17,160
-Come on.
-All right.

1220
01:36:27,505 --> 01:36:28,965
Here we go.

1221
01:36:29,508 --> 01:36:30,759
Hello!

1222
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:38,142
Am l lucky, or am l just good?

1223
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:39,811
ls that Marvin?

1224
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:42,730
Fucking A. l'm the best.

1225
01:36:44,273 --> 01:36:47,319
Hello, Jack, you dumb shit.

1226
01:36:55,662 --> 01:36:58,164
-Come on, you pain in the ass!
-What was that?

1227
01:36:58,289 --> 01:36:59,540
Wait a minute.

1228
01:37:02,044 --> 01:37:04,713
lf you move, l'll tear your fuckin' lungs out!

1229
01:37:07,341 --> 01:37:08,592
See you in LA.

1230
01:37:34,454 --> 01:37:36,831
Shit.

1231
01:37:54,185 --> 01:37:56,020
Afternoon, sir.

1232
01:37:57,938 --> 01:38:00,733
-You open?
-We're always open.

1233
01:38:03,653 --> 01:38:05,322
Hard day?

1234
01:38:05,864 --> 01:38:07,199
Hard week.

1235
01:38:07,699 --> 01:38:09,492
Yeah, l know what you mean.

1236
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:12,538
l could use a cup of coffee.

1237
01:38:29,723 --> 01:38:31,392
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1238
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:35,897
Keep it.

1239
01:38:51,831 --> 01:38:53,917
l been lookin' all over for these.

1240
01:38:54,668 --> 01:38:55,794
Thanks, Alonzo.

1241
01:39:01,633 --> 01:39:06,014
Marvin, l have to tell you,
l have this very serious fear of flying.

1242
01:39:07,682 --> 01:39:10,394
Why don't you just relax
and sleep through it?

1243
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:17,192
Forget your deadline.
That's the way that one went.

1244
01:39:17,276 --> 01:39:19,696
l know my rights.
You owe me phone calls.

1245
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:22,615
What should be important
to you is not the phone calls...

1246
01:39:22,698 --> 01:39:26,119
...but that you'll spend 10 years
for impersonating a federal agent.

1247
01:39:26,244 --> 01:39:28,121
-10 years?
-10 years.

1248
01:39:28,205 --> 01:39:30,708
10 years. How come no one's after you?

1249
01:39:40,636 --> 01:39:42,220
Give this guy his calls.

1250
01:39:42,304 --> 01:39:43,763
Thanks.

1251
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,101
Can l have a little privacy, please?

1252
01:39:59,739 --> 01:40:01,282
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

1253
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,077
lt's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on.

1254
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,203
lt's Jack.

1255
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,917
Yeah. This better be good news,
because you got five hours left.

1256
01:40:10,043 --> 01:40:14,089
No, it's not. l'm callin' to let you know
that you're dead. You understand me?

1257
01:40:14,214 --> 01:40:15,590
Wait a minute.

1258
01:40:15,757 --> 01:40:18,260
You put Marvin on this case,
you piece of shit.

1259
01:40:18,386 --> 01:40:21,180
You're fucking deceptive. You vermin!
You serpent!

1260
01:40:21,305 --> 01:40:25,184
-Are you fuckin' done yet?
-You slime ball in a sea of pus! What?

1261
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:27,145
You blew it, all right?

1262
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:30,273
You had the guy four fuckin' days, Jack.
Four days!

1263
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:35,070
You could've fuckin' walked him backwards
and not fuckin' blown it, but you blew it.

1264
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:39,242
When have l ever let you down,
you fuckin' rat?

1265
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:42,995
Are you fuckin' nuts,
tellin' Dorfler l offered you $100,000...

1266
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,374
...when l told him l'd give him $25,000?

1267
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:47,876
-When did you speak to him?
-Why?

1268
01:40:48,001 --> 01:40:49,127
When did you speak to him?

1269
01:40:49,253 --> 01:40:51,547
He called me 10 minutes ago...

1270
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:54,049
...yellin' and screamin',
tellin' me to fuck off.

1271
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:56,761
You're tellin' me,
everybody's tellin' me to fuck off.

1272
01:40:56,761 --> 01:40:59,680
Am l supposed tojust sit
on my fuckin' butt?

1273
01:41:00,307 --> 01:41:01,641
What are you talkin' about?

1274
01:41:01,767 --> 01:41:05,521
Look, you got five hours left.
Can you bring the Duke in, yes or no?

1275
01:41:05,521 --> 01:41:07,314
l thought he's bringin' him to you.

1276
01:41:07,398 --> 01:41:10,317
l just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.
He don't have the Duke.

1277
01:41:10,401 --> 01:41:12,403
-What?
-Where's the fuckin' Duke?

1278
01:41:13,654 --> 01:41:15,406
-Hello?
-l'll talk to you later.

1279
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:53,282
-Hello?
-Yeah, Tony Darvo there, please?

1280
01:41:53,366 --> 01:41:55,576
-Who's calling?
-Marvin Dorfler.

1281
01:42:00,456 --> 01:42:02,959
Marvin Dorfler on the line.
Shall l put him through?

1282
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:04,753
Yeah. Put him through.

1283
01:42:07,047 --> 01:42:08,506
Everything's still on schedule?

1284
01:42:08,632 --> 01:42:10,718
So Dorfler's workin' for you guys.

1285
01:42:10,801 --> 01:42:12,886
-Who is this?
-This is Jack Walsh.

1286
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:16,849
Jack, what are you complainin' for?
We came to you first, didn't we?

1287
01:42:16,975 --> 01:42:20,187
lt's Jack Walsh.
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.

1288
01:42:22,814 --> 01:42:24,232
Too late for you, scumbag.

1289
01:42:24,357 --> 01:42:27,486
Too late for you. l didn't come this far
not to get my money.

1290
01:42:27,486 --> 01:42:30,406
You understand me, you motherfuckers?
l want the Duke back.

1291
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:31,866
What are you tellin' me for?

1292
01:42:31,991 --> 01:42:34,368
What am l tellin' you for?

1293
01:42:35,077 --> 01:42:36,872
l'll tell you what l'm tellin' you for.

1294
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,374
l got some of the Duke's belongings.
That's why.

1295
01:42:39,499 --> 01:42:42,294
lncluding some computer disks
that have every detail...

1296
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:46,466
...of Serrano's businesses
and his money-laundering operations.

1297
01:42:46,591 --> 01:42:49,385
And if l don't get the Duke back
in the next two hours...

1298
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:52,597
...l'm gonna turn the disks over
to the feds. Hear me?

1299
01:42:52,723 --> 01:42:57,103
Tell Serrano l'll meet him with the Duke
in two hours in McCarran Airport...

1300
01:42:57,186 --> 01:42:58,562
...where we'll make the exchange.

1301
01:42:58,687 --> 01:43:01,690
He's the only one of you
who won't try to shoot me in public.

1302
01:43:01,774 --> 01:43:04,944
lf l see one fuckin' single goon
within a mile of that airport...

1303
01:43:05,236 --> 01:43:06,904
...now listen to me...

1304
01:43:06,904 --> 01:43:08,991
...the deal's off, and l'll go to the feds.

1305
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:11,284
l won't bother Jimmy with your bullshit.

1306
01:43:11,368 --> 01:43:14,121
You're not? Okay, fine. Fine.
After he's busted...

1307
01:43:14,205 --> 01:43:16,707
...l'll tell him
you knew all about it beforehand.

1308
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:20,378
That's two hours from now.
Main terminal, McCarran Airport.

1309
01:43:20,545 --> 01:43:22,964
You got that, moron? Have a nice day.

1310
01:43:29,722 --> 01:43:31,724
Tell Alonzo l want to make a deal.

1311
01:43:46,532 --> 01:43:47,992
You want to make a deal with me?

1312
01:43:48,075 --> 01:43:50,286
What if l could deliver you Serrano?

1313
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:53,831
What do you mean, ''deliver''?

1314
01:43:53,915 --> 01:43:56,752
For starters, conspiracy to destroy
government evidence.

1315
01:43:56,835 --> 01:43:58,336
What government evidence?

1316
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:01,132
Will you let me take the Duke back
and collect my money?

1317
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:11,852
Tell me more.

1318
01:44:11,977 --> 01:44:14,896
Tell you on the way 'cause we gotta be
in Las Vegas in two hours.

1319
01:44:36,045 --> 01:44:37,714
No, it's room service.

1320
01:44:48,684 --> 01:44:50,227
Here. Hold this up...

1321
01:44:50,769 --> 01:44:52,855
...so they know l took this today.

1322
01:44:53,898 --> 01:44:56,484
l amaze myself. l'm always thinking.

1323
01:44:58,069 --> 01:44:59,738
Got it all figured out.

1324
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:03,158
-Now say, ''Cheese.''
-Don't do this, Marvin.

1325
01:45:05,995 --> 01:45:07,454
Adios.

1326
01:45:10,166 --> 01:45:12,752
All right.
There are no real computer disks.

1327
01:45:12,877 --> 01:45:14,545
-ls that right?
-Right.

1328
01:45:14,755 --> 01:45:16,340
So if you give him blank disks...

1329
01:45:16,423 --> 01:45:19,759
...and he accepts them
would that still be considered an overt act?

1330
01:45:19,843 --> 01:45:23,013
lf he just enters the airport,
he's committed an overt act...

1331
01:45:23,097 --> 01:45:24,848
...conspiracy to obstruct justice.

1332
01:45:24,973 --> 01:45:27,352
When he shows up with the Duke,
you add kidnapping.

1333
01:45:27,477 --> 01:45:29,771
Anybody with a gun,
conspiracy to commit murder.

1334
01:45:29,854 --> 01:45:34,025
The fact that it's an airport,
correct me if you think l'm wrong....

1335
01:45:34,151 --> 01:45:38,197
...you can slap an interstate transportation
aid of racketeering rap on him.

1336
01:45:39,573 --> 01:45:43,453
None of that means anything
unless you can get him to take those disks.

1337
01:45:43,536 --> 01:45:46,247
Don't worry. l'll get him to take the disks.

1338
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,125
Get a wire on this man.

1339
01:46:02,223 --> 01:46:05,727
No hard feelings about
what happened back in Amarillo?

1340
01:46:09,732 --> 01:46:13,153
Just one of
those spur-of-the-moment deals.

1341
01:46:13,486 --> 01:46:15,989
-Where is he?
-Where's the money?

1342
01:46:16,406 --> 01:46:18,074
ln the car. Where is he?

1343
01:46:21,286 --> 01:46:24,832
Slight change of plans.
Now l want $2 million.

1344
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:25,750
What?

1345
01:46:25,875 --> 01:46:29,629
l read the newspapers, you know?
The guy got you for $15 million, right?

1346
01:46:29,754 --> 01:46:32,340
So l figure he's gotta be worth
at least $2 million.

1347
01:46:33,674 --> 01:46:35,344
l'm a businessman.

1348
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,805
How do we know you got him?

1349
01:46:46,523 --> 01:46:48,191
l want $1 million now...

1350
01:46:48,816 --> 01:46:50,777
...and l'll call you in 20 minutes...

1351
01:46:50,903 --> 01:46:53,697
...tell you where to drop off
the second million.

1352
01:46:53,822 --> 01:46:56,951
Once l know it's there,
then l'll tell you where he is.

1353
01:47:00,704 --> 01:47:02,874
-Not okay.
-Why not?

1354
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:10,298
What are you, nuts? What will Jimmy say?

1355
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:11,968
How will we get the Duke now?

1356
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:15,721
-You got the answer right in your hand!
-What are you talkin' about?

1357
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:18,141
When are you gonna learn
how to pay attention?

1358
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:21,769
See what it says there?

1359
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:29,820
All right. This is it.
Tonight is the night. You understand?

1360
01:47:29,987 --> 01:47:31,905
l'm sick of all of these screw-ups.

1361
01:47:31,989 --> 01:47:34,284
As soon as l get the disks from Walsh...

1362
01:47:34,492 --> 01:47:37,829
...you guys drop Walsh
and you drop the Duke. You understand?

1363
01:47:37,913 --> 01:47:40,832
l get the disks, you drop them. Okay?

1364
01:47:41,374 --> 01:47:43,878
-l don't think you should do this.
-Really?

1365
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,838
What do you propose that l do?

1366
01:47:45,963 --> 01:47:48,173
Send somebody with a cash offer.
Don't do this.

1367
01:47:48,675 --> 01:47:50,760
l know Walsh.
He won't take any money from me.

1368
01:47:50,969 --> 01:47:54,014
He's a very self-righteous type of guy.
lt aggravates me.

1369
01:47:54,097 --> 01:47:57,517
ln his mind, this is clean.
He gets what he wants, l get what l want.

1370
01:47:57,642 --> 01:47:59,937
The guy's a fuckin' burnout, Sidney.

1371
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:04,191
Sit down, relax, have a sandwich,
drink a glass of milk. Do something.

1372
01:48:22,253 --> 01:48:23,630
He's on his way.

1373
01:48:37,812 --> 01:48:39,772
He's heading north
on Las Vegas Boulevard...

1374
01:48:39,897 --> 01:48:42,985
...approximately two miles
from the airport. We're right on him.

1375
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:44,653
Why are you smiling?

1376
01:48:45,612 --> 01:48:47,490
l feel like a cop again.

1377
01:49:40,465 --> 01:49:43,176
So l'm finally in the presence of greatness?

1378
01:49:43,885 --> 01:49:45,053
The Duke.

1379
01:49:46,305 --> 01:49:48,390
The guy that steals money from scum...

1380
01:49:48,598 --> 01:49:51,310
...and gives it to the unfortunates
of the world.

1381
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:53,479
l wanted to meet you face to face.

1382
01:49:59,569 --> 01:50:04,658
Did you actually think you could steal
my money and get away with it?

1383
01:50:06,536 --> 01:50:09,038
l stopped by here to tell you two things:

1384
01:50:09,872 --> 01:50:12,375
Number one is: You're gonna die tonight.

1385
01:50:13,209 --> 01:50:17,923
Number two: l'm gonna go home,
have a nice hot meal...

1386
01:50:19,341 --> 01:50:23,220
...l'm gonna find your wife,
and l'm gonna kill her, too.

1387
01:50:32,397 --> 01:50:34,900
Wait here for my call.
The rest of you go in.

1388
01:50:35,025 --> 01:50:36,276
You got it.

1389
01:50:53,044 --> 01:50:54,212
Here he comes.

1390
01:51:06,393 --> 01:51:07,853
Long time no see.

1391
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,729
Long time no see.

1392
01:51:09,938 --> 01:51:12,441
You're still spendin'
all your money on clothes.

1393
01:51:12,566 --> 01:51:15,361
-You know....
-Listen, while you're in town...

1394
01:51:15,779 --> 01:51:19,115
...ifyou want to see a show
or you want a free meal or something...

1395
01:51:19,115 --> 01:51:21,076
...just let me know, all right? On me.

1396
01:51:21,201 --> 01:51:22,661
That's the kind of guy l am.

1397
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:24,246
You're a real sport.

1398
01:51:24,538 --> 01:51:26,499
Just give him the disks.

1399
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:28,417
How's your mother?

1400
01:51:30,085 --> 01:51:31,420
She's all right.

1401
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:33,715
Daughter's gettin' big, growing up.

1402
01:51:38,595 --> 01:51:42,183
l was thinkin' if we would've done business
way back when...

1403
01:51:42,266 --> 01:51:45,394
...you wouldn't look like a guy
with a cup in your hand.

1404
01:51:46,437 --> 01:51:48,314
l'm tryin' to make a living.

1405
01:51:48,523 --> 01:51:52,693
You got those disks or did you lose them
like you lost your job?

1406
01:51:56,656 --> 01:51:58,534
Give him the disks, Walsh.

1407
01:51:59,785 --> 01:52:01,871
l see you, but l don't see the Duke.

1408
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:05,834
-We'll worry about him in a minute.
-We gotta worry about him now.

1409
01:52:07,919 --> 01:52:11,048
Let me tell you somethin', Jimmy.
This isn't a reunion.

1410
01:52:11,381 --> 01:52:15,428
lf l don't see the Duke
in about five seconds, l'm walking.

1411
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:18,889
You know, you're still way too serious.

1412
01:52:19,056 --> 01:52:22,101
Really. Listen.
Why don't you just hand them over?

1413
01:52:22,101 --> 01:52:23,645
We'll go get the guy together.

1414
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,856
l'll see you at the arraignment.

1415
01:52:28,066 --> 01:52:29,734
Where the hell is he goin'?

1416
01:52:29,818 --> 01:52:31,153
You win, all right?

1417
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:32,113
-l what?
-You won.

1418
01:52:32,238 --> 01:52:34,907
You want me to yell it all over the airport?

1419
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:37,952
Where is he?

1420
01:52:41,832 --> 01:52:44,626
-He's on his way.
-You know l said no goons.

1421
01:52:44,751 --> 01:52:47,672
Never mind him.
You're gonna get what you want.

1422
01:52:48,589 --> 01:52:52,343
This thing is gonna give me a heart attack
before it's all over.

1423
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:09,028
Since we have this moment together
there's something l want to ask you.

1424
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:17,162
Doesn't it bother you that another copper
is fuckin' your wife?

1425
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:22,042
Do you know
they made this guy a captain?

1426
01:53:23,211 --> 01:53:26,881
Can you imagine that?
Go figure it out. Made him a captain.

1427
01:53:34,807 --> 01:53:37,893
-Can l help you, sir?
-Give me a one-way ticket to LA.

1428
01:53:38,018 --> 01:53:39,979
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.

1429
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:43,858
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?

1430
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,819
Take a wild guess.

1431
01:53:46,987 --> 01:53:48,572
Smoking.

1432
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,587
And how will you be paying for this, sir?

1433
01:54:10,262 --> 01:54:11,389
-Shit.
-What?

1434
01:54:11,514 --> 01:54:12,432
Look.

1435
01:54:19,314 --> 01:54:20,982
What the hell is he doing here?

1436
01:54:20,982 --> 01:54:23,486
We have a male Caucasian
with a green duffel bag...

1437
01:54:23,611 --> 01:54:26,113
...with his hand in his vest,
approaching the subjects.

1438
01:54:26,196 --> 01:54:29,200
Get him out of there as quickly
and as quietly as possible.

1439
01:54:29,325 --> 01:54:32,246
Shoot him if you have to,
but get him out of here.

1440
01:54:34,122 --> 01:54:35,374
-You okay, Jon?
-Yeah.

1441
01:54:35,582 --> 01:54:38,294
-Stand behind me.
-lt's all right.

1442
01:54:39,962 --> 01:54:41,005
Come on.

1443
01:54:43,383 --> 01:54:45,718
-How's everybody doin'?
-Get out of here?

1444
01:54:45,802 --> 01:54:47,261
Back off, everybody.

1445
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:50,057
-Who are you?
-Are you writin' a book? Who are you?

1446
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:51,850
Who is he?

1447
01:54:52,559 --> 01:54:55,396
You're missin' the bigger picture here.
Get out of here.

1448
01:54:56,439 --> 01:54:57,898
Wire's gone dead.

1449
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:01,569
-Are you crazy?
-l didn't come all this way for nothin'.

1450
01:55:03,404 --> 01:55:04,990
-Serrano's leaving.
-Did he take the disks?

1451
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:06,158
l don't know.

1452
01:55:07,075 --> 01:55:09,077
-Serrano's got the disks.
-Let him go.

1453
01:55:09,162 --> 01:55:10,329
He got the disks.

1454
01:55:11,455 --> 01:55:12,915
Did he take the disks?

1455
01:55:12,915 --> 01:55:15,001
l couldn't tell. There's too much goin' on.

1456
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:20,090
Serrano's got the disks. He's got the disks.

1457
01:55:22,426 --> 01:55:24,177
Marvin, look out!

1458
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:28,015
l'm not fallin' for that again.

1459
01:55:29,391 --> 01:55:31,603
You stupid fuck, will you look out!

1460
01:55:31,895 --> 01:55:34,522
Serrano's got the disks!

1461
01:55:34,689 --> 01:55:35,523
Move in.

1462
01:55:45,117 --> 01:55:47,329
Take it easy! Come on!

1463
01:55:48,788 --> 01:55:51,290
Goddamn it! Who the fuck are you guys?

1464
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:00,051
There's somethin' l've been wanting to say
for ten years.

1465
01:56:00,134 --> 01:56:02,637
-What's that?
-''You're under arrest.''

1466
01:56:03,805 --> 01:56:05,807
We'll catch up to each other
one of these days.

1467
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:07,768
Maybe we will.

1468
01:56:09,144 --> 01:56:11,396
-We still got our deal?
-We got our deal.

1469
01:56:11,521 --> 01:56:15,067
Wait a minute! What deal?
Why does he get special treatment?

1470
01:56:15,276 --> 01:56:16,819
See you in LA, Marvin.

1471
01:56:16,944 --> 01:56:19,155
Watch your cigarettes with this guy.

1472
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:21,950
What's goin' on?

1473
01:56:22,075 --> 01:56:24,995
Sorry. l got an hour and a half
to get you back to LA.

1474
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:26,413
Thanks, Alonzo.

1475
01:58:10,403 --> 01:58:11,946
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

1476
01:58:12,197 --> 01:58:14,574
Hello, Eddie. Where's Jerry?

1477
01:58:14,699 --> 01:58:16,952
Never mind Jerry. Where the hell are you?

1478
01:58:17,077 --> 01:58:19,037
Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago.

1479
01:58:19,162 --> 01:58:21,249
-What for?
-What's the difference, man?

1480
01:58:21,249 --> 01:58:23,125
l never trusted that guy anyway.

1481
01:58:23,209 --> 01:58:26,379
-Where the hell are you?
-Where am l? l'm at the airport.

1482
01:58:26,463 --> 01:58:28,756
And guess who l'm with?
l'm with the Duke.

1483
01:58:28,756 --> 01:58:32,511
You got him! l love you!

1484
01:58:32,803 --> 01:58:35,555
-You want to say hello?
-Yeah. Put him on.

1485
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:37,225
-Say hello.
-Hello.

1486
01:58:37,308 --> 01:58:39,477
Hello, you son of a bitch!

1487
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:40,728
We got you...

1488
01:58:40,853 --> 01:58:42,522
...you son of a bitch!

1489
01:58:42,647 --> 01:58:46,067
Now say good-bye, you lying piece of shit,
'cause l'm letting him go.

1490
01:58:54,201 --> 01:58:56,287
Would've been a nice coffee shop.

1491
01:58:58,915 --> 01:59:00,333
Jesus.

1492
01:59:03,796 --> 01:59:05,047
l don't get it.

1493
01:59:06,089 --> 01:59:09,844
l did what l wanted to do.
l got you to LA before midnight, so....

1494
01:59:18,186 --> 01:59:19,855
l don't know what to say.

1495
01:59:20,481 --> 01:59:21,732
Don't say anything.

1496
01:59:21,857 --> 01:59:24,944
Knowing you, you'll make me want
to put those back on you again.

1497
01:59:26,529 --> 01:59:27,571
Thanks.

1498
01:59:27,571 --> 01:59:30,283
-No. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1499
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,959
Somethin' to remember our adventure by.

1500
01:59:53,016 --> 01:59:54,476
This better be good.

1501
01:59:56,354 --> 01:59:57,730
This is good.

1502
01:59:59,065 --> 02:00:00,941
This is very good.

1503
02:00:05,738 --> 02:00:09,409
When l was makin' my getaway,
l thought the FBl was closin' in on me.

1504
02:00:09,493 --> 02:00:12,747
Take it. l took some traveling money.

1505
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:13,873
Take it.

1506
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:20,547
lt's not a payoff. lt's a gift.
You already let me go.

1507
02:00:22,925 --> 02:00:24,593
You son of a bitch.

1508
02:00:25,552 --> 02:00:28,055
-You son of a bitch.
-Told you l had money.

1509
02:00:28,473 --> 02:00:31,600
l know you had money,
but l didn't know you had money.

1510
02:00:40,694 --> 02:00:42,029
How much is here?

1511
02:00:42,529 --> 02:00:44,198
Neighborhood of $300,000.

1512
02:00:47,535 --> 02:00:50,872
That's a very respectable neighborhood.

1513
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:58,297
l don't know what to say.

1514
02:00:59,966 --> 02:01:01,634
Take care.

1515
02:01:03,719 --> 02:01:06,556
-Take care.
-See you in the next life.

1516
02:01:07,265 --> 02:01:10,185
-See you in the next life.
