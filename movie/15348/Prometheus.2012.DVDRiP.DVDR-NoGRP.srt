1
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:19,016
Get Charlie.

2
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,154
Dr. Holloway!

3
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,296
Charlie!

4
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:44,938
What?

5
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:46,714
Come quick!

6
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,138
-Did you date it?
-Thirty-five thousand...

7
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,958
...years. Maybe older.

8
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:44,797
You gotta be kidding me.

9
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,634
lt's the same configuration.

10
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,613
l mean, it's gotta predate
the others by millennia.

11
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:10,017
l think they want us
to come and find them.

12
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:13,657
Yeah.

13
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,336
What happened to that man?

14
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:20,537
He died.

15
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,295
Why aren't you helping them?

16
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,180
They don't want my help.

17
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:27,821
Their God is different than ours.

18
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:31,415
Why did he die?

19
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,133
Because sooner or later, everyone does.

20
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:35,496
Like Mummy?

21
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:38,616
Like Mummy.

22
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,860
Where do they go?

23
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:45,333
Everyone has their own word.

24
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:46,697
Heaven.

25
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:48,138
Paradise.

26
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:52,097
Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.

27
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:53,854
How do you know it's beautiful?

28
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,255
That's what l choose to believe.

29
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:59,140
What do you believe, Ellie?

30
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,820
Good morning, David.

31
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:36,261
Transmitting message.

32
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:41,094
No response.

33
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,821
Whilst this articulation...

34
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,621
...is attested in
the lndo-European descendants...

35
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,579
...as a purely paralinguistic form...

36
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:59,700
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form
dating back...

37
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,739
...five millennia or more.

38
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:03,815
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.

39
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,052
Repeat after me.

40
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:18,971
Perfect.

41
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,737
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes?

42
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,053
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

43
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,336
You do that once too often.
lt's only flesh and blood!

44
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:36,451
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

45
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:38,210
And you're barmy.

46
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,737
-lt damn well hurts!
-Certainly, it hurts.

47
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,255
Well, what's the trick, then?

48
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:52,060
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

49
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:55,653
The trick, William Potter...

50
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,780
...is not minding that it hurts.

51
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,980
The trick, William Potter...

52
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,898
...is not minding that it hurts.

53
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,574
Attention:

54
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,095
Destination threshold.

55
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:28,537
Attention:

56
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:30,613
Destination threshold.

57
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:33,451
Attention: Destination threshold.

58
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:34,211
Robe.

59
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,450
How long?

60
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:48,897
Two years, four months, 18 days...

61
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,211
...36 hours, 15 minutes.

62
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,736
Any casualties?

63
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,331
Casualties, ma'am?

64
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:54,537
Has anyone died?

65
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,893
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.

66
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,381
Well, then wake them up.

67
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:13,059
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.

68
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:15,735
My name is David.

69
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,337
Your mind and body
are in a state of shock...

70
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,493
...as a result of the stasis.

71
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,539
lt's all right. Perfectly normal.

72
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:24,458
Ellie.

73
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,021
We're here, baby.

74
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:31,978
There, there.

75
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,858
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.

76
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:38,695
Hydration aids muscle mass.

77
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:46,620
All crew, consume shakes
with high caloric content.

78
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,692
What the hell is that?

79
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,532
lt's Christmas.

80
00:13:57,942 --> 00:13:59,011
We need the holidays...

81
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:00,661
...to show time is still moving.

82
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:01,698
Mission briefing...

83
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:03,341
...is about to start, captain.

84
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,335
Might wanna make your way down.

85
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,812
Well, l haven't had any breakfast yet.

86
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,655
ls this seat taken?

87
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:13,216
Hi, l'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.

88
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,058
Okay.

89
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,578
Look, no offense, but...

90
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:22,058
...l've been asleep two years.

91
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,136
l ain't here to be your friend.

92
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:26,696
l'm here to make money.

93
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,056
You got that?

94
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,782
Okay.

95
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,696
l bet a hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

96
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,739
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us.

97
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:40,052
lt's a corporate run,
they're not telling us shit.

98
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,018
Come on.

99
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:43,013
-A hundred.
-All right, you're on.

100
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,855
You look nervous, El.

101
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,141
-l'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
-l know you will.

102
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:53,178
Good morning.

103
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:56,336
For those of you l hired personally...

104
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:59,338
...it's nice to see you again.

105
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:03,811
For the rest of you, l am Meredith Vickers.
lt's my job to make sure you do yours.

106
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,770
Okay, then. On with the show.

107
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,814
Weyland Corporation.

108
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,973
Building better worlds.

109
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:18,735
Hello, friends.

110
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:22,294
My name is Peter Weyland.

111
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,980
l am your employer.

112
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:31,057
l am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...

113
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,892
...you have reached your destination.

114
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,453
And l am long dead.

115
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,939
May l rest in peace.

116
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:43,139
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.

117
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:46,214
And he is the closest thing to a son
l will ever have.

118
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,141
Unfortunately, he is not human.

119
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:50,616
He will never grow old...

120
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,659
...and he will never die.

121
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,619
And yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts...

122
00:15:56,782 --> 00:16:00,934
...for that would require the one thing
that David will never have.

123
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:02,217
A soul.

124
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,854
l have spent my entire...

125
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:07,377
...lifetime contemplating the questions:

126
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,095
Where do we come from?

127
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:10,821
What is our purpose?

128
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:12,455
What happens when we die?

129
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:16,896
And l have found two people who convinced
me they're on the verge of answering them.

130
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,415
Drs. Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

131
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,613
As far as you're concerned,
they're in charge.

132
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:30,093
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods...

133
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:33,698
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.

134
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:39,172
Well, my friends,
the time has finally come for his return.

135
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:40,692
Doctors, please.

136
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:45,738
The floor is yours.

137
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:55,813
Okay, wow.

138
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,301
All right.

139
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,180
l never had to follow a ghost before.

140
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,498
Okay, let me show you why you guys...

141
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:02,731
...are here.

142
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:14,851
These are images of archeological digs
from all over the Earth.

143
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:15,818
That's...

144
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:19,179
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.

145
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,135
That's Hawaiian there at the end,
then Mesopotamian.

146
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:25,260
Now, this one here
is our most recent discovery.

147
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:29,256
lt's a 35,000-year-old cave painting
from the lsle of Skye in Scotland.

148
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:33,581
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.

149
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:36,700
They shared no contact with one another,
and yet....

150
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:41,417
The same pictogram...

151
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:45,052
...showing men worshipping giant beings,
pointing to the stars...

152
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:48,095
...was discovered
at every last one of them.

153
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:51,136
And the only galactic system
that matched...

154
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:54,576
...was so far from Earth
that there's no way...

155
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:58,701
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations
could have possibly known about it.

156
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,295
But itjust so happens...

157
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,216
...that that system...

158
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:05,691
...has a sun...

159
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,055
...a lot like ours.

160
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:13,214
And, based on our long-range scans,
there seemed to be a planet.

161
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,777
Just one planet with a moon...

162
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,739
...capable of sustaining life.

163
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,133
And we arrived there this morning.

164
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:28,932
So you're saying we're here because of a map
you two kids found in a cave. ls that right?

165
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,410
-No.
-Yeah.

166
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,937
No. Not a map, an invitation.

167
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:37,421
From who?

168
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,534
We call them Engineers.

169
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:42,855
Engineers?

170
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:43,818
Do you mind...

171
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,540
...telling us what they engineered?

172
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,054
They engineered us.

173
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:53,498
Bullshit.

174
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,419
Okay, so do you...

175
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,174
...have anything to back that up?

176
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,574
Look, if you're willing to discount...

177
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,494
...centuries of Darwinism, that's....

178
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:07,492
But how do you know?

179
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,216
l don't.

180
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,738
But it's what l choose to believe.

181
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:40,491
Doctors.

182
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:45,421
Miss Vickers would like to have
a quick word before the adventure begins.

183
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:53,537
Wow, nice place.

184
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:57,661
lt's actually a separate module
with its own self-contained life support.

185
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,694
Air, food.

186
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:03,418
Anything Miss Vickers would need
to survive a hostile environment.

187
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,539
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.

188
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:06,691
Yes.

189
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:07,499
l do.

190
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:09,812
l like to minimize risk.

191
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:13,818
David, why don't you make
the doctors a drink?

192
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:17,021
l'll take a vodka. Up.

193
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:18,775
Charlie, look.

194
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,217
lt's a Pauling Med-Pod.

195
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,777
They only made a dozen of these.

196
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:24,738
Miss Shaw.

197
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:27,257
Please verbally state
the nature of your injury.

198
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,254
Please don't touch that.

199
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:31,299
lt's a very expensive piece of machinery.

200
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:34,211
lt does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?

201
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:38,496
There might be some confusion
about our relationship.

202
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,215
Weyland found you impressive enough
to fund this mission.

203
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:44,771
But l'm fairly certain your Engineers
are scribblings...

204
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,092
...of savages living in dirty little caves.

205
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:51,174
But let's say l'm wrong,
and you do find these beings down there...

206
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:54,338
...you won't engage them...

207
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,021
...you won't talk to them.

208
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,816
You will do nothing
but report back to me.

209
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,372
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...

210
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,100
...you're not telling us about?

211
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:07,299
My company...

212
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,896
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place
and bring you.

213
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,735
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...

214
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:15,655
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.

215
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,136
But you didn't.

216
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,055
And that makes you an employee.

217
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,373
But if we can't make contact...

218
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,931
...why did you even bring us here?

219
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,341
Weyland was a superstitious man.

220
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,297
He wanted a true believer onboard.

221
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:35,977
Cheers.

222
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:40,297
So no response?

223
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:41,971
l'm sorry, no.

224
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,973
Maybe they didn't understand it.

225
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,258
How are your lessons going, David?

226
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:51,812
l spent two years deconstructing
dozens of ancient languages...

227
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:53,980
...to their roots. l'm confident...

228
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,575
...l can communicate with them...

229
00:21:55,822 --> 00:21:57,892
...provided your thesis is correct.

230
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:01,178
''Provided it's correct.'' That's good.

231
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:04,140
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.

232
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:08,740
What are you smiling about?

233
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:10,699
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.

234
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,295
-Roger that.
-Yes, captain.

235
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,061
Descent trajectory mapped.

236
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:15,701
How we doing?

237
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:16,897
Great.

238
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:18,858
All right, boss.

239
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:20,252
All personnel...

240
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,537
...this is the captain.

241
00:22:21,702 --> 00:22:23,055
Brace for entry.

242
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:24,416
Yes, captain.

243
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,375
That means you too, Vickers.

244
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,611
All systems...

245
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:28,737
...online.

246
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:36,976
What is the atmosphere?

247
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:38,291
Atmosphere is...

248
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:39,656
...71 percent nitrogen...

249
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:40,937
...21 percent oxygen...

250
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:42,171
...traces of argon gas.

251
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:44,373
Whoa, now, that's weather.

252
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:45,577
Just like home.

253
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,494
lf you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

254
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:49,859
CO2 is over 3 percent.

255
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,978
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.

256
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:56,411
Peak portside.

257
00:22:56,662 --> 00:22:58,334
Whoa, 52,000!

258
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:00,618
lt makes Everest
look like a baby brother.

259
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:03,018
All right, take us around.

260
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,854
We'll use that as our point of entry.

261
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:09,332
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...

262
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:10,855
...a couple of hard spots.

263
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,455
Could be metal.

264
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:33,571
No radio, no heat source.

265
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,657
Nobody's home.

266
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,375
There is nothing in the desert...

267
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:40,774
...and no man needs nothing.

268
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,296
What was that?

269
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:45,493
Just something from a film l like.

270
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,015
Let's go through that gateway.

271
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:53,258
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.

272
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,375
Going through. Nice and slow.

273
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:07,177
Keep it steady, boys.

274
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:07,979
There.

275
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:10,054
No, what are you doing?

276
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:12,975
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?

277
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:16,099
Right there. God does not build in...

278
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:19,254
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...

279
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:20,855
...could you put us down there?

280
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:23,172
l wouldn't be any good
if l couldn't do that.

281
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:26,539
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

282
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:34,294
-One mile, port bow.
-One mile, port bow.

283
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:36,140
Engage landing sequence.

284
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:37,371
Switch to manual.

285
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,657
-Commence landing.
-Easy.

286
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:40,778
-Roger that.
-Yeah, baby, yeah.

287
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:44,781
Bringing her down in five.

288
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,660
-Preparing RCS thrusters.
-Four.

289
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:51,820
Two. Easy does it.

290
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:11,336
Generator systems are inactive.

291
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:13,777
Temperature is at 2.724 K.

292
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:26,131
Captain, would you...

293
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:28,213
...tell the survey team to suit up...

294
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:29,735
...and meet us in the airlock.

295
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,980
Only six hours left of daylight.

296
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:33,734
-Leave it till morning.
-No, no, no.

297
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:35,815
lt's Christmas, captain...

298
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:37,779
...and l want to open my presents.

299
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:38,858
You, boy.

300
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:40,296
You're coming with us.

301
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,021
l'd be delighted.

302
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:49,856
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.

303
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:53,495
Hey, Jackson...

304
00:25:53,822 --> 00:25:55,050
...what's that for?

305
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:56,771
Expedition security.

306
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:59,410
My job is to make sure
everybody is nice and safe.

307
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,775
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.

308
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:04,931
All right, then.

309
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:06,621
Good luck with that.

310
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:11,174
David, why are you wearing a suit, man?

311
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:13,691
l beg your pardon?

312
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:15,454
You don't breathe, remember?

313
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:17,658
So why wear a suit?

314
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:20,292
l was designed like this...

315
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:24,495
...because you people are more comfortable
interacting with your own kind.

316
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:28,779
lf l didn't wear the suit,
it would defeat the purpose.

317
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,579
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?

318
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:33,541
Not too close, l hope.

319
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:45,416
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.

320
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,214
Ramp will open in five...

321
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:56,295
...four, three, two, one.

322
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,216
Hey.

323
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:17,217
This is just one small step for mankind.

324
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:19,017
Seriously?

325
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,660
You ready to do this? l know you are.

326
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:37,812
Hey, Fifield.

327
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:39,097
l want a spectrograph on this.

328
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:41,412
l want to know if it's natural
or if somebody put it there.

329
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:44,142
l can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what l can...

330
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:46,338
...tell you is, it's hollow.

331
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:13,097
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

332
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:14,537
Affirmative.

333
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,090
We see it.

334
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:23,659
Okay, ready?

335
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,221
-Yeah.
-Let's do it.

336
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,338
-After you.
-After you.

337
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:00,412
Okay.

338
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:01,571
Careful.

339
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:04,133
Prometheus, we're going in.

340
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:05,417
Copy that.

341
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:38,378
What's back here?

342
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,578
Some kind of a corridor?

343
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:43,936
Mr. Fifield,
let's get a grid of the structure.

344
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:45,421
l want the whole interior.

345
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:48,577
lf there's anything in here
worth looking at...

346
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:49,970
...these pups'll find them.

347
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:51,492
''Pups''?

348
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:53,892
Yeah, pups. My pups.

349
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:10,741
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

350
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:15,897
Copy that.

351
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,697
Well, l'll be damned.

352
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:44,016
Fifield, you got a read?

353
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:45,251
Yeah.

354
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:48,780
Pups are saying this way.

355
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:07,975
Look at this.

356
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:16,580
Oh, Charlie.

357
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,411
Jesus.

358
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,494
The sunlight is heating the water.

359
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:25,655
Check out the humidity.

360
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:27,380
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.

361
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:28,897
Outside...

362
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:31,018
...it's completely toxic, and in here...

363
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,173
...there's nothing. lt's breathable.

364
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:36,695
What are you doing?

365
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,012
-Don't be an idiot.
-Don't be a skeptic.

366
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:41,538
There's something
generating an atmosphere.

367
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,096
David?

368
00:31:43,262 --> 00:31:45,332
-Dr. Holloway is correct.
-Cleaner than Earth...

369
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:46,617
...actually.

370
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:47,658
They were terraforming.

371
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:49,381
Please don't do--

372
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,260
l'm not wearing this thing anymore.

373
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:53,010
Wish me luck, baby.

374
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:55,650
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.

375
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:13,413
You crazy bastard.

376
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,096
Connect our suit cameras...

377
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:23,335
...if you want to continue watching this
freak show. We are taking our helmets off.

378
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,060
Copy that. Switching feeds.

379
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:30,052
Well, come on. Pay up.

380
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,336
-Pay what?
-What do you mean, ''Pay what''?

381
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:36,858
Something is manufacturing
breathable air down there. That, mate...

382
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:39,661
-...is terraforming.
-No, no. The bet was why we came here.

383
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:42,575
lf you said a dead old man wanted
to talk to Martians, l'd pay.

384
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,061
Come on, a hundred credits.

385
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:47,102
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that?

386
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,172
lt's minus 12 in here.

387
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:53,378
So why is this water not frozen?

388
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:54,895
Maybe it ain't water.

389
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:57,021
Maybe it's Martian piss.

390
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:01,894
That's your scientific theory?

391
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:03,893
ls it? Mr. Biology?

392
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,739
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.

393
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,460
Some kind of sediment, perhaps.

394
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:32,777
lmpressive.

395
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,378
What was that?

396
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:54,411
David?

397
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:55,899
David?

398
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:58,456
What is that?

399
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:01,258
David?

400
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:10,856
Ellie!

401
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:16,298
What was that?

402
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,859
l'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.

403
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:21,217
-Come on, El. Let's go.
-Whose idea was that?

404
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:22,532
Keep up!

405
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,499
Come on!

406
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:34,416
Where did he go?

407
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,015
Wait, wait, wait.

408
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:48,740
There it is. There it is. There it is.

409
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:52,091
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.

410
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:53,741
What do you mean ''them''?

411
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:56,335
lt is them, Ellie.

412
00:34:57,102 --> 00:34:58,615
lt looks like a door...

413
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:02,770
...and he's been decapitated by it.

414
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,415
Son of a bitch.

415
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:08,421
They were right.

416
00:35:11,782 --> 00:35:13,773
What did you want them to be? Wrong?

417
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:18,491
David...

418
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:20,774
...please tell me you can read that.

419
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:22,616
Perhaps.

420
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:26,374
No, l'm out of here.

421
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:30,054
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?

422
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,697
What?

423
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,942
Look, l'm just a geologist.

424
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,172
l like rocks. l love rocks!

425
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:41,977
Now it's clear
you two don't give a shit about rocks.

426
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,610
But what you do seem to care about
is gigantic dead...

427
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:45,453
...bodies.

428
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:48,534
As l don't really have anything
to contribute in the gigantic...

429
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,055
...dead body arena...

430
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:54,892
...l want to go back to the ship,
if you don't mind.

431
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:58,938
Anyone wanna...

432
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:01,138
...join me, hey? You staying?

433
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:03,771
No, ship's good.

434
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,058
Yeah. Ship very good.

435
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:09,894
Congratulations on meeting your maker.

436
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:11,811
Thank you.

437
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,178
Pull yourself...

438
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:14,218
...together, man.

439
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,382
And l thought you were the crazy one.

440
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:29,660
Do you have the carbon reader?

441
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,210
Thank you.

442
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:40,297
How long's it been dead?

443
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:43,977
Two thousand years...

444
00:36:44,142 --> 00:36:45,257
...give or take.

445
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:50,215
What are you doing, David?

446
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,780
l'm attempting to open the door.

447
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:55,137
Wait. We don't know
what's on the other side.

448
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:58,775
Oops. Sorry.

449
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,492
Look, Ford. lt's the head.

450
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,737
An amazing state of preservation.

451
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:19,694
-We'll take it in.
-Yeah.

452
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:25,101
Remarkably human.

453
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,654
Beautiful painting.

454
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:45,970
lt's a mural.

455
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:58,699
Stop.

456
00:37:58,862 --> 00:37:59,977
Stop. Don't touch it.

457
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:01,211
Sorry.

458
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:04,213
Please, don't touch anything.

459
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:05,739
Sweating.

460
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:44,251
Organic.

461
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:51,497
Oh, no.

462
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:54,376
Charlie, the murals are changing.

463
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,851
l think we've affected the atmosphere
in the room.

464
00:38:57,022 --> 00:38:58,853
Charlie, do you copy?

465
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:00,618
Oh, the head!

466
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:02,893
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!

467
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,495
-Boss.
-What you got?

468
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:18,293
We got an incoming storm front.

469
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:19,577
Silica...

470
00:39:19,742 --> 00:39:21,653
...and lots of static. This is not good.

471
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:22,538
l see it.

472
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:27,292
Ground crew...

473
00:39:27,462 --> 00:39:28,417
...this is Janek.

474
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,334
l need you to hustle back right now.

475
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,055
Ground crew, do you copy me?

476
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:33,496
l got 200-kilometer...

477
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,141
...winds of airborne silica...

478
00:39:35,302 --> 00:39:36,735
...and enough static to fry your suit.

479
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:38,335
Copy that, sir.

480
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,412
We need more time.

481
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:41,376
l'll be closing the outer...

482
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:42,691
...doors in 15 minutes.

483
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:44,932
l sincerely hope you can make it.

484
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:49,413
Charlie! David!

485
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,017
We must leave now.

486
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:54,694
This is just another tomb.

487
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,171
David!

488
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,739
-On three.
-Two, three, up.

489
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,221
Let's go!

490
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:08,614
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.

491
00:40:11,582 --> 00:40:14,176
David, we are leaving!

492
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:24,138
Come on!

493
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:25,940
Damn it, they've already taken off.

494
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,012
Come on, let's go.

495
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:31,614
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.

496
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:33,738
All right, come on. Let's go.

497
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:49,735
Go faster!

498
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:13,737
Charlie! The head!

499
00:41:14,662 --> 00:41:15,174
Ellie, no!

500
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:15,979
What are you doing?

501
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:25,172
Hatch closure...

502
00:41:25,342 --> 00:41:26,331
-...in five seconds.
-Shit.

503
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:28,292
Damn it, hold on!

504
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:31,292
Goddamn it.

505
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:32,531
Door closing.

506
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:35,697
Ellie, don't move!

507
00:41:40,702 --> 00:41:41,339
Charlie!

508
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:45,731
Grab my hand!

509
00:41:56,462 --> 00:41:56,860
No!

510
00:41:57,942 --> 00:41:58,818
No, Ellie!

511
00:41:58,982 --> 00:41:59,732
Ellie!

512
00:42:36,462 --> 00:42:37,417
Got it.

513
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,814
So, what was that, Ellie?

514
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:49,411
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...

515
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:50,981
...almost killing yourself!

516
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:52,097
Are you all right?

517
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:53,781
Yes.

518
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:55,177
Thank you, David.

519
00:42:55,662 --> 00:42:57,095
My pleasure.

520
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,174
Doctors, it's real good to have...

521
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,537
...you back,
but where's Millburn and Fifield?

522
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:03,340
Aren't they back yet?

523
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,215
-Get them up for me.
-All right.

524
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:10,694
We've been here before, Fifield.

525
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:13,422
l don't know. lt all looks the same to me.

526
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,298
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.

527
00:43:16,862 --> 00:43:19,501
Between the static electricity
and the wind speed...

528
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:21,857
...well, there ain't no safe way
to come get you.

529
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:23,178
What?

530
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:26,698
The temperature is dropping rapidly,
so get your helmets on and stay warm...

531
00:43:27,342 --> 00:43:29,253
...until the storm passes.

532
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:30,218
Captain...

533
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:33,574
...can you get a message to the scientist
and his zealot girlfriend?

534
00:43:34,702 --> 00:43:35,691
You got a pen nearby?

535
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:37,693
No. No, l think we got it.

536
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:40,133
Tell them l said...themselves.

537
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:42,058
Copy?

538
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:44,372
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...

539
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,737
...and we'll come get you in the morning.

540
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:49,377
Well, which way now?

541
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:50,292
All right.

542
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,418
Well, which way, huh?

543
00:44:05,822 --> 00:44:07,733
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.

544
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:09,097
David.

545
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:14,059
So are they all dead?

546
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:17,259
What? Who?

547
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,011
Your Engineers.

548
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:21,094
Are they all dead or aren't they?

549
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:22,695
l don't know.

550
00:44:22,862 --> 00:44:24,136
We just got here.

551
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:25,213
Scan.

552
00:44:27,822 --> 00:44:29,221
Do you care if they're dead?

553
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:31,461
Weyland cared.

554
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:33,255
Dr. Shaw.

555
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,531
Have a look at this.

556
00:44:39,022 --> 00:44:40,899
-That's not an exoskeleton.
-No.

557
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:42,973
l think it's a helmet.

558
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:45,412
-Let's see if we can lift it up.
-We should...

559
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,935
...be able to prize this open.

560
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:49,892
lt's too heavy for us. David?

561
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:57,891
Careful.

562
00:44:58,182 --> 00:44:59,820
Like so.

563
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:14,854
What is that on its head?

564
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,298
lt looks like new cells.

565
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,093
-ln a state of....
-Change.

566
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:20,933
Yes.

567
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:22,536
Changing into what?

568
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:25,092
Can you run a stem line
into the locus coeruleus?

569
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,573
l think we can trick the nervous system
into thinking it's still alive.

570
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,296
-Thirty amps.
-Okay.

571
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:32,692
No more.

572
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:36,138
Let me make an incision.

573
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:37,578
Okay.

574
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:44,295
Go up, 40.

575
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:47,291
Okay, 40 up.

576
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:49,895
Did you see that?

577
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,180
-Yes.
-Yep. See?

578
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:54,855
Go up another 10.

579
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:56,581
Okay, up 10.

580
00:45:58,862 --> 00:45:59,897
Maybe it's a little...

581
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:01,814
-...too much. Go down 10.
-Okay.

582
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:03,335
-Down 10.
-Down another 20.

583
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:04,618
Okay, l'm trying.

584
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:07,140
l'm trying, it's not going down.

585
00:46:07,302 --> 00:46:08,530
Full down. Ford...

586
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:09,578
...stop it.

587
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:10,936
Oh, God.

588
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:13,173
David, contain it! Now!

589
00:46:13,342 --> 00:46:14,536
Contain it? Turn it off!

590
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:16,215
Oh, God. The smell!

591
00:46:17,062 --> 00:46:18,051
Oh, God, look at that.

592
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:19,177
Look at that.

593
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:20,457
lt's getting worse.

594
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,220
Mortal, after all.

595
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,576
Ford, take a sample.

596
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:48,262
Let's have a look.

597
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:55,011
No, sir, l will take care of it.

598
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:57,617
Yes, sir, understood. l'm sorry.

599
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:01,102
Fortunately, slightly premature.

600
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,341
Of course, sir.

601
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:34,737
Miss Vickers.

602
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:40,256
What did he say, David?

603
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:42,817
l don't think he'd want me to tell you.

604
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:52,452
What did he say?

605
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:53,338
l'm sorry...

606
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:54,617
...that's confidential.

607
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:56,613
So help me God...

608
00:47:56,942 --> 00:48:00,776
...l will find the cord that makes you run
and l will cut it.

609
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:03,533
What did he say?

610
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:06,216
He said:

611
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:09,571
''Try harder.''

612
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:13,377
Cup of tea, ma'am?

613
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:30,331
Genetic view.

614
00:48:30,502 --> 00:48:31,332
Okay.

615
00:48:31,502 --> 00:48:33,811
Let's have a look at its DNA.

616
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:43,817
lsolate the strand.

617
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:46,497
Okay.

618
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:49,098
Compare it to the gene sample?

619
00:48:49,422 --> 00:48:50,491
Yeah.

620
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:51,817
Overlay.

621
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:53,416
Processing.

622
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:56,576
Processing.

623
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,577
DNA match.

624
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:03,335
Oh, my God.

625
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:23,976
lt's us.

626
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:25,417
lt's everything.

627
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:31,093
What killed them?

628
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:48,772
Big things...

629
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:50,853
...have small beginnings.

630
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:01,254
Am l interrupting?

631
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:03,937
l thought you might be running low.

632
00:50:07,822 --> 00:50:10,620
-Pour yourself a glass, pal.
-Thank you, but l'm afraid...

633
00:50:10,782 --> 00:50:12,135
...it would be wasted on me.

634
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:14,852
Right, l almost forgot you're not a real boy.

635
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:21,091
l'm very sorry that your Engineers
are all gone.

636
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:28,097
You think we wasted our time
coming here, don't you?

637
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:33,893
Your question depends on me understanding
what you hoped to achieve by coming here.

638
00:50:34,062 --> 00:50:36,781
What we hoped to achieve
was to meet our makers.

639
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:37,818
To get answers.

640
00:50:38,422 --> 00:50:40,140
Why they even...

641
00:50:40,302 --> 00:50:41,735
...made us in the first place.

642
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:46,497
Why do you think your people made me?

643
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:48,857
Because we could.

644
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:53,937
Can you imagine how disappointing
it would be...

645
00:50:54,102 --> 00:50:56,138
...to hear the same thing
from your creator?

646
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:02,012
l guess it's...

647
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:03,820
...good you can't be disappointed.

648
00:51:04,382 --> 00:51:05,815
Yes. lt's wonderful...

649
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:07,099
...actually.

650
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:08,934
May l ask you something?

651
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:11,098
Please do.

652
00:51:11,262 --> 00:51:12,456
How far would you go...

653
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:15,696
...to get what you came all this way for?

654
00:51:15,862 --> 00:51:17,181
Your answers.

655
00:51:18,382 --> 00:51:19,576
What are you willing to do?

656
00:51:19,982 --> 00:51:21,381
Anything and everything.

657
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,772
That's worth drinking to, l'd imagine.

658
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:37,539
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

659
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:43,101
Good health.

660
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:48,976
lt's those things.

661
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:53,577
Are they real?

662
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:56,411
Of course they're real.

663
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:59,140
Jesus Christ. l mean....

664
00:52:00,382 --> 00:52:01,497
Look at the pile.

665
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:03,939
Look how high up they are.

666
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:05,538
lt looks like...

667
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:09,741
-...they were running from something.
-Okay. Don't touch, okay?

668
00:52:10,302 --> 00:52:14,341
Man, this thing is opened up
from the inside.

669
00:52:14,502 --> 00:52:15,981
Almost like it exploded.

670
00:52:16,942 --> 00:52:20,776
Looks like a scene out some sort
of holocaust painting, you know?

671
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:34,616
Well....

672
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:43,054
So, whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

673
00:52:43,222 --> 00:52:44,257
Millburn, Fifield.

674
00:52:44,422 --> 00:52:45,537
This is Prometheus.

675
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:46,851
What is your position?

676
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:49,380
Prometheus, this is Millburn.

677
00:52:49,662 --> 00:52:51,493
We are at 7-4-0...

678
00:52:51,662 --> 00:52:53,812
...1-4-7-7. Why?

679
00:52:53,982 --> 00:52:57,372
Just got a ping
about one click west of you.

680
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,055
What do you mean ''a ping''?

681
00:52:59,502 --> 00:53:01,094
Well, whatever...

682
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:03,173
...that probe is picking up...

683
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:04,457
...it's not dead.

684
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:06,214
lt's reading a life form.

685
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:08,777
-What?
-Okay, what do you mean, ''a life form''?

686
00:53:09,262 --> 00:53:10,775
ls it--? ls it moving?

687
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:13,379
No, l don't think so.

688
00:53:13,662 --> 00:53:14,936
Captain, you're...

689
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:16,581
...obviously not seeing...

690
00:53:16,742 --> 00:53:18,061
...what we're seeing here.

691
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:20,372
If you were,
you wouldn't be talking about a ping.

692
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,770
l know, boys.

693
00:53:22,102 --> 00:53:25,219
Your signal has been coming in
sporadically since the storm hit.

694
00:53:26,382 --> 00:53:27,815
That's no good to us down here!

695
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:33,056
ls it--? ls it moving?
Are these things moving?

696
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:38,620
No. No, itjust disappeared, actually.

697
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,217
Must be a glitch.

698
00:53:40,382 --> 00:53:42,771
What do you mean, ''a glitch''?

699
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:43,818
All right, boys.

700
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,011
Sleep tight.

701
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:48,295
Try not to bugger each other.

702
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,373
Captain, what do you mean, ''a glitch''?

703
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:53,416
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.

704
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:55,415
Now, he said--

705
00:53:56,422 --> 00:53:59,016
-He said one click west, yeah?
-Yeah.

706
00:53:59,822 --> 00:54:01,050
Now, we....

707
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:03,019
We don't want to check that out, do we?

708
00:54:03,182 --> 00:54:04,171
Shit, no.

709
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:05,570
Where are we gonna go?

710
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,697
East.

711
00:54:08,222 --> 00:54:09,450
Yeah, east.

712
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:13,542
A fucking glitch, man.
''Pings, glitch, life form.'' What the fuck?

713
00:54:13,782 --> 00:54:17,855
Based on the behavior of the subject
in these holographic recordings...

714
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,582
...we're attempting to identify
what caused the head...

715
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:22,778
...to combust. l can't help but wonder...

716
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:25,737
...was there an outbreak here?

717
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:31,172
You rang...

718
00:54:31,342 --> 00:54:33,412
-...ma'am?
-l have something important...

719
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:35,334
...to tell you. What is that?

720
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:37,700
This is...

721
00:54:37,862 --> 00:54:40,137
...a rose that l had frozen
with the champagne.

722
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:43,260
l was gonna give it to you
when we found what we came for.

723
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:46,220
We did find what we came for.

724
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:47,737
They were here. This is--

725
00:54:47,902 --> 00:54:52,293
The most significant discovery
in the history...

726
00:54:52,462 --> 00:54:54,532
...of mankind. Oh, l know.

727
00:54:57,262 --> 00:54:59,014
lt's incredible, it really is.

728
00:54:59,182 --> 00:55:02,857
But l wanted to talk to them.

729
00:55:03,182 --> 00:55:05,901
l mean, don't you want to know
why they came?

730
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:08,701
Why they abandoned us?

731
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:10,854
l just want answers, baby.

732
00:55:11,022 --> 00:55:12,421
We were right, Charlie.

733
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:14,853
l have proof.

734
00:55:16,782 --> 00:55:17,658
Look.

735
00:55:23,382 --> 00:55:26,374
Their genetic material predates ours.

736
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:27,975
We come from them.

737
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:30,974
-You're kidding me.
-No.

738
00:55:33,862 --> 00:55:35,011
Okay.

739
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:36,617
Okay.

740
00:55:37,582 --> 00:55:41,575
Okay. l guess you can take
your father's cross off now.

741
00:55:42,302 --> 00:55:44,452
Why would l want to do that?

742
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,614
Because they made us.

743
00:55:46,782 --> 00:55:48,010
And who made them?

744
00:55:48,902 --> 00:55:50,858
Well, exactly. We'll never know.

745
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:53,013
But here's what we do know:

746
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:56,857
That there is nothing special
about the creation of life.

747
00:55:57,022 --> 00:55:58,375
Right? Anybody can do it.

748
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:01,420
All you need is a dash of DNA
and half a brain, right?

749
00:56:04,302 --> 00:56:05,451
l can't.

750
00:56:06,982 --> 00:56:09,132
l can't create life.

751
00:56:10,902 --> 00:56:13,462
What does that say about me?

752
00:56:14,702 --> 00:56:17,580
Ellie, that's not-- l didn't mean--

753
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,221
l wasn't talking about--

754
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:20,940
Children?

755
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:22,251
Us.

756
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:26,778
Hey, hey, hey.

757
00:56:26,942 --> 00:56:28,261
Hey.

758
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:30,250
Hey.

759
00:56:31,062 --> 00:56:32,859
Elizabeth Shaw...

760
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:36,378
...you are the most special person
l have ever met in my life...

761
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:38,294
...and l love you.

762
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:43,376
Hey.

763
00:57:26,622 --> 00:57:28,021
How much longer will this take?

764
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:31,421
l don't know.

765
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,015
l'm just a captain.

766
00:57:41,782 --> 00:57:44,137
That thing sounds like a dying cat,
by the way.

767
00:57:44,302 --> 00:57:47,977
l'll have you know that this thing...

768
00:57:48,142 --> 00:57:50,258
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.

769
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,140
Am l supposed to know who that is?

770
00:57:57,902 --> 00:57:59,335
You know...

771
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:01,501
...if you wanna get laid...

772
00:58:01,662 --> 00:58:03,459
...you really don't have to pretend...

773
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:05,658
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.

774
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:10,058
You could just say,
''Hey, l'm trying to get laid.''

775
00:58:10,222 --> 00:58:12,338
l could. l could say that, right?

776
00:58:12,982 --> 00:58:14,381
But it wouldn't make sense...

777
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:18,535
...why l would fly myself half a billion miles
from every man on Earth...

778
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:20,613
...if l wanted to get laid, would it?

779
00:58:22,702 --> 00:58:24,135
Hey, Vickers.

780
00:58:24,302 --> 00:58:26,054
Hey, Vickers.

781
00:58:27,182 --> 00:58:28,934
l was wondering....

782
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:34,375
Are you a robot?

783
00:58:42,382 --> 00:58:43,701
My room.

784
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:45,578
Ten minutes.

785
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:53,417
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

786
00:58:53,582 --> 00:58:54,492
Love the one

787
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:55,731
You're with

788
00:58:55,942 --> 00:58:57,295
Love the one you're with

789
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:05,097
Millburn.

790
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,173
What's all this black stuff?

791
00:59:11,462 --> 00:59:12,372
Gazpacho.

792
00:59:14,862 --> 00:59:15,817
ls that tobacco?

793
00:59:16,662 --> 00:59:17,538
ls that tobacco...

794
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:18,771
...in your respirator?

795
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:20,455
Yeah, sure.

796
00:59:24,782 --> 00:59:26,215
Tobacco.

797
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:30,332
On behalf of scientists everywhere,
l am ashamed to count you amongst us...

798
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:32,060
...Fifield. Really.

799
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:37,177
-Hey, Millburn.
-Yeah?

800
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:38,218
You see this thing?

801
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:41,579
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?

802
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:43,973
Something they worshiped? What?

803
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:45,814
-lt kind of looks like--
-What's that?

804
00:59:46,502 --> 00:59:47,491
What the hell is that?

805
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:48,856
Oh, my God. Okay.

806
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:50,296
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.

807
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,612
This is okay, l can handle this.

808
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:54,217
Hey, baby.

809
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:55,653
Hey.

810
00:59:56,622 --> 00:59:57,737
Come in, Prometheus.

811
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:01,498
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.

812
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:05,661
Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.

813
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,336
And it's beautiful.

814
01:00:08,782 --> 01:00:09,419
Okay!

815
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:13,339
Prometheus...

816
01:00:13,502 --> 01:00:14,218
...we have two.

817
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:16,771
Look at you. Look at you, baby.

818
01:00:17,262 --> 01:00:19,617
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?

819
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,216
-You need to stay calm.
-What's there to be calm about?

820
01:00:22,382 --> 01:00:24,691
You need to stay calm
because she is beautiful.

821
01:00:24,862 --> 01:00:26,534
What makes you think that's female?

822
01:00:26,702 --> 01:00:27,896
She's a lady. Look!

823
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:34,697
Hey.

824
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:36,531
She's mesmerized.

825
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:38,978
Come here. Come here.

826
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:42,211
lt's okay.

827
01:00:42,382 --> 01:00:43,974
lt's okay. lt's okay.

828
01:00:44,662 --> 01:00:45,890
Hey, baby.

829
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:49,818
You're strong!

830
01:00:50,502 --> 01:00:51,139
You should...

831
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:51,939
...help me now.

832
01:00:52,102 --> 01:00:52,739
Get it off.

833
01:00:55,222 --> 01:00:56,052
Cut it here, man!

834
01:00:56,222 --> 01:00:57,257
l ain't touching that!

835
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,133
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

836
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:02,258
-lt's getting tighter.
-l ain't touching it!

837
01:01:02,422 --> 01:01:05,095
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!

838
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,093
God, you're making it worse!

839
01:01:07,262 --> 01:01:09,014
lt's tightening! lt's tight--

840
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:10,531
lt's breaking my arm!

841
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:12,939
Shit!

842
01:01:13,342 --> 01:01:14,172
Cut it off!

843
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:15,980
Cut it off!

844
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:16,938
Cut it off!

845
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:17,693
Cut it off!

846
01:01:20,582 --> 01:01:21,173
Shit!

847
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:22,058
Oh, my God!

848
01:01:23,302 --> 01:01:25,258
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

849
01:01:26,622 --> 01:01:27,816
lt's in my suit.

850
01:01:27,982 --> 01:01:28,732
Jesus Christ.

851
01:02:26,382 --> 01:02:28,134
Shaw, you up?

852
01:02:29,742 --> 01:02:30,857
Yeah, what's up?

853
01:02:31,222 --> 01:02:33,338
The storm passed,
but l can't reach Millburn...

854
01:02:33,502 --> 01:02:36,574
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down,
see if l can rustle them up.

855
01:02:36,742 --> 01:02:37,811
Okay.

856
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:40,215
Any idea where they are?

857
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,897
Last time they radioed in
was where you found your head.

858
01:02:44,422 --> 01:02:46,299
Okay, we're coming.

859
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:47,178
All right.

860
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:50,061
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.

861
01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:51,177
All right, boss.

862
01:02:52,942 --> 01:02:55,615
-Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
-No, captain.

863
01:02:55,782 --> 01:02:58,421
-lt's gotta be in the hardware.
-What glitch, captain?

864
01:02:58,582 --> 01:03:01,016
One of them probes picked up a life form.

865
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:02,612
Pops up every hour...

866
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:05,580
...for a couple of seconds
and then it's gone.

867
01:03:05,742 --> 01:03:07,255
l can find the probe and fix it.

868
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:08,935
Knock yourself out.

869
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:11,655
Be careful, doctors.

870
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:33,694
Fifield!

871
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:37,457
Millburn?

872
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:42,901
All right, come on down.

873
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:05,895
David, are you alone?

874
01:04:06,982 --> 01:04:08,051
Yes, Miss Vickers.

875
01:04:08,222 --> 01:04:10,292
Uplink your feed to my room.

876
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:11,690
Copy.

877
01:05:50,102 --> 01:05:52,218
You son of a bitch.

878
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:55,860
You cut me off.

879
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:17,581
What is this?

880
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:22,091
-Charlie?
-l just tripped.

881
01:06:22,382 --> 01:06:23,497
Oh, my God, you're sick!

882
01:06:23,662 --> 01:06:25,493
l'm okay, baby. Come on.

883
01:06:25,662 --> 01:06:26,651
Fifield?

884
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:28,611
Millburn?

885
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:36,301
Hey, Chance. l wouldn't touch...

886
01:06:36,462 --> 01:06:37,577
...that if l were you.

887
01:06:40,342 --> 01:06:41,616
Dr. Shaw?

888
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:42,851
Yeah?

889
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:44,933
Do we have any idea what is...

890
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:46,455
...oozing out of these vases?

891
01:06:46,622 --> 01:06:49,659
No. They weren't like this
last time we were here.

892
01:06:54,182 --> 01:06:55,251
Captain?

893
01:06:55,462 --> 01:06:56,690
What?

894
01:06:56,902 --> 01:06:57,812
Who is it? Which one?

895
01:06:57,982 --> 01:06:59,734
-Who is it?
-lt's Millburn.

896
01:07:00,262 --> 01:07:02,059
-Ellie.
-Don't touch him. Hold on.

897
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:03,018
Ellie, honey.

898
01:07:03,182 --> 01:07:04,934
Charlie, what's wrong?

899
01:07:05,102 --> 01:07:07,536
l need you to look at me, okay?

900
01:07:07,702 --> 01:07:08,771
You know infections...

901
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:09,931
...so, what do you see?

902
01:07:10,102 --> 01:07:11,660
This is not good, baby.

903
01:07:11,822 --> 01:07:13,653
You look at me,
you tell me what you see.

904
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:18,572
Oh, my God.

905
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:20,535
Ford, get over here.

906
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:22,215
lt's okay. Janek?

907
01:07:22,382 --> 01:07:23,940
-What?
-We have to go now!

908
01:07:24,102 --> 01:07:24,773
What do you see?

909
01:07:24,942 --> 01:07:26,853
Honey, what do you see?

910
01:07:27,022 --> 01:07:29,013
Holloway's sick. He's not good.

911
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:29,739
l see movement...

912
01:07:29,902 --> 01:07:30,539
...in his esophagus.

913
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:36,294
-Come on, baby.
-No. l'm okay.

914
01:07:36,462 --> 01:07:37,372
Janek!

915
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:38,691
Come over and help me!

916
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:41,092
-l'm okay.
-Ford, get over there. What's happening?

917
01:07:41,262 --> 01:07:42,217
-l'm okay.
-Let's go!

918
01:07:42,382 --> 01:07:43,451
Help me with him.

919
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:46,375
l got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

920
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,179
Prometheus...

921
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:47,979
...come in.

922
01:07:48,142 --> 01:07:49,973
-Watch your head.
-Okay. l'm okay.

923
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:51,814
-Holloway.
-Get him up.

924
01:07:51,982 --> 01:07:53,734
-Come on.
-Prometheus, come in.

925
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:55,017
ls anyone there?

926
01:07:55,662 --> 01:07:56,856
This is Vickers.

927
01:07:57,022 --> 01:07:59,377
l need a medical team
standing by the airlock.

928
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:01,658
Full quarantine fail-safe.

929
01:08:01,822 --> 01:08:03,221
Holloway's sick.

930
01:08:03,382 --> 01:08:04,576
Sick with what?

931
01:08:04,742 --> 01:08:06,778
-Just do it.
-Let's get him back to the ship.

932
01:08:06,942 --> 01:08:08,933
-lt's not safe down here.
-Charlie?

933
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:09,898
l'm suiting up.

934
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:11,654
-Charlie, talk to me.
-Move!

935
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:14,052
-What was that back there?
-Let's go, people!

936
01:08:15,702 --> 01:08:17,772
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!

937
01:08:17,942 --> 01:08:18,742
Ellie!

938
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:07,691
He don't look too good.

939
01:12:07,902 --> 01:12:10,496
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off.

940
01:12:10,662 --> 01:12:11,333
l don't know.

941
01:12:11,622 --> 01:12:14,500
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.

942
01:12:14,862 --> 01:12:15,897
Aye, captain.

943
01:12:16,062 --> 01:12:18,337
Oh, God. l'm so sorry.

944
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:21,176
Come on!

945
01:12:21,342 --> 01:12:22,980
Please!

946
01:12:27,622 --> 01:12:30,011
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?

947
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,294
Vickers, that is an order!

948
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:34,620
Get that goddamn door open!

949
01:12:34,782 --> 01:12:37,216
-Look at me. lt's too late, l'm sick.
-No, it's not.

950
01:12:37,382 --> 01:12:38,531
Come on!

951
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:39,893
Ford, help me!

952
01:12:40,262 --> 01:12:42,218
Airlock crew, if you can hear me,
it's Janek.

953
01:12:42,382 --> 01:12:43,940
Open that back door right now!

954
01:12:44,102 --> 01:12:45,217
Hold that door!

955
01:12:45,382 --> 01:12:46,019
Prometheus...

956
01:12:46,182 --> 01:12:46,898
...do you copy?

957
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:49,451
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!

958
01:12:49,622 --> 01:12:50,657
Open it.

959
01:12:57,422 --> 01:12:58,650
What the hell is this?

960
01:12:58,822 --> 01:13:00,301
He's not coming onboard.

961
01:13:00,462 --> 01:13:01,895
Vickers, this is a sick man.

962
01:13:02,062 --> 01:13:03,131
l see that. That's why...

963
01:13:03,302 --> 01:13:04,291
...he's not coming on!

964
01:13:05,062 --> 01:13:06,017
Charlie!

965
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:07,171
Chance, get over here!

966
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:11,013
Please!

967
01:13:11,182 --> 01:13:12,217
We can still help him!

968
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,290
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship!

969
01:13:16,462 --> 01:13:17,975
l won't leave him!

970
01:13:18,142 --> 01:13:18,938
Then stay!

971
01:13:19,102 --> 01:13:20,217
Wait! We could...

972
01:13:20,382 --> 01:13:22,020
...put him on the Med-Pod!

973
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:23,171
Please don't do this.

974
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:24,616
lt's okay, Ellie.

975
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:25,737
Vickers!

976
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:26,857
What are you doing?

977
01:13:27,142 --> 01:13:28,257
l love you, baby.

978
01:13:28,422 --> 01:13:29,218
-l love you.
-No.

979
01:13:29,382 --> 01:13:30,610
l'm telling you, stay back!

980
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:31,453
Do it.

981
01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:32,452
Stay back!

982
01:13:32,622 --> 01:13:33,657
No! No, Charlie!

983
01:13:33,822 --> 01:13:34,379
-Do it.
-No!

984
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:41,051
No!

985
01:13:43,022 --> 01:13:44,455
No!

986
01:13:44,782 --> 01:13:46,374
No!

987
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:50,937
Charlie!

988
01:13:53,582 --> 01:13:55,140
No!

989
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:09,859
My deepest condolences.

990
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:12,860
l'm going to have to take this.

991
01:14:13,022 --> 01:14:14,501
lt may be contaminated.

992
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:19,461
lf there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

993
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:24,611
You need-- We need to run blood work
on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

994
01:14:25,262 --> 01:14:26,581
Yes, of course.

995
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,090
Yes?

996
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,417
l understand how...

997
01:14:37,582 --> 01:14:39,015
...inappropriate this is...

998
01:14:39,782 --> 01:14:42,012
...given the circumstances.

999
01:14:42,182 --> 01:14:45,060
But as you ordered
quarantine fail-safes...

1000
01:14:46,822 --> 01:14:49,017
...it's my responsibility to ask.

1001
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:53,895
Have you and Dr. Holloway
had any intimate contact recently?

1002
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:56,297
Since you and he were...

1003
01:14:56,462 --> 01:14:57,656
...so close...

1004
01:14:58,542 --> 01:14:59,338
...l want to be...

1005
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:00,901
...as thorough as poss--

1006
01:15:02,822 --> 01:15:03,618
My, my.

1007
01:15:07,662 --> 01:15:08,492
You're pregnant.

1008
01:15:11,262 --> 01:15:11,899
What?

1009
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,014
From the look of it, three months so.

1010
01:15:15,462 --> 01:15:18,420
No, that's impossible.

1011
01:15:18,702 --> 01:15:20,738
l can't be pregnant.

1012
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:24,219
Did you have intercourse
with Dr. Holloway?

1013
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:26,171
Yes...

1014
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:29,254
...but 10 hours ago.

1015
01:15:29,582 --> 01:15:32,938
There's no bloody way
l'm three months pregnant.

1016
01:15:33,102 --> 01:15:33,898
Well, doctor...

1017
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,853
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus.

1018
01:15:40,422 --> 01:15:41,252
l want to see it.

1019
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:43,180
Don't think that's a good idea.

1020
01:15:44,942 --> 01:15:47,661
David, l want to see it.

1021
01:15:47,942 --> 01:15:49,091
Now, doctor....

1022
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:52,935
l want to see it.

1023
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,335
l want it out of me.

1024
01:15:55,582 --> 01:15:57,095
We don't have the personnel...

1025
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,651
...to perform a procedure like that.

1026
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,574
-Our best option--
-l want it out.

1027
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:02,697
Put you back into...

1028
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:04,693
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.

1029
01:16:04,862 --> 01:16:07,057
Please, get it out of me.

1030
01:16:07,382 --> 01:16:08,735
Get it out of me!

1031
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,057
Please.

1032
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:15,174
lt must be very painful.

1033
01:16:16,022 --> 01:16:18,058
Here, let me give you something.

1034
01:16:21,902 --> 01:16:23,494
That's it. There, there.

1035
01:16:29,662 --> 01:16:32,130
Someone will be along shortly...

1036
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:34,697
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck.

1037
01:16:38,822 --> 01:16:40,972
lt must feel
like your God abandoned you.

1038
01:16:41,582 --> 01:16:42,697
What?

1039
01:16:42,862 --> 01:16:43,612
To lose...

1040
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:48,298
...Dr. Holloway after your father died
under such similar circumstances.

1041
01:16:48,862 --> 01:16:50,853
What was it that killed him?

1042
01:16:51,582 --> 01:16:52,981
Ebola?

1043
01:16:57,182 --> 01:16:59,821
How do you--? How do you know that?

1044
01:17:00,902 --> 01:17:02,620
l watched your dreams.

1045
01:17:24,262 --> 01:17:25,297
Dr. Shaw?

1046
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:27,657
We're here to put you...

1047
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:31,053
...in an anti-contamination suit,
take you back to Cryo Deck...

1048
01:17:31,222 --> 01:17:32,780
...go to beddy-byes.

1049
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:34,855
Dr. Shaw?

1050
01:17:36,302 --> 01:17:37,701
She's doped. Prepare her.

1051
01:18:06,502 --> 01:18:10,541
Emergency procedures initiated.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury.

1052
01:18:11,222 --> 01:18:13,053
l need a Caesarean.

1053
01:18:13,582 --> 01:18:15,652
Error. This Med-Pod is calibrated for male...

1054
01:18:15,822 --> 01:18:17,335
...patients and does not offer...

1055
01:18:17,502 --> 01:18:20,300
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...

1056
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:21,417
...elsewhere.

1057
01:18:23,702 --> 01:18:24,418
Surgery.

1058
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:26,061
Abdominal.

1059
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:27,458
Penetrating...

1060
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:28,896
...injuries.

1061
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:30,740
Foreign body.

1062
01:18:31,022 --> 01:18:32,057
lnitiate.

1063
01:18:34,622 --> 01:18:36,419
Surgical procedure to begin.

1064
01:19:16,222 --> 01:19:17,211
Running diagnostics.

1065
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:21,896
Oh, come on.

1066
01:19:23,422 --> 01:19:25,572
Get it out! Come on!

1067
01:19:25,982 --> 01:19:26,653
Please!

1068
01:19:29,862 --> 01:19:31,136
Oh, God!

1069
01:19:33,262 --> 01:19:35,014
-Come on!
-lnitiating anesthetics.

1070
01:19:36,142 --> 01:19:36,779
Please!

1071
01:19:43,102 --> 01:19:44,899
Commence surgical procedure.

1072
01:20:24,182 --> 01:20:25,092
Oh, God.

1073
01:20:28,582 --> 01:20:29,219
Oh, God!

1074
01:20:29,382 --> 01:20:30,701
Oh, God!

1075
01:20:48,462 --> 01:20:50,054
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1076
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,490
Oh, my God!

1077
01:21:07,582 --> 01:21:08,697
Come on!

1078
01:21:33,862 --> 01:21:34,499
Bridge...

1079
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:36,175
...to hangar. This is the captain.

1080
01:21:36,342 --> 01:21:38,219
-Yes, captain.
-Can you see what l see?

1081
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:40,373
Fifield's monitorjust popped up.

1082
01:21:40,782 --> 01:21:42,534
What? Where?

1083
01:21:42,702 --> 01:21:45,011
According to what l'm looking at,
it's outside...

1084
01:21:45,182 --> 01:21:46,331
...the goddamn ship.

1085
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:47,817
Barnes, open the door!

1086
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:49,893
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.

1087
01:21:50,782 --> 01:21:51,453
Fifield?

1088
01:22:03,262 --> 01:22:04,456
Wait a second.

1089
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,138
Hey, Wallace.

1090
01:22:14,302 --> 01:22:15,496
Take a look at this.

1091
01:22:20,942 --> 01:22:21,419
Fifield?

1092
01:22:24,302 --> 01:22:26,179
What the hell is going on down there?

1093
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:40,571
l'm coming down there.

1094
01:22:40,742 --> 01:22:41,891
Chance, you're suiting up.

1095
01:22:42,062 --> 01:22:43,654
-Come on.
-Don't let it on the ship!

1096
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:58,614
Take him out!

1097
01:22:59,462 --> 01:22:59,894
Got him!

1098
01:23:02,222 --> 01:23:02,813
Do it!

1099
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:08,578
-You ready, Chance?
-Yes.

1100
01:23:11,462 --> 01:23:12,292
Come on!

1101
01:23:12,462 --> 01:23:13,577
Get in the rover!

1102
01:23:14,462 --> 01:23:15,656
We gotta get out of here!

1103
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:23,338
Go!

1104
01:23:53,582 --> 01:23:54,810
What is that?

1105
01:24:28,782 --> 01:24:30,852
You've been asleep.

1106
01:24:31,022 --> 01:24:33,582
You were on the ship all this time. Why?

1107
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:36,381
Well, l....

1108
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:38,339
l have a few days of life left in me.

1109
01:24:39,502 --> 01:24:40,730
l didn't wanna waste them...

1110
01:24:40,902 --> 01:24:43,018
...until you could deliver
what you promised.

1111
01:24:44,142 --> 01:24:45,655
To meet my maker.

1112
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:47,016
There we are, sir.

1113
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,219
-Nice and clean.
-Haven't you told him they're all gone?

1114
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:54,779
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

1115
01:24:55,022 --> 01:24:56,614
One of them is still alive.

1116
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,139
We're on our way to see him now.

1117
01:24:59,422 --> 01:25:00,457
What?

1118
01:25:00,782 --> 01:25:02,056
Turn me around.

1119
01:25:02,702 --> 01:25:07,332
You convinced me that...

1120
01:25:08,822 --> 01:25:10,892
...if these things made us...

1121
01:25:12,102 --> 01:25:14,536
...then surely they could save us.

1122
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:16,092
My stick, please.

1123
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:22,738
Well, save me, anyway.

1124
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:25,138
Save you from what?

1125
01:25:25,742 --> 01:25:27,141
Death, of course.

1126
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,457
Stand me up.

1127
01:25:32,742 --> 01:25:33,697
l'm all right.

1128
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:35,617
l'm all right.

1129
01:25:36,582 --> 01:25:37,731
Yes, sir.

1130
01:25:37,942 --> 01:25:39,091
But you don't understand.

1131
01:25:39,782 --> 01:25:41,101
You don't know.

1132
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:43,935
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...

1133
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:46,058
...what we thought they were.

1134
01:25:46,222 --> 01:25:47,337
l was wrong.

1135
01:25:47,502 --> 01:25:48,696
We were so wrong.

1136
01:25:49,222 --> 01:25:50,541
Charlie....

1137
01:25:51,182 --> 01:25:53,252
Dr. Holloway's dead.

1138
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:56,453
We must leave!

1139
01:25:56,942 --> 01:25:58,819
And what would Charlie do...

1140
01:25:59,102 --> 01:26:03,778
...now that we're so close...

1141
01:26:04,062 --> 01:26:07,293
...to answering
the most meaningful questions...

1142
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:08,941
...ever asked by mankind?

1143
01:26:10,262 --> 01:26:11,900
How can you leave without...

1144
01:26:12,062 --> 01:26:13,939
...knowing what they are?

1145
01:26:20,702 --> 01:26:22,693
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

1146
01:26:57,302 --> 01:26:59,941
Okay. Okay.

1147
01:27:18,502 --> 01:27:19,821
Come in.

1148
01:27:26,702 --> 01:27:28,613
Where the hell are you going, doc?

1149
01:27:28,942 --> 01:27:30,853
You know what this place is?

1150
01:27:31,262 --> 01:27:34,811
Those Engineers? This ain't their home.

1151
01:27:36,182 --> 01:27:38,491
lt's an installation.
Maybe even military.

1152
01:27:39,022 --> 01:27:41,616
They put it out here
because they're not stupid enough...

1153
01:27:41,782 --> 01:27:44,899
...to make weapons of mass destruction
on their own doorstep.

1154
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:48,932
That's what all that shit is
in those vases.

1155
01:27:49,342 --> 01:27:50,491
They made it here.

1156
01:27:50,662 --> 01:27:54,575
lt got out, it turned on them. The end.

1157
01:27:56,462 --> 01:27:58,498
lt's time for us to go home.

1158
01:27:59,022 --> 01:28:00,774
One of them is still alive.

1159
01:28:05,182 --> 01:28:07,616
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

1160
01:28:10,942 --> 01:28:12,534
l don't care.

1161
01:28:14,382 --> 01:28:15,451
Right.

1162
01:28:16,222 --> 01:28:18,053
All you do is fly the ship.

1163
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:19,497
That's right.

1164
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:23,132
But you must care
about something, captain.

1165
01:28:25,382 --> 01:28:28,021
lf you didn't, why are you here?

1166
01:28:30,862 --> 01:28:32,295
How about this?

1167
01:28:34,182 --> 01:28:36,412
No matter what happens down there...

1168
01:28:37,622 --> 01:28:39,977
...l can't bring none of that shit
back home with us.

1169
01:28:40,142 --> 01:28:41,416
Can't let it happen.

1170
01:28:42,822 --> 01:28:44,141
l'll do whatever l have to...

1171
01:28:44,302 --> 01:28:45,974
...to see that it doesn't.

1172
01:28:47,782 --> 01:28:49,215
Make sure you do, captain.

1173
01:29:04,142 --> 01:29:06,178
So you came after all.

1174
01:29:06,462 --> 01:29:07,941
l thought you wanted me to.

1175
01:29:08,222 --> 01:29:10,577
After all your attempts
to stop me from coming here...

1176
01:29:10,742 --> 01:29:12,141
...l'm surprised to see you.

1177
01:29:12,862 --> 01:29:14,011
lt's all right. Leave us.

1178
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,935
Yes, sir.

1179
01:29:27,502 --> 01:29:28,139
lf you're...

1180
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:29,894
...going down there, you will die.

1181
01:29:32,902 --> 01:29:34,654
Very negative way of looking at things.

1182
01:29:36,782 --> 01:29:38,977
That's exactly why
you should have stayed at home.

1183
01:29:39,502 --> 01:29:42,380
Did you really think l was gonna
sit in a boardroom for years...

1184
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:44,134
...arguing over who was in charge...

1185
01:29:44,302 --> 01:29:47,499
...while you go look for some miracle
on some...

1186
01:29:47,662 --> 01:29:51,177
...godforsaken rock
in the middle of space?

1187
01:29:53,982 --> 01:29:55,620
A king has...

1188
01:29:55,782 --> 01:29:58,250
...his reign, and then he dies.

1189
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,455
lt's inevitable.

1190
01:30:02,822 --> 01:30:04,096
That...

1191
01:30:04,782 --> 01:30:06,693
...is the natural order of things.

1192
01:30:19,022 --> 01:30:20,341
Anything else?

1193
01:30:22,142 --> 01:30:23,461
No...

1194
01:30:24,702 --> 01:30:26,215
...Father.

1195
01:30:27,742 --> 01:30:28,572
That's it.

1196
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:42,660
l didn't think you had it in you.

1197
01:30:43,462 --> 01:30:44,099
Sorry.

1198
01:30:44,262 --> 01:30:46,537
Poor choice of words.

1199
01:30:47,782 --> 01:30:50,933
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.

1200
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:57,334
What happens when Weyland is not...

1201
01:30:57,502 --> 01:30:58,696
...around to program you?

1202
01:30:59,702 --> 01:31:01,260
l suppose l'll be free.

1203
01:31:02,142 --> 01:31:03,416
You want that?

1204
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:05,061
''Want''?

1205
01:31:05,222 --> 01:31:07,019
Not a concept l'm familiar with.

1206
01:31:07,302 --> 01:31:08,815
That being said...

1207
01:31:09,782 --> 01:31:11,738
...doesn't everyone
want their parents dead?

1208
01:31:13,662 --> 01:31:14,697
l didn't.

1209
01:31:15,742 --> 01:31:16,572
Dr. Shaw.

1210
01:31:18,142 --> 01:31:19,461
So pleased you could join us.

1211
01:31:33,702 --> 01:31:35,738
You can take your helmet off
if you like, sir.

1212
01:31:35,902 --> 01:31:36,618
What?

1213
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:39,171
The air is perfectly breathable.

1214
01:31:39,342 --> 01:31:40,457
Are you sure?

1215
01:31:40,622 --> 01:31:41,577
Positive.

1216
01:31:42,062 --> 01:31:46,658
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. lf it's in the air.

1217
01:31:47,222 --> 01:31:48,575
lt's not.

1218
01:31:48,862 --> 01:31:50,534
How do you know that?

1219
01:31:50,822 --> 01:31:51,811
Smells fine to me.

1220
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:55,661
-Shall we?
-Please.

1221
01:32:00,942 --> 01:32:02,614
The bridge is just up ahead.

1222
01:32:02,782 --> 01:32:03,817
What is this?

1223
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:06,694
lt's a cargo hold.

1224
01:32:15,342 --> 01:32:17,902
Janek? Are you seeing this?

1225
01:32:19,142 --> 01:32:20,291
How many is there, Shaw?

1226
01:32:20,462 --> 01:32:21,099
Thousands.

1227
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:24,339
What the hell?

1228
01:32:27,982 --> 01:32:29,893
Ravel, give me those schematics.

1229
01:32:32,622 --> 01:32:34,658
Putting it on the table now.

1230
01:32:35,982 --> 01:32:36,937
Strip away the dome.

1231
01:32:37,542 --> 01:32:40,215
lsolate that area, bring it up.

1232
01:32:40,382 --> 01:32:41,940
Bringing it up, captain.

1233
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:45,937
Enlarge that.

1234
01:32:47,982 --> 01:32:49,256
Rotate it.

1235
01:32:53,182 --> 01:32:54,661
That is a ship.

1236
01:32:55,582 --> 01:32:57,061
Jesus Christ.

1237
01:32:58,942 --> 01:33:00,898
lt's a goddamn ship.

1238
01:33:03,942 --> 01:33:06,536
A superior species, no doubt.

1239
01:33:08,742 --> 01:33:11,176
Their hypersleep chambers...

1240
01:33:11,342 --> 01:33:13,902
...will impress, l trust.

1241
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:23,179
So they...

1242
01:33:23,342 --> 01:33:26,971
-...were traveling somewhere.
-l've managed to work out the broad strokes.

1243
01:33:27,142 --> 01:33:29,895
lt's fairly evident
they were in the process of leaving...

1244
01:33:31,782 --> 01:33:33,852
...before things went to pot.

1245
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:35,461
Leaving to go where?

1246
01:33:37,262 --> 01:33:37,899
Earth.

1247
01:33:39,182 --> 01:33:39,898
Why?

1248
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:42,893
Sometimes to create...

1249
01:33:43,182 --> 01:33:44,900
...one must first destroy.

1250
01:33:47,022 --> 01:33:48,296
Where is he, David?

1251
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:50,531
This way, sir.

1252
01:33:56,702 --> 01:33:58,055
Are you sure he's alive?

1253
01:33:59,742 --> 01:34:00,777
Absolutely.

1254
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:06,415
And you can speak to him?

1255
01:34:06,702 --> 01:34:08,135
l believe l can.

1256
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:44,455
l'm all right, l'm all right.

1257
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:47,450
Speak to him, David.

1258
01:34:48,662 --> 01:34:50,380
Tell him we came, just like he asked.

1259
01:34:50,542 --> 01:34:51,657
Ask where they're from.

1260
01:34:52,262 --> 01:34:53,092
What are you doing?

1261
01:34:53,262 --> 01:34:54,854
Ask him what's in his cargo.

1262
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:55,818
lt killed his people.

1263
01:34:55,982 --> 01:34:57,051
Shaw, enough.

1264
01:34:57,342 --> 01:34:59,014
-David.
-You made it here...

1265
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:02,062
...and it was meant for us. Why?

1266
01:35:02,222 --> 01:35:03,974
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up.

1267
01:35:06,062 --> 01:35:07,131
l need to know why!

1268
01:35:07,302 --> 01:35:08,940
What did we do wrong? Why do you...

1269
01:35:09,102 --> 01:35:10,501
-...hate us?
-She opens her...

1270
01:35:10,662 --> 01:35:11,651
...mouth again, shoot her.

1271
01:35:11,822 --> 01:35:13,653
David, continue. Tell him why l came.

1272
01:35:33,702 --> 01:35:34,452
No!

1273
01:35:40,302 --> 01:35:41,257
Ford! Move!

1274
01:35:59,622 --> 01:36:03,217
There's nothing.

1275
01:36:08,142 --> 01:36:09,860
l know.

1276
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:13,375
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

1277
01:36:19,582 --> 01:36:21,095
Time to go home.

1278
01:36:33,982 --> 01:36:36,940
Mr. Chance, take us home.

1279
01:37:46,982 --> 01:37:47,812
Oh, no!

1280
01:37:55,342 --> 01:37:56,297
Hey, cap.

1281
01:37:56,822 --> 01:37:57,857
What the hell was that?

1282
01:38:40,302 --> 01:38:41,052
Prometheus!

1283
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:42,531
Come in!

1284
01:38:43,342 --> 01:38:44,536
Shaw, is that you?

1285
01:38:44,702 --> 01:38:45,418
Copy.

1286
01:38:45,582 --> 01:38:46,219
Janek...

1287
01:38:46,382 --> 01:38:47,337
...listen to me.

1288
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,416
This ship is taking off!

1289
01:38:49,582 --> 01:38:51,140
-What?
-What is she talking about?

1290
01:38:51,302 --> 01:38:52,781
You can't let it leave!

1291
01:38:53,062 --> 01:38:54,051
You have to stop it!

1292
01:38:54,382 --> 01:38:56,896
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.

1293
01:38:57,382 --> 01:38:59,338
Janek, if you don't stop it...

1294
01:38:59,502 --> 01:39:01,254
...there won't be any home to go back to.

1295
01:39:03,182 --> 01:39:05,696
lt's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.

1296
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:08,257
-Shaw, this is not a warship.
-l know.

1297
01:39:08,422 --> 01:39:09,172
Let's go.

1298
01:39:09,342 --> 01:39:10,536
l know that.

1299
01:39:11,182 --> 01:39:12,900
But you must do it.

1300
01:39:13,422 --> 01:39:15,014
Captain, let's go!

1301
01:39:15,182 --> 01:39:17,173
Janek, please believe me! Please!

1302
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:34,531
l told you to get this ship going.

1303
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:35,498
Mr. Ravel.

1304
01:39:35,662 --> 01:39:36,936
Warm up the ion propulsion.

1305
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:38,854
-What are you talking about?
-Sir.

1306
01:39:39,022 --> 01:39:40,614
Burning ion in the atmosphere--

1307
01:39:40,782 --> 01:39:43,740
-Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
-What are you doing?

1308
01:39:43,902 --> 01:39:45,574
This is my ship. l'm telling you...

1309
01:39:45,742 --> 01:39:46,777
...to take us home!

1310
01:39:46,942 --> 01:39:48,375
Vickers, l'll eject your module onto...

1311
01:39:48,542 --> 01:39:50,214
...that surface. Two years of life.

1312
01:39:50,382 --> 01:39:52,293
You want it, or you want to stay with me?

1313
01:39:53,182 --> 01:39:54,456
You got 40 seconds to get...

1314
01:39:54,622 --> 01:39:55,577
...to the escape pod.

1315
01:39:55,742 --> 01:39:56,777
You're crazy.

1316
01:39:56,942 --> 01:39:57,658
Gentlemen...

1317
01:39:58,222 --> 01:39:59,814
...l can handle this myself.

1318
01:40:00,302 --> 01:40:01,974
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.

1319
01:40:02,822 --> 01:40:04,141
All due respect, captain.

1320
01:40:04,302 --> 01:40:07,419
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

1321
01:40:23,022 --> 01:40:27,015
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

1322
01:40:27,182 --> 01:40:29,332
lf you think this means the bet's off...

1323
01:40:30,622 --> 01:40:31,816
...you're wrong.

1324
01:40:33,382 --> 01:40:35,657
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

1325
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:37,813
All right, get us as close as we can.

1326
01:40:37,982 --> 01:40:39,813
Only got one shot at this.

1327
01:40:52,382 --> 01:40:53,019
Lifeboats away!

1328
01:40:58,062 --> 01:40:58,972
Twenty seconds...

1329
01:40:59,142 --> 01:41:00,097
...to evacuate.

1330
01:41:07,662 --> 01:41:09,380
-Countdown initiated.
-lon propulsion...

1331
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:10,213
...is online.

1332
01:41:10,582 --> 01:41:11,253
Ten.

1333
01:41:11,662 --> 01:41:12,299
Nine.

1334
01:41:12,582 --> 01:41:13,412
Come on!

1335
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:14,537
Eight.

1336
01:41:26,302 --> 01:41:27,576
-Three.
-Let's do this.

1337
01:41:27,742 --> 01:41:28,572
Two.

1338
01:41:31,782 --> 01:41:32,612
lmpact imminent.

1339
01:41:32,782 --> 01:41:34,135
Hands off!

1340
01:42:09,502 --> 01:42:10,218
Oh, God.

1341
01:42:55,822 --> 01:42:56,777
No. No.

1342
01:42:56,942 --> 01:42:57,977
No! No! No!

1343
01:43:13,582 --> 01:43:14,617
Oh, God.

1344
01:43:30,382 --> 01:43:33,533
Warning: You have two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

1345
01:44:19,982 --> 01:44:23,691
Warning: You have 30 seconds
of oxygen remaining.

1346
01:44:36,702 --> 01:44:37,771
Airlock sealed.

1347
01:44:39,342 --> 01:44:41,731
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.

1348
01:45:56,502 --> 01:45:58,379
Elizabeth, are you there?

1349
01:45:58,862 --> 01:46:00,011
This is David.

1350
01:46:01,182 --> 01:46:03,571
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, l'm here.

1351
01:46:03,862 --> 01:46:06,057
You need to get out immediately.

1352
01:46:06,342 --> 01:46:08,173
He's coming for you.

1353
01:46:08,382 --> 01:46:09,371
Who's coming?

1354
01:46:09,902 --> 01:46:10,971
Airlock breach.

1355
01:46:19,222 --> 01:46:20,211
Die!

1356
01:47:42,262 --> 01:47:44,617
l'm so sorry.

1357
01:47:46,022 --> 01:47:47,819
Oh, God.

1358
01:47:48,422 --> 01:47:49,741
l'm sorry.

1359
01:47:49,902 --> 01:47:53,212
l'm sorry, Charlie, l can't do it.

1360
01:47:53,382 --> 01:47:56,419
l can't do it anymore.

1361
01:47:59,662 --> 01:48:01,095
Elizabeth.

1362
01:48:02,982 --> 01:48:04,131
Are you there?

1363
01:48:08,462 --> 01:48:09,895
Dr. Shaw...

1364
01:48:10,582 --> 01:48:11,810
...can you hear me?

1365
01:48:13,062 --> 01:48:14,256
Yes.

1366
01:48:15,662 --> 01:48:17,732
Yes, l can hear you.

1367
01:48:18,262 --> 01:48:20,059
l was afraid you were dead.

1368
01:48:21,742 --> 01:48:24,575
You have no idea what afraid is.

1369
01:48:25,382 --> 01:48:28,055
l know we've had our differences...

1370
01:48:29,422 --> 01:48:30,821
...but, please...

1371
01:48:31,702 --> 01:48:33,897
...l need to ask you for your help.

1372
01:48:34,062 --> 01:48:36,496
Why the hell would l help you?

1373
01:48:38,182 --> 01:48:41,891
Because, without me,
you'll never leave this place.

1374
01:48:42,542 --> 01:48:45,579
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

1375
01:48:46,022 --> 01:48:47,978
lt's not the only ship.

1376
01:48:49,782 --> 01:48:51,773
There are many others.

1377
01:48:53,102 --> 01:48:54,376
l can operate them.

1378
01:49:03,182 --> 01:49:04,535
Dr. Shaw?

1379
01:49:16,782 --> 01:49:17,976
Dr. Shaw!

1380
01:49:19,342 --> 01:49:20,457
Over here.

1381
01:49:25,942 --> 01:49:27,819
Where is my cross?

1382
01:49:28,302 --> 01:49:30,099
The pouch in my utility belt.

1383
01:49:48,102 --> 01:49:49,854
Even after all this...

1384
01:49:50,022 --> 01:49:51,978
...you still believe, don't you?

1385
01:49:52,782 --> 01:49:55,660
You said you could
understand their navigation...

1386
01:49:56,182 --> 01:49:57,376
...use their maps.

1387
01:49:59,302 --> 01:50:00,940
Yes, of course.

1388
01:50:01,102 --> 01:50:03,332
Once we get
to one of their other ships...

1389
01:50:03,502 --> 01:50:06,494
...finding a path to Earth
should be relatively straightforward.

1390
01:50:07,182 --> 01:50:10,015
l don't want to go back
to where we came from.

1391
01:50:11,782 --> 01:50:14,342
l want to go where they came from.

1392
01:50:15,662 --> 01:50:17,971
Do you think you can do that, David?

1393
01:50:21,702 --> 01:50:22,851
Yes.

1394
01:50:23,462 --> 01:50:25,259
l believe l can.

1395
01:50:34,222 --> 01:50:36,736
May l ask what you hope to achieve
by going there?

1396
01:50:37,382 --> 01:50:39,373
They created us.

1397
01:50:39,582 --> 01:50:41,061
Then they tried to kill us.

1398
01:50:41,582 --> 01:50:43,413
They changed their minds.

1399
01:50:44,942 --> 01:50:46,534
l deserve to know why.

1400
01:50:48,622 --> 01:50:50,180
The answer is irrelevant.

1401
01:50:51,182 --> 01:50:53,377
Does it matter why
they changed their minds?

1402
01:50:54,062 --> 01:50:55,177
Yes.

1403
01:50:56,462 --> 01:50:58,054
Yes, it does.

1404
01:50:59,022 --> 01:51:00,137
l don't understand.

1405
01:51:01,582 --> 01:51:02,651
Well...

1406
01:51:04,622 --> 01:51:07,534
...l guess that's because
l'm a human being...

1407
01:51:07,702 --> 01:51:09,101
...and you're a robot.

1408
01:51:18,542 --> 01:51:19,452
l'm sorry.

1409
01:51:19,622 --> 01:51:20,771
lt's quite all right.

1410
01:51:35,342 --> 01:51:38,015
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.

1411
01:51:38,182 --> 01:51:39,092
The ship and her...

1412
01:51:39,262 --> 01:51:41,298
...entire crew are gone.

1413
01:51:41,502 --> 01:51:43,299
If you're receiving this transmission...

1414
01:51:43,462 --> 01:51:46,693
...make no attempt
to come to its point of origin.

1415
01:51:46,862 --> 01:51:50,901
There is only death here now,
and l'm leaving it behind.

1416
01:51:51,942 --> 01:51:53,660
lt is New Year's Day...

1417
01:51:53,822 --> 01:51:56,734
...the year of our Lord, 2094.

1418
01:51:57,622 --> 01:52:00,011
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...

1419
01:52:00,222 --> 01:52:03,020
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.

1420
01:52:03,502 --> 01:52:05,891
And l am still searching.
