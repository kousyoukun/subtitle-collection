Everybody better beware

Oh, oh, no

00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,469
Oh, hit the dirt, baby

Little shop
Little shop of horrors

38
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,306
Bop she-bop
You'll never stop the terror

39
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,351
Little shop
Little shop of horrors

40
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,729
No, oh, oh, no
Oh, oh, no

41
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:56,068
Oh, oh, no

42
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,285
MUSHNIK:
Seymour, what's going on down there?

43
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,537
Very little, Mr. Mushnik!

44
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,331
Uh.

45
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,214
- Until the weekend.

46
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,926
And at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions...

47
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,845
...concerning last Thursday's
total eclipse of the sun...

48
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,558
...an unprecedented astrological
phenomenon which has baffled the nation.

49
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:50,247
Ah! So, she finally decides to come to work!

50
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,582
Uh, good morning, Mr. Mushnik.

51
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,003
What morning? It's almost closing time.
Not that we had a customer.

52
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,882
Seymour, what in the name of God
is going on down there?

53
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,553
Unh, Audrey, would you go down
and see what he's...

54
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,806
Audrey. Audrey,
where did you get that shiner?

55
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,517
Uh... Uh, shiner?

56
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,604
Audrey, that greasy boyfriend of yours
is beating up on you again?

57
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,898
Look, I know it's none of my business...

58
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,235
...but I'm beginning to think
he's maybe not such a nice boy.

59
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,030
I got these pots unloaded for you, Mr...

60
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,991
Seymour, look what you've done to the inventory!

61
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,076
Don't yell at Seymour, Mr. Mushnik.

62
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,413
- Hi, Audrey. You look radiant today.
- Oh.

63
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,749
Is that new eye makeup?

64
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,042
Uh...

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,879
I'll help him clean it up
before any of the customers get here.

66
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,048
That should give you plenty of time.

67
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:46,011
Oh, God, what an existence I got.
Misfit employees, bums on the sidewalk...

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,931
...business is lousy. My life is a living hell!

69
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,683
Hey, you. Urchins!

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,645
Shoo! Shoo! Move! Move!

71
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,565
Move! Go away! No loitering!

72
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,734
Man, I wasn't loitering. Were you, Crystal?

73
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,819
Not me, Ronette. Were you, Chiffon?

74
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,696
You ought to be in school!

75
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,239
Yeah, well we on a split shift.

76
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,659
Right! We went to school until fifth grade,
then we split.

77
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,371
So? How do you intend to better yourselves?

78
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,834
Better ourselves? You heard what he said?
Better ourselves?

79
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:22,297
Mister, when you're from Skid Row,
ain't no such thing.

80
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:32,557
♫ Alarm goes off at 7

81
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:38,188
And you start uptown

82
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,607
You put in your eight hours

83
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,192
For the powers

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,655
That have always been

85
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,865
Sing it, child.

86
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:56,915
'Til it's 5 p.m.

87
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,459
Then you go

88
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,337
Downtown
Where the folks are broke

89
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,715
You go downtown
Where your life's a joke

90
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,219
You go downtown
Where you buy your token

91
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,847
You go

92
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:18,562
Home to Skid Row

93
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,813
Yes you go

94
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,275
- Downtown
- Where the cabs don't stop

95
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,695
- Downtown
- Where the food is slop

96
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:32,242
Downtown
Where the hop-heads flop in the snow

97
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,913
Down on Skid Row

98
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,292
Uptown you cater to a million jerks

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,712
Uptown you're messengers
And mailroom clerks

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,923
Eating all your lunches at the hot-dog carts

101
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,469
The bosses take your money
And they break your hearts

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,972
And uptown you cater to a million whores

103
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,225
You disinfect terrazzo on their bathroom floors

104
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,520
The jobs are really menial
You make no bread

105
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,107
- And then at 5:00 you head
- By subway

106
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,527
Downtown
Where the guys are drips

107
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,864
- Downtown
- Where they rip your slips

108
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:16,328
- Downtown
- Where relationships are no go

109
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:26,713
- Down on Skid Row
- Down on Skid Row

110
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,926
Down on Skid Row

111
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,764
Poor
All my life I've always been poor

112
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,100
I keep askin' God what I'm for

113
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,812
And he tells me Gee, I'm not sure

114
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,898
Sweep that floor, kid!

115
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,069
Oh!
I started life as an orphan

116
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,615
A child of the street
Here on Skid Row

117
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,828
He took me in, gave me shelter
A bed, crust of bread and a job

118
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,040
Treats me like dirt
Calls me a slob

119
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,626
Which I am

120
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,088
So I live

121
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,589
Downtown

122
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,676
That's your home address You live

123
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,261
Downtown

124
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,055
When your life's a mess
You live

125
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,974
Downtown

126
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:24,729
Where depression's just status quo

127
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,232
Down on Skid Row

128
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,653
Someone show me a way to get outta here

129
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:36,157
'Cause I constantly pray I'll get outta here

130
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:40,495
Please won't somebody say I'll get outta here

131
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,416
Someone give me my shot
Or I'll rot here

132
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,628
- Downtown, there's no rules for us
- Show me how and I will, I'll get outta here

133
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:53,091
- Downtown, 'cause it's dangerous
- I'll start climbin' up hill and get outta here

134
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,596
- Downtown, where the rainbow'sjust a no-show
- Someone tell me I still could get outta here

135
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,057
Someone tell lady luck that I'm stuck here

136
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,603
Gee it sure would be swell to get out of here

137
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,647
Bid the gutter farewell and get outta here

138
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,942
I'd move heaven and hell to get outta Skid

139
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,404
I'd do I-don't-know-what to get outta Skid

140
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,991
But a hell of a lot to get outta Skid

141
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,411
People tell me there's not a way outta Skid

142
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:28,585
But believe me I gotta get outta Skid Row

143
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,492
Six o'clock and we haven't sold
so much as a fern.

144
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,743
- All right!
- Aah.

145
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,245
That's it! Forget it.
Don't bother coming in tomorrow.

146
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,081
- Aah. You don't mean...
- You can't...

147
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,166
Wha...? What don't I mean?
I'm through. Forget it.

148
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,376
- Kaput.
- You can't.

149
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,588
Kaput! Extinct. I'm closing
this God-and-customer-forsaken place.

150
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,465
- Ah.
- Mr. Mushnik...

151
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,301
...forgive me for saying so, sir,
but has it ever occurred to you...

152
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,305
...that maybe what the firm needs
is to move in a new direction?

153
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,392
Uh, what Seymour's trying to say is...

154
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,520
Uh, Seymour,
why don't you run downstairs and bring up...

155
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,483
...that strange and interesting new plant
you've been working on?

156
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,652
You see, Mr. Mushnik...

157
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,780
...some of those exotic plants
Seymour's been tinkering around with...

158
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,074
...are really unusual.

159
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,495
And we thought maybe some of
those strange and interesting new plants...

160
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,625
...prominently displayed and advertised,
would attract business.

161
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,965
I'm afraid it isn't feeling very well today.

162
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,385
There. Now, isn't that bizarre?

163
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,928
At least.

164
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,597
What kind of a weirdo plant is that, Seymour?

165
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,100
I don't know.
I think it's some kind of flytrap...

166
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,853
...but I haven't been able to identify it
in any of my books.

167
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,982
I gave it my own name though.
I call it an Audrey II.

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,443
- After me?
- I hope you don't mind.

169
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,197
You see, sir, if you were to put a strange
and interesting plant like this...

170
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,867
...here in the window, then maybe...

171
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,244
Maybe what? Maybe what?

172
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,621
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

173
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,957
Just because you put a strange
and interesting plant...

174
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,751
...in the window, people don't suddenly...

175
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,797
Excuse me. I couldn't help noticing
that strange and interesting plant.

176
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,468
- What is it?
- It's an Audrey II.

177
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,596
- I've never seen anything like it before.
- No one has.

178
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,014
Where did you get it?

179
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,559
Well...

180
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,270
...you remember that total eclipse of the sun
about a week ago?

181
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,855
♫ Da-doo

182
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,566
I was walking in the wholesale
flower district that day.

183
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,776
CHORUS:
Shoop da-doo

184
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,070
And I passed by this place
where this old Chinese man...

185
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,697
CHORUS:
Chang da-doo

186
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,742
He sometimes sells
me weird and exotic cuttings...

187
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,368
Snip da-doo

188
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,580
Because he knows, you see,
that strange plants are my hobby.

189
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,956
Da-da-da da-da da-doo

190
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,210
SEYMOUR:
He didn't have anything unusual there that day.

191
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,669
Nope, da-doo

192
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,923
SEYMOUR:
So I was just about to, you know, walk on by.

193
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,591
♫ Good for you

194
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,427
Ooh, ooh, she-shoo-bop
Shoo-bop

195
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,431
When suddenly,
and without warning, there was this:

196
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,601
CHORUS:
Total eclipse of the sun

197
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,311
SEYMOUR:
It got very dark.

198
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,440
And there was this strange humming sound
like something from another world.

199
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,650
CHORUS:
Da-doo

200
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,861
And when the light came back
this weird plant was just sitting there.

201
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,071
CHORUS:
Oops-ee-doo

202
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,907
SEYMOUR:
Just, you know, stuck in, among the zinnias.

203
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,700
Audrey II

204
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,870
SEYMOUR:
I could have sworn it hadn't been there before.

205
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,833
But the old Chinese man sold it to me anyways...

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,543
...for a dollar ninety-five.

207
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,716
Sha la la, la la la, la la la
Doo

208
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,809
Well, that's an unusual story,
and a fascinating plant.

209
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,523
Oh, while I'm here,
I might as well take $50 worth of roses.

210
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,983
Fifty dollars?

211
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,528
Can you break a hundred?

212
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,573
A hundred? Uh, no.

213
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,033
Well, then I'll just have to take
twice as many, won't I?

214
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,578
- Twice as many?
- Twice as many?

215
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,454
Twice as many!

216
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,081
Twice as many.

217
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,418
That plant in the window, it's simply amazing!

218
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,671
That plant in the window,
wherever did you get it?

219
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,216
- Look, there it is, Marge.
- Oh, my gosh, it's peculiar.

220
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,443
Aah.

221
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,989
Thank you!
Thank you very much, sir! Thank you!

222
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,824
Thank you! Come again!

223
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,035
Come and look at the weirdo plant some more!

224
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,079
It's just gonna get bigger
and more interesting. Ha-ha-ha.

225
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,585
What, what, what?
Just don't stand there! Quick, quick!

226
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,837
Put the plant back in the...
Oh, what did you call it?

227
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,047
Audrey II.

228
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,175
Put that Audrey II back in the window
where the passersby can see it.

229
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,635
Oh, my God!

230
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,179
I never thought this could happen!
Oh, my children...

231
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,556
...I'm taking us all out to dinner tonight!

232
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:38,519
Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Mushnik,
but I have a date.

233
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,063
With that same "nogoodnik"?

234
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,233
I'm telling you, Audrey, you don't need
a date with him. You need major medical.

235
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:49,447
He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik, but he...
He makes good money.

236
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,282
Besides...

237
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,952
...he's the only fellow I got.

238
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,121
Enjoy dinner. Good night, Seymour.

239
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,457
SEYMOUR:
Good night, Audrey.

240
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,876
Poor girl.

241
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,711
Are we still going out?

242
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,303
You're not going anywhere, Krelborn.

243
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,264
You're staying right here
and taking care of that sick plant!

244
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,268
I told you it's been giving me trouble.
The Audrey II is not a healthy girl.

245
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,105
Strictly between us, neither is the Audrey I.

246
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,648
If only I knew what breed it was.

247
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,442
Who cares what breed it is?
Look what it's done for business.

248
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,069
- I know.
- So work, Seymour.

249
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,571
Nurse this plant back to health.
I'm counting on you.

250
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,781
- I know.
- You do?

251
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,909
- I do.
- So fix. Good night.

252
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,992
Aw, Twoey, I don't know
what else I can do for you.

253
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,496
Are you sickly, little plant,
or are you just plain stubborn?

254
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,749
What is it you want?

255
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,084
What is it you need?

256
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,837
♫ I've given you sunshine

257
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,465
I've given you dirt

258
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,925
You've given me nothin'

259
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,511
But heartache and hurt

260
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,431
I'm beggin' you sweetly

261
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,350
I'm down on my knees

262
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,394
Oh, please

263
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,105
Grow for me

264
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,733
I've given you plant food

265
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,235
And water to sip

266
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,821
I've given you potash

267
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,491
You've given me zip

268
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,118
Oh, God how I mist you

269
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,288
Oh, pod how you tease

270
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,207
Now please

271
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,918
Grow for me

272
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,171
I've given you southern exposure

273
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,090
To get you to thrive

274
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,218
I've pinched you back hard
Like I'm supposed to

275
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,261
You're barely alive

276
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:23,142
I've tried you at levels of moisture
From desert to mud

277
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,895
I've given you grow-lights
And mineral supplements

278
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,897
What do you want from me?
Blood?

279
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,235
Ow! Damn roses. Damn thorns.

280

Looks like you're not happy
'Less I open a vein

283
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,565
Ugh.

284
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,568
I'll give you a few drops

285
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,613
If that'll appease

286
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,675

Skid Row radio

00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,390
You're listening
to radio station WSKID, home of the hits.

292
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,935
In just a few minutes we'll bring you
Wink Wilkinson's Weird World...

293
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,605
...the show that talks to wonderful people
who bring in their weird things.

294
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,066
But first, the weather.

295
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,651
Thank you very much, Tom.

296
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,280
The weather today will be partly cloudy
with a chance of rain. Sorry about that.

297
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,865
The high temperature
will be in the low 50s tonight...

298
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,534
...so get out those electric blankets.

299
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,869
Tomorrow we'll start off with morning haze...

300
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,872
- Excuse me. I was told to come...
- Yeah, you're next.

301
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,083
MAN:
High tomorrow should be in the low 70s...

302
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,876
...with the low in the high 60s.

303
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,879
In the suburbs, the sun should be out
through most of the day...

304
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,048
...except for some cloudy patches
in the evening...

305
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,217
...but I don't think it'll affect your barbecue.

306
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,846
The barometer reading should be 21.6.
The wind will be about...

307
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,056
...uh, I'd say 12 miles per hour...

308
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,434
...so watch it out there on those boats.

309
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,313
The sun will be rising tomorrow
at about 7:17 a. M...

310
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,567
...and it should be setting around 6:29 p.m.,
but check me if I'm wrong.

311
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,652
A cold front is moving in from the southwest.

312
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,404
But it should brighten up by noon.

313
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,574
The weekend should be mild.
For you average-mean-temperature fans...

314
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,494
...the average mean temperature
for the season is 69 degrees, not too bad.

315
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,580
Thank you, and back to you.

316
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,625
MAN:
You're listening to radio station WSKID.

317
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,756
And now, Wink Wilkinson's Weird World,
with your host, Wink Wilkinson.

318
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,136
Hi everybody! It's Weird Wink Wilkinson,
laughing and scratching at you.

319
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,429
How's everybody doing today?

320
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,431
I got a bit of a stiff neck.
Let me fix this up.

321
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,352
Ooh, that feels a lot better!
I got a great show for you today...

322
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,188
...with some wonderful weird stuff!

323
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,565
What are you doing here?

324
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,359
What? You... Please, lady, no!

325
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,819
Put your clothes back on!
You can't do this to me!

326
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,446
What if your husband were to walk in?

327
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,323
I'm here. I love your show...

328
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,450
...but I've got to kill you
with this machine gun.

329
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,537
Oh, you got me!

330
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,210
I feel... I feel so very weird!

331
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,254
Our first guest is a young man...

332
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,883
...you probably read about in the newspapers,
by the name of, um...

333
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,052
Seymour Krelborn. Is that correct?

334
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,138
Who has discovered a new breed of plant
hitherto unknown on this planet.

335
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,099
Let me play you down to your seat, Seymour.

336
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,895
Hello, Seymour!

337
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,772
Um...

338
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,399
Hello, Wink.

339
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,526
I wish you folks at home could see this.

340
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,238
Seymour, where did you get such a weird plant?

341
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,955
Well, you remember that total eclipse
of the sun about a week ago?

342
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,792
Thus we conclude
our interview with the young botanical...

343
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,544
- Mind if I call you a genius?
- Oh, hoo.

344
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,795
SEYMOUR:
Gosh, no!

345
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,840
The genius who's discovered
this amazing, unidentified plant.

346
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,385
I'd like to remind our listeners
that the Audrey II is on display...

347
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,595
...exclusively at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists.

348
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,972
- Shh!
- Am I late? Did I miss it?

349
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,266
- Mushnik's.
- Until next week...

350
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,768
- The address.
- This is Wilkinson saying...

351
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,146
- The address!
- Six days a week...

352
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,606
I said, mention the address!

353
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,275
♫ Skid Row radio

354
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,987
Ugh. Oh, well. It's still good advertising.

355
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,614
Seymour's first radio broadcast.

356
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,452
I wanted to hear it so bad.
I tried to be on time, but...

357
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,537
Don't tell me. You got tied up.

358
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,081
No, just handcuffed a little.

359
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,085
Girl. Hey, girl.

360
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,504
I don't know who this mess is
you been hanging out with...

361
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,298
...but he is hazardous to your health.

362
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,758
That's for sure. But I can't leave him.

363
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,011
- Why not?
- Oh, he'd get angry.

364
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,223
And if he does this to me when he likes me,
imagine what he'd do if he ever got mad.

365
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,518
So? Dump the chump.
Get another guy and let him protect you.

366
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,188
How about the little jerk with the glasses?

367
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,522
- Seymour?
- That's him.

368
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,816
Oh, we're just friends.

369
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,528
I don't even deserve a sweet, considerate...

370
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,490
...suddenly successful guy like Seymour.

371
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,075
That poor child
suffers from low self-image.

372
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,453
- You got a point.
- She got a problem.

373
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,584
♫ I know Seymour's the greatest

374
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:09,673
But I'm dating a semi-sadist

375
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,553
So I got a black eye
And my arm's in a cast

376
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,311
Still, that Seymour's a cutie

377
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:31,237
Well, if not, he's got inner beauty

378
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,323
And I dream of a place

379
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:40,913
Where we could be together at last

380
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,671
A matchbox of our own

381
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:53,926
A fence of real chain link

382
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,347
A grill out on the patio

383
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,017
Disposal in the sink

384
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,813
A washer and a dryer

385
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:10,651
And an ironing machine

386
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,904
In a tract house that we share

387
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,533
Somewhere that's green

388
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,838
He rakes and trims the grass

389
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:35,092
He loves to mow and weed

390
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,804
I cook like Betty Crocker

391
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,975
And I look like Donna Reed

392
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,104
There's plastic on the furniture

393
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,941
To keep it neat and clean

394
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,194
In the Pine-Sol scented air

395
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:59,783
Somewhere that's green

396
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:37,071
Somewhere that's green

397
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,574
Between our frozen dinner

398
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,953
And our bed-time: 9:15

399
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,749
We snuggle watching Lucy

400
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:54,838
On our big, enormous
Twelve-inch screen

401
00:27:55,006 --> 00:28:02,012
I'm his December Bride

402
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:08,185
He's father, he knows best

403
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,147
The kids play Howdy Doody

404
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:17,194
As the sun sets in the west

405
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,489
A picture out of

406
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:27,663
Better Homes and Gardens Magazine

407
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:39,258
Far from Skid Row

408
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,890
I dream we'll go

409
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:56,734
Somewhere that's

410
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,253
Green

411
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,779
♫ Poor Seymour pushed a broom

412
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,490
Nothing in his news but gloom and doom

413
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,242
Then he lit a fuse and give him room

414
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,454
He started an explosion
Holy cow

415
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,706
That thing went bang, kaboom

416
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,168
And he's havin' some fun now
Now

417
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,253
Some fun now
Hot damn

418
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,964
Ain't he havin' some fun now
Yes, ma'am

419
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,759
He's a havin' some fun now
Oh, boy

420
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,220
Ain't he havin' some fun now

421
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,606
All right!

422
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,321
Now! Some fun now
Sho 'nuff

423

Ain't he havin' some fun now Hot stuff

He's a havin' some fun now
Oh, boy

Ain't he havin' some fun now
Now

00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,833
Some fun now
Good God, good God

427
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,544
He's havin' some fun now
Oh, boy, oh, boy

00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,879
Yeah, he's a havin' some fun now
Oh, boy

Some fun now

431
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,441
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!

432
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,318
Hello?

433
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,487
Hello? Hold on.

434
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,823
Uh, yes, yes. Yes, Mrs. Shiva.

435
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,243
Uh, no, Mrs. Shiva. Right away, Mrs. Shiva.

436
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,204
- Seymour!
- I'd just like to pay for these, please.

437
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,582
MUSHNIK:
Seymour!

438
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,209
Did you send out the order for Mrs. Shiva?

439
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,712
Mrs. Shiva? I forgot!

440
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,547
You forgot?

441
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,090
You forgot!

442
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,509
Do you hear this, God? He forgot!

443
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,637
Are you listening, customers? He forgot!

444
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,390
Audrey, quick! We've got to do
an emergency arrangement.

445
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,975
Birthday? Wedding? Baby?

446
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,019
- Funeral.
- Hand me the lilies.

447
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,356
Mr. Mushnik's real mad at me, Audrey.
I keep forgetting things.

448
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,067
Scissors. You got a lot on your mind.

449
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,863
Mind? What mind? The Shivas are
our most important funereal account.

450
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,699
A big enormous family,
they're dropping off like flies!

451
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,745
Sometimes I think
Mr. Mushnik's too hard on you. Glue.

452
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,163
That's okay.

453
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,498
- After all, I owe him everything.
- Glitter.

454
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,336
He took me out of the Skid Row Home for Boys
when I was just a little tyke...

455
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:06,673
...gave me a warm place to stay,
floors to sweep, toilets to clean...

456
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,717
...and every other Sunday off.

457
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:13,305
You know, I think you ought
to raise your expectations, Seymour.

458
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,600
Now that you're getting successful, I mean.

459
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,686
It's clear you suffer from a low self-image.

460
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,356
And it's high time you get it fixed.

461
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,776
Why don't you go out
and do something nice for yourself like...

462
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,070
...buy some new clothes?

463
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,156
Oh, I'm a very bad shopper, Audrey.

464
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,201
I don't have good taste like you.

465
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,827
Oh.

466
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,164
Well, I could help you pick things out.

467
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,376
- You could?
- Sure.

468
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,920
You'd go shopping with me?

469
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,755
Sure.

470
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:51,301
You'd be seen with me in a public place
like a department store?

471
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,136
Sure.

472
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,389
Tonight?

473
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,808
Oh, I can't tonight. I got a date.

474
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,768
Again, this date?

475
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,061
Some date.

476
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,730
A date gives you a corsage,
not a multiple fracture.

477
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,025
I'm telling you, Audrey,
he's not a good, clean kind of boy.

478
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,402
He's a professional.

479
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,821
What kind of a professional
drives a motorcycle...

480
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,572
...and wears a black leather jacket?

481
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,666
♫ When I was younger, just a bad little kid

482
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,877
My momma noticed funny things I did

483
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,131
Like shootin' puppies with a BB gun

484
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,300
I'd poison guppies
And when I was done

485
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,346
I'd find a pussy cat and bash in its head

486
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,432
That's when my momma said

487
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,686
What did she say?

488
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,857
She said
My boy, I think someday

489
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,483
You'll find a way

490
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,319
To make your natural tendencies pay

491
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,781
- You'll be a dentist
- You'll be a dentist

492
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,951
- You have a talent for causing things pain
- Pain

493
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,288
- Son, be a dentist
- Son, be a dentist

494
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,875
- People will pay you to be inhumane
- That's inhumane

495
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,086
Your temperament's wrong for the priesthood

496
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,797
- And teaching would suit you still less
- Aah!

497
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,550
Son, be a dentist

498
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,719
You'll be a success

499
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,981
WOMAN:
Here he is folks, the leader of the plaque

500
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,983
Watch him suck up that gas
Oh, my God

501
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,321
He's a dentist and he'll never ever be any good

502
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,698
Who wants their teeth done
By the Marquis de Sade?

503
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,618
Oh, that hurts! Wait, I'm not numb.

504
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,163
Eh, shut up. Open wide, here I come!

505
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,626
- ♫ I am your dentist
- Goodness gracious

506
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,796
- And I enjoy the career that I picked
- You love it

507
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:54,049
I am your dentist

508
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,928
- And I get off on the pain I inflict
- You really love it

509
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,806
I thrill when I drill a bicuspid

510
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:05,268
It's swell though they tell me I'm maladjusted

511
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,816
- And though it may cause my patients distress
- No, no, no.

512
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,944
Somewhere
Somewhere in heaven above me

513
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,906
I know
I know that my momma's proud of me

514
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,033
Oh, Momma.

515
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,373
♫ 'Cause I'm a dentist

516
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,126
- And a success
- Aah!

517
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,421
Say, "Ahh."

518
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,883
Say, "Ahh."

519
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,928
Say, "Ahh!"

520
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,890
Now spit!

521
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,977
Excuse me, sir, you can't go in there right now.

522
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,063
Relax. You want some nitrous oxide?

523
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,274
- No thanks.
- Suit yourself.

524
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,654
We're closed.

525
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,782
- Well...
- Oh, it's all right, Seymour.

526
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,492
This is my date, my boyfriend.

527
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,454
Seymour, Orin Scrivello.

528
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,916
- D.D.S.
- Hey!

529
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,835
I know you. Sure, I saw you on the news.

530
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,173
I even know your name.
Now, let's see. It's, uh, Cecil. No, no, no.

531
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,759
- It's, uh, Cedric.
- No.

532
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,594
Give me a chance.

533
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,596
It's, uh, ahem...

534
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,474
- Simon?
- Seymour!

535
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,852
- Somebody talking to you?
- Oh, no. Excuse me.

536
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,270
Excuse me, what?

537
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,690
Excuse me, doctor.

538
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,944
That's better.

539
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,447
I know! Sure! You're the plant guy, right?

540
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,951
Well, hey! That means
it must be in there, huh?

541
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,870
Well! That is incredible.

542
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,624
- What do you call that thing?
- Audrey II.

543
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,168
Cute name. It's catchy.

544
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,587
Nice plant. Big.

545
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,215
Uh, shouldn't we be leaving now?

546
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,509
You're quite the little chatterbox tonight,
ain't you?

547
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,177
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry, what?

548
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,847
Sorry, doctor. Doctor. Sorry, doctor.

549
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,976
You've got to train them, huh, stud? Heh.

550
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,894
Listen, here's my card.

551
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,147
You ever need a root canal or anything
like that, give me a buzz, you hear?

552
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,942
Now, I'm serious. It's on the house.

553
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,111
Audrey!

554
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,655
You got the handcuffs?

555
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,032
They're right in my bag.

556
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,524
You ought to see the way he treats her, Twoey.

557
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,611
She deserves a prince,
not a sadistic creep like him.

558
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,157
The man's a total disgrace
to the dental profession.

559
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,743
I don't know what's going on sometimes.

560
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,912
Seems like the whole world's going crazy.

561
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,415
At least we got each other, right?

562
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,544
I'm gonna turn in, Twoey.
I'll see you in the morning.

563
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,385
SEYMOUR:
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

564
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,221
Come on, I haven't got much left.

565
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,265
Just give me a few days to heal, okay?

566
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,352
- Then we'll start again on the left hand and...
- Feed me.

567
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,187
I beg your pardon?

568
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,813
Feed me.

569
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,235
Twoey, you talked! You opened your trap,
your thing, and you said...

570
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,613
Feed me, Krelborn! Feed me now!

571
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,822
Uh...

572
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,658
- I can't!
- I'm starving!

573
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,119
Look, maybe I can squeeze
a little more out of this one.

574
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,664
- Ooh! More! More! More! More!
- There isn't any more!

575
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,583
What do you want me to do?
Slit my wrists?

576
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,001
Ahh.

577
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,420
Oh, boy! Look, I've got an idea.

578
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,215
I'll go to Shmendrik's
and pick you up some nice chopped sirloin.

579
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,384
Must be blood.

580
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,470
- Twoey, that's disgusting.
- Must be fresh.

581
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,763
I don't want to hear this.

582
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,641
- Feed me!
- Does it have to be human?

583
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,310
- Feed me!
- Does it have to be mine?

584
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,146
- Feed me!
- Where am I supposed to get it?

585
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,483
♫ Feed me, Seymour

I can grow up big and strong

593
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,761
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You eat blood, Audrey II. Let's face it.

594
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,764
How am I supposed to keep on feeding you?
Kill people?

595
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,809
- I'll make it worth your while.
- What?

596
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,603
You think this is all coincidence, baby?

597
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,441
The sudden success around here?
The press coverage?

598
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,445
Look, you're a plant. An inanimate object.

599
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,407
Does this look inanimate to you, punk?

600
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:57,078
If I can talk and I can move,
who's to say I can't do anything I want?

601
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,123

- Like deliver, pal. Aah!

00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,751
You didn't have nothin'
Till you met me

627
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,420
Come on, kid
What will it be?

628
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,048
Money?
Girls?

629
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,800
One particular girl

630
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,011
How 'bout that Audrey?

631
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,680
Think it over

632
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,725
There must be someone you can 86
Real quiet like

633
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,186
And get me some lunch

634
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,689
Think about a room at the Ritz

635
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,650
Wrapped in velvet, covered in glitz

636
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:55,780
A little nookie gonna clean up those zits
And you'll get it, uh huh

637
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,991
Gee, I'd like a Harley machine

638
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,618
- Now you're cookin'
- Toolin' around like I was James Dean

639
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,037
- Yeah, yeah
- Makin' all the guys on the corner turn green

640
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,832
So go get it!
Whoo whoo whoo

641
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,084
If you wanna be profound

642
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,628
If you really gotta justify

643
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,964
Take a breath and look around

644
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,508
A lot of folks deserve to die

645
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,678
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
That's not a very nice thing to say.

646
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,848
- But it's true, isn't it?
- No!

647
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,768
I don't know anyone who deserves to get
chopped up and fed to a hungry plant!

648
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,978
Mm.

649
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,232
Sure you do. Ha-ha-ha.

650
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,331
Stupid woman!
Christ, what a frigging scatterbrain!

651
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry, doctor!

652
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,419
I'm sorry, doctor! Oh!

653
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,464
Falls off the motorcycle!

654
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,258
I'm clumsy, doctor! I'm clumsy, doctor!

655
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,218
ORIN:
Musses my hair!

656
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,262
Get the door open, you little slut!

657
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,098
I'm trying, doctor! I'm trying, doctor!

658
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,726
Get the Vitalis. Quick, the Vitalis!

659
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,311
I'm out of it!

660
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,687
ORIN:
What?

661
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,282
♫ If you want a rationale
It isn't very hard to see

662
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,619
No, no, no
Stop and think it over, pal

663
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:29,499
The guy sure looks like plant food to me

664
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,503
- The guy sure looks like plant food to me
- Yeah, ow!

665
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,380
He's so nasty treatin' her rough

666
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,674
Yeah, smackin' her around
And always talkin' so tough

667
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,176
You need blood
And he's got more than enough

668
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,679
I need blood and he's got more than enough

669
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:49,477
- You need blood and he's got more than enough
- I need blood and he's got more than enough

670
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,562
So go get it

671
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,123
Hey, does that mean they're finished?
My turn?

672
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,958
Sit.

673
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,215
Whoo! What happened?
What did he do? Tell me everything!

674
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,722
Yeah. Well, they have to do that
to remove the jaw.

675
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,144
Ah, consider yourself very, very lucky.

676
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,234
- Next!
- It's me, Arthur Denton! I'm next!

677
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,111
- Nurse!
- Hmm?

678
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,364
Does, uh, that have an appointment?

679
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,243
Ask it. I'm off duty.

680
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,081
I've been saving all month for this.
I think I need a root canal.

681
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,668
I'm sure I need a long, slow root canal.

682
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,882
- Let's go.
- I have a history of dental problems.

683
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,842
ORIN:
Shut up!

684
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,636
Yes, doctor.

685
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,269
I went to a terrible dentist Wednesday,
who was recommended to me...

686
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,104
...by somebody that I saw on Monday...

687
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,815
...who is the brother of a man
that I usually see on Sundays.

688
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,151
And their mother taught them
everything they know.

689
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,613
She's gifted, but quite elderly.
People think she shouldn't be working.

690
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,072
But I go to her because...

691
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,742
...I'm just incredibly devoted to her strength.
- Huh.

692
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,413
She can't really see who you are,
but she knows the sound of your voice.

693
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,751
If you tell her where it is, the problem, she
eventually finds the trouble and she does it.

694
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,421
I wish I had that stamina.
I can only go so long.

695
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,841
That's how I want to be.
I don't ever want to have to be just...

696
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,344
Comfy?

697
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,137
Yes, doctor.

698
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,432
I remember the first time I went to a dentist.

699
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,768
I thought, "What a neat job!
If only I were a dentist."

700
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:58,022
The dentist I went to had the greatest car.
He had a Corvette. I thought, "My gosh.

701
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,691
Everybody calls him 'Doctor, '
and he's not really a doctor."

702
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,527
Oh, my God.

703
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:09,617
"If only I got out of here okay."
But then after everything was all finished...

704
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,161
...they gave me a candy bar.
I thought, "This is what I get?

705
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,996
A candy bar?"

706
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,416
This is what you do. You go through
a thing and get chocolate out of it.

707
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:22,380
Getting to work with incredible professionals
who use incredibly wonderful equipment...

708
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,674
Let's take a look at that mouth.

709
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,926
Say, "Aah!"

710
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,391
Aah, candy bar!

711
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,726
Ohh! Candy bar! Candy bar!

712
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,937
Oh, that's great. Come on!

713
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,277
Gosh! Oh, God. Do it again.

714
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,863
Oh, God, doctor. Whoo!

715
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,865
Yeah, aw, great!

716
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,868
Oh, you are something special.

717
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,871
You are something special!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

718
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,205
Mm, aw, oh!

719
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,291
Thank you!

720
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,670
Yeah, thank you!

721
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,549
Oh, my God.
It's your professionalism that I respect.

722
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,887
Oh, God! Don't stop, doc! Don't stop!
Come on! More!

723
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,222
Yeah! Yeah, come on! Yeah!

724
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,560
What do you want? Say, "Please!"
Ah, ah, ah.

725
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,229
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

726
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,068
Great! Oh!

727
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,738
I'm gonna get a candy bar!
I'm gonna get a candy bar!

728
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,823
Come on! Come on.

729
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,996
Oh, yeah! Yeah, oh!

730
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,880
Wow!

731
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:50,676
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

732
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,346
Yes! Yeah.

733
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,681
- Get out.
- What's wrong?

734
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,808
Get out of here.

735
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,022
What's the matter?

736
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,401
Go on! Get out of here!

737
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,612
Right this way.

738
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,114
I'm gonna tell each and every one
of my friends about you...

739
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,616
...and they're gonna...
- Just get...

740
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,077
- What's this?
- Oops.

741
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,287
Ha-ha-ha! Sorry.

742
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,164
Goddamn sicko.

743
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,711
Let me ask you something.
Does this thing scare you?

744
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,630
- Yes.
- Would you like if I took this thing...

745
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,632
...and made straight
for your goddamn incisors?

746
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,925
- No.
- It'd hurt, right?

747
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,468
- Mm-hm.
- You'd scream, right?

748
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,428
- Mm-hm.
- Well get your ass in here!

749
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,767
- Say, don't I know you?
- Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday.

750
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,811
Oh, your mouth's a mess, kid.

751
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,856
That wisdom tooth.
We'll just rip that bugger right out of there.

752
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,066
- What do you say?
- No!

753
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,735
There's always time for dental hygiene, Seymour.

754
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,114
You ever seen the results of a neglected mouth?

755
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,242
Look, Seymour.

756
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,661
- This could happen to you.
- Uh...

757
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,790
- Unless I take immediate action.
- What's that?

758
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,501
- A drill.
- It's rusty.

759
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,044
It's an antique.

760
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,588
They don't make them like this anymore.

761
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,425
Sturdy, heavy...

762
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,093
...dull.

763
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,099
I'm gonna want some gas for this.

764
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,769
Thank God. I thought you wouldn't use any.

765
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,148
Oh, the gas isn't for you, Seymour.
It's for me.

766
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,985
You see, I want to really enjoy this.

767
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:35,156
In fact, I'm gonna use my special gas mask.

768
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:40,953
I find a little giggle gas before
I begin increases my pleasure enormously.

769
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,626
Here we go!

770
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:04,143
Oh, Seymour, I'm flying!
Ha-ha-ha.

771
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,272
The things I'm gonna do to that mouth!
Ha-ha-ha!

772
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,126
Huh? What the hell is that?

773
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,754
A gun? Ha-ha-ha!

774
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,216
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!
Ha-ha-ha!

775
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,677
Oh, Jesus, ha, ha! I'm in trouble now, huh?

776
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,557
Wait until I turn this gas off.

777
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,895
Uh-oh.

778
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,107
Aw, give me a hand, would you? Ha, ha.

779
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,192
No, I guess you wouldn't, would you?

780
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,658
You see, Seymour, I could asphyx...

781
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,411
Asphyx...

782
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,172
What'd I ever do to you?

783
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,925
Nothing. It's what you did to her.

784
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,427
Her who?

785
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,265
Oh, her.

786
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,652
SEYMOUR:
Shh! Go away.

787
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,911
Ooh! Chop it up.

788
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,455
- What?
- Feed me!

789
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,540
Okay, okay.

790
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,753
Oh, brother.

791
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,118
Audrey, what'd they say to you?

792
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,079
Uh, who?

793
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,499
- The police.
- Oh, uh, nothing.

794
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,585
Audrey, talk to me. Tell me what they said.

795
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,922
It's Orin. They say he's disappeared!

796
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,426
- The police, they told you that?
- They suspect foul play.

797
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,929
They do?

798
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,766
His receptionist, this morning
she found the place a shambles.

799
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,726
Gas masks everywhere.

800
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,854
Things all over the floor.

801
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,689
They think...

802
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,984
I can't even think about what they think.

803
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,161
Audrey.

804
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,499
Don't cry, Audrey.

805
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,503
Would it be so terrible
if something had happened to him?

806
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,714
Seymour, what a thing to say!

807
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,426
Well, would it?

808
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,138
It wouldn't be terrible at all.

809
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,640
It'd be a miracle.

810
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:22,020
Not to mention all the money I'd save
on Epsom salts and ACE bandages.

811
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,313
You see?

812
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,817
But I'd still feel guilty. I mean...

813
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:31,822
If he met with foul play
or some terrible accident of some kind...

814
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,908
...it'd be partly my fault just because...

815
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,162
...secretly I wished it.

816
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,748
Audrey, don't you waste another minute
thinking about that creep!

817
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:47,087
There's a lot of guys that'd give anything
to go out with you.

818
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,090
Nice guys.

819
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,969
I don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.

820
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,638
- That's not true.
- You don't know the half of it!

821
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,807
I've led a terrible life.

822
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:04,104
I deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, D.D.S.

823
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,690
You know where I met him?

824
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,819
In the Gutter.

825
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,237
The gutter?

826
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,157
The Gutter. It's a nightspot.

827
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,911
I worked there on my nights off
when we weren't making much money.

828
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,787
I'd put on...

829
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:25,042
...cheap and tasteless outfits,
not nice ones like this.

830
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,378
Low and nasty apparel.

831
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,714
Audrey, that's all behind you now.

832
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,675
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

833
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,554
You're a very nice person.
I always knew you were.

834
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,684
Underneath the bruises and the handcuffs,
you know what I saw?

835
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,978
A girl I respected.

836
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,064
I still do.

837
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,527
♫ Lift up your head

838
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,738
Wash off your mascara

839
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,740
Here, take my Kleenex

840
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,201
Wipe that lipstick away

841
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,329
Show me your face

842
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,873
Clean as the morning

843
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,167
I know things were bad

844
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,088
But now they're okay

845
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:17,386
Suddenly Seymour

846
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,430
Is standing beside you

847
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:26,520
You don't need no makeup

848
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:31,608
Don't have to pretend

849
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:36,029
Suddenly Seymour

850
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:40,576
Is here to provide you

851
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:45,455
Sweet understanding

852
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,792
- Seymour's your friend
- Nobody ever

853
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,378
Treated me kindly

854
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,839
Daddy left early

855
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,716
Mama was poor

856
00:59:55,883 --> 01:00:00,053
I'd meet a man
And I'd follow him blindly

857
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,139
He'd snap his fingers

858
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:06,685
Me, I'd say "sure"

859
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,981
Suddenly Seymour

860
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,402
Is standing beside me

861
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,948
He don't give me orders

862
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:24,494
He don't condescend

863
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:28,582
Suddenly Seymour

864
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,086
Is here to provide me

865
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:37,716
Sweet understanding

866
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,053
- Seymour's my friend
- Tell me this feeling

867
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,096
Lasts 'til forever

868
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:47,267
Tell me the bad times
Are clean washed away

869
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:51,313
Please understand that
It's still strange and frightenin'

870
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,523
For losers like I've been

871
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:57,611
It's so hard to say

872
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,865
- Suddenly Seymour
- Suddenly Seymour

873
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:06,119
- He purified me
- He purified you

874
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:10,540
- Suddenly Seymour
- Suddenly Seymour

875
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:16,421
- Showed me I can
- Yes you can

876
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:20,467
Learn how to be more

877
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:24,721
- The girl that's inside me
- The girl that's inside you

878
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:33,063
- With sweet understanding
- With sweet understanding

879
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:37,734
With sweet understanding

880
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,902
Seymour's your

881
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,967
Man

882
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,108
MUSHNIK:
You love her madly, don't you, schmuck?

883
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,360
Mr. Mushnik, you scared me. I...

884
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,615
I scared him?
After what I've seen, I scared him?

885
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:11,203
Do you think I didn't know, huh?
Oh, I knew.

886
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,206
I knew you lay down here
on your pathetic little cot...

887
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,707
...and dreamed about her.

888
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,084
But I didn't know the lengths
to which you'd go...

889
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,670
...the depths to which you'd sink!

890
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,298
What depths? What sink?
What are you talking about?

891
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,092
Little red dots all over the linoleum.

892
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,970
Little red spots on the concrete outside.

893
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:34,518
I'm talking blood, Krelborn.
I'm talking under my own roof.

894
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,520
An axe murderer!

895
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:39,731
♫ He's got your number now

896
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:40,982
I saw everything.

897
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,568
TWOEY:
He knows just what you've done

898
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,403
Everything you did to her boyfriend.

899
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,323
TWOEY:
You've got no place to hide

900
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,783
I saw you chopping him.

901
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,744
TWOEY:
You've got nowhere to run

902
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,872
It's true. I chopped him up,
but I didn't kill him!

903
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,791
TWOEY:
He knows your life of crime

904
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,751
Tell it to the police.

905
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,797
I think it's suppertime

906
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,966
Hoo, hoo, whoo

907
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,301
Come on, come on

908
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,428
Think about all those offers

909
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,014
Come on, come on

910
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,975
Your future with Audrey

911
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,102
Come on, come on

912
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,479
Ain't no time to turn squeamish

913
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,189
C-C-C-Come on!

914
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,775
I swear on all my spores

915
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:28,280
When he's gone the world will be yours

916
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,740
Yours
Yeah, yeah

917
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:34,744

It's suppertime

920
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,973
You know, Krelborn, it kills me doing this.

921
01:04:55,141 --> 01:05:00,353
But considering you're almost like a son
to me, I'm thinking...

922
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,439
...maybe we don't have to go to the police.

923
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:07,027
- We don't?
- I'm thinking...

924
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:12,407
...what if I kept my mouth shut
and gave you a one-way ticket out of town?

925
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,201
You'd do that, sir?

926
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:20,123
You could lay low for a while, say 30, 40 years.

927
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,168
Meanwhile, I would keep the plant.

928
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,670
- The plant?
- Of course...

929
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,174
...you'd have to teach me
how to take care of it while you're away.

930
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:33,178
Give me your secret gardening tips.

931
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,640
But then, if you'd rather hang...

932
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:40,644

SEYMOUR:
Just feed it.

936
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,616
Just feed it what?

- Minerals.
- Yes.

940
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,754

01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,134
It's suppertime

944
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,638
- But whatever you do...
- Yes?

945
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:20,767
It's suppertime

946
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,354
- Whatever you do...
- Yeah?

947
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,986
- What the hell is?
- Sir?

948
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,614
MUSHNIK:
Wait! Wait! Wait!

949
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,367
Aah! Oh, wait! Aah!

950
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:45,250
Suppertime

951
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,754
Seymour Krelborn!

952
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,465
Finally, we meet! What an occasion!
Let's toast it. Up yours.

953
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,426
- Canapé?
- Cigarette?

954
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,762
Let's talk turkey. Sign here.
We'll book you on lecturing tours.

955
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,390
Yes, darling.
We're sending photographers Thursday.

956
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,809
So get the plant ready and wear a clean shirt.

957
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,561
- Just sign this release.
- Need a pen?

958
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,188
Aren't you thrilled?
It's the cover of LIFE magazine!

959
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,233
- Dessert?
- I tell you, son, it's a cinch to get ratings.

960
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,819
- The title is Marvin's.
- The concept is mine.

961
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,280
The first weekly gardening show on a network!

962
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,158
- And you're gonna host it, you lucky kid.
- Sign!

963
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,744
♫ They say the meek shall inherit

964
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,954
You know the book doesn't lie

965
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,290
It's not a question of merit

966
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,667
It's not demand and supply

967
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,503
They say the meek gonna get it

968
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:44,476
You know the meek are gonna get
What's comin' to them

969
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,643
By and by

970
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,535
Oh, my God!

971
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:06,831
And here he is himself,
Mr. Seymour Krelborn!

972
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,709
Mr. Krelborn, there are so many questions...

973
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:12,420
...the American people
in our television audience have for you.

974
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,839
Come and tell our viewers
at home and elsewhere...

975
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,343
...about this particularly amazing
agricultural phenomenon.

976
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,345
A phenomenon, I might add, that has made you...

977
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,473
...one of the most talked-about
plant scientists in the country...

978
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,851
Cut!

979
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,854
What the hell? What happened
to the goddamned greenery?

980
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,649
- It just needs to be fed.
- So feed it.

981
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,901
I can't feed it. Not now.

982
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,903
I'll feed it.
Where do you keep the plant food?

983
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:41,074
It doesn't eat plant food.
And I can't feed it now.

984
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,244
Why don't you leave me alone? All of you.

985
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,455
Just go away. Leave me alone.
Get out of here.

986
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,916
Go away. Leave me alone!

987
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,462
- Everybody go away! Leave me alone!
- Seymour!

988
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,589
You're hysterical.

989
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,174
I know. I'm sorry.

990
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,313
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

991
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,733
I never should've started, but I did.
Now, if I don't feed it, it'll die.

992
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,777
And I'll lose her, I'll lose everything.

993
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,364
- Seymour? Who are you talking to?
- Oh. Huh?

994
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,032
Nobody.

995
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,118
You're acting funny.

996
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,579
It wasn't nice throwing those people out.

997
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,498
Those men said
Seymour Krelborn's Gardening Tips...

998
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,251
...is sure to be a very big TV show.

999
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:37,005
- I know. I'm sorry. I feel terrible.
- Well, you shouldn't.

1000
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,675
They're coming back tomorrow
and they're bringing you a great big check.

1001
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,343
They are?

1002
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,763
I wish you were enjoying your success.

1003
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,849
They said they're coming back with money?

1004
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,684
Tomorrow.

1005
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,895
Then we could afford
to get out of here, couldn't we?

1006
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:53,146
Uh, what do you mean?

1007
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:55,857
That's it. After tomorrow
we could leave here together.

1008
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,817
Together?

1009
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,528
If you'll have me.

1010
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,280
Audrey, will you have me?

1011
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,365
Uh, what do you mean?

1012
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,826
Marry me, Audrey.

1013
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,913
- Oh, Seymour, this is so sudden.
- Will you?

1014
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,795
Sure.

1015
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,506
Then that's it!
We'll go get married right now.

1016
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,842
- Oh, Seymour!
- Tomorrow we'll come back...

1017
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,012
...I'll be on television, get the money
and then we'll live happy ever after.

1018
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,307
Oh, Audrey, I'll give you a wonderful life
with no plants, I promise.

1019
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,060
- No plants at all.
- You're talking peculiar again, Seymour.

1020
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,520
We'll start tonight,
we'll go to City Hall, get married...

1021
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:37,440
...and then spend the night somewhere
it's safe. Some nice hotel.

1022
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,901
- Oh, Seymour.
- Oh, Audrey.

1023
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,861
Oh, I've got to get ready! Heh!

1024
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,197
Hurry. Hurry.

1025
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,639
Feed me.

1026
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,351
- Under no circumstances.
- Feed me.

1027
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:57,687
I will not, so stop asking.

1028
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,230
Feed me!

1029
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,442
No! No more!
I can't take living with the guilt.

1030
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,610
Tough titty.

1031
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,531
- Watch your language.
- Aw, cut the crap. Bring on the meat.

1032
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,242
Okay, okay.

1033
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,746
I'll bring you meat. I'll run down to the corner,
pick you up some ground round.

1034
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,833
- How about that?
- Don't do me no favors!

1035
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,710
- Look.
- Hmm?

1036
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,755
It's my last offer. Yes or no?

1037
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:28,551
You sure do drive a hard bargain.

1038
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:32,138
Done. Fine. Great.

1039
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,601
Don't think you're getting dessert.

1040
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,329
Unh.

1041
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,323
Hello.

1042
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,450
♫ Hey, little lady, hello

1043
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,494
Who...? Who is this?

1044
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,497
You're looking cute as can be

1045
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,166
Is this someone I know?

1046
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,210
You're looking mighty sweet

1047
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,337
Seymour!

1048
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:32,008
No, it ain't Seymour. Ha, ha, it's me!

1049
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:38,681
AUDREY:
Oh, my God!

1050
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,243
I don't believe it.

1051
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,038
Believe it, baby. It talks.

1052
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,081
Am I dreaming this?

1053
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,084
No, and you ain't in Kansas, neither.

1054
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,505
Something is very wrong here.

1055
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,926
I need me some water in the worst way.

1056
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:16,969
Look at my branches.

1057
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:20,014
I'm drying up. I'm a goner, honey!

1058
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:23,809
♫ Come on and give me a drink

1059
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,645
I don't know if I should.

1060
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:28,189
Hey, little lady, be nice

1061
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,857
Do you talk to Seymour like this?

1062
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,902
Sure do I'll drink it straight

1063
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,528
Your leaves are dry, poor thing.

1064
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,156
Don't need no glass or no ice

1065
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,866
Uh, I'll get the can.

1066
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,078
Don't need no twist of lime

1067
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,329
Here we go.

1068
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,831
And now it's suppertime!

1069
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,918
Oh!

1070
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,337
Ah, ha-ha-ha.

1071
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,966
Oh, relax, doll, and it'll be easier.

1072
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:59,095
Come join your dentist friend and Mushnik,
ha, ha.

1073
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:04,767
- Aah!
- They're right inside. Ha-ha-ha!

1074
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:20,574
SEYMOUR:
Get off of her! Get off!

1075
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,396
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1076
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,398
No.

1077
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,030
Don't die, Audrey. Please don't die.

1078
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:05,619
You know, the plant just said
the strangest thing just now.

1079
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,456
It said Orin and Mr. Mushnik...

1080
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:10,791
...are already inside.

1081
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:14,295
It's true.

1082
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,255
I did it.

1083
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,883
I fed them to it.

1084
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,055
And that's what made it so big and strong...

1085
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,808
...and you so famous?

1086
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,269
I've done terrible things, Audrey.

1087
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:34,732
- But not to you. Never to you.
- But...

1088
01:17:37,652 --> 01:17:40,529
I want you to, Seymour.

1089
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,656
What?

1090
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:48,746
When I die, which should be very shortly...

1091
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,165
...give me to the plant.

1092
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:57,088
So that it will live, and bring you
all the wonderful things you deserve.

1093
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:01,050
- You don't know what you're saying.
- But I do.

1094
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,970
It's the one gift I can give you.

1095
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,473
And if I'm in the plant...

1096
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,851
...then I am part of the plant.

1097
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,854
So in a way...

1098
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:18,609
...we'll always be together.

1099
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:26,450
♫ You'll wash my tender leaves

1100
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:32,706
You'll smell my sweet perfume

1101
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,545
You'll water me and care for me

1102
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:42,550
You'll see me bud and bloom

1103
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:47,513
I'm feeling strangely happy now

1104
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:54,728
Contented and serene

1105
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:01,444
Oh, don't you see

1106
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:07,825
Finally I'll be

1107
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:14,081
Somewhere

1108
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,793
That's

1109
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,730
Green

1110
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,677
MAN:
Hey! Watch it!

1111
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:10,007
MARTIN:
Mr. Krelborn.

1112
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,968
Uh, Mr. Krelborn?

1113
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,513
Patrick Martin.

1114
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,641
International Licensing and Marketing.

1115
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,851
I wanna show you something.

1116
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:24,271
- I'm not interested.
- Ah, but you will be.

1117
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:27,983
Look.

1118
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:34,114
I took the liberty of taking a cutting
from that amazing plant of yours.

1119
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:36,492
And look what grew in just a couple of days.

1120
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,624
The Design boys did the packaging.

1121
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,376
Cute, huh?

1122
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:46,835
Get the idea?

1123
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:51,131
My firm is willing to pay you a reasonable
amount to take leaf cuttings...

1124
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,966
...develop little Audrey Ils...

1125
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:56,345
...sell them in florist shops, supermarkets.
Across the nation.

1126
01:22:56,554 --> 01:23:00,349
Pretty soon,
every household in America will have one.

1127
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,685
Imagine it, boy.
We could make a fortune.

1128
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:04,311
Little Audrey Ils, everywhere.

1129
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,191
This could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.

1130
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:13,195
What do you say, Mr. Krelborn?

1131
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,794
Mr. Krelborn.

1132
01:23:29,003 --> 01:23:30,045
Krelborn!

1133
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,382
Hey! We don't have to deal with you,
you know!

1134
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:36,051
A goddamn vegetable's public domain!

1135
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,804
You ask our lawyers!

1136
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:48,897
Every household in America. That's
what you had in mind all along, isn't it?

1137
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,608
No shit, Sherlock.

1138
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:54,069
We're not talking about one hungry plant here.

1139
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,238
We're talking about world conquest.

1140
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,949
And I wanna thank you.

1141
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:02,369
You ate the only thing I ever loved.

1142
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:08,417
You're a monster, and so am I.

1143
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,211
It's gotta end. It's gonna stop right here.

1144
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,671
♫ Better wait a minute

1145
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,048
Uh, you better hold the phone

1146
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,968
Better mind your manners

1147
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,386
Better change your tone

1148
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,473
Don't you threaten me, son

1149
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:24,099
You got a lot of gall

1150
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,727
We're gonna do things my way

1151
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:29,813
Or we won't do things at all

1152
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,527
Uh-huh!

1153
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,946
You in trouble now.

1154
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,407
Baby, yeah.

1155
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,348
You don't know
What you're messing with

1156
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,892
Uh, you got no idea

1157
01:25:07,101 --> 01:25:09,102
You don't know what you're looking at

1158
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,605
When you're looking here

1159
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,732
You don't know what you're up against

1160
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,151
No, no way, no how

1161
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,487
You don't know
What you're messing with

1162
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:20,948
But I'm gonna tell you now

1163
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,665
Get this straight
I'm just a mean green mother

1164
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,250
From outer space and I'm bad

1165
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,085
Mean, green, bad

1166
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,128
I'm just a mean green mother
From outer space

1167
01:25:35,338 --> 01:25:37,506
And it looks like you've been had

1168
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:39,800
I'm just a mean green mother
From outer space

1169
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:42,344
So get off my back
And get out my face

1170
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,388
'Cause I'm mean and green

1171
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:46,682
And I am bad

1172
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,187
I'm bad

1173
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:54,815
Yeah

1174
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:01,655
Ooh!
Wanna save your skin, boy?

1175
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,032
You wanna save your hide?

1176
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:05,993
You wanna see tomorrow?
Ha, ha

1177
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,745
You better step aside

1178
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:11,081
Better take a tip, boy

1179
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,125
Want some good advice?

1180
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,168
You better take it easy

1181
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:17,504
'Cause you're walking on thin ice

1182
01:26:18,172 --> 01:26:20,132
You don't know
What you're dealing with

1183
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:22,509
No, you never did

1184
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,595
You don't know what you're looking at

1185
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:27,222
But that's tough titty, kid

1186
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,141
The lion don't sleep tonight

1187
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,643
And if you pull his tail, he roars

1188
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,770
You say that ain't fair
You say that ain't nice

1189
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,064
You know what I say? Up yours

1190
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:39,484
TWOEY:
Yeah

1191
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:43,113
Ow! Watch me now
I'm just a mean green mother

1192
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:44,656
From outer space and I'm bad

1193
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,116
Mean, green, bad

1194
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,660
I'm just a mean green mother
A real disgrace

1195
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,579
And you've got me fighting mad

1196
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:53,332
I'm just a mean green mother
From outer space

1197
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,918
Gonna trash your ass
Gonna rock this place

1198
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,753
I'm mean and green

1199
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:01,089
And I am bad

1200
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:03,550
Mm-hm

1201
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,719
You know I don't come
From no black lagoon

1202
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,888
I'm from past the stars
And beyond the moon

1203
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:10,682
You can keep the Thing
Keep the It

1204
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,185
Keep the Creature
They don't mean shit

1205
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,314
Unh-unh-uh!

1206
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,359
I got killer buds, a power stem

1207
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,027
Nasty thorns and I'm using them

1208
01:27:22,236 --> 01:27:24,446
So better move it out, nature calls

1209
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:26,907
You got the point?
I'm gonna bust your balls

1210
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,298
Here it comes

1211
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:06,697
I'm mean and green

1212
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:09,449
Mean green mother from outer space

1213
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,326
I'm mean and green

1214
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,121
Mean green mother from outer space

1215
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:15,539
I'm mean and green

1216
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,712
Ooh!

1217
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:03,837
And I

1218
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,923
Am
Unh!

1219
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:10,719
Bad

1220
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:50,819
♫ Subsequent to the events
♫ You have just witnessed

1221
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:56,867
Similar events in cities across America

1222
01:30:57,076 --> 01:31:02,539
Events which bore
A striking resemblance

1223
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:08,670
To the ones you have just seen
Began occurring

1224
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,298
Ooh!

1225
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:15,969
Subsequent to the events
You have just witnessed

1226
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:21,266
Unsuspecting jerks
From Maine to California

1227
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:26,563
Made the acquaintance
Of a new breed of flytrap

1228
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:32,319
And got sweet-talked
Into feeding it blood

1229
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:38,909
Thus the plants worked
Their terrible will

1230
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:43,205
Finding jerks
Who would feed them their fill

1231
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:47,751
And the plants proceeded to grow

1232
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,045
And grow

1233
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:55,091
And began what they came here to do

1234
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:58,970
Which was essentially to

1235
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:03,308
Eat Cleveland

1236
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:07,479
And Des Moines

1237
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:11,441
And Peoria

1238
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:15,695
And New York

1239
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:17,405
And where you live

1240
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:26,414
They may offer you fortune and fame

1241
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,709
Love and money and instant acclaim

1242
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:34,339
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants

1243
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:39,552
They may offer you lots of cheap thrills

1244
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:42,806
Dates and discos in Beverly Hills

1245
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:47,477
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants

1246
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,987
Look out, here comes Audrey II

1247
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:02,492
Look out, here I come for you

1248
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:07,414
I come for you

1249

MAN:
Oh, my God!

01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:01,051
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha.

1251
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,273
Help!

1252
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:07,760
♫ Hold your hat
♫ And hang on to your soul

1253
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,055
Something's coming
To eat the world whole

1254
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,516
If we fight it
We've still got a chance

1255
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,604
But whatever they offer you

1256
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:20,690
Though they're slopping the trough
For you

1257
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:27,489
Please whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants
