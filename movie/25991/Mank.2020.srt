if it catches fire tonight, you will let me know?

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,660
你可是无所不知
I mean, you know all kinds of things.

151
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,620
五音步抑扬格  伟大诗人的诗句
Iambic pentameter, the words of the great poets.

152
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,570
她这样签名是什么意思呢  "永远的  艾瑟尔"
What about the way she signed it? "Always, Ethel."

153
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,330
你能想象到吗
Can you beat that?

154
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,110
不只是"艾瑟尔"  而是"永远的  艾瑟尔"
Not just "Ethel." "Always, Ethel."

155
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,800
汤米  如果我们能在日落前抵达某个城镇
Tommy, if we can find civilization by sundown,

156
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,010
我希望能爬出这铁皮车  一头钻进冰马蒂尼酒
I hope to climb out of this crate and into a cold martini.

157
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,480
如果不是真心的  她就不会加上"永远的"
She's not the kind to use "always" if she didn't mean it.

158
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,530
如果她只想说自己是"艾瑟尔"
If she meant just "Ethel,"

159
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,340
那她就不会加上"永远的"三个字
she'd write just "Ethel," not "always."

160
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,490
-你说呢  -看路  汤米
- Wouldn't you think? - The road, Tommy.

161
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,530

I know.

162
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,800
你看一遍就懂我的意思了
You read it and see what I mean.

163
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,640
她爱我  不是吗
She loves me, don't you think?

164
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,600
曼克  我是奥森·威尔斯
Mank? It's Orson Welles.

165
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,980
-还能是谁  -我们该谈谈了
- Of course it is. - I think it's time we talked.

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,300

曾是山上的一座城堡
Once a castle on a hill,

169
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,350
如今已变成一段回忆
now a memory of what once was.

170
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,350
只身在他那尚未完工  却早已破败的享乐宫
Alone in his unfinished, already decaying pleasure palace,

171
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,860
偏远冷淡  罕有人至  从未被拍成照片
aloof, seldom visited, never photographed,

172
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,470
我们看见一个老头穿着浴袍  抽着烟斗
we see an old man in a robe, smoking a pipe,

173
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,540
独自坐在泳池旁
sitting alone by his pool...

174
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,660
废弃的纸张散落在他的脚边
discarded pages scattered at his feet.

妄图像从前那样
vainly attempting to sway, as he once did,

178
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,250
改变一个国度的命运
the destinies of a nation

179
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,900
而这个国度早已不再听命于他"
which had long since ceased to listen to him..."

180
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,970
不对  "不再信任他"
No. "Had ceased to trust him."

181
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,220
透过树梢  我们看见一位助手
We see through trees as an aide

182
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,410
推着坐在轮椅上的这个老头

我们喝杯茶吧  亚夫人
Let's have that cuppa, Mrs. A.

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,660
我知道那个人是谁
I know who it is.

188
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,190
或者说你想写的是谁
Or who it's meant to be.

189
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,060
你为什么会觉得我写的确有其人呢
What makes you think it's meant to be anybody?

190
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,330
少来了
Oh, come, now.

191
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,300
只要是说英语的人都能马上认出他是谁
Everyone in the English-speaking world will recognize him instantly.

192
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,040
他还真是会说这种话的人
Exactly what he would say.

193
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,760
-你认识他吗  -可能吧
- Did you know the man? - Maybe.

- You wrote for one of his papers? - Oh, no, praise God.

196
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,900
我是在他开始资助他女友的电影后认识他的
I met him after he started bankrolling his girlfriend's pictures.

- If anyone did. - Really?

她是什么样的
What's she like?

骨子里却都是狂热的电影迷
you get a swooning moving-picture fan

完全忘记了自己在历史课上
who has forgotten all she ever learned

我们想的是跟以往不同的派拉蒙电影
Well, we see a different kind of Paramount picture.

280
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,670
怎么个不同法
Different how?

281
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,050
《科学怪人》和《狼人》合二为一  只是...
Frankenstein and The Wolf Man all rolled into one, only...

282
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,210
我不做廉价的恐怖片  环球才做这种片子
I don't make cheap horror pictures, Universal does.

283
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,700
这个不一样  这个有内涵
Uh, this is different. This is about something.

284
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,910
行吧
Okay...

285
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,830
西德尼
Sidney.

286
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,970
想象一个疯狂的科学家
Imagine a mad scientist,

287
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,930
带着他制造的机械怪物到穷乡僻壤巡游
touring the boonies with a mechanical freak he's fabricated.

288
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,200
什么叫他"制造"的
Now, what does he mean, "fabricated"?

289
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,660
并将其放在一个巨大的丝绸镶边的盒子里
And displays it to superstitious hayseeds

290
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,000
给那些迷信的乡巴佬看
in a giant, silk-lined casket

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
以此收取入场费
for the price of admission.

292
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,840
但每到满月时  怪物就会醒来
But every full moon, the monster awakens

293
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,080
并给村民带来噩梦般的危害
and raises unholy hell with the villagers.

294
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,200
做成东欧的风格
Give it a Eastern European look,

295
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,170
男的穿皮短裤  女的穿破烂的农民上衣
men in leather shorts, gals in tattered peasant blouses.

296
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,400
我猜猜  他们认为那是恶魔
Let me guess. They think it's the devil?

297
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,270
村民看什么都觉得是恶魔
Villagers always think it's the devil.

298
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,360
科学家和他创造的怪物被迫
And the scientist and his creation are forced to flee

299
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,390
在一场雷电交加的暴风雨中逃跑
during a raging electrical storm.

300
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,670
身后是愤怒的农民们
Flee from outraged peasants...

301
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,480
带着火把穷追不舍
Who pursue them mit torches...

302
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,030
掀翻了他们吱吱作响的马车
Overturn their creaky wagon...

303
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,130
并一把火给烧了
And set fire to it.

304
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,640
给他讲讲结尾  查理
Tell him about the finale, Charlie.

305
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,780
这个...
Well...

306
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,090
大雨变成了雨夹雪
The rain turns to sleet,

307
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,060
浇灭了大火  并将怪物埋葬在了坚冰之下
puts out the fire, and entombs the monster in solid ice.

308
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,630
而不远处  一位年迈的牧师暗自抹了把眼泪
While nearby, an old priest weeps.

309
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,390
抹泪的牧师
A weeping priest?

310
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,750
雷  电  血  火  宗教...
Thunder, lightning, blood, fire, religion...

311
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,600
都出现在一部电影里
All in one film?

312
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,940
随着一次反季的回暖
And with an unseasonal thaw...

313
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,810
续集来了
A sequel.

314
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,140
你不是说这有内涵吗  不是不一样吗
I thought you said this was about something, this was different.

315
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,930
还有人类想扮演上帝却注定是徒劳
Plus, the ominous futility of man playing God.

316
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,820
浮士德式的永生交易
The Faustian bargain of life everlasting.

317
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,590
还有人类精神的胜利
And the triumph of the human spirit

318
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,460
战胜化身于我们坚实躯体的野兽
over the beast incarnate in our far-too-solid flesh.

319
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,760
给谁拍都能拍好
It's director-proof.

320
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,590
乔
Joe.

321
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,000
-B级片  -不适合乔
- B picture. - It's not for Joe.

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,690
伙计们  这不是闹着玩的
Boys, this is serious.

323
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,040
我们需要你们的帮助
We need your help.

324
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,610
我们得让人们走进影院  但...
We've got to get people into theaters, but...

325
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,690
怎么才能做到
How?

326
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,670
在大街上放电影
Show movies in the streets.

327
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,640
你还好吗  查理
You okay, Charlie?

328
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,930
周末有安排了吗
Taken care of this weekend?

329
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,940
-我要去看我姑妈  -听着真有意思
- I'm going to see my aunt. - Oh, that sounds like fun.

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,100
你显然不认识我姑妈
You obviously don't know my aunt.

331
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,850
你要是没什么事就一起来吧
If you're not doing anything, come along.

332
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,540
说话要小心  我可能真会来
Careful, I just might.

333
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,890
七点在格伦代尔车站  你愿意的话可以带上莎拉
Glendale station at 7:00. Bring Sara if you like.

334
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,440
-谁  -莎拉  不是你妻子吗
- Who? - Sara, isn't that your wife?

335
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,130
你是说可怜的莎拉啊
Oh, you mean Poor Sara.

336
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,310
不  她和孩子们还在东部
No, she and the kids are back East.

337
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,520
赫尔曼
Herman.

338
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,870
赫尔曼
Herman.

339
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,330
-赫尔曼  -查理
- Herman! - Charlie!

340
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,250
卡  下一场  谢谢
Cut! Next setup, please.

341
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,110
曼克怎么来了
What is Mank doing here?

342
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,650
-谁  -赫尔曼·曼凯维奇
- Who? - Herman Mankiewicz.

343
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,210
我认识他吗
Do I know him?

344
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,040
我们有部朗·钱尼主演的电影是他写的
He wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.

345
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,960
曼克
Mank!

346
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,820
萨尔伯格  天才小子
Thalberg, the boy genius.

347
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,050
真没想到会在这里见到你
I am shocked to see you here.

348
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,750
我也没想到自己会来这里  欧文
I'd be shocked to see me here, too, Irving,

349
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,970
我之前根本不知道这是哪
if only I knew where here was.

350
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,060
我们有部朗·钱尼主演的电影是你写的
You wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.

351
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,940
只是其中之一
Among many.

352
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,390
-你写了很多电影吗  -我只是编剧之一
- Pictures? - Writers.

353
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,220
在米高梅  电影是一项团队作业
At MGM, movies are a team sport.

354
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,530
可能这就是我在派拉蒙的原因吧
Which may be why I'm at Paramount.

355
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,430
派拉蒙什么时候开始不大批量用编剧了
Since when don't Paramount use writers by the truckload?

356
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,640
但大家都是一起开工  不搞车轮战
But all at once, not in relays.

357
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,330
这样没人需要独自背黑锅
Helps spread the blame around.

358
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,200
还记得我们的主席吗  路易·B·梅耶
You remember our chairman, Louis B. Mayer?

359
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,830
只闻其名
By reputation only.

360
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,000
-昨晚熬到很晚吗  -没有  被烈酒灌倒了
- Long night? - A short one. Plagued by spirits.

361
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,480
这样过安息日可太遭罪了  伙计们
A hell of a way to spend the Sabbath, fellas.

362
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,030
我们是来给一个朋友站台的
Here in support of a friend.

363
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,170
他的女主角正在职业生涯转型期
His leading lady is making a mid-career adjustment.

364
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,750
我要过去了
Ah, I'm on my way over.

365
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,640
监督帐篷这边有什么指导意见要带过去吗
Any notes from the oversight tent?

366
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,050
-他是谁来着  -就一个编剧
- Who was that again? - Just a writer.

367
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,340
周六还来过苦日子啊  梅特卡夫先生
Slumming on a Saturday, Mr. Metcalf?

368
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,120
曼克  不是的  我在帮B机位
Mank. No, sir, helping out on B camera.

369
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,020
这是部家庭电影  不过是他理解中的家庭电影
It's a home movie, but his idea of a home movie.

370
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,170
我认识你
I know you.

371
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,130
这是在演什么
Well, what's at stake here?

372
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,750
我们在约翰·吉尔伯特的生日宴上见过
We met at John Gilbert's birthday.

373
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
你是赫尔曼·曼凯维奇
You're Herman Mankiewicz.

374
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,550
我承认
Guilty.

375
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,460
我也记得你  戴维斯小姐
And I remember you, Miss Davies.

376
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,740
你讲的在布鲁克林躲有轨电车的故事可好笑了
Regaling us with stories about dodging trolley cars in Brooklyn.

377
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,760
还有你的布鲁克林口音
Your Flatbush was showing.

378
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,060
你跟沃利·比利角力时折断了他的手腕
You fractured Wally Beery's wrist Indian wrestling.

379
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,190
必须承认  运气不错
Admittedly, a lucky break.

380
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,030
天啊  他绝对没想到  你比看起来要强壮得多
Boy, was he surprised. You're stronger than you look.

381
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,000
而在我看来  你也比看起来要聪明得多
And from what I understand, you're smarter.

382
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,010
我那话可是在夸你
That was a compliment.

383
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,350
-瞧我说什么来着  -你很有意思
- See what I mean? - You are interesting.

384
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,540
我需要你帮个忙  但你得保证不笑
I need a favor, but you're gonna have to promise you won't laugh.

385
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
世界都这样了  这要求可有点难
Given the state of the world, a tall order.

386
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,010
你肯定会笑的  我知道你会
You're gonna. I just know you are.

387
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,070
我现在宿醉特别严重
I have got such a hangover right now,

388
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,230
有那么一丝可能我不会笑
there's just a fighting chance I won't.

389
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,960
我被绑在柱子上烧  而我却迫切想来支烟
I'm being burned at the stake, and I am dying for a ciggie-boo.

390
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,880
看吧  上帝在惩罚你
There. God's punishing you.

391
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,510
上楼梯要小心  它们很危险
Watch those stairs. They're treacherous.

392
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,260
我生命的每时每刻都有危险
Every moment of my life is treacherous.

393
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,640
有什么遗言吗
Any last words?

394
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,070
欢迎来到圣西蒙
Welcome to San Simeon.

395
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,220
-我写过更糟的台词  -你没来过吗
- I've written worse. - You've never seen it?

396
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,140
没有  但乔治·萧伯纳是对的
No, but George Bernard Shaw was right.

397
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,800
怎么说
How's that?

398
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,980
"如果上帝有钱  可能就会用来造这个"
"It's what God might've built had he had the money."

399
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,390
布朗克斯区有句名言
Well, as they say in the Bronx,

400
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,680
"到哪都是家"  曼凯维奇先生
"Make yourself to home," Mr. Mankiewicz.

401
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,860
-还是说我该叫你赫尔曼  -拜托  叫我曼克
- Or shall I call you Herman? - No. Please, call me Mank.

402
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,510
-早啊  查尔斯  -查理
- Good morning, - Charles. Charlie.

403
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,850
-玛丽安姑妈  曼克  -睡得还好吗
- Aunt Marion. Mank. - You sleep well?

404
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,260
在您颇有戏剧性的叫醒电话之前都挺好
Until your rather dramatic wake-up call.

405
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,880
都是老爹的主意
This is all Pops's idea.

406
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,200
他想让我准备好拍有声电影
He wants me ready to take on the talkies.

407
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,080
一号位
First positions!

408
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,420
骑手们  准备
Riders, ready!

409
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,480
开始摄影
Rolling!

410
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,890
快  快  开拍
Speed. Speed! Action!

411
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,130
救命  拜托  谁来救救我
Help! Please! Someone save me!

412
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,390
卡
Cut!

413
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,120
老爹  这是赫尔曼·曼凯维奇
Pops, this is Herman Mankiewicz,

414
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,230
不过我们得叫他曼克
but we have to call him Mank.

415
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,710
曼凯维奇
Mankiewicz?

416
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,560
赫尔曼·曼凯维奇  纽约剧作家及剧评家
Herman Mankiewicz, New York playwright and drama critic?

417
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,380
转行做卑微的电影编剧了  赫斯特先生
Turned humble screenwriter, Mr. Hearst.

418
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,620
为什么  没必要谦卑  曼凯维奇先生
Why, no need to be humble, Mr. Mankiewicz.

419
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,610
有声电影才是未来
Pictures that talk are the future.

420
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,760
他们会需要尊重文字的人来赋予他们声音
They're gonna need people who honor words, give them voice.

421
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,610
黄金时代很快会到来  而世界将成为一个大舞台
There's a golden age coming when all the world will be a stage,

422
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,780
而你也许就是他们的莎士比亚
and you, perhaps, their Shakespeare.

423
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,690
我可没想到
Oh, I wouldn't have thought

424
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,590
你会对尊重文字有这种热忱
you'd be that keenly interested in the honoring of words.

425
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,800
有什么好笑的
What's so funny?

426
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,630
我只是很吃惊  像你这样受吹捧的爆料人
I'm just surprised that a vaunted muckraker like yourself

427
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,130
会如此看好好莱坞的未来
sees Hollywood's future as such a shiny penny.

428
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,480
回到一号位
Back to one.

429
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,840
时代在变化  曼凯维奇先生
Times are changing, Mr. Mankiewicz,

430
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,660
我不只是指这次大萧条
and I'm not just referring to this Depression.

431
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,910
-大萧条可太糟了  -等一切结束
- All that bother. - And when all this is over,

432
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,690
电影从业者将服务于这种新兴娱乐产业
picture-makers are gonna have to service this new entertainment.

433
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,200
我希望有真正懂文学的人来帮我拍电影
I intend to make pictures with the help of real literary minds.

434
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,330
我支持这点
I support that.

435
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,600
然而  大部分制片厂在拍什么
Instead, what do most studios give us?

436
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,120
黑帮片  滑稽片
Gangster flicks, zanies.

437
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,200
太对了
Too true.

438
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,510
而美国人一辈子能见着几个黑帮分子
Now, how many gangsters do Americans meet in a lifetime?

439
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,230
有几个家庭能比得上马克思兄弟
How many families are like the Marx Brothers?

440
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,960
你是说除了我自己家吗
You mean besides my own?

441
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,160
有意思  安排他坐我旁边
Very good. Have him seated next to me.

442
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,470
戴维斯小姐  赫斯特先生想让曼凯维奇先生
Miss Davies, Mr. Hearst would like Mr. Mankiewicz seated

443
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,930
坐在他左边一起用晚餐
to his left at dinner.

444
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,630
老爹喜欢你
Oh, Pops likes you.

445
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,200
{\an8}线圈式护眼笔记本

446
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,790
为什么豪斯曼修改后
Why is it when Houseman edits,

447
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:19,120
人人说话都像个便秘的牛津教书匠
everyone ends up speaking like a constipated Oxford don?

448
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,700
你好
Hello?

449
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,160
他在  不会
Yes, he is. No, not at all.

450
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,660
请稍等  是可怜的莎...
Please hold on. It's Poor Sa...

451
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,040
抱歉  是你妻子
I'm sorry. It's your wife.

452
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,370
-施努兹  -我可听到了
- Schnutz. - I heard that.

453
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,660
赫曼  乔在过去三天打了四次电话
Hermie, Joe called four times in the last three days.

454
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,410
-他想要你在那边的号码  -那就给他啊
- He wants your number up there. - So give it to him.

455
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,450
消停点
Knock it off!

456
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,330
孩子们在重新装修
The boys are remodeling.

457
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,200
他好像有些担心  你没事吧
He seemed concerned about something. Is everything okay?

458
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,660
我简直一帆风顺
If I could swim, I'd be doing swimmingly.

459
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,990
别管乔
And don't mind Joe.

460
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,120
他内心就是个烦人的老妈子
He's a worrisome old woman in disguise.

461
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,490
他想给你份活儿干
Well, he wants to offer you work.

462
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,000
小乔给我找活儿干
Baby Joe offering me?

463
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,200
要是他再打电话  就给他这个号码  施努兹
Well, if he calls again, give him this number, Schnutz.

464
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,540
我得挂了  帮我亲亲孩子们
I've gotta run. Kiss the offspring.

465
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,910
是不是...
I say...

466
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,290
英勇的上尉寄来的信呀
A letter from the gallant "leftenant"?

467
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,450
但愿不像上一封那样狗屁不通
Now, let's hope it makes more sense than the last.

468
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,200
战斗机从航母的甲板上起飞
Fighters off the decks of aircraft carriers.

469
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,620
-这主意究竟是谁想出来的  -不好吗
- Whoever had that idea? - It's not good?

470
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
还"不好"
Not good?

471
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,240
德国的潜艇开始成群结队地出击
German U-boats are starting to hunt in packs,

472
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,240
而斯图卡式俯冲轰炸机
and a Stuka dive-bomber can drop one

473
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,950
能从150米的空中投弹
down your stack from 500 feet.

474
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,540
我们英勇的小伙子有什么要说的...
What's our valiant laddie have to say for the cause...

475
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,120
不是她丈夫寄的
It's not from her husband.

476
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,750
他的军舰在挪威附近被击沉了
His ship's been sunk off Norway.

477
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,830
推断在海上失踪了
Presumed lost at sea.

478
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,620
总是管不住嘴抖机灵
Always the smartest guy in the room.

479
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,450
当然  你说得对
You're right, of course.

480
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,540
航母确实是个糟糕透顶的主意
Aircraft carriers are a shitty idea,

481
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,790
但我不喜欢这种冷酷无情
but I don't appreciate the callousness.

482
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
我还以为你是个体面人
I expect more of you.

483
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,910
"推断"说明他们还没确定
"Presumed" means they don't know,

484
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,450
所以我选择相信他依然活着  直到...
so I choose to believe he's alive until...

485
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,370
曼克
Mank.

486
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,790
曼克
Mank!

487
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,450
曼凯维奇先生
Mr. Mankiewicz?

488
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,080
他没事  就是睡着了
He's all right. Just sleeping.

489
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,040
好吧...
Well...

490
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,950
我并不惊奇
I shouldn't wonder.

491
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,540
一小瓶里的安眠药
There's enough Seconal in those little bottles

492
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,580
就足够撂倒一头发情的公象
to bring down a bull elephant in heat.

493
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,330
年轻的奥森不想冒险
Young Orson doesn't believe in chance.

494
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,040
豪斯曼  你够狡猾的  你给我下了药
Houseman, you sly thing. You slipped me a Mickey.

495
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,120
没错
So we did.

496
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,990
你还在恢复初期  怎么就馋酒了
How you managed to reach it so early in your rehabilitation,

497
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,160
我无法想象
I cannot imagine.

498
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,330
怎么样  母乳一样好喝吗
How was it? Mother's milk?

499
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,490
总之好过什么都没有  我打算拿它当睡前酒
On balance, better than nothing. I plan to use it as a nightcap.

500
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,790
就像你们美国佬说的  "他倒头就睡着了"
As you Yanks say, "He went out like a light."

501
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,450
我都无法形容得这么贴切  亚夫人
I couldn't have put it better myself, Mrs. A,

502
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,490
可能正因如此我才给电影写剧本
which may be why I write for the movies.

503
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,910
你别说了
Will you stop?

504
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,790
你给电影写剧本是因为你擅长
You write for the movies because you're super at it.

505
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,040
二位失陪了  我有好多字要打
Excuse me, you two, I've masses of typing to do.

506
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,740
76页
Seventy-six pages.

507
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,830
等她辨识清楚你那像鸡爪写的一样的字
By the time she translates your red chicken scratches,

508
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,290
就剩下不到40页
it'll be less than 40.

509
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,830
按这个速度下去  你永远都写不完
At this rate, you'll never finish.

510
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,660
我想知道你觉得怎么样
What I wanna know is what you think of it.

511
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,290
你写的当然是一流的  这你知道
Of course, the writing is first-rate, but you know that.

512
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,160
他对权力的渴望
His lust for power,

513
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,240
还有你巧妙地通过那些害怕他阴暗面的人
your exquisite evocation of his hunger for love

514
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,160
来描写他对爱的渴望  但是...
from those who fear his worst side, but...

515
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,330
那个可怕但可预见的"但是"
The dreaded yet foreseeable "but."

516
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,200
你对电影观众的要求太高了
You're asking a lot of a motion picture audience.

517
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,950
总的来说有点混乱
All in all, it's a bit of a jumble.

518
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,490
你说"混乱"还是"丛林"
Did you say "jumble" or "jungle"?

519
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,200
各种话唠的情节大杂烩
A hodgepodge of talky episodes.

520
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,740
在时间线上跳来跳去的一堆碎片
A collection of fragments that leap around in time,

521
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,290
像墨西哥跳豆一样
like Mexican jumping beans.

522
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,910
欢迎来到我的脑内世界  老兄
Welcome to my mind, Old Sock.

523
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,120
故事太散了  恐怕观众需要地图才能看懂
The story is so scattered, I'm afraid one will need a road map.

524
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,750
你是说它一团糟
You mean it's a mess.

525
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,290
你能不能简化一下
Would you consider simplifying?

526
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,040
帕斯卡曾经说过
As Pascal once said,

527
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,910
"我要是时间更充裕
"If only I'd had more time,

528
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,490
就会写一封更短的信"
I would have written a shorter letter."

529
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,200
我只想说  没人能那样写
All I am saying is no one can write like that.

530
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,080
但我就能  豪斯曼  我已经那样写了
But I can write like that, Houseman. I have.

531
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,290
叙事就是一个大圆圈  像一个肉桂卷
The narrative is one big circle, like a cinnamon roll,

532
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,830
而不是一条直指最近出口的直线
not a straight line pointing to the nearest exit.

533
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,410
一个人的一生在两小时内是刻画不完的
You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours.

534
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,870
你只能寄希望于留个大概印象
All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.

535
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,870
但没人想看莎士比亚式的作品
But nobody expects Shakespeare.

536
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,620
观众花辛苦挣来的25分钱  不是为了看《麦克白》
People aren't spending their hard-earned 25 cents to see Macbeth.

537
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,160
‎那个长着一张狗脸的大师就拍了《麦克白》
Maestro the Dog-Faced Boy did Macbeth.

538
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,330
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}奥森·威尔斯拍了全黑人版的《麦克白》
将原本的苏格兰背景换成后革命时期的海地小岛
剧中增添巫毒祭祀中的唱跳击鼓

539
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,330
是"巫毒麦克白"  别被骗了  他就爱出风头
Voodoo Macbeth. Don't be fooled. He's a showman.

540
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,830
一个耍把戏自我陶醉的街头艺人
Busker reveling in sleight of hand.

541
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,290
别自找麻烦  60天之内写完
Save yourself the trouble, be done in 60 days.

542
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,870
他会看懂的  观众也会
He'll get this, and the audience will too.

543
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,080
别担心了  吃点腌黄瓜
Stop worrying. Have a pickle.

544
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,040
不了  谢谢  我不饿
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

545
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,160
自从我们到这儿我还没饿过
Haven't been since we got here.

546
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,620
再见
Cheerio.

547
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,290
埋头写  降低目标
Write hard. Aim low.

548
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,870
上次说到哪里了  长官
Where were we, chief?

549
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,000
你要怎么办
What are you gonna do?

550
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,460
-什么怎么办  -他说得对
- About what? - He's right.

551
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,830
你到圣诞节才能写完
You won't be done till Christmas.

552
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,080
-什么  -你答应过的
- What? - You made a promise.

553
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,450
-我什么  -60天只剩下两周了
- I did what? - Sixty days is two weeks from now.

554
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,580
上次说到哪里了
Where were we?

555
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,620
伯恩斯坦的独白  那个渡轮上的年轻女子
Bernstein's speech, the young woman on the ferry boat.

556
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,120
麻烦读给我听
Read it back, please.

557
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,000
"她身着白裙  撑着白阳伞
"A white dress she had on, and she was carrying a white parasol,

558
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,250
我只看到她一眼  她根本没看到我
and I only saw her for one second, and she didn't see me at all."

559
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,950
但那之后的一个月
"But I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since

560
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,040
我无时无刻不想着那姑娘"
that I haven't thought of that girl."

561
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,950
是曼凯维奇家族相册中的一幕吗
A snapshot from the Mankiewicz family album?

562
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,330
算是吧
You might say that.

563
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,660
真的很美...
It really is a gorgeous...

564
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,500
在这里卡住很美
Spot to get stuck?

565
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,990
伯恩斯坦的原型是路易·梅耶吗
Is Bernstein meant to be Louis Mayer?

566
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,620
如果形式服从功能的话
If form follows function.

567
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,450
梅耶是条可悲的哈巴狗  奉承我们的查尔斯·福斯特吗
Mayer is the same pathetic sort of lap dog to our Charles Foster?

568
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,080
伯恩斯坦这角色比他好多了
Bernstein is a far nicer character.

569
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,040
你不怎么喜欢梅耶
You don't much like Mayer.

570
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,660
我要是有朝一日上了电椅
If I ever go to the electric chair,

571
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,830
我很希望他坐在我腿上
I'd like him to be sitting in my lap.

$750 a week? That's half what you make, Herman.

574

- You look like you. Fine. - What should I be expecting?

-行了  -你好
- Enough. - Good day.

The job will be yours if you can do two things.

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,540
一  别翻白眼  二  尽量别睡着
One, don't roll your eyes. Two, try not to fall asleep.

582
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,410
这里又不是好莱坞的高尔峡谷
This isn't Gower Gulch.

583
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,790
你想让我拍一部讲妓女的电影
You want I should make a picture about a prostitute?

584
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,830
那有什么不好
What's wrong with that?

585
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,660
我妈就是一个不折不扣的婊子
My mother was nothing but a whore.

586
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,620
你怎能那么说你自己的亲生母亲
You would talk about your own mother that way?

587
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,910
那个给了你生命的女人
The woman who gave you life?

588

你个忘恩负义的混蛋  我要割了你的卵蛋
You ungrateful bastard! I ought to cut your balls off!

Nice to meet you, Joseph. I'm Louis Mayer.

{\an8}米高梅电影公司

595
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,370
孩子  这家制片厂有三条工作守则
My boy, there are three work rules at this studio.

596
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,080
第一条  为艺术而艺术
Rule number one. Ars gratia artis, art for art's sake.

597
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,870
你好
How you doing?

598
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,040
我们每年花在
One million dollars a year

599
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,540
不会拍的剧本上的钱高达一百万美元
we spend on stories we never even film.

600
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,330
为什么呢  我告诉你  它们没法让我哭
Why not? I'll tell you. They don't make me cry.

601
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,870
什么能让我哭呢  情感
What makes me cry? Emotion.

602
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,080
我哪里能感受到情感
Where do I feel emotion?

603
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,660
这里  这里还有这里
Here, here, and here.

604
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,910
第二条
Rule number two.

605
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,620
你可能听说过  米高梅的明星
You may have heard MGM has more stars

606
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,080
比天上的星星还多
than there are in the heavens.

607
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,410
-别信  -梅耶先生
- Do not believe this. - Mr. Mayer.

608
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,330
你好  我们只有一位明星  雄狮利奥
Hiya. We have only one star. That is Leo the Lion.

609
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,660
千万别忘了
Never forget that.

610
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,830
许多明星忘记了  所以他们现在在别处闪耀
Many stars have, and now they twinkle elsewhere.

611
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,870
第三条
Rule number three.

612
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,370
大家以为米高梅是米措-高文-梅耶的缩写
People think MGM stands for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

613
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,740
其实不是的
It does not.

614
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,370
是梅耶大家庭的意思
It stands for Mayer's gantze mishpokhe, Mayer's whole family.

615
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,700
千万别忘了
Never forget that.

616
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,000
有问题  找爸爸
You got a problem, come to Papa.

617
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,160
我们这一行  买家出钱
This is a business where the buyer

618
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,740
只能买到一段回忆
gets nothing for his money but a memory.

619
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,540
他买下的东西依然属于卖家
What he bought still belongs to the man who sold it.

620
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,120
这就是电影的真正魔力
That's the real magic of the movies,

621
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,330
其他人讲别的  你信都别信
and don't let anybody tell you different.

622
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
我现在身陷困境
I find myself in a horrendous position,

623
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,910
我只好跪求各位
and I come to all of you on bended knee.

624
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,620
跟所有美国人一样  我们在受苦
We are suffering, as all Americans are,

625
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,660
因为我国的经济不景气
from our country's terrible economic woes.

626
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,450
普通老百姓没钱看电影
Good people, everyday people, can't afford to go to the movies.

627
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,450
所以就连我们卓越的梦工厂
So even our preeminent dream factory...

628
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,120
都面对着深重的财务困境
is in grave financial difficulty.

629
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,700
我恳请米高梅大家庭的每一位
I am asking everyone in the MGM family

630
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,910
迈出沉痛的一步
to take a painful step.

631
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,540
我请求给各位减薪
I am asking to roll back salaries.

632
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,580
我也不想
I don't want to,

633
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:55,830
但为了让这个神圣的地方继续存在  我不得不这样
but for this hallowed place to continue to exist, I am forced to.

634
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,660
我不愿意因为钱这种事而拆散这个家
I won't break up this family over something like money.

635
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,990
-要减薪多久  -应该不久
- How long are you asking for? - Shouldn't be long.

636
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,370
-要减多少  -一半
- How much are you asking for? - Half.

637
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,700
-一半  -可能不到一半
- Half? - Could be less.

638
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,290
所有人都减吗  你减吗  梅耶先生
Is everybody going to be pitching in? Are you, Mr. Mayer?

639
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,080
真正的家人在顺境中相互扶持
Real families root for each other in the good times,

640
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,580
在逆境中相互照应
take care of each other in tough ones.

641
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,120
我们跟你一条心  LB
We're with you, L.B.

642
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,540
你也许是跟他一条心了  巴里摩尔
You may be, Mr. Barrymore,

643
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,120
但是给器械工和电工减薪一半...
but a 50% pay cut for grips and electricians...

644
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,620
八周  朋友们  就短短的八周
Eight weeks, my friends, eight short weeks.

645
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,120
一旦罗斯福重开银行  就把钱都补给你们
As soon as FDR reopens the banks, you'll get back every penny.

646
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,000
这一点  LB·梅耶
On that, you have the sacred word

647
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,830
向你们郑重保证
of L.B. Mayer.

648
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,290
我赞成
Well, I vote yes.

649
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,830
-我也赞成  -我也是
- I do as well. - Me too.

650
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,950
-我讲得怎么样  本  -很棒  梅耶先生
- How'd I do, Ben? - It was great, Mr. Mayer.

651
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,660
这还算不上我见过的最可耻的事
Not even the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen.

652
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,120
好
Good.

653
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,650
好

行吗  好
Yeah? Okay.

656
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,660
稍微往左一点儿
Maybe a little bit left?

657
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,540
-行吗  -行
- Yeah? - Yeah.

658
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,330

-对  -我得快点进城买打字机色带
- Yeah. - I've got to rush to town to get typewriter ribbon.

660

-这是今早的剧本  -垃圾  全是垃圾
- Here are this morning's pages. - Dreck. It's all dreck!

661
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,240
别妄自菲薄  至少你又开始写了
Don't flagellate. At least you're writing again.

662
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,200
没有一句能唱  一个音都唱不出来
None of it sings. None of it. Not a note.

663
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,750
你又不是在写歌剧
You're not writing an opera.

664
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
喂
Hello?

665
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,250
可我的确在写歌剧
But I am writing an opera.

666
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,910

It's for you.

667
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,740
-喂  -赫尔曼  我是乔

你好啊  小伙子  有事吗
Hey, hey, kid. What's up?

-问问你的情况  你适应得如何  -如履薄冰
- Checking in. How are you getting around? - Gingerly.

- Any rest? - Haven't seen a sunrise yet.

671
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,540
你从来也没见过日出
You've never seen a sunrise.

672
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,480
莎拉说你特意要了这个号码
Sara said you wanted this number.

673
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,830
想听听你的声音
Just to hear your voice.

674
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,790
她说你有工作上的事想和我谈谈
She said you had some work you wanted to talk about.

675
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,410
我在想那个老剧本
I was thinking about that old play,

676
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,700
《婆罗洲的野人》
The Wild Man of Borneo,

677
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,830
你好久之前写的那个
the one you wrote in the Ice Age.

678
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,370
人从不记得自己糟糕的作品  那个剧本太粗糙了
One never remembers one's disasters. It's considered gauche.

679
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,790
剧本被搬上大荧幕
A play is never a disaster

我拿给工作室的人看了看
I brought it to my people at the studio.

682
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,290
我们想请WC·菲尔兹出演
We want W.C. Fields.

683
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,870
还想请你为电影改编剧本
And we want you to adapt.

684
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,620
我现在手头在忙别的事
I'm kind of on something right now.

685
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,790
我可以付你剧本和改编的报酬
I can get you paid for the play and the adaptation.

686
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,580
听着不错
Sounds great.

687
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,740
但我得考虑考虑
But I'll have to think about it.

688
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,490
你知道这种事很看时机吧
You know how these things have their moment.

689
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,500
原来你不是邀请我  而是含蓄的最后通牒
So this isn't an offer. It's a subtle ultimatum.

690
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,830
没人能指挥得动你
Nobody could ever tell you what to do.

691
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,910
是莎拉让你来问我的吗
Did Sara put you up to this?

692
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,620
没有的事  但我清楚你的情况
Not at all, but I know how things are.

693
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,120
我能从她声音里听出来
I can tell by her voice.

694
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,160
-情况有多糟  我的弟弟  -有多糟
- And how bad is that, baby brother? - How bad?

695
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,540
我昨晚去了场派对
I went to a party last night

696
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,410
斯科特·菲茨杰拉德在派对上说你无药可救
where Scott Fitzgerald referred to you as a ruined man.

697
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,490
情况就是这么糟
That's how bad things can get.

698
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,330
这话不错  我可能用得上
That's good. I may use that.

00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,540
-赫米...  -别试探了  乔伊
- Hermie... - Please, stop, Joey.

700
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,540
有什么话就直说吧
Just tell me what's on your mind.

701
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,910
我听说你在打危险人物的主意
I hear you're hunting dangerous game.

How stupid of me.

我以为我是不食嗟来之食
I thought I was rejecting a humiliating handout,

可原来我是在拒绝一笔贿赂
when all the time, I was nixing a respectable bribe.

00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,910
说到社会党人  厄普顿·辛克莱的书呢
Speaking of socialists, how about Upton Sinclair's book?

805
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:21,410
别提了
No!

806
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,080
他想把私有企业都移交给加利福尼亚州政府
He wants to turn private enterprise over to the state of California.

807
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,790
这本书我们肯定不会改编电影  是吧欧文
There's one we won't be optioning. Eh, Irving?

808
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,450
这本书卖得火极了
Well, it's selling like crazy.

809
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,410
沃尔特·温切尔说辛克莱可能会竞选下一任州长
Walter Winchell says Sinclair may run for governor next election.

810
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:33,450
那个激进分子和希特勒一样
That rat Bolshevik belongs right up there with Hitler

811
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,120
不用把他们当真
on the list of people not to be taken seriously.

812
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,620
共产主义和社会主义之间有巨大的鸿沟
There's a world of difference between communism and socialism.

813
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,450
他们都想空手套白狼
They both want something for nothing.

814
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,290
比如免费劳动力
Like a workforce for free?

815
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,120
半价  而且只是暂时的
Half, and only in the interim.

816
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,620
毋庸置疑  我们之中没人会
I think it's safe to assume none of us here would welcome

817
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,040
欢迎像加州政治救世主这种社会主义改革者
a crusading socialist as California's political savior.

818
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,290
至少罗斯福总统不会  对吧雷克斯
Certainly not FDR. Am I right, Rex?

819
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,290
私下而言  总统说这人值得关注
Off the record, President says the man bears watching.

820
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,910
尤其当下共和党
Especially now that Republicans

821
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,740
似乎执意让弗兰克·梅里亚姆再次竞选
seem bent on running Frank Merriam again.

822
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,740
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}加利福尼亚州第28任州长

823
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,330
辛克莱竞选过两次  才获得2%的票吧
Sinclair's run twice before and got, what, 2% of the vote?

824
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:05,680
-各位  他就是个作家  -托马斯·杰斐逊也是作家
- Good people, the man is an author. - As was Thomas Jefferson.

825
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,200
得了吧  曼克
Come now, Mank.

826
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,520
厄普顿·辛克莱能与托马斯·杰斐逊相提并论吗
Upton Sinclair as Thomas Jefferson?

827
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,790
你说得对  WR
No, you're right, W.R.

828
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,120
杰弗逊从未通过联邦法律来禁止石油垄断
Jefferson never got federal laws passed to ban oil monopolies,

829
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,910
或者铁路信托  也没清理过畜牧场
or railroad trusts, or cleaned up the stockyards.

830
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,910
他是个愤怒的作家  一个煽动者
He's an angry scribe, a provocateur.

831
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,660
因为他激发思想
Because he provokes thought.

832
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,910
你总是和作家站一边  曼克
You always side with the writer, Mank.

833
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,200
大萧条期间  苦命的人们每周只靠五千块过活
Poor souls surviving a depression on five grand a week.

834
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,790
-共产党  -LB说得没错
- Commies. - L.B. is not wrong.

835
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,620
欧文  你是有学问的人
Irving, you're a literate man.

836
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,410
你肯定知道共产主义与社会主义间的区别
You know the difference between communism and socialism.

837
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,870
社会主义下  大家一起富
In socialism, everyone shares the wealth.

838
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,620
而共产主义下  大家一起穷
In communism, everyone shares the poverty.

839
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,580
谢谢你的解释  曼凯维奇先生
Thank you, Mr. Mankiewicz.

840
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,490
厄普顿只是想让你
Upton just wants you to apportion

841
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,870
把圣诞节奖金分出去一点  欧文
some of your Christmas bonus, Irving,

842
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,120
给你家的清洁工
to the people who clean your house.

843
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,530
-要不说喜欢有曼克在呢  -我也是
- Now that's why I always want Mank around. - Me too.

844
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,620
厄普顿  曼克
Upton, Mank?

845
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,830
没人要求你唱《国际歌》
Nobody's asking to hear you sing "The Internationale."

846
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,200
-那是什么  -共产党的国歌  亲爱的
- What's that? - The Communist national anthem, darling.

847
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,330
我想听  你会唱吗
I would. Do you sing?

848
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,040
没人该受我歌声的折磨  对吧  莎拉
No one should have to hear me sing. Isn't that right, Sara?

849
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,540
能免则免
If at all possible.

850
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,450
作为加州共和党主席
As Republican state chairman-elect,

851
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,990
我告诉你  这里什么都不会发生
I'm telling you, nothing's going to happen here.

852
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,540
加州的大人物不会允许这种事发生
The people who count in California won't let it.

853
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,450
这么多争论都是白费口舌
All this talk is so much pissing in the wind.

854
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,450
说得好
Nicely put.

855
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,950
我听见老爹在电话里帮忙挑选总统内阁
I heard Pops on the phone helping to pick the president's cabinet

856
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,660
就像电影选角一样
like casting a movie.

857
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,990
他们肯定能阻止辛克莱这种人
They can stop a guy like Sinclair.

858
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,370
不是吗  老爹
Couldn't you, Pops?

859
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,040
抱歉
Pardon.

860
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
我胡言乱语罢了
I don't know what I'm saying.

861
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
去吧
Go.

862
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,370
东京  在吗
Hello, Tokyo?

863
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,750
伦敦  在吗
London, you there?

864
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,700
-瞎扯  -那是什么
- Ah, nerts! - What is that?

865
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,740
老爹的无线电话
Pops's radio-phones.

866
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,290
永远不能与你的帝国失联
Never ever be out of touch with your empire.

867
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,790
不  "瞎扯"是什么意思
No, no. What's "nerts"?

868
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,450
就是布鲁克林人的"胡说"
Nerts is Brooklynese for "nuts."

869
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,950
天呐
Jeepers!

870
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,620
我做了什么过分的事吗
What did I do that was so terrible?

871
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,490
我想我不该
I guess I shouldn't have said that thing

872
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,040
当着特格韦尔的面说内阁的事
about the cabinet in front of Tugwell,

873
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,620
但大家什么时候在乎过我说的话
but since when does anybody care what I have to say?

874
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,990
有时候话到了嘴边拦不住
Those things just pop out of my mouth,

875
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,540
那一刻  我感觉...
and the moment they do, I feel like...

876
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
像是被捉了个现行
Like you got caught, jambes en I'air.

877
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,290
不
No!

878
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,500
难道你总是肆意畅言吗
Well, do you always just say whatever you think?

879
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,080
你脸红了
You're blushing.

880
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,830
-没有  -就是有
- Am not. - Are too.

881
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,410
-没有  -就是有
- Am not. - Are too.

882
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,950
即使天色已晚  我还是能看出来
I can see it even in the dark.

883
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,580
我能说什么呢  曼克  玛丽安·杜拉斯...
Well, what can I tell you, Mank? Marion Douras...

884
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,830
上的是女子教会学校
Went to convent school.

885
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,540
赫达  卢埃拉
Hedda! Louella!

886
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,540
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}赫达·霍珀和卢埃拉·帕森斯
二人同为知名八卦专栏作家

887
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,910
这城堡附近的八卦专栏作家呢
Where's a gossip columnist around this castle

888
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,040
关键时刻找不见人
when you need one?

889
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,450
我讨厌谈论公事  我永远搞不清他们在说什么
I hate shop talk. I never know what's going on.

890
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,580
有一点千万不能提的是厄普顿·辛克莱
The one thing you never ever talk about is Upton Sinclair.

891
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,910
我注意到了
I noted.

892
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,540
提到他的时候  气氛瞬间冷了下来
The moment he's mentioned, the evening turns.

893
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,660
-那是令人难堪的敏感话题  -是吗
- It's sort of a sore subject. - Really?

894
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,870
说说看
Do tell.

895
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,540
我连这位辛克莱先生是谁都不知道
I don't even know who this Mr. Sinclair is,

896
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,700
不过他在一本书里写了我们
but he wrote about us for a book.

897
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,500
我以前常一字不差地引用他
I used to quote it word for word.

898
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:54,570
"我目睹我们最富有的报纸出版商把他的电影演员情妇
"I saw our richest newspaper publisher keep his movie mistress

899
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,660
养在满是宫殿和城堡的私有城市里
in a private city of palaces and cathedrals,

900
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,580
这里到处都是从欧洲进口的垃圾装饰
furnished with shiploads of junk imported from Europe

901
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,790
周围是大片的土地
and surrounded by vast acres

902
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,910
供斑马和长颈鹿奔跑其中
reserved for use by zebras and giraffes,

903
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,830
他会开玩笑说自己花了六百万美元
telling in jest that he had spent six million dollars

904
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,950
帮他的情妇打造名声
to make his lady's reputation

905
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,450
还用自己的报纸吹捧她一套又一套的装扮"
and using his newspapers to celebrate her change of hats."

906
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,040
被人这样写一定很不好受
It must be hard to be on the receiving end of that.

907
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,620
人们在《现代银幕》的封面上看见过你
People think because you're on the cover of Modern Screen,

908
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,540
就自以为了解你
they know you.

909
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,540
瞎说  我哪有什么好抱怨的
Nerts! What do I have to complain about?

910
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,620
虽然我住在鱼缸里  但我想要什么都能得到
I live in a fishbowl, but anything I want is mine.

911
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,820
如果可以  我愿意跟所有人分享
If I could, I'd share with everyone.

912
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,330
你知道的  曼克
You know that, Mank.

913
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,870
这位厄普顿丝毫不了解真实的...
This Upton doesn't know a thing about the real...

914
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,790
谁都不能把威廉·伦道夫·赫斯特
Nobody but nobody makes a monkey

915
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,540
当猴子一样耍
out of William Randolph Hearst!

916
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,750
-我能理解为什么梅耶恨他  -为什么
- I understand why Mayer loathes him. - Why?

917
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,120
-辛克莱发现了他的干的坏事  -天啊
-Sinclair caught him with his pants down. -Yikes!

918
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,950
他写了梅耶受了贿睁一只眼闭一只眼
He wrote that Mayer took a bribe to look the other way

919
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,540
允许对手收购米高梅
so a rival could buy MGM.

920
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,160
-这事很复杂  -你觉得我听不懂吗
- It's complicated. - Over my head?

921
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,330
不  是我不懂  盗窃专家才能搞懂
No, over mine. You'd need a degree in larceny.

922
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,540
-贿赂难道不是犯罪吗  -辛克莱就是这么说的
- Isn't bribery a crime? - That's what Sinclair said.

923
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,490
小矮子本来可能要进监狱的
The little sausage might have gone to jail.

924
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,990
天啊
Jeepers!

925
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,830
真虚伪
The hypocrisy.

926
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,910
"我的大家庭  我的家庭"
"Mayn gantze mishpokhe. My mishpokhe."

927
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,750
-我不太会说犹太人的语言  -真的吗
- I don't speak a lot of Jewish. - Really?

928
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,410
是"我的家庭"的意思
"My mishpokhe. My family."

929
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,950
他做的一切都是为了家人
Everything he does is for family,

930
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,200
除了他三更半夜把自己的公司
except when it comes to selling his last name

931
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,040
卖给竞争对手的时候
to a competitor in the middle of the night.

932
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,080
他竟然会那么对待自己的制片公司吗
He would do that to his own studio?

933
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,740
他和萨姆·高德温一样  只是股东而已
He doesn't own MGM any more than Sam Goldwyn.

00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:53,750
弗雷达  你不能让他吓唬你
Freda, you mustn't let him intimidate you.

1065
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,050
-我不怕他  亚历山大女士  -那你为什么这么做
- I am not intimidated, Frau Alexander. - Then, why?

1066
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,430
曼克先生资助了我一家人来到这个国家
Herr Mank sponsored my family's entry into this country.

1067
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,890
是他提供经济和法律支持
He's responsible for us getting

1068
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,960
让我们能安全离开德国
safely out of Germany, legally and financially.

1069
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,550
-真的吗  -他把我们整个村子的人都带来了美国
- Really? - Our entire village, he brought here.

1070
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,610
-整个村子吗  -一百多人
- Entire village? - Over 100 people.

1071
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,020
宣传部长约瑟夫·戈培尔
Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister,

1072
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,190
禁止他的电影在德国上映
will not allow his films to be shown in the Fatherland.

1073
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,860
我都不知道
I didn't realize.

1074
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,080
他写了个关于纳粹的电影剧本
He wrote a picture about the Nazis,

1075
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,840
没有一个制片公司敢拍
which no studio anywhere will dare make.

1076
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:37,210
他是个成年人  是个好人  如果他想喝酒
I assume if he wishes to drink, he's a grown man, a good man,

1077
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,700
那就应该满足他
and should be treated as such.

1078
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:41,890
不是吗
Nicht wahr?

1079
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,980
敬被你拯救的曼克镇  或是曼克村
To Mank-town. Or is it Mank-ville?

1080
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,050
弗雷达真是好样的
Dear Freda.

1081
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,280
大嘴巴用德语怎么说
What's German for blabbermouth?

1082
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,550
要么你好好表现
Either you demonstrate you can handle this,

1083
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,430
要么我们全都被解雇
or we will all end up getting sacked.

1084
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:11,670
有同伴的信任真是再好不过了
There's nothing like a vote of confidence from one's peers.

1085
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:14,190
敬曼克堡  祝你健康
To Mank-berg. Prosit.

1086
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,950
是曼克城  干杯
Mank-heim. Bottoms up.

1089
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,410
曼克  你还记得我吗
Mank, you remember me?

1090
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,790
天呐  我当然记得你  CC
Oh, my God. Of course I remember you, C.C.

1091
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,850
CC是选角部的简称  你最近怎么样  曼克
C.C. For Central Casting. How you been, Mank?

1092
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,820
发生什么了
What happened?

1093
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,250
发生什么了  发生了该死的大萧条
What happened? The goddamn Depression happened.

1094
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,180
《安妮号拖轮》之后我连跑龙套的角色都拿不到
I ain't had so much as a walk-on since Tugboat Annie.

1095
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,660
我也不想开口...
Listen. I hate to, you know...

1096
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,080
爱德  借我一块钱
Uh, yeah. Ed, lend me a buck.

1097
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,090
我和格雷迪在考虑向东去迈阿密
Uh, me and Grady here been thinking of bummin' east to Miami.

1098
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,740
有个知情人告诉我说
I heard it from someone who knows,

1099
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,840
好莱坞的制片公司要搬去佛罗里达州了
the Hollywood studios are movin' to Florida.

1100
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,160
-谁跟你说的  -我不能告诉你
- Who told you that? - Oh, I can't say.

1101
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,330
反正是有内幕的人
Somebody in the know.

1102
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,560
在某些阶层中  这是常识
In certain echelons, it's common knowledge.

1103
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,470
这些阶层中的人
Well, people in certain echelons

1104
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:21,490
通常不会放心把敏感信息告诉我
don't usually trust me with sensitive information.

1105
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,350
但制片厂不会搬走
But the studios aren't moving anywhere.

1106
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,820
那只是公司城镇的宣传而已
That's just company-town propaganda.

1107
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,680
随你怎么想  但是
Believe what you want, but say,

1108
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,190
你还能再给点吗
you think you could spare?

1109
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,060
爱德
Ed?

1110
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,830
上帝保佑你  曼克
Bless you, Mank.

1111
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,310
那混蛋食言了  你当时也在
The bastard reneged. You were there.

1112
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,110
是的  他恢复了发薪
Yes, he reinstated salaries,

1113
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,420
但他从未还回他承诺给的钱
but he never gave back the money he promised.

1114
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,740
真是太意外了
Giant surprise.

1115
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,390
拜托  曼克  我们需要像你这样的人
Come on, Mank. We need guys

1116
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,670
能让梅耶这样的人诚实待人
like you to keep people like Mayer honest.

1117
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,220
为此  我推荐你了解一下祈祷的力量
I'd refer you, for that, to the power of prayer.

1118
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,100
编剧协会没必要因为
The Writers Guild doesn't have to hit the bricks

1119
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,030
周薪2500的人而罢工
for the $2,500-a-week guy.

1120
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,310
我们是为了周薪250美元的人
We're doing it for the $250-a-week guy.

1121
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,570
乔  我认识的所有周薪250美元的编剧
Joe, all the $250-a-week writers I know

1122
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,610
都要赚到2500了
are getting $2,500.

1123
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,710
别为了你抛弃的阶层哭喊
Stop crying for your just deserts,

1124
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,110
不让他们会让你好看的
or they're liable to give them to you.

1125
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:07,270
然后我们就要跌到周薪75美元了
Then we'll all be working for 75 bucks a week.

1126
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,800
我不知道你有没有
I don't know if you've

1127
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,130
参与过罢工人墙  你可能得去看看
ever walked a picket line. You might have to.

1128
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:11,920
戴夫·蔡森会满足你的
And Dave Chasen will cater.

1129
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,650
"初级编剧一周薪水只有750"
"Junior writers only paid $750 a week."

1130
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,790
如果真变成这样  你最好快逃
If that happens, you'd better run

1131
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,720
免得真正生活困顿的人用石头砸死你
before real folk with real troubles stone you to death.

1132
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:26,000
赫米  工会才刚起步
Hermie, the guild's in its infancy.

1133
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,890
-它需要你  -这还用你说
- It needs you. - You're telling me.

1134
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,690
这世上居然有编剧
What writer failed to notice

1135
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:32,530
注意不到"电影编剧工会"里缺了个撇号
the Screen Writers Guild needs an apostrophe?

1136
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:34,840
就像格劳乔常说的
As Groucho always said,

1137
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,330
"永远不要加入任何
"Never belong to any club

1138
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,580
会接纳你这种会员的俱乐部"
that would have someone like you for a member."

1139
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,560
看看他
And look at him.

1140
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,790
这世上最可悲的混蛋
The most miserable bastard on God's green earth.

1141
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,270
我会转告他的  但他会以为你在拍马屁
I'd tell him you said that, only he'd think you were brownnosing.

1142
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,400
{\an8}米高梅电影公司

1143
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,920
把门关上
Close the door.

1144
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,230
夏天啊
Summer.

1145
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,560
伊内兹  永远都不要
Inez, you are not to let

1146
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,590
让马克斯兄弟在我办公室等
the Brothers Marx wait in my office. Ever.

1147
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,310
他们又烤热狗
They've been grilling hot dogs again.

1148
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,720
坐吧
Sit down.

1149
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:33,850
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

1150
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:36,550
我其实不在乎  但你为什么不给
Not that I care, but why aren't you contributing

1151
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:38,620
米高梅的反辛克莱基金捐款
to MGM's anti-Sinclair fund?

1152
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,780
你可以说我老派  欧文  但我不喜欢
Well, call me old-fashioned, Irving, but I don't like being told

1153
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,930
被被人安排自己要站哪队
which side of a fight I'm already on.

1154
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,250
如果共和党主席本人都得不到
How's it gonna look if the GOP chairman himself

1155
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,720
自己制片厂的一致支持  那该多难堪
can't get unanimous support from his own studio?

1156
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,530
你没开玩笑
You're serious.

1157
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,040
我父母教导我要直截了当
I was taught by my parents to be straightforward,

1158
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,780
直接说出我想要的
to ask simply for what I want,

1159
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,060
希望我能阐明我的立场
and expect that I may have to elucidate my position.

1160
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,540
我父母也鼓励我自己利用的想象力
Well, I was encouraged by mine to use my imagination,

1161
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,790
但我教会自己要避免被后果殃及
but I taught myself to avoid the consequences.

1162
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,550
只要十块钱  曼克
It's ten bucks, Mank.

1163
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,500
你随便打个赌都比这输得多
You piss that away between hopeless bets.

1164
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,950
我不敢想如果
I hate to think what L.B.

1165
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,140
LB知道你是唯一的反对者  他会怎么做
might do if he knew you were the only holdout.

1166
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,220
-我是  他不知道吗  -我们不会告诉他的
- I am, and he doesn't? - And we're not gonna tell him.

1167
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,030
-我可以放你一马  -这可是死罪
- I could let you go for this. - It is a hanging offense.

1168
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,270
我只要把这笔钱加到你的赌债上
I'll add the appropriate amount to your gambling debt

1169
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,340
就当我们没谈过这件事
and forget we ever had this conversation.

1170
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,450
你去做吧
You do that.

1171
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,260
那么全新的编剧工会
And the brand-spanking-new Writers Guild

1172
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,810
可能会对这件事非常感兴趣  更别提报纸了
might find it very interesting, not to mention the newspapers.

1173
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,030
我觉得工会应该没兴趣报道与赌博有关的事
I'm not sure the guild intends to cover games of chance.

1174
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,560
你也不会去找媒体
And you won't go to the press,

1175
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,190
因为在加州  媒体等同于赫斯特
because in California, that means Hearst.

1176
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,870
欧文  你是镇上最精明的高管
Irving, you are the shrewdest executive in this town.

1177
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,140
你为什么表现得像个愚蠢的政客走卒
Why are you acting like some dumb ward heeler?

1178
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:55,050
你不需要我的捐款  你不需要任何人的
You don't need my donation. You don't need anybody's.

1179
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,460
你在这里已经拥有一切了
You have everything it takes right here.

1180
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,340
什么意思
Meaning?

1181
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,050
意思就是你可以让这个世界
Meaning you can make the world

1182
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,830
笃定金刚有十层楼高
swear King Kong is ten stories tall

1183
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,450
玛丽·毕克馥40岁时还是处女
and Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.

1184
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:12,670
但你无法让饥饿的选民相信  一个叛徒社会主义者
Yet you can't convince starving voters that a turncoat socialist

1185
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,450
对加州所珍视的一切都是威胁吗
is a menace to everything Californians hold dear?

1186
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,090
你根本没努力
You're barely trying.

1187
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,030
数百万的加州人
Millions of Californians

1188
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,070
因高额税款而无家可归
are being taxed out of their homes,

1189
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,390
然而大萧条却物质过剩
yet the Depression is one of abundance.

1190
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:41,720
水果烂在地上  蔬菜被丢进海里
Fruit rots on the ground and vegetables are dumped into the ocean

1191
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,060
因为没有市场
because there are no markets for them.

1192
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,780
艾米·桑卜·麦弗逊说你是个无神论共产主义者  厄普顿

先生  耶稣的宗教
Too often, sir,

1194
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:52,370
常常被被统治阶级所利用
the religion of Jesus is used by the ruling classes

1195
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,610
让自己掌权  让穷人更穷
to keep themselves in power and the poor ever poorer.

1196
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,330
朋友们  这是一种罪孽和错误
And that, my friends, is a sin and an error.

1197
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,480
我同意托马斯·杰斐逊说的
And I say with Thomas Jefferson,

1198
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,730
"真理无需惧怕错误
"Truth has nothing to fear from error

1199
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,940
因为理性可以自由与之抗争"
where reason is left free to combat it."

1200
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,010
朋友们  我国的收入

依法执行或暴力革命

1203

我们没多少时间来做选择了
We haven't much longer to exercise our choice.

感谢各位的到来

跟我们说说好莱坞
Tell us about Hollywood!

1206
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,370
制片厂真像他们说的那样要搬去佛州吗
Are the studios moving to Florida like they've been saying?

1207
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,570
真是荒谬  先生
Absurd, sir.

1208

如果是真的  那为什么华纳兄弟又开始动工
If they were serious, why have the brothers Warner broken ground

1209
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,240
扩建一个900平方米的摄影棚呢
on an additional 100,000 square feet of sound stages?

1210
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,190
而米高梅目前与明星的合约是有史以来最多的
While MGM has the most contracts with stars in their history.

但我在13天内拿到了200多页
but I have over 200 pages in 13 days.

1217
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,010
我从没想过这有可能实现
I never would've thought it possible.

1218

-敬辅助设备  -辅助设备

据权威人士说

1221
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,750
这是他写过的最佳作品
it's the best thing he's ever done.

1222
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,760
作为一部电影  这简直是完美
As a moving picture, it's more than good.

1223
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,150
我甚至无法表达
I'm at a loss to even express

1224
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,350
财富和影响力能如何击垮一个人
how wealth and influence can crush a man.

1225
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,840

1226
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,500
我之前完全搞错了

1227
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,970
视角的转变是革命性的
The shifting point of view is revolutionary.

1228
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,980
我从没想过居然会这么在意雪橇
I never thought one could care so much about a sled.

1229
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,870
你这么说真是好心

1230
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:43,790
但是
But.

1231
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,480
又是"但是"
"But," again.

1232
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,160
一共327页  真是过于冗长的窘境
It's 327 pages. An embarrassment of riches.

1233
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:51,110
等狗脸兄弟来了以后
When the Dog-Faced Boy gets here,

1234
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,320
我们就要删减很多细节了

1237

以及应该有的结局
and a suggested destination.

1238
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,320
至于怎么拍  那就是他的工作了
Where he takes it, that's his job.

1239

我只来帮你争取报酬的
I was, uh, looking to get you paid.

我不清楚你知不知道
I don't know if you were aware or not.

1241
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,770
你把版权给了水星剧院

1242
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:24,550
你同意不署名

都说好了
It worked out.

1248
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:46,750
曼克  恕我冒昧  为什么写赫斯特
Mank, if I may be so bold, why Hearst?

1249
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,310
大家都知道  除了他自己的金发贝蒂娃娃

年轻人  我是个寡妇

-谁雇了你  -米高梅
- Who's hiring? - MGM.

1280

我不知道是谁想出来的
I don't know who thought of it,

1285
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,360
但这能让我们很多人避免流落街头

1286
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,770

He's hopeless confused with Sinclair Lewis.

1289
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,400
很多乡巴佬认为是他写了《孽海痴魂》
So many hicks think he wrote Elmer Gantry,

1290
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,230
这让他失去了尘暴区的选票
it's cost him the Dust Bowl vote.

1291
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:27,120
我跟

Poor sap. Not only has he got no money,

真是不懂政治  我不跟
Talk about political handicaps. I'm out.

《泰晤士报》说他会输20万票
Times says he'll lose by 200,000.

1296

1298
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,960

That's what he gets for surrounding himself with amateurs.

1299
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,750
他们不仅对集会收入场费
They not only charge admission to rallies,

1300
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,430
等那些白痴入场后他们还继续要捐款
they pass a plate once the suckers are inside.

He's the most famous schlub after FDR, Hitler,

1303
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:51,750

1304
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,200
这也算有点意义
That oughta count for something.

老莫德的电台节目一播出
Soon as old Maude's radio spots started running,

1307
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:01,120
赔率就从7比5变成1比2
the odds went from 7-5 for to 2-1 against.

1308
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,920
你们这些无能的政治势利小人能闭嘴好好玩吗
Could you effete political snobs please shut up and play?

1309
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,030
曼克  我能跟你谈谈吗

什么  现在吗  谢利
What, now, Shelly?

1313
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,640
最好是重要的事
It better be.

1314
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,030
这是我今天拿到的第一手好牌
That's the first good hand I've had all day.

1315
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,670
我不知道他还懂得分辨好牌
I didn't know he knew what a good hand looked like.

1316
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,330
我不跟

此次选举你支持谁
Would you mind telling us who you favor in this election?

1318

1319
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,450
主要原因是什么呢
Would you mind telling us your principal reason.

1320
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,970
我投梅里亚姆是因为我想要有份工作
Well, I want Merriam because I want a job.

1321
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,760
要是把资本全都赶出去
If you drive all the capital

1322
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,580
谁来给我们付工钱
out of the country, who's gonna pay us?

1323
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,340
所以你觉得梅里亚姆当选对我们是最安全的
So you think Merriam would be safest for all of us?

1324
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,530
绝对的
Absolutely.

1325
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,830
临阵换将殊为不智
It's no time to trade horses in the middle of a stream.

1326
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,190
巴特勒先生  这次选举您准备投票吗
Mr. Butler, are you going to vote in the coming election?

1327
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,500
-肯定要投  -您准备给谁投票呢
- I most certainly am. - Who would you wish to vote for?

1328
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,470
我肯定要投给辛克莱先生
I'm sure that I'm gonna vote for Mr. Sinclair.

1329
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,840
您投给辛克莱先生肯定有充分理由吧
You must have a good reason to vote for Mr Sinclare.

1330
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,790
辛克莱先生想法比较新颖  他有那个宏伟计划
Mr. Sinclair's got something new. He got that EPIC Plan.

1331
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,310
并且我感觉这次我们应该尝试一点新东西了
And I feel as though it's time we should try something new out again.

1332
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,090
我需要繁荣
I need prosperity.

1333
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,710
首先  我是个美国人
Well, first of all, I'm an American,

1334
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,450
我相信梅里亚姆先生
and I believe that Mr. Merriam

1335
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:13,380
会坚守这个国家在过去150年来
will support all the foundations and principles

1336
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:16,750
一直坚持的根基和原则
that this country has stood for in the past 150 years.

1337
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,790
我现在有份工作  我不想丢工作
I have a job now, and I wanna keep it.

1338
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,710
我妻子和我都喜欢加州  我们也想留下
My wife and I love California, and we'd like to stay.

1339
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,420
但万一我们得离开
But in case we should have to leave,

1340
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:26,760
我希望手里起码还能有点钱
I'd like to have at least a couple dollars.

1341
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,760
卡
Cut.

1342
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:36,300
哈蒙特里夫人  请告诉我们
Mrs. Hammontree, would you mind telling the

1343
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,360
你投给弗兰克·梅里亚姆的原因
folks why you're voting for Frank Merriam.

1344
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,930
我要投给弗兰克·梅里亚姆
Well, I'm voting for Frank merriam

1345
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,780
因为我想维护我们的生活方式
because I wanna keep our way of life.

1346
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:44,170
您认为民主党员就不会维护您的生活方式了吗
You don't believe a Democrat would protect your way of life?

1347
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,760
那家伙是个社会主义者
Why, that man's a socialist.

1348
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,310
我不太懂政治  但我很清楚
I don't know much about politics, but I do know this.

1349
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,910
如果厄普顿·辛克莱赢得了选举
If Upton Sinclair wins this election,

1350
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,400
加州的私有制度就要完蛋了
private ownership in California won't amount to a hill o' beans.

1351
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,470
我们的系统需要彻底的革新
Well, we need complete rejuvenation of our system,

1352
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,360
所以我投给厄普顿同志
so I vote for Comrade Upton.

1353
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,330
他的体系在俄国能行  在这里怎么就不行
His system work in Russia, why not here?

1354
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,100
卡  再来一次
Cut. Do it again.

1355
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:09,780
你怎么看
What'd you think?

1356
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:14,030
说实话  谢利  如果表演水平能再好点
Truthfully, Shelly, if the performances were any better,

1357
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:15,650
你就该感到羞愧了
you'd be ashamed of yourself.

1358
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,290
这些人只有一半是演员
Only half of 'em were actors.

1359
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,400
有那种第一手新闻的感觉  不是吗
It's got that raw newsreel feel, hasn't it?

1360
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,300
但这不是新闻  也不真实
But it isn't news and it isn't real.

1361
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,650
我不想争论伦理问题
I wasn't looking to have an ethical debate thing.

1362
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:29,220
-他们什么时候炮制出的这个  -制作部开了次会
- When did they cook this up? - At a meeting in production.

1363
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,020
他们当时在传阅一个
They were passing around a

1364
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:33,360
辛克莱写的传单  叫作"消除加州的贫困"
pamphlet Sinclair wrote called "Ending Poverty in California"

1365
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,330
"美国的失业者将会入侵黄金之州"
"America's unemployed will invade the Golden State."

1366
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,550
-梅耶兴高采烈地要用这个对付他  -我猜也是
- Mayer was practically giddy to use it against him. - Yeah, I bet he was.

1367
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,270
这足以让我相信  对无戒备心的公众而言
It's enough to persuade me that a writer is more of a menace

1368
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:46,940
编剧比党派文人要危险多了
to an unsuspecting public than a party hack.

1369
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:50,220
-曼克  -你还好吗
- Manky... - You okay?

1370
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,330
就是压力有点大
Just nerves.

1371
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,080
要是你这么烦恼  谢利  干嘛要参与呢
If it's bothering you, Shelly, why get involved?

1372
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,930
他们给了我执导的机会
They gave me a chance to direct.

1373
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,730
你不会真以为年龄足够投票的人会信这玩意吧
You don't think anyone old enough to vote is gonna buy this shit?

1374
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:10,330
只有那些相信金刚有十层楼高
Only the ones who believe King Kong is ten stories tall

1375
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,200
{\an8}禁止吸烟
违者将被处分

1376
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:13,380
或者玛丽·毕克馥40岁还是处女的人会相信
or Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.

1377
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,740
谢谢  塞德里克  这些就行
Thanks, Cedric. These are fine.

1378
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:35,330
我刚看完我们拍的辛克莱影片
I've just watched our Sinclair films.

1379
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:37,990
你怎么看
What did you think?

1380
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:42,050
我对谢利并无不敬之意  但是比《金刚》差远了
With all due respect to Shelly, King Kong they ain't.

1381
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,750
尽管流浪汉入侵的片段
Though I do think footage

1382
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:48,850
登在《洛杉矶时报》的头版
of invading hobos has a certain xenophobic power

1383
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,930
加上低劣广告牌标语
when front-paged in the times

1384
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,850
确实能煽动一些排外情绪
and backed by those tacky billboards.

1385
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,260
谢利获得执导的机会
Shelly got a chance to direct,

1386
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,960
我还免除了你一万二的赌债
and I canceled your $12,000 gambling debt.

1387
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,500
只花一分钟对缺乏创意的电影公司高层游说
I'd call that a fair return on a one-minute lecture

1388
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,650
就能有这样的回报很不错了
for uninspired studio chieftains.

1389
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:05,340
你的导演正备受良知谴责
Your director's been stricken with a bout of conscience.

1390
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,690
那他肯定会自己告诉我
I'm sure he'll tell me himself.

1391
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:12,030
别这样做  欧文
Don't do this, Irving.

1392
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,030
我年轻时
When I was just a boy

1393
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,350
在布朗克斯区发过社会主义传单
passing out socialist leaflets in the Bronx,

1394
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,620
两位坦慕尼打手给我展示了一下我的方式多么错误
a couple Tammany goons came to show me the error of my ways.

1395
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,490
其中一个踩碎了我的睾丸
And one of them crushed my testicles

1396
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:26,390
迫使我同意把我的传单都丢进伊斯特河
until I volunteered to distribute my wares into the East River.

1397
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:30,870
这就是政治  这不是我创造的  我也不会为此道歉
That's politics. I didn't invent it, I don't apologize for it.

1398
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:37,160
梅耶不会为这个付钱的
Mayer's not paying for this.

1399
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,690
他从来不付钱
He never pays for anything.

1400
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,140
威利
Willie?

1401
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:50,700
-玛丽安可能会有点兴趣  -你得动作快点
- Marion might be interested. - Well, you're gonna have to hurry.

1402
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,200
梅耶正在那边和她解除合同呢
Mayer's over there now giving her the company kiss-off.

1403
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,860
你没听说吗
Oh, haven't you heard?

1404
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:01,060
她要带着婴儿护栏去华纳兄弟了  不回来了
She's taking her playpen to Warner Bros. Permanently.

1405
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:03,400
华纳兄弟
Warner's?

1406
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:05,620
我可不会让她出演玛丽·安托瓦内特
I wouldn't let her do Marie Antoinette.

1407
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,550
高德温算是说对了一次
Goldwyn's right for once.

1408
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,070
"扮演那个角色的喜剧演员就是要发笑"
"A comedienne in that role is to laugh."

1409
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,890
而且她的片子十年来一分钱也没赚到
Besides, her pictures haven't made a dime in a decade.

1410
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:16,760
恭喜  欧文
Congratulations, Irving.

1411
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,320
我知道我的身份  曼克
I know what I am, Mank.

1412
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,150
我不把工作当成体验生活
When I come to work, I don't consider it slumming.

1413
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:24,750
我不用幽默来让自己显得超然物外
I don't use humor to keep myself above the fray.

1414
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,990
并且我会为我的信念奋战到底
And I go to the mat for what I believe in.

1415
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,260
我也没有时间搞别的
I haven't the time to do otherwise.

1416
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,160
但你  先生
But you, sir,

1417
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,340
像你这样的人
how formidable people like you

1418
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,950
如果努力的话其实可以大有作为
might be if they actually gave at the office.

1419
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,760
关上门
Close the door.

1420
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,840
这张拍得真漂亮
Oh, that's a beautiful shot right there.

1421
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,790
曼克  你还好吗
Mank! Are you okay?

1422
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,050
不好  差点跑死我  威利在哪
No, that almost killed me. Where's Willie?

1423
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,500
大概在开罗
Cairo, I think.

1424
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,850
-你能给他打电话吗  -我从不给他打电话  都是他打给我
- Can you phone him? - I don't phone him, he phones me.

1425
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:37,030
他什么时候回来
When's he due back?

1426
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,460
11月6日之后吧  下周我去欧洲找他
After November 6th. I'm joining him in Europe next week.

1427
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:45,730
玛丽安  我需要你帮个忙  就是跟威利开个小玩笑
Marion, I need a favor. It's just a little joke on Willie.

1428
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:46,700
当然  曼克  什么都行
Sure, Mank, anything.

1429
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,750
我希望你回去跟梅耶说
I want you to go back and tell Mayer

1430
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:54,050
什么辛克莱的虚假影片
Willie wants the phony Sinclair films pulled.

1431
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,950
哪一部辛克莱假影片
Which phony Sinclair films?

1432
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:01,160
没时间解释了  你就回去这么说
There isn't time to explain. I just need you to tell him that.

1433
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,460
我做不到  就算是玩笑也不行
Oh, I couldn't, not even as a joke.

1434
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:06,450
-为什么  -你知道我不撒谎的
- Why not? - You know I don't lie.

1435
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,450
所以他会相信你说的话
And that's why he'd believe you.

1436
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,100
玛丽安  拜托  你已经从修女子教会学校毕业了
Marion, please, you're not in convent school anymore.

1437
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:20,410
-抱歉  我知道这很蠢  但...  -但什么  为什么
- I'm sorry. I... I know it's silly, but... - But what? Why not?

1438
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:24,510
-你保证你不会笑  -我保证我不笑
- Promise you won't laugh. - I promise I won't laugh.

1439
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,740
-我的离开  -什么
- My exit. - What?

1440
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:31,250
我已经离开了
I already made my exit.

1441
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,220
-曼克  -怎么了
- Manky! - Whatie?

1442
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,200
-有只灰喉翔食雀  -恭喜  最佳品种
- It's an ash-throated flycatcher! - Congratulations! Best kind.

1443
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,020
我能说什么
What can I say?

1444
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,880
她是我姑妈
She's my aunt.

1445
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,790
这故事不是讲她的  是讲他
Oh, it's not about her, it's about him.

1446
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:19,650
-或者说  是他  但不是她  -不是吗
- Or rather, it's him, but it's not her. - It isn't?

1447
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,830
孤独的歌舞女郎  困在城堡里玩拼图游戏
The lonely showgirl, trapped in a castle, doing jigsaw puzzles.

1448
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:27,620
那更像是不认识她的人对她的想象
It's more, her as people who don't know her imagine her to be.

1449
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,660
我懂了
I see.

1450
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,580
是他们幻象的她  但是你认识的他
It's her as they imagine her, but it's him as you knew him.

1451
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,240
-该死  查理  -是你叫我来的
- Damn it, Charlie. - You asked me out here.

1452
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,540
我很荣幸能来读你的最新作品
I was honored to come and read your latest.

1453
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:41,420
-这是测试吗  -测试  测什么
- Is this a test? - A test? Of what?

1454
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,690
-友谊  忠诚  -别闹了
- Friendship? Loyalty? - Oh, come now.

1455
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:47,130
还是说只是你想逃避责任
Or just your way of avoiding responsibility?

1456
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,090
你什么意思
What do you mean?

1457
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,710
你这样背叛我们  还指望我原谅你吗
Are you hoping I might absolve you of such a personal betrayal?

1458
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,850
我不会的
I won't give you that.

1459
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,180
你有什么要说吗
Are you going to say anything?

1460
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,490
-我得想想  -为什么
- I have to think about it. - Why?

1461
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:12,430
因为我还不能确定她会怎么反应
'Cause I haven't made up my mind how she might react.

1462
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,170
你的直觉呢
What does instinct tell you?

1463
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,790
这是一剂强效药
It's mighty strong medicine

1464
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:18,420
可以治疗一辈子都天真乐观自我沉醉的人
for a lifetime of starry-eyed self-absorption.

1465
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:21,390
这种办法可能是饮鸩止渴
It's one of those cures that could be worse than the disease.

1466
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,960
但你应该比任何人都清楚
But you, of all people, should know about that.

1467
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:32,840
他拿走了剧本吗
He took the script?

1468
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,030
他会给她看吗
Will he show it to her?

1469
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,160
我不知道
I don't know.

1470
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,550
你希望他给她看吗
Do you want him to?

1471
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:47,160
我不知道
I don't know.

辛克莱已经过时了

从来没有胜算
Never stood a chance.

1475

快做决定吧
Make up your mind.

1476
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:31,610
我们是回家舔舐伤口  还是既来之则安之
Are we home licking our wounds or here making the best of it?

1477
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,750
既来之则安之
We're making the best of it.

Oh, terribly sorry. Table one. Right this way.

1484

I would've imagined you in pajamas by now.

1491

曼克  我们在卡姆登看的是同一位牙医
Mank, turns out we have the same dentist on Camden.

莎拉  我们得腾一天去购物  叙叙旧
Sara, we have to plan a day of shopping and catch up.

1493

赫尔曼  我遇见你弟弟了  你们兄弟太像了
Herman, I met your brother. He's a chip off the old block.

这对我的意义简直难以言表  你能来我很感动
I can't tell you how much it means. I'm touched you'd come.

1497
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:45,050
谢谢
Thank you.

1498
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:49,730

- What a great night. Great result. - I'll drink to that.

1502
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:46,080
你看  只要以感性的方式告诉人们所需的信息
You see, if you just give people what they need to know

1503
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:50,160
就可以指望他们做出正确的事
in an emotional way, you can expect they'll do the right thing.

1504
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,550
我想你是说
I think what you mean,

1505
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:54,290
"一个谎言只要说得够响亮够久
"If you keep telling people something untrue,

1506
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,860
人们就会相信它"
loud and long enough, they're apt to believe it."

1507
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,840
他没这么说
That's not what he was saying.

1508
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,910
怎么回事  怎么开始引用戈培尔的话了
What's going on here? Are we quoting Goebbels?

1509
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:03,890
-我愿意和LB辩论这个  -我也愿意看
- I'd like to debate that with L.B. - I'd like to see that.

1510

曼克  再喝一杯吧
Mank. Have another.

1511

It's early. Every vote counts.

1512
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:11,530
也许明智的加州人下班比较晚
Maybe the informed of California were late leaving work.

1513

What are you two talking about?

这样如何
I tell you what, how about...

1517
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:23,210
输了翻倍  赢了一笔勾销
Double or nothin'?

1518
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:24,910
-他说什么呢  -赫尔曼
- What's he saying? - Herman.

1519
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,410
你真的什么都能拿来赌
You really will bet on anything.

1520
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:30,800
留着你的钱吧
Keep your money.

1521
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,830
我能教训那个乌托邦龟孙就很开心了
I'm happy enough just to nail that utopian son of a bitch to the wall.

1522
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:38,220
我告诉你了  作为感谢你赌债已经免除了
I told you. Your obligation was canceled out of gratitude.

1523
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:39,410
等等  什么
Wait a minute. What?

1524
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,660
他都不欠我们了
He wants to wager double

1525
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,440
还要下双倍赌注
or nothin' on a debt he doesn't even owe us?

1526
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,400
-曼克  -这是原则问题  LB你不懂
- Mank. - It's a matter of principle, L.B. You wouldn't understand.

1527
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:54,810
我懂得很  我愿意赌
I understand plenty. I'll take that bet.

1528
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:58,650
好  曼克  我们赌  你输了赔两万四  赢了不赢钱
Okay, Mank, you're on. Twenty-four grand or nothing.

I needed some air.

豪斯曼要回来了吗  没想到我会想念他
Is Houseman coming back? I never thought I'd miss him.

1576
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,100
他和那位天才正在删减第一稿
He and the wunderkind are cutting the first draft.

1577
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,080
这是创造性的活体解剖

1578
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,930
重要器官暴露出来后什么也没发现
Vital organs are exposed, nothing is learned,

1579
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:22,140
病人就死在手术台上

1580
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:29,730
谁来了
What have we here?

1581
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:36,660
是只趾高气昂  竖着红色尖尾巴的喜鹊
Why, it's a puffed-up, sharp-tailed, red-ruffled magpie.

1582
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,990
什么
A whatie?

1583
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,300
你觉得莫哈韦沙漠怎么样

1584
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,490
这是上帝对酒鬼和堕落者最好的安排
God's answer for drunks and reprobates.

1585
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,420

1586
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,330
-那你进展如何  -没用  干杯

1587
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:10,470
敬生活

1588
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:18,960
你为什么这么做  赫尔曼
Why are you doing this, Herm?

1589
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:21,850
-为了后人  -后人  才怪
- Posterity. - Posterity, my ass.

1590
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:24,240
-源自拉丁语  -别班门弄斧
- From the original Latin. - Don't patronize me.

1591
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,930
我拉丁语成绩比你好
My Latin grades were better than yours.

1592
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:28,030
喝吧  因为我们终将一死
Bibamus, moriendum est.

1593
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,830
我读了你的小剧本
I read your little script.

1594
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,930
消息传得真快
News travels fast.

1595
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,260
即使没有标题
Even without the title page,

1596
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:42,180
就算不是大侦探也知道这是谁写的
you don't need to be Philip Marlowe to know who wrote it.

1597
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:44,270
说说吧
Have at it.

1598
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,890
非常...
It's very...

1599
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:48,930
复杂
Complicated.

1600
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,060
谢谢你跑一趟
Well, thanks for coming out.

1601
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:53,920
赫尔曼  听我一句
Herman, this is me.

1602
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,380
你跟威利斗  你就完蛋了
You pick a fight with Willie, you are finished.

1603
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:59,660
梅耶救不了你  谁都救不了你
Mayer can't save you. Nobody can.

1604
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:01,570
尤其是纽约来的那个天才小子
Especially the boy genius from New York.

1605
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,380
你太政治化了  乔
You're far too political, Joe.

1606
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:06,100
自我保护不是政治
Self-preservation is not politics.

1607
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,030
他  我理解
Him, I get.

1608
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:10,270
但玛丽安又做了什么要受这样的惩罚
But what did Marion ever do to deserve this?

1609
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:12,060
跟她无关
It's not her!

1610
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:17,790
你比谁都清楚  不是所有角色都是主角
You know better than anyone, not all characters are headliners.

1611
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:18,820
有些人是配角
Some are secondary.

1612
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:23,130
所以我才来这里  代表配角们
Well, that's why I'm here. On behalf of the secondary characters.

1613
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,310
我觉得应该告诉你  城里有流言说
I thought you'd wanna know there's a rumor in town

1614
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,260
你针对赫斯特
you're out to get Hearst

1615
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:30,710
是因为LB的公司把你解雇了
because they dropped you from L.B.'s payroll,

1616
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,510
因为他们不要你了
that they didn't want you around anymore.

1617
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:34,840
别轻信街头的谣传
Don't believe everything you hear at Schwab's.

1618
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,140
是你把自己变成了宫廷小丑
Hey, you made yourself court jester.

1619
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:42,290
总得有人说出来
Someone had to say it.

1620
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,170
人们猜玫瑰花蕾是
People are speculating Rosebud is

1621
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:56,040
WR对玛丽安阴部的昵称
W.R.'s pet name for Marion's genitalia.

1622
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,880
我知道你不会低俗至此
Now, I know you'd never stoop to that.

1623
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,920
那是因为我还没听说这事
Only because I hadn't heard.

1624
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:18,450
查理告诉我你要接手萨尔伯格职位
Charlie tells me you're up for Thalberg's old job.

1625
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:20,990
-没戏了  -是我的缘故吗
- Not anymore. - Did I bollix that?

1626
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:24,060
别自作多情了  赫尔曼  我自己的缘故
Don't flatter yourself, Herman. I did it all alone.

1627
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,390
这可以头一回
Now, there's a first.

1628
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:29,320
我在宫廷上露出了马脚  这不完全是比喻
I exposed myself, not entirely metaphorically, in court.

1629
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,490
说说吧
Do tell.

1630
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,080
有人抱怨说
Somebody was bitching about

1631
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,670
茂文·勒鲁瓦在《绿野仙踪》上超支了
Mervyn Leroy running over budget on Wizard of Oz.

1632
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:35,490
又是该死的电影
Goddamn movie again.

1633
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:37,520
我说了句"Le Roy取悦自己"
I said, "Le Roy s'amuse."

1634
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,530
然后我被迫花了20分钟
I was then forced to spend the next 20 minutes

1635
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:41,050
来解释"Le Roy"
having to explain that "Le Roy"

1636
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,920
是法语的"Le roi"  是国王的意思
is "Le roi" in French and means "The king."

1637
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:46,110
或者更确切地说  就是弗朗索瓦一世
Or to be specific, François I,

1638
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:48,310
以及他通过哄骗宫廷里的所有女士
and his royal habit of s'amus-ing himself

1639
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,790
来取悦自己的皇家习惯
by diddling all the ladies of his court.

1640
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,210
波普说得对  你应该当教授
You know, Pop was right. You should've been a professor.

1641
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,240
没人懂我他妈在说什么
Nobody knew what the fuck I was talking about.

1642
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:06,350
他们说我被淘汰是因为我不善于团队合作
They say I was passed over because I'm not a team player.

1643
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,030
但我知道
But I know better.

1644
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:11,030
是那该死的法语双关害了我
It was the goddamn French pun that did me in.

1645
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:19,280
我江郎才尽了  乔
I'm washed up, Joe.

1646
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:24,220
已经好几年了
Have been for years.

1647
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:31,750
这是你写得最好的一部作品
It's the best thing you've ever written.

1648
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,700
那可是稀有鸟类
A rare bird, that.

1649
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:54,310
曼凯维奇品种
A Mankiewicz.

1650
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:08,830
{\an7}{\pos(40.167,136.158)}外景  米高梅电影公司  选举前夜  1934年  闪回

1651
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:20,960
-这么做没用  -怎么做
- You can't do it that way. - Do what?

1652
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,760
酗酒自杀  我试过了  要很多年才能死
Kill yourself. I've tried. It takes years.

1653
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:28,740
我厌倦了插入和衔接镜头
I was tired of doing inserts and pick-up shots.

1654
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,150
你不是第一个为了执导
You're not the first person to trade integrity

1655
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:33,310
而出卖诚信的人
for a chance in the big chair.

1656
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:36,940
萨尔伯格说那是你出的主意
Thalberg said this was your idea.

1657
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,650
有时候我的玩笑话太睿智了
Sometimes my asides are too clever by half.

1658
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,820
回家找菲去
Go home to Fay.

1659
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:48,200
-夏娃  -夏娃  抱歉
- Eve. - Eve. Sorry.

1660
01:36:50,410 --> 01:36:54,170
看我们做了什么  没有后悔药
Look at what we did. We can't un-ring this bell.

1661
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,220
我们得保持警惕
We have to be vigilant.

1662
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:57,910
警惕什么
In regards to?

1663
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:59,890
黑暗中的观众
People sitting in the dark,

1664
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:02,460
把他们的怀疑丢在门外
willingly checking their disbelief at the door.

1665
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,890
我们责任重大
We have a huge responsibility.

1666
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:08,580
我病了
I got it.

1667
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:10,430
什么病
Got what?

1668
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,230
帕金森
Parkinson's.

1669
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:21,340
不  谢利
No, Shelly.

1670
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,600
我很难过
I'm so sorry.

1671
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:31,310
刚开始是颤抖
First, you get the tremors,

1672
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,770
然后肌肉不听使唤
and your muscles begin to fail.

1673
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:38,380
很快  人就站不起来了
Pretty soon, you can't get out of a chair.

1674
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,610
然后微笑  说话
Then smiling, speaking,

1675
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,490
统统做不了
everything goes.

1676
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,780
一直到...
And it keeps going till...

1677
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,360
你还可以制片
You could always produce.

1678
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,410
把枪给我  谢利
Give me the gun, Shelly.

1679
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:24,570
拿去  曼克
Take 'em, Mank.

1680
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:29,510
回家吧  我没事的
Go on home. I'll be fine.

1681
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:16,180
他跟你回来了吗
Is he with you?

1682
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,270
他不肯回来
He... He wouldn't come.

1683
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:22,060
拜托告诉我你把枪拿回来了
Please tell me you got the gun.

1684
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,190
天啊

01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:34,670
-怎么了  -他拿走了一整盒子弹
- What? - He had a whole box.

1686
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,360
曼克
Mank.

1687
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:53,730
你又有客人来了
You have another visitor.

1688
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:56,410
什么
What?

1689
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:21,400
快点喝  天这么热  很快就蒸发到只剩糖了
Drink it fast. In this heat, it'll flash to sugar.

1690
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,040
为什么请我美酒佳肴  玛丽安
Why the wine and dine, Marion?

1691
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,260
一个红脸一个白脸吗
Good cop, bad cop?

1692
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:36,370
-你什么意思  曼克  -先是乔然后是你
- How do you mean, Mank? - First Joe, now you.

1693
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,550
有什么想法你不妨直说
Can't you just tell me what's on your mind?

1694
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,340
我读了你的剧本
Well, I read the script.

1695
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,410
人人都读过
Who hasn't?

1696
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:50,440
非常了不起  曼克  很有你的风格
It's very grand, Mank, in its own way, and very much you.

1697
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:53,080
换作十年前  我都想演我自己
I would've loved to play me ten years ago.

1698
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,260
那角色根本就不是你
It was never meant to be you.

1699
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,070
我自己无所谓  曼克  真的  我不在乎
For myself, I don't care, Mank. Really, I don't.

1700
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:03,170
但我求你  不要在老爹失利时对他落井下石
But I beg you, don't kick Pops when he's down.

1701
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:05,040
威利  失利
Willie, down?

1702
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:09,800
我没跟任何人说过
I haven't told a soul this,

1703
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:14,260
但是为了挽救圣西蒙  我不得不借给他一百万美元
but I had to loan him a million dollars just to save San Simeon.

1704
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:16,030
你把你的珠宝当了
You hocked your jewels?

1705
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:18,200
当然没有  就是些房产
Of course not. Just some real estate.

1706
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,990
反正大多数也是他买给我的
He bought me most of it anyway.

1707
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,380
威利让你来的
Willie sent you.

1708

没这个必要
Didn't have to.

1709
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,050
你觉得意外吗
That surprises you?

1710
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,510
你是我认识的最具观察力的人
You're the most observant man I know.

1711
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:34,980
-你值得更好的  -谢谢你这么说
- Then you deserve better. - That's very sweet.

我一直追求更好的
I always wanted better.

1713

露丝妈妈也是
Mama Rose too.

1714

她确保女儿们学会唱歌跳舞
She made sure her daughters learned to sing and dance.

1715
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,280
我们从没打算窝在布鲁克林
We were never gonna end up in Brooklyn.

1716
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:50,720
我演《停！看！听》的时候才16岁
I was only 16 when I was cast in Stop! Look! Listen!

1717
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,770

Willie came to the show. Same seat every night.

1719
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,350
其他的姑娘们都叫我小心
And all the other girls said to watch out.

1720
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:00,530
说他对我来说太老了  太热情了
He was too old for me and too interested.

1721
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:03,690
少来  他又不是唯一的崇拜者
Come, now, he wasn't your only admirer.

1722
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:08,320
你剧本里写得很对...
The thing you got so right in your script...

1723
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:11,850
他小时候是多么孤独啊
was how lonely he'd been as a boy.

1724
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:15,860
我妈妈听说

他是美国最有钱的人后

她说  "把腿再抬高点"
she said, "Kick a little higher."

1727

他对我一直非常好
He has always been so kind to me.

1728
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:30,350
我爱这个老家伙  曼克
I love the old guy, Mank.

1729
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:36,350
也许以前我靠他养活的时候并不爱他
Maybe I didn't always, back when he was my social security.

1730
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:39,560
可是现在  我们在一起  有些事
But now, there are things about us together...

没人能够...
That no one could possibly...

1732
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:47,440
我有没有说动你
Am I persuading you at all?

1733
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:54,330
我希望  如果这部电影能拍出来
I hope, if this gets made,

1734
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:57,080
你会原谅我
you'll forgive me.

1735

我也希望  如果这部电影没拍出来
And I hope, if it doesn't,

It is not for us to say why he was taken from us so unexpectedly.

You gave me the same invitation after Shelly's funeral.

当然还需要修改
It'll need work, of course.

1777
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:05,340
但一起解决就没有问题
But there are no problems that can't be solved together.

我很高兴知道这些

Guess who phoned with an offer to buy out RKO's investment

1794
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:42,060
并且彻底终止制作这部电影
and shelve the picture permanently?

1795

-不是赫斯特吧  -曼克  我很惊讶

Mayer. What did RKO say?

01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:51,730
你的女主角演得怎么样
How's the performance of your leading lady?

1842
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:53,600
这部电影就靠她了
The picture depends upon her.

1843
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:56,480
诺玛全心全意地投入
Norma put her heart and soul into it.

1844
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,770
我应该坚持让她好好休息的
I should've insisted she take some time.

1845
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:00,730
那样的打击很难承受
It's a lot to deal with, a loss like that.

1846
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:02,730
要是让玛丽安演  就能演出特色
Marion would've made it her own.

1847
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:05,770
要是让玛丽安演  就能演得完美
Marion would've been perfection.

1848
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,020
玛丽安·安托瓦内特
Marion Antoinette.

1849
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:08,980
但那是欧文的电影
But it was Irving's picture.

1850
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:10,190
木偶玛丽安
Marionette.

1851
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:14,860
我没兴趣教育我们的观众
I'm not interested in educating our customers.

1852
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:17,940
你想传达信息  去找西联电报
You want to send a message? Call Western Union.

1853
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,020
所谓的文艺电影
Literary pictures.

1854
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,650
"让他们吃蛋糕吧"
"Let them get cake."

1855
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:24,650
谁要看那种电影
Who needs to see that?

1856
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,060
乔安娜  过来
Joanna, come along.

1857
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,940
我带你看看之前说的马
I'll show you those horses we talked about.

1858
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:41,690
她很漂亮
She's very pretty.

1859
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:46,320
而且很聪明  脾气倔  还是英国人
Also, very bright, bullheaded, and British.

1860
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:50,560
你也是来碰运气的吗  施努兹
Are you here to try your luck, too, Schnutz?

1861
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:51,770
什么运气
At what?

1862
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:54,480
改变我的想法
Changing my mind.

1863
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:57,770
我从来没成功过  赫尔曼
I never had much success with that, Herman.

1864
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:59,850
最终你都会做自己要做的事
In the end, you'll do what you need to.

1865
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:01,060
查理来过
Charlie's been here,

1866
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,900
乔来过  玛丽安来过
Joe's been, Marion's been.

1867
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,980
由于各种原因
For one reason or another,

1868
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:05,940
他们都想让我放弃
all of them want me to walk away.

1869
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:08,770
你想听听我的决定吗
You care to hear what I've decided?

1870
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,520
不太想听
Not really.

1871
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:14,270
在20年的美满婚姻后
After 20 years of connubial bliss,

1872
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:17,230
盲目忠诚会有点令人窒息
blind loyalty can get a little suffocating.

1873
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:18,320
好吧
Okay.

1874
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:20,610
听好了
Here goes.

1875
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,120
天知道我练习了多少遍
God knows I've rehearsed it enough.

1876
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:26,650
我按照犹太习俗养育孩子们  几乎全靠我自己
I've raised your kids kosher and all but by myself.

1877
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:28,730
我忍受你自杀式的酗酒
I've put up with your suicidal drinking,

1878
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:31,940
你强迫症般的赌博  你愚蠢的柏拉图式出轨
your compulsive gambling, your silly platonic affairs.

1879
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,940
你欠我的  赫尔曼
You owe me, Herman.

1880
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:36,810
乔说他不能保证
So Joe says he can't promise,

1881
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,690
但他觉得如果你和梅耶和好
but he thinks if you make nice with Mayer,

1882
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:40,520
你就可以回去工作
you can have your old job back.

1883
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,060
你是想让我这么说吗
Is that what you want me to say?

1884
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:43,560
我知道你会怎么回答
I know what your answer'll be,

1885
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:48,190
所以不要让我给你可怜的莎拉的批准
so don't ask me to give you Poor Sara's seal of approval.

1886
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:51,440
你为什么要忍受我  施努兹
Why do you put up with me, Schnutz?

1887
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:55,020
是我电影明星般的长相  还是我外交官般的魅力
My movie star looks or my diplomat's charm?

1888
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,400
我觉得是因为嫁给你  赫尔曼
I suppose because being married to you, Herman,

1889
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,820
我从来不会无聊
I'm never bored.

1890
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:03,350
的确筋疲力尽  经常很愤怒
Exhausted, yes. Exasperated, usually.

1891
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,400
但既然付出了这么多
But having devoted so much,

1892
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:08,400
我要坚持到最看看看结局
I have to stick around to see how it all turns out.

1893
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,190
无论你怎么决定
And whatever you decide,

1894
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:19,980
请为最关心你的人考虑考虑
please be mindful of those who care about you most.

1895
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:25,190
我去骑马了
I'm going riding.

1896
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,360
好多年没见过马了
Haven't seen a horse's face in years.

1897
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:32,520
最后一点  赫尔曼
And one last thing, Herman.

1898
01:51:33,810 --> 01:51:37,070
我不想再有人叫我"可怜的莎拉"了
I don't want nobody calling me Poor Sara no more.

1899
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:53,440
我有个电影的好点子  路易
I've got a great idea for a picture, Louis.

1900
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:58,110
一部我知道你肯定喜欢的电影
A picture I just know you're gonna love.

1901
01:51:58,610 --> 01:52:03,270
现代版的《堂吉诃德》
It's a modern-day version of Quixote.

1902
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:09,100
我知道你们都不读书
Now, I know none of you read,

1903
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:11,020
但你们知道是个什么故事
but you know what it's about.

1904
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:15,730
一个会攻击风车的受骗老贵族
A deluded old nobleman who tilts at windmills.

1905
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:19,860
我们该如何改编这个故事
So how might we update this story?

1906
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:20,990
需不需要我...
Do you want me to get...

1907
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:24,730
-不用  -把我们的堂吉诃德
- No, no. - How about we make our Quixote...

1908
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,730
变成新闻记者如何
A newspaperman?

1909
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:31,400
还有谁会以攻击风车为生
Who else could make a living tilting at windmills?

1910
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,070
但那不够
But that's not enough.

1911
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:36,230
不  他要的不仅是读者
No, he wants more than readership.

1912
01:52:36,230 --> 01:52:39,400
他要的不仅是吹捧
He wants more than adulation.

1913
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,980
他想要爱
He wants love.

1914
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:44,690
所以他去竞选公职
So, he runs for public office,

1915
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:47,440
因为他非常有钱  他赢了
and because he's notably rich, he wins.

1916
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:50,310
不  等一下
No, wait, wait a minute.

1917
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,190
光是非常有钱有权并不能吸引观众
Notably rich and powerful can't win over an audience

1918
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:55,270
除非他在电影的结尾
unless notably rich and powerful

1919
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:58,300
意识到了自己错在哪里
sees the error of his ways in the final reel.

1920
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,600
他非常有钱有权
Notably rich and powerful

1921
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:02,900
而且不找任何借口
and making no goddamn excuses

1922
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:05,850
因为这才是现实中令人敬佩的
for it is only admirable in real life.

1923
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:07,570
路易  我说得对吗
Isn't that right, Louis?

1924
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,120
那我们怎么办
So what do we do?

1925
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:15,730
有人知道吗
Anybody?

1926
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,020
我们给他理想
We give him ideals.

1927
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:23,730
任何穷困潦倒
Ideals that any dirt-poor,

1928
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:27,150
受大萧条打击的观众都能认同的理想
depression-weary audience can identify with.

1929
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:29,770
我们的堂吉诃德反对骗人的信托
Our Quixote is against crooked trusts.

1930
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:31,560
他支持工作日工作八小时
He's for the eight-hour workday,

1931
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,690
公平的所得税  更好的学校
fair income tax, better schools.

1932
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:37,570
他甚至支持铁路公有化
Why, he's even for government ownership of railroads.

1933
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,190
知道我们管这种人叫什么吗
You know what we call those people?

1934
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:41,730
-共产党  -无政府主义者
- Communists? - Anarchists?

1935
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:46,150
不  我们的堂吉诃德是精壮的爆料者
No, our Quixote, he's a two-fisted muckraker.

1936
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:50,400
事实上  有人预言他总有一天会
In fact, someone predicts that he will one day

1937
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:54,070
当选总统  带来一场
win the presidency and bring about, get this...

1938
01:53:58,730 --> 01:54:01,600
社会主义革命
a socialist revolution.

1939
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:04,520
-屁话连篇  -是吗
- What a bunch of bullshit! - Is it?

1940
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:07,110
告诉他
Tell him.

1941
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:09,230
告诉他
Tell him.

1942
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:15,230
厄普顿·辛克莱用了同样的词
Upton Sinclair used exactly those words

1943
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:17,810
来形容年轻的威廉·鲁道夫·赫斯特
to describe a young William Randolph Hearst.

1944
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:21,190
-你这可悲的混蛋  -你好啊
- You miserable bastard! - How do you do?

1945
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:27,190
我们的堂·吉诃德  他热切期求
Our Quixote, he hungers, he thirsts,

1946
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:30,090
他渴望选民们喜爱他
he lusts for voters to love him.

1947
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:32,730
喜爱到选他成为总统
Love him enough to make him president.

1948
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:35,350
但选民们不愿意  他们没有选他做总统
But they won't, and they don't.

1949
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,440
你们认为为何会如此呢
How do you suppose that could happen?

1950
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,350
是否因为在选民的内心
Could it be because, in their hearts,

1951
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:43,310
深知他其实把权力看得比人民更重要
they know that he values power over people?

1952
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:46,020
他在国会中毫无建树
Disillusioned in Congress,

1953
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:50,690
两届任期中他一项法案都未能著成
he authors not one single piece of legislation in two terms.

1954
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:52,230
太难以置信了
Can you believe that?

1955
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:54,070
这剧本可得好好写
That'll take some writing.

1956
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,770
他拿到了竞选总统的提名
Placed in nomination for president,

1957
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:00,600
但这对于幕后的政客来说过于激进了
but it's too radical for the boys in the back.

1958
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,110
他完全没有胜算
His bid goes nowhere,

1959
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:04,770
但我们并非无所作为
but we're doing something.

1960
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:08,070
我们为他博取了同情分
We're building sympathy.

1961
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:12,310
失败后  他逃往安乐乡
Rejected, he flees to lotusland,

1962
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,940
在那里  他忠诚的侍从桑丘
where his faithful troll, Sancho,

1963
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:18,610
为他准备了一个虚无的王国...
has prepared a mythical kingdom for...

1964
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,020
等一下
Wait a minute.

1965
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,560
我忘了还有恋爱对象
I forgot the love interest.

1966
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:26,980
她名叫
Her name...

1967
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:29,690
杜尔西内娅
Dulcinea.

1968
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:33,310
风趣又爱好冒险  大智若愚
Funny, adventurous, smarter than she acts.

1969
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:34,230
她...
She's a...

1970
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:36,360
她是位歌舞女郎
She's a showgirl,

1971
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:38,350
配不上他的社会地位
beneath his social stratum,

1972
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,690
不过无关紧要
but that's okay,

1973
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:43,100
因为众所周知
because true love on the big screens,

1974
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:45,770
在大银幕上  爱是盲目的
we all know, is blind.

1975
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,520
她呢
And she...

1976
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:51,020
她也爱着他
Yeah, she loves him too.

1977
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:56,310
所以他带着她一同去往虚无的王国
So he takes her away to his mythical kingdom.

1978
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:58,150
请给我拿杯苏打水
Can I get a bicarb?

1979
01:55:59,150 --> 01:56:02,650
接下来涅墨西斯出场了
Now, along comes Nemesis.

1980
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:06,020
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}涅墨西斯为希腊神话中的复仇女神

1981
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:06,020
在希腊语中就是坏人的意思
That's Greek for any guy in a black hat.

1982
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:08,310
涅墨西斯竞选州长
Nemesis runs for governor

1983
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:11,520
轻而易举地获胜当选
and he's a shoo-in to win.

1984
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,570
为什么呢
Why?

1985
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:18,150
因为他与我们曾经的堂·吉诃德如出一辙
Because he's exactly what our Don used to be.

1986
01:56:18,230 --> 01:56:20,900
是个理想主义者  你们明白了吗
An idealist, you get it?

1987
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:22,900
不仅如此
And not only that,

1988
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:26,900
涅墨西斯也正是那位曾经预言
Nemesis is the same guy who once predicted

1989
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:31,900
堂·吉诃德会发动社会主义革命的人
our Quixote would one day preside over a socialist revolution.

1990
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:37,900
堂·吉诃德看着镜子中年轻的自己
Our Quixote looks into the mirror of his youth

1991
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:41,480
决定打碎玻璃
and decides to break this glass,

1992
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:45,060
那镜子提醒了他曾经是谁  让他发狂
a maddening reminder of who he once was.

1993
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:49,190
在他的忠仆桑丘的帮助下
Assisted by his faithful Sancho,

1994
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:53,730
堂·吉诃德使用了一切他所知的黑魔法
and armed with all the black magic at his command,

1995
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:56,310
打碎了镜子
he does just this.

1996
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:58,900
镜子碎掉了
Destroying in the process

1997
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,570
摧毁的不是一个人
not one man...

1998
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:02,810
而是两个人
but two.

1999
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:07,150
你觉得如何  路易
Well, what do you think, Louis?

2000
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,320
你觉得能上映吗
You think it'll play?

2001
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:24,770
别担心  大伙
Don't worry, folks.

2002
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:28,440
只是白葡萄酒和鱼一起吐了出来
The white wine came up with the fish.

2003
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:34,570
你他妈以为自己是谁  曼凯维奇
Who the fuck do you think you are, Mankiewicz?

2004
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:38,400
你不过是个宫廷小丑
You're nothin' but a court jester.

2005
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:41,110
让我给你透露个小秘密
And let me let you in on a little secret.

2006
01:57:41,110 --> 01:57:44,510
你知道你一半的薪水是谁付的吗
Do you have any idea who pays half your salary?

2007
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,850
你一半的薪水都是他付的
He pays half your fucking salary.

2008
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:49,190
是他  你个忘恩负义的东西
Him, you fucking ingrate.

2009
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:51,020
你不知道吧
You didn't know that, did ya?

2010
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:52,400
你想知道为什么吗
You wanna know why?

2011
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:54,650
因为他喜欢你说话的方式
Because he likes the way you talk.

2012
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:58,190
并不是你写作的方式  而是你说话的方式
Not the way you write, the way you talk.

2013
01:57:58,610 --> 01:58:01,070
你傻眼了吧
Don't that chap your ass?

2014
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:25,820
-请跟我来  -这地方很别致
- Please, follow me. - It's very quaint.

2015
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:35,310
该起床了  兄弟
Rise and shine, hombre.

2016
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,020
即将开始OK牧场大决战
Shoot-out at the O.K. Corral.

2017
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,020
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}1881年发生于亚利桑那州
警察和非法牛仔之间的一场枪战决斗

2018
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,980
在我们开始之前
Before we buckle down,

2019
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:43,190
我听说你有话不吐不快
I gather you have something to get off your chest?

2020
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:45,150
我确实有话要说
As a matter of fact, I do.

2021
01:58:45,150 --> 01:58:47,270
坦白说  我想是我的言辞让你不快了
Frankly, I think what I said upset you.

2022
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:48,940
我知道你的健康状况不好
I know your health's not what it might be.

2023
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:50,520
你的健康是最重要的
I understand that comes first.

2024
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,560
-是吗  -与制片厂的不和  还有官司
- Really? - This studio fuss, this lawsuit.

2025
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:55,690
天知道今后还有多大的压力
God only knows what pressure's yet to come.

2026
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:58,190
到了你这个年纪  想退休是非常合理的
At your age, you'd be justified in wanting out.

2027
01:58:58,190 --> 01:59:00,600
我才43岁  不过多谢体恤
I'm 43, but that's very understanding.

2028
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:02,560
梅耶的收购被否决了
Mayer's buyout was rejected.

2029
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,310
所以乱局才刚刚开始
So, the fat's only starting to hit the fire.

2030
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:07,270
我和雷电华谈过了
Now, I talked to RKO,

2031
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:09,020
我来告诉你他们打算怎么做
and I'll tell you what they're ready to do.

2032
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:12,150
鉴于你目前为止所完成的出色的工作
In recognition of the outstanding work you've done so far,

2033
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:14,270
他们不会要求你修改剧本
they're prepared to relieve you of the rewrite

2034
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:16,230
但仍然会付你全部酬劳
and still honor your full pay,

2035
01:59:16,770 --> 01:59:19,900
外加一万美元
plus $10,000.

2036
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:21,280
怎么样
How's that?

2037
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,810
这非常慷慨了
That's more than generous.

2038
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:28,150
但我不打算放弃
But I don't intend to walk.

2039
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,650
好的
All right.

2040
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:35,060
那你还有什么想法
What's bothering you, then?

2041
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:37,940
你不会喜欢我的想法  奥森
You're not going to like this, Orson.

2042
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:43,730
我要署名
I want credit.

2043
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:46,610
你说什么
Come again?

2044
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:50,320
这是我写过的最好的剧本
It's the best thing I've ever written.

2045
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,350
杰克  给我拿点古巴雪茄来
Jack, get me some Cuban cigars.

2046
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,520
-回维克多维尔拿吗  -尽量办  杰克
- In Victorville? - Do what you can, Jack.

2047
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:56,860
别走  豪斯曼
Stay, Houseman.

2048
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:59,060
你会错过第三幕戏剧冲突的
You'll miss the third act complicator.

2049
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:01,430
去吧  杰克  立刻
Get going, Jack. Muy pronto.

2050
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:04,400
我想那是"立刻马上"意思
I believe that means right away.

2051
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,310
曼克  曼克
Mank, Mank.

2052
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:28,770
威利  我说那些主要是出于悲哀  而非愤怒
What I said was more in sorrow than in anger, Willie.

2053
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:36,270
你听说过"风琴师的猴子"这个寓言吗
Are you familiar with the parable of the organ grinder's monkey?

2054
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:40,400
风琴师的猴子体型娇小
Now, the organ grinder's monkey is tiny in stature,

2055
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,100
是从野外捕来的
and having been taken from the wild,

2056
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:47,110
它经常对周遭偌大的世界感到不知所措
he's naturally overwhelmed by the enormous world around him.

2057
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:51,150
但是每天早上  都有一位慈祥的老妇人
But every morning, a sweet elderly woman

2058
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:54,230
给它穿上精致的套装
dresses him in a fine suit of clothes.

2059
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,150
一件装饰有珍珠纽扣的红色天鹅绒马甲
She fits him with a red velvet vest adorned with pearl buttons

2060
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:02,980
还有一顶挂着真丝流苏的帅气红色毡帽
and a handsome red fez with a silk tassel.

2061
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:07,650
她给它穿上脚尖弯起的锦缎鞋
She slips on brocade shoes that curl at the toe,

2062
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:11,060
搭配一个镀金的精致音乐盒
and he's paired with a fine gilt music box

2063
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:13,670
用一条绝美的金链子
on an exquisite gold chain

2064
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:17,070
挂在它的脖子上
fastened to his neck and his neck alone.

2065
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:20,810
当它去往城里表演
Whenever he ventures into the city to perform,

2066
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:24,690
它会想  "我一定是个非常有权势的家伙
he thinks, "What a powerful fellow I must be."

2067
02:01:24,690 --> 02:01:29,020
瞧瞧这些人都耐心地等着看我跳舞"
"Look how patiently everyone waits just to watch me dance."

2068
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:32,020
-威利  -"不管我去哪里
- Willie... - "And wherever I go," he thinks,

2069
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:34,530
这个音乐盒都得跟着
"this music box must follow,

2070
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:38,360
还有这个可怜的受尽生活蹂躏的男人
and with it, this poor downtrodden man."

2071
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:41,150
如果我不想跳舞
"And if I chose not to dance,

2072
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:44,480
这个可怜的街头艺人就会挨饿
this sorry street peddler would starve,

2073
02:01:44,530 --> 02:01:49,150
每次我想要跳舞了  每一次
and every time I do decide to dance, every time...

2074
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:55,610
他都必须演奏
He must play."

2075
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:59,400
不管他情不情愿"
"Whether he wishes to or not."

2076
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:02,870
你今晚喝得太多了  赫尔曼
You've had a bit too much to drink, Herman.

2077
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:05,730
我让雷蒙德开车送你去车站
I'll get Raymond to drive you to the station.

2078
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:07,860
再见
Goodbye.

2079
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,060
先不提感激之情  曼克
Put aside gratitude, Mank.

2080
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:20,270
你创作出了最好的作品绝非偶然
That you've done your best work was no accident.

2081
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:23,600
我为你排除了所有的纷扰  所有的借口
I removed any distraction, eliminated every excuse,

2082
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:26,110
你的家人  狐朋狗友  酒精
your family, your cronies, liquor.

2083
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:27,980
我给了你第二次机会
I gave you a second chance.

2084
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,350
我万分感谢你所做的一切
And for that, I cannot thank you enough.

2085
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,350
但要想给冒了这么大风险的电影署名
But with credit for a risky undertaking

2086
02:02:32,350 --> 02:02:34,730
就必须承担真正的责任
must go the weight of real responsibility.

2087
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:37,190
鉴于你如今的健康状况  你真的想这么做吗
Given your current health, I wonder if you're up to it.

2088
02:02:37,190 --> 02:02:39,730
说实话我也不知道  但我们会弄清楚的
Frankly, I wonder, too, but we'll find out.

2089
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:42,630
你可能再也不能在这里工作了  曼克
You may never work in this town again, Mank!

2090
02:02:42,850 --> 02:02:44,400
奥森  拜托
Orson, please...

2091
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,650
你这是逼我提醒你
Then you force me to remind you!

2092
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:50,060
我们签了合同  你是了解细则也同意了的
We have a contract that you understood and agreed to!

2093
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:50,940
如果你要争署名权
If you fight this,

2094
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:53,810
这事就会闹到你的新工会所谓的仲裁
it will go to what your new guild calls arbitration,

2095
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:55,560
我的朋友
and you, my friend,

2096
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:57,440
你会输的  输掉剧本  金钱
will lose, script, money,

2097
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:00,020
假设在好莱坞还有人尊重你
and assuming such a thing still exists in Hollywood,

2098
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:02,270
你也会失去言而有信之人的尊重
the respect of those who honor their word.

2099
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:05,110
我该怎么礼貌地说呢
How can I put this nicely?

2100
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:08,150
我也许是个我行我素的人
I may be a loose cannon,

2101
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:11,150
但是你  我的朋友  你是局外人
but you, my friend, are an outsider.

2102
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:13,850
我激怒了他们  这是我应得的
They're exasperated by me, and I've earned it,

2103
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:17,690
但是你这个自诩八面玲珑的救世主
but you, a self-anointed savior-hyphenate,

2104
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:20,260
只会招来他们的厌恶
they're just waiting to loathe you.

2105
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:23,270
我再也不会跟一个江郎才尽的酗酒者合作
Remind me never again to work with a washed-up alcoholic!

2106
