know anything about women.

931
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,039
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,

932
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,998
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!

933
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:54,036
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.

934
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,589
We try to be what they want us to be.

935
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:03,108
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.

936
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,356
And then what happens?

937
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,512
They get bored -
that's what happens.

938
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:17,790
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?

939
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,833
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,

940
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,753
and roll over, and play dead.

941
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,238
From now on,
what you see is what you get.

942
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,472
For fuck's sake!

943
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,279
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

944
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,433
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

945
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,070
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

946
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,233
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

947
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,230
Whoo!

948
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,790
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

949
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,236
Whoa, easy, easy!

950
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,232
Oh, my God!

951
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,437
What was that?

952
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,556
Fat bird.

953
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,030
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

954
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,756
<i>Hello, hello...</i>

955
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,951
<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

956
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,317
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

957
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,552
In the nest with the stiffs.

958
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,711
<i>(GRAHAM) Where are you?</i>

959
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,077
Coming to get you, silly twat.

960
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,077
(NEIL) Let's do it.

961
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,149
Ew...

962
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,236
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

963
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,798
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

964
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,077
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

965
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,268
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

966
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,953
Yeah.

967
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,074
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

968
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,356
Pass one of them golf clubs.

969
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,353
No, give me a wood.

970
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,511
Give him wood as well.

971
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,190
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

972
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,476
But I've got the hump.

973
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,633
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

974
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,872
and... present company
excepted, of course,

975
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,158
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.

976
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,356
Bloody hell, Vince...

977
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,916
...not very PC is it?

978
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,749
Come on.

979
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,872
(NEIL) Let's have it!

981
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,192
Now what?

982
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,235
Oi, oi!

983
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,236
You all right?

984
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,031
I've got it working.

985
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,077
Let me see that, let me see that.

- (NEIL) Oh, my word!

990
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,199
Take that.

991
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,639
Get in there, Graham.

992
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,751
(VINCE) Be careful, Neil.

993
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,078
Whoa!

994
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,078
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.

995
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,232
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?

996
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,471
Whoa, whoa!

997
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,277
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!
