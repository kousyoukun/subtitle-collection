Fuck...

2
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,550
Fuckin' hell!

3
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,150
What's the matter with you? What?

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,990
- I'm not a bloody prostitute!
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,310
Christ's sake, this was our second date!

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,860
Was it? Listen, listen, all right...

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,710
I was on the tequilas
last night and, um...

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,070
- What is your name again?
- You're kidding.

9
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,800
Tell you what, if you was a prostitute...

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,910
you know... you'd be caked.

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,150
What's the matter with you?
That was a compliment!

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,070
You know what I mean, I can't win!
I've got the pox of it.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,830
Tell you something else,
you're only an old dog, anyway.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,870
Maybe "boys' weekend,"
wasn't the best choice of words.

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,630
Whatever. Have a nice time.

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,470
I'm not one of those guys
who ditches his mates for his girlfriend!

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,390
- I don't want you to ditch your mates!
- What DO you want?

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,470
An invite would've been nice.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,630
No girls allowed, darling.

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,070
I didn't know
there was gonna be strippers!

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,750
- And Neil's not in charge. I am.
- That fills me with confidence.

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,550
I'm only going to my gran's.
I'll be back on Monday.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,870
I'll have the locks changed before then.

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,190
Bex, Bex...
It's for Vince. Vince!

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,990
He's helped me
out so many times, I've lost count.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,190
When I first came to London,
he supported me. I owe him.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,550
Lots of people get divorced, Mikey.
He'll get over it.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,230
Yes, by spending a weekend
getting trollied with his mates.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,390
Well, you can celebrate
your own divorce with him!

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,710
I thought you'd react like that,
so I glued your ring on.

31
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,990
- See you Monday, babe. Love you too!
- Mikey, if you walk out that gate...

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,750
You don't know whether
you're coming or going, do you?

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,230
Patrick!

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,990
I'm going. I'm going!

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,430
The first weekend
my parents visit in years,

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,030
and you bugger off to the wilderness
to rediscover your testicles!

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,310
It's bad enough I have to tell them
you've quit your job...

How many times have I told you
they're NOT zombies?!

45
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,430
- All right, calm down. It's only a comic.
- No, no, it's not only a comic.

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,030
This is a... It's a unique
and often misunderstood art form.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,590
This... is a painstakingly crafted,

of words and art, OK?

49

- Do you want it or not?

50
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,830
- No, it's stupid.
- Right, piss off!

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,620
- Go on. We're closing early, OK?
- What? Why?

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,670

You mean... you want
a bit of time alone with your missus.

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,390
Don't touch her. Get off her and get out!

55
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,990
Go on, then!

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,390
Go on, out!
And don't come back!

57

Little knob-end.

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,470
Vince, you're not getting out of this!

59
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,630
- You're coming with us!
- We're gonna have such a good time!

He's always late for everything.

He showed up on time for his wedding.

Why's that funny?

You should've seen him

I mean, they used to call him Fearless.

109
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,350
He would step out in front of
a raging bull just to protect his mates,

110
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,220
and still manage to buy the first round

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,390
Yeah, that's only 'cause you guys

118
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,550
Anyway, where were we?

119
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,710
Snap out of it, Vince.

He's lost his way.

All suffering from social gender anxiety.

124

Is that some sort of disease
or something?

125
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,150
Nobody knows, that's the problem.

126
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,310
The second you try
to figure it out... doomed.

127
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,910
Not you, Vince. We're gonna
bring you back from the brink.

128
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,270
- Oi, no smoking!
- Shut up.

129
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,950
- You're outnumbered.
- I'm terrified!

130
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,870
Slag.

131
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,310
- Charmer...
- Wha'? Wha'?

132
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,070
- Now, listen to me, boys...
- I thought it was funny.

133
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,870
This is the plan.

134
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,590
First thing we do in the country,
we piss up the trees, mark our territory.

135
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,510
Then we're gonna find a pub and drink
till we've forgotten how to speak.

136
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,270
We'll communicate in grunts like
cavemen, until we pass out in the woods.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,950
Any questions?

138
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,870
- Are you Michael? I'm the driver.
- Hey, she's the driver!

139
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,310
Wanna see my driver's license?

140
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,860
That's Mikey,
the little squirt sitting there.

141
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,430
I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?

142
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,550
I can tell you now it's not "babe".

143
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,670
It's gonna be a long drive, isn't it?

144
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,350
Looks like it's heading that way,
don't it?

145
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,950
I tell you what, let's start again.

146
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,550
- My name's Neil.
- My name's Ruth.

147
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,540
From now on it's Candy.

148
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,710
Ignore him, RUTH. He's a throwback.
He hasn't evolved properly.

149
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,870
Call me Candy.

150
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,350
Come on!

151
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,990
- Right, boys, you ready?
- Yeah!

152
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,700
Get on these 2 here, look.
A couple of right wrong 'uns.

153
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,590
I'll tell you what, women love me.

154
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,550
You got enough petrol, babe,
and all that, yeah?

155
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,150
- Have you called Banksy again?
- He'll show up.

156
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,710
He's like Mikey's missus.
You can't shake him off.

157
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,460
It looks nice, but it's a piece of shit.

158
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,430
- What?
- It's fucked.

159
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,390
But I've only had it 5 minutes.

160
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,990
Someone's run the knackers off it.
You can't fix that with a nice paint job.

161
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,390
You're the one
who's getting divorced, ain't you?

162
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,190
Thanks for bringing it up.

163
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,110
There's worse things
than getting divorced.

164
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,110
Rape, murder, castration.

165
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,630
Fair enough.

166
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,340
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?

167
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,030
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.

168
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,870
What do you mean weird?

169
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,550
Well, it's just a dead-end
in the middle of the woods.

170
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,590
There's nothing there.

171
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,060
When I saw the booking
I thought it was a wind-up.

172
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,910
Mikey says the women
outnumber the men 4 to 1.

173
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,670
Yes, they do, Neil.

174
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,310
- And obviously they're all gagging for it.
- Obviously.

175
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,670
An entire village
full of man-hungry women

176
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,950
waiting to jump the first band
of desperados rolling up from London.

177
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,870
Have you been there, then?

178
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,070
My firm hasn't booked
a job to Moodley in years.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,670
Oh, sod off.

180
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,670
<i>Don't fear. There's no cause for alarm.</i>

181
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,030
All is well.

182
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,990
Death is a natural part of life.

183
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,990
Anxiety about this
is an inbuilt survival reflex,

184
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,070
no longer required in this beautiful
predator-free world.

185
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,910
Welcome to the country.

186
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,350
I'll do it, then, shall I?

187
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,110
Yeah, well done.

188
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,590
What's your nana up to
this weekend, Mikey?

189
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,140
She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.

190
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,270
What builders?

191
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,350
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.

192
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,390
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?

193
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,350
- She doesn't know we're coming.
- Well... I did say...

194
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,830
- You fuckin' idiot.
- Listen, man, I know where the key is!

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,150
Jesus! This gets better and better.

196
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,550
I might just stay on the minibus
and wait for the return trip.

197
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,150
Gentlemen, you are all past
the point of no return.

198
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,550
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mikey.

199
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,510
It's not me. It's not me!

200
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,550
Hello? Yeah...

201
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,070
I told you I'd sign the papers.

202
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,310
Solicitors always say that.

203
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
I can't do nothing today.
I'm not in London.

204
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,870
Moodley... Moodley!

205
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,230
What do you mean it's a shit hole?

206
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,430
Hello? Hello?

207
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,030
Not my PS...

208
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,900
That's it. Give us that fucking thing.
I've had enough of this!

209
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,870
- I'm not having this.
- What are you gonna do?

210
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,070
- All the phones, off, in this bag.
- What?!

211
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,870
- OK? All of you. Come on!
- No, no, no.

212
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,550
Getting away from it all doesn't include
spousal abuse by T-Mobile.

213
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,710
- See you, darling.
- I need to ring my mum.

214
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,150
- You've got mine already.
- In the bag, sunshine.

215
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,110
- Ladies first.
- After you, then.

216
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,590
All right.

217
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,350
Mikey?! Is this it?

218
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,510
- Please tell me you took a wrong turn.
- Told you the place was a dead end.

219
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,240
Is that it? Is this?

220
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,190
Mikey!

221
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,030
We're in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

222
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,310
I'd leave all that, Mikey,
till we've done a bit of reconnaissance.

223
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,150
- We might not be staying.
- What do you mean not staying?

224
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,390
I'm off the clock for half an hour,
then I'm leaving...

225
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,550
with or without you.

226
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,470
Fiddlesticks!

227
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,750
On your head!

228
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,230
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You idiot!

229
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm sure this place used to be bigger
when I was, err... little.

230
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,430
Looks like the whole village
has fucked off with your nan.

231
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,590
Where's all the women, then?

232
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,990
When were you last here, Mikey?

233
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,830
- Well, it's been a few years.
- Right, come on. First things first.

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,510
Mikey, you break into your nan's house
and make sure I've got a bed for tonight.

235
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,750
The rest of us can get the beers in
at the... Cock & Bull,

236
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,510
and drink until Moodley
starts looking like Barbados.

237
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,670
And someone
go get Candy down for a drink.

238
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,510
I'll go.

239
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,300
Neil, if she sees you,
she's liable to drive away with our stuff.

240
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,790
What are you talking about?
Women love me.

241
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,310
Really?

242
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,710
You are a long way from
your sports car, though, aren't you?

243
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,910
I'm gonna go for a slash.
Get us a pint of the usual.

244
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,790
Oh, no, put your money away, Neil.
My shout!

245
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,990
Knob.

246
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,030
"Vote Meg Nut".

247
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,950
Meg Nut... Nut-meg...

248
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,990
"Sponsored by Wundawash. "

249
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,390
Oh, shit.

250
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,510
Yes! Yes, yes.

251
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,550
Oh, thank you, gnomie.

252
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,790
Hello?

253
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,150
I can't believe we jumped
on one of Mikey's schemes.

254
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,070
- His heart's in the right place.
- Shame his head is up his arse.

255
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,230
Come on, Pat.
Liven yourself up. Get 'em in.

256
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,750
Neil, Do you see any bar staff?

257
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,590
I think I just saw one in the khazi,
chucking up.

258
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,310
- Maybe they're all sick.
- What the fuck is that horrible stench?

259
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,550
It's the smoking ban, mate.
Get rid of the all the puffers,

260
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,390
you'll find out what a pub really
smells like - stale beer and piss.

261
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,990
No. It's something else.

262
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,350
Where the fuck's Matt?

263
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,190
All right, calm down.
You sound like a dolphin.

264
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,070
Idiot.

265
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,800
Look at that.

266
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,910
It's a knob in a box.

267
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,430
This is a joke, right?

268
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,310
Don't...

269
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,630
Hey, back up. Back up.

270
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,020
I will...

271
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,590
Looks like there is
life on Mars, after all.

272
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,150
- What's the matter with her?
- I think she's homeless.

273
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,750
300 miles from London, the only
person we see is selling the Big Issue.

274
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,830
- Let's get some change.
- I've got some, I've got some.

275
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,790
Hey! Hey!

276
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,150
Go Vince!

277
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,830
- It's not what it looks like, mate!
- Yeah?

278
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,110
Matt, call the police!

279
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,430
Go, Graham. Hit him!

280
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,070
Go on! Somebody else hit him!

281
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,750
Put the knife down, mate.

282
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,350
Put the knife down!

283
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,590
You lot, just listen to me!

284
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,990
- Hey, watch!
- She stabbed me!

285
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,910
All right, hey, hey!

286
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,870
- Oi! Oi!
- What are you doing?!

287
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,870
- Can we talk about this?
- Hang on, hang on.

288
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,430
Jesus...

289
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,190
- What... What's wrong with her?
- What do you mean?

290
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,230
She's like Evil Dead in your shop,
those things with the claws and teeth!

291
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,190
And she's not the only one.

292
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,390
Look! Look at that. Look, look.

293
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,870
- Back on the bus, then, eh?
- Yes, yes!

294
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,260
- What about Action Man?
- Oh, shit.

295
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,590
Come on! Leave him!

296
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,670
Candy, start her up, baby.
We're leaving.

297
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,200
Let's go somewhere else, then.

298
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,550
Yeah, OK.

299
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,550
Where's your nan's house, Mike?

300
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,230
Mike, your nan's house!

301
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,470
OK...

302
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,070
Let's take the scenic route.

303
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,150
Mikey... Get his gun.

304
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,190
YOU get it.

305
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,620
It's empty.

306
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,430
Oh, mate...

307
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,470
That is not cool...

308
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,790
Look at the state of him.

309
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,950
What?

310
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,390
He said, "Don't go in the woods. "

311
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,590
- Why?
- Why you asking me?

312
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,670
What's in the woods?

313
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,300
Everything... you've ever been afraid of.

314
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,430
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

315
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,470
Quick, quick, Graham!

316
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,590
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm gonna do it when I get the key!

317
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,470
These are multi-combat trousers!
They've got 11 pockets!

318
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,670
You missed her!

319
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,270
Open the fucking door!

320
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,430
- Vince!
- What?

321
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,790
Help me!

322
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,870
- I've got the key!
- OPEN IT, THEN!

323
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,630
Shut the back door!

324
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,990
Oi, oi!

325
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,110
They're moving away!

326
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,030
All right, you funny cunts,
how's this supposed to cheer me up?

327
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,750
- Phones are dead.
- "Let's put all the mobiles in a bag. "

328
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,910
- Good idea, Neil!
- You wanna talk about this some more?

329
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,670
Let's talk about the unliveable state
of this house we're staying in.

330
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,270
OK, back door's locked, kettle is on.

331
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,910
Neil.

332
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,230
- They're not coming back.
- So what's going on here?

333
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,230
It could be some kind of
chemical spillage.

334
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,830
Maybe one of the streams
has been polluted.

335
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,030
Patrick, when was the last time

336
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,510
you saw pollution turn somebody
into an axe murderer?

337
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,060
Candy didn't even get off the bus
and she still turned into that.

338
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,790
- So it must be in the air.
- Why haven't we got it? And him?

339
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,830
- Maybe only women get it.
- What kind of virus only affects women?

340
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,810
Bird flu.

341
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,150
So where did all the men go?

342
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,550
No, no, no!

343
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,790
What is it?

344
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,830
Are you fucking retarded?

345
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,150
All the men are dead.

346
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,910
- Sit down, Andy McNabb.
- Easy, mate. I'm not the enemy.

347
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,460
- Really? See, I think you are.
- Right...

348
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,990
We demand an explanation!

349
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,590
Is it a biological weapon
gone out of control?

350
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,430
It's classified is what it is.

351
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,310
It's hardly classified, mate,
it's running about in stilettos!

352
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,630
- I said sit down.
- Or what? Or what?

353
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,030
Oi! Oi! Oi!

354
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,190
Kettle's boiled.

355
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,230
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Gavin Wright.

356
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,870
We don't give fuck about your rank.
We want an explanation.

357
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,500
- It's virus.
- Why aren't we infected?

358
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,590
I thought you'd worked this one out.
Only women get it.

359
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,220
- Why?
- Just luck.

360
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,750
Oh, that's not funny. Is there a cure?

361
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,550
I don't think anybody
survived long enough to try.

362
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,510
But that's not my department.
I'm just here to shoot them.

363
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,950
- What?
- How did it start?

364
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,310
The only questions you need to ask are,

365
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,070
"How many are there?"
and, "Are they in our way?"

366
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,830
So, how many are there?

367
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,270
The whole village
has gone over to the dark side.

368
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,740
Most of them are out in the woods.

369
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,030
So if you're thinking
of hiking out of here, think again.

370
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,580
What the fuck are they doing
in the woods?

371
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,950
Maybe they're all taking a shit.
Women like to go to the toilet together.

372
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,710
What do you think they're doing?
They're looking for fresh meat.

373
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,020
- So what's your exit plan?
- Same as yours.

374
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,390
Get on the minibus
and fuck off out the way you came in.

375
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,230
Well, there's little problem
with your plan, Marvin.

376
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,070
Bad Candy lives on that bus.
And she's got a little skin complaint.

377
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,110
When she gets off the bus, start running
and don't stop until you hear the horn.

378
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,150
We'll come back and pick you up.

379
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,990
Why are you so sure
she's gonna follow me?

380
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,070
Women love you.

381
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,510
If you have to kill her, just do it.
She's not Candy anymore.

382
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,430
She never was. Her name's Ruth.

383
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,790
- Whatever.
- Well, stop calling her Candy.

384
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,830
Neil, now is not the time
to stop objectifying women.

385
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,670
Be new man tomorrow.

386
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,670
Today, we need you to be the misogynist
Neanderthal arsehole we know and love.

387
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,270
- You could get this virus next...
- Fuck off.

388
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,390
You even hit like a girl.

389
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,030
- What are you doing?
- Fucking go.

390
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,230
- Liberty-taker.
- Hurry up!

391
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,270
All right, I'm going.

392
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,100
Come on... Come and have a nibble.

393
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,710
You know you want it.

394
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,750
Bollocks.

395
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,110
Get off the...

396
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,350
- Go! Go!
- Quick, hurry up!

397
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,470
Get the phones!

398
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,030
Someone get the phones!

399
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,790
Bastards!

400
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,110
Fuckin' hell!

401
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,470
Oh, man. We are dog meat.

402
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,600
They're everywhere!

403
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,670
- Shit...
- Oh, man!

404
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,870
Julie?

405
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,510
Do you know her?

406
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,150
Yeah, yeah...
We had thing once, it didn't end well.

407
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,910
- I'm gonna be sick.
- How do you think I feel?!

408
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,990
The phones...
I've got the fucking phones!

409
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,710
Shit...

410
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,700
- Do something! You're the soldier!
- Look at the fucking size of her!

411
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,230
Oh, no...

412
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,110
Get her off me!

413
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,070
Look out, Vince. Look out!

414
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,590
Fuck! Come on!

415
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,630
Yeah!

416
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,750
Oh, look at your teeth!

417
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,110
Fuckin' hell! Patrick!

418
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,510
- We should start placing bets.
- My money's on that one.

419
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,510
Let's go!

420
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,030
Everyone stay together!

421
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,670
Here, here! Quick, come on.

422
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,550

Still in its original packaging!

00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,790
Weapons, Matt.
Grab any weapons you can.

428
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,260
Not fuckin' robots.

429
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,470
All right... I'm looking.

430
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,070
Did you lock that?

431
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,070
Matt! Matt!

432
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,910
Where are you going? Matt!

433
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,710
I'm coming!

434
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,830

435
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,790

- Give us a lighter!

THE OTHER POCKET!

438
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,910
Get back. If they can't see us,
they'll forget we're in here.

439
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,750
- That's optimistic, innit?
- They are easily confused.

NOW you decide to shoot someone,
you fucking monkey's arse-ring.

You had a gun all along?

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,350
I was saving the last bullet
for when I needed it.

443
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,230
You're still a twat.

444
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,630
Fuck, I think you've just sent out
a party invite.

445
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,300
Do they sell petrol in toy shops?

No.

It's Nitro Fluid for radio-controlled cars.

Don't you know anything?!

- I take it you're in a toy shop.
- Who's there? Is Neil there?

455
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,790
No, just me, Mikey
and the Milky Bar Kid.

456
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,750
- My name's Gavin.
- Whatever.

457
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,830
The speed Neil was running,
he's probably halfway home.

00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,310
We're both adults.

467
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,430
I'm a man...

468
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,140
You're a...

469
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,550
You're a woman.

470
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,950
This could be the start
of something special - you and me...

471
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,260
All you've gotta do...

472
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,630
is... untie me, yeah?

473
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,470
Just untie me, please.

474
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,550
Come on, then. Come on!

475
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,470
No, no, don't do that. No.

476
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,630
<i>Fear and panic are only
chemicals within your body.</i>

477
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,580
<i>Anxiety is nothing more
than a chemical reaction.</i>

478
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,550
So, what's the plan?

479
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,750
What do you mean what's the plan?

480
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,070
The plan. What's the plan?

481
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,030
- I haven't got one. What's yours?
- I've got a plan.

482
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,150
What's all this bollocks
with the walkie-talkies, then?

483
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,670
Just fancied a chat about
something other than Star Wars.

484
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,950
Oh... How is Matt?

485
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,430
Yeah, the force is with him.

486
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,910
- Oi!
- What?

487
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,590
I said I've got a plan.

488
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,510
Go on, then.

489
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,140
You're the double hard bastard.
You do it.

490
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,190
It's your plan, arsehole.

491
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,390
You two are so gay!

492
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,590
Your mum's an arsehole.

493
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,870
The payload has been delivered.

494
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,510
What?

495
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,830
The head's in the truck, man.
You ready?

496
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,910
We're gonna need a diversion
for our diversion.

497
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,390
I'm on it.

498
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,750
Come and get your meals on wheels.

499
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,150
No!

500
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,630
Fuck off!

501
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,300
Do the horn.

502
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,030
You're not getting the better of me.

503
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,710
Turn it, you're gonna go
out of range!

504
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,110
I'm turning it. I'm turning it!

505
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,390
Get off!

506
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,670
Oh, f... No!

507
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,190
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Fuckin' hell.

508
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,710
Fucking thing!

509
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,190
- How could things get any worse?
- Mikey?

510
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,230
- Yeah?
- Mikey, they've spotted you.

511
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,590
Great.

512
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,510
Yum!

513
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,670
Mikey?

514
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,230
Mikey?

515
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,250
Mikey!

516
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,070
Fuck.

517
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,750
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, wait. Wait.

518
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,790
I am not going out there half-cocked.

519
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,030
Let's party.

520
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,310
Where's mine?

521
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,190
Well, there's only one.

522
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,750
No, look, got a spare.

523
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,070
No?

524
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,030
All right, you can have my backup.

525
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,270
What's this?

526
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,910
I will make you feel sexy.

527
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,350
Yeah!

528
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,230
Right, then. Come on, Vince.
Me and you - Butch and Sundance!

529
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,070
- They both died.
- Yeah!

530
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,830
- Come on, you gimp. Let's go.
- Yeah!

531
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,910
Do your fire thing! Do the fire thing!

532
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,390
Hurry up!

533
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,590
Oh, shit!

534
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,070
Ta.

535
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,630
What do we do now?

536
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,190
We do what everyone else does,
when they're facing mortality.

537
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,030
Run.

538
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,590
Wait, wait.
I bet you a tenner it's locked.

539
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,280
- Bollocks.
- You owe me tenner.

540
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,310
Oh, my God.

541
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,500
Look, look.

542
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,190
<i>Mikey? Neil? Is anyone there?</i>

543
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,300
- Where's the walkie-talkie?
- Lads, can you hear me?

544
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,070
Me and Matt, we're in the church
but we've lock ed the doors.

545
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,630
So if you get over here, please
just let me know. Try and get over here.

546
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,230
We have to get out of here.

547
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,790
Let's follow your mates over
to the church. It's our best chance.

548
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,870
I think it's a bit late
to start praying, don't you?

549
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,830
You feeling all right, mate?

550
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,380
I have just had a genius idea.

551
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,110
- Is everyone ready?
- You're loving this, aren't you?

552
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,270
- Garry?
- It's Gavin.

553
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,470
Let's just get it over with.

554
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,630
- What?
- You've done this before, haven't you?

555
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,070
- Don't get any funny ideas
- Don't worry, he's not a lesbian.

556
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,750
- Is this gonna work or what?
- Let's try.

557
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,950
Here she is!

558
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,870
Vince, open the church door.

559
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,710
Oh, fuck.

560
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,470
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, come on!

561
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,110
No, no, no! Don't go in there!
Don't go in there!

562
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,950
Wait! That's my 9-iron.

563
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,270
Come on!

564
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,310
- Oh, Christ, it's the ex.
- Vince, we're outside. Open the door.

565
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,910
Don't move, just keep smiling.

566
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,070
Our clothes are in there! Shit!

567
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,430
Oh, for fuck's sake, Julie.
We split up, get over it!

568
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,110
All right, gays... guys!

569
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,820
- Where did you come from?
- I took the scenic route.

570
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,870
Come on.

571
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,990
I hate you. I hate you.

572
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,950
Why don't you just sit on me
and get it over with, you fat fucking pig!

573
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,430
Vince.

574
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,270
- I really wanna go home.
- OK. OK, let's go.

575
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,150
Let's go home.

576
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,950
Vince, are you taking piss?
This isn't funny any more.

577
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,350
- Let us in.
- Hold on, we're coming.

578
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,630
- Come on, hurry up!
- What are they doing?

579
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,630
- What are you doing...
- What the fuck's this?!

580
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,470
- Don't laugh at me!
- Neil! Neil!

581
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,310
- Oi!
- Where the fuck have you been?

582
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,670
(Bad-ass Crazy Lady)

583
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,430
<i># She's dressed to kill
Oh, what a thrill</i>

584
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,590
<i># Mess with her
And you're bound to get ill</i>

585
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,270
<i># She'll chew you up and spit you out</i>

586
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,000
- # She'll leave a scar...
- Hello, girls.

587
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,350
- # She knows what she likes...
- Who's first?

588
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,190
<i># She looks at me with those crazy eyes</i>

589

- I'll call you.

597
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,270
Show's over. Everyone get inside.

598
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,350
- I don't think so.
- Is that supposed to frighten me?

599
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,830
- He said it would make me fell sexy.
- Does it?

600
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,950
A little bit, yeah.

601
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,630
Oh, for God's sake!

602
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,670
Can we leave this male posturing
bullshit till later?

603
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,230
Everyone get inside!

604
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,350
I don't think I actually ever used
that finger for anything.

605
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,470
- There's nothing up here.
- Come back, then.

606
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,950
We're nearly there.

607
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,470
Oh, shut up, you girl.

608
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,470
That's it.

609
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,590
Talking of girls...

610
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,630
There's not even a spare
choir-boy outfit up there.

611
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,360
Sit down, silly-bollocks,
you look gorgeous.

612
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:04,030
- I think that butcher took a shine to you.
- Nah, she's not my type, that one.

613
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,830
What about one of the others?

614
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,110
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Don't you ever have a day off?

615
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,190
There were 3 kinky birds
in that house.

616
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,740
For second, I thought, you know...

617
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,620
as long as they don't start
with that sicking-up bollocks...

618
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,180
The one with the, um,
scissors is pretty fit.

619
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,430
She'll have your bollocks for earrings
before you've even bought her a drink.

620
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,230
- I like the one with the axe.
- She's married.

621
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,630
I can't believe this!
You people have no respect for women.

622
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,870
Oh, come on, Graham.
That's why you bat for the other side?

623
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,270
All women are mental.

624
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,750
You can't make that kind of sweeping
generalisation about an entire gender.

625
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,710
Why not? Look at us.

626
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,910
Look at Vince. His glory days are over.
His missus did that to him.

627
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,780
He was king when he met her.
She turned him into a fucking ghost.

628
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,230
We brought him out here to convince
him that all women aren't out to get him.

629
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,190
Yeah, thanks for that, lads.

630
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,590
It's all gone really fuckin' well, innit?

631
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,790
- What are you looking for?
- Yes.

632
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,830
This.

633
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,990
I've done it!

634
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,950
Right.

635
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,990
Wow, we've got the whole village
under surveillance.

636
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,480
Well, it's about time.

637
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,150
You've been offline for nearly 24 hours.

638
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,270
And why was my so-called escort
called back to Moodley last night,

639
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,550
and left me chained
to the fucking briefcase?

640
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,310
That's Meg Nut from the poster, look.

641
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,830
Who are you?

642
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,870
You're not involved
with Project Cat-house.

643
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,150
Where's the Colonel?

644
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,510
- Get her back.
- It's on fire.

645
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,790
It's happening.

646
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,830
- What's happening?
- Phase II.

647
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,670
Hold on a minute. What's Phase I?

648
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,380
Sickness, disorientation, psychosis.

649
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,470
Phase II is the mutation.

650
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,630
They're gonna get smarter,
faster and weirder.

651
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,620
- What's that?
- It's called The Dolphin.

652
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,870
There are high-frequency
sonic deterrents all over the village,

653
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,230
emitting painful sound
only women can hear.

654
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,990
- So there was a fail-safe all along.
- It only works after Phase II.

655
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,270
- Obviously.
- Well, stop talking and press the button.

656
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,790
- Is it working?
- I dunno.

657
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,670
Can YOU hear it?

658
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,310
Um, that doesn't work, does it?

659
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,860
This isn't funny.
They'll be relentless now.

660
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,870
They hunt in packs. We are fucked!

661
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,670
For the sake of clarity, we're not dealing
with few insane women any more.

662
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,070
What you boys
have actually created here

663
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,470
is an army of pissed off,
man-hating, feminist cannibals.

664
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,990
This biological weapon can turn one half
of the population against the other.

665
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,630
- We can fight wars with no armies.
- So this is a test run?

666
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,550
You set the virus loose
in an isolated little village

667
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,790
and then sit and watch it on the telly?

668
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,230
They used to do this kind of thing
in the '50s with LSD.

669
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,590
Thanks, Matthew. What does
Meg Nut have to do with this?

670
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,350
- Not much. She's just a delivery girl.
- Yeah. But delivering WHAT?

671
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,670
How fucking stupid are you people?
What do you think?

672
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,830
A free box of Wundawash?

673
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,230
The virus
is in the washing powder, look.

674
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,910
It's biological.

675
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,270
Everybody, get back.

676
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,780
- Leave her out of it. That's my nan.
- I thought she was on a cruise.

677
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,670
Yeah... So did I.

678
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,470
Matt. Matt, no!

679
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,220
You've, um...

680
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,350
There's some stuff on your face.

681
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,590
All right, Matt?

682
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,070
Thank you.

683
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,360
Don't go in there, Matt.
It's the mortuary.

684
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,350
I think he's traumatised.

685
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,750
I'm the one who's fucking traumatised!
Look what he did to my nan.

686
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,990
Matt? Matt?

687
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,910
Matt...

688
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,350
Vince. Run, run!

689
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,550
What's happened?

690
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,430
Is he all right?

691
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,510
No.

692
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,140
So, where is he, then?

693
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,750
He's dead.

694
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,950
Come on!

695
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,750
That's for Matt...

696
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,790
bitch.

697
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,110
Shit, shit...

698
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,710
- Look at the state of him.
- We can't just leave him here.

699
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,870
What, in mortuary?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

700
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,580
I'm just as freaked out as you are.

701
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,750
What was that?

702
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,630
Vince, don't go down there,
that's how she got in.

703
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,870
Yeah, and it might be our only way out.

704
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,310
- It's the other half of Moodley.
- Jesus, it's all the men.

705
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,270
- You mean parts of them.
- It's a nest.

706
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,790
Come on, come on!

707
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,990
- Get up, come on!
- Get up!

708
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,230
Get up the stairs! Come on!

709
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,230
Vince, Vince! Come on!

710
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,350
- Neil! Neil!
- Close the door!

711
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,190
Neil, give us a hand with this!

712
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,950
Hurry up, will ya?

713
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,470
Oi, what are you pair of tarts
doing up there?

714
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,630
Banksy, what time do you call this?

715
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,310
You would not believe
the shit day I've had.

716
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,150
- What's going on?
- Listen, soft-lad,

717
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,590
outside Mikey's nan's house, there's
a big ladder, go and bring it back here.

718
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,510
What's with the...

719
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,950
- Get the fucking ladder, soppy bollocks.
- Hurry up.

720
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,030
All right, all right,
don't get all aggressive.

721
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,910
Fuck, help me out!

722
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,790
- Get your ass outside.
- I think I'll stay a bit.

723
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,190
Get your ass outside now.
Go, fuck off.

724
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,750
Pat, go on.

725
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,910
- All right?
- Vince?

726
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,990
Hurry up!

727
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,630
I can see your bikini line from here.
What's with the frock?

728
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,040
- What are you doing?
- Vince said a get ladder.

729
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,990
So we can get down, you plank,
not so you can get up.

730
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,790
- What's happening?
- All the women have gone evil.

731
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,430
One of them ate Neil's finger,
Matt killed me nan with a 9-iron

732
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,220
and now he's dead, and we need
to get down the sodding ladder. Down.

733
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,510
You lot been taking drugs?

734
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,670
- You got some left?
- Get down, get down!

735
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,550
Move, move!

736
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,310
Go back up!

737
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,030
We're alive!

738
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,430
Let go!

739
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,230
Who's the monster?

740
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,960
- What are you still doing here?
- Wishing I wasn't.

741
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,950
- Come on!
- Come on, Pat. Come here.

742
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,990
- Come on, Pat.
- Watch his leg!

743
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,630
- Graham, come on, let's go.
- You go.

744
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,260
I'm right behind you.

745
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,390
Fuck me.

746
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,590
Fuckin' hell.

747
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,830
This is worse than
the fucking Pamplona Bull Run.

748
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,270
Fuckin' hell!

749
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,430
Jesus!

750
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,390
- Get the ladder. Get the ladder.
- What's this one?

751
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,790
Come on!

752
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,590
- Come on!
- Vince, Vince...

753
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,190
- Banksy, give us your phone.
- I left it at home.

754
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,660
Right, of course, yeah...

755
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,430
Where are you parked, then?

756
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,230
Behind the big billboard lying
across the street.

757
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,550
What's that?

758
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,630
- It's a rental.
- It's a rental?

759
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,030
What do you mean it's a rental?
Where's your van?

760
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,190
- It broke down, I forgot.
- You forgot?

761
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,710
Repeating everything I say
ain't gonna help, Vince.

762
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,440
What's not gonna help
is that fuckin' moon buggy.

763
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,310
Maybe we can squeeze in.
I'll sit on someone's lap.

764
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,910
Shut up. Forget it, it's too small.
Why did you even get here?

765
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,030
- What are you trying to say?
- This trip was bad a idea.

766
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,030
No... really?

767
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,230
- It could be worse.
- It could be worse?

768
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,710
How many fingers am I holding up?
They're fucking eating us!

769
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,420
- How can it get any worse?
- Can everyone shut the fuck up?

770
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,830
Cracking skulls open with a 9-iron
is not my idea of golfing holiday!

771
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,620
But this is not Mikey's fault,
and it's not Banksy's.

772
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,360
I'm sure as fucking shit,
it's not mine either.

773
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,350
Relax... Relax...

774
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:18,360
Now, we all need to work together
to facilitate some kind of positive -

775
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,590
and I mean POSITIVE escape scenario,
'cause I'm not dying in this shit hole!

776
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,390
<i>There's nothing wrong with you
that can't be fixed with a smile.</i>

777
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,670
Get on the bus.

778
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,910
Come on!

779
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,910
Ruth!

780
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,710
Banksy!

781
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,750
Banksy!

782
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,470
Banksy!

783
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,310
Come on! I've had enough
of standing here!

784
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,470
I'll fuckin stick it in ya!
I'll fucking stick it in ya!

785
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,590
Get in the fucking bus!

786
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,270
I'm fucking sick of it! Fuck!

787
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,350
Come on, Vince, let's go!
Let's go!

788
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,710
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.

789
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,830
What, now? Can't it wait?

790
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,350
No.

791
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,870
Well, it's about fucking time.

792
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,870
Anyone seen me lighter?

793
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,150
Where's me lighter?

794
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,750
Oi, look after it next time, yeah?

795
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,750
You know, I always thought you two
were completely fucking useless.

796
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,310
You - you just follow your dick
like it's a fucking compass.

797
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,350
And you - you're letting your marriage
slip through your fucking fingers.

798
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,820
Neither of you
know anything about women.

799
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,030
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,

800
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,990
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!

801
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:44,030
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.

802
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,580
We try to be what they want us to be.

803
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:53,100
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.

804
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,350
And then what happens?

805
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,510
They get bored -
that's what happens.

806
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,790
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?

807
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,830
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,

808
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,750
and roll over, and play dead.

809
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,230
From now on,
what you see is what you get.

810
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,470
For fuck's sake!

811
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,270
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

812
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,430
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

813
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,070
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

814
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,230
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

815
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,790
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

816
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,230
Whoa, easy, easy!

817
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,230
Oh, my God!

818
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,430
What was that?

819
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,550
Fat bird.

820
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,030
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

821
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,750
Hello, hello...

822
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,950
Hello? Is anybody there?

823
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,310
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

824
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,550
In the nest with the stiffs.

825
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,710
Where are you?

826
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,070
Coming to get you, silly twat.

827
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,070
Let's do it.

828
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,230
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

829
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,790
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

830
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,070
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

831
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:50,260
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

832
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,950
Yeah.

833
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:56,070
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

834
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,350
Pass one of them golf clubs.

835
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,350
No, give me a wood.

836
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,510
Give him wood as well.

837
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,190
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

838
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,470
But I've got the hump.

839
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,630
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

840
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,870
and... present company
excepted, of course,

841
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,150
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.

842
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,350
Bloody hell, Vince...

843
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,910
not very PC is it?

844
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,740
Come on.

845
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,870
Let's have it!

846
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,190
Now what?

847
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,230
Oi, oi!

848
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,230
You all right?

849
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,030
I've got it working.

850
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,070
Let me see that, let me see that.

851
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,670
Remote-controlled women.

852
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,790
- Do it again, Neil!
- My word!

853
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,190
Take that.

854
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,630
Get in there, Graham.

855
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,750
Be careful, Neil.

856
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,070
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.

857
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,230
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?

858
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,270
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!

859
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,430
Bollocks!

860
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,550
Go!
