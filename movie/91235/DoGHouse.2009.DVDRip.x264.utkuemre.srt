Fuck...

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,558
Fuckin' hell!

3
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,154
What's the matter with you? What?

4
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,995
- I'm not a bloody prostitute!
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,316
Christ's sake, this was our second date!

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,869
Was it? Listen, listen, all right...

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,713
I was on the tequilas
last night and, um...

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,070
- What is your name again?
- You're kidding.

9
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,800
Tell you what, if you was a prostitute...

10
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,916
you know... you'd be caked.

11
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,159
What's the matter with you?
That was a compliment!

12
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,074
You know what I mean, I can't win!
I've got the pox of it.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,833
Tell you something else,
you're only an old dog, anyway.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,878
Maybe "boys' weekend,"
wasn't the best choice of words.

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,632
Whatever. Have a nice time.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,475
I'm not one of those guys
who ditches his mates for his girlfriend!

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,393
- I don't want you to ditch your mates!
- What DO you want?

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,471
An invite would've been nice.

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,631
No girls allowed, darling.

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,070
I didn't know
there was gonna be strippers!

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,755
- And Neil's not in charge. I am.
- That fills me with confidence.

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,559
I'm only going to my gran's.
I'll be back on Monday.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,870
I'll have the locks changed before then.

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,196
Bex, Bex...
It's for Vince. Vince!

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,999
He's helped me
out so many times, I've lost count.

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,197
When I first came to London,
he supported me. I owe him.

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,557
Lots of people get divorced, Mikey.
He'll get over it.

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,235
Yes, by spending a weekend
getting trollied with his mates.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,392
Well, you can celebrate
your own divorce with him!

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,711
I thought you'd react like that,
so I glued your ring on.

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,998
- See you Monday, babe. Love you too!
- Mikey, if you walk out that gate...

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,756
You don't know whether
you're coming or going, do you?

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,237
Patrick!

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,993
I'm going. I'm going!

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,435
The first weekend
my parents visit in years,

36
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,036
and you bugger off to the wilderness
to rediscover your testicles!

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,317
It's bad enough I have to tell them
you've quit your job...

How many times have I told you
they're NOT zombies?!

45
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,439
- All right, calm down. It's only a comic.
- No, no, it's not only a comic.

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,037
This is a... It's a unique
and often misunderstood art form.

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,590
This... is a painstakingly crafted,

of words and art, OK?

- Do you want it or not?

- No, it's stupid.
- Right, piss off!

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,629
- Go on. We're closing early, OK?
- What? Why?

a bit of time alone with your missus.

54
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,395
Don't touch her. Get off her and get out!

55
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,994
Go on, then!

56
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,390
Go on, out!
And don't come back!

He showed up on time for his wedding.

You should've seen him

I mean, they used to call him Fearless.

109
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,357
He would step out in front of
a raging bull just to protect his mates,

110
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,229
and still manage to buy the first round

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,393
Yeah, that's only 'cause you guys

118
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,555
Anyway, where were we?

119
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,712
Snap out of it, Vince.

He's lost his way.

All suffering from social gender anxiety.

Is that some sort of disease
or something?

125
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,157
Nobody knows, that's the problem.

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,312
The second you try
to figure it out... doomed.

127
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,918
Not you, Vince. We're gonna
bring you back from the brink.

128
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,278
- Oi, no smoking!
- Shut up.

129
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,956
- You're outnumbered.
- I'm terrified!

130
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,872
Slag.

131
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,315
- Charmer...
- Wha'? Wha'?

132
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,075
- Now, listen to me, boys...
- I thought it was funny.

133
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,878
This is the plan.

134
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,591
First thing we do in the country,
we piss up the trees, mark our territory.

135
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,514
Then we're gonna find a pub and drink
till we've forgotten how to speak.

136
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,276
We'll communicate in grunts like
cavemen, until we pass out in the woods.

137
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,956
Any questions?

138
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,871
- Are you Michael? I'm the driver.
- Hey, she's the driver!

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,310
Wanna see my driver's license?

140
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,869
That's Mikey,
the little squirt sitting there.

141
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,437
I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?

142
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,556
I can tell you now it's not "babe".

143
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,678
It's gonna be a long drive, isn't it?

144
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,354
Looks like it's heading that way,
don't it?

145
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,954
I tell you what, let's start again.

146
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,554
- My name's Neil.
- My name's Ruth.

147
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,549
From now on it's Candy.

148
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,713
Ignore him, RUTH. He's a throwback.
He hasn't evolved properly.

149
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,876
Call me Candy.

150
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,357
Come on!

151
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,999
- Right, boys, you ready?
- Yeah!

152
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,709
Get on these 2 here, look.
A couple of right wrong 'uns.

153
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,597
I'll tell you what, women love me.

154
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,550
You got enough petrol, babe,
and all that, yeah?

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,157
- Have you called Banksy again?
- He'll show up.

156
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,710
He's like Mikey's missus.
You can't shake him off.

157
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,469
It looks nice, but it's a piece of shit.

158
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,437
- What?
- It's fucked.

159
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,397
But I've only had it 5 minutes.

160
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,997
Someone's run the knackers off it.
You can't fix that with a nice paint job.

161
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,399
You're the one
who's getting divorced, ain't you?

162
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,198
Thanks for bringing it up.

163
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,113
There's worse things
than getting divorced.

164
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,113
Rape, murder, castration.

165
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,635
Fair enough.

166
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,349
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?

167
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,035
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.

168
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,872
What do you mean weird?

169
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,554
Well, it's just a dead-end
in the middle of the woods.

170
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,598
There's nothing there.

171
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,069
When I saw the booking
I thought it was a wind-up.

172
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,913
Mikey says the women
outnumber the men 4 to 1.

173
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,675
Yes, they do, Neil.

174
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,318
- And obviously they're all gagging for it.
- Obviously.

175
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,675
An entire village
full of man-hungry women

176
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,957
waiting to jump the first band
of desperados rolling up from London.

177
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,870
Have you been there, then?

178
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,079
My firm hasn't booked
a job to Moodley in years.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,672
Oh, sod off.

180
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,670
<i>Don't fear. There's no cause for alarm.</i>

181
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,035
All is well.

182
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,998
Death is a natural part of life.

183
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,994
Anxiety about this
is an inbuilt survival reflex,

184
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,076
no longer required in this beautiful
predator-free world.

185
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,910
Welcome to the country.

186
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,356
I'll do it, then, shall I?

187
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,119
Yeah, well done.

188
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,598
What's your nana up to
this weekend, Mikey?

189
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,149
She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.

190
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,276
What builders?

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,352
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.

192
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,398
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?

193
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,358
- She doesn't know we're coming.
- Well... I did say...

194
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,832
- You fuckin' idiot.
- Listen, man, I know where the key is!

195
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,150
Jesus! This gets better and better.

196
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,551
I might just stay on the minibus
and wait for the return trip.

197
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,157
Gentlemen, you are all past
the point of no return.

198
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,550
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mikey.

199
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,517
It's not me. It's not me!

200
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,555
Hello? Yeah...

201
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,075
I told you I'd sign the papers.

202
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
Solicitors always say that.

203
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
I can't do nothing today.
I'm not in London.

204
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,874
Moodley... Moodley!

205
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,235
What do you mean it's a shit hole?

206
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,437
Hello? Hello?

207
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,034
Not my PS...

208
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,909
That's it. Give us that fucking thing.
I've had enough of this!

209
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,875
- I'm not having this.
- What are you gonna do?

210
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,079
- All the phones, off, in this bag.
- What?!

211
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,879
- OK? All of you. Come on!
- No, no, no.

212
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,555
Getting away from it all doesn't include
spousal abuse by T-Mobile.

213
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,712
- See you, darling.
- I need to ring my mum.

214
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,156
- You've got mine already.
- In the bag, sunshine.

215
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,114
- Ladies first.
- After you, then.

216
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,591
All right.

217
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,350
Mikey?! Is this it?

218
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,513
- Please tell me you took a wrong turn.
- Told you the place was a dead end.

219
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,240
Is that it? Is this?

220
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,197
Mikey!

221
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,035
We're in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

222
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,318
I'd leave all that, Mikey,
till we've done a bit of reconnaissance.

223
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,156
- We might not be staying.
- What do you mean not staying?

224
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,392
I'm off the clock for half an hour,
then I'm leaving...

225
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,551
with or without you.

226
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,477
Fiddlesticks!

227
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,751
On your head!

228
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,238
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You idiot!

229
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,909
I'm sure this place used to be bigger
when I was, err... little.

230
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,432
Looks like the whole village
has fucked off with your nan.

231
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,591
Where's all the women, then?

232
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,990
When were you last here, Mikey?

233
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,836
- Well, it's been a few years.
- Right, come on. First things first.

234
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,516
Mikey, you break into your nan's house
and make sure I've got a bed for tonight.

235
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,752
The rest of us can get the beers in
at the... Cock & Bull,

236
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,514
and drink until Moodley
starts looking like Barbados.

237
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,671
And someone
go get Candy down for a drink.

238
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,512
I'll go.

239
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,309
Neil, if she sees you,
she's liable to drive away with our stuff.

240
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,790
What are you talking about?
Women love me.

241
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,313
Really?

242
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,711
You are a long way from
your sports car, though, aren't you?

243
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,913
I'm gonna go for a slash.
Get us a pint of the usual.

244
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,799
Oh, no, put your money away, Neil.
My shout!

245
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,997
Knob.

246
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,031
"Vote Meg Nut".

247
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,953
Meg Nut... Nut-meg...

248
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,996
"Sponsored by Wundawash. "

249
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,396
Oh, shit.

250
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,515
Yes! Yes, yes.

251
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,556
Oh, thank you, gnomie.

252
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,793
Hello?

253
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,157
I can't believe we jumped
on one of Mikey's schemes.

254
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,074
- His heart's in the right place.
- Shame his head is up his arse.

255
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,232
Come on, Pat.
Liven yourself up. Get 'em in.

256
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,755
Neil, Do you see any bar staff?

257
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,593
I think I just saw one in the khazi,
chucking up.

258
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,311
- Maybe they're all sick.
- What the fuck is that horrible stench?

259
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,552
It's the smoking ban, mate.
Get rid of the all the puffers,

260
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,395
you'll find out what a pub really
smells like - stale beer and piss.

261
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,994
No. It's something else.

262
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,352
Where the fuck's Matt?

263
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,195
All right, calm down.
You sound like a dolphin.

264
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,078
Idiot.

265
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,800
Look at that.

266
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,914
It's a knob in a box.

267
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,437
This is a joke, right?

268
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,317
Don't...

269
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,635
Hey, back up. Back up.

270
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,028
I will...

271
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,591
Looks like there is
life on Mars, after all.

272
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,158
- What's the matter with her?
- I think she's homeless.

273
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,757
300 miles from London, the only
person we see is selling the Big Issue.

274
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,833
- Let's get some change.
- I've got some, I've got some.

275
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,795
Hey! Hey!

276
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,158
Go Vince!

277
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,835
- It's not what it looks like, mate!
- Yeah?

278
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,110
Matt, call the police!

279
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,433
Go, Graham. Hit him!

280
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,075
Go on! Somebody else hit him!

281
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,755
Put the knife down, mate.

282
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,354
Put the knife down!

283
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,595
You lot, just listen to me!

284
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,997
- Hey, watch!
- She stabbed me!

285
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,912
All right, hey, hey!

286
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,876
- Oi! Oi!
- What are you doing?!

287
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,876
- Can we talk about this?
- Hang on, hang on.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,433
Jesus...

289
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,197
- What... What's wrong with her?
- What do you mean?

290
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,239
She's like Evil Dead in your shop,
those things with the claws and teeth!

291
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,190
And she's not the only one.

292
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,394
Look! Look at that. Look, look.

293
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,874
- Back on the bus, then, eh?
- Yes, yes!

294
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,269
- What about Action Man?
- Oh, shit.

295
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,590
Come on! Leave him!

296
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,672
Candy, start her up, baby.
We're leaving.

297
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,200
Let's go somewhere else, then.

298
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,552
Yeah, OK.

299
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,552
Where's your nan's house, Mike?

300
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,233
Mike, your nan's house!

301
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,479
OK...

302
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,074
Let's take the scenic route.

303
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,150
Mikey... Get his gun.

304
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,191
YOU get it.

305
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,629
It's empty.

306
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,438
Oh, mate...

307
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,477
That is not cool...

308
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,790
Look at the state of him.

309
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,955
What?

310
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,391
He said, "Don't go in the woods. "

311
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,596
- Why?
- Why you asking me?

312
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,675
What's in the woods?

313
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,308
Everything... you've ever been afraid of.

314
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,432
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

315
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,470
Quick, quick, Graham!

316
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,598
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm gonna do it when I get the key!

317
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,479
These are multi-combat trousers!
They've got 11 pockets!

318
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,670
You missed her!

319
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,279
Open the fucking door!

320
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,433
- Vince!
- What?

321
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,794
Help me!

322
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,871
- I've got the key!
- OPEN IT, THEN!

323
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,630
Shut the back door!

324
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,999
Oi, oi!

325
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,116
They're moving away!

326
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,035
All right, you funny cunts,
how's this supposed to cheer me up?

327
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,757
- Phones are dead.
- "Let's put all the mobiles in a bag. "

328
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,912
- Good idea, Neil!
- You wanna talk about this some more?

329
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,675
Let's talk about the unliveable state
of this house we're staying in.

330
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,274
OK, back door's locked, kettle is on.

331
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,919
Neil.

332
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,234
- They're not coming back.
- So what's going on here?

333
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,232
It could be some kind of
chemical spillage.

334
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,834
Maybe one of the streams
has been polluted.

335
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,036
Patrick, when was the last time

336
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,512
you saw pollution turn somebody
into an axe murderer?

337
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,069
Candy didn't even get off the bus
and she still turned into that.

338
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,795
- So it must be in the air.
- Why haven't we got it? And him?

339
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,839
- Maybe only women get it.
- What kind of virus only affects women?

340
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,813
Bird flu.

341
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,156
So where did all the men go?

342
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,553
No, no, no!

343
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,798
What is it?

344
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,834
Are you fucking retarded?

345
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,150
All the men are dead.

346
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,915
- Sit down, Andy McNabb.
- Easy, mate. I'm not the enemy.

347
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,469
- Really? See, I think you are.
- Right...

348
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,996
We demand an explanation!

349
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,594
Is it a biological weapon
gone out of control?

350
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,432
It's classified is what it is.

351
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,319
It's hardly classified, mate,
it's running about in stilettos!

352
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,631
- I said sit down.
- Or what? Or what?

353
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,030
Oi! Oi! Oi!

354
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,191
Kettle's boiled.

355
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,234
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Gavin Wright.

356
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,870
We don't give fuck about your rank.
We want an explanation.

357
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,508
- It's virus.
- Why aren't we infected?

358
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,592
I thought you'd worked this one out.
Only women get it.

359
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,228
- Why?
- Just luck.

360
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,755
Oh, that's not funny. Is there a cure?

361
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,559
I don't think anybody
survived long enough to try.

362
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,518
But that's not my department.
I'm just here to shoot them.

363
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,957
- What?
- How did it start?

364
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,315
The only questions you need to ask are,

365
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,074
"How many are there?"
and, "Are they in our way?"

366
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,832
So, how many are there?

367
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,275
The whole village
has gone over to the dark side.

368
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,749
Most of them are out in the woods.

369
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,037
So if you're thinking
of hiking out of here, think again.

370
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,589
What the fuck are they doing
in the woods?

371
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,958
Maybe they're all taking a shit.
Women like to go to the toilet together.

372
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,715
What do you think they're doing?
They're looking for fresh meat.

373
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,029
- So what's your exit plan?
- Same as yours.

374
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,397
Get on the minibus
and fuck off out the way you came in.

375
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,233
Well, there's little problem
with your plan, Marvin.

376
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,076
Bad Candy lives on that bus.
And she's got a little skin complaint.

377
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,111
When she gets off the bus, start running
and don't stop until you hear the horn.

378
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,157
We'll come back and pick you up.

379
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,993
Why are you so sure
she's gonna follow me?

380
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,071
Women love you.

381
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,519
If you have to kill her, just do it.
She's not Candy anymore.

382
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,433
She never was. Her name's Ruth.

383
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,795
- Whatever.
- Well, stop calling her Candy.

384
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,838
Neil, now is not the time
to stop objectifying women.

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,672
Be new man tomorrow.

386
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,675
Today, we need you to be the misogynist
Neanderthal arsehole we know and love.

387
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,276
- You could get this virus next...
- Fuck off.

388
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,396
You even hit like a girl.

389
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,031
- What are you doing?
- Fucking go.

390
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,236
- Liberty-taker.
- Hurry up!

391
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,277
All right, I'm going.

392
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,108
Come on... Come and have a nibble.

393
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,714
You know you want it.

394
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,751
Bollocks.

395
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,113
Get off the...

396
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,352
- Go! Go!
- Quick, hurry up!

397
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,471
Get the phones!

398
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,039
Someone get the phones!

399
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,799
Bastards!

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,115
Fuckin' hell!

401
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,471
Oh, man. We are dog meat.

402
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,600
They're everywhere!

403
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,671
- Shit...
- Oh, man!

404
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,873

405
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,519
Do you know her?

406
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,153
Yeah, yeah...
We had thing once, it didn't end well.

407
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,919
- I'm gonna be sick.
- How do you think I feel?!

408
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,991
The phones...
I've got the fucking phones!

409
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,718
Shit...

410
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,709
- Do something! You're the soldier!
- Look at the fucking size of her!

411
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,232
Oh, no...

412
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,118
Get her off me!

413
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,076
Look out, Vince. Look out!

414
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,598
Fuck! Come on!

415
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,639
Yeah!

416
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,758
Oh, look at your teeth!

Fuckin' hell! Patrick!

418
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,512
- We should start placing bets.
- My money's on that one.

419
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,517
Let's go!

420
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,037
Everyone stay together!

421
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,676
Here, here! Quick, come on.

Weapons, Matt.
Grab any weapons you can.

Not fuckin' robots.

429

All right... I'm looking.

430
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,076
Did you lock that?

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,711
I'm coming!

- Give us a lighter!

438
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,916
Get back. If they can't see us,
they'll forget we're in here.

439
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,753
- That's optimistic, innit?
- They are easily confused.

You had a gun all along?

I was saving the last bullet
for when I needed it.

443

You're still a twat.

444
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,638
Fuck, I think you've just sent out
a party invite.

No.

Don't you know anything?!

- Who's there? Is Neil there?

455
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,790
No, just me, Mikey
and the Milky Bar Kid.

- My name's Gavin.
- Whatever.

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,752
But why don't we
just take this upstairs, eh?

466
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,316
We're both adults.

467
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,437
I'm a man...

468
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,149
You're a...

469
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,557
You're a woman.

470
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,951
This could be the start
of something special - you and me...

471
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,269
All you've gotta do...

472
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,635
is... untie me, yeah?

473
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,475
Just untie me, please.

474
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,556
Come on, then. Come on!

475
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,478
No, no, don't do that. No.

476
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,633
<i>Fear and panic are only
chemicals within your body.</i>

477
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,588
<i>Anxiety is nothing more
than a chemical reaction.</i>

478
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,558
So, what's the plan?

479
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,750
What do you mean what's the plan?

480
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,070
The plan. What's the plan?

481
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,038
- I haven't got one. What's yours?
- I've got a plan.

482
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,158
What's all this bollocks
with the walkie-talkies, then?

483
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,676
Just fancied a chat about
something other than Star Wars.

484
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,956
Oh... How is Matt?

485
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,436
Yeah, the force is with him.

486
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,916
- Oi!
- What?

487
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,593
I said I've got a plan.

488
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,519
Go on, then.

489
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,148
You're the double hard bastard.
You do it.

490
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,197
It's your plan, arsehole.

491
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,396
You two are so gay!

492
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,596
Your mum's an arsehole.

493
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,870
The payload has been delivered.

494
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,519
What?

495
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,830
The head's in the truck, man.
You ready?

496
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,912
We're gonna need a diversion
for our diversion.

497
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,399
I'm on it.

498
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,754
Come and get your meals on wheels.

499
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,152
No!

500
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,639
Fuck off!

501
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,309
Do the horn.

502
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,039
You're not getting the better of me.

503
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,711
Turn it, you're gonna go
out of range!

504
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,110
I'm turning it. I'm turning it!

505
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,396
Get off!

506
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,678
Oh, f... No!

507
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,194
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Fuckin' hell.

508
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,710
Fucking thing!

509
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,198
- How could things get any worse?
- Mikey?

510
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,232
- Yeah?
- Mikey, they've spotted you.

511
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,599
Great.

512
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,510
Yum!

513
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,674
Mikey?

514
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,237
Mikey?

515
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,252
Mikey!

516
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,073
Fuck.

517
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,754
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, wait. Wait.

518
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,798
I am not going out there half-cocked.

519
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,036
Let's party.

520
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,311
Where's mine?

521
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,195
Well, there's only one.

522
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,750
No, look, got a spare.

523
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,079
No?

524
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,030
All right, you can have my backup.

525
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,273
What's this?

526
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,910
I will make you feel sexy.

527
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,353
Yeah!

528
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,230
Right, then. Come on, Vince.
Me and you - Butch and Sundance!

529
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,073
- They both died.
- Yeah!

530
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,834
- Come on, you gimp. Let's go.
- Yeah!

531
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,914
Do your fire thing! Do the fire thing!

532
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,399
Hurry up!

533
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,599
Oh, shit!

534
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,072
Ta.

535
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,639
What do we do now?

536
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,190
We do what everyone else does,
when they're facing mortality.

537
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,032
Run.

538
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,595
Wait, wait.
I bet you a tenner it's locked.

539
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
- Bollocks.
- You owe me tenner.

540
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,316
Oh, my God.

541
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,508
Look, look.

542
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,197
<i>Mikey? Neil? Is anyone there?</i>

543
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,309
- Where's the walkie-talkie?
- Lads, can you hear me?

544
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,075
Me and Matt, we're in the church
but we've lock ed the doors.

545
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,631
So if you get over here, please
just let me know. Try and get over here.

546
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,231
We have to get out of here.

547
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,790
Let's follow your mates over
to the church. It's our best chance.

548
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,872
I think it's a bit late
to start praying, don't you?

549
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,833
You feeling all right, mate?

550
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,389
I have just had a genius idea.

551
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,111
- Is everyone ready?
- You're loving this, aren't you?

552
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,271
- Garry?
- It's Gavin.

553
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,476
Let's just get it over with.

554
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,634
- What?
- You've done this before, haven't you?

555
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,076
- Don't get any funny ideas
- Don't worry, he's not a lesbian.

556
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,755
- Is this gonna work or what?
- Let's try.

557
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,950
Here she is!

558
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,874
Vince, open the church door.

559
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,718
Oh, fuck.

560
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,473
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, come on!

561
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,119
No, no, no! Don't go in there!
Don't go in there!

562
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,957
Wait! That's my 9-iron.

563
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,279
Come on!

564
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,310
- Oh, Christ, it's the ex.
- Vince, we're outside. Open the door.

565
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,914
Don't move, just keep smiling.

566
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,071
Our clothes are in there! Shit!

567
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,437
Oh, for fuck's sake, Julie.
We split up, get over it!

568
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,111
All right, gays... guys!

569
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,829
- Where did you come from?
- I took the scenic route.

570
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,877
Come on.

571
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,991
I hate you. I hate you.

572
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,950
Why don't you just sit on me
and get it over with, you fat fucking pig!

573
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,431
Vince.

574
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,275
- I really wanna go home.
- OK. OK, let's go.

575
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,151
Let's go home.

576
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,956
Vince, are you taking piss?
This isn't funny any more.

577
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,350
- Let us in.
- Hold on, we're coming.

578
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,633
- Come on, hurry up!
- What are they doing?

579
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,633
- What are you doing...
- What the fuck's this?!

580
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,473
- Don't laugh at me!
- Neil! Neil!

581
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,313
- Oi!
- Where the fuck have you been?

582
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,677
(Bad-ass Crazy Lady)

583
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,439
<i># She's dressed to kill
Oh, what a thrill</i>

584
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,591
<i># Mess with her
And you're bound to get ill</i>

585
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,274

586
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,000
- # She'll leave a scar...
- Hello, girls.

587
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,357
- # She knows what she likes...
- Who's first?

588

<i># She looks at me with those crazy eyes</i>

589

597
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,271
Show's over. Everyone get inside.

598
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,352
- I don't think so.
- Is that supposed to frighten me?

599
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,830
- He said it would make me fell sexy.
- Does it?

600
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,956
A little bit, yeah.

601
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,632
Oh, for God's sake!

602
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,678
Can we leave this male posturing
bullshit till later?

603
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,233
Everyone get inside!

604
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,356
I don't think I actually ever used
that finger for anything.

605
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,477
- There's nothing up here.
- Come back, then.

606
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,959
We're nearly there.

607
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,475
Oh, shut up, you girl.

608
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,470
That's it.

609
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,596
Talking of girls...

610
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,638
There's not even a spare
choir-boy outfit up there.

611
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,360
Sit down, silly-bollocks,
you look gorgeous.

612
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:14,038
- I think that butcher took a shine to you.
- Nah, she's not my type, that one.

613
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,838
What about one of the others?

614
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,117
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Don't you ever have a day off?

615
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,193
There were 3 kinky birds
in that house.

616
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,749
For second, I thought, you know...

617
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,629
as long as they don't start
with that sicking-up bollocks...

618
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,189
The one with the, um,
scissors is pretty fit.

619
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,433
She'll have your bollocks for earrings
before you've even bought her a drink.

620
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,239
- I like the one with the axe.
- She's married.

621
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,631
I can't believe this!
You people have no respect for women.

622
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,873
Oh, come on, Graham.
That's why you bat for the other side?

623
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,270
All women are mental.

624
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,752
You can't make that kind of sweeping
generalisation about an entire gender.

625
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,718
Why not? Look at us.

626
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,919
Look at Vince. His glory days are over.
His missus did that to him.

627
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,789
He was king when he met her.
She turned him into a fucking ghost.

628
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,238
We brought him out here to convince
him that all women aren't out to get him.

629
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,197
Yeah, thanks for that, lads.

630
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,590
It's all gone really fuckin' well, innit?

631
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,799
- What are you looking for?
- Yes.

632
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,837
This.

633
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,991
I've done it!

634
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,957
Right.

635
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,997
Wow, we've got the whole village
under surveillance.

636
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,480
Well, it's about time.

637
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,154
You've been offline for nearly 24 hours.

638
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,279
And why was my so-called escort
called back to Moodley last night,

639
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,557
and left me chained
to the fucking briefcase?

640
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,315
That's Meg Nut from the poster, look.

641
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,831
Who are you?

642
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,872
You're not involved
with Project Cat-house.

643
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,156
Where's the Colonel?

644
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,514
- Get her back.
- It's on fire.

645
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,798
It's happening.

646
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,832
- What's happening?
- Phase II.

647
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,675
Hold on a minute. What's Phase I?

648
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,389
Sickness, disorientation, psychosis.

649
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,471
Phase II is the mutation.

650
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,633
They're gonna get smarter,
faster and weirder.

651
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,628
- What's that?
- It's called The Dolphin.

652
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,872
There are high-frequency
sonic deterrents all over the village,

653
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,235
emitting painful sound
only women can hear.

654
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,995
- So there was a fail-safe all along.
- It only works after Phase II.

655
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,277
- Obviously.
- Well, stop talking and press the button.

656
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,796
- Is it working?
- I dunno.

657
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,677
Can YOU hear it?

658
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,316
Um, that doesn't work, does it?

659
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,869
This isn't funny.
They'll be relentless now.

660
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,871
They hunt in packs. We are fucked!

661
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,670
For the sake of clarity, we're not dealing
with few insane women any more.

662
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,070
What you boys
have actually created here

663
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,472
is an army of pissed off,
man-hating, feminist cannibals.

664
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,997
This biological weapon can turn one half
of the population against the other.

665
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,631
- We can fight wars with no armies.
- So this is a test run?

666
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,553
You set the virus loose
in an isolated little village

667
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,790
and then sit and watch it on the telly?

668
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,236
They used to do this kind of thing
in the '50s with LSD.

669
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,597
Thanks, Matthew. What does
Meg Nut have to do with this?

670
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,356
- Not much. She's just a delivery girl.
- Yeah. But delivering WHAT?

671
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,671
How fucking stupid are you people?
What do you think?

672
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,831
A free box of Wundawash?

673
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,239
The virus
is in the washing powder, look.

674
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,913
It's biological.

675
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,278
Everybody, get back.

676
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,789
- Leave her out of it. That's my nan.
- I thought she was on a cruise.

677
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,678
Yeah... So did I.

678
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,476
Matt. Matt, no!

679
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,229
You've, um...

680
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,356
There's some stuff on your face.

681
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,595
All right, Matt?

682
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,076
Thank you.

683
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,360
Don't go in there, Matt.
It's the mortuary.

684
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,351
I think he's traumatised.

685
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,752
I'm the one who's fucking traumatised!
Look what he did to my nan.

686
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,990
Matt? Matt?

687
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,912
Matt...

688
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,358
Vince. Run, run!

689
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,550
What's happened?

690
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,438
Is he all right?

691
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,511
No.

692
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,148
So, where is he, then?

693
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,754
He's dead.

694
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,951
Come on!

695
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,751
That's for Matt...

696
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,796
bitch.

697
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,111
Shit, shit...

698
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,714
- Look at the state of him.
- We can't just leave him here.

699
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,872
What, in mortuary?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

700
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,589
I'm just as freaked out as you are.

701
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,757
What was that?

702
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,637
Vince, don't go down there,
that's how she got in.

703
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,878
Yeah, and it might be our only way out.

704
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,317
- It's the other half of Moodley.
- Jesus, it's all the men.

705
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,278
- You mean parts of them.
- It's a nest.

706
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,791
Come on, come on!

707
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,990
- Get up, come on!
- Get up!

708
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,231
Get up the stairs! Come on!

709
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,236
Vince, Vince! Come on!

710
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,358
- Neil! Neil!
- Close the door!

711
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,192
Neil, give us a hand with this!

712
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,956
Hurry up, will ya?

713
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,474
Oi, what are you pair of tarts
doing up there?

714
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,632
Banksy, what time do you call this?

715
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,314
You would not believe
the shit day I've had.

716
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,156
- What's going on?
- Listen, soft-lad,

717
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,598
outside Mikey's nan's house, there's
a big ladder, go and bring it back here.

718
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,512
What's with the...

719
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,956
- Get the fucking ladder, soppy bollocks.
- Hurry up.

720
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,032
All right, all right,
don't get all aggressive.

721
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,915
Fuck, help me out!

722
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,799
- Get your ass outside.
- I think I'll stay a bit.

723
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,191
Get your ass outside now.
Go, fuck off.

724
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,758
Pat, go on.

725
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,911
- All right?
- Vince?

726
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,991
Hurry up!

727
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,636
I can see your bikini line from here.
What's with the frock?

728
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,040
- What are you doing?
- Vince said a get ladder.

729
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,998
So we can get down, you plank,
not so you can get up.

730
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,799
- What's happening?
- All the women have gone evil.

731
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,430
One of them ate Neil's finger,
Matt killed me nan with a 9-iron

732
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,229
and now he's dead, and we need
to get down the sodding ladder. Down.

733
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,516
You lot been taking drugs?

734
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,677
- You got some left?
- Get down, get down!

735
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,558
Move, move!

736
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,316
Go back up!

737
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,032
We're alive!

738
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,432
Let go!

739
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,232
Who's the monster?

740
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,960
- What are you still doing here?
- Wishing I wasn't.

741
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,959
- Come on!
- Come on, Pat. Come here.

742
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,998
- Come on, Pat.
- Watch his leg!

743
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,638
- Graham, come on, let's go.
- You go.

744
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,268
I'm right behind you.

745
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,398
Fuck me.

746
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,598
Fuckin' hell.

747
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,832
This is worse than
the fucking Pamplona Bull Run.

748
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,271
Fuckin' hell!

749
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,438
Jesus!

750
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,390
- Get the ladder. Get the ladder.
- What's this one?

751
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,792
Come on!

752
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,591
- Come on!
- Vince, Vince...

753
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,199
- Banksy, give us your phone.
- I left it at home.

754
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,669
Right, of course, yeah...

755
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,432
Where are you parked, then?

756
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,239
Behind the big billboard lying
across the street.

757
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,551
What's that?

758
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,632
- It's a rental.
- It's a rental?

759
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,034
What do you mean it's a rental?
Where's your van?

760
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,191
- It broke down, I forgot.
- You forgot?

761
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,715
Repeating everything I say
ain't gonna help, Vince.

762
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,440
What's not gonna help
is that fuckin' moon buggy.

763
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,319
Maybe we can squeeze in.
I'll sit on someone's lap.

764
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,917
Shut up. Forget it, it's too small.
Why did you even get here?

765
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,038
- What are you trying to say?
- This trip was bad a idea.

766
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,031
No... really?

767
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,239
- It could be worse.
- It could be worse?

768
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,710
How many fingers am I holding up?
They're fucking eating us!

769
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,429
- How can it get any worse?
- Can everyone shut the fuck up?

770
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,833
Cracking skulls open with a 9-iron
is not my idea of golfing holiday!

771
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,629
But this is not Mikey's fault,
and it's not Banksy's.

772
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,360
I'm sure as fucking shit,
it's not mine either.

773
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,351
Relax... Relax...

774
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:28,360
Now, we all need to work together
to facilitate some kind of positive -

775
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,593
and I mean POSITIVE escape scenario,
'cause I'm not dying in this shit hole!

776
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,393
<i>There's nothing wrong with you
that can't be fixed with a smile.</i>

777
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,671
Get on the bus.

778
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,918
Come on!

779
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,917
Ruth!

780
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,712
Banksy!

781
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,757
Banksy!

782
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,478
Banksy!

783
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,318
Come on! I've had enough
of standing here!

784
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,472
I'll fuckin stick it in ya!
I'll fucking stick it in ya!

785
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,596
Get in the fucking bus!

786
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,274
I'm fucking sick of it! Fuck!

787
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,356
Come on, Vince, let's go!
Let's go!

788
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,715
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.

789
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,830
What, now? Can't it wait?

790
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,353
No.

791
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,875
Well, it's about fucking time.

792
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,875
Anyone seen me lighter?

793
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,156
Where's me lighter?

794
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,752
Oi, look after it next time, yeah?

795
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,758
You know, I always thought you two
were completely fucking useless.

796
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,310
You - you just follow your dick
like it's a fucking compass.

797
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,359
And you - you're letting your marriage
slip through your fucking fingers.

798
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,829
Neither of you
know anything about women.

799
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,039
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,

800
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,998
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!

801
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:54,036
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.

802
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,589
We try to be what they want us to be.

803
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:03,108
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.

804
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,356
And then what happens?

805
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,512
They get bored -
that's what happens.

806
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:17,790
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?

807
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,833
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,

808
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,753
and roll over, and play dead.

809
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,238
From now on,
what you see is what you get.

810
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,472
For fuck's sake!

811
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,279
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

812
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,433
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

813
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,070
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

814
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,233
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

815
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,790
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

816
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,236
Whoa, easy, easy!

817
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,232
Oh, my God!

818
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,437
What was that?

819
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,556
Fat bird.

820
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,030
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

821
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,756
Hello, hello...

822
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,951
Hello? Is anybody there?

823
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,317
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

824
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,552
In the nest with the stiffs.

825
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,711
Where are you?

826
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,077
Coming to get you, silly twat.

827
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,077
Let's do it.

828
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,236
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

829
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,798
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

830
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,077
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

831
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,268
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

832
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,953
Yeah.

833
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,074
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

834
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,356
Pass one of them golf clubs.

835
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,353
No, give me a wood.

836
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,511
Give him wood as well.

837
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,190
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

838
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,476
But I've got the hump.

839
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,633
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

840
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,872
and... present company
excepted, of course,

841
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,158
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.

842
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,356
Bloody hell, Vince...

843
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,916
not very PC is it?

844
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,749
Come on.

845
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,872
Let's have it!

846
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,192
Now what?

847
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,235
Oi, oi!

848
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,236
You all right?

849
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,031
I've got it working.

850
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,077
Let me see that, let me see that.

851
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,677
Remote-controlled women.

852
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,798
- Do it again, Neil!
- My word!

853
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,199
Take that.

854
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,639
Get in there, Graham.

855
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,751
Be careful, Neil.

856
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,078
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.

857
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,232
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?

858
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,277
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!

859
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,433
Bollocks!

860
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,559
Go!

861
01:21:13,559 --> 01:21:23,559
