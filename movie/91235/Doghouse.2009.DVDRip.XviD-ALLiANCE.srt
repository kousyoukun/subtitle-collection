1
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,860
Fuck...

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,330
Fuckin' hell!

3
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,930
What's the matter with you?
What?

4
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,810
- I'm not a bloody prostitute!
- Alright, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,090
Christ's sake,
this was our second date!

6
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,650
Was it? Listen,
listen, all right...

7
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,920
I was on the tequilas
last night and, um...

8
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,850
- What is your name again?
- You're kidding.

9
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,570
Tell you what,
if you was a prostitute...

10
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,120
you know... you'd be caked.

11
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,930
What's the matter with you?
That was a compliment!

12
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,280
You know what I mean, I can't win!
I've got the pox of it.

13
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,610
Tell you something else,
you're only an old dog, anyway.

14
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,650
Maybe "boys' weekend,"
wasn't the best choice of words.

15
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,410
Whatever. Have a nice time.

16
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,250
I'm not one of those guys who
ditches his mates for his girlfriend!

17
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,170
- I don't want you to ditch your mates!
- What DO you want?

18
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,680
An invite would've been nice.

19
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,840
No girls allowed, darling.

20
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,850
I didn't know
there was gonna be strippers!

21
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,530
- And Neil's not in charge. I am.
- That fills me with confidence.

22
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,330
I'm only going to my gran's.
I'll be back on Monday.

23
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,080
I'll have the locks changed
before then.

24
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,970
Bex, Bex...
It's for Vince. Vince!

25
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,770
He's helped me out
so many times, I've lost count.

26
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,970
When I first came to London,
he supported me. I owe him.

27
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,330
Lots of people get divorced, Mikey.
He'll get over it.

28
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,390
I know he will,

29
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,010
because he's gonna spend a weekend
getting trollied with his mates.

30
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,170
Well, you can celebrate
your own divorce with him then!

31
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,490
I thought you'd react like that,
so I glued your ring on.

32
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,200
- See you Monday, babe. Love you too!
- Mikey, if you walk out that gate...

33
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,960
You don't know whether
you're coming or going, do you?

34
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,440
Patrick!

35
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,770
I'm going. I'm going!

36
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,210
The first weekend
my parents visit in years,

37
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,810
and you bugger off to the wilderness
to rediscover your testicles!

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,090
It's bad enough I have to tell them
you've quit your job...

39
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,890
<i>Welcome to Sonic Stress Therapy.</i>

40

<i>It's going to be a beautiful day.
Let's start it with a smile.</i>

41

42

<i>No, no.</i>

43
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,650
It's a symbol of his identity, and the
source of his primeval inner strength.

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,810
So how come the Zombie Girls
kick his arse on page 4?

45
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,770
How many times have I told you
they're NOT zombies?!

46
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,210
- Alright, calm down. It's only a comic.
- No, no, it's not only a comic.

47
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,810
This is a... It's a unique
and often misunderstood art form.

48
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,370
This... is a painstakingly crafted,

49
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,930
and carefully balanced alignment
of words and art, OK?

50
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,130
- What, like TV?
- Do you want it or not?

51
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,610
- No, it's stupid.
- Right, piss off!

52
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,410
- Go on. We're closing early, OK?
- What? Why?

53
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,450
<i>Spaceltime anomaly.</i>

54
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,810
You mean... you want
a bit of time alone with your missus.

55
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,600
Don't touch her.
Get off her and get out!

56
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,770
Go on, then!

57
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,600
Go on, out!
And don't come back!

58
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,280
Little knob-end.

59
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,250
Vince, you're not getting out of this!

60
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,840
- You're coming with us!
- We're gonna have such a good time!

61
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,680
Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!

62
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, you bastard!

63
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,610
Bastard!

64
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,870
Bastard!

65
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,760
Bastard!

66

69
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,250
<i>¶ The kind I'd hope to see
Hanging on a wall</i>

70
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>¶ Watching me cross the street</i>

71
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,690
<i>¶ I wonder how long it will be</i>

72
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,690
<i>¶ Before I'm sick of her
And I no longer care</i>

<i>¶ Where she goes or has been</i>

74
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,290
<i>¶ Cause she's the new thing</i>

75
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,130
<i>¶ She is the new thing</i>

Thanks.

84
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,450
- Vince, you left this behind, mate.
- Ta.

85
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,330
- I thought you'd given up.
- I have.

86
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,930
- Where's Banksy?
- Late.

87
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,330
He's always late for everything.

88
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,920
He showed up on time for his wedding.

89
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,810
Why's that funny?

90
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,290
Well, he showed up, and...
she didn't show up at all.

91
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,810
Lucky bastard!

92
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,870
Here, I'll give him call.

93
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,840

97
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,610
Hurry up!

98
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,320
Liven yourself up, lazy-bollocks!

99
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,970
Hey, Pat, what's with
them golf clubs, man?

100
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,800
There's no golf courses
where we're going.

101
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,280
That's why have this bag...
my little friend.

102
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,440
You know there's more
to life than football.

- All you need is the open air...
- Me nuts!

104
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,760
I don't think your new-age golf
therapy is gonna work on Vince, Pat.

105
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,960
Vince is real man, Pat, not like you.

106
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,680
You should've seen him
in his glory days, Mikey.

107
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,520
I mean, they used to call him Fearless.

108
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,120
He would step out in front of a
raging bull just to protect his mates,

109
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,000
and still manage to buy the first round
from his hospital bed.

110
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,160
Yeah, that's only 'cause you guys
picked up what was left in me wallet.

111
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,000
- We helped you.
- Go on, show Mikey.

112
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,920
- Oh, yeah, look at this!
- Let's have a look.

113
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,560
Pamplona Bull Run '96. He screamed
like a girl the whole way around.

114
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,720
I wish I was there, man...

115
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,550
Shit!

116
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,880
Sorry, mate, seriously.
Let me just...

117
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,760
Anyway, where were we?

118
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,480
Snap out of it, Vince.

119
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,120
Today you re-discover your inner bloke.
You don't wanna miss it.

120
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,280
Me inner bloke's all right, thanks.

121
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,640
He's not, though, is he?
He's lost his way.

122
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,760
We all have, all suffering
from social gender anxiety.

123
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,880
Is that some sort of disease
or something?

124
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,920
Nobody knows, that's the problem.

125
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,520
The second you try
to figure it out... doomed.

126
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,120
Not you, Vince. We're gonna
bring you back from the brink.

127
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,480
- Oi, no smoking!
- Shut up.

128
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,720
- You're outnumbered.
- I'm terrified!

129
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,640
Slag.

130
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,080
- Charmer...
- Wha'? Wha'?

131
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,840
- Now, listen to me, boys...
- I thought it was funny.

132
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,640
This is the plan.

133
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,360
First thing we do in the country, we
piss up the trees, mark our territory.

134
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,280
Then we're gonna find a pub and drink
till we've forgotten how to speak.

135
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,040
We'll communicate in grunts like
cavemen, till we pass out in the woods.

136
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,160
Any questions?

137
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,080
- Are you Michael? I'm the driver.
- Hey, she's the driver!

138
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,520
Wanna see my driver's license?

139
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,070
That's Mikey,
the little squirt sitting there.

140
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?

141
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,620
I can tell you now it's not "babe".

142
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,440
It's gonna be a long drive, isn't it?

143
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,560
Looks like it's heading that way,
don't it?

144
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,720
I tell you what, let's start again.

145
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,760
- My name's Neil.
- My name's Ruth.

146
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,320
From now on it's Candy.

147
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,920
Ignore him, RUTH. He's a throwback.
He hasn't evolved properly.

148
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,080
Call me Candy.

149
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,560
Come on!

150
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,760
- Right, boys, you ready?
- Yeah!

151
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,480
Get on these 2 here, look.
A couple of right wrong 'uns.

152
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,760
I'll tell you what, women love me.

153
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,760
You got enough petrol, babe,
and all that, yeah?

154
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,920
- Have you called Banksy again?
- He'll show up.

155
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,920
He's like Mikey's missus.
You can't shake him off.

156
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,240
It looks nice,
but it's a piece of shit.

157
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,200
- What?
- It's fucked.

158
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,160
But I've only had it 5 minutes.

159
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,200
Someone's run the knackers off it.
You can't fix that with a nice paint job.

160
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,160
You're the one
who's getting divorced, ain't you?

161
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,960
Thanks for bringing it up.

162
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,880
There's worse things
than getting divorced.

163
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,880
Rape, murder, castration.

164
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,400
Fair enough.

165
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,120
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?

166
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,800
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.

167
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,640
What do you mean weird?

168
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,320
Well, it's just a dead-end
in the middle of the woods.

169
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,360
There's nothing there.

170
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,840
When I saw the booking
I thought it was a wind-up.

171
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,680
Mikey says the women
outnumber the men 4 to 1.

172
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,880
Yes, they do, Neil.

173
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,060
And obviously
they're all gagging for it.

174
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,080
Obviously.

175
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,440
An entire village
full of man-hungry women

176
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,720
waiting to jump the first band
of desperados rolling up from London.

177
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,040
Have you been there, then?

178
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,280
My firm hasn't booked
a job to Moodley in years.

179
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,880
Oh, sod off.

180
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,440
<i>Don't fear. There's no cause for alarm.</i>

181
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,800
All is well.

182
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,760
Death is a natural part of life.

183
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,760
Anxiety about this
is an inbuilt survival reflex,

184
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:58,280
no longer required in this beautiful
predator-free world.

185
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,120
Welcome to the country.

186
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,560
I'll do it, then, shall I?

187
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,320
Yeah, well done.

188
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,360
What's your nana up to
this weekend, Mikey?

189
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,920
She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.

190
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,040
What builders?

191
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,120
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.

192
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,160
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?

193
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,120
- She doesn't know we're coming.
- Well... I did say...

194
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,600
- You fuckin' idiot.
- Listen, man, I know where the key is!

195
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,920
Jesus! This gets better and better.

196
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,320
I might just stay on the minibus
and wait for the return trip.

197
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,360
Gentlemen, you are all past
the point of no return.

198
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,320
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mikey.

199
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,720
It's not me. It's not me!

200
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,320
Hello? Yeah...

201
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,840
I told you I'd sign the papers.

202
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,080
Solicitors always say that.

203
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,250
I can't do nothing today.
I'm not in London.

204
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,640
Moodley... Moodley!

205
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,440
What do you mean it's a shit hole?

206
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,640
Hello? Hello?

207
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,800
Not my PS...

208
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,800
That's it. Give us that fucking thing.
I've had enough of this!

209
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,640
- I'm not having this.
- What are you gonna do?

210
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,840
- All the phones, off, in this bag.
- What?!

211
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,640
- OK? All of you. Come on!
- No, no, no.

212
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,320
Getting away from it all doesn't
include spousal abuse by T-Mobile.

213
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,480
- See you, darling.
- I need to ring my mum.

214
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,360
- You've got mine already.
- In the bag, sunshine.

215
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,280
- Ladies first.
- After you, then.

216
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,800
All right.

217
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,120
Mikey?! Is this it?

218
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,280
- Please tell me you took a wrong turn.
- Told you the place was a dead end.

219
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,000
Is that it? Is this?

220
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,400
Mikey!

221
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,800
We're in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

222
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,160
I'd leave all that, Mikey, till
we've done a bit of reconnaissance.

223
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,920
- We might not be staying.
- What do you mean not staying?

224
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm off the clock for half an hour,
then I'm leaving...

225
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,760
with or without you.

226
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,680
Fiddlesticks!

227
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,960
On your head!

228
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,440
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You idiot!

229
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,110
I'm sure this place used to be bigger
when I was, err... little.

230
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,200
Looks like the whole village
has fucked off with your nan.

231
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,360
Where's all the women, then?

232
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,760
When were you last here, Mikey?

233
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,600
- Well, it's been a few years.
- Right, come on. First things first.

234
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,280
Mikey, you break into your nan's house
and make sure I've got a bed for tonight.

235
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,520
The rest of us can get the beers in
at the... Cock & Bull,

236
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,280
and drink until Moodley
starts looking like Barbados.

237
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,440
And someone
go get Candy down for a drink.

238
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,280
I'll go.

239
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,080
Neil, if she sees you, she's liable
to drive away with our stuff.

240
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,560
What are you talking about?
Women love me.

241
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,080
Really?

242
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,920
You are a long way from
your sports car, though, aren't you?

243
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm gonna go for a slash.
Get us a pint of the usual.

244
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,720
Oh, no, put your money away, Neil.
My shout!

245
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,200
Knob.

246
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,800
"Vote Meg Nut".

247
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,160
Meg Nut... Nut-meg...

248
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,200
"Sponsored by Wundawash".

249
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,600
Oh, shit.

250
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,720
Yes! Yes, yes.

251
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,760
Oh, thank you, gnomie.

252
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,560
Hello?

253
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,920
I can't believe we jumped
on one of Mikey's schemes.

254
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,840
- His heart's in the right place.
- Shame his head is up his arse.

255
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,000
Come on, Pat.
Liven yourself up. Get 'em in.

256
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,520
Neil, Do you see any bar staff?

257
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,360
I think I just saw one in the khazi,
chucking up.

258
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,080
- Maybe they're all sick.
- What the fuck's that horrible stench?

259
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,320
It's the smoking ban, mate.
Get rid of the all the puffers,

260
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,160
you'll find out what a pub really
smells like - stale beer and piss.

261
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,200
No. It's something else.

262
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,560
Where the fuck's Matt?

263
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,960
All right, calm down.
You sound like a dolphin.

264
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,840
Idiot.

265
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,010
Look at that.

266
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,120
It's a knob in a box.

267
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,640
This is a joke, right?

268
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,520
Don't...

269
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,400
Hey, back up. Back up.

270
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,230
I will...

271
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,800
Looks like there is
life on Mars, after all.

272
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,920
- What's the matter with her?
- I think she's homeless.

273
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,520
300 miles from London, the only
person we see is selling the Big Issue.

274
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,040
- Let's get some change.
- I've got some, I've got some.

275
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,000
Hey! Hey!

276
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,360
Go Vince!

277
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,040
- It's not what it looks like, mate!
- Yeah?

278
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,320
Matt, call the police!

279
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,640
Go, Graham. Hit him!

280
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,280
Go on! Somebody else hit him!

281
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,520
Put the knife down, mate.

282
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,560
Put the knife down!

283
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,800
You lot, just listen to me!

284
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,760
- Hey, watch!
- She stabbed me!

285
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,120
All right, hey, hey!

286
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,080
- Oi! Oi!
- What are you doing?!

287
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,080
- Can we talk about this?
- Hang on, hang on.

288
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,640
Jesus...

289
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,960
- What... What's wrong with her?
- What do you mean?

290
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,440
She's like Evil Dead in your shop,
those things with the claws and teeth!

291
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,400
And she's not the only one.

292
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,600
Look! Look at that. Look, look.

293
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,080
- Back on the bus, then, eh?
- Yes, yes!

294
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,040
- What about Action Man?
- Oh, shit.

295
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,800
Come on! Leave him!

296
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,880
Candy, start her up, baby.
We're leaving.

297
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,400
Let's go somewhere else, then.

298
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,760
Yeah, OK.

299
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,760
Where's your nan's house, Mike?

300
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,440
Mike, your nan's house!

301
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
OK...

302
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Let's take the scenic route.

303
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,350
Mikey... Get his gun.

304
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,400
YOU get it.

305
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,400
It's empty.

306
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,200
Oh, mate...

307
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,240
That is not cool...

308
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,990
Look at the state of him.

309
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,160
What?

310
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,160
He said, "Don't go in the woods".

311
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,800
- Why?
- Why you asking me?

312
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,440
What's in the woods?

313
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,510
Everything...
you've ever been afraid of.

314
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,640
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

315
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,240
Quick, quick, Graham!

316
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,360
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm gonna do it when I get the key!

317
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,680
These are multi-combat trousers!
They've got 11 pockets!

318
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,870
You missed her!

319
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,480
Open the fucking door!

320
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
- Vince!
- What?

321
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Help me!

322
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,080
- I've got the key!
- OPEN IT, THEN!

323
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,830
Shut the back door!

324
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,760
Oi, oi!

325
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
They're moving away!

326
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,240
All right, you funny cunts,
how's this supposed to cheer me up?

327
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,520
- Phones are dead.
- "Let's put all the mobiles in a bag".

328
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,680
- Good idea, Neil!
- You wanna talk about this some more?

329
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,440
Let's talk about the unliveable state
of this house we're staying in.

330
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,040
OK, back door's locked, kettle is on.

331
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,120
Neil.

332
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,440
- They're not coming back.
- So what's going on here?

333
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,000
It could be some kind of
chemical spillage.

334
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,600
Maybe one of the streams
has been polluted.

335
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Patrick, when was the last time

336
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,720
you saw pollution turn somebody
into an axe murderer?

337
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,270
Candy didn't even get off the bus
and she still turned into that.

338
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,560
- So it must be in the air.
- Why haven't we got it? And him?

339
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,040
- Maybe only women get it.
- What kinda virus only affects women?

340
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,020
Bird flu.

341
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
So where did all the men go?

342
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,760
No, no, no!

343
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,000
What is it?

344
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,600
Are you fucking retarded?

345
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,920
All the men are dead.

346
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,680
- Sit down, Andy McNabb.
- Easy, mate. I'm not the enemy.

347
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,240
- Really? See, I think you are.
- Right...

348
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,760
We demand an explanation!

349
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,360
Is it a biological weapon
gone out of control?

350
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,200
It's classified is what it is.

351
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,080
It's hardly classified, mate,
it's running about in stilettos!

352
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,840
- I said sit down.
- Or what? Or what?

353
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,230
Oi! Oi! Oi!

354
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Kettle's boiled.

355
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,000
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Gavin Wright.

356
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,640
We don't give fuck about your rank.
We want an explanation.

357
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,280
- It's virus.
- Why aren't we infected?

358
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,360
I thought you'd worked this one out.
Only women get it.

359
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,000
- Why?
- Just luck.

360
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh, that's not funny. Is there a cure?

361
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,320
I don't think anybody
survived long enough to try.

362
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,720
But that's not my department.
I'm just here to shoot them.

363
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
- What?
- How did it start?

364
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,080
The only questions you need to ask are,

365
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,840
"How many are there?"
and, "Are they in our way?"

366
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
So, how many are there?

367
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,040
The whole village
has gone over to the dark side.

368
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,520
Most of them are out in the woods.

369
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,800
So if you're thinking
of hiking out of here, think again.

370
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,360
What the fuck are they doing
in the woods?

371
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,720
Maybe they're all taking a shit.
Women like to go to the toilet together.

372
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,920
What do you think they're doing?
They're looking for fresh meat.

373
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,800
- So what's your exit plan?
- Same as yours.

374
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,160
Get on the minibus
and fuck off out the way you came in.

375
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, there's little problem
with your plan, Marvin.

376
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,280
Bad Candy lives on that bus.
And she's got a little skin complaint.

377
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,880
When she gets off the bus, start running
and don't stop until you hear the horn.

378
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,920
We'll come back and pick you up.

379
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Why are you so sure
she's gonna follow me?

380
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,280
Women love you.

381
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,720
If you have to kill her, just do it.
She's not Candy anymore.

382
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,200
She never was. Her name's Ruth.

383
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,560
- Whatever.
- Well, stop calling her Candy.

384
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,600
Neil, now is not the time
to stop objectifying women.

385
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,440
Be new man tomorrow.

386
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Today, we need you to be the misogynist
Neanderthal arsehole we know and love.

387
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,040
- You could get this virus next...
- Fuck off.

388
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,600
You even hit like a girl.

389
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
- What are you doing?
- Fucking go.

390
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,000
- Liberty-taker.
- Hurry up!

391
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,480
All right, I'm going.

392
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,880
Come on... Come and have a nibble.

393
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,920
You know you want it.

394
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,960
Bollocks.

395
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
Get off the...

396
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,560
- Go! Go!
- Quick, hurry up!

397
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,240
Get the phones!

398
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Someone get the phones!

399
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,000
Bastards!

400
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,320
Fuckin' hell!

401
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,680
Oh, man. We are dog meat.

402
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,360
They're everywhere!

403
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,880
- Shit...
- Oh, man!

404
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
Julie?

405
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,720
Do you know her?

406
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,360
Yeah, yeah...
We had thing once, it didn't end well.

407
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,120
- I'm gonna be sick.
- How do you think I feel?!

408
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,760
The phones...
I've got the fucking phones!

409
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,920
Shit...

410
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,910
- Do something! You're the soldier!
- Look at the fucking size of her!

411
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,440
Oh, no...

412
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,320
Get her off me!

413
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,280
Look out, Vince. Look out!

414
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,800
Fuck! Come on!

415
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Yeah!

416
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,960
Oh, look at your teeth!

417
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,320
Fuckin' hell! Patrick!

418
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,720
- We should start placing bets.
- My money's on that one.

419
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,720
Let's go!

420
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,240
Everyone stay together!

421
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,880
Here, here! Quick, come on.

422

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,560
Weapons, Matt.
Grab any weapons you can.

428
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,040
Not fuckin' robots.

429
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,680
All right... I'm looking.

430
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,280
Did you lock that?

431
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,840

00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,120
Where are you going? Matt!

433
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,920
I'm coming!

- Give us a lighter!

THE OTHER POCKET!

438
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,680
Get back. If they can't see us,
they'll forget we're in here.

439
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,960
- That's optimistic, innit?
- They are easily confused.

you fucking monkey's arse-ring.

I was saving the last bullet
for when I needed it.

443

You're still a twat.

444
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,840
Fuck, I think you've just sent out
a party invite.

No.

- Who's there? Is Neil there?

455
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,560
No, just me, Mikey
and the Milky Bar Kid.

456
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,520
- My name's Gavin.
- Whatever.

he's probably halfway home.

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,520
We're both adults.

467
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
I'm a man...

468
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,350
You're a...

469
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,760
You're a woman.

470
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,150
This could be the start
of something special - you and me...

471
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,470
All you've gotta do...

472
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,840
is... untie me, yeah?

473
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,680
Just untie me, please.

474
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,760
Come on, then. Come on!

475
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,680
No, no, don't do that. No.

476
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,400
<i>Fear and panic are only
chemicals within your body.</i>

477
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,360
<i>Anxiety is nothing more
than a chemical reaction.</i>

478
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,760
So, what's the plan?

479
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,520
What do you mean what's the plan?

480
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,840
The plan. What's the plan?

481
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,800
- I haven't got one. What's yours?
- I've got a plan.

482
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,920
What's all this bollocks
with the walkie-talkies, then?

483
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,440
Just fancied a chat about
something other than Star Wars.

484
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,160
Oh... How is Matt?

485
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,640
Yeah, the force is with him.

486
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,680
- Oi!
- What?

487
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,800
I said I've got a plan.

488
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,280
Go on, then.

489
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,920
You're the double hard bastard.
You do it.

490
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,960
It's your plan, arsehole.

491
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,600
You two are so gay!

492
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,800
Your mum's an arsehole.

493
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,640
The payload has been delivered.

494
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,280
What?

495
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,030
The head's in the truck, man.
You ready?

496
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,680
We're gonna need a diversion
for our diversion.

497
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,600
I'm on it.

498
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,960
Come and get your meals on wheels.

499
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,360
No!

500
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Fuck off!

501
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,510
Do the horn.

502
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,240
You're not getting the better of me.

503
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,480
Turn it, you're gonna go
out of range!

504
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,880
I'm turning it. I'm turning it!

505
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,600
Get off!

506
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,880
Oh, f... No!

507
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,400
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Fuckin' hell.

508
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,910
Fucking thing!

509
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,400
- How could things get any worse?
- Mikey?

510
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,440
- Yeah?
- Mikey, they've spotted you.

511
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,800
Great.

512
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,710
Yum!

513
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,400
Mikey?

514
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,320
Mikey!

515
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,840
Fuck.

516
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,520
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, wait. Wait.

517
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,000
I am not going out there half-cocked.

518
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,240
Let's party.

519
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,510
Where's mine?

520
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,400
Well, there's only one.

521
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,950
No, look, got a spare.

522
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,280
No?

523
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,230
All right, you can have my backup.

524
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,480
What's this?

525
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,110
I will make you feel sexy.

526
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
Yeah!

527
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,000
Right, then. Come on, Vince.
Me and you - Butch and Sundance!

528
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,840
- They both died.
- Yeah!

529
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,040
- Come on, you gimp. Let's go.
- Yeah!

530
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,680
Do your fire thing! Do the fire thing!

531
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,600
Hurry up!

532
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Oh, shit!

533
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,280
Ta.

534
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,400
What do we do now?

535
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,960
We do what everyone else does,
when they're facing mortality.

536
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,240
Run.

537
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,800
Wait, wait.
I bet you a tenner it's locked.

538
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,480
- Bollocks.
- You owe me tenner.

539
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,520
Oh, my God.

540
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,710
Look, look.

541
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,960
<i>Mikey? Neil? Is anyone there?</i>

542
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,080
- Where's the walkie-talkie?
- Lads, can you hear me?

543
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,840
Me and Matt, we're in the church
but we've lock ed the doors.

544
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,830
So if you get over here, please just
let me know. Try and get over here.

545
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,000
We have to get out of here.

546
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,560
Let's follow your mates over
to the church. It's our best chance.

547
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,080
I think it's a bit late
to start praying, don't you?

548
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,600
You feeling all right, mate?

549
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,160
I have just had a genius idea.

550
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,880
- Is everyone ready?
- You're loving this, aren't you?

551
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,040
- Garry?
- It's Gavin.

552
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,680
Let's just get it over with.

553
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,400
- What?
- You've done this before, haven't you?

554
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,840
- Don't get any funny ideas
- Don't worry, he's not a lesbian.

555
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,960
- Is this gonna work or what?
- Let's try.

556
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,150
Here she is!

557
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,080
Vince, open the church door.

558
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,920
Oh, fuck.

559
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,680
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, come on!

560
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,320
No, no, no! Don't go in there!
Don't go in there!

561
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,160
Wait! That's my 9-iron.

562
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Come on!

563
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,510
- Oh, Christ, it's the ex.
- Vince, we're outside. Open the door.

564
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,120
Don't move, just keep smiling.

565
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,270
Our clothes are in there! Shit!

566
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,640
Oh, for fuck's sake, Julie.
We split up, get over it!

567
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,310
All right, gays... guys!

568
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,030
- Where did you come from?
- I took the scenic route.

569
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,080
Come on.

570
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,190
I hate you. I hate you.

571
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,150
Why don't you just sit on me and
get it over with, you fat fucking pig!

572
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,200
Vince.

573
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,480
- I really wanna go home.
- OK. OK, let's go.

574
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,350
Let's go home.

575
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,720
Vince, are you taking piss?
This isn't funny any more.

576
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,550
- Let us in.
- Hold on, we're coming.

577
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,400
- Come on, hurry up!
- What are they doing?

578
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,800
- What are you doing...
- What the fuck's this?!

579
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,240
- Don't laugh at me!
- Neil! Neil!

580
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,080
- Oi!
- Where the fuck have you been?

581
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,880
(Bad-ass Crazy Lady)

582
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,200
<i>¶ She's dressed to kill
Oh, what a thrill</i>

583
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,360
<i>¶ Mess with her
And you're bound to get ill</i>

584
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,040
<i>¶ She'll chew you up
and spit you out</i>

585
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,760
- ¶ She'll leave a scar...
- Hello, girls.

586
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,120
- ¶ She knows what she likes...
- Who's first?

587
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,960
<i>¶ She looks at me
with those crazy eyes</i>

588
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,240
<i>¶ Takes no time for me
to realise</i>

589
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,600
<i>¶ She's a wild-eyed crazy lady</i>

590
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:52,470
<i>¶ Bad-ass crazy lady</i>

591
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,160
<i>¶ Wild-eyed crazy lady</i>

592
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,280
<i>¶ Bad-ass crazy lady</i>

593
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,720
- ¶ Wild-eyed crazy lady... ¶
- I'll call you.

594
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,040
Show's over. Everyone get inside.

595
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,120
- I don't think so.
- Is that supposed to frighten me?

596
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,600
- He said it would make me fell sexy.
- Does it?

597
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,160
A little bit, yeah.

598
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,400
Oh, for God's sake!

599
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,880
Can we leave this male posturing
bullshit till later?

600
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,440
Everyone get inside!

601
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,560
I don't think I actually ever used
that finger for anything.

602
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,240
- There's nothing up here.
- Come back, then.

603
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,160
We're nearly there.

604
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,680
Oh, shut up, you girl.

605
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,240
That's it.

606
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,360
Talking of girls...

607
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,400
There's not even a spare
choir-boy outfit up there.

608
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,120
Sit down, silly-bollocks,
you look gorgeous.

609
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,170
I think that butcher
took a shine to you.

610
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,800
Nah, she's not my type, that one.

611
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,600
What about one of the others?

612
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,880
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Don't you ever have a day off?

613
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,960
There were 3 kinky birds
in that house.

614
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,520
For second, I thought, you know...

615
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,400
as long as they don't start
with that sicking-up bollocks...

616
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,960
The one with the, um,
scissors is pretty fit.

617
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,200
She'll have your bollocks for earrings
before you've even bought her a drink.

618
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,000
- I like the one with the axe.
- She's married.

619
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,400
I can't believe this!
You people have no respect for women.

620
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,640
Oh, come on, Graham.
That's why you bat for the other side?

621
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,040
All women are mental.

622
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,520
You can't make that kind of sweeping
generalisation about an entire gender.

623
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,480
Why not? Look at us.

624
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,680
Look at Vince. His glory days are over.
His missus did that to him.

625
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,560
He was king when he met her.
She turned him into a fucking ghost.

626
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,000
We brought him out here to convince
him that all women aren't out to get him.

627
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,960
Yeah, thanks for that, lads.

628
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,790
It's all gone really fuckin' well,
innit?

629
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,560
- What are you looking for?
- Yes.

630
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,600
This.

631
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,760
I've done it!

632
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,160
Right.

633
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,200
Wow, we've got the whole village
under surveillance.

634
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,240
Well, it's about time.

635
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,920
You've been offline
for nearly 24 hours.

636
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,040
And why was my so-called escort
called back to Moodley last night,

637
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,320
and left me chained
to the fucking briefcase?

638
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,520
That's Meg Nut from the poster, look.

639
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,030
Who are you?

640
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,640
You're not involved
with Project Cat-house.

641
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,360
Where's the Colonel?

642
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,720
- Get her back.
- It's on fire.

643
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,000
It's happening.

644
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,600
- What's happening?
- Phase II.

645
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,440
Hold on a minute. What's Phase I?

646
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,160
Sickness, disorientation, psychosis.

647
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,240
Phase II is the mutation.

648
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,840
They're gonna get smarter,
faster and weirder.

649
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,400
- What's that?
- It's called The Dolphin.

650
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,640
There are high-frequency sonic
deterrents all over the village,

651
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,000
emitting painful sound
only women can hear.

652
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,760
- So there was a fail-safe all along.
- It only works after Phase II.

653
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,180
Obviously.

654
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,480
Well, stop talking
and press the button.

655
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,000
- Is it working?
- I dunno.

656
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,880
Can YOU hear it?

657
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,080
Um, that doesn't work, does it?

658
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,640
This isn't funny.
They'll be relentless now.

659
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
They hunt in packs.
We are fucked!

660
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
For the sake of clarity,

661
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,440
we're not dealing with
a few insane women any more.

662
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,840
What you boys
have actually created here...

663
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:03,240
is an army of pissed off,
man-hating, feminist cannibals.

664
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,590
This biological weapon can turn
one half of the population...

665
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:07,760
against the other.

666
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,400
- We can fight wars with no armies.
- So this is a test run?

667
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,320
You set the virus loose
in an isolated little village

668
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,560
and then sit and watch it on the telly?

669
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,000
They used to do this kind of thing
in the '50s with LSD.

670
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,360
Thanks, Matthew. What does
Meg Nut have to do with this?

671
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,120
- Not much. She's just a delivery girl.
- Yeah. But delivering WHAT?

672
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,440
How fucking stupid are you people?
What do you think?

673
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,030
A free box of Wundawash?

674
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,000
The virus
is in the washing powder, look.

675
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,120
It's biological.

676
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,480
Everybody, get back.

677
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,560
- Leave her out of it. That's my nan.
- I thought she was on a cruise.

678
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,880
Yeah... So did I.

679
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,680
Matt. Matt, no!

680
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,430
You've, um...

681
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,560
There's some stuff on your face.

682
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,800
All right, Matt?

683
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,280
Thank you.

684
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,120
Don't go in there, Matt.
It's the mortuary.

685
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,120
I think he's traumatised.

686
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,520
I'm the one who's fucking traumatised!
Look what he did to my nan.

687
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,190
Matt? Matt?

688
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,110
Matt...

689
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,560
Vince. Run, run!

690
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,320
What's happened?

691
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,200
Is he all right?

692
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,710
No.

693
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,920
So, where is he, then?

694
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,960
He's dead.

695
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,150
Come on!

696
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,950
That's for Matt...

697
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,000
bitch.

698
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,310
Shit, shit...

699
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,480
- Look at the state of him.
- We can't just leave him here.

700
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,070
What, in mortuary?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

701
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,790
I'm just as freaked out as you are.

702
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,960
What was that?

703
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,840
Vince, don't go down there,
that's how she got in.

704
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,080
Yeah, and it might be our only way out.

705
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:28,080
- It's the other half of Moodley.
- Jesus, it's all the men.

706
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,480
- You mean parts of them.
- It's a nest.

707
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,990
Come on, come on!

708
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,190
- Get up, come on!
- Get up!

709
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,430
Get up the stairs! Come on!

710
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,000
Vince, Vince! Come on!

711
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,560
- Neil! Neil!
- Close the door!

712
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,390
Neil, give us a hand with this!

713
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,160
Hurry up, will ya?

714
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,240
Oi, what are you pair of tarts
doing up there?

715
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,400
Banksy, what time do you call this?

716
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,520
You would not believe
the shit day I've had.

717
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,920
- What's going on?
- Listen, soft-lad,

718
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,360
outside Mikey's nan's house, there's a
big ladder, go and bring it back here.

719
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,280
What's with the...

720
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,720
- Get the fucking ladder, soppy bollocks.
- Hurry up.

721
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,230
All right, all right,
don't get all aggressive.

722
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,680
Fuck, help me out!

723
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,560
- Get your ass outside.
- I think I'll stay a bit.

724
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,390
Get your ass outside now.
Go, fuck off.

725
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,520
Pat, go on.

726
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,680
- All right?
- Vince?

727
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,190
Hurry up!

728
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,840
I can see your bikini line from here.
What's with the frock?

729
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,800
- What are you doing?
- Vince said a get ladder.

730
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,760
So we can get down, you plank,
not so you can get up.

731
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,560
- What's happening?
- All the women have gone evil.

732
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,200
One of them ate Neil's finger,
Matt killed me nan with a 9-iron

733
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,000
and now he's dead, and we need
to get down the sodding ladder. Down.

734
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,720
You lot been taking drugs?

735
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,440
- You got some left?
- Get down, get down!

736
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,760
Move, move!

737
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,520
Go back up!

738
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,230
We're alive!

739
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,630
Let go!

740
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,000
Who's the monster?

741
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,160
- What are you still doing here?
- Wishing I wasn't.

742
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,720
- Come on!
- Come on, Pat. Come here.

743
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,200
- Come on, Pat.
- Watch his leg!

744
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,400
- Graham, come on, let's go.
- You go.

745
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,470
I'm right behind you.

746
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,600
Fuck me.

747
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,800
Fuckin' hell.

748
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,030
This is worse than
the fucking Pamplona Bull Run.

749
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,470
Fuckin' hell!

750
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,640
Jesus!

751
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,590
- Get the ladder. Get the ladder.
- What's this one?

752
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,990
Come on!

753
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,790
- Come on!
- Vince, Vince...

754
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,960
- Banksy, give us your phone.
- I left it at home.

755
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,440
Right, of course, yeah...

756
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,200
Where are you parked, then?

757
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,440
Behind the big billboard lying
across the street.

758
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,320
What's that?

759
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,830
- It's a rental.
- It's a rental?

760
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,800
What do you mean it's a rental?
Where's your van?

761
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,960
- It broke down, I forgot.
- You forgot?

762
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,480
Repeating everything I say
ain't gonna help, Vince.

763
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,200
What's not gonna help
is that fuckin' moon buggy.

764
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,080
Maybe we can squeeze in.
I'll sit on someone's lap.

765
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,680
Shut up. Forget it, it's too small.
Why did you even get here?

766
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,800
- What are you trying to say?
- This trip was bad a idea.

767
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,800
No... really?

768
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,000
- It could be worse.
- It could be worse?

769
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,480
How many fingers am I holding up?
They're fucking eating us!

770
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,200
- How can it get any worse?
- Can everyone shut the fuck up?

771
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,600
Cracking skulls open with a 9-iron
is not my idea of golfing holiday!

772
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,400
But this is not Mikey's fault,
and it's not Banksy's.

773
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,560
I'm sure as fucking shit,
it's not mine either.

774
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,550
Relax... Relax...

775
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,120
Now, we all need to work together
to facilitate some kind of positive -

776
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,800
and I mean POSITIVE escape scenario,
'cause I'm not dying in this shit hole!

777
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,600
<i>There's nothing wrong with you
that can't be fixed with a smile.</i>

778
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,870
Get on the bus.

779
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,120
Come on!

780
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,120
Ruth!

781
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,960
Banksy!

782
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,680
Banksy!

783
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,080
Come on! I've had enough
of standing here!

784
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,240
I'll fuckin stick it in ya!
I'll fucking stick it in ya!

785
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,360
Get in the fucking bus!

786
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,480
I'm fucking sick of it! Fuck!

787
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,560
Come on, Vince, let's go!
Let's go!

788
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,920
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.

789
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,600
What, now? Can't it wait?

790
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,120
No.

791
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,080
Well, it's about fucking time.

792
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,640
Anyone seen me lighter?

793
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,360
Where's me lighter?

794
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,950
Oi, look after it next time, yeah?

795
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,520
You know, I always thought you two
were completely fucking useless.

796
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,080
You - you just follow your dick
like it's a fucking compass.

797
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,120
And you - you're letting your marriage
slip through your fucking fingers.

798
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,600
Neither of you
know anything about women.

799
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,800
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,

800
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,200
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!

801
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,800
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.

802
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,360
We try to be what they want us to be.

803
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:58,310
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.

804
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,120
And then what happens?

805
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,710
They get bored -
that's what happens.

806
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,990
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?

807
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,600
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,

808
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,950
and roll over, and play dead.

809
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,440
From now on,
what you see is what you get.

810
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,240
For fuck's sake!

811
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,040
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

812
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:47,200
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

813
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,840
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

814
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,430
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

815
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,990
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

816
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,440
Whoa, easy, easy!

817
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,430
Oh, my God!

818
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,200
What was that?

819
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,760
Fat bird.

820
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,230
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

821
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,960
Hello, hello...

822
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,720
Hello? Is anybody there?

823
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,080
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

824
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,320
In the nest with the stiffs.

825
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,910
Where are you?

826
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,280
Coming to get you, silly twat.

827
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,280
Let's do it.

828
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,440
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

829
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,560
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

830
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,840
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

831
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:55,040
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

832
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,840
Yeah.

833
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,840
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

834
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,120
Pass one of them golf clubs.

835
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,120
No, give me a wood.

836
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,710
Give him wood as well.

837
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,960
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

838
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,240
But I've got the hump.

839
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,400
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

840
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,640
and... present company
excepted, of course,

841
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,920
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.

842
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,560
Bloody hell, Vince...

843
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,120
not very PC is it?

844
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,950
Come on.

845
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,070
Let's have it!

846
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,390
Now what?

847
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,440
Oi, oi!

848
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,440
You all right?

849
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,800
I've got it working.

850
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,280
Let me see that, let me see that.

851
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,440
Remote-controlled women.

852
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,000
- Do it again, Neil!
- My word!

853
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,400
Take that.

854
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,840
Get in there, Graham.

855
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,950
Be careful, Neil.

856
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,840
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.

857
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,430
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?

858
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,040
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!

859
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,630
Bollocks!

860
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,760
Go!
