A Lot Like Christmas" playing]

00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,878
[inflatable deflating][song distorts, slow]

5
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:59,972
[father]
I can'’t just manifest
a tree topper.

6
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:03,237
[mother] Okay. Okay.
You don'’t need to give every
example of what you can'’t do.

7
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:04,934
[father]
Why is this stuff so important?

8
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,414
[mother] Because!

9
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,198
It'’s been a hard year.

10
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,766
The move, a new school.

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,638
I mean, God, I just want it
to be special for Liam.

12
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:18,339
[father sighs]
I get it. I just don'’t know
where the tree topper is, okay?

13
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:22,256
I can'’t magically make a box
with a-a star appear.

14
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,910
And for the tenth time,
it'’s not a star,
it'’s an angel.

15
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,043
- Oh, an angel.
- Yes, it'’s an angel.

16
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,740
- Okay.
- And every year,

17
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,655
it sits
on top of the tree, okay?

18
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,397
And it looks down upon us
like it'’s a guardian angel.

19
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,878
Oh. [scoffs]
- A guardian angel.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,185
Well, maybe
we need a new one anyway.

21
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,665
The old one wasn'’t doing
that great of a job, was it?

22
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,712
Wow.

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,903
Okay, so it'’s just vanished.
It'’s completely gone.[sighs]

24
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,383
Missing in action.

25
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:05,125
For once in your life,
can you just let it go?

26
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,430
- Yeah.
- For once?

27
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,215
- Can you do that?
- Yes, I can

28
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,347
when you admit
that you screwed up, okay?
How about that?

29
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,481
Oh, I get it.
As long as I take the blame
for every little thing that ha--

30
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,656
Hey, guys.

31
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,442
Wow! It looks amazing in here.

32
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,792
Thank you, honey.
Thank you.

33
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,229
I was just looking for...
[sniffles]

34
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,100
...for the tree topper
that your father lost,

35
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,537
and I just got a little bit
- of tinsel in my eye.
- Unbelievable.

36
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,409
But I'’m not crying,
because everything is great.

37
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,324
We'’re gonna have
a great Christmas.
[sniffles]

38
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,761
Tree toppers?
Come on, Mom.

39
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:37,461
Christmas isn'’t about
tree toppers and ornaments
and all that stupid stuff.

40
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:42,292
It'’s about togetherness
and music and...

41
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,252
Hey, guess what
I was doing upstairs.

42
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:46,514
What were you
doing upstairs?

43
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,255
Writing my letter to Santa.

44
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,126
- Really? You were?
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,780
Letter to Santa?

46
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,348
Aren'’t you getting
a little too old for that?

47
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:58,917
Oh, no, no.
What-What your dad means
is just that sometimes,

48
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,139
Santa is too busy responding
to letters
from all of the little kids

49
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,968
that then he doesn'’t always
have the time to respond to
the letters

50
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,317
from the big kids too.

51
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,450
No, that'’s not at all
what I meant.

52
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,886
Bill, just...

53
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:13,671
I'’ve always written
letters to Santa.

54
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,717
How else will he know
what I want for Christmas?

55
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,414
Exactly, honey.

56
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,373
I think
it'’s absolutely wonderful.

57
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,896
Not all of us are a scrooge.

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,768
No, I--
I'’m not a scrooge.

59
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,074
I just...

60
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:30,862
Look, I know how hard it is
being the new kid in town.

61
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:34,431
And as it is, school presents
challenges for you
because of your learning dis--

62
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:35,737
Differences.

63
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,305
Learning differences.

64
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,785
[Bill]
Right, learning differences.

65
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,660
Which is good,
but even more reason
not to write certain letters.

66
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,010
Because that way,
when you go to meet
other sixth-graders

67
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:49,098
and try to make friends,

68
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,665
you won'’t get, uh...

69
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:53,276
beaten up.

70
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,756
[sighs]

71
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,455
What are you saying?
I have a friend-- friends.

72
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,805
Really?
Well, I didn'’t know that.

73
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,417
Mom, I'’ve been at that school
for, like, three months.

74
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,766
Why wouldn'’t I have friends?

75
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,377
Just because of
social distancing.

76
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,467
Come on, Mom.
That ended two years ago.

77
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,600
And I do have friends.

78
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,472
My friend Gibby'’s
about one of
the most popular kids in school.

79
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,648
We play football at recess
and everything.
[chuckles]

80
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:18,823
Play football?

81
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,173
Yeah.

82
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,566
That'’s what I just said.

83
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,438
Nice.

84
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:25,526
[mother] Gibby!

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,614
Ow.

86
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,704
Gibby! Gibby!

87
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,359
I'’m so proud of you.

88
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,317
Why'’d you tell them
we play football?

89
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:35,927
We don'’t even have
a football team.

90
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,929
We'’re 11.

91
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,542
I didn'’t say we were on a team.
I just said we played at recess.

92
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,457
What kind of football
do we play?

93
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:48,244
[blows raspberry]
Flag football, I guess.

94
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,551
Plus, they'’re not gonna
waterboard us about this.

95
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,030
You don'’t know that.

96
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,032
Parents can be weird.
They like to know stuff.

97
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,731
What position
should I say I play?

98
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,082
You'’re the kicker.

99
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,868
Am I like the guy
who kicks it real high

100
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:07,263
or the guy who tries to
get the ball
through the things?

101
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:10,222
The field goal kicker.

102
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:13,313
Okay, cool. You know the game,
so we won'’t get tripped up.

103
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,577
Oh, and one more thing.

104
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,928
I also told them
you have cancer.

105
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:21,843
What? Why?

106
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,715
My parents know
I don'’t make friends easily,

107
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,153
so to make it real,

108
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,591
I told them I was nice
to a kid with cancer

109
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,375
and he was nice to me back.

110
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,421
But we are friends.

111
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,466
Why'’d you have to
make anything up?

112
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,296
[sighs]
Hindsight is twenty-twenty.

113
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:47,347
The point is,
if you meet my parents,

114
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,784
just make sure
you act a little cancer-y.

115
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,568
Will do.

116
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,442
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,226
Hold your horses, hotshot.

118
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,141
What do you think you'’re doing?

119
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,925
Um, crossing the street?

120
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,363
I'’ll tell you
when you can cross the street.

121
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,408
But there are no cars.

122
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,584
[gasps] When did you finish

123
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:11,066
your two-hour
crossing guard
certification course?

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,459
I didn'’t.

125
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,417
Oh, that'’s right.

126
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,897
That was me.

127
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,769
So I'’ll tell you
when there are no cars.

128
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,781
Go. Go ahead.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,567
Mr. "I'’m In A Hurry At First."

130
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,004
Where'’d he go? Bring him back.

131
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:37,962
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello.

132
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,790
- Hi.
- Hello.

133
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,488
[bell ringing][sighs]

134
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,927
There she is.

136
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,714
[chattering]

137
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,863
Legit question.

138
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,083
Why are you staring
at someone you cannot get?

139
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,435
What, Emma?
We have a ton in common.

140
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,610
Like?

141
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,787
We both like cats.

142
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,353
That'’s a ton?

143
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,617
We can build off that.

144
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,662
What'’s so great
about her anyway?

145
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,403
You only like her
'’cause she'’s pretty.

146
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,231
What? No.

147
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,582
I like her
'’cause whenever I look at her,
she smiles.

148
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,672
Big deal. Smiling'’s easy
when you have nice teeth.

149
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,848
And she'’s kind.

150
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,894
People that pretty
are usually mean.

151
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:41,635
Yeah, I guess.

152
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,593
She does have a lot of friends.

153
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,424
Pray for me.

154
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,861
No. Liam. Get-- Abort!

155
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:53,473

[stammers]

157
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,350
I like the cat stickers
on your locker.

158
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,743
Thank you.

159
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,919
My cat licks her nipples.

160
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,139
Well, that'’s pretty random.

161
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,054
[chuckles]
Yeah, that was pretty random.

162
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,230
Um, by the way,
do you like Post Malone?

163
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,797
Love him.

164
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,843
Don'’t you remember
when Mr. Charles asked me

165
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:19,063
to name
my favorite piece of writing,
and I said "Congratulations"?

166
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:23,981
Yeah. Well, he'’s in town
doing a concert.
Maybe we could--

167
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,156
What'’s up, E?

168
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,157
Hey, Aiden.

169
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,855
- How are you?
- Good.

170
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,771
- [Aiden] Whoa.
- Uh...

171
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,207
What do you think you'’re doing?

172
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,339
Oh, nothing really.
I was actually just...

173
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,993
You trying to hit on my girl?

174
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,560
Aiden, stop that.

175
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,824
- Well, were you?
- No, no, no, no.

176
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:44,785
No. No. I was just trying to
tell her about my cat'’s nipples.

177
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,439
Your cat'’s nipple--
Bro, what are you talking about?

178
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:49,485
And other stuff.

179
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,706
Uh, tootles.

180
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,055
Uh...

181
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:57,754
I never say tootles,
just FYI.

182
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,148
That was my first time.

183
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,411
Okay.

184
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,457
Darn it!

185
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,113
How'’d it go?

186
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,161
I might have to
change schools again.

187
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:18,427
My pupils,
focus your pupils on me

188
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,735
as I mold your malleable minds.

189
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:26,174
As I massage the clay
that is your cerebellum.

190
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:31,309
Today, my friends,
we discuss <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

191
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:35,662
Perhaps the most overrated
of Charles Dickens'’s books.

192
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:40,362
And I must say, it certainly
missed my "great expectations."
[chuckles]

193
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,233
Now, when I read the book,

194
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,715
I felt like I was being visited
by the ghost of Christmas past.

195
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,325
Hard pass for me.

196
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,460
Liam.

197
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,071
I'’d be curious why you find
the young lady'’s hair

198
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,421
more captivating
than my lecture.

199
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,337
No, I wasn'’t--
I wasn'’t staring
at Emma'’s shiny hair.

200
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,774
Oh?[students chuckle]

201
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:05,126
Then what part of her
were you staring at?

202
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,608
- Arm.
- Arm.

203
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,087
[students laugh]

204
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,741
But I was also listening to you.

205
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:15,005
Is that right?
So you'’re able to ogle her arm

206
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,051
and listen to me
at the same time?

207
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,530
Yeah, it'’s--
it'’s not that hard.

208
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:19,880
[students laugh]

209
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,970
Now, Liam,
if you'’re so hyperaware,

210
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:26,147
maybe you can tell me
what book I am discussing.

211
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,152
"Carol'’s Christmas"?

212
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,284
[students laugh]

213
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,851
Gotcha.

214
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,679
Now pay attention.

215
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,334
Demerit.

216
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,944
[student]
"Carol'’s Christmas."

217
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,512
Written by the great author,
Dickens Charles.

218
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,036
[students laugh]

219
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,257
Hey! You don'’t make fun of
dyslexia. Not cool.

220
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,914
Oh, and by the way,
Einstein had dyslexia too.

221
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,524
The bagel guy?

222
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,005
No. No, the other one.

223
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,401
[Liam] <i>You see the way
Emma stood up for me?</i>

224
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,360
Maybe she likes me too.

225
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:10,539
Liam, you'’re right
about Emma being awesome.

226
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:14,804
But she'’s not gonna be
interested in you unless
you pull it together, man.

227
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,458
Attempt to be cool.

228
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:18,503
[sighs] Maybe you'’re right.

229
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,377
All right, I gotta go.
I gotta mail a letter to Santa.

230
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,901
What?
Letter to Santa?

231
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:28,513
This is exactly
the kind of crap
I'’m talking about.

232
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,125
What are you doing
writing letters to Santa?

233
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,692
[sighs]

234
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:36,130
Look, I know.
I know he'’s probably not real.

235
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,393
But let'’s just say
there'’s, like,
a 1% chance he is

236
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,221
and there'’s something
you really want.

237
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,267
What possible harm
could there be
to write a stupid letter?

238
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,139
Okay, I guess.

239
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,798
And the big reason
I write it
is for my mom.

240
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,017
What?
She wants stuff from Santa too?

241
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,062
No.

242
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:59,675
Nobody in this world
loves Christmas
more than my mom.

243
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,242
Or did, anyway.

244
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,812
I just think
me writing the letter
makes her happy.

245
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,076
I like it better
when she'’s happy.

246
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,121
Okay, okay, whatever.

247
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,298
Just keep that letter thing
under wraps.

248
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:18,868
If the kids at school
ever found out about this,
you'’d be destroyed.

249
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,002
- Destroyed.
- You'’re not gonna
tell anyone, right?

250
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,092
Good God, no.
How do you think
it would make me look

251
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,181
that my bestie
still believes in Santa?

252
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,400
I'’m your bestie?

253
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,142
Yeah.

254
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,145
Hey, Gibby...

255
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,801
Remember I told you
we moved out here

256
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,935
because I was supposed to be
in the witness protection
program?

257
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:43,980
Yeah?

258
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,288
Well, that wasn'’t true.

259
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,380
Some bad stuff--

260
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,599
bad stuff happened
back where we used to live.

261
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,298
There was an accident,
and that was right before--

262
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,691
Hey, hey. Have you ever had
the Impossible Burger lasagna?

263
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,345
- What?
- Have you ever had it?

264
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,391
I haven'’t,
but I hear it'’s really good.

265
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:06,655
Come on, Gibby.
I was about to
tell you something huge.

266
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,788
Yeah, that'’s why
I made small talk.

267
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,269
I'’m really bad
with that serious crap.

268
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,185
Yeah, me too.

269
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,145
["Sleigh Ride" playing]

270
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,110
Thanks for letting me
come with you
to mail your letter.

271
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,546
It'’s more fun this way.

272
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,550
Hey, I see the town'’s putting on
a big Christmas carnival
this week.

273
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,552
Maybe you and I
can go to that.

274
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,076
Uh...

275
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,034
Yeah, Mom. Maybe.

276
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,864
A lot of kids from my class
are gonna be there and...

277
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,083
Oh.

278
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,780
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

279
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,272
Come on, baby.
Let'’s go. Come on.

280
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,711
To Santa.

281
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:13,678
Care of the North Pole.

282

[footsteps approach]

283
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:50,933
Huh.

284
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,109
Well, you don'’t see this
very often.

285
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,593
[mother] But why do you
always have to cut me off?[Bill scoffs]

286
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,248
Are you kidding me?
You'’re always cutting me off.

287
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:04,947
[mother] After everything
he'’s been through, I worry
about his mental well-being.

288
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,559
[Bill]
Can we not turn this into
a therapy session?

289
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,171
[mother]
Okay, if believing in Santa
makes him happy,

290
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,129
what right do you have
to say that he can'’t?

291
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,915
Oh, come on.
Don'’t make me the bad guy.

292
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,352
[sighs]
I wish there was a Santa.

293
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,789
Because then I'’d have a pony.

294
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,618
'’Cause that'’s what I asked for
every year when I was a kid.

295
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,664
[mother]
That'’s why you'’re mad?
You never got a pony.

296
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,667
[Bill] Knock it off.

297
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,235
You said
you were gonna talk to him.[mother] And I will.

298
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,324
[Bill] When?[mother] I don'’t know. Soon.

Blitzen, is that you?

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,657
Use the litter box.

[groans] That'’s putrid.

307
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,535
Thank you.[Liam gasps]

308
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,364
Who was that? [exclaims]

[shouts]

310
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,893
Who are you? What do you want?

311
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,941
What do you mean what do I want?
It'’s me.

312
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,464
[Liam] Who?

313
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,162
Me. I got your letter.

314
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:30,902
What letter?

315
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,643
The letter you sent me.

316
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,341
I never sent you a letter.

317
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,473
What do you call this,
fudge nuts?

318
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,436
You had a list in there
asking for all sorts of
stupid crap.

319
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,354
So you mean you'’re S--

320
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,269
In the naughty flesh.

321
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,663
Hey, I really want to thank you
for writing me, Liam.

322
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,535
What an unexpected treat.

323
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,189
Unexpected?

324
00:16:56,363 --> 00:17:00,149
Very. Guess how many letters
I get from kids a year.

325
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,672
I'’m not a guesser.

326
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:02,891
Guess!

327
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,459
Seventy-one million?

328
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:09,202
Seventy-one million? Uh, no.

329
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:10,812
How many?

330
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,727
None. [laughs]

331
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,120
What?

332
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,686
Sure, I get a few manifestos
in the mail

333
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,471
from some wonderfully deranged
grown-ups, but--

334
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:18,907
What is going on here?

335
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,649
This is insane.
You don'’t exist.

336
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:25,783
Really? Do you usually write
letters to people
who don'’t exist?

337
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,700
You'’re just--
You'’re not what I expected.

338
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,659
What'’d you expect?

339
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,228
Well, for one thing,
I thought you'’d be
a little jollier.

340
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:38,013
Jollier?
Who the hell'’s jolly these days?

341
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:39,841
Fair point.

342
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,190
But your suit is different.

343
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,931
And your beard
doesn'’t look the same.

344
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:44,889
But I guess you are, um,

345

the antlers, not you.

Isn'’t the deal I'’m good,
I write you a letter,
you get me stuff?

378

a total myth.
Fake news.

You, my friend,

Three wishes.

Wait,
so there really are genies?

Are you telling me
I can wish for anything
in the whole wide world?

388
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,828
Yeah. I mean, within reason.

389
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,570
I can'’t undo the War of 1812.

390

What'’s the War of 1812?

391
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,662
It was a war. In 1812.

392
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,751
Look, the point is
I can'’t change history.

393

But anything you want
moving forward,
I can deliver.

394
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,799
So, come on, make a wish.

[exhales] Well, I mean,
there'’s a lot I could wish for

396

and I wasn'’t expecting this,
so I'’m trying to think.

397

World peace, climate change.

398
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,114
Geez, childhood hunger is
a big problem right now.

399

Are you kidding me with this?
You don'’t have a wish ready?

400

I mean, you read my letter.
Shouldn'’t you already know
what I want?

401
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,426
Okay, you got me.

402
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,298
I didn'’t read the whole thing.
It was boring.

Besides, what'’s with
all this Goody Two-shoes stuff?

404
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,737
I can give you
anything you want.

405
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,740

A yacht.

406

408

A girl? [snorts]

409
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,834
Is there a girl you like?

410
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,315
Yeah. Emma.

411
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,275
I do kind of wish
she'’d give me a chance.

412
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,190
Boom! Done!

413
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,236
She'’s gonna give you a chance.
That'’s one wish, two to go.

414

- See you tomorrow.
- Wait!

How would I have
the letter back?

his back has been
hurting him lately.

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,227
and maul you
with his tiny teeth and claws

518
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,490
until your own mother
doesn'’t recognize you.

519
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,361
You'’ll never live it down.

520
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,450
You'’ll be the kid
who barely survived
a hamster attack.

521
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,930
Is that what you want?

522
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,585
I'’m not afraid of
a cute, little hamster.

523
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,717
[growls]

524
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,545
[shouts] I'’m going.

525
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,937
[Satan chuckles]

526
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,680
Hey, Emma.

527
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:55,292
L-Liam. Hi. Hey. How are you?

528
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:58,165
Stupid question.
You'’re probably great.
Just ignore that.

529
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,601
No, I'’m fine.

530
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,124
[chuckles]

531
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,736
Anyway, uh,
I came over here to ask

532
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,956
if you wanted to
hang out sometime. Soon.

533
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,567
Me with you?

534
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:11,134
Yes. Definitely.
Where? When?

535
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,747
Uh, maybe we could go to
that Post Malone concert?

536
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:19,012
Or-- Or-- Or not. Uh...

537
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,886
What are you doing?

538
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,715
I don'’t know. I panicked.
It scared me to be that brave.

539
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,282
Go with it, buddy.

540
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,892
You wanna go to
the Posty concert,
you got it.

541
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,415
Now sell it!

542
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,592
- Really?
- Yes!

543
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:35,376
[exhales]

544
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,381
- Hi again.
- Hi.

545
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:44,254
Liam, I don'’t know
if you were being serious.

546
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,430
Like, were you kidding?

547
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,825
If you don'’t wanna take me,
I get it. That'’s okay.

548
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,653
No, no, I was being serious.

549
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:55,570
I just didn'’t know
if your boyfriend would--

550
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,311
That won'’t be a problem.

551
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,792
I broke up with Aiden anyways.

552
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:02,577
Sometimes he wasn'’t that nice.

553
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:04,840
Okay. Uh...

554
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,235
Uh, I'’ll text you the details.

555
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,150
Great. [chuckles]

556
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:12,543
Tootles!

557
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,897
I never say "tootles" either,
just-- just FYI.

558
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,464
That was my first time.

559
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,300
[exhales]
Sue me, I'’m thirsty.

560
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,479
[bell rings]

561
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,134
You'’re going to see
Post Malone with Emma?

562
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,963
Yeah, and that'’s not even
the craziest part.

563
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,792
You won'’t believe
what happened last night.

564
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:47,753
I'’m pretty sure you going to
Post Malone with Emma
is the craziest part.

565
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:50,625
You'’d think so,
but Santa came to my room
last night!

566
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,540
Santa came to your room?

567
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,107
I swear.

568
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,457
But he didn'’t look like Santa.
He had antlers.

569
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:59,678
But then he looked like Santa,
but he explained
he didn'’t walk around like that,

570
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,288
except on Christmas.

571
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,159
That had to be your imagination.

572
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,248
If it was my imagination,

573
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,207
then how do you explain him
being in the cage
with my hamster

574
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:08,948
during science class?

575
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:12,473
Santa Claus was in the cage
- with your hamster?
- Uh-huh.

576
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:16,129
You must'’ve been having
some weird dreams last night.

577
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:18,131
But the hamster thing
happened today.

578
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,654
[Gibby] Whatever.

579
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,657
Night dreams, daydreams,
they can seem real.

580
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,486
Look! There he is.

581
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,531
Where?

582
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,882
On the bench.

583
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,492
[Gibby]
Where on the bench?

584
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,016
[Liam]
The only guy on the bench.

585
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,453
That'’s Santa?

586
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:39,369
Yeah. Yeah, he'’s the one
who brought me my letter back.

587
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,631
Wanna meet him?

588
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,285
Uh, that'’s gonna be a hard pass.

589
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,767
Liam.
Look who you addressed that to.

590
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,030
Santa? So?

591
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,859
Look at it again.
Take your time.

592
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,078
[Liam gasps]

593
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:55,559
Satan. Oh, my God.

594
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,953
Well, at least it somehow
still got to Santa.

595
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,128
Did it?

596
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,131
Are you saying... No.

597
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,090
That can'’t be the devil.
There is no devil.

598
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,396
There'’s no devil,
but there'’s a Santa Claus?

599
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,529
Come on, man. Pick a lane.

600
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,661
See you later, alligator.

601
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,489
What the--

602
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,143
[Satan] Hey, Liam!

603
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,798
There you are. Come over here.

604
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,713
[whistles]

605
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:21,237
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
We'’re burning daylight.

606
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,196
Get over here!

607
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,024
What'’s with
the tiny, slow steps?

608
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,156
Let'’s pick up the pace. Come on.

609
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:29,637
What'’s your deal, kid?

610
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,943
First, you send me a letter,

611
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,814
and then I make
your dreams come true,

612
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,990
and then you avoid me like
I'’m the frickin'’ Easter Bunny?

613
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:38,385
Sorry, I didn'’t see you
over there on the bench
where you were sitting.

614
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,256
Um, can I ask you
a question?

615
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,693
Does Pinocchio poop pinecones?

616
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,653
My God! You are Satan.

617
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,437
No, I'’m not.

618
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,352
Come on, turd breath,
we'’ve already been through this.

619
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:51,485
I'’m your friend, Santy Claus.

620
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,574
Turd breath? [sniffs]

621
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:55,097
Does my breath stink?

622
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,926
No, I was just saying that
to make you feel bad.

623
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,451
[chuckles] Okay, okay.
I'’m Satan. You got me.

624
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,366
Now quit being a baby.

625
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,326
You lucked out big time,
dumbass.
I'’m way better than Santa.

626
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,371
- How?
- Come on, think about it.

627
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:10,460
What do you want
under the Christmas tree?

628
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:12,941
A pair of itchy socks
that Grandma knitted you?

629
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:16,031
Or anything in the world
your little selfish heart
desires?

630
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,121
- Oh, look, it'’s a dove.
- Is it?

631
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,779
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I can'’t move.

632
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,002
If you touch me,
I'’ll scream.

633
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:32,874
Why would I touch you?
I'’m the devil,
not a trusted relative.

634
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:36,356
[laughs] Sorry.
That was low-hanging fruit.

635
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,838
By the way, we got a lot of
those creepy uncle types
down where I'’m from.

636
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:41,927
[grunts]

637
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,929
All right?

638
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,627
Come on.
Now, just relax, kid.

639
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,760
You and I
are gonna do a lot better
if we work together.

640
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,545
I'’m not comfortable with this.

641
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:56,028
I don'’t wanna be seen talking to
some weird guy with horns.

642
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,595
Okay, is it the horns
that bother you?
Watch this.

643
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,904
All gone.

644
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:08,649
Sir, since I was clearly writing
to Santa and not to you,

645
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:12,566
maybe we can just forget
about all this
and you can go on your way.

646
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,351
Not that easy, buddy boy.
You already made
your first wish,

647
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,876
and that means
we have a deal in progress.

648
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,575
There'’s no getting out of
this thing until
all three wishes are used up.

649
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:24,143
By the way, check your phone.

650
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,150
Oh, my God!

651
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,329
That'’s it? OMG?

652
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:37,721
Where'’s my thank-you?

653
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,158
You can'’t get better tickets
than that.

654
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:41,508
That'’s where Mama Posty sits.

655
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:46,513
But I didn'’t ask for tickets.
I wished for Emma to like me.

656
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,864
Nope. Technically,
you wished for her to
give you a chance.

657
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,040
- What'’s the difference?
- Big difference.

658
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:54,608
She'’s gonna give you a chance.
That'’s all.
You can still screw it up.

659
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:57,567
But to give your chance
a chance, I threw in
those tickets as a freebie,

660
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:00,919
'’cause let'’s face it,
your game'’s a little weak.

661
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:05,662
Sir,
I'’m going to politely decline.

662
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,578
You can have those tickets back.
Scalp '’em if you want.

663
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,407
I wanna call off our deal
entirely.

664
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,976
I told you, you can'’t.
You summoned me.

665
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,673
No, I summoned Santa.

666
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,415
Nope.
Pretty sure you wrote "Satan."

667
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,721
S-A-T-A-N.

668
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:22,418
It was a mistake.

669
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,724
There are no mistakes.

670
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,987
Everything happens for a reason.

671
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,467
Just ask your God.

672
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,338
This didn'’t happen for a reason.

673
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,210
It was a total typo.

674
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,515
I have learning differences.

675
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:33,777
[mock crying]

676
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,475
Everyone'’s a victim these days.

677
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:39,522
OCD, ADD, L-M-N-O-P.
Blah, blah, blah.

678
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,698
When I was a kid,
they'’d slap you
in the back of the head

679
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,048
and tell you to suck it up.

680
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:44,614
You were a kid?

681
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,834
I don'’t wanna talk about it.

682
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,969
Liam, you'’re looking
at this thing all wrong.

683
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:54,276
The way I see it,
there'’s some good news
and some other news.

684
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,800
The good news is
you'’ve got two more wishes.

685
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,019
That'’s pretty amazing.

686
00:32:58,193 --> 00:32:59,194
And the other news?

687
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:00,630
Huh?

688
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,024
You said
- there was other news.
- Oh, right.

689
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:05,809
After you make two more wishes,
I'’m taking your soul.

690
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,811
What? Are you insane?

691
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,510
I prefer "sanity adjacent."

692
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,165
Well, what if I don'’t make
the other two wishes?

693
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,210
- You will.
- What if I don'’t?

694
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:18,170
- Uh, trust me, you will.
- And if I don'’t?

695
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:20,520
[sighs]
If you do not make three wishes,

696
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,478
technically,
I cannot take your soul.

697
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:23,914
But you will.

698
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,439
Here.
See that cloud over there?

699
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:29,311
Let me show you
a few of the things
I could do for you.

00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,405
Yeah!

You see that, kid?

714

You ain'’t never had
a friend like me.

Okay, that I may have stolen
from <i>Aladdin.</i>

Now we'’re even. [chuckles]

717
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:30,416
Liam, you got the world
by the oysters.

718
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,114
I don'’t really like oysters.

719
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,638
I think I'’m going to
politely pass on your offer.

720
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,119
What'’s the matter with you?

721
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,642
I don'’t know.

722
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:42,210
I mean,
these are all nice ideas.
I just...

723
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:44,082
I kinda don'’t wanna
give up my soul.

Liam, do you know this man?

727
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,311
Yeah, I'’m his uncle. Beat it.

728
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:57,921
Uh...

729
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,358
Is this true, Liam?

730
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,534
Yes. Yes, it is.

731
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:04,798
Huh. Well, then.

732
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:09,324
Maybe you can suggest to
your nephew to stop being
so inattentive in class.

733
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:10,847
It'’s causing disruptions.

734
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,243
How'’s that again?
I wasn'’t really paying attention
to anything you just said.

735
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,507
I was saying young Liam here
has a bad habit of being in--

736

[chuckles]

737
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,294
Very funny, wise guy.

738
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:25,166
Can you really blame him though?
You'’re pretty damn boring,
you know.

00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,473
Excuse me.

740
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,258
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

741
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,955
Here we go.

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,871

with your dead carcass.

744
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:40,399
Now, I will not tolerate

Dear me.

748
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,450
That doesn'’t sound right.

749
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,844
I hope you'’re not getting
that stomach bug
that'’s been going around.

Pardon me. Kombucha.

I hope it'’s not IBS.
Sometimes that can be unruly.

Gentlemen, excuse me.

758
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,428
It seems nature is calling,
and I intend to answer.

[farting]
Ooh.

760
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:15,651
Oh, my. I'’ve never heard
such a spirited bout
of flatulence.

My kingdom for a toilette.

768
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,537
Did you know every time
a grown man sharts himself,

769
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,278
a demon earns its horns?

770
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,367
It'’s true.

771
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,934

I apologize.
But it appears... [farts]
Oh, no.

776
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,598

and I have to run.

Nice to meet ya!

784
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,968
The pleasure was mine!

785
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,580
[Satan laughs]

786
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,325
Let'’s look at the bright side.

787
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,023
The first two wishes
are freebies, right?

788
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:25,243
He only gets your soul
after the third?

789
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,853
Yeah, but--

790
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:29,595
And you can tap out
at any time before then. Right?

791
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,642
Well, yeah, technically. But I--Well, then what'’s the problem?

792
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:36,993
Look, I'’m worried Satan
is going to trick me
into making more wishes.

793
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,517
He'’s pretty clever.

794
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,693
He pretty much tricked me
into the first one.

795
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,782
Yeah,
that'’s classic Satan stuff.

796
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,784
But I think you'’ll be fine.

797
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,613
Like, you'’re strong.

798
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:50,180
You'’re not gonna make
any more wishes
if you don'’t want to.

799
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:55,490
That'’s what I thought.
But Satan said
I definitely would.

800
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:58,188
Don'’t worry about
what Satan said.

801
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,973
You'’re the nicest kid I know.

802
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,844
Thanks, Gibby.

803
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,716
[groans] All right.

804
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,371
I gotta go convince my parents

805
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,286
into letting me go to
this concert.

806
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,201
That'’s gonna be a tough one.

807
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,029
[sighs]
Yeah. Wish me luck.

808
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,524
Hey, Mom and Dad.
I wanted to ask if I could--

809
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:31,700
Hi, honey.

810
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,834
- Hi.
- Hello, Liam.

811
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,618
I'’m Dr. Finkleman.

812
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,098
Hello.

813
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,927
Dr. Finkleman is
a child psychologist, Liam.

814
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,494
Hmm.

815
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,322
I hear
that'’s an interesting field.

816
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:45,497
Hmm.

817
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:49,022
I'’m gonna go watch
<i>Salt Lake Housewives.</i>

818
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,851
Uh, Liam.

819
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:54,070
Hmm?

820
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:56,638
Dr. Finkleman
is here to see you.

821
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,597
Oh, God.

822
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,295
[Finkleman]
<i>So, I wanna make sure
I have this straight.</i>

823
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:06,126
Uh, first, you thought
Santa came into your bedroom.

824
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,348
But now you think
it wasn'’t Santa,
it was Satan.

825
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:13,089
- Yeah, that'’s right.
- No.

826
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,787
He must be confused.

827
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,745
He means Saint Nick, not Satan.

828
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,705
No, no, that'’s what I thought.

829
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:22,185
But then I realized
it was Satan.

830
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,361
Oh, no.

831
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:25,624
No, no, no, no, no.

832
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,974
No. Think he'’s just confused.

833
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:31,804
Well, um,
let'’s say he is confused.

834
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:36,548
Liam, you confused
Santa and Satan. How?

835
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:41,161
Well, they both have
surprisingly similar styles.

836
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:46,296
I mean, you know, beards,
a generous build,

837
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:49,952
and their clothing is reddish
with black boots.

00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,217

- I don'’t know.

840
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,219

Did you know? What is this?

841
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,308
[Bill] It'’s fully thought out.[mother]
Where is this coming from?

842
00:39:58,483 --> 00:39:59,962
[Bill] It'’s fully realized.[mother] Yeah, it is.

["Congratulations" playing

844
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:02,835
Hey, it'’s not
phone time right now.

845
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,228
Come on, honey. Put it away.

846
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,972
Do you have any idea why Satan
would come visit you
in your room?

847
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:11,496
Well, because I wrote him
a letter.

848
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,369
And again,
why were you writing to Satan?

849
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,023
No, I wasn'’t.

850
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,981
I meant to write it to Santa,

851
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:21,723
but I mixed up the letters
and it went to Satan.

852
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,159
Didn'’t you jot that one down?

853
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,032
- Hey. Liam. Calm down.
- I'’m sorry.

854
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:29,209
It'’s been a tough year,
with the tragedy and all.

855
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:33,779
I know it might sound crazy,
but the devil came to
my bedroom.

856
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,389
With God as my witness.

857
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:40,089
So, is God witnessing you now
as well, Liam?

858
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:42,570
No. That was an expression.

859
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:45,660
Mom, I really need to
talk to you about--Not right now, Liam.

860
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,619
We need to finish talking
with Dr. Finkleman, okay?

861
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,359
And make sure you tell him
the truth.

862
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,666
I am telling him the truth!
I already told you that.

863
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,842
[coughing][mother] He'’s here to help us.

864
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:02,024
[strained]
No, it'’s okay.
I got something stuck.

865
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,419
Dr. Finkleman,
can I get you a water?

866
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,378
I'’m gonna get it.

00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,346
[coughs] Sorry.

[swallows, exhales]

874
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:31,140
Okay, then if that'’s the truth,
thank you for being honest
with us.

875
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:33,665
[Liam]
So, do you believe me?

876
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:35,449
Of course we believe you.

[doorbell rings]

881
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:47,983
Liam.

882
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,210
Hi there.

883
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,386
Can I help you?

884
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,997
I'’m Gibby, Liam'’s friend.

The football player with cancer.

886
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:06,698
Gibby!

887
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:09,657
It is so nice to
- finally meet you.
- Oh.

888
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,920
Nice to meet you too,
Mrs. Turner.

889
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:15,054
Um, how--
how is everything going?
Are you feeling okay?

890
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:18,884
You know, some good days,
some bad days. Mostly bad.

891
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,582
Oh, well, come on in the house.
Let me get you something
to drink.

892
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:24,063
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Turner.
I don'’t have time.

893
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:26,021
I'’m just here to pick up Liam

894
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:29,242
because he promised me to
go to my chemo session with me
tonight.

895
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:31,287
- Yeah.
- Oh.

896
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:32,724
Mom, I was trying
to tell you about that.

897
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,160
Um...

898
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:36,249
But I can go, right?
I mean, Gibby needs me.

899
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:39,078
Oh, well,
I'’m not sure if you--

900
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,949
- Bill?
- I mean-- I--

901
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,218
Of course. Yes. Go, Liam.
Go... Go support your friend.

902
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:52,091
- Do you guys need a ride?
- No need.

903
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:54,659
[parents gasp]
I'’m on the job.
Howdy there, folks.

904
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,226
I'’m Gibby'’s dad,
Gibby the first,
Gibby Senior.

905
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,185
Great to meet.

906
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,535
I'’ll be taking
these two eager beavers
over to the clinic,

907
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,494
and then, if it'’s okay with you,
I'’d like to take them out
for a little boba.

908
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:07,106
How about that, guys?
How'’s that sound? Little boba?

We can'’t get enough of that b--

911
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,376
[stammers] You'’re Gibby'’s dad?

912
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,248
Yes, ma'’am. Unfortunately,
he gets his good looks
from his mom,

913
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:22,382
if you know what I mean.
[laughs, bleats]

914
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:27,561
Anyway, we really appreciate
Liam being such a big support
to Gibby.

915
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:29,694
Time with good friends
is so important.

916

Especially when
you don'’t know...

[whispers]
...how much time you got left.

918

- Yeah.
- But, uh...

[snorts]
...great kid.

920
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,790
You did something right.
Come on, guys. Let'’s go.

921
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:42,228
- Yeah!
- Okay, uh, bye.

922
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:44,273
See you later.

923
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:49,061
Okay. Have fun at chemo.

924
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:53,631
[Liam]
Did you just lie
about chemotherapy?

925
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,851
Do you know how wrong that is?

926
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,158
I do,
and I'’m not proud of it.

927
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,073
I guess the devil made me do it.

928
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:03,423
What the hell is going on?

929
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,120
[car door opens]
It wasn'’t my idea.

930
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:06,948
He came to my house and told me

931
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,168
that you wanted me
to go to the concert too.[horn honking]

932
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:12,867
Come on, you chupacabras!
Hurry up. We'’re gonna be
late for the concert.

[Gibby] This is so cool.

935
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:32,191
I'’ve never been
backstage before.

936
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:34,236
Now, listen up,
mouse knuckle.

00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,022
If you want this girl to
find you interesting enough to
fall for you,

938
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,677
you'’re gonna have to...
[snorts] ...you know.

939
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:41,504
What? Be myself?

940
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,898
No! Do not do that.

941
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,291
You'’re gonna have to trick her.

942
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:47,510
Trick her?
I don'’t wanna trick her.

943
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,949
I just wanna make sure
she gets to see the real me.

944
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,428

945
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,822
And what'’s the real you, Liam?

946
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:58,696

and, I think,
a sensitive person.

Can I give you
some free advice?

You wanna get ahead
in the world,

950
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:06,268
you gotta think about
yourself first.

951

Numero uno.
It'’s a time-tested formula.

952

Just look at your politicians.

953
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,145
Okay.
You know how when
you'’re on a plane,

954
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,017
they say, "Put on
your oxygen mask first
before helping others"?

955
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,846
- Yeah?
- Like that.

956
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,371
Except maybe you don'’t even
have to help anyone else
with their mask, right?

957
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:25,026
Who wants to share oxygen
when a plane'’s going down, anyway?

is my motivation, dude.

You'’re what drives me, man.
Thank you so much
for what you do.

I see you'’ve already caught up
with Posty.

- Great to see you.
- What'’s up, dude? Yes, sir.

00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:16,208
Look, I have to go,
but I wanted you to know.

978
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:18,993
I am going to
kick this show'’s ass,

979
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,648
and I wanna dedicate it
to you tonight, man.

980
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:24,129
I gotta go, dude,
but I love you so much, man.

981
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:27,436
You'’re a living legend.
You'’re an absolute stud.

You'’re the biggest beast
on planet Earth, Liam.

in the universe.

I love you so much,
and I'’ll see you
after the show, man.

- What'’s going on here?

and hopefully for the last time,

I can do cool shit.

988
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,016
But how'’d you get him to
know who I am?

989
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,976
I put him under
a simple, little spell.

Don'’t worry,
- it'’s only temporary.

the sausage gets made, okay?

you'’d only own my soul
if I made three wishes.

1187
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:04,796
- Is that true?
- I swear to God.

1188
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:06,537
So, that m--

1189
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,104
You swear to God?

1190
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:10,584
It'’s a figure of speech.

1191
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,847
I also say "go to hell"
when I'’m pissed,

1192
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:15,763
even though that'’d be like
other people saying,
"Let'’s go to Bermuda."

1193
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:19,158
Okay, good.
I'’d like to make my second wish.

1194
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:23,467
[laughs]
Finally! Here we go.
I was getting worried about you.

1195
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:24,642
So...

1196
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:27,558
what'’ll it be?

1197
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,483
Hi, Liam.

1198
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:43,965
Uh, hi? I guess.

1199
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,186
Good morning, buddy boy.

1200
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,144
Somebody'’s
in a good mood today.

1201
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:53,410
Why wouldn'’t I be?
It'’s a super-duper day to
be alive.

1202
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:57,109
Dude, you look awesome!
What happened?

1203
00:56:57,283 --> 00:57:01,287
I woke up this morning,
and my teeth were just fixed.

1204
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:04,943
My mom always told me
I'’d grow into them,
and I guess she was right.

1205
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:08,468
My parents are happy.
They were about to take me
to go get braces.

1206
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:09,861
Perfect timing.

1207
00:57:10,035 --> 00:57:11,384
What? Why?

1208
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:13,212
Me and Emma are going
to the carnival tonight.

1209
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:14,953
Maybe you wanna double-date?

1210
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:17,521
You don'’t think
she'’d feel like a third wheel?

1211
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:22,177
No, I mean "double date"
as in you bring a girl.

1212
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:26,617
I guess I could ask
my cousin Arielle,
but she'’s kinda picky.

1213
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,619
No, not someone
you'’re related to.

1214
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:30,098
A real girl.

1215
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:31,839
I mean, you are a stud.

1216
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:34,189
S-U-T-D. A stud.

1217
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:37,323
Actually, maybe you'’re right.

1218
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,108
Me being this handsome
might magically attract girls,

1219
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,850
so, you know,
why bring sand to the beach?

1220
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:45,157
Tonight,
I could be a free agent.

1221
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:46,811
Now you'’re talkin'’.

1222
00:57:46,985 --> 00:57:47,942
See you.

1223
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:50,292
["Christmas in Hollis" playing]

1224
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,468
Hey, Gibby.

1225
00:57:58,431 --> 00:57:59,476
[gasps]

1226
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:06,047
This is dope.

1227
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:07,875
Very.

1228
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:11,444
[laughing, chattering]

1229
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:19,452
Hey, look. That'’s Liam.

1230
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:21,410
That is him. Isn'’t it?

1231
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:23,500
This is sick, buddy.

1232
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:26,111
Somehow or another,
we became the cool kids.

1233
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:27,765
Who would'’ve thunk it?
[chuckles]

1234
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:29,462
Hey, where'’s Emma?

1235
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:31,333
Uh, she should be here
any minute.

1236
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:39,037
Do you really think
this is necessary?

1237
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:42,823
Molly, I don'’t know about you,
but-- but I-I-I'’m terrified.

1238
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:45,043
He'’s been talking nonstop
about Satan.[sighs]

1239
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:46,827
But are we sure
that we heard him say "Satan"

1240
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,177
and not "Jason" or "Layton" or--

1241
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:52,224
- Who'’s Jason or Layton?
- I have no idea.
I'’m reaching.

1242
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:54,226
Listen, we both definitely
heard him say

1243
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,315
that tonight is the night
it all goes down.

1244
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:58,012
We gotta do somethin'’.

1245
00:58:58,926 --> 00:58:59,971
Hey, guys.

1246
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:01,625
Sorry I'’m late.

1247
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:03,627
Gibby, you look so good.

1248
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,150
Everyone'’s talking about it.

1249
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:07,065
Thanks, Emma. [chuckles]

1250
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:09,371
I can'’t believe how much fun
that was last night, Liam.

1251
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,809
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

1252
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,375
You'’re so humble.

1253
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,856
You never let on at all
about any of your talents.

1254
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:18,685
I'’ma get a corn dog.

1255
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:21,601
Uh, do you guys want one?

1256
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:22,602
Sure.

1257
00:59:22,776 --> 00:59:24,038
- Yeah.
- All right.

1258
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:25,257
Be right back.

1259
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:27,694
[sighs]

1260
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:29,304
Are you ready?

1261
00:59:29,478 --> 00:59:30,523
Yeah.

1262
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:33,874
Go get him.

1263
00:59:34,048 --> 00:59:35,180
Me?

1264
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:37,051
Yeah. You'’re--
He listens to you.

1265
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:38,313
[sighs]

1266
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:42,579
- I'’m the driver.
- Fine, fine.

1267
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:48,585
You got it.

1268
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,197
[vendor] Come and get them.

1269
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:54,982
Nitrates, sodium,
artificial flavors.

1270
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:56,680
Really bad for you.

1271
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:57,768
Oh, hey there, kid.

1272
00:59:57,942 --> 00:59:59,465
What are you doing here?

1273
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,206
I'’m just staying close by,
you know,

1274
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,426
in case I'’m needed for, uh,
say, a third and final wish.

1275
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,907
Yeah, well, you won'’t be.

1276
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:08,779
And I wanna thank you
for your service.

1277
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:11,390
You wanna thank me
for my service?

1278
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:15,263
I'’m done.
I really don'’t need
anything else.

1279
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:18,527
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask you something?

1280
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,139
Why aren'’t you taking credit
for what you did for your buddy?

1281
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:23,358
What? Why should I?

1282
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:26,100
I mean, literally
the only reason to
do stuff for other people

1283
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:27,711
is to get the credit.

1284
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:29,147
So then they owe you something.

1285
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,062
What about doing
something nice for a person

1286
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:32,498
because you care about them?

1287
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:33,891
Like out of kindness.

1288
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,023
I don'’t even know
what you just said.

1289
01:00:36,197 --> 01:00:38,809
I mean, I know all the words,
but I just never heard them
in that order.

1290
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:40,071
Like a selfless act.

1291
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:41,420
Still not following.

1292
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:42,769
Forget it.

1293
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:47,382
Hey, Mrs. Turner.
Is everything all right?

1294
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:50,342
I'’m Gibby, Liam'’s friend.

1295
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,518
The football player with cancer.

1296
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:54,563
Yeah, no, I know.
Gibby, hi.

1297
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:57,915
God,
you just look so healthy.

1298
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:01,440
The, uh, treatment
seems to really be working.

1299
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:04,008
Yes, it'’s, uh,
doing the trick.

1300
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:08,012
Have, um-- Have you seen Liam?
I-- I just need to talk to him
for a second.

1301
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:10,841
Yeah, he'’s over there
at the corn dog stand.

1302
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:12,886
Corn dog. Okay.
Thank you.

1303
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,061
Bye now.

1304
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,412
It was a pleasure
doing business with you,

1305
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:20,111
but I made my two wishes
and I wanna enjoy them.

1306
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:22,940
So no offense, but bye.

1307
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:27,727
Oh! Oh. And can I get
three corn dogs?

1308
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,034
Not a wish. I'’m paying cash.

1309
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,862
Coming right up!

1310
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:35,126
Three corn dogs,
extra goat lips.

1311
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,649
On the house.

1312
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:38,477
Extra spicy.

1313
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,176
Enjoy.

1314
01:01:43,395 --> 01:01:45,876
And don'’t chew
with your mouth open.
It'’s gross.

1315
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:53,274
Mom,
what are you doing here?

1316
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:56,016
Liam, I'’ve been looking for you.
I just need you to come with me, please.

1317
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,670
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

1318
01:01:57,844 --> 01:01:59,063
But I'’m with my friends.

1319
01:01:59,237 --> 01:02:00,673
Liam, honey,
this will only take a moment.

1320
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:03,589
Everything'’s okay.
Just come with me.

1321
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:05,852
What are you doing?
Why are you pulling me so hard?

1322
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,506
- Come on. Hey, come on.
- Emma and Gibby.

1323
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,899
Let'’s go, let'’s go.
It'’s okay.

1324
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:10,596
- I just-- I missed you.
- No-- Wait.

1325
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,337
- I needed to see you quick.
- What'’s Daddy doing here?

1326
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,252
- Honey, how was the carnival?
- We loved the carnival.

1327
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:16,384
I got him! I got him!
- All right.
- Liam. Give me the corn dogs!

1328
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:18,082
Come on. I see it.[Liam] Wait! Help!

1329
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:20,606
- I see it. I got it.
- Be careful!
Don'’t hurt him.

1330
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,216
- I did it already.
- Liam, lean back.

1331
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,088
Let'’s go.

1332
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,525
Why are you doing this?[Molly]
Because we love you.

1333
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:29,049
This is a horrible way to
show it.
I'’m on a date.

1334
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:30,572
[Molly]
Of course you are.

1335
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,365
[exhales]

1336
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:41,540
[clears throat]

1337
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:44,935
Everything'’s gonna
be all right, Liam.

1338
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:48,852
We'’re gonna do a few tests
and keep you overnight.

1339
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:52,420
Now I'’m gonna go talk to
your parents
about a course of treatment.

1340
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:54,161
Be right back.

1341
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:56,860
Course of treatment?

1342
01:02:57,034 --> 01:02:59,819
Take me to
Christmas carnival, please.

1343
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:07,696
What the hell
did they do to you, McMurphy?

1344
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,698
Who'’s McMurphy?

1345
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,962
[exclaims] <i>Cuckoo'’s Nest.</i>

1346
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:14,268
It saddens me
that you don'’t know that.

1347
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:16,836
Now, listen up, comrade.

1348
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,664
I can get you out of here
in two seconds.

1349
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:20,971
- Really?
- Of course.

1350
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,755
You'’ve still got
your third wish, remember?

1351
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:25,192
Yeah, well,
I'’m not giving you my soul.

1352
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,890
No deal.

1353
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:29,153
Okay, your call.

1354
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,546
Just looks like your friends
are having so much fun

1355
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,940
at the Winter
Christmas Carnival.

1356
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:38,031
[Emma] <i>Liam never even
said goodbye, though.</i>

1357
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:39,641
<i>I hope he'’s okay.</i>

1358
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,730
<i>Ah, I'’m sure he'’s fine.</i>

1359
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:43,210
I'’m not fine.

1360
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:44,908
[Emma]
<i>How are you doing, Gibby?</i>

1361
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:47,345
<i>Don'’t worry.
I won'’t tell anyone.</i>

1362
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:52,829
<i>I know how freaked out
people can get when they
find out someone has... cancer.</i>

1363
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:55,570
[Gibby] <i>Yeah.</i> Oh, you'’ve gotta be joking me.

1364
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:59,139
[Gibby] <i>They look at you
like you'’re a patient,
not a person.</i>

1365
01:03:59,313 --> 01:04:00,880
You don'’t even have cancer!

1366
01:04:01,054 --> 01:04:03,274
<i>Well, I think
you'’re really brave.</i>

1367
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,538
<i>Soldiers are brave.</i>

1368
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:09,106
<i>I'’m just courageous.</i>

1369
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,369
[Satan chuckles]
This kid is good.

1370
01:04:11,543 --> 01:04:14,328
You gotta hand it to him.
He'’s got the moves.

1371
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:16,896
He does not have
the moves at all.

1372
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,376
I don'’t know, Liam.

1373
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,161
Looks like
they'’re really hitting it off.

1374
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:26,558
<i>Gibby, do you mind me asking
what kind of cancer you have?</i>

1375
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:30,649
<i>The super-duper bad kind.</i>

1376
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:32,433
[groans]

1377
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:33,913
You got to admit, Liam,

1378
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,523
they make a cute couple.

1379
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:37,221
No, they do not!

1380
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:38,483
Stop it.

1381
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:40,572
I know what you'’re trying to do.

1382
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:44,010
I'’m not making my third wish.

1383
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,794
Now get out of here.

1384
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,492
Okay, your call.

1385
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:51,191
I'’ll just head back to my room.

1386
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:53,411
You have a room over here?

1387
01:04:53,585 --> 01:04:56,501
I'’m staying at
the Red Rum Motor Lodge.

1388
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:58,633
You can probably guess
my room number.

1389
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:00,679
[laughing]

1390
01:05:03,812 --> 01:05:05,902
It'’s 666, just in case
you didn'’t know.

1391
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,861
[sighs]

1392
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:16,913
It'’s gonna be okay.

1393
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:20,133
Whatever this is, we'’ll--
we'’ll get through it together.

1394
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,135
[Finkleman sighs]

1395
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,794
Uh, I have bad news.

1396
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:32,363
He does not have a brain tumor.

1397
01:05:32,537 --> 01:05:34,278
[sighs]
Damn it!

1398
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:35,757
Well, what is it then?

1399
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,237
Why is he acting this way?

1400
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:40,284
Why are you acting this way?
This is good news.

1401
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:44,679
Talking about Lucifer
and-and Post Malone.

1402
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:45,985
That'’s good news?

1403
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:48,248
Be honest, Doc.
Is there any hope?

1404
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:52,252
Usually, I--
I'’m a "optimistic person,"

1405
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:54,385
but in this particular case,
I'’ve gotta tell you,

1406
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,256
the delusions seem to
be more acute--Dr. Finkleman.

1407
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:58,128
Do you know who that is
- in there?
- In where?

1408
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:00,130
In the imaging room.

1409
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:02,610
That'’s the kid that
blew Post Malone
off the stage last night.

1410
01:06:02,784 --> 01:06:03,829
- What?
- No, no, no.

1411
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,526
Don'’t-- Don'’t listen to him.

1412
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,354
He-- He'’s--
He'’s a little delirious
right now.

1413
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:09,226
Mmm. No. I was there.

1414
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,879
- Where?
- At the show.

1415
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,708
The kid killed.
He'’s a rock star.

1416
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:15,406
- Here.
- Is this person a patient?

1417
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,277
This.[audience cheering]

Oh, my God. That'’s Liam![Molly] Liam.

1421
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:25,198
- Who took him to this?
- There'’s a lot of people there.

1422
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:28,419
[Molly] Is he moonwalking?[Bill] It'’s not great,
but it'’s spirited.

1423
01:06:28,593 --> 01:06:30,290
He'’s so cool.

1424
01:06:30,464 --> 01:06:32,205
That'’s our son?
This was last night?[Molly] Oh, my God.

1425
01:06:32,379 --> 01:06:34,729
Uh-oh. Here'’s when
- we all went backstage.
- What?

1426
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:37,036
[crowd chanting]
<i>Liam! Liam! Liam!</i> Is he playing beer pong?

1427
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,211
[Bill] What?

1428
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:45,914
[Satan] <i>Yeah! Yeah!
That'’s what I'’m talking about.
Yeah![laughing]</i>

1429
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,049

He'’s so good at beer pong.

1430
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:51,790
Oh, no.

01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:53,792
Yeah.[chanting]
<i>Liam! Liam! Liam!</i>

01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:00,712
[sighs] Liam,
can we just talk for a moment?

1433
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:03,149
No! You ruined my life!

1434
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:05,760
Look, I know it was scary.

1435
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:07,545
It'’s just that
the doctors were try-- were--

1436

I should'’ve believed him.

[scoffs]

1441
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,048
What, that he was a rock star?

1442
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:35,312
I mean,
why would you believe that?

1443
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,879
Because he said he was.

1444
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:39,838
And he'’s my son.

1445
01:07:42,928 --> 01:07:45,931
You did everything
a good father would do.

1446
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:50,153
Did I?Under the circumstances,

1447
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,459
yeah.

1448

Hey, you are
a really good father, Bill.

1449
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,465
Really, you'’re amazing.

1450
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:00,902
Thank you.

1451
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,040
Oh, and, Bill,

1452
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:10,738
I'’m sorry you never
got that pony
when you were a kid.

Hey.

Hey. What the heck happened
to you tonight?

<i>My parents are freaks.
That'’s what happened.</i>

Well, we missed you, man.
Wasn'’t as fun without you.

Oh, really? Sure looked like
you were having a good time.

What do you mean?

01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:41,204
<i>You were all over her.</i>

1462
01:08:41,378 --> 01:08:43,858
I saw everything.
Satan showed it to me.

1463
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:45,817
<i>Satan showed it to you?</i> Yeah.

1464
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:47,906
<i>He put it on the monitor.</i>

1465
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,690
So, you were just spying on us?

1466
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,214
<i>I was riveted.</i>

01:08:56,088 --> 01:08:58,525
You were the one
who came up with the cancer lie.

<i>I guess that
no good deed goes unpunished.</i>

1471
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:04,401
So, making up a story
that I'’m dying
is your good deed?

1472
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,360
<i>No. Fixing your teeth
was my good deed.</i>

1473
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,232
What? <i>That'’s right.</i>

1474
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:11,886
I used my second wish
to straighten out your teeth.

1475
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,932
I didn'’t go after Emma.

1476
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:16,282
And I never asked you to
fix my teeth.

1477
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:19,329
Yeah, well,
I was being a good friend.
You should try it sometime.

1480
01:09:29,077 --> 01:09:30,644
Maybe he'’s right.

1481
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:32,385
Maybe he did meet the devil.

1482
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:35,083
Oh, come on.

1483
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,564
You'’re the one who said
that we should believe him.

1484
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:38,739
Within reason.

1485
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:40,480
Bill, you saw him.

1486
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,830
He was singing and dancing
and he was playing beer pong.

1487
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:45,006
Our son can'’t do
any of those things.

1488
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:48,053
Maybe he was practicing
at school.

1489
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:50,229
Beer pong in middle school?

1490
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:54,190
Maybe it was lemonade pong.

1491
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:56,104
Okay, yeah.

1492
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,106
Well, obviously,
he'’s a natural.

1493
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,196
I mean, I was in a frat.

1494
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,719
Yes, we know.

1495
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:05,331
There'’s gotta be
some explanation.

1496
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,115
Yeah, maybe there is.

1497
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,205
Maybe he'’s telling the truth.

1498
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,729
Are you listening to
yourself, Molly?

1499
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:14,688
You'’re actually wondering
out loud if
there really is a devil?

1500
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:17,256
Well, if there isn'’t,
then who took Spencer from us?

1501
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:19,693
God?

1502
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:23,828
Would God take Liam'’s
little brother
away from him?

1503
01:10:25,656 --> 01:10:26,744
[Molly sighs]

1504
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:33,925
There are bad things
in this world, Bill--
horrible things--

1505
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:36,232
and we'’ve seen them firsthand.

1506
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:37,711
Where do you think
they come from?

1507
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:39,147
Stop it, Molly.

1508
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:46,198
Spencer didn'’t die
because of God or the devil.

1509
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,809
He died because--

1510
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,724
Because I let them play outside
without watching them.

1511
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:52,683
Just say it. It was my fault.

1512
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:56,730
- I didn'’t say that.
- But you were thinking it.

1513
01:10:56,904 --> 01:10:59,603
Don'’t tell me
- what I'’m thinking, okay?
- You certainly don'’t tell me.

1514
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:02,083
[Bill]
Maybe it'’s because I don'’t know
what I think anymore!

1515
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,434
Nothing around here
makes any damn sense.

1516
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,044
[Molly]
Yeah, I know you don'’t.

1517
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:17,360
Maybe tomorrow,
I'’ll just go to my sister'’s
for a while.

1518

01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:45,362
Buckle up.

1690
01:20:50,106 --> 01:20:51,455
[engine starts]

1691
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,806
You know what I'’m gonna do
when we get home?

1692
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:59,245
I'’m gonna bake us a batch of
those Rudolph the Reindeer
pastries

1693
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:00,856
you guys love so much.

1694
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:05,295
[chuckles] Oh, boy.

1695
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:07,427
["Bad to the Bone" playing]

1696
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:26,794
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1697
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:28,622
What do you think you'’re doing?

1698
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:30,886
We'’ve been over this, slick.

1699
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:34,759
You don'’t cross
till you hear the word "go."

1700
01:21:35,455 --> 01:21:37,980
Go. There.

1701
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:40,417
How many times
do I have to say this?
I am in--

1702
01:21:40,591 --> 01:21:42,114
[horn honks]
Oh, my God!

1703
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:44,377
Slow down! What was--

1704
01:21:44,551 --> 01:21:46,336
No! Children![whistle blows]

1705
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:48,381
Hey! No![whistle blows]

1706
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:52,342
[horn honks]
Hey! Do your job,
you banana head!

1707
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,170
I am doing my job.

1708
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:55,475
You don'’t know.

1709
01:21:56,346 --> 01:21:57,913
You didn'’t take the course.

1710
01:21:58,522 --> 01:21:59,566
[horn honks]

1711
01:22:07,574 --> 01:22:09,794
Oh. Look who it is.

1712
01:22:10,577 --> 01:22:12,797
Mr. Dance-On-The-Stage Guy.

1713
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,539
Wow. That'’s a good one.

1714
01:22:15,713 --> 01:22:17,497
Are all your insults that good?

1715
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:20,892
Do you just describe something
a person did
but in a snarky tone?

1716
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:21,937
Masterful.

1717
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:25,201
I'’ve tried
to be nice to you.

1718
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:28,769
And that'’s gotten really boring
and tiresome.

1719
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,598
So instead,
I'’m gonna tell you the truth.

1720
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:34,123
You'’re so insecure
about yourself,

1721
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:37,822
rather than develop
any personality,

1722
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:40,477
you bully other kids
who you think won'’t fight back.

1723
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:43,871
You gonna let him
talk to you like that, Aiden?

1724
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:46,178
Yeah, he will,
'’cause he'’s a coward.

1725
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:48,398
Stand up to any bully,

1726
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:50,269
and you'’ll see
their true colors.

1727
01:22:50,443 --> 01:22:51,749
Deep down, they'’re just--

1728
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:53,620
[groans][Aiden'’s friends exclaim]

1729
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,277
[exhales]

1730
01:22:58,451 --> 01:22:59,844
We done here?

1731
01:23:02,368 --> 01:23:04,588
Yeah. I'’m good.

1732
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:06,546
Good.

1733
01:23:09,245 --> 01:23:10,333
Gentlemen.

1734
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,250
[bell ringing]

1735
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,557
All right, students.

1736
01:23:17,731 --> 01:23:21,170
Let'’s flip the on switch
to your medulla oblongatas.

1737
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:25,043
Now, I know this is the last day
before your Christmas break.

1738
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:27,176
Whoo!

1739
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,441
But your frail little minds
must not wander into
the land of sugarplums.

1740
01:23:31,615 --> 01:23:34,444
Has anyone in here
actually ever had a sugarplum?

1741
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:37,882
Hmm? That tasty
17th-century delicacy.

1742
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:39,362
Other than me, obviously.

1743
01:23:41,277 --> 01:23:44,062
Liar. You are a liar, son.

1744
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,457
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed

1745
01:23:47,631 --> 01:23:53,028
as we discuss probably
one of the most overrated books
in history,

1746
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:56,379
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

1747
01:23:56,553 --> 01:23:59,817
Now, if I was publisher,
I would'’ve titled it
<i>To Kill a Manuscript.</i>

1748
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:01,079
[chuckles]

1749
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:02,646
Oh, Mr. Turner,

1750
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:05,997
is your head
in the clouds again?

1751
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,565
Don'’t start with me today, bud.
Not in the mood.

1752
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:13,352
What did you just say to me?

1753
01:24:13,526 --> 01:24:14,919
Did I stutter?

1754
01:24:16,138 --> 01:24:19,402
Mr. Turner, what on earth
has gotten into you?

1755
01:24:19,576 --> 01:24:22,709
I'’m just getting tired
of your act.

1756
01:24:22,883 --> 01:24:24,276
My act, is it?

1757
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,713
Yeah, constantly putting down
great books

1758
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:29,455
to help you feel better
about your own failures.

1759
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:31,588
I mean,
what have you ever written?

1760
01:24:32,763 --> 01:24:34,112
Nothing, right?

1761
01:24:34,286 --> 01:24:35,722
Nothing good, anyway,

1762
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:37,594
or you wouldn'’t be
a sixth-grade English teacher.

1763
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:45,863
Wow. That was
quite the kill shot there, Liam.

1764
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:50,520
You actually might have a point.

1765
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:57,570
Certainly, my father
and ex-wife would agree
with your assessment.

1766
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:11,236
[bell ringing]

1767
01:25:12,977 --> 01:25:14,021
Emma.

1768
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,114
Emma, wait.

1769
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:20,724
What?

1770
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:22,987
Oh, I wanted to apologize

1771
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,815
for running out
in the middle of our date.

1772
01:25:25,642 --> 01:25:26,860
Don'’t worry about it.

1773
01:25:27,034 --> 01:25:28,862
Gibby told me
your mom needed you at home.

1774
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:33,258
You wanna walk home
together?

1775
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:35,042
I don'’t think so.

1776
01:25:35,217 --> 01:25:36,131
Oh.

1777
01:25:36,305 --> 01:25:38,045
Um, why?

1778
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,656
You were a jerk.

1779
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:42,180
What?

1780
01:25:42,354 --> 01:25:44,530
In class with Mr. Charles.

1781
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:46,576
You were totally soul-crushing.

1782
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:49,579
You called him a failure
in front of the whole class.

1783
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:55,411
You know, I broke up with Aiden
because I thought
I found someone nice.

1784
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,587
Turns out I was wrong.

1785
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:59,284
You'’re nothing but a bully.

1786
01:26:01,243 --> 01:26:02,244
Goodbye.

1787
01:26:03,723 --> 01:26:05,116
[crying]

1788
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:12,341
<i>We'’re gonna go back-to-back.
On three. We'’re doing bubble judging.</i>

1789
01:26:12,515 --> 01:26:14,343
<i>We'’ll see who-- Dad, can you count to three?</i>

1790
01:26:14,517 --> 01:26:17,868
<i>Yeah. One, two, three.</i>[Molly] <i>Spencer, that'’s...</i>
[laughs]

1791
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:19,522
[Bill] <i>Count down. Okay, ready?</i>

1792
01:26:19,696 --> 01:26:21,088
[Bill] <i>All right,
Mom'’s gonna count it down.</i>

1793
01:26:21,263 --> 01:26:23,395
[Molly] <i>Three, two, one.</i>

1794
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:26,093
<i>Guys, on one. Okay.</i>[Bill] <i>It'’s a duel.</i>
[chuckles]

1795
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:29,053
<i>I didn'’t know
what was happening.</i>[all whooping]

1796
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:31,142
<i>I'’m gonna catch it.
I'’m gonna catch it.</i>[Liam] <i>It'’s like a hot dog.</i>

1797
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:33,840
<i>Yeah, be very gentle.
Like it'’s your child.</i>

1798
01:26:34,014 --> 01:26:36,060
[parents exclaim, laugh]

1799
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:37,757
[Spencer]
<i>Good job, Mom.
You did so good.</i>

1800
01:26:37,931 --> 01:26:39,977
[Bill]
<i>The biggest bubble
that lasted that long.</i>

1801
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:42,980
<i>High five. That was beautiful.</i>[Molly] <i>My number one--
My number one fan.</i>

1802
01:26:43,546 --> 01:26:46,201
[line ringing]

1803
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:48,377
[Liam] <i>I'’m trying to slice
these bubbles.[Bill] Wait, Liam. Wait.</i>

1804
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,207
[chimes]

1805
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:54,121
Hey.[Gibby] <i>Hey.</i>

1806
01:26:54,296 --> 01:26:55,862
<i>Whatcha doing?</i>

1807
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:57,995
Nothing.

1808
01:26:58,169 --> 01:26:59,866
Just watching
old videos of my brother.

1809
01:27:00,563 --> 01:27:01,564
You have a brother?

1810
01:27:01,738 --> 01:27:03,043
<i>Yeah.</i>

1811
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,654
<i>Well, I used to.</i>

1812
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:07,352
<i>Spencer, he, um-- he died.</i>

1813
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:09,528
What?

1814
01:27:09,702 --> 01:27:12,009
Why didn'’t you ever
tell me that? <i>You wouldn'’t let me, remember?</i>

1815
01:27:12,183 --> 01:27:14,185
<i>You wanted to talk about
the Impossible Burger lasagna.</i>

1816
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:16,535
Oh, by the way,
I tried it. It is good.

1817
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:18,276
Oh, crap.

1818
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:20,104
<i>I'’m so, so sorry.</i>

1819
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,759
<i>That'’s a rough one, man.</i>

1820
01:27:22,933 --> 01:27:24,239
Thanks, Gibby.

1821
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:28,068
I'’m really sorry
about what I said
the other night.

1822
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:32,029
I know you weren'’t trying to,
you know, with Emma.

1823
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:34,074
I would hope not.

1824
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,120
What kind of monster
do you think I am, man?

1825
01:27:36,294 --> 01:27:37,817
It'’s Satan'’s fault.

1826
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:39,993
He made me suspicious.

1827
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:42,039
Isn'’t that one of
the seven deadly sins?

1828
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:43,649
Are there really seven?

1829
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:46,696
What chance do we have?

1830
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:49,394
[sighs]
<i>Actually, it'’s my fault too.</i>

1831
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:52,484
<i>I should'’ve never fixed
your teeth
without your permission.</i>

1832
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:55,139
<i>I was drunk with power.</i>

1833
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:57,881
<i>Well, I'’m sorry too.</i>

1834
01:27:59,099 --> 01:28:00,536
<i>I kinda suspected</i>

1835
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:04,627
<i>you were the one
who, you know, fixed my teeth.</i>

1836
01:28:04,801 --> 01:28:05,715
You did?

1837
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:08,326
Come on, I'’m not an idiot.

1838
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,808
I guess I just didn'’t wanna
admit that Satan
was helping me too.

1839
01:28:11,982 --> 01:28:14,898
Yeah, I guess there is
a bit of a stigma to that.

1840
01:28:16,073 --> 01:28:17,422
<i>I was being a jerk.</i>

1841
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:19,381
<i>I mean,</i>

1842
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:22,732
<i>you used
your last freebie wish on me.</i>

1843
01:28:22,906 --> 01:28:25,300
You could'’ve fixed
your own physical malformities,

1844
01:28:25,474 --> 01:28:26,953
but instead, you thought of me.

1845
01:28:27,127 --> 01:28:28,477
<i>That'’s pretty cool.</i>

1846
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:30,261
What physical malformities?

1847
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:31,436
Huh?

1848
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:35,875
Anyway, Merry Christmas, Liam.

1849
01:28:36,615 --> 01:28:37,747
<i>You too, Gib.</i>

1850
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:38,835
<i>You'’re a good friend.</i>

1851
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:41,446
<i>Right back at ya, bestie.</i>

1852
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:44,319
<i>So, what do you think
happened to Satan?</i>

1853
01:28:44,493 --> 01:28:48,235
[Liam] <i>Meh,
I'’m sure he'’s back down there,
sitting on his throne.</i>

1854
01:29:02,162 --> 01:29:05,557
Welcome back to hell,
my loyal subject.

1855
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:07,167
I trust you traveled safely.

1856
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,735
Yes, your lowness.
Thank you for asking.

1857
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:11,520
It was a smooth trip, indeed.

1858
01:29:11,694 --> 01:29:14,566
I was being facetious,
you dumbass.

1859
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:19,223
Not only did you go rogue
without my permission,

1860
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:22,357
you also failed miserably
on your mission.

1861
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,923
I can'’t take that kid'’s soul.

1862
01:29:24,097 --> 01:29:25,708
W-W-Why not?

1863
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:28,493
I'’ll tell you...
[mock stammers] ...why not.

1864
01:29:29,276 --> 01:29:31,278
'’Cause you screwed the pooch.

1865
01:29:31,453 --> 01:29:34,020
That was only once,
and I was going through a thing.

1866
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:35,674
First of all, ew.

1867
01:29:35,848 --> 01:29:38,416
And I mean
you screwed up big time.

1868
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:43,073
So, your deal with this kid,
Liam, is null and void.

1869
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:44,596
Null and void?

1870
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:47,033
- Mm-hmm. It'’s a legal term.
- I know that.

1871
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:49,427
No. I don'’t know
if you know it.

1872
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:52,256
'’Cause when I said
"null and void," you said
"null and void?" Like that.

1873
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,084
Like you didn'’t have
any idea what that meant.

1874
01:29:54,258 --> 01:29:56,303
- I know null and void.
- Hang on a second.

1875
01:29:56,478 --> 01:30:00,482
Just out of curiosity,
what-what is the definition of
null and void, hmm?

1876
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:04,224
Null and void,
I think it means, like...

1877
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,532
"Null" means, like, "no."

1878
01:30:07,706 --> 01:30:08,925
And "void" means--

1879
01:30:09,099 --> 01:30:11,014
I mean, "void" means
"null and void."

1880
01:30:11,188 --> 01:30:12,494
You know, null and void.

1881
01:30:12,668 --> 01:30:15,105
Okay, so, null and void
means "null and void"?

1882
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:17,107
Yes. [chuckles]

1883
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:20,763
That'’s like saying hippopotamus
means, uh, "hippopotamus."

1884
01:30:20,937 --> 01:30:22,852
Okay,
I don'’t know null and void.

1885
01:30:23,026 --> 01:30:24,897
But how did I screw up?

1886
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:27,422
I got him to ask for
the three wishes,
fair and square.

1887
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:31,164
They'’re supposed to be
evil wishes, you moron.

1888
01:30:31,338 --> 01:30:33,950
Or at least shallow
and greedy wishes.

1889
01:30:34,124 --> 01:30:37,606
He asked me to be with
a cute girl.
That'’s shallow and greedy.

1890
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,739
Yeah, but, I mean,
you tricked him into it.

1891
01:30:40,913 --> 01:30:44,264
Oh, come on.
He wanted her.
You know that.

1892
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,484
Okay. Maybe he did. All right.
I'’ll give you that one.

1893
01:30:46,658 --> 01:30:49,748
But the other two
were definitely pure
and for the benefit of others.

1894
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:52,490
I mean, how the hell
am I supposed to work
with someone like that?

1895
01:30:52,664 --> 01:30:57,800
Plus, B-T-Dubs, you got a soul
under false pretenses.

1896
01:30:57,974 --> 01:30:59,366
But that'’s our MO.

1897
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:02,326
Since when do we not operate
under false pretenses?

1898
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,067
You pretended to be me.

1899
01:31:04,241 --> 01:31:07,418
Never. I never said I was you.

1900
01:31:07,592 --> 01:31:11,117
I explained how there was no way
that I was you,

1901
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:12,728
that there was only
one real Satan, you,

1902
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:15,426
and how the rest of us
just aid and serve you,

1903
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,648
but that, without question, you,
your lowness,
are the one and only big D--

1904
01:31:19,822 --> 01:31:20,649
You'’re lying.

1905
01:31:21,693 --> 01:31:23,739
Yeah. I mean, of course.
[chuckling]

1906
01:31:23,913 --> 01:31:25,175
I'’m a liar.

1907
01:31:25,349 --> 01:31:28,047
Now, take off
those bullshit horns already!

1908
01:31:28,744 --> 01:31:30,963
Oh. [chuckles] Yeah. Uh...

1909
01:31:31,137 --> 01:31:35,228
[grunts]
I was just wearing them
until I earned my real horns.

1910
01:31:35,402 --> 01:31:38,275
Yeah, well,
that'’s not happening.

1911
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:42,148
You'’re not getting horns,
and you'’ll never be
a real demon.

1912
01:31:42,322 --> 01:31:44,542
What? Come on!

1913
01:31:44,716 --> 01:31:46,413
Can'’t you just give me
one more shot at it?

1914
01:31:46,588 --> 01:31:48,415
That kid
was a tough nut to crack.

1915
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:50,983
I tried everything.
He was incorruptible.

1916
01:31:51,157 --> 01:31:54,117
Look, no offense,
but just-- I mean...

1917
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,901
It'’s just not
a good fit anymore.
You know?

1918
01:31:56,075 --> 01:31:57,947
[laughs]

1919
01:31:58,121 --> 01:32:01,646
What are you talking about?
I busted my ass for you
for centuries.

1920
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:03,169
I understand,

1921
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:05,868
but some "demigorgons"
and demidemons

1922
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:08,348
are just not meant
to be full demons, okay?

1923
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:09,741
Sorry.

1924
01:32:09,915 --> 01:32:11,090
It'’s not me, it'’s you.

1925
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:12,439
Seriously?

1926
01:32:12,614 --> 01:32:15,965
You have one hour to
say your bye-byes.

1927
01:32:17,227 --> 01:32:18,271
Wow.

1928
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:23,407
Tootles.

1929
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:28,543
That'’s the first time
I'’ve ever said "tootles."

1930
01:32:28,717 --> 01:32:31,850
I-I never say that.
Just so you know.

1931
01:32:32,024 --> 01:32:34,418
[Satan]
That was the first time
I said "B-T-Dubs."

1932
01:32:35,201 --> 01:32:36,333
[groans]

1933
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:45,255
[taps on glass][squawking]

1934
01:32:48,954 --> 01:32:51,217
[taps on glass][squawks]

1935
01:32:51,391 --> 01:32:52,654
Satan?

1936
01:32:52,828 --> 01:32:54,917
No, it'’s Santy Claus.
Open the window!

1937
01:32:58,398 --> 01:32:59,965
[squawks]

1938
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,447
[squawks]

1939
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:05,884
[snorts, groans]

1940
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:07,886
- Deal'’s off.
- What?

1941
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,149
The deal'’s off.
I can'’t take your soul.

1942
01:33:10,323 --> 01:33:12,848
What are you talking about?
Why is it off?

1943
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:16,068
I decided I didn'’t want it.

1944
01:33:16,242 --> 01:33:17,722
Why didn'’t you want my soul?

1945
01:33:17,896 --> 01:33:19,289
Uh...

1946
01:33:19,463 --> 01:33:21,378
Wasn'’t my type.

1947
01:33:21,552 --> 01:33:23,728
It'’s a long story.
The bottom line is,
you have your soul back

1948
01:33:23,902 --> 01:33:25,730
and you'’re never going to hell.
Sorry.

1949
01:33:25,904 --> 01:33:27,993
Wait.
If you didn'’t have my soul,

1950
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:31,083
then how was I able to
talk trash to Mr. Charles

1951
01:33:31,257 --> 01:33:33,608
and the crossing guard

1952
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:35,305
and stand up to Aiden?

1953
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:36,436
Kinda.

1954
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:39,265
That wasn'’t me.

1955
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:42,312
You were finally
standing up for yourself.

1956
01:33:42,486 --> 01:33:45,184
Though I did think you were
a little hard on Mr. Charles.

1957
01:33:45,358 --> 01:33:46,533
You thought so too?

1958
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,448
A little.

1959
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:51,147
Wait. Why would you come
all the way here
just to tell me that?

1960
01:33:51,321 --> 01:33:53,149
Um, I'’m considerate.

1961
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:55,107
Satan isn'’t considerate.

1962
01:33:55,281 --> 01:33:56,326
That'’s a stereotype.

1963
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,632
Satan can be complex.

1964
01:33:57,806 --> 01:33:59,721
I mean, I can be complex.

1965
01:34:01,287 --> 01:34:03,550
You don'’t have your--
You'’re not Satan.

1966
01:34:03,725 --> 01:34:04,726
Uh...

1967
01:34:06,118 --> 01:34:07,424
I never said I was.

1968
01:34:07,598 --> 01:34:09,426
Yes, you did.
Numerous times!

1969
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,863
[groans] Sorry.
Caught me in a lie.

1970
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,824
I knew
you weren'’t really Satan.

1971
01:34:15,998 --> 01:34:18,348
Why would Satan stay
at the Red Rum Motor Lodge?

1972
01:34:18,522 --> 01:34:20,350
They got free Wi-Fi.

1973
01:34:22,047 --> 01:34:23,483
And I like their croissants.

1974
01:34:24,963 --> 01:34:26,138
So, who are you?

1975
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:28,793
I was just a low-level demon.

1976
01:34:29,533 --> 01:34:30,577
"Demigorgon."

1977
01:34:31,448 --> 01:34:32,754
A fraud.

1978
01:34:32,928 --> 01:34:33,929
[sighs]

1979
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:36,192
So that'’s it?

1980
01:34:37,193 --> 01:34:39,238
Yep.
You get to keep your soul

1981
01:34:39,412 --> 01:34:41,371
and you'’re never
gonna go to hell.

1982
01:34:41,545 --> 01:34:44,983
And thanks to
your candy-ass wishes,
I'’m banished from hell forever.

1983
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:46,811
Oh, geez.

1984
01:34:47,856 --> 01:34:49,422
I'’m so sorry about that.
I--

1985
01:34:50,554 --> 01:34:52,425
Ah, it'’s all right.

1986
01:34:53,905 --> 01:34:56,081
Hell ain'’t all
it'’s cracked up to be.

1987
01:34:56,908 --> 01:34:57,822
[scoffs]

1988
01:34:57,996 --> 01:34:59,694
Talk about your horrible bosses.

1989
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:04,829
[sighs] Anyway, kid,
Merry Christmas.

1990
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:06,483
Thank you.

1991
01:35:06,657 --> 01:35:08,180
Merry Christmas to you too.

1992
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,184
I'’m sort of ashamed to
admit it,

1993
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:15,318
but I really enjoyed hanging out
with you
and getting to know you.

1994
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,713
You'’re a good kid, Liam.

1995
01:35:19,975 --> 01:35:21,019
Thank you.

1996
01:35:21,193 --> 01:35:22,978
You'’re very welcome.

1997
01:35:23,935 --> 01:35:25,894
And I like Emma too.
She'’s a doll.

1998
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:29,158
And Gibby... [chuckles]

1999
01:35:29,332 --> 01:35:34,163
How much fun was that seeing him
with those new teeth?
That smile.

2000
01:35:34,337 --> 01:35:36,948
Did you see that joy,
that little glimmer in his eye?

2001
01:35:37,122 --> 01:35:39,124
That kid'’s got a heart of gold.

2002
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:41,300
His old teeth, yikes.

2003
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:43,172
You could open up
a bottle of beer
on those chompers.

2004
01:35:43,346 --> 01:35:45,696
[laughs]
I mean, bottle of pop.

2005
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:50,440
So, what are you gonna do
with yourself?

2006
01:35:50,614 --> 01:35:54,270
For Christmas?
I usually order Chinese
and watch some hoops.

2007
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:57,534
No. I mean, like,
for good?

2008
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:00,015
Oh.

2009
01:36:00,189 --> 01:36:03,366
I actually feel like
I'’m starting a new chapter
of my life,

2010
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:04,976
and it'’s pretty refreshing.

2011
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:07,631
[chuckles] It'’s a totally
different career path.

2012
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:11,156
Anyhoo, I gotta go now.
[chuckles]

2013
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:12,549
Oh, yeah!

2014
01:36:12,723 --> 01:36:14,159
One more thing.

2015
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:15,900
Your third wish
was null and void.

2016
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:17,597
What? What do you mean?

2017
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,469
Don'’t ask me
about null and void.

2018
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:22,211
It'’s a legal term.
Very complicated.

2019
01:36:22,385 --> 01:36:25,997
The point is
you can'’t wish for something
that'’s already happened.

2020
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:29,871
Your parents got back together
on their own,
so that canceled out your wish.

2021
01:36:30,045 --> 01:36:32,177
- Wh-- Really?
- Really.

2022
01:36:32,351 --> 01:36:34,789
So it turns out
you had another wish coming.

2023
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:37,704
I didn'’t have much time,
so I just put in what
you asked for in your letter.

2024
01:36:37,879 --> 01:36:40,795
My letter? I thought you said
you didn'’t read it.

2025
01:36:40,969 --> 01:36:44,450
Oh, I was in the bathroom
doing my business
and I needed something.

2026
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,844
My letter.

2027
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:49,760
I didn'’t know
I could wish for that.

2028
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,719
You can wish for
anything you want, kid.

2029
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:54,765
It'’s Christmas.

2030
01:36:57,507 --> 01:36:59,117
See ya!

2031
01:37:00,553 --> 01:37:02,120
[hoots]

2032
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,299
["Holly Jolly Christmas"

2033
01:37:27,058 --> 01:37:28,146
[laughs]

2034
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,583
- Rudolph the Reindeer pastries.
- Bill!

2035
01:37:30,757 --> 01:37:34,109
Okay, first off,
it'’s Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

2036
01:37:34,283 --> 01:37:37,068
Wha--And these are actually
your all-time worst.

2037
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:39,375
- What?
- They--
They look like seals.

2038
01:37:39,549 --> 01:37:40,593
- Seals?
- Yeah.

2039
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:41,943
- No, they'’ve got antlers.
- No.

2040
01:37:42,117 --> 01:37:43,161
- They'’re anatomically correct.
- Okay.

2041
01:37:43,335 --> 01:37:45,120
[Bill] I-- Don'’t--[Molly] No.

2042
01:37:45,294 --> 01:37:47,557
[parents laughing]
Like, why are you...
I think I nailed the back.

2043
01:37:49,254 --> 01:37:51,256
[parents continue talking
indistinctly]

2044
01:37:53,215 --> 01:37:56,174
[Bill]
...nice touch, gumdrop nose...[Molly laughing]

2045
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,177
[Bill]
I think I nailed the back.

2046
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:01,571
[Liam] <i>Dear Santa.</i>

2047
01:38:03,486 --> 01:38:06,706
<i>I know it'’s ridiculous
that I'’m writing you
this letter.</i>

2048
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,579
<i>After all, I'’m 11.</i>

2049
01:38:09,753 --> 01:38:12,887
<i>But, hey,
I figure it can'’t hurt.</i>

2050
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:15,280
[laughing]

2051
01:38:16,673 --> 01:38:18,980
[Liam]
<i>I know this is
a crazy thing to ask for.</i>

2052
01:38:19,154 --> 01:38:21,330
Thank you so much.
Thank you. I just--You got it. Yeah.

2053
01:38:21,504 --> 01:38:26,683
[Liam] <i>But if anyone
is used to being asked
for crazy things, it'’s you.</i>

2054
01:38:28,076 --> 01:38:29,773
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

2055
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:34,256
- Well, look who'’s up.
- Merry Christmas, buddy.

2056
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,127
Why don'’t you go see
what Santa brought you?

2057
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:38,564
[Liam] <i>I only want
one thing for Christmas.</i>

2058
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:41,741
<i>And I'’m pretty sure</i>

2059
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,005
<i>I'’ll only want
one thing for
the rest of my life.</i>

2060
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:47,008
<i>Please, please...</i>

2061
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:50,750
<i>can you bring my brother back?</i>

2062
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:53,188
Yes!

2063
01:38:54,058 --> 01:38:55,842
[breathing heavily]

2064
01:39:01,544 --> 01:39:03,633
Hey, Liam. Merry Christmas.

2065
01:39:06,897 --> 01:39:09,987
[crying]
What are you waiting for?
Open up your presents.

2066
01:39:10,161 --> 01:39:11,162
I just did.

2067
01:39:13,469 --> 01:39:14,600
What are you doing?

2068
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,735
Mom, can you tell Liam to
stop it?

2069
01:39:18,909 --> 01:39:20,389
[Molly chuckles]

2070
01:39:20,563 --> 01:39:21,868
[sobbing]

2071
01:39:22,043 --> 01:39:23,609
I love you so much.

2072
01:39:23,783 --> 01:39:27,048
Okay, okay. I love you too.
Ma, tell him to let go of me.

2073
01:39:27,222 --> 01:39:29,659
You know how much
Liam loves Christmas, Spence.

2074
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:32,227
- Get '’em while they'’re hot!
- Oh, no.

2075
01:39:33,054 --> 01:39:34,446
- Wow.
- Chef Dad.

2076
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,926
So delicious. Thanks.

2077
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,710
- Who'’s this from?
- The Harrisons.

2078
01:39:37,884 --> 01:39:39,147
From the old neighborhood?[Molly] Yeah.

2079
01:39:39,321 --> 01:39:40,670
Yeah. I liked them.

2080
01:39:40,844 --> 01:39:42,498
They had a skating rink
in their backyard

2081
01:39:42,672 --> 01:39:43,760
and the pug who chased pucks.

2082
01:39:43,934 --> 01:39:45,762
That'’s right.
God, I miss them.

2083
01:39:45,936 --> 01:39:48,112
Remind me why
we ever left Connecticut.

2084
01:39:48,286 --> 01:39:50,593
[chuckling]
Because you wanted to move.[blusters, whinnies]

2085
01:39:50,767 --> 01:39:53,988
My pony!
- [laughing] What?
- Oh, my God.

2086
01:39:54,162 --> 01:39:55,641
I got my fricking pony!

2087
01:39:55,815 --> 01:39:58,296
Oh, my God, Bill.

2088
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:01,647
- Oh, my.
- Bill.

2089
01:40:01,821 --> 01:40:03,475
Thank you, sweetie.

2090
01:40:03,649 --> 01:40:05,390
Me? I...

2091
01:40:05,564 --> 01:40:07,740
Oh, okay. All right.
Well, I should be the one
thanking you.

2092
01:40:07,914 --> 01:40:10,352
Why didn'’t you tell me
you found the tree topper?

2093
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,745
I-I didn'’t find it.

2094
01:40:12,919 --> 01:40:15,357
Okay, yeah, right.
As if I believe you.

2095
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:20,231
Yeah. Okay. You...

2096
01:40:23,626 --> 01:40:24,844
Best Christmas ever.

2097
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,412
[electric guitar solo plays]

2098
01:40:31,938 --> 01:40:33,462
[line ringing]

2099
01:40:34,767 --> 01:40:37,161
- [Bill] It'’s fine. All right?
- Yeah. I think so.

2100
01:40:37,335 --> 01:40:38,902
Hey, Gibby. Merry Christmas.

2101
01:40:39,076 --> 01:40:40,860
[Gibby] <i>Yeah. Yeah. You too.</i>

2102
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:45,561
So, did it kick in yet,
you being with team Satan now?

2103
01:40:45,735 --> 01:40:47,519
No. Long story.

2104
01:40:47,693 --> 01:40:49,391
But everything turned out great.

2105
01:40:49,565 --> 01:40:50,783
And I got my soul back.

2106
01:40:50,957 --> 01:40:52,655
Wow.

2107
01:40:52,829 --> 01:40:53,960
Guess what.

2108
01:40:54,135 --> 01:40:56,702
Things are about to
get even better.

2109
01:40:56,876 --> 01:40:59,357
'’Cause I just convinced Emma
to give you another chance.

2110
01:40:59,531 --> 01:41:01,881
Wait. Really?
How? What did you say?

2111
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:05,363
Well, I know she'’s into
the whole sympathy thing,

2112
01:41:05,537 --> 01:41:07,583
so I told her about
your dead brother.

2113
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:11,674
Uh-oh.

2114
01:41:22,337 --> 01:41:24,078
[neighs]

2115
01:41:42,574 --> 01:41:44,098
[screeches]

2116
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,349
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

2117
01:45:05,995 --> 01:45:07,170
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

2118
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:08,998
Hold up.

2119
01:45:09,172 --> 01:45:11,609
Slow down, Lance Armstrong.

2120
01:45:11,783 --> 01:45:14,743
Oh, I do apologize.
I didn'’t realize
there were any cars coming.

2121
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:17,659
Yeah. I'’ll tell you
when there'’s no cars.

2122
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:19,269
Oh, my.

2123
01:45:23,055 --> 01:45:28,322
I must say,
I appreciate a woman who is
keen to her professional duties.

2124
01:45:28,496 --> 01:45:31,237
Now, may I be so bold
as to ask...

2125
01:45:31,412 --> 01:45:33,414
Yes?

2126
01:45:33,588 --> 01:45:35,633
What is it
you'’re doing here today?

2127
01:45:35,807 --> 01:45:38,114
I mean, do they have you
working on Christmas Day?

2128
01:45:38,288 --> 01:45:39,463
Oh.

2129
01:45:39,637 --> 01:45:41,944
No, I sorta
just showed up.

2130
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:43,902
Didn'’t have
anything else going on.

2131
01:45:44,076 --> 01:45:48,037
I actually had
nothing going on either,
so I... I don'’t know.

2132
01:45:48,211 --> 01:45:50,909
I thought I'’d just
go for a bike ride.[gasps]

2133
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:53,608
- Uh, please, go ahead.
- Right.

2134
01:45:53,782 --> 01:45:54,783
Yeah.[chuckles]

2135
01:45:54,957 --> 01:45:56,872
You wouldn'’t,
by chance, uh,

2136
01:45:57,046 --> 01:46:01,224
be interested in heading over
to the Royal Garden perhaps?

2137
01:46:01,398 --> 01:46:03,095
Eating some Chinese food.

2138
01:46:03,269 --> 01:46:04,662
Maybe watching some hoops.

2139
01:46:04,836 --> 01:46:06,838
I think they have
the best crab rangoons in town.

2140
01:46:08,318 --> 01:46:10,538
But of course--
I don'’t mean to put you out.

2141
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:13,497
You had me at "rangoons."

2142
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:15,064
Then it'’s a date.

2143
01:46:15,238 --> 01:46:16,587
Hop on, milady.

2144
01:46:17,893 --> 01:46:21,679
Second thought, uh,
how about we take a brisk walk?

2145
01:46:21,853 --> 01:46:22,680
Oh.[chuckles]

2146
01:46:22,854 --> 01:46:24,029
Shall I?Yeah.

2147
01:46:24,203 --> 01:46:25,944
- Let'’s shove off.
- Let'’s shove off.

2148
01:46:26,118 --> 01:46:27,816
You must be from England.
Are you?

2149
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:30,688
Jersey.
New Jersey, actually. Yes.

2150
01:46:30,862 --> 01:46:32,342
The Princeton area of course.

2151
01:46:32,516 --> 01:46:33,996
[crossing guard]
That explains the accent.

2152
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:35,432
[Mr. Charles]
Yes. Yes, yes.

2153
01:46:35,606 --> 01:46:36,999
[both laughing]
