3
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,162
Damn it!

4
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,336
Where is it?

5
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,681
Please, please.

6
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,329
Stop it, I want it to shut up!

7
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,465
Get out of my head.

8
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,366
You hate that school.

9
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,390
You hate any school.

10
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,512
Do you have any left, Samuel?

11
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,312
You need to take your pills, son.

12
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,940
I haven't had any in four days!

13
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,144
You can't do that, you know that, Samuel,

14
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,489
you know that, son!

15
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,899
I took my last one this morning, dad.

16
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,030
They're all gone.

17
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,454
Oh, no, every day, every day, son!

18
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,824
If you don't, look at me.

19
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,998
It'll be the end, Samuel.

20
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,670
You can't go back!

21
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,924
Oh, but don't you worry,
don't you worry, son.

22
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,924
I'm gonna find some money,
that's what I'm gonna do.

23
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,305
I'm gonna find some money,

24
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,833
and we're gonna get you some pills.

25
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,757
Don't you worry, that's what I'm gonna do.

26
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,143
I'm gonna find some money.

27
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,054
- Don't give him any.
- Go out and buy pills.

28
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,584
Where's the TV guide?

29
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,861
Come back here, I'm not done!

30
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,233
He's ignoring me.

31
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,407
This isn't happening!

32
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,325
Dad?

33
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,472
Guy's going crazy in there.

34
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,346
He hasn't come out of
that room for a week now.

35
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,835
He's got a kid in there, too!

36
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,348
Okay.

37
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,754
Two months behind on his rent.

38
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,880
I want him the hell outta here!

39
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,019
All right.

40
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,571
Dad, what are you doing?

41
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,694
Can't you see them, Samuel?

42
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,696
They're trying to destroy me,

43
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,493
but I won't let that happen.

44
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,946
See what, dad?

45
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,076
Can't you see them?

46
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:34,906
This the one?

47
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:35,786
Yeah.

48
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,242
Gimme the key.

49
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,496
- Wait over there, sir.
- All right.

50
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,050
Police, open up!

51
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,726
Get out of here and leave us alone!

52
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,987
They're here, Samuel,
they're gonna take us away.

53
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,559
- Dad.
- No, it's too late, son.

54
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,612
It's too late!

55
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,171
You get outta here or I'll throw you out.

56
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,609
Just take it easy, mister.

57
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,531
Drop the razor.

58
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,862
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

59
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,538
Easy.

60
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,988
Come here, son.

61
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,333
No!

62
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,142
Holy shit.

63
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,269
I told you to leave us alone.

64
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,622
Dad, no!

65
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,791
Stop!

66
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,719
Oh, Samuel, I'm sorry.

67
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,274
No!

68
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,172
Son, don't do it!

69
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,054
Come with me.

70
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,668
That's right, he's up there now.

71
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,252
I'm all finished, sir.

72
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,277
How ya feeling?

73
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,487
I'll be okay.

74
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,820
Still hasn't said a word.

75
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,510
I'm gonna have to take him to Chatsworth.

76
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,534
Psychiatric?

77
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,238
You saw what they did.

78
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,658
I'm not sure what I saw.

79
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,303
How are we gonna write
this up in a report?

80
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,868
I'll take care of it.

81
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,676
Just go on home and call
it a night, all right?

82
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,796
Thanks, sarge.

83
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,172
You got any relatives
or friends I could call?

84
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,820
You guys take
him to the stable now.

85
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,054
Let me know what time it is.

86
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,266
Keep it roped off upstairs.

87
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,443
Police line, no approaching.

88
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,380
I got the paperwork, Freddy.
All right.

89
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,615
You hungry?

90
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,788
He looks like he hasn't eaten for days.

91
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,213
Probably hasn't.

92
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,465
What's his name?

93
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,803
Samuel.

94
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,430
He saved my life.

95
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
Sleep tight.

96
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,439
Oh, he's adorable.

97
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,988
Don't get too attached to him, Margaret.

98
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,005
I have to take him to Chatsworth tomorrow.

99
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,113
Chatsworth, why Chatsworth?

100
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,445
I told you,
he's not like other boys.

101
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
How so?

102
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,810
Well, I'm not sure, but, whatever it is,

103
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,665
it drove his father insane.

104
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,415
He looks like
a normal little boy to me.

105
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,590
I'll be right in.

106
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,838
Try to get some sleep, son.

107
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,320
We found this at the apartment.

108
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,372
Ephemerol.

109
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,789
He had over a dozen of them, empty.

110
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,992
Do you know what this means?

111
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,497
No.

112
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,378
The boy might be one of them.

113
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,801
One of what?

114
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,254
I was right, he has an
enlarged hypothalamus.

115
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,507
- What's that?
- He's a scanner.

116
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:48,678
A scanner?

117
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,856
Years ago, a drug used to
ease the pain of pregnancy

118
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,356
was found to develop
abnormalities in the fetus.

119
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,857
Lift your shirt.

120
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,154
Those who survived developed

121
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,733
extraordinary telepathic powers.

122
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,319
They could actually read a man's mind,

123
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,664
influence his actions.

124
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,909
That's incredible.

125
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,537
Yes, but there were some
terrible side effects.

126
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,828
Because their senses are so keen,

127
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,539
most go insane from the sensory overload.

128
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,550
Well, what about the pills?

129
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,927
Ephemerol is a scanning suppressant.

130
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,804
If he takes it every day, it blocks

131
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,227
the flow of telepathy, but, if he doesn't,

132
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,429
well, you've seen the results.

133
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,983
In a few days, the degenerative
process gets irreversible.

134
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,652
He won't control himself.

135
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,690
He'll become a time
bomb, ready to explode.

136
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,035
Hey, take it easy, doc.

137
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,826
Rare and fascinating breed.

138
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,625
I can't wait to do some more
research on this subject.

139
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,702
Wait a second, what is that?

140
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,004
This is radioactive glucose.

141
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,485
It'll give us a clearer picture

142
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,420
of what's going on in his brain.

143
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,588
Easy, boy, I'm just gonna inject
you with this harmless dye.

144
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,178
Yeah, like hell you will!

145
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,222
Let's get outta this nuthouse.

146
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,183
Think of the progress I
could make in brain research.

147
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,149
Find yourself
another Guinea pig, doc.

148
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,644
That child is dangerous,
you're making a serious mistake!

149
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,534
Come on, it's bath time.

150
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,507
Damn scientists!

151
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,104
You okay?

152
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,982
He said that if you take these
pills, you're gonna be fine.

153
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:06,275
Listen, Sam, my wife and I
never had any kids of our own.

154
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,364
I don't even know whether
we'd be any good at it.

155
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,851
But what I'm trying to say
is that you can stay with us,

156
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,875
if you want.

157
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,051
All right then.

158
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,714
Let's go home.

159
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,270
Officer Samuel staziak.

160
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,202
Officer staziak, welcome to the force.

161
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,904
Thank you, sir.

162
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,458
Excuse me, I want everyone's attention.

163
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,633
I'd like to propose a toast.

164
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,507
You've worked real hard for this, son,

165
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,054
and I'm proud of you.

166
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:10,925
Hear, hear.

167
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,100
- Hear, hear.
- Congratulations.

168
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,223
Officer staziak, your first assignment

169
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,600
is to cut me a big piece of this cake.

170
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,109
Yes, sir.

171
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,974
He can do it now.

172
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,315
Congratulations, Sam.

173
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,656
Thanks, mom.

174
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,202
I'm nervous.

175
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,533
Here he goes.

176
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,371
Oh! - Yeah!

177
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,307
How's it going, Kim?

178
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,142
- Hey.
- It's pretty quiet tonight.

179
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,487
Yeah, it's Monday.

180
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,224
Hey, Kim, if you got fresh coffee,

181
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,022
we'll take two cups to go.

182
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,112
So how do you like living in the hills?

183
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,089
It's okay, it's nice, it's quiet.

184
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,051
We miss you down here.

185
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,977
I miss you, too, mom.

186
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,975
I got some laundry in the car.

187
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,446
How you doing, Jerry?

188
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:57,998
You all right?

189
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,370
Yeah, everything's okay.

190
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,776
Hey, how's it going?

191
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,483
What's up?

192
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,828
Stop!

193
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,782
Freezel

194
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,586
Harrigan.

195
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,967
Who?

196
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,257
I'll take care of it.

197
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,262
He didn't have any priors,

198
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,096
not even a parking ticket.

199
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,441
- Blood?
- Clean.

200
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,891
- Any witnesses?
- Two.

201
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,876
Both said the killers were acting strange

202
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,811
and had these crazy eyes.

203
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,592
Crazy eyes, what are we
supposed to do with that?

204
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,230
I'm putting you in charge

205
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,134
of this investigation, lieutenant brown.

206
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,114
I want full autopsies.
I'm already on it.

207
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,615
But, hey, I don't get it.

208
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,643
I mean, two regular Joes
suddenly decide to whack

209
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,158
a couple of cops, and
both on the same night?

210
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,619
Let's just hope it's a
coincidence, lieutenant.

211
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,171
Pretty fucking weird
coincidence, don't you think?

212
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,183
Front page, doctor.

213
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,982
Police officers killed
in separate incidents.

214
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,908
Commander Harrigan says that
the incidents are unrelated.

215
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,078
I'll show them unrelated.

216
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,041
What does the future hold
for the commander, zena?

217
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,378
Let's see.

218
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Death!

219
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,595
Not so soon, I think
we should play with him first.

220
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,938
Grab your gear, staziak.

221
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,950
So they stuck me with the commander's son.

222
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,623
I hope you don't expect
any special treatment.

223
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,700
- No, sir, never did.
- Good.

224
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,537
Kid, you picked one hell
of a time to be a cop.

225
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,942
So what do you say we keep you

226
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,027
from being the next statistic?

227
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,051
I'll take that.

228
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,507
What are those?

229
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,141
Vitamins.

230
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,514
Let's go.

231
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,622
Take a look out there.

232
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,040
It ain't pretty.

233
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,563
If you wanna survive these days,

234
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,997
you gotta keep your eyes open

235
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,829
and see below the surface.

236
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,254
How's that, sir?

237
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,337
It's like a sixth sense,

238
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,919
just know when something's not right.

239
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,866
Here it is, fellas, what's up?

240
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,951
- Forget it, man.
- You pay the man.

241
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,160
Look, I don't have time for this, man.

242
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,594
Where's the money?

243
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,080
- You pay him.
- Yo, I don't have time

244
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,224
for this, where's the money?

245
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:31,806
How about a free week?

246
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,148
Come on, free?

247
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,232
Move, move!

248
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,878
All right, hold
it right there, eightball.

249
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,982
Hey, Riley,
how you doing there, buddy?

250
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,314
Long time no see.

251
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,112
Nice of you to ask, eightball.

252
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:42,984
Yeah.

253
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,610
Been a while, huh? Turn around.

254
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,362
Sir... turn around!

255
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,444
On your knees, hands behind your head.

256
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,995
What's the problem?

257
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,448
Officer staziak, good of you to join me.

258
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,063
- What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

259
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,732
Riley, look, man, you know
me, I'm just hanging out.

260
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,290
You can't arrest me for that.

261
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,837
Shut up, scumbag.

262
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,712
Officer staziak, open that
trashcan and look inside.

263
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,337
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,260
Whoa, what do we got, new job?

265
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,783
It's my financial aid, Riley.

266
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,015
Hey, I'm in school, man,
you'd be proud, you know?

267
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:10,841
I'm straight, man, I'm telling you.

268
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:11,676
Got it.

269
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,021
Got what?

270
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,470
Riley, you set me up, man,

271
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,134
what's up?
I told you to shut up.

272
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,192
Hanging out, huh?

273
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,015
You're gonna doing a lot of hanging out

274
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
where I'm taking you.

275
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,647
- Man, I got rights!
- What'd I say?

276
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,651
Welcome to the neighborhood.

277
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,290
I'm back for some of
that good coffee, Karen.

278
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,195
The doctor will be with
you in just a moment.

279
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,254
Thanks.

280
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,346
Hey, doc, got time
for another gangbanger,

281
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,298
or should I staple him up myself?

282
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,728
Sit him down.

283
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,522
So, how's business, doc?

284
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,395
They keeping you jumping?

285
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,444
Doc!

286
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,120
Harrigan.

287
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,039
Pete, yeah, it looks like
we got another coincidence.

288
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,094
Where?

289
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,168
- County hospital.
- I'll be right there.

290
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,125
He snapped, just like the others.

291
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,704
The only thing they have in common

292
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,014
is they all come into
frequent contact with cops.

293
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,836
- Like a million other people.
- Yeah.

294
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,383
And, look, I got this for you, too.

295
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,442
What is it?

296
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,652
We found it on him.

297
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,862
Look at the other side.

298
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,563
"Unrelated commander."

299
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,942
There's one guy doing this. Yep.

300
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,824
- Get it to the lab.
- You got it.

301
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,035
He's in a complete state of catatonia.

302
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,376
Why?

303
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
I don't know.

304
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,295
No alcohol, no drugs, nothing.

305
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,339
Look, doctor, I need answers quickly.

306
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,338
My men are dying out there.

307
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,420
I will do my best, commander.

308
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,266
But I can't read the man's mind.

309
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,521
What about that car?

310
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,232
Two male whites, 25 to 30.

311
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,571
One, black jacket, the
other, a green t-shirt.

312
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,656
License, 5-2-4-Nora-zebra-king.

313
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,336
No hits.

314
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,879
You're learning quick, kid.

315
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,006
Let's go.

316
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,344
Where we going?

317
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,845
To check out the place
where eightball works.

318
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,138
Okay, you're clear.

319
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,571
Afternoon.

320
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,615
Can I help you guys?

321
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,566
Yeah, pretty hot outside today.

322
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,388
My partner and I thought we'd cool off

323
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,618
in here for a while.

324
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,039
Yeah, not without a warrant.

325
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,376
A warrant?

326
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,825
Now why would we need a warrant

327
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,832
to cool our heels in a
place that makes ice, huh?

328
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,131
Hey, hey, don't touch that.

329
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,427
Hey, partner, they
got snow in their ice.

330
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,536
Look out!

331
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,798
Staziak?

332
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,476
See you downtown.

333
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,022
Thanks, Dakota.

334
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,475
Yeah, good night.

335
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,069
Bring him over, here you go.

336
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,771
Watch your head.

337
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,116
More vitamins?

338
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,393
Forgot to take them this morning.

339
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,178
You're gonna take 'em down, huh?

340
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:39,985
Yeah.

341
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,819
Come straight with me, staziak.

342
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,525
What the hell happened back there?

343
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,417
Forget about it.

344
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,285
What I saw wasn't normal.

345
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,540
Then keep it to yourself, okay, partner?

346
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,383
19-a-12, come in.

347
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,758
All right, I ain't gonna
argue with the commander's son.

348
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,142
Thanks, Mike.

349
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,304
19-a-12, go.

350
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,071
19-a-12, return to the station.

351
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,310
Have officer staziak report
to captain dodd, code two.

352
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,188
Roger, on the way.

353
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,864
Wonder what the captain wants with me.

354
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,707
Pete, I mean, commander.

355
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,161
Jim, can you excuse
us for a moment, thanks.

356
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,216
Have a seat.

357
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,468
Sir?

358
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,838
Forget the formalities.

359
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,215
Sam, I got a big problem,
and I need your help.

360
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,559
Anything.

361
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,051
Well, it's this cop killing case.

362
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,516
Police officers are being
killed by ordinary citizens,

363
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,896
and we don't know why.

364
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,914
What does the one in
custody have to say?

365
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,230
Nothing, he's catatonic.

366
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,486
I got a shrink working with him,

367
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,272
but she's coming up with nothing.

368
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,629
Sam, I never thought I'd
have to ask you this,

369
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,284
but you're the only one that can come up

370
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,411
with what's going on inside of his head.

371
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,835
You want me to scan him?

372
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,049
That means not taking my pills.

373
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,257
Why are you asking me to do this, Pete?

374
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,091
You saw what happened to my father.

375
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,436
I know.

376
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,277
But it would just be for
a short period of time.

377
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,355
We'll be very careful, Sam.

378
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,605
Please, more cops may be murdered.

379
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,403
With your help, we might be
able to save their lives.

380
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,533
I'm sorry, Pete.

381
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,995
I'm really sorry, I hope
you understand, but.

382
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,430
You're right, son.

383
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,093
Forgive me for asking.

384
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,311
Is that all?

385
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,439
Yes.

386
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,830
Mr. Jones!

387
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,122
Hi, Mr. Jones.

388
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,584
Don't worry, it's a harmless neuroblocker.

389
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,628
You'll be okay in a couple of hours.

390
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,008
So what do you want from me?

391
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,805
Zena tells me that you're a Vietnam vet.

392
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,726
You had terrible experiences
there, didn't you?

393
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,485
Proceed, zena.

394
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,736
I've got a little surprise
for your boss Harrigan.

395
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,738
When you see this uniform, Mr. Jones,

396
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,445
you will relive the horrors of your past.

397
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,905
What is that, no, no!

398
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,530
Don't you... no, no, no, no, no,

399
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,706
relax, Mr. Jones.

400
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:20,047
I've done this many times before.

401
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,124
Morning, officer.

402
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,148
Morning, sir.

403
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,393
So what brought your old
man down here yesterday?

404
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,069
I'd rather not talk about it.

405
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,690
We got a golden rule around here.

406
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,696
No fucking secrets from your partner.

407
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,662
He wants me on the cop killing case.

408
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,912
It's my towel, pal.

409
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,082
Listen, Sam, the
commander's a smart man.

410
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,069
He asked you to be part
of that investigation

411
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,549
because he believes you can help.

412
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,337
You know we got
that game over there.

413
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,299
You don't understand.

414
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,677
Damn right I don't understand.

415
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,579
Would you just let your buddies get killed

416
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,515
when you can do something about it?

417
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,457
Hey, Marvin, see the fight last night?

418
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,193
Halt!

419
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,494
Look out!

420
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,042
It's okay, it's okay.

421
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,556
It's okay.

422
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,517
Mike.

423
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,188
Mike?

424
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,609
Commander, what's wrong?

425
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,187
76 was just hit.

426
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,773
Two officers dead, one wounded.

427
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:11,946
What, right in the station?

428
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,405
Yeah.

429
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,663
It's Marvin Jones, he was a
janitor there for 12 years.

430
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,703
Son of a bitch.

431
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,535
What about Sam, is he all right?

432
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,715
Sam's okay.

433
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,594
Who the hell is doing this?

434
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,105
Okay.

435
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,482
Go ahead.

436
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,027
Command set up.

437
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,330
Are we up?

438
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,780
Not just yet, sir.

439
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,394
How much longer til
we're up and running?

440
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,418
30 minutes.

441
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,661
I want security posted at every station.

442
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,494
You got it.

443
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Sergeant.

444
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,047
Excuse me, commander.

445
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,010
Sam.

446
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,093
Where's the intern?

447
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:15,926
Thank you.

448
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,428
What are you talking about?

449
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,058
I'll explain on the way, let's go.

450
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,338
That's no problem at alll.

451
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,736
Dr. Alden, can I talk with you?

452
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,073
Commander.

453
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,819
Get him out of herel

454
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,165
I'll explain later.

455
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,714
What was that about?

456
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
I don't know.

457
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,091
Commander?

458
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:51,924
It's the uniform.

459
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,504
Damon Pratt has been programmed
to kill cops in uniform.

460
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,511
My bet is it's the same
with the other two killers.

461
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,344
You mean brainwashed?

462
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,892
Essentially, yes.

463
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,807
So how do we stop 'em?

464
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,061
For starters, I suggest
we eliminate the trigger.

465
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,310
Order your men out of uniform.

466
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,135
Come on, doctor, I can't put my men

467
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,967
into plain clothes based on your hunch.

468
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,779
You've been reading
too much Sci-Fi, doc.

469
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,444
Oh, and what do you
propose to do, lieutenant?

470
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,448
Sam.

471
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,826
I'd like you to meet
officer Samuel staziak.

472
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,836
Hi.

473
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,714
Hi.

474
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,631
This is not proper procedure.

475
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,959
Even if officer staziak is a scanner,

476
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,011
he may cause irreparable
damage to the subject.

477
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,385
Who's gonna be responsible
if that happens?

478
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,011
If it happens?

479
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,719
The guy has cottage cheese for brains.

480
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,180
You said it yourself,
doctor, he's unreachable.

481
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,560
I'm ready.

482
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,190
This is bullshit.

483
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,695
Excuse me, lieutenant,
but this isn't bullshit.

484
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,806
Something's happening.

485
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,599
What's going on?

486
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,102
I think he's made a
telepathic connection.

487
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,233
Are you okay?

488
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,199
So, how's business, doc?

489
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,079
Doc, hey, doc.

490
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,836
Oh my god.

491
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,177
Sam, what is it?

492
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,218
I need some water.

493
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,563
Sam?

494
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:09,978
Doctor!

495
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,511
Sam?

496
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,381
I'll be right out.

497
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,765
Are you all right, Sam?

498
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,816
What happened with Damon?

499
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,403
I saw fragments of
what was in Pratt's mind.

500
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,160
Bits and pieces of his memory.

501
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,077
He was in the emergency room

502
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,660
and officer dooley came
in with a gangbanger

503
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:18,798
and Pratt saw him and
started hallucinating.

504
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:24,884
Dooley changed form into some
kind of creature or something.

505
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,469
This is unbelievable.

506
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,472
What are you on, staziak?

507
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,356
What's the point?

508
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,565
Brown!

509
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,443
I believe you, Sam.

510
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,723
Then I grabbed the scalpel and I-

511
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,193
- you grabbed a scalpel?

512
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,445
Pratt grabbed the scalpel, okay, Pratt!

513
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,789
Pratt.

514
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:55,377
And he attacked dooley,
except it wasn't dooley,

515
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,998
it was Pratt's hallucination.

516
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,721
Code 42.

517
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,344
Oh no, it's Pratt.

518
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,151
No pulse.

519
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,062
He's gone.

520
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,235
What, what is it with you people?

521
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,253
We're supposed to feel sorry for this guy?

522
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,564
He stabbed dooley to death!

523
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,820
Are you finished, lieutenant?

524
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,762
Dr. Alden, you take care of the autopsy.

525
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,370
You set up a video link
for the whole division.

526
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,744
First thing tomorrow,
I wanna talk to my men.

527
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Sam.

528
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,174
I won't ask you to scan again.

529
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,393
I'm fine, really.

530
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,885
I'd like to stay on the case.

531
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,858
All right.

532
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,370
You get some rest, and
I'll see you tomorrow.

533
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,738
Okay.

534
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:20,756
No!

535
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,043
Oh, god, please, don't hurt me!

536
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,625
Give me the money, all
I want is your money.

537
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,970
Give it up!

538
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,129
Take it, take it!

539
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,516
What is this shit?

540
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,771
Where's your money?

541
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,422
Right here, just take it.

542
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,517
Give it to me!

543
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,439
- There's nothing in here.
- Shit!

544
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,101
What the hell you doing, huh?

545
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,446
What are you doing?

546
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:46,907
Police, freeze!

547
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,191
Shoot him, shoot him!

548
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,866
I can't, I can't move my arm.

549
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,915
I'll take him myself.

550
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,792
I know what you're thinking, pal.

551
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,669
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

552
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,966
Dumb shit.

553
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,465
Call me that again and
I'll take it personal.

554
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,515
Now, drop your weapon.

555
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,180
Get down on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

556
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,854
How did you do that?

557
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,070
Power of suggestion.

558
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,612
Mason, yeah!

559
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,593
Come on, let's go, guys!

560
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,824
Come on, Tony, move, move, move!

561
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,188
I gotta control this.

562
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,449
Attention,
all department personnel,

563
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,674
in a moment, commander
Harrigan will be speaking

564
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,619
to you over closed circuit broadcast.

565
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,296
Please, stand by.

566
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,466
In response to recent
attacks on police officers,

567
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,920
the city is on tactical
alert until further notice.

568
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,925
No civilians are to be allowed access

569
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,723
to the stations or police installations.

570
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,427
Vacations and days off have been canceled.

571
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,639
Also, effective immediately,
all uniformed officers

572
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,558
will only wear civilian
clothing while on duty.

573
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:39,032
Oh, poor Harrigan.

574
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,003
We finally made it to plain clothes.

575
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,913
I knew we would, yeah.

576
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,252
I want you all to be extremely careful,

577
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,927
consider everyone a suspect.

578
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,932
That's all.

579
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,264
And cut,
okay, thank you, people.

580
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,219
I just hope that'll buy us some time.

581
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,565
Oh, you did a good job.

582
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,731
Officer staziak, I heard about

583
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,605
that bust you made last night, good job.

584
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,686
Thanks, Pete, beginner's luck.

585
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,176
How you feeling today, huh?

586
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Okay, for now.

587
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,742
Okay, lieutenant brown, fill him in.

588
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,781
Well, where do you wanna start?

589
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,912
With some good old
fashioned police work.

590
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,253
Come on.

591
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,874
The case file, staziak, take a look at it.

592
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,755
I'll go get the coffee.

593
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,096
With cream.

594
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,723
Please.

595
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,423
Posterior to the tympanic membrane.

596
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,555
Microscopic puncture, you're right.

597
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,228
Officer staziak said he
felt a pain in his ear.

598
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,890
We oughta check this out.

599
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,991
You already read these, staziak?

600
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,364
Yeah, thanks.

601
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,225
The reports mention evidence you found

602
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,739
on the intern Pratt.

603
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,369
Yeah, it's right over there.

604
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,398
Come off it, don't tell
me you're gonna try

605
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,378
that psychic stuff on the evidence.

606
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,907
Go ahead, open it, it's been dusted.

607
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,136
No prints were found.

608
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,722
What is it?

609
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,097
It's what Damon saw.

610
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,140
His hallucinations.
Lieutenant brown,

611
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,264
officer staziak, commander Harrigan

612
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,561
wants you to meet him at county pathology.

613
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,859
We're here live in front
of police headquarters,

614
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,438
where we've just discovered
that commander Harrigan

615
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,659
has issued a peculiar
order in apparent response

616
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,238
to the rash of attacks
on local police officers.

617
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,737
For an unspecified time,
all uniformed officers

618
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,990
have been ordered to report
to duty in plain clothes.

619
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,993
This is Brenda carothers,
channel one news.

620
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,541
Well, well, well, well, well.

621
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,250
Clothes do not make the man now, do they?

622
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:40,083
An extremely high dose of
a hallucinogenic compound

623
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,089
was injected into his brain.

624
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,532
What does this substance do?

625
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,262
Hallucinogens are known to make the mind

626
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,306
open to suggestion.

627
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,928
During that critical period,

628
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,762
these men were imprinted
with the command to kill.

629
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,227
Manchurian candidate.

630
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,025
Exactly, programmed assassins.

631
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,477
That can't be true.

632
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,187
I thought so, too.

633
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,614
Studies have proven you
can't make a man kill.

634
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,535
Unless he thinks he's
killing something else.

635
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,321
That's what I tried to
explain to you yesterday

636
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,666
after I scanned him.

637
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,953
This is what Damon saw.

638
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,499
I found it in the evidence file.

639
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,335
He thought he was gonna kill it.

640
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,349
Wanna know your future?

641
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,432
Okay, all right, thank you.

642
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,391
Lieutenant, can I get you anything?

643
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,021
- No.
- Good night.

644
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:41,947
Did you get anything?

645
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,188
Nope.

646
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,801
The manufacturer says they've sold

647
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,032
over a thousand decks of
this particular tarot card

648
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,610
in Los Angeles alone.

649
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,705
Only in la.

650
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,248
Looks like the order's
working, lieutenant.

651
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,124
Yeah, for now.

652
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,669
Look, why don't we just call it a night,

653
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,214
and get a fresh start in the morning, huh?

654
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,551
Okay.

655
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,380
Can I buy you dinner, officer?

656
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,467
I've got a gun, we'll eat for free.

657
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,565
Great.

658
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,540
See you tomorrow, detective.

659
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,458
Okay, pick you up at eight.

660
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,092
Don't be late.

661
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,362
Hey, sweetie.

662
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,820
Guess what, I'm gonna be in plain clothes,

663
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,323
at least for a little while.

664
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,534
Mm, that smells good.

665
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:18,877
Are you all right?

666
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,339
Yeah.

667
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:24,756
You don't sound so good.

668
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,919
Maybe this will make you feel better.

669
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,095
Please, not now, honey.

670
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,548
Come on, babe.

671
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,010
Don't make me have to
put you under arrest.

672
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,732
All right, lady, you asked for it.

673
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,105
Up against the wall.

674
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,026
Drop it.

675
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:06,622
Thank you.

676
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,737
You know, if the side
effects were eliminated,

677
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,093
your ability could be a
real asset in my profession.

678
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,469
Not interested.

679
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,387
As soon as this is over, I wanna

680
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,555
just forget about it, okay, doctor?

681
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,144
Joan.

682
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,392
How about some dessert?

683
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,141
Sorry.

684
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,107
Here, you can have it.

685
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,540
Thank you.

686
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,208
Sam, thank you.

687
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,627
But you should conserve your energy.

688
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,730
Do you want...

689
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,151
Sam, what's wrong?

690
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,692
Just a little headache.

691
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,192
When did you last take your pills?

692
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,899
Couple of days ago.

693
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,404
Sam, I don't wanna lecture-

694
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,537
- shh.

695
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,908
Let's just eat.

696
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,200
Come on, hurry up, get your pants on.

697
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,153
We're gonna be late for roll call.

698
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,006
Rick!

699
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:50,922
Rick!

700
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,050
Rick!

701
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:01,933
My god.

702
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,115
You look like hell.

703
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,538
So do you, dad.

704
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,913
Where is she?

705
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,250
Inside.

706
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,375
Hey, you guys are
gonna need one of these.

707
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,214
Smells like hell in there.

708
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,171
How long has it been?

709
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,503
Maybe 14 hours, but an oven was left on,

710
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,263
and you know what heat will do.

711
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,330
Listen, I want you to come and see me,

712
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,639
and we'll talk, okay? - Okay.

713
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,823
Where's his wife?

714
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:01,983
In the garage.

715
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,768
It's the only place you can breathe.

716
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,120
Okay, we're set up, okay.

717
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,713
Sarah, I'm Dr. Alden.

718
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,966
You're gonna be okay.

719
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,597
We're just gonna run a test.

720
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,065
Hi, Sarah.

721
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,731
Hi, my name's Sam.

722
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,986
I'm here to help.

723
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:40,942
Are you ready, doctor?

724
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,285
All set.

725
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,663
Okay, let's see what we can find.

726
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:13,096
All right,
lady, you asked for it.

727
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
Up against the wall.

728
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,400
The badge, kopek's badge
caused her to hallucinate.

729
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,736
Badge?

730
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,787
They've changed the trigger.

731
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,161
I can't put my men on
the street without badges.

732
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,082
She's reliving the attack.

733
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,928
Over and over again.

734
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,469
She sees him as an insect, a huge insect.

735
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,141
It's all right, Sarah.

736
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,438
Let's go back, okay?

737
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,311
I need you to go back to
what happened yesterday.

738
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:06,490
I wanna know who did this to you.

739
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,039
Come, Sarah.

740
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,133
Come with me.

741
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,298
I'm in a small, dark room.

742
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,721
Frightened of insects, my dear?

743
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,946
What is it, what is it?

744
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,322
She's being imprinted.

745
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,291
Who did this to you, Sarah?

746
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,720
Come on.

747
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,269
Show me his face.

748
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,189
Just look at him.

749
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:23,903
She's hemorrhaging.

750
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:24,730
Come on, Sarah.

751
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,072
Sam, stop!

752
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,362
We gotta get her to a hospital.

753
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,243
I was almost there, why did you stop me?

754
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,778
Let them through, please.

755
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:47,917
I almost saw his face.

756
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,468
He's in Sarah's memory.

757
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,924
I've gotta scan her again.

758
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,507
You're not going anywhere near her.

759
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,808
Commander, can I speak
to you for a moment?

760
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,813
He could've killed her.

761
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:02,639
But he didn't.

762
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,145
Only because I stopped him.

763
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,393
He's beginning to lose control.

764
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,023
He needs ephemerol.

765
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,192
All right.

766
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,495
Sam-

767
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,865
- I'm not losing control!

768
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,792
Sam, listen.

769
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,126
I saw where Sarah went
the day she was imprinted.

770
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,551
If I can retrace her steps-

771
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,338
- you're running out of time, Sam.

772
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:36,924
And I don't wanna lose you.

773
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,386
Just give me another day, one more day.

774
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,891
That's all I'm asking, Pete.

775
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,266
No, not til the coroner leaves.

776
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,221
What are we running to now?

777
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:49,940
15 minutes?

778
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
You got it.

779
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,227
More cops may be murdered.

780
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,163
With your help, we might be
able to save their lives.

781
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,271
Their senses are so keen,

782
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,093
most go insane from sensory overload.

783
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,562
You're running out of time, Sam.

784
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,234
And I don't wanna lose you.

785
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,711
If he takes it every day,

786
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,361
it blocks the flow of telepathy.

787
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,118
If he doesn't, well,
you've seen the results.

788
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,528
He's beginning to lose control.

789
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,654
That child is dangerous!

790
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,051
You're making a serious mistake!

791
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,812
Come, Sarah, come with me.

792
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,994
Come, Sarah, come with me.

793
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,012
What's this cop doing here?

794
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,766
What do you want from me?

795
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,975
Man, what'd he do with my stuff?

796
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,934
I gotta find my stuff!

797
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,272
The universe is expanding.

798
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,027
Oh, I have to get there.

799
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,971
Welcome to your future.

800
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,152
You've had a rough childhood.

801
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,196
Orphaned at a young age, were you not?

802
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,277
Yes.

803
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,860
I sense a serious bout with evil.

804
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,866
You may or you may not survive.

805
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,623
If you do, you'll live a
long and fruitful life.

806
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,504
I see.

807
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,503
What is it you do for a living?

808
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,382
I'm a contractor.

809
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,386
Hmm, a career change will soon occur,

810
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,263
possibly into law enforcement.

811
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,161
What are you doing?

812
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,574
You are very powerful.

813
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,999
Sarah kopek, I don't know
what you're talking about.

814
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,002
All right, she was here.

815
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,459
I told her fortune, and then she left.

816
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,340
- You're lying.
- No!

817
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:43,841
Stop!

818
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,555
Your session is over.

819
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,399
Keep the change.

820
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,737
- Who is he?
- He's a cop,

821
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,869
and he has incredible psychic power.

822
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,830
Interesting.

823
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,566
We're gonna have to
find out more about him

824
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,296
then won't we, my dear?

825
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,884
- Cheeks?
- Thinner.

826
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,408
How's that?

827
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,138
He had a scar across his forehead.

828
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,223
Okay.

829
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,561
More like this?

830
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,562
The right side of his face looked flat,

831
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,083
like he had some paralysis or something.

832
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,854
No, not fat, flat.

833
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,818
Isn't there some faster way to do this?

834
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,774
If I don't feed Betty an image,

835
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,236
she won't know what suspect
to pull up, now will she?

836
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,367
- Excuse me.
- Hey, what?

837
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:56,879
Hello, Betty.

838
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,792
My name is Sam.

839
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,924
Let's talk.

840
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,497
Would someone mind telling me

841
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,886
what the heck is going... shh.

842
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:46,679
This is the man.

843
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,509
- Glock.
- I don't believe it.

844
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:50,338
You know him?

845
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,970
Yeah, I knew him, six years ago.

846
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,185
Karl glock was a doctor.

847
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,809
A neurosurgeon, to be more precise.

848
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,765
Successful and well-respected, at first,

849
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,463
until he was fired by the hospital

850
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,194
for conducting unauthorized
brain experiments.

851
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,488
He lost his license and disappeared.

852
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,095
Then we got a tip that he was holed up

853
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,952
in red rock canyon, kidnapping
unsuspecting teenagers,

854
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,363
testing them with drugs
and god knows what else.

855
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,994
This will open up your minds,

856
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,752
enable you to understand
my teachings better,

857
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,748
and unite us against all
those who don't believe.

858
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:25,673
We were ordered to take him out

859
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,592
by whatever means necessary.

860
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:35,394
Doctor!

861
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,345
Freeze, get down on the floor!

862
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,568
- Go, go!
- This way!

863
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,527
Jump back, move, move!

864
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,508
Hold it!

865
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,503
Could've killed
him when we had the chance.

866
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,671
Says here he's supposed to be serving

867
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,357
a life sentence at
Chatsworth mental institute.

868
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,058
No, he escaped about a year ago,

869
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,028
never been found, til now.

870
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,568
Harry, get a SWAT team together.

871
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:35,931
We're gonna take this guy out for good.

872
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:36,535
Yes, sir.

873
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,079
Sam.

874
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,701
Huh?

875
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,375
I'm proud of you,
son, you did a good job.

876
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,543
Go home and take your medication.

877
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,496
It's not over yet, Pete.

878
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,422
This guy is after you.

879
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,250
There's no way I'm leaving you alone.

880
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,104
Positions, wait for the signal, go!

881
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,829
Positions!

882
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,284
Come on, wait, wait.

883
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,114
We don't know what he's got in there,

884
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,459
so let's be real careful.

885
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,462
Go!

886
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,427
Move out, go!

887
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,643
Code four, lieutenant, the place is empty.

888
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,774
Hold it.

889
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,526
Son of a bitch!

890
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,095
Put out a teletype, lieutenant.

891
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,734
I want this bastard found.

892
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,616
Good operation, men, we just missed him.

893
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,893
Dr. Alden, I want you to
go to Chatsworth institute,

894
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,311
and see if you can come up with some clues

895
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,666
as to what glock's up to.

896
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,164
- Yes, sir.
- What is it, son?

897
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,884
You did everything you could.

898
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,133
Doc, will you give my son a ride home?

899
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,340
He needs rest and ephemerol.

900
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,112
Coffee?

901
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,697
Drink it at your own risk.

902
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,744
Sam, you've gone three
days without your ephemerol.

903
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,950
You look like you're
reaching your threshold.

904
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,208
I want you to take these.

905
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,629
No.

906
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,423
Sam, I want you... no!

907
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,420
I'm going with you tomorrow to Chatsworth.

908
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:05,844
I'm sorry, I've already lost one father.

909
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,071
All right, but then
I'm staying the night.

910
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,116
On the couch.

911
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,246
Try not to dream too loud.

912
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:44,973
Hey!

913
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:51,439
Now, would you like some
assistance, lieutenant?

914
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,112
Where are they?

915
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,449
All empty!

916
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,683
Where are they?

917
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,060
Got any more days?

918
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,143
You can't do that.

919
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,168
You know that, Samuel, you know that, son!

920
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,361
Day, every day.

921
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,867
If you don't, look at me.

922
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,639
Sam, can't you see them, son?

923
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,095
They're trying to destroy me.

924
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,193
No!

925
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,030
Sam?

926
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,240
Sam?

927
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,615
Are you all right?

928
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:29,956
I'm okay.

929
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:14,751
A scanner.

930
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,916
Dr. krench used to talk about them.

931
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,257
Fascinating.

932
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,297
And he's the commander's son.

933
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:32,475
This is getting interesting.

934
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,234
The bullet blew off his skull

935
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,364
like it was baseball cap.

936
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,571
We replaced it with a titanium plate.

937
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:55,952
Was the surgery done here?

938
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:57,454
Yes.

939
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,790
20% of his brain was damaged.

940
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,746
Yet, slowly but surely, he recovered.

941
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,091
It was amazing.

942
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,089
The doctor was fascinated by
glock's intellect and charm.

943
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,715
He had the ability to get people

944
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,216
to do whatever he wanted.

945
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,474
He convinced Dr. krench
that walks outdoors

946
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,347
would be good for him.

947
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,680
They became fast friends,
talking incessantly

948
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,561
about advances in neurology.

949
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:24,815
One day, we found Dr. krench, sitting

950
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:28,899
by himself in the garden, murdered.

951
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:33,747
Glock was gone.

952
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:39,876
Did he ever have visitors,
like friends or a relative?

953
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,086
As a matter of fact, there was one.

954
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,667
An odd, yet attractive, woman
used to visit him regularly.

955
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,593
I think her name was-

956
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,506
- zena?
- Yes, that's her.

957
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,591
Do you have any information on her,

958
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:02,186
like maybe where she lived?

959
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,476
An address? - No, I'm sorry.

960
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,152
We have no record of that.

961
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,413
Thanks, thanks, doctor.

962
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:20,794
Thanks for your time.

963
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,748
Listen, I've gotta head down to the lab.

964
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,228
Hey, brown, hold the elevator.

965
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,190
Okay, I'll meet you upstairs.

966
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,119
God.

967
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:58,999
I'm a police officer!

968
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,746
Come in.

969
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,074
Where have you been, lieutenant?

970
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,859
I've been looking for you for hours.

971
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:50,634
Harry?

972
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,342
Harry, what's wrong?

973
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:06,813
Let's go!

974
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,151
This way!

975
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,155
Harry.

976
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,484
Don't, it's me, Pete.

977
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,072
Brown, stop!

978
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,699
Drop your weapon.

979
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:28,838
Dad.

980
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,213
It's okay, dad.

981
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,960
I got it, I got it.

982
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,587
Call an ambulance!

983
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,295
Dad, it's okay, dad.

984
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,641
Oh, god.

985
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,108
I can't stand this.

986
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,506
Sam, can I talk
to you for a minute?

987
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,083
Why?

988
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,161
Now.

989
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,711
Sam, look at yourself.

990
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,047
You can't go on like this.

991
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,590
Well, I'm not quitting.

992
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,141
Not until this is over!

993
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,513
Not until this is over?

994
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,601
You may not have that long.

995
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,899
Harrigan's still alive.

996
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,244
I don't know.

997
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,515
Are you listening to me?

998
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,198
Shh!

999
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,220
Our little puppet couldn't do the trick.

1000
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,832
He's at county hospital, well guarded.

1001
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,540
The scanner saved him.

1002
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,041
- What is it?
- Shh!

1003
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,417
What do I do?

1004
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,462
Sam, where are you...

1005
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:06,853
Oh, shit!

1006
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,823
Where is he?

1007
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:25,737
I'll see you in hell.

1008
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,242
I'm not through with you.

1009
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,068
Stop!

1010
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,733
Zenal

1011
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:39,811
here.

1012
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,049
What do you want from me, Sam?

1013
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,638
You know what I want, zena!

1014
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:27,577
Come.

1015
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,070
Follow me to your destiny.

1016
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,415
Where's glock?

1017
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,349
Sam.

1018
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,227
Fuck me, Sam.

1019
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,453
How do you like it here, officer staziak?

1020
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:21,413
It's where you belong.

1021
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,269
I want glock!

1022
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,651
Well, he's where he's always been, Sam.

1023
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,687
With me, under my wing.

1024
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,704
He's at the parlor.

1025
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,420
He's still at the parlor.

1026
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,178
You're back, scanner?

1027
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,347
I've been waiting for you.

1028
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,264
You shouldn't have scanned me, Sam.

1029
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,271
I was on my way to hell.

1030
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,398
Now, you will take my place.

1031
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,482
Oh, and I can't wait to take a man's body!

1032
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,113
You're not going anywhere.

1033
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:34,660
Oh, but I must!

1034
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,996
Dr. glock needs me, sorry.

1035
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,132
What are you doing?

1036
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:44,899
Sam.

1037
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,474
I know where he is.

1038
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,820
Who?

1039
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,107
You stay here with my dad.

1040
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,117
No, wait!

1041
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:00,957
Thanks.

1042
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:39,715
Welcome, scanner,
nice of you to drop in.

1043
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,055
Shh, shh, shh.

1044
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,433
I trust you're comfortable.

1045
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,069
What did you do with my zena?

1046
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:02,860
Last time I saw her, she was in hell.

1047
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:06,832
In hell.

1048
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:13,875
An unfortunate casualty,
but it brought you here.

1049
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:19,126
Now ['ve got a special assignment
for you, officer staziak.

1050
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:26,727
I'll never do it.

1051
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,053
Oh, yes, you will, officer.

1052
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,390
A scanner's mind should be quite
receptive to my techniques,

1053
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:37,023
so why don't you just sit back,
relax, and enjoy the show.

1054
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,358
Afraid of doctors?

1055
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:44,033
Isn't it ironic that my friend Harrigan

1056
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,113
is going to, shall we say, be terminated

1057
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,286
by his own son?

1058
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,120
What sweet revenge.

1059
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,602
Stop it, stop!

1060
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:15,599
You stay here and rot!

1061
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:17,810
I'll get Harrigan myself.

1062
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:20,005
I believe this operation
calls for a specialist.

1063
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,557
What's going on, where is everybody?

1064
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:42,898
He's in the operating room.

1065
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,864
Sam, what happened, where have you been?

1066
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:53,072
I found glock, but he got away.

1067
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:55,501
What's going on.

1068
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,706
His condition stabilized,
we decided to operate.

1069
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:03,753
He's going to be all right.

1070
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:05,094
100 over 60.

1071
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,719
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

1072
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,056
14.

1073
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,225
Scalpel.

1074
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,364
It's glock!

1075
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,111
Are you okay, doctor?

1076
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,125
He's not a surgeon!

1077
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,041
Say goodbye to papa.

1078
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,378
My god!

1079
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,614
You can't scan me, Sam.

1080
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,246
Is he okay?

1081
01:28:58,542 --> 01:28:59,542
Is he gonna be okay?

1082
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,549
Oh my god!

1083
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,200
Mom, Joan.

1084
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:33,636
We got him.

1085
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:57,900
What are those, sir?

1086
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,244
Vitamins.

1087
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:03,749
Is today your first day?

1088
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,285
Yes, sir.

1089
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:06,995
- You nervous?
- A little, sir.

1090
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:12,631
It's okay, grab your
gear, let's go, partner.

1091
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:14,048
Yes, sir.
