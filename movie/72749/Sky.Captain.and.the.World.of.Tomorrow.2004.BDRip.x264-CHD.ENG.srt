1
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:10,803
<i>Attention. Please prepare
for docking procedure.</i>

2
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,543
<i>There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.</i>

3
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,552
They didn't leave a name.

4
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,658
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

5
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,358
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

6
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,261
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

7
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,497
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

8
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:31,346
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

9
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,174
You don't like my smile?

10
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,748
I don't like what's behind it.

11
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,813
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

12
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:44,891
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

13
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,263
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

14
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,197
I'll bring you some popcorn.

15
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,131
<i>Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

16
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>We must be over the rainbow.</i>

17
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,075
You sent me this?

18
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,816
Who are you?

19
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,991
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

20
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,095
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

21
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,595
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

22
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,893
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which...

23
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:35,696
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

24
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,174
Yes, I...

25
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,504
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

26
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,038
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

27
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,311
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

28
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:56,049
<i>It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."</i>

29
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,626
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

30
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,889
The things we were made
to do there...

31
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,191
Terrible things.

32
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,596
<i>- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.</i>

33
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,300
<i>Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?</i>

34
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,376
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

35
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,275
Yes.

36
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,208
Don't you see?

37
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,213
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

38
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,021
Me.

39
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,923
He's coming for me.

40
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,888
Who? Who's coming?

41
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,392
Totenkopf.

42
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,794
It's Totenkopf.

43
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,620
There!

44
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,292
<i>All citizens, attention.</i>

45
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:17,404
<i>New York City
must be evacuated at once.</i>

46
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,940
<i>Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.</i>

47
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,909
<i>All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty</i>

48
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:28,641
<i>shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.</i>

49
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,250
<i>This is urgent.</i>

50
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,654
<i>- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.</i>

51
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,057
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

52
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,993
<i>Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.</i>

53
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,000
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

54
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:49,501
and someone named Totenkopf.

55
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:52,640
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

56
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,707
Totenkopf. Who is he?

57
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,673
<i>He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.</i>

58
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,540
Quick as you can.

59
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,875
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

60
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,176
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

61
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,683
and get the hell out of there.

62
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,514
Wait a minute.

63
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,626
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

64
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,560
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

65
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,892
Fifth Avenue.

66
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,432
They're a hundred...
They're a hundred yards away.

67
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,797
Polly. Polly!

68
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,534
Oh, my God.

69
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,038
Polly!

70
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,210
Polly!

71
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,211
<i>Polly!</i>

72
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,507
Stop! Come back!

73
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,519
Fire!

74
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:23,722
Get out of here!

75
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,663
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

76
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:27,858
Send everything you've got!

77
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,732
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

78
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,434
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

79
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,877
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

80
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,573
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

81
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,345
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

82
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:48,182
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

83
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,723
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

84
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,989
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

85
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:59,634
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

86
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,376
Polly.

87
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,181
Joe.

88
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,391
<i>Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.</i>

89
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,791
<i>The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication</i>

90
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,594
<i>due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.</i>

91
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,703
<i>Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies</i>

92
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:00,136
<i>now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.</i>

93
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,539
<i>The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg</i>

94
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,111
<i>was virtually excavated</i>

95
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:08,943
<i>by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.</i>

96
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:13,281
<i>News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines</i>

97
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,717
<i>rising from the ground,</i>

98
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:18,757
<i>robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.</i>

99
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:23,059
<i>Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,</i>

100
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,256
<i>world leaders
must once again call upon</i>

101
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:29,369
<i>the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire</i>

102
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,008
<i>to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.</i>

103
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:23,792
Where's Dex?

104
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,302
Shazam.

105
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,256
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

106
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:37,596
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

107
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,901
Oh, I need to show you something.

108
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,362
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

109
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,608
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

110
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,946
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

111
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,877
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

112
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,574
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

113
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,845
I think it's being used
to control them.

114
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,716
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

115
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,523
I can try, yeah.

116
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,022
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

117
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,754
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

118
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,296
Find out what makes it tick.

119
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,268
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

120
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,568
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

121
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:29,448
<i>Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.</i>

122
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:57,437
Tummy ache?

123
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,880
How you been, Joe?

124
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,050
- Miss me?
- Get out.

125
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,616
Well, it's nice to see you too.

126
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,286
Dex said you might be in a mood.

127
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:13,859
Dex?

128
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:15,427
Get in here!

129
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:20,762
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

130
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,800
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

131
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,597
You sabotaged my plane.

132
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:28,604
Right.

133
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,246
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

134
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,180
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

135
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,052
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

136
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,417
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

137
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:44,182
in his bathrobe, remember?

138
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,758
You know, I'm starting to think

139
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,929
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

140
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,257
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

141
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:53,025
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

142
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,430
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

143
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,628
Who was she, Joe?

144
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:00,397
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

145
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,099
What are you gonna do?

146
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,976
Shoot me?

147
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,549
Oh, great. We all made up.

148
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,986
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

149
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,214
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

150
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,256
If she resists, shoot her.

151
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,791
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

152
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:22,088
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

153
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:23,764
Okay.

154
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:28,402
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

155
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:31,973
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

156
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,005
Lots more.

157
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:42,316
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

158
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,815
And you're gonna help me get it.

159
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,852
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

160
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:50,884
Show me what?

161
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,531
Show me what?

162
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,074
My God. What is this?

163
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,010
Where do they come from?

164
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:20,583
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

165
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,451
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

166
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,317
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

167
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,894
and then they disappear
without a trace.

168
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,255
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

169
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,899
or who's sending them here.

170
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,729
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

171
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,134
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

172
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,606
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

173
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,301
Totenkopf.

174
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,378
He nearly went white
when he said it.

175
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,845
Totenkopf, who is he?

176
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,416
He's the invisible man.

177
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,181
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

178
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,655
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

179
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,555
This is the only thing I could dig up.

180
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:05,929
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

181
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,897
before the start of World War I.

182
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:10,264
Something called Unit 11.

183
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,600
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

184
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,874
Until today.

185
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:19,046
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

186
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,511
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

187
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,781
The scientist, where is he now?

188
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,586
We're in this together, right, Joe?

189
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,923
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

190
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,761
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

191
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,300
Understood.

192
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,110
What?

193
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,712
I missed you.

194
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,151
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

195
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,895
Were you down there?

196
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,862
You missed me too. How nice.

197
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:21,404
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

198
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:33,113
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

199
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,887
Dr. Jennings!

200
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,821
It's locked.

201
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:40,658
That window there.

202
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:49,936
I may be able to get in
through that window

203
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:52,129
if I can attach a line...

204
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:57,836
It's open.

205
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,525
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

206
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:01,508
All right, Polly...

207
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,441
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

208
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,274
I was hoping you could tell me.

209
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,885
Dr. Jennings!

210
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,023
You must stop him!

211
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,022
Stay here.

212
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:30,765
Stop!

213
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,369
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,037
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

215
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:14,704
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

216
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,645
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

217
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:22,414
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

218
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:23,613
Promise.

219
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,032
He's dead.

220
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:44,238
I think I found something.

221
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,014
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

222
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:59,516
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

223
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,161
Of course you are.

224
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,441
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

225
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:21,842
and coming straight for us.

226
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,042
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

227
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,085
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

228
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,419
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

229
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,359
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

230
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,465
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

231
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,897
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

232
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:17,435
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

233
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,606
Go, go, go!

234
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:24,344
Get in.

235
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,724
There you are.

236
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:52,638
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

237
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:02,071
Come in, Dex.

238
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:05,552
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

239
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,423
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

240
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,391
<i>- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,</i>

241
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:13,891
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

242
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,255
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

243
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:18,956
Which machine is it, Dex?

244
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,131
<i>There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.</i>

245
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:28,166
I think I found it, Dex.

246
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:39,847
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

247
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:42,545
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

248
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,190
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

249
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,594
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

250
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,091
<i>I'll let you know. Out.</i>

251
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:59,138
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

252
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,774
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

253
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:17,482
They've come back
for the generators.

254
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,651
Who is this guy?

255
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:28,699
- You okay?
- Great.

256
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,497
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

257
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,004
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

258
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,300
Pull up!

259
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,151
- Joe!
- I see it!

260
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:58,265
It's getting away.

261
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,528
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

262
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:10,172
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

263
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:14,678
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

264
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:18,316
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

265
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:25,317
Hey!

266
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,925
Okay, okay, now go straight.

267
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,194
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

268
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,536
Back there.

269
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,482
I could use a little more warning
next time.

270
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:50,651
Go left!

271
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:58,825
Tell me you got something, Dex.

272
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,857
<i>We're getting clobbered up here.</i>

273
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,555
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

274
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,101
Joe!

275
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,746
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

276
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,648
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

277
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,914
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

278
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,622
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

279
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,890
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

280
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,297
Will you just trust me? Go left!

281
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,211
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

282
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:52,379
It's a dead end!

283
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:56,972
There's no way out!

284
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,686
Oh, bugger.

285
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,456
Joe!

286
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:34,077
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

287
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:35,950
I got us here, didn't I?

288
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:43,326
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

289
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:46,295
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

290
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,460
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

291
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,440
Still glad you came?

292
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,824
Joe, I found it! Joe!

293
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,322
<i>Dex, come in. Where is it?</i>

294
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:22,865
<i>Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?</i>

295
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,539
<i>Dex, do you read me?</i>

296
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,413
<i>Dex, are you there?</i>

297
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:15,682
I can't outrun them much longer.

298
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:17,950
Hold on.

299
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:23,428
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

300
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:26,065
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

301
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,134
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

302
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,903
Joe, you have to pull up!

303
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:43,078
Pull up!

304
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,928
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

305
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,900
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

306
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,040
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

307
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,913
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

308
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,851
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

309
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,424
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

310
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:30,461
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

311
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,130
Oh, I can take it.

312
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:37,232
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

313
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:38,666
Because that was nothing.

314
00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:58,792
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

315
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,993
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

316
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,276
Dex!

317
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:28,883
Dex!

318
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,218
Dex.

319
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,546
They're everywhere.

320
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:00,418
Joe, look out!

321
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:51,894
Dex!

322
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:02,648
Why would Totenkopf do this?

323
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:07,176
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

324
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:16,552
He was looking for something.

325
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:24,495
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

326
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,470
He must have got too close.

327
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:49,992
- He was trying to tell me something...
- Joe.

328
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:04,604
Good boy, Dex.

329
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:56,625
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

330
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,698
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

331
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:03,432
- My God.
- What?

332
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:07,073
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 12 years old.

333
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,741
By 17, he had already received
two doctorates

334
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,210
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

335
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:18,374
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

336
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,645
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

337
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:24,153
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

338
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:26,656
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

339
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,489
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

340
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:33,189
Even less is known
about his companion,

341
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,630
an assassin who controls
his machines."

342
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:37,326
She's the one who took Dex.

343
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:39,973
What else?

344
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:47,243
These are Unit 11 supply logs.

345
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:49,382
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

346
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:53,019
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

347
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,246
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

348
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:00,585
What have you been up to, doctor?

349
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:15,935
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

350
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:19,879
We'll find him.

351
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,315
My old friend Joe.

352
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:03,223
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

353
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,555
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

354
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,388
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

355
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,257
Nice to meet you.

356
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:18,671
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

357
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:20,806
Did you get a little something
for me?

358
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:25,206
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

359
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:30,179
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

360
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,511
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

361
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,422
Come, I'll show you the maps.

362
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,700
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

363
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:52,702
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

364
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,537
I don't trust him.

365
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:57,472
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

366
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,806
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

367
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:05,849
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

368
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:18,930
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

369
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,633
This is where
the transmission originated.

370
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:24,269
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

371
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:28,403
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

372
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:30,239
It is forbidden.

373
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:34,141
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

374
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:36,908
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

375
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:39,881
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

376
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,281
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

377
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:47,084
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

378
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:49,956
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

379
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,598
Why? Why is this place so special?

380
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,566
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

381
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,603
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

382
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:03,004
You may know it as Shangri-la.

383
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:12,810
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

384
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,684
I need to send a message.

385
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:24,791
<i>Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.</i>

386
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:28,900
<i>We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.</i>

387
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:31,866
<i>The story grows stranger
at every turn.</i>

388
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:35,337
<i>Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.</i>

389
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,975
<i>I fear time is running out.</i>

390
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:40,742
<i>With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.</i>

391
00:46:40,948 --> 00:46:44,315
<i>I hope. Polly Perkins.</i>

392
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:14,307
This is where civilization stops.

393
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:16,414
A blank on the map.

394
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,217
We must be careful from here.

395
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,554
Hurry.

396
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,482
What is it?

397
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:54,085
It looks like a mining outpost.

398
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,882
Something bad happened here.

399
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,929
Seems to be abandoned.

400
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,291
Tell your men we're heading down.

401
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,324
I want a closer look.

402
00:48:51,912 --> 00:48:53,243
What is it, Joe?

403
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:54,641
Uranium.

404
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,544
The whole mine's contaminated.

405
00:48:58,085 --> 00:48:59,518
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

406
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:02,055
Where's Polly?

407
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:08,488
Polly!

408
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,754
Miss Perkins?

409
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,396
We'll have to split up.

410
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:27,880
Polly!

411
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:31,948
Let her go.

412
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:36,979
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

413
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,748
What vials?
What are you talking about?

414
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:42,525
I will not ask a second time.

415
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:44,991
Drop the gun.

416
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:55,898
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

417
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:58,407
As you wish.

418
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:01,413
Wait! Wait. Wait.

419
00:50:11,191 --> 00:50:12,522
I'm sorry, Joe.

420
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:15,854
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

421
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:30,041
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

422
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,806
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

423
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:38,314
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

424
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,918
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

425
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,851
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

426
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:45,888
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

427
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,456
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

428
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:55,658
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

429
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:59,438
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

430
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,130
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,771
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

432
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:10,545
Do you hear that?

433
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,221
Dynamite.

434
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:28,761
That noise again.

435
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:39,935
Move!

436
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,722
What are you doing?

437
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,531
Come on!

438
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,798
Oh, great.

439
00:52:04,004 --> 00:52:05,699
We're safe.

440
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:09,007
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

441
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,143
There's something
I need to ask you.

442
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:12,538
Yes, Joe?

443
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:17,507
Did you cut my fuel line?

444
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:22,086
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

445
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:25,349
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

446
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,720
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

447
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:42,734
There you are.

448
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:45,411
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

449
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:47,780
My film.

450
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,244
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

451
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:09,464
Polly.

452
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:13,098
Polly.

453
00:53:40,997 --> 00:53:42,760
My clothes.

454
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,670
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

455
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,738
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

456
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:54,877
- Oh, don't tell me you're...
- Naked.

457
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:59,543
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

458
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:04,677
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

459
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,757
Stop looking at me like that.

460
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:12,455
Like what?

461
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:16,424
Turn around, Joe.

462
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,491
I'm serious. Turn around.

463
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:26,900
Hi, Joe.

464
00:54:48,098 --> 00:54:49,998
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

465
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:54,503
The clothes are burned.

466
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:56,569
Burned? Why?

467
00:54:59,876 --> 00:55:01,901
He says the mine is poisonous.

468
00:55:02,112 --> 00:55:03,170
Our clothes were infected.

469
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:09,977
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

470
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:12,678
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

471
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:16,154
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

472
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,958
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

473
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:26,733
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

474
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,005
It's very important we find this man.

475
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,039
His name is Totenkopf!

476
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:39,081
He says, what do you want
with this man?

477
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:41,147
I've come to kill him.

478
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:43,045
And to find my friend.

479
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:49,854
He says he will help you.

480
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:01,567
What do you think?

481
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:07,801
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

482
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:11,444
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

483
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:13,479
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

484
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:15,913
They're waiting for us.

485
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:20,923
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

486
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,183
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

487
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:26,294
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

488
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,521
Where is Totenkopf now?

489
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:32,668
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

490
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,635
I can't believe this is happening.

491
00:56:41,678 --> 00:56:44,306
I only have two shots left.

492
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:48,380
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

493
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:49,950
Everything I had was in that bag.

494
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:51,711
You should have let me go back
for my film.

495
00:56:51,922 --> 00:56:54,152
You're right, I should have.

496
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,420
So where's he taking us?

497
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:06,091
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

498
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,032
What experiments?

499
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,748
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

500
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:34,297
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

501
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:37,489
To make him pay
for what he has done.

502
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:51,445
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

503
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:56,751
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

504
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:01,686
Rana? Is there such a place?

505
00:58:06,162 --> 00:58:09,598
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

506
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:12,596
Of course. Anything.

507
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:18,772
What do you want?

508
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:25,343
Kill me.

509
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,886
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

510
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:43,055
And there's a moon and a star.

511
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:51,406
<i>And all I ask is a tall ship</i>

512
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:55,667
<i>and a star to steer her by</i>

513
00:58:57,147 --> 00:58:58,614
A star.

514
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:01,909
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

515
00:59:02,118 --> 00:59:04,245
Rana is a star.

516
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:08,648
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

517
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:12,521
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

518
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,130
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

519
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,894
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

520
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,933
latitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

521
00:59:20,136 --> 00:59:24,573
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

522
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:26,264
You mean this could really work?

523
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:29,274
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

524
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:31,470
We do things a little
different nowadays.

525
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:34,673
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

526
00:59:34,884 --> 00:59:36,579
- March 2.
- March 2.

527
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:40,882
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

528
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:43,759
March 2...

529
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:50,259
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

530
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:57,902
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

531
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:03,108
Declination, minus 10.60.

532
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:10,477
There's nothing there.

533
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,882
Are you sure you did it right?

534
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:14,818
I'm sure.

535
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:18,392
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

536
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,722
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

537
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,871
What's that point there?

538
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:34,941
That's where we run out of fuel.

539
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:36,806
Oh, great.

540
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:40,246
So how do we get there?

541
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,688
- Franky.
- Who?

542
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,191
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

543
01:00:50,393 --> 01:00:52,691
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

544
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:56,158
If I can get a message to them,

545
01:00:56,366 --> 01:00:59,164
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

546
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:01,769
And what if they don't
get the message?

547
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:05,099
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

548
01:01:07,443 --> 01:01:08,501
They'll be there.

549
01:01:24,727 --> 01:01:26,888
Is that light supposed to be on?

550
01:01:27,096 --> 01:01:28,620
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

551
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:33,262
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

552
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:38,464
Manta Station, do you read me?

553
01:01:39,108 --> 01:01:41,440
Where are you, Franky?

554
01:01:46,749 --> 01:01:47,909
What are you doing?

555
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:51,182
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

556
01:01:51,454 --> 01:01:54,048
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

557
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:58,292
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

558
01:01:58,494 --> 01:02:00,223
Dex had a hand in designing it.

559
01:02:00,597 --> 01:02:03,691
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

560
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,958
Yeah.

561
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,693
I can keep a secret.

562
01:02:14,277 --> 01:02:15,744
Two shots.

563
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:20,314
<i>Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.</i>

564
01:02:20,884 --> 01:02:22,511
Copy, 327.

565
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,949
<i>Welcome aboard, captain.</i>

566
01:03:04,093 --> 01:03:08,359
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

567
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:12,897
It's good to see you too, Franky.

568
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:17,368
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

569
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:18,699
It's important.

570
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:23,873
What is that?

571
01:03:29,485 --> 01:03:31,248
You be nice.

572
01:03:32,488 --> 01:03:35,218
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

573
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:38,923
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

574
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:41,221
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

575
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:45,566
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

576
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:52,271
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

577
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,409
or at least you were last time...

578
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:57,010
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

579
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:59,204
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

580
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:02,873
<i>- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.</i>

581
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:04,451
<i>- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.</i>

582
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:16,628
Take us to 10,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

583
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,800
Yes, commander.

584
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:20,465
Reconnaissance located an island

585
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,434
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

586
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:26,107
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

587
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:28,277
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

588
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:32,670
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

589
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:34,816
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

590
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:39,617
Polly, try not to touch anything.

591
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:43,952
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

592
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,391
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

593
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,899
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

594
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:09,941
Totenkopf.

595
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:15,914
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

596
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:19,288
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

597
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:21,862
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

598
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:25,159
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

599
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:27,393
He's got Dex.

600
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:31,363
Rescind order!

601
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:36,868
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

602
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:44,018
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

603
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,451
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

604
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:49,354
But...

605
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:52,050
...this area here,

606
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:54,024
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

607
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:58,667
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

608
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:01,130
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

609
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:03,703
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

610
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:05,339
Leave that to me.

611
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,540
Alert the amphibious squadron.

612
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:16,450
<i>Report to main station carrier.</i>

613
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,452
What?

614
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:56,852
Nanjing?

615
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,325
I can't hear you, Polly.

616
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:02,060
You'll have to speak up.

617
01:07:23,286 --> 01:07:26,847
<i>Keep your nose up, Joseph. You
always were bad at the short takeoff.</i>

618
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:29,786
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

619
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:35,664
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

620
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:37,258
Thank you, Polly.

621
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:39,398
So you heard that, did you?

622
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:46,770
<i>Manta leader to Manta team,
impact in ten seconds.</i>

623
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:48,671
Switching to amphibious mode.

624
01:07:58,054 --> 01:08:01,023
Impact in five, four, three,

625
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:03,351
two, one.

626
01:08:29,652 --> 01:08:30,744
Franky.

627
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:34,013
<i>You remember our milk run
over Shanghai, don't you?</i>

628
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:36,691
<i>We had the target buttoned up
and he was jinxing in the flak.</i>

629
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:40,191
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

630
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:41,795
<i>- "Protect the rabbits!
-"Protect the rabbits!</i>

631
01:08:41,998 --> 01:08:44,523
<i>- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"</i>

632
01:08:55,177 --> 01:09:00,137
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

633
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:14,796
Joe, watch out!

634
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:59,737
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

635
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:06,476
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

636
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:14,747
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

637
01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:16,786
Manta leader to Manta team,

638
01:10:16,992 --> 01:10:20,257
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

639
01:10:22,898 --> 01:10:23,865
Fire.

640
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,275
Joseph! Pull up!

641
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:55,019
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

642
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:59,366
Do you hear me? Disengage.

643
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:01,597
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

644
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:04,602
<i>- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!</i>

645
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:07,537
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

646
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:11,941
Disengage!

647
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:31,495
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

648
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,065
<i>You're only going to have
one shot at this.</i>

649
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:35,328
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

650
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:37,472
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

651
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,498
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

652
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,573
Franky, pull up.

653
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:45,042
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

654
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:46,737
Two.

655
01:11:46,982 --> 01:11:48,244
One.

656
01:12:02,798 --> 01:12:04,231
You're all clear.

657
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:06,699
<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

658
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:09,698
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

659
01:12:10,906 --> 01:12:12,237
She's some kind of girl.

660
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:14,568
Yes, I know.

661
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:38,099
I'm taking us up.

662
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:33,652
What?

663
01:13:38,928 --> 01:13:43,126
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

664
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,307
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

665
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:04,679
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

666
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:06,878
Suit yourself.

667
01:14:09,425 --> 01:14:12,758
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

668
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:37,148
Run.

669
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:49,928
There.

670
01:15:06,682 --> 01:15:08,081
Polly!

671
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:16,284
Oh, great.

672
01:15:17,926 --> 01:15:19,416
Come on!

673
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:22,564
Polly!

674
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:26,056
Come on!

675
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:36,912
Are you mad?

676
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:37,742
Are you mad?

677
01:15:37,946 --> 01:15:42,110
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

678
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:49,489
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

679
01:15:49,692 --> 01:15:51,990
- I didn't mean...
- I shot the ground!

680
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,054
- What?
- When we were running,

681
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:59,166
I shot the ground.

682
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:05,639
It isn't funny.

683
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:12,773
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

684
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:22,522
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

685
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,615
You gave it to me.

686
01:16:27,696 --> 01:16:29,323
You don't even remember, do you?

687
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:33,224
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

688
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,995
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

689
01:16:36,538 --> 01:16:38,335
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

690
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,939
and I want you to tell me the truth.

691
01:16:40,175 --> 01:16:44,009
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

692
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:46,307
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

693
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:49,541
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

694
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:52,311
Look me in the eyes.

695
01:16:53,889 --> 01:16:56,323
I never fooled around on you.

696
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:57,492
Never.

697
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:02,329
I sabotaged your plane.

698
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,857
- Three months.
- I knew it!

699
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:08,901
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy...

700
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:15,270
He's here.

701
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:27,816
You all right?

702
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:45,070
Through there.

703
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:52,781
Through there.

704
01:18:53,342 --> 01:18:54,741
My God, Joe.

705
01:18:56,078 --> 01:18:57,739
It's an ark.

706
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,278
He's building an ark.

707
01:19:10,392 --> 01:19:12,087
What are you doing?

708
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:16,758
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

709
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:20,093
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

710
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,634
inside a giant rocket ship?

711
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:24,865
I might.

712
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,900
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

713
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:40,683
<i>- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.</i>

714
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:43,289
We have to find Totenkopf.

715
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:54,662
You've got a gift.

716
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:21,822
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

717
01:20:26,735 --> 01:20:27,895
<i>Einsteigen. Komm, springt!</i>

718
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:37,002
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

719
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:39,271
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

720
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:42,109
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

721
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:46,250
The machines that were guarding us

722
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:48,423
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

723
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:50,921
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

724
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,962
Dex! Get us out of here!

725
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:20,652
Good boy, Dex.

726
01:21:21,556 --> 01:21:22,818
Thanks, Cap.

727
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:29,159
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.

728
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:30,456
Or what's left of them.

729
01:21:30,665 --> 01:21:33,691
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

730
01:21:33,902 --> 01:21:35,164
Finish what?

731
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:36,504
Tell them.

732
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:39,765
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

733
01:21:39,975 --> 01:21:41,602
so he proposed the unthinkable:

734
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:45,246
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

735
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:46,414
into space.

736
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:48,606
He used his machines
to collect specimens

737
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:50,478
representing all life on Earth.

738
01:21:50,685 --> 01:21:52,277
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

739
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:55,285
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

740
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:57,788
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

741
01:21:57,993 --> 01:22:00,257
Seeds of a technological utopia.

742
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:01,861
We smuggled them off this island,

743
01:22:02,064 --> 01:22:03,861
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

744
01:22:04,066 --> 01:22:07,627
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

745
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:10,532
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

746
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,367
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

747
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:15,475
Why? What haven't you told us?

748
01:22:15,677 --> 01:22:18,874
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

749
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:21,845
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

750
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,814
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

751
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,113
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

752
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:29,882
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

753
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:31,352
Good boy, Dex.

754
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,658
Careful. Careful.

755
01:22:40,302 --> 01:22:42,736
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

756
01:22:48,443 --> 01:22:49,808
Through there.
That's the only way in.

757
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:53,310
You see, there is no way past them.

758
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:55,750
Five minutes, Joe.

759
01:22:56,952 --> 01:22:58,783
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

760
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,413
He knows what he's doing.

761
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,151
I think.

762
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:11,032
Hey, that's my gun!

763
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:17,799
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

764
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:29,214
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

765
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:30,714
Doctor, stop!

766
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:50,628
<i>Who dares come before me?</i>

767
01:23:50,839 --> 01:23:53,103
<i>Who dares enter this place?</i>

768
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,539
<i>What has begun
cannot be stopped.</i>

769
01:23:56,745 --> 01:24:00,078
<i>- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.</i>

770
01:24:00,282 --> 01:24:01,544
Hello, doctor.

771
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,217
Why are you doing this?

772
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:06,387
<i>I have been witness to a world
consumed by hatred</i>

773
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:08,886
<i>and bent on self-destruction.</i>

774
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:12,389
<i>Watched as we have taken
what was to be a paradise</i>

775
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:15,893
<i>and failed in our responsibilities
as its steward.</i>

776
01:24:16,097 --> 01:24:19,328
<i>I know now that the course
the human race has set for itself</i>

777
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:21,568
<i>cannot be changed.</i>

778
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:26,002
<i>I am the last, desperate chance
for a doomed planet.</i>

779
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:28,904
<i>Now, leave this place or die!</i>

780
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,982
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

781
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:50,997
I meant throw something.

782
01:25:13,188 --> 01:25:14,450
He's not here.

783
01:25:14,923 --> 01:25:16,390
We're too late.

784
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:18,286
These are his personal papers.

785
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:21,985
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

786
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:24,859
- We must find him.
- I found him.

787
01:25:39,914 --> 01:25:41,074
It's impossible.

788
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:43,579
It can't be.

789
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:47,152
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 11, 1918.

790
01:25:47,389 --> 01:25:49,016
He died over 20 years ago.

791
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:57,694
We've been chasing a ghost.

792
01:26:10,412 --> 01:26:12,846
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

793
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,388
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

794
01:26:21,589 --> 01:26:26,959
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

795
01:26:27,162 --> 01:26:30,131
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

796
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:33,324
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

797
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:37,132
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

798
01:26:37,339 --> 01:26:39,705
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

799
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:42,240
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

800
01:26:45,213 --> 01:26:47,773
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

801
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:50,280
it should create a short...

802
01:26:51,953 --> 01:26:55,081
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

803
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:57,053
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

804
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:01,960
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

805
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:04,495
You won't have time to escape.

806
01:27:07,902 --> 01:27:10,063
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

807
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:13,035
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

808
01:27:13,241 --> 01:27:15,766
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

809
01:27:15,977 --> 01:27:17,968
We had a deal.

810
01:27:18,646 --> 01:27:21,672
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

811
01:27:24,652 --> 01:27:28,383
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

812
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,753
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

813
01:27:40,702 --> 01:27:43,170
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

814
01:27:50,745 --> 01:27:53,145
<i>One minute to liftoff.</i>

815
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:09,622
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

816
01:28:12,934 --> 01:28:13,958
How do you wanna do this?

817
01:29:21,803 --> 01:29:24,033
Nice shot, Polly.

818
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:36,576
What took you so long?

819
01:29:40,955 --> 01:29:42,115
She's a machine.

820
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:51,958
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff.</i>

821
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:53,764
<i>Nine...</i>

822
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:55,265
<i>...eight...</i>

823
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,994
<i>...seven...</i>

824
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:58,467
<i>...six...</i>

825
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:00,004
<i>...five...</i>

826
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:01,766
<i>...four...</i>

827
01:30:51,059 --> 01:30:52,822
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

828
01:30:53,027 --> 01:30:55,222
<i>Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

829
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:56,692
There's no time.

830
01:31:01,135 --> 01:31:02,659
That's our only way across.

831
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:09,943
<i>Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

832
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,681
<i>Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!</i>

833
01:31:23,157 --> 01:31:24,852
What did you do now?

834
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:30,097
Come on!

835
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:32,926
<i>Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

836
01:31:45,847 --> 01:31:47,747
<i>Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

837
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:52,577
Hold on!

838
01:31:59,327 --> 01:32:03,058
Please! Don't touch anything else!

839
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,730
There's no time. We'll never make it.

840
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:17,640
<i>Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

841
01:32:25,386 --> 01:32:26,410
Run!

842
01:32:27,889 --> 01:32:30,289
<i>Forty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

843
01:32:38,032 --> 01:32:40,330
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

844
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:45,737
<i>Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

845
01:32:49,877 --> 01:32:52,072
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

846
01:33:01,355 --> 01:33:02,322
It didn't work.

847
01:33:05,893 --> 01:33:07,861
<i>Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

848
01:33:08,463 --> 01:33:11,728
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

849
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:17,203
<i>And God saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth...</i>

850
01:33:17,405 --> 01:33:20,340
<i>- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...</i>

851
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:21,838
Shut up!

852
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:24,637
<i>Ten kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

853
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:26,113
<i>Nine...</i>

<i>...seven...</i>

856
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:32,844
<i>- ...six...
- Why won't you die?</i>

857
01:33:33,054 --> 01:33:35,181
<i>Five kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

858
01:33:36,657 --> 01:33:38,352
<i>Four...</i>

<i>...one.</i>

01:33:49,537 --> 01:33:51,835
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,867
<i>Booster malfunction.</i>

01:33:54,075 --> 01:33:56,134
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

865
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:57,504
<i>Danger.</i>

866
01:33:57,712 --> 01:34:00,237
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

867
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,676
<i>- Booster malfunction.
- Look!</i>

868
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:03,348
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

869
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:06,315
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.

870
01:34:24,071 --> 01:34:26,005
I see them, commander.

871
01:34:26,507 --> 01:34:30,466
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.

872
01:35:22,563 --> 01:35:24,394
One shot.

873
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:29,230
You got your story.

874
01:35:46,988 --> 01:35:48,512
Polly.

875
01:35:50,024 --> 01:35:50,991
- You...
- It's all right.

876
01:35:51,192 --> 01:35:53,456
You don't have to say anything.

877
01:35:56,197 --> 01:35:57,960
Lens cap.
