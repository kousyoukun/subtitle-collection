年青人

5
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,000
你能帮我送个信吗？

6
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,400
好的，瓦格斯博士

7
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,600
交给沃特・詹宁斯博士

8
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,839
我立刻去，博士，不会有问题的

9
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:20,757
“詹宁斯博士，我被跟踪了，你必须保护他们
再见了，朋友――瓦格斯”

10
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,988
（“乔治・瓦格斯博士”名字被划掉）

11
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,616
记事报

“警方搜寻失踪的科学家，乔治・瓦格斯教授”
――波莉・帕金斯

00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,644
波莉・帕金斯办公室

15
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:24,350
“科学家失踪”

16
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,523
帕金斯小姐，这有你的包裹
There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.

17
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,532
上面没有署名
They didn't leave a name.

18
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,638
- 他们说这个很重要
- 谢谢
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

19
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:44,753
伊萨克・牛顿，
现代哲学中的数学原理

20
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,787
“我知道谁是下一个
今晚6点单独来见我！”

21
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,125
我不想让你卷进这件事情里去
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

22
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:21,026
我没事的，佩利先生
你知道我很小心的
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

23
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:24,260
我苦口婆心，你就是听不进去
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

24
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:31,105
- 我看电影要迟到了
- 我不喜欢你对着我笑
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

25
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:32,932
你不喜欢我笑吗？
You don't like my smile?

26
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:35,505
我是不喜欢你笑里藏刀
I don't like what's behind it.

27
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:40,567
听着，波莉，六个科学家失踪了
很可能已经死了
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

28
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:44,643
调查那件事情的人都很危险
我不想你也卷进去
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

29
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,013
仅仅只是去看一部电影，佩利先生
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

30
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:49,946
我给你带些爆米花
I'll bring you some popcorn.

31
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:06,836
图图，我感觉我们好像不在堪萨斯
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

32
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,674
我们肯定在彩虹上
We must be over the rainbow.

33
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,774
这是你寄给我的？
You sent me this?

34
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,513
你是谁？
Who are you?

35
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,686
- 这一切究竟是怎么回事
- 博士
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

36
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,788
沃特・詹宁斯博士，我是一个化学家
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

37
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,286
我是研究核酸辐射的
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

38
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,583
就是蛋白质分子间的键...
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which--

39
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,385
那些失踪的科学家
你说你知道谁是下一个
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

40
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:38,861
是的，我
Yes, l--

41
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:41,189
我们见面的时间到了，博士
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

42
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,720
我是被选中的参加这个秘密试验的
七个科学家中的一个
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

43
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:50,991
在一战之前驻扎在柏林城外
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

44
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:55,726
它被称作Einheit Elf“11单元”
It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 1 1."

45
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:59,301
我们发过誓，
永远不在实验室之外的地方谈论它
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

46
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:02,562
在那里，我们所做的都是些
The things we were made
to do there...

47
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:04,863
可怕的事情
Terrible things.

48
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,265
- 我不该来的
- 现在我确信我们不在堪萨斯了
- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.

49
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,966
你是一个好女巫还是一个坏女巫？
Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?

50
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,041
博士，你说你知道谁是下一个
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

51
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,939
是的
Yes.

52
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:20,871
你没发现吗？
Don't you see?

53
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,873
- 只剩下最后一个了
- 谁？他是谁，博士
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

54
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:26,680
我
Me.

55
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:29,581
他来抓我了
He's coming for me.

56
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,543
谁？谁来了？
Who? Who's coming?

57
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,045
托滕可夫
Totenkopf.

58
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,446
托滕可夫
It's Totenkopf.

59
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,256
瞧那
There!

60
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,924
所有市民，请注意
All citizens, attention.

61
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,035
纽约市必须马上疏散
New York City
must be evacuated at once.

62
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:20,569
请大家有秩序撤到河东路
Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.

63
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:24,535
所有休息的警察和消防队员
All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty

64
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,265
必须马上向上级报道
shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.

65
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:29,873
这很紧急
This is urgent.

66
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,272
- 佩利编辑
- 佩利先生，是我，波莉
- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.

67
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,674
发生什么事了？他们要求撤离市中心
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

68
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,609
听着，佩利先生
我没有时间了
Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.

69
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:47,613
我要你搜集
所有关于沃特・詹宁斯博士的资料
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

70
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:49,113
以及一个叫托滕可夫的人
and someone named Totenkopf.

71
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,251
地址，电话号码，所有你可以找到的
这很重要
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

72
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:54,316
托滕可夫是谁？
Totenkopf. Who is he?

73
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,281
他可能与失踪的科学家有关
He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.

74
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,147
尽快
Quick as you can.

75
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,481
波莉 ，听我说
我要你离开这里
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

76
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:02,781
我想你挂上电话，关上你的记事本
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

77
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,287
离开那个鬼地方
and get the hell out of there.

78
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:06,117
等等
Wait a minute.

79
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:11,226
我看见帕利赛饭店上空有一些东西
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

80
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,158
他们正在穿越第六大街
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

81
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,489
第五大街
Fifth Avenue.

82
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:20,027
他们在一百码
他们在一百码之外
They're a hundred--
They're a hundred yards away.

83
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,390
波莉，波莉！
Polly. Polly!

84
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,126
天啊
Oh, my God.

85
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,629
波莉！
Polly!

86
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,800
波莉！
Polly!

87
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,800
波莉！
Polly!

88
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,093
别跑！回来！
Stop! Come back!

89
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,084
开火！
Fire!

90
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,281
离开这儿！
Get out of here!

91
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:26,220
他们已经突破了防线
要求支援
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

92
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,414
把你所有的部队都派来
Send everything you've got!

93
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:32,286

波莉
Polly.

103
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,597

104
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,800
袭击的进一步情况接踵而至
Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.

105
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,198
城市中心的无线通讯已经中断
The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication

106
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,999
因为能源线被损坏以及电力系统故障
due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.

107
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:56,106
来自英国、法国、德国的电报
Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies

108
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:59,537

now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.

109
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,939
BBC正在报告一家在纽伦堡的钢铁厂
The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg

110
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,510
事实上已被挖空
was virtually excavated

111
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,339
目击者把它形容成一种机械龙卷风
by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.

112
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:12,675
巴黎和马德里通讯社
谈及奇怪的挖掘机器
News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines

113
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,110
正浮出地面
rising from the ground,

114
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:18,148
开采整个地区的煤炭和石油
robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.

115
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,447
同时，全球的军队都高度警戒
Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,

116
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,643
各国元首再一次呼吁
world leaders
must once again call upon

117
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:28,754
天空上尉和他的精英们
the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire

118
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:33,390
来解开这些神秘事件的真相
to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.

119
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,146
德克斯在哪？
Where's Dex?

120
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,628
天啊
Shazam.

121
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,636
我以为你说的这个东西很大
可以把它给我吗？
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

122
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:36,982
如果你查出它从哪儿来
我就买一个做你的圣诞礼物
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

123
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,291
哦，我要给你看些东西
Oh, I need to show you something.

124
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,759
在这种机器第一次出现之前
我记录下这个信号
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

125
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,010
直到我重放它才想到些事情
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

126
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,356
- 摩尔斯代码
- 我开始也是这么想的
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

127
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,289
但是要比这更复杂
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

128
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,991
在低频部份隐藏了载波
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

129
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,265
我想这是用来控制它们的
I think it's being used
to control them.

130
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,139
如果可以再出现，你可以跟踪它吗？
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

131
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:02,949
我可以试试
I can try, yeah.

132
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:04,450
- 很好，德克斯
- 谢谢
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

133
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:08,188
那么看看你能用这个干些什么
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

134
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,734
找出是什么让它运作的
Find out what makes it tick.

135
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,711
- 你不介意吧？
- 当然
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

136
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:19,019
我想知道它从哪儿来
德克斯，是谁送过来的
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

137
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:28,913
转换到坐标图西南69东49
Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.

138
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:56,944
胃痛？
Tummy ache?

139
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,397
你好吗,约瑟夫？
How you been, Joe?

140
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,571
- 想我吗？
- 出去
- Miss me?
- Get out.

141
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:09,143
很好，很高兴再次见到你
Well, it's nice to see you too.

142
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:11,816
德克斯说你可能心情不好
Dex said you might be in a mood.

143
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,392
德克斯？
Dex?

144
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,962
进来
Get in here!

145
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:20,306
已经三年了，约瑟夫
你现在生我气了，对吧？
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

146
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,346
还记得我们当初为什么吵架吗？
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

147
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:24,146
你弄坏了我的飞机
You sabotaged my plane.

148
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,160
是的
Right.

149
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:31,807
因为你 我在满洲的监狱呆了6个月
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

150
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:34,745
- 他们想切断我的手指。
- 约瑟夫
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

151
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:38,623
上一次，我没有弄坏你那该死的飞机
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

152
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:41,994
你那样只是为了得到东条英机的照片
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

153
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,761
在他的的浴衣里，记得吗？
in his bathrobe, remember?

154
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:45,340
是的，我开始认为
You know, I'm starting to think

155
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,513
你编造了这个弄坏飞机的谣言
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

156
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,845
来瞒着我
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

157
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,617
和你的神秘女孩卿卿我我
那个时候我们都在南京
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

158
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:55,027
没有的事
都是你自己瞎想的
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

159
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,227
她是谁，约瑟夫？
Who was she, Joe?

160
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,000
- 她叫什么？
- 够了
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

161
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:01,705
你想干吗？
What are you gonna do?

162
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,586
杀了我吗？
Shoot me?

163
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:09,167
太好了，我们都到齐了
Oh, great. We all made up.

164
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,607
见到你很荣幸，波莉
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

165
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,842
让我们像10年前那样
护送帕金斯小姐离开基地，德克斯
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

166
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,887
如果她反抗，就开枪
If she resists, shoot her.

167
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,424
- 嘿，波莉
- 嘿，德克斯
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

168
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,725
- 我准备...
- 没事，我知道
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

169
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,403
好的
Okay.

170
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:28,049
还有，我猜你对这个可能没兴趣吧
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

171
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:31,625
- 你从那儿得到那个？
- 那儿还有更多这样的东西
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

172
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,660
很多
Lots more.

173
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:41,984
- 我要那个图纸，波莉
- 我要这个新闻，约瑟夫
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

174
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:44,486
你要帮助我得到它
And you're gonna help me get it.

175
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:47,528
可能我们应该给她看看，上尉
或许她能提供帮助
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

176
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:50,564
给我看什么
Show me what?

177
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,223
给我看什么
Show me what?

178
00:22:10,123 --> 00:22:12,788
天啊，这是什么？
My God. What is this?

179
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,729
你们从哪弄来的？
Where do they come from?

180
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,309
三年前它们在一个偏远地区出现
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

181
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:23,181
我们保守这个秘密至今
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

182
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,052
它们来之前没有任何征兆
拿走它们想要的东西
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

183
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,633
接着它们消失的无影无踪
and then they disappear
without a trace.

184
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:30,997
三年了，我仍然不知道它们想要什么
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

185
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,643
或谁派它们来的
or who's sending them here.

186
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:35,478
今天有一个人和我会面
一个科学家
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

187
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:38,888
他很害怕
说有人要抓他
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

188
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:42,365
我问他在害怕谁
他一直重复一个名字：
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

189
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,063
托滕可夫
Totenkopf.

190
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,143
他说的时候脸色苍白
He nearly went white
when he said it.

191
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:48,614
托滕可夫，他是谁？
Totenkopf, who is he?

192
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,189
他是个神秘的人
He's the invisible man.

193
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:54,959
我已经查看了所有馆藏记录两次
希望能查出点什么
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

194
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,439
我已经联系了从巴黎到曼谷
所有我所能联系的人
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

195
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,342
这是我唯一知道的
This is the only thing I could dig up.

196
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:05,723
他掌管着柏林郊外的一些秘密科学基地
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

197
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,695
在第一次世界大战之前
before the start of World War l.

198
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,066
一些叫做11单元的东西
Something called Unit 1 1.

199
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:13,406
上次别人提到他的名字
已经是三十多年前了
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

200
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,684
直到今天才又有人提起
Until today.

201
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:18,861
看看他用的徽章
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

202
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:22,331
标记在所有这些机器上
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

203
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:27,609
那个科学家，他现在在哪？
The scientist, where is he now?

204
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,420
我们一起干吧，约瑟夫？
We're in this together, right, Joe?

205
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,767
直到我同意前任何事都不可以公开
你不能写一句话
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

206
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:40,609
或者在没有得到我的同意下照相，懂了吗？
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

207
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:43,152
知道了
Understood.

208
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:58,986
什么？
What?

209
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:01,592
我想你
I missed you.

210
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:07,039
另外，谢谢你今天救了我
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

211
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:10,789
是你跌倒在那吗？
Were you down there?

212
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:14,761
你也想我
真好
You missed me too. How nice.

213
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:21,314
就是这了
这就是詹宁斯的实验室
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

214
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:33,041
詹宁斯博士？我是波莉・帕金斯
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

215
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:36,820
詹宁斯博士
Dr. Jennings!

216
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,757
它锁上了
It's locked.

217
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:40,597
那里有个窗户
That window there.

218
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,889
我可能可以从那个窗户进去
I may be able to get in
through that window

219
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:52,086
如果我有一条绳子...
if I can attach a line...

220
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:57,801
开了
It's open.

221
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,515
我们来晚了
有人已经来过了
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

222
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:01,571
好了，波莉
All right, Polly...

223
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,508
别在玩花样了
到底发生了什么？
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

224
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:07,345
我还希望你告诉我呢
I was hoping you could tell me.

225
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,966
詹宁斯博士
Dr. Jennings!

226
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,109
你必须阻止他！
You must stop him!

227
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,121
呆在这儿
Stay here.

228
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:30,890
别动！
Stop!

229
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,506
我不想伤害你
I don't wanna hurt you.

230
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,269
- 帕金斯小姐
- 我在这，博士
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

231
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:14,946
- 我去找人来帮你
- 答应我
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

232
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:18,897
如果托滕可夫找到它们，倒计时就会开始
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

233
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:22,676
- 这个世界就会毁灭
- 我不明白，博士，找什么？
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

234
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:23,878
答应我
Promise.

235
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,344
他死了
He's dead.

236
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,558
我想我找到了些东西
I think I found something.

237
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,352
今天早上在电影院里詹宁斯博士就带着这个
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

238
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:59,877
- 我最好回到基地去
- 我和你一起去
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

239
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,526
当然
Of course you are.

240
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,502
雷达侦察到有物体以500哩/小时的速度移动
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

241
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:21,903
直接向我们这儿过来了
and coming straight for us.

242
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:25,103
- 它们到我们这儿还有多久？
- 看那
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

243
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:34,146
准备好我的飞机，我要起飞了
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

244
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:07,480
- 你在干什么？
- 我和你一起去
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

245
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,420
别傻了，记得上次你和我一起飞的时候
发生了什么吗
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

246
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,526
- 我们有一个协议
- 这不是游戏，波莉
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

247
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,958
- 人们就要死了
- 你别想扔下我，约瑟夫
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

248
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:17,496
这次不行，这是我的新闻
并且我们有协议！
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

249
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,667
快跑，快跑，快跑
Go, go, go!

250
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:24,405
上来
Get in.

251
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:46,785
就是你
There you are.

252
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:52,699
- 上尉，这里是德克斯，你能听到吗？
- 别挂断，德克斯，我有些事要先处理
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

253
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:02,132
说吧，德克斯
Come in, Dex.

254
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,613
听着，不管你作什么，不要开枪！
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

255
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:10,484
- 好的
- 你开枪了，是不是？
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

256
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:12,452
- 是的
- 听着，上尉
- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,

257
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:13,952
信号来自其中一台飞机
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

258
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:15,316
你必须让它们保持完整
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

259
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:19,017
是哪台机器，德克斯？
Which machine is it, Dex?

260
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:23,192
这没法说
可能是其中任何一台
There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.

261
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:28,227
我想我找到它了，德克斯
I think I found it, Dex.

262
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:39,908
- 等等，上尉，我失去信号了
- 它正前往城市
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

263
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:42,606
别让它跑了，你把信号反馈给我
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

264
00:30:42,818 --> 00:30:44,251
如果现在让它跑了，
我们可能再也追不到了
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

265
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:46,655
告诉我什么时候你发现的，德克斯
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

266
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,152
我会让你知道的
完毕
I'll let you know. Out.

267
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,199
好了，我要一个全光谱扫描仪
扫描所有进来的信号
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

268
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,835
放大每一个不同的频率周期
并把它们发送给我
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

269
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:17,543
它们回到发电机那里了
They've come back
for the generators.

270
00:31:18,654 --> 00:31:19,712
这些家伙是谁？
Who is this guy?

271
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:28,760
- 你还好吧？
- 没事
- You okay?
- Great.

272
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:31,558
如果你需要
这里有一瓶镁氧奶在座位下
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

273
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,065
- 我没事
- 你看起来不是很好
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

274
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,361
小心
Pull up!

275
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:51,212
- 约瑟夫！
- 我看见它了！
- Joe!
- I see it!

276
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,326
它要跑了
It's getting away.

277
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:04,589
- 我失去了信号，上尉
- 我会找到它的，德克斯，别急
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

278
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:10,233
- 去左边
- 往后坐，波莉
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

279
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:14,739
这里有一条捷径去百老汇
你可以在第42号街跟住它
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

280
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:18,377
这些街道我如数家珍
去左边！
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

281
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:25,378
嗨
Hey!

282
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:33,986
好的，好的，现在直走
Okay, okay, now go straight.

283
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:36,255
- 不，不，不，走右边！
- 什么时候？
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

284
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,597
回那里
Back there.

285
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:49,543
下次我需要你早一点的提示
I could use a little more warning
next time.

286
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:50,712
走左边！
Go left!

287
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:58,886
告诉我你发现了什么，德克斯
Tell me you got something, Dex.

288
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,918
我们这儿很不爽
We're getting clobbered up here.

289
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:05,616
我这里也不舒服，上尉
坚持住，我很快就能找到了
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

290
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,162
约瑟夫！
Joe!

291
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:25,807
德克斯！我们不能坚持多久了！
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

292
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:27,709
- 我就快找到了
- 我们必须撤退了！
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

293
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,975
你们先走
我随后而来
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

294
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,683
- 漂亮
- 好的，在药店转左
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

295
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,951
- 再左
- 我们在绕圈
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

296
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,358
你相信我行吗？转左！
Will you just trust me? Go left!

297
00:33:49,304 --> 00:33:51,272
- 这是一个死胡同
- 应该可以走出去的啊
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

298
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:52,440
这是死胡同！
It's a dead end!

299
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:57,033
这里没有路可以出去！
There's no way out!

300
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,747
哦，畜生们
Oh, bugger.

301
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:10,517
约瑟夫！
Joe!

302
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:34,138
- 领头的在那里
- 捷径
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

303
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,011
是我带的路，不是吗？
I got us here, didn't l?

304
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:43,387
- 德克斯，德克斯！
- 还要30秒，上尉，我需要30秒
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

305
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:46,356
- 30秒
- 或多或少
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

306
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:50,521
听着，我会试着把它们带到水面上
多耗点时间，完毕
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

307
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:55,501
你还想和我一起来吗？
Still glad you came?

308
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,885
约瑟夫，我找到它了！约瑟夫！
Joe, I found it! Joe!

309
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,383
德克斯,告诉我
它在哪里？
Dex, come in. Where is it?

310
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,926
告诉我，德克斯
你在那儿吗？德克斯？
Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?

311
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,600
德克斯，你听到没有？
Dex, do you read me?

312
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,474
德克斯，你还在吗？
Dex, are you there?

313
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:15,743
我没时间和它们绕了
I can't outrun them much longer.

314
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,011
坚持住
Hold on.

315
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:23,489
约瑟夫，你在干什么？
你在往下直坠
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

316
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:26,126
- 你会杀了我们的！
- 我知道我在作什么，坚持住
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

317
00:36:26,328 --> 00:36:29,195
我们速度太快了
我们不可能成功的
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

318
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,964
约瑟夫，你必须上升
Joe, you have to pull up!

319
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:43,139
上升！
Pull up!

320
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:02,989
- 我们在水下走
- 德克斯做了这个装置
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

321
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:04,961
从他的一本连环画里上得来的想法
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

322
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:17,101
你是说，你一直都知道
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

323
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:19,974
而且你让我以为我们将坠机？
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

324
00:37:20,182 --> 00:37:22,912
我以为我们要死了！
你应该告诉我的！
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

325
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:27,485
瞧，波莉，是你要来的
不是我让你来的
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

326
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:30,522
如果你受不了，
那就不是我的问题了
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

327
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:33,191
我受的了
Oh, I can take it.

328
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:37,293
- 我能忍受你的一切
- 好的
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

329
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:38,727
因为那不算什么
Because that was nothing.

330
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,853
德克斯，你在吗
能听见我吗？
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

331
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:03,054
你能听见我吗，德克斯？重复
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

332
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:25,337
德克斯！
Dex!

333
00:38:27,716 --> 00:38:28,944
德克斯！
Dex!

334
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,279
德克斯
Dex.

335
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,607
它们到处都是
They're everywhere.

336
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:00,479
约瑟夫，小心！
Joe, look out!

337
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:51,955
德克斯！
Dex!

338
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,709
托滕可夫为什么要这样做？
Why would Totenkopf do this?

339
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:07,237
为什么抓走德克斯？
这没有任何意义
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

340
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,613
他在找什么
He was looking for something.

341
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:24,556
德克斯说他找到信号从哪儿发射过来的了
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

342
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,531
他一定很接近了
He must have got too close.

343
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,053
- 他想告诉我什么
- 约瑟夫
- He was trying to tell me something--
- Joe.

344
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:04,665
干得好，德克斯
Good boy, Dex.

345
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,686
这些日记属于瓦格斯博士的
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

346
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:00,759
在他消失之前
他一定已经交给了詹宁斯博士
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

347
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,493
- 我的天
- 什么？
- My God.
- What?

348
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:07,134
在托滕可夫12岁的时候
他获得了第一个专利
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 1 2 years old.

349
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:10,802
17岁时，他已经拿到了两个博士学位
By 1 7, he had already received
two doctorates

350
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:14,271
是他们那个时代最受关注的人
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

351
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:18,435
他消失后一年
可怕的谣言开始流传开来
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

352
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,706
说托滕可夫已经开始制造
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

353
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:24,214
一个毁灭世界的黑暗设施
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

354
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,717
寻找他的任务一个个的失败了
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

355
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:30,550
直到今天他的行踪仍是一个谜
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

356
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,250
对他的同伴也了解甚少
Even less is known
about his companion,

357
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:35,691
一个控制机器的杀手
an assassin who controls
his machines."

358
00:42:35,897 --> 00:42:37,387
她就是抓德克斯的人
She's the one who took Dex.

359
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:40,034
还有什么？
What else?

360
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:47,304
这是11单元供给记录
These are Unit 1 1 supply logs.

361
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:49,443
这些都是他用他的机器收集的
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

362
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:53,080
在最后的三年里，包括城市的发电机
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

363
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:56,307
它读起来就像全世界的购物清单
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

364
00:42:58,086 --> 00:43:00,646
你究竟在做什么呢，博士？
What have you been up to, doctor?

365
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:15,996
没事的，约瑟夫
德克斯能照顾好他自己的
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

366
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,940
我们会找到他的
We'll find him.

367
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:02,376
我的老朋友约瑟夫
My old friend Joe.

368
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:03,284
- 很高兴再看到你
- 我也一样，卡吉
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

369
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:05,616
很高兴再看到你
我也一样，卡吉
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

370
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,449
这是 波莉・帕金斯
她将和我们一起去
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

371
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,318
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

372
00:44:14,796 --> 00:44:18,732
- 卡吉，你拿到我需要的地图了吗？
- 是的，它们在里面
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

373
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:20,867
你有没有我要的那些东西
Did you get a little something
for me?

374
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:25,267
当然，三箱
如你所需
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

375
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:30,240
维也纳香肠
我的天，期盼的太久了
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

376
00:44:30,445 --> 00:44:32,572
卡吉，你的西藏语如何？
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

377
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
冷的时候乳头都能冻硬

378
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:42,483
过来，我给你看地图
Come, I'll show you the maps.

379
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:48,761
- 你对他了解多少？
- 卡吉？
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

380
00:44:48,963 --> 00:44:52,763
他是罗马兵团老侦察兵，怎么了？
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

381
00:44:53,301 --> 00:44:54,598
我不相信他
I don't trust him.

382
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:57,533
这很有趣，他也不相信你
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

383
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,867
拿着，换衣服
你的衣服留下来
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

384
00:45:03,077 --> 00:45:05,910
我们去的地方不能穿高跟鞋
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

385
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:18,991
德克斯追踪信号到了这里
卡勒根的北方流域
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

386
00:45:19,294 --> 00:45:21,694
这就是信号发出的地方
This is where
the transmission originated.

387
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,330
为什么这里没有标记呢？
这里是什么地方？
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

388
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:28,464
- 香巴拉
- 你知道吗？
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

389
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:30,300
这是禁地
It is forbidden.

390
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:34,202
据说是据称那里是时间之轮的发源地
一种西藏巫术
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

391
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:36,969
据说生活在那里的人有超自然的力量
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

392
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:39,942
你能带我们去那，卡吉，是吗？
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

393
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:42,342
没人会冒这个险
太危险了
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

394
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:47,145
香巴拉据说受时轮喇嘛庙的主持的保护
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

395
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:50,017
如果他们发现我们在这儿
他们会杀了我们的
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

396
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,659
为什么？为什么这个地方这么特别
Why? Why is this place so special?

397
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:56,627
香巴拉还有很多名字
对希伯来人来说，它是伊甸园
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

398
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:59,664
对于古希腊人来说，它是圣域
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

399
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:03,065
你们可能听过香格里拉
You may know it as Shangri-la.

400
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:12,871
风暴要来了
如果你们仍然想去，我们现在就必须走了
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

401
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:15,745
我需要发一条信息
I need to send a message.

402
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:24,852
佩利编辑，这可能是
你收到我的最后一条信息了
Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.

403
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:28,961
我们追踪无线信号到了尼泊尔
去寻找托滕可夫博士
We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.

404
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:31,927
这个新闻越来越曲折离奇
The story grows stranger
at every turn.

405
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:35,398
关于倒计时的线索到底是什么，我不知道
Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.

406
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:37,036
我担心时间已经不够了
I fear time is running out.

407
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:40,803
如果幸运，我将很快带着德克斯
还有这个新闻一起回来
With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.

408
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:44,376
我希望我能成功
波莉・帕金斯
I hope. Polly Perkins.

409
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:14,368
这里是与世隔绝的地方
This is where civilization stops.

410
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:16,475
地图在这里是一片空白
A blank on the map.

411
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:20,278
从这里开始，我们必须小心
We must be careful from here.

412
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:24,615
快点
Hurry.

413
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,399
这是什么？
What is it?

414
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,002
这看起来象一个矿区
It looks like a mining outpost.

415
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,799
这里发生过不幸的事
Something bad happened here.

416
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,846
看起来已经被遗弃了
Seems to be abandoned.

417
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,208
告诉你的人我们往下走
Tell your men we're heading down.

418
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,241
我得走近去看看
I want a closer look.

419
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,160
那是什么，约瑟夫？
What is it, Joe?

420
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:54,558
铀
Uranium.

421
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,461
整个矿井都被污染了
The whole mine's contaminated.

422
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,435
- 我们不能呆在这里
- 快点离开
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

423
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:01,972
波莉呢？
Where's Polly?

424
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,405
波莉！
Polly!

425
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,671
帕金斯小姐？
Miss Perkins?

426
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,313
我们需要分开来找
We'll have to split up.

427
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,797
波莉！
Polly!

428
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:31,865
不要管她了
Let her go.

429
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,896
把管子给我，她才能活命
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

430
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,665
什么管子？
你在说些什么啊？
What vials?
What are you talking about?

431
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,442
我不会再要一遍
I will not ask a second time.

432
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,908
把枪丢掉
Drop the gun.

433
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,815
我已经告诉你了，我不知道你在说些什么
等会儿你就得把我们都杀了
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

434
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,324
你说得没错
As you wish.

435
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,330
等等！ 等等，等等
Wait! Wait. Wait.

436
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,439
对不起，约瑟夫
I'm sorry, Joe.

437
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,771
再见了，我的朋友们
你们的旅程就在这里结束了
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

438
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,958
我本来准备告诉你的，约瑟夫
你得相信我
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

439
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,723
- 管子里面装了什么？
- 我不知道
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

440
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:38,231
- 你认为我会相信？
- 我说的是实话，约瑟夫
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

441
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,835
詹宁斯博士在他死前给我的
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

442
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,768
他说如果托滕可夫得到那个瓶子的话
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

443
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,805
世界末日就会来临的
倒计时就会开始
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

444
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,373
从一开始你就没对我说过实话
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

445
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:55,575
是的，我没说实话，但是我没有夸大事实
詹宁斯博士就是那样讲的
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

446
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,355
那就是托滕可夫一直在找的东西
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

447
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,047
- 也是他为什么带走德克斯的原因
- 对不起
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

448
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,688
我从没想过这些事情会发生
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

449
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,462
你听到那声音了吗？
Do you hear that?

450
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:25,138
炸药
Dynamite.

451
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:28,678
又是那种声音
That noise again.

452
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,852
快点！
Move!

453
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,639
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

454
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,448
快跑！
Come on!

455
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,715
哦，太好了
Oh, great.

456
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,616
我们安全了
We're safe.

457
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,924
波莉，这也许是我们呆在一起的最后时光
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

458
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,060
我有些事情要问你
There's something
I need to ask you.

459
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,455
什么事，约瑟夫？
Yes, Joe?

460
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,424
你割了我的油管吗？
Did you cut my fuel line?

461
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:22,003
天啊！我没有动你那恶心的飞机！
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

462
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:25,266
我们在世上的最后时光
你要问我的就是这个？
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

463
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,637
我们能不能在死去时不争论这些东西？
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

464
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,651
你们在这里啊
There you are.

465
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,328
- 你们为什么把门锁上？
- 快跑！
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

466
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,697
我的胶卷
My film.

467
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,161
波莉．不要了！
没时间了！
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

468
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,381
波莉
Polly.

469
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,015
波莉
Polly.

470
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:42,677
我的衣服
My clothes.

471
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:47,587
你在这里干什么？
出去，出去！
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

472
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:50,655
除非你在下面为我藏了一条裤子
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

473
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:54,794
- 哦，不要告诉我你是
- 光着身子
- Oh, don't tell me you're--
- Naked.

474
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:59,460
- 没错，波莉
- 这个不好笑，约瑟夫
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

475
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:04,594
我们在哪里？发生什么事情了？
我们的衣服呢？
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

476
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:09,674
不要那样看着我
Stop looking at me like that.

477
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:12,372
怎样？
Like what?

478
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:16,341
转过身去，约瑟夫
Turn around, Joe.

479
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:19,408
我是认真的，转过身去
I'm serious. Turn around.

480
00:54:25,793 --> 00:54:26,817
嘿，约瑟夫
Hi, Joe.

481
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:49,915
问他把我们的衣服怎么了
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

482
00:54:52,953 --> 00:54:54,420
衣服被烧了
The clothes are burned.

483
00:54:54,621 --> 00:54:56,486
被烧了？为什么？
Burned? Why?

484
00:54:59,793 --> 00:55:01,818
他说矿井是有毒的
He says the mine is poisonous.

485
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:03,087
我们的衣服被污染了
Our clothes were infected.

486
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,894
他说他准备带我们回到山下去
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

487
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,595
我们穿好衣服他就带我们走
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

488
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:16,071
我们对此深表谢意，但是和他说清楚
我们到这里来是为了找一个人的
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

489
00:55:23,317 --> 00:55:24,875
他说我们必须在天黑前离开
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

490
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:26,650
他不能再帮我们做些什么了
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

491
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:29,922
找到这个人是件很重要的事情
It's very important we find this man.

492
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:31,956
他的名字是托滕可夫！
His name is Totenkopf!

493
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,998
他问，你找这个人干嘛？
He says, what do you want
with this man?

494
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:41,064
我来杀他
I've come to kill him.

495
00:55:41,301 --> 00:55:42,962
还有找我的朋友
And to find my friend.

496
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:49,771
他说他会帮你
He says he will help you.

497
00:55:59,653 --> 00:56:01,484
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

498
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:07,718
我想他们不该把衣服烧掉
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

499
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:11,361
你和我说不能带其他的任何东西
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

500
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:13,396
我看你像头长毛象
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

501
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:15,830
他们在等我们
They're waiting for us.

502
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:20,840
主持说托滕可夫压迫他的手下
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

503
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,100
让他们在有毒的矿里干活
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

504
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:26,211
而那些没有马上死的人
被送到这里给他研究
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

505
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:28,438
托滕可夫现在在哪里？
Where is Totenkopf now?

506
00:56:28,649 --> 00:56:32,585
他也不知道，只知道
托滕可夫在多年前走了
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

507
00:56:37,357 --> 00:56:39,552
我不敢相信发生的这一切
I can't believe this is happening.

508
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:44,223
底片只剩下两张了
I only have two shots left.

509
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:48,297
我们现在在香格里拉
但是我只剩下两张底片
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

510
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:49,867
我所有的东西都在那个包里
Everything I had was in that bag.

511
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,628
你该让我回去取胶卷的
You should have let me go back
for my film.

512
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,069
对的,我应该让你去拿
You're right, I should have.

513
00:56:59,847 --> 00:57:01,337
他带我们去哪里？
So where's he taking us?

514
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:06,008
去见托滕可夫试验过后唯一的幸存者
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

515
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,949
什么试验？
What experiments?

516
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:24,665
问他，托滕可夫在哪里？
告诉他找到托滕可夫很重要
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

517
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:34,214
他想知道为什么
你为什么找托滕可夫？
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

518
00:57:34,414 --> 00:57:37,406
让他为他所做过的事情后悔
To make him pay
for what he has done.

519
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:51,362
他的杖子，他在要他的杖子
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

520
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:56,668
他说，跟着罗娜
杖子会引导你们找到托滕可夫
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

521
00:57:58,372 --> 00:58:01,603
罗娜？有这个地方吗？
Rana? Is there such a place?

522
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,515
他说他已经帮过你了
你得帮他了
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

523
00:58:10,784 --> 00:58:12,513
没问题，什么都可以
Of course. Anything.

524
00:58:17,324 --> 00:58:18,689
你想要什么？
What do you want?

525
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:25,260
杀了我
Kill me.

526
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:38,803
你看过这个了吗？
它上面有标记，像是一把尺子
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

527
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:42,972
并且还有月亮和星星
And there's a moon and a star.

528
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,323
他告诉我开着飞机去
And all I ask is a tall ship

529
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:55,584
让星星为你导航
and a star to steer her by

530
00:58:57,064 --> 00:58:58,531
一颗星星
A star.

531
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,826
他讲的不是地名
是一颗星星！
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

532
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:04,162
罗娜是颗星星
Rana is a star.

533
00:59:04,504 --> 00:59:08,565
古时的水手是靠星空来导航的
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

534
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:12,438
他们通过月亮和星星来确定他们的位置
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

535
00:59:12,946 --> 00:59:14,047
北欧海盗就是以通过一些星星
画地图而著称
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

536
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,811
北欧海盗就是以通过一些星星
画地图而著称
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

537
00:59:17,017 --> 00:59:19,850
制作纬度表也需要一颗关键的星
Iatitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

538
00:59:20,053 --> 00:59:24,490
这颗关键的星就是雅格布之星
一定就是这个东西！
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

539
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:26,181
你是说这个确实可以用来导航？
You mean this could really work?

540
00:59:26,393 --> 00:59:29,191
你确认可以用这个来找到托滕可夫？
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

541
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:31,387
现在我们只是做起来
和古人有些不一样而已
We do things a little
different nowadays.

542
00:59:31,598 --> 00:59:34,590
我们需要知道的是从哪里着手
今天几号？
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

543
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:36,496
- 三月二日
- 三月二日
- March 2.
- March 2.

544
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:40,799
把卡拉卡尔高原作为我们的假定位置...
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

545
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:43,676
三月二日...
March 2...

546
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:50,176
罗娜的纬度是20.40
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

547
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:57,819
赤经，3个赤经十五度，再43分
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

548
00:59:58,258 --> 01:00:03,025
赤纬，减去10.60
Declination, minus 10.60.

549
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,394
那里什么也没有
There's nothing there.

550
01:00:10,604 --> 01:00:12,799
你肯定你没搞错？
Are you sure you did it right?

551
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:14,735
当然没错
I'm sure.

552
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:18,309
如果那个老人没搞错
托滕可夫现在就应该在那里
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

553
01:00:18,512 --> 01:00:20,639
真是一个难以捉摸的死疙瘩啊
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

554
01:00:30,957 --> 01:00:32,788
那个点是什么意思？
What's that point there?

555
01:00:32,993 --> 01:00:34,858
我们飞到那里就没油了
That's where we run out of fuel.

556
01:00:35,062 --> 01:00:36,723
哦，还真不赖
Oh, great.

557
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:40,163
那我们怎么飞到目的地？
So how do we get there?

558
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:46,605
- 弗兰基
- 谁？
- Franky.
- Who?

559
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:50,108
弗兰基・库克
我的一位老朋友
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

560
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,608
她掌管着一支皇家海军机动侦察前哨部队
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

561
01:00:53,914 --> 01:00:56,075
如果我能和他们联系上的话
If I can get a message to them,

562
01:00:56,283 --> 01:00:59,081
我也许可以安排在那个坐标会合
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

563
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:01,686
那如果联系不上呢？
And what if they don't
get the message?

564
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:05,016
弗兰基从来没让我失望过
他们会在那里出现的
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

565
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,418
他们肯定会到的
They'll be there.

566
01:01:24,644 --> 01:01:26,805
那盏信号灯这时候亮是不是在你预料之中？
Is that light supposed to be on?

567
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:28,537
放心，波莉，不会有事的
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

568
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:33,179
- 飞机没油了，对吧？
- 系好安全带
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

569
01:01:36,356 --> 01:01:38,381
曼塔基地，能收到我的信息吗？
Manta Station, do you read me?

570
01:01:39,025 --> 01:01:41,357
你在哪里，弗兰基？
Where are you, Franky?

571
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:47,826
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

572
01:01:48,335 --> 01:01:51,099
我们不能在这个不毛之地迫降啊
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

573
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:53,965
没有啊，我正准备降落在上面
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

574
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:58,209
- 这是什么？
- 这是一个机动机场
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

575
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:00,140
德克斯也参与了设计
Dex had a hand in designing it.

576
01:02:00,514 --> 01:02:03,608
这是一个秘密
你会保密的，对吧，波莉？
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

577
01:02:03,817 --> 01:02:04,875
当然
Yeah.

578
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:07,610
我会保守秘密的
I can keep a secret.

579
01:02:14,194 --> 01:02:15,661
两张底片
Two shots.

580
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:20,231
允许在327号甲板上降落
保持目前航线
Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.

581
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:22,428
收到，327
Copy, 327.

582
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:24,866
欢迎降落，上尉
Welcome aboard, captain.

583
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:08,276
约瑟夫・苏利文
我还以为你已经死了
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

584
01:03:11,051 --> 01:03:12,814
很高兴见到你,弗兰基
It's good to see you too, Franky.

585
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:17,285
最好是有重要任务否则有你好受的
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

586
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,616
是有重要任务
It's important.

587
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:23,790
那是谁？
What is that?

588
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,165
要友好点
You be nice.

589
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:35,135
库克指挥官
这是波莉・帕金斯
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

590
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:38,840
波莉・帕金斯
久仰了
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

591
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:41,138
终于遇到了我的情敌真令人高兴
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

592
01:03:42,082 --> 01:03:45,483
南京的事情过去有段时间了吧
对吧，约瑟夫？
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

593
01:03:48,388 --> 01:03:52,188
呃，弗兰基，我听说你的三号引擎有点问题
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

594
01:03:52,392 --> 01:03:54,326
至少上次是这样的
or at least you were last time--

595
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:56,927
指挥官，我们在西北方
发现敌人的六艘潜艇
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

596
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,121
方位是西北30度
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

597
01:03:59,332 --> 01:04:02,790
- 现在谁想要杀你啊？
- 让你的人进入战斗位置
- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.

598
01:04:03,003 --> 01:04:04,368
- 全体船员做好战斗准备
- 跟我来
- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.

599
01:04:14,714 --> 01:04:16,545
升到10000英尺
开始反击
Take us to 1 0,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

600
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,717
遵命，长官
Yes, commander.

601
01:04:18,585 --> 01:04:20,382
侦察分队在我们东北方向
Reconnaissance located an island

602
01:04:20,587 --> 01:04:23,351
3公里处发现了一个小岛
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

603
01:04:23,556 --> 01:04:26,024
但是我们无法在任何地图上找到它
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

604
01:04:26,226 --> 01:04:28,194
- 肯定就是他
- 就是谁？
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

605
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:32,587
这次你又让我惹上什么麻烦了，约瑟夫？
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

606
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,733
没有什么你对付不了的，弗兰基
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

607
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:39,534
波莉，不要碰任何东西
Polly, try not to touch anything.

608
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:43,869
敌舰方位316
4号区域，正在快速靠近
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

609
01:04:44,077 --> 01:04:47,308
- 给我一个图像
- 发射无线电成像仪
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

610
01:04:58,325 --> 01:05:00,816
我们接收到了一个信号
正在屏幕上
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

611
01:05:08,368 --> 01:05:09,858
托滕可夫
Totenkopf.

612
01:05:12,339 --> 01:05:15,831
长官，我们的前进马达已经不能运行了
我们正在下降
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

613
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:19,205
所有的发动机，全速反转
让我们离开这里
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

614
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:21,779
弗兰基，你得让我去那个岛
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

615
01:05:21,982 --> 01:05:25,076
我可不想为了你的愚蠢行为
拿我手下人的生命做赌注
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

616
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:27,310
他抓了德克斯
He's got Dex.

617
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:31,280
取消命令！
Rescind order!

618
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:36,785
从空中你永远都没办法
我们得另辟蹊径
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

619
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:43,935
在岛的东面有潮汐涌动
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

620
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:47,368
太深了
我们不能下潜超过300米
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

621
01:05:47,974 --> 01:05:49,271
但是...
But...

622
01:05:50,443 --> 01:05:51,967
...这块区域
...this area here,

623
01:05:52,178 --> 01:05:53,941
在南端有个海底入口
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

624
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:58,584
它穿越了整个岛屿
这是你唯一的路径
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

625
01:05:58,852 --> 01:06:01,047
其他的岛岸都是岩石
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

626
01:06:01,254 --> 01:06:03,620
那这些机器人怎么办？
我们怎么通过？
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

627
01:06:03,823 --> 01:06:05,256
这个问题我来解决
Leave that to me.

628
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,457
通知两栖机组做好战斗准备
Alert the amphibious squadron.

629
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,367
前往母舰做好战斗准备
Report to main station carrier.

630
01:06:54,107 --> 01:06:55,369
什么？
What?

631
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:56,769
南京？
Nanjing?

632
01:06:57,944 --> 01:07:00,242
我听不清你在说什么,波莉
I can't hear you, Polly.

633
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,977
你得说大声点
You'll have to speak up.

634
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:26,764
保持机头向上，约瑟夫
你的短程起飞总是很差
Keep your nose up, Joseph. You
always were bad at the short takeoff.

635
01:07:26,973 --> 01:07:29,703
小心，弗兰基
我可不想回来帮你
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

636
01:07:33,113 --> 01:07:35,581
我认为你刚才的起飞很棒
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

637
01:07:36,015 --> 01:07:37,175
谢谢，波莉
Thank you, Polly.

638
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,315
那你刚才听见了，没错吧？
So you heard that, did you?

639
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,687
曼塔队长呼叫曼塔机组
10秒后入水
Manta leader to Manta team,
impact in ten seconds.

640
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:48,588
切换到两栖模式
Switching to amphibious mode.

641
01:07:57,971 --> 01:08:00,940
入水倒计时开始5，4，3
Impact in five, four, three,

642
01:08:01,141 --> 01:08:03,268
2，1
two, one.

643
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:30,661
弗兰基
Franky.

644
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:33,930
你还记得我们在上海的勤务飞行
没忘记吧？
You remember our milk run
over Shanghai, don't you?

645
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,608
我们锁定了目标但是他被高射炮火击中了
We had the target buttoned up
and he was jinxing in the flak.

646
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:40,108
- 一颗铆钉砰地跳出来,以为他被击中了
- 然后开始大叫:
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

647
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:41,712
- 保护长机！
- 保护长机！
- "Protect the rabbits!
- "Protect the rabbits!

648
01:08:41,915 --> 01:08:44,440
- 保护长机！
- 保护长机！
- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"

649
01:08:55,094 --> 01:09:00,054
敌人目标出现在右方四点处
深度1600，小心
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

650
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:14,713
约瑟夫，小心！
Joe, watch out!

651
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:59,654
- 约瑟夫，入口在那里
- 我看见了
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

652
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:06,393
准备好冲进去
我们会为你清除路障
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

653
01:10:12,639 --> 01:10:14,664
抓牢了，波莉
抓住
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

654
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:16,703
曼塔队长呼叫曼塔机组
Manta leader to Manta team,

655
01:10:16,909 --> 01:10:20,174
准备发射集束鱼雷
瞄准中心部分
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

656
01:10:22,815 --> 01:10:23,782
发射
Fire.

657
01:10:37,997 --> 01:10:40,192
约瑟夫！拉起来！
Joseph! Pull up!

658
01:10:52,445 --> 01:10:54,936
约瑟夫，它还活着，快离开
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

659
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,283
收到了吗？快离开
Do you hear me? Disengage.

660
01:11:00,286 --> 01:11:01,514
收到了吗？
Do you hear me?

661
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:04,519
- 这是什么？
- 收到了吗？拉起来！
- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!

662
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:07,454
- 舵被卡住了，我无法控制方向
- 约瑟夫！
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

663
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,858
快离开！
Disengage!

664
01:11:28,648 --> 01:11:31,412
- 谢谢你，弗兰基，刚刚差点被击中
- 准备好冲刺
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

665
01:11:31,617 --> 01:11:32,982
准备好给他点颜色看看
You're only going to have
one shot at this.

666
01:11:33,186 --> 01:11:35,245
弗兰基，你在干吗？
现在不是炫耀你技术的时候
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

667
01:11:35,455 --> 01:11:37,389
- 她朝着它笔直飞过去了
- 没错
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

668
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:39,415
- 她准备撞它了
- 这是自杀啊
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

669
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:41,490
弗兰基,拉起来
Franky, pull up.

670
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:44,959
- 3
- 拉起来，弗兰基
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

671
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:04,148
路障清除完毕
You're all clear.

672
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:06,616
祝你好运，约瑟夫
Good luck, Joe.

673
01:12:06,953 --> 01:12:09,615
谢谢你，弗兰基
接下来该我们表演了
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

674
01:12:10,823 --> 01:12:12,154
她真棒
She's some kind of girl.

675
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:14,485
是的，我知道
Yes, I know.

676
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:38,016
我们正在上升
I'm taking us up.

677
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:33,569
什么？
What?

678
01:13:38,845 --> 01:13:43,043
- 这是什么？
- 托滕可夫创造的生物之一
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

679
01:13:58,197 --> 01:14:02,224
- 你不准备拍它吗？
- 我只剩下两张底片了
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

680
01:14:02,435 --> 01:14:04,596
鬼知道等会儿还会有什么东西
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

681
01:14:04,804 --> 01:14:06,795
随你的便
Suit yourself.

682
01:14:09,342 --> 01:14:12,675
前面有清理过的痕迹
托滕可夫就在附近
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

683
01:14:35,768 --> 01:14:37,065
快跑
Run.

684
01:14:48,548 --> 01:14:49,845
那边
There.

685
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:07,998
波莉！
Polly!

686
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:16,201
哦，还真不赖
Oh, great.

687
01:15:17,843 --> 01:15:19,333
快跑！
Come on!

688
01:15:21,514 --> 01:15:22,481
波莉！
Polly!

689
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:25,973
快点！
Come on!

690
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:36,829
你疯了吗？
Are you mad?

691
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:37,659
你是不是疯了？
Are you mad?

692
01:15:37,863 --> 01:15:42,027
你脑子是不是有毛病？
刚才你差点就害得自己被杀掉了！
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

693
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:49,406
- 算了算了
- 哦，没关系
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

694
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:51,907
- 我的意思不是
- 我刚才拍的是地面！
- I didn't mean--
- I shot the ground!

695
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:55,971
- 什么？
- 当我们在逃跑的时候
- What?
- When we were running,

696
01:15:56,182 --> 01:15:59,083
我拍了地面
I shot the ground.

697
01:16:03,656 --> 01:16:05,556
这个一点也不好笑
It isn't funny.

698
01:16:07,593 --> 01:16:12,690
我只剩下一张底片了
一张！
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

699
01:16:19,572 --> 01:16:22,439
那个鬼相机对你来说有什么意义？
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

700
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,532
是你送给我的
You gave it to me.

701
01:16:27,613 --> 01:16:29,240
连你自己也不记得了？
You don't even remember, do you?

702
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:33,141
当你和美国志愿者在南京开着飞机的时候
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

703
01:16:33,352 --> 01:16:35,912
我正在报道上海的撤退
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

704
01:16:36,455 --> 01:16:38,252
- 我记得的
- 约瑟夫，我想问你几个问题
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

705
01:16:38,457 --> 01:16:39,856
你得老实回答我的问题
and I want you to tell me the truth.

706
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:43,926
我发誓我不在乎答案是什么
我只是想知道真相
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

707
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:46,224
你在南京的女友是弗兰基
对吗？
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

708
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:49,458
- 波莉
- 你和她在一起呆了多久？
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

709
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,228
看着我的眼睛
Look me in the eyes.

710
01:16:53,806 --> 01:16:56,240
我从来没有让你戴过绿帽子
I never fooled around on you.

711
01:16:56,442 --> 01:16:57,409
从来没有
Never.

712
01:17:00,346 --> 01:17:02,246
是我破坏了你的飞机
I sabotaged your plane.

713
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,774
- 三个月
- 我就知道！
- Three months.
- I knew it!

714
01:17:05,985 --> 01:17:08,818
我不敢想象我怎么才能相信你
你这个可恶的
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy--

715
01:17:13,492 --> 01:17:15,187
他在这里
He's here.

716
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:27,733
你没事吧？
You all right?

717
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:44,987
从这里走
Through there.

718
01:17:51,731 --> 01:17:52,698
从这里走
Through there.

719
01:18:53,259 --> 01:18:54,658
我的天啊，约瑟夫
My God, Joe.

720
01:18:55,995 --> 01:18:57,656
是诺亚方舟
It's an ark.

721
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:00,195
他在建一个诺亚方舟
He's building an ark.

722
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:12,004
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

723
01:19:14,013 --> 01:19:16,675
你认为还有比把地球上所有的
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

724
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:20,010
生物成双成对的
放在这个巨大的火箭船里面
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

725
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:22,551
更为壮观的场景吗？
inside a giant rocket ship?

726
01:19:23,155 --> 01:19:24,782
我也许还能发现更壮观的
I might.

727
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:28,817
- 比如说？
- 当我看见的时候就知道了
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

728
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:40,600
- 离起飞还有10分钟
- 他们开始倒计时了
- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.

729
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:43,206
我们得找到托滕可夫
We have to find Totenkopf.

730
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:54,579
这下你中奖了
You've got a gift.

731
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:21,739
- 德克斯！
- 快点，进来！
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

732
01:20:26,652 --> 01:20:27,812
上来
科姆，快走！
Einsteigen. Komm, springt!

733
01:20:35,361 --> 01:20:36,919
你们都还好吧？
你怎么找到我们的？
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

734
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:39,188
倒计时开始的时候我们逃进了隧道
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

735
01:20:39,398 --> 01:20:42,026
还有一些科学家没能逃出来
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

736
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:46,167
看守我们的那些机器人
The machines that were guarding us

737
01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:48,340
正在把这个岛上的所有东西装上船
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

738
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,838
我们只有大约十分钟时间来阻止
飞船点火起飞
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

739
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:55,879
德克斯！ 带我们离开这里！
Dex! Get us out of here!

740
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:20,569
干得好，德克斯
Good boy, Dex.

741
01:21:21,473 --> 01:21:22,735
谢谢，上尉
Thanks, Cap.

742
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:29,076
- 他们是谁？
- 他们是11单元
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 1 1.

743
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:30,373
也可以说是11单元的幸存者
Or what's left of them.

744
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:33,608
他们被带到这里完成一个30年前的计划
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

745
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:35,081
完成什么？
Finish what?

746
01:21:35,454 --> 01:21:36,421
告诉他们
Tell them.

747
01:21:36,622 --> 01:21:39,682
托滕可夫认为人类注定要灭亡
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

748
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:41,519
所以他不可思议的提出了：
so he proposed the unthinkable:

749
01:21:41,727 --> 01:21:45,163
建造一个装置把另外一个文明所需的
基础单元
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

750
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:46,331
送入太空
into space.

751
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:48,523
他利用他的机器人
He used his machines
to collect specimens

752
01:21:48,734 --> 01:21:50,395
把地球上的所有物种放在一起
representing all life on Earth.

753
01:21:50,602 --> 01:21:52,194
托滕可夫称之为“明日帝国”
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

754
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:55,202
詹宁斯博士给我的那些管子是什么？
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

755
01:21:55,407 --> 01:21:57,705
亚当和夏娃
托滕可夫的杰作
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

756
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:00,174
科技乌托邦的星星之火
Seeds of a technological utopia.

757
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:01,778
我们偷偷的把他们带出了这个小岛
We smuggled them off this island,

758
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:03,778
因为我们知道托滕可夫没有他们
是不会离开的
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

759
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:07,544
但是现在他再次得到了他们
没有任何东西可以把他留在这里了
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

760
01:22:07,753 --> 01:22:10,449
既然这样让他走好了
在太空他也不能伤害任何人
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

761
01:22:10,656 --> 01:22:13,284
不行，那艘船永远都不能离开地球
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

762
01:22:13,492 --> 01:22:15,392
为什么？你还有什么没有告诉我们？
Why? What haven't you told us?

763
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:18,791
当飞船到达100公里高度的太空边缘时
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

764
01:22:18,998 --> 01:22:21,762
- 地球会被毁灭掉的
- 我们怎么阻止它？
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

765
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:24,731
现在只有托滕可夫可以阻止它
但是我们永远都无法靠近他
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

766
01:22:24,937 --> 01:22:27,030
他的防卫措施很好，见他的面都很困难
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

767
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:29,799
- 他在哪里？
- 我们正在去找他，上尉
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

768
01:22:30,109 --> 01:22:31,269
干得好，德克斯
Good boy, Dex.

769
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:37,575
小心，小心
Careful. Careful.

770
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:42,653
快点，他们会来追我们的
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

771
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,725
从那里走
那是唯一的途径
Through there.
That's the only way in.

772
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:53,227
你们都看见没有其他的路了
You see, there is no way past them.

773
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:55,667
只有5分钟了，约瑟夫
Five minutes, Joe.

774
01:22:56,869 --> 01:22:58,700
- 在这里等我
- 你会死的
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

775
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:01,330
他知道自己在干什么
He knows what he's doing.

776
01:23:03,976 --> 01:23:05,068
我想
I think.

777
01:23:09,982 --> 01:23:10,949
嘿，那是我的枪！
Hey, that's my gun!

778
01:23:16,522 --> 01:23:17,716
- 德克斯？
- 试着摇一摇
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

779
01:23:25,764 --> 01:23:29,131
- 我们得快点
- 不要过去，白痴！
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

780
01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:30,631
博士，不要过去！
Doctor, stop!

781
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,545
谁这么大胆到我这里来了？
Who dares come before me?

782
01:23:50,756 --> 01:23:53,020
谁竟然胆敢进到这里来了？
Who dares enter this place?

783
01:23:53,225 --> 01:23:56,456
已经开始的就无法结束
What has begun
cannot be stopped.

784
01:23:56,662 --> 01:23:59,995
- 是时候结束这个万恶的世界了
- 托滕可夫
- The time for this world is over.
- T otenkopf.

785
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:01,461
嘿，博士
Hello, doctor.

786
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:03,134
你为什么这样做？
Why are you doing this?

787
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:06,304
我见证了一个充满了憎恨的世界
I have been witness to a world
consumed by hatred

788
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:08,803
不断走向自我的灭亡
and bent on self-destruction.

789
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:12,306
我们作为这个星球的一员却不负责任
Watched as we have taken
what was to be a paradise

790
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:15,810
导致这个往日的天堂在不断堕落
and failed in our responsibilities
as its steward.

791
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:19,245
我很清楚人类为自己设定的轨迹
I know now that the course
the human race has set for itself

792
01:24:19,551 --> 01:24:21,485
是无法改变的
cannot be changed.

793
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:25,919
我是这个注定要灭亡的星球的最后希望
I am the last, desperate chance
for a doomed planet.

794
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:28,821
现在，不离开这里就是死路一条！
Now, leave this place or die!

795
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:37,899
- 现在安全吗？
- 呃，只有一个办法来确认了
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

796
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:50,914
我的意思是丢点东西上去
I meant throw something.

797
01:25:13,105 --> 01:25:14,367
他不在这里
He's not here.

798
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,307
我们来晚了
We're too late.

799
01:25:16,508 --> 01:25:18,203
这些是他的私人文件
These are his personal papers.

800
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:21,902
他不会丢下这些东西的
他一定还在这里
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

801
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:24,776
- 我们得找到他
- 我找到他了
- We must find him.
- I found him.

802
01:25:39,831 --> 01:25:40,991
不可能是这样得
It's impossible.

803
01:25:42,234 --> 01:25:43,496
不能这样
It can't be.

804
01:25:43,702 --> 01:25:47,069
他日记上的最后一次记录是在
10月11日，1918
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 1 1, 1 91 8.

805
01:25:47,306 --> 01:25:48,933
他20年前就死了
He died over 20 years ago.

806
01:25:55,814 --> 01:25:57,611
我们一直在寻找一个幽灵
We've been chasing a ghost.

807
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:12,763
还有3分钟时间起飞
Three minutes to liftoff.

808
01:26:18,837 --> 01:26:21,305
没有办法阻止他们了
他们正在按照程序完成整个计划
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

809
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:26,876
你难道没看见？整个岛就是托滕可夫
每根管线，每套设备
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

810
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:30,048
连他的死也是在欺骗我们
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

811
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:33,241
我们怎么杀死一个已经死了的人？
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

812
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,049
- 我怎样才能阻止它？
- 现在没有任何东西能够阻止它了
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

813
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:39,622
- 一定有什么办法
- 他的机器人不会允许你这么做的
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

814
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:42,157
我来解决这些机器人
德克斯，告诉我怎么做
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

815
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:47,690
如果你切断系统终端的导航部分
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

816
01:26:47,899 --> 01:26:50,197
会引起短路...
it should create a short...

817
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:54,998
可以在助推发动机点火前
点燃燃料管线
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

818
01:26:55,207 --> 01:26:56,970
- 来破坏发动机点火的气氛
- 就这样？
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

819
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:01,877
- 这就是我所要做的？
- 但是终端在飞船上面
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

820
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,412
你将没有时间逃离
You won't have time to escape.

821
01:27:07,819 --> 01:27:09,980
你们离开这个岛后
马上和弗兰基取得联系
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

822
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:12,952
- 她知道该怎么办
- 你们在讲些什么？
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

823
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:15,683
- 我要和你一起去
- 这次不行
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

824
01:27:15,894 --> 01:27:17,885
我们说好了的
We had a deal.

825
01:27:18,563 --> 01:27:21,589
你不能在事情变得有趣的时候离开我
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

826
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:28,300
- 我不会让你一个人走的
- 我希望我们要是有更多时间就好了
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

827
01:27:28,507 --> 01:27:31,670
现在我只是希望，有那么一天
你能原谅我
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

828
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:43,087
- 照顾好她，德克斯
- 祝你好运，上尉
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

829
01:27:50,662 --> 01:27:53,062
一分钟后起飞
One minute to liftoff.

830
01:28:07,446 --> 01:28:09,539
我们又见面了
我神秘的朋友
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

831
01:28:12,851 --> 01:28:13,875
你要怎么样？
How do you wanna do this?

832
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,950
干得好,波莉
Nice shot, Polly.

833
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:36,493
你怎么这么久才来？
What took you so long?

834
01:29:40,872 --> 01:29:42,032
她是机器人
She's a machine.

835
01:29:49,247 --> 01:29:51,875
10秒后起飞
Ten seconds to liftoff.

836
01:30:50,976 --> 01:30:52,739
我们得把这些动物弄下飞船
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

837
01:30:52,944 --> 01:30:55,139
90公里后发动机点火
Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.

838
01:30:55,347 --> 01:30:56,609
没时间了
There's no time.

839
01:31:01,052 --> 01:31:02,576
这是我们过去的唯一途径
That's our only way across.

840
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,860
80公里后发动机点火
Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.

841
01:31:19,037 --> 01:31:22,598
危险！危险！危险！
飞船货物即将卸下！
Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!

842
01:31:23,074 --> 01:31:24,769
你刚才做什么了？
What did you do now?

843
01:31:29,047 --> 01:31:30,014
快来！
Come on!

844
01:31:30,215 --> 01:31:32,843
70公里后发动机点火
Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.

845
01:31:45,764 --> 01:31:47,664
60公里后发动机点火
Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.

846
01:31:50,902 --> 01:31:52,494
抓牢！
Hold on!

847
01:31:59,244 --> 01:32:02,975
天啊！不要再碰任何东西了！
Please! Don't touch anything else!

848
01:32:11,156 --> 01:32:13,647
没时间了，我们无法阻止它了
There's no time. We'll never make it.

849
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:17,557
50公里后发动机点火
Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.

850
01:32:25,303 --> 01:32:26,327
快跑！
Run!

851
01:32:27,806 --> 01:32:30,206
40公里后发动机点火
Forty kilometers to booster ignition.

852
01:32:37,949 --> 01:32:40,247
请求进入，曼塔基地
你收到我的消息了吗？
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

853
01:32:42,787 --> 01:32:45,654
30公里后发动机点火
Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.

854
01:32:49,794 --> 01:32:51,989
弗兰基，我是德克斯
你能收到我的消息吗？
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

855
01:33:01,272 --> 01:33:02,239
这样没用
It didn't work.

856
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:07,778
20公里后发动机点火
Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.

857
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,645
约瑟夫，你没时间了
你得想点办法
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

858
01:33:13,184 --> 01:33:17,120
上帝看见地球上恶人横行
And God saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth...

859
01:33:17,322 --> 01:33:20,257
- 他以为自己是上帝
- 上帝告诉诺亚，末日...
- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...

860
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,755
住嘴！
Shut up!

861
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,554
10公里后发动机点火
Ten kilometers to booster ignition.

862
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:32,761
- 6
- 你怎么还不去死？
-...six...
- Why won't you die?

863
01:33:32,971 --> 01:33:35,098
5公里后发动机点火
Five kilometers to booster ignition.

864
01:33:49,454 --> 01:33:51,752
警告，系统故障
Warning. System failure.

865
01:33:52,157 --> 01:33:53,784
发动机故障
Booster malfunction.

866
01:33:53,992 --> 01:33:56,051
危险，危险
Danger. Danger.

867
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:57,421
危险
Danger.

868
01:33:57,629 --> 01:34:00,154
警告，系统故障
Warning. System failure.

869
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:01,593
- 发动机故障
- 小心！
- Booster malfunction.
- Look!

870
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,265
危险，危险
Danger. Danger.

871
01:34:03,468 --> 01:34:06,232
- 这是什么？
- 也许是我们的逃生之路
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.

872
01:34:23,988 --> 01:34:25,922
我看见他们了，长官
I see them, commander.

873
01:34:26,424 --> 01:34:30,383
攻击分队预备
所有船员做好准备
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.

874
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,311
最后一张
One shot.

875
01:35:27,418 --> 01:35:29,147
你得到了你的新闻了
You got your story.

876
01:35:46,905 --> 01:35:48,429
波莉
Polly.

877
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:50,908
- 你...
- 没关系
- You...
- It's all right.

878
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:53,373
你不需要说什么
You don't have to say anything.

879
01:35:56,114 --> 01:35:57,877
你的相机盖没有开
Lens cap.
