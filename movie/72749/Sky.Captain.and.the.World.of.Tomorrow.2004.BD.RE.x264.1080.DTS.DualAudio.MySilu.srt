1
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:09,441
<i>Attention. Please prepare
for docking procedure.</i>

2
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,181
<i>There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.</i>

3
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:34,190
They didn't leave a name.

4
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:36,296
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

5
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,996
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

6
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,899
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

7
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:23,135
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

8
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:29,984
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

9
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,812
You don't like my smile?

10
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,386
I don't like what's behind it.

11
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:39,451
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

12
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:43,529
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

13
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,901
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

14
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,835
I'll bring you some popcorn.

15
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:05,769
<i>Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

16
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:08,609
<i>We must be over the rainbow.</i>

17
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,713
You sent me this?

18
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:19,454
Who are you?

19
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,629
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

20
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,733
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

21
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,233
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

22
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:31,531
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which...

23
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,334
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

24
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:37,812
Yes, l...

25
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,142
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

26
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:45,676
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

27
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:49,949
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

28
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,687
<i>It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."</i>

29
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:58,264
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

30
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,527
The things we were made
to do there...

31
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,829
Terrible things.

32
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:09,234
<i>- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.</i>

33
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:13,938
<i>Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?</i>

34
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,014
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

35
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:17,913
Yes.

36
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,846
Don't you see?

37
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:23,851
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

38
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:25,659
Me.

39
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,561
He's coming for me.

40
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,526
Who? Who's coming?

41
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,030
Totenkopf.

42
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,432
It's Totenkopf.

43
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,258
There!

44
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,930
<i>All citizens, attention.</i>

45
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,042
<i>New York City
must be evacuated at once.</i>

46
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:19,578
<i>Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.</i>

47
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:23,547
<i>All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty</i>

48
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:27,279
<i>shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.</i>

49
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:28,888
<i>This is urgent.</i>

50
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:38,292
<i>- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.</i>

51
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,695
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

52
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:42,631
<i>Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.</i>

53
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:46,638
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

54
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:48,139
and someone named Totenkopf.

55
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,278
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

56
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,345
Totenkopf. Who is he?

57
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,311
<i>He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.</i>

58
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:57,178
Quick as you can.

59
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,513
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

60
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,814
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

61
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:03,321
and get the hell out of there.

62
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,152
Wait a minute.

63
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:10,264
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

64
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,198
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

65
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,530
Fifth Avenue.

66
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:19,070
They're a hundred...
They're a hundred yards away.

67
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,435
Polly. Polly!

68
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,172
Oh, my God.

69
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,676
Polly!

70
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:26,848
Polly!

71
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:28,849
<i>Polly!</i>

72
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,145
Stop! Come back!

73
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,157
Fire!

74
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:22,360
Get out of here!

75
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:25,301
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

76
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:26,496
Send everything you've got!

77
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:31,370
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

78
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,072
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

79
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:38,515
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

80
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,211
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

81
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:43,983
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

82
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,820
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

83
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,361
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

84
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,627
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

85
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:58,272
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

86
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,014
Polly.

87
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:32,819
Joe.

88
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:45,029
<i>Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.</i>

89
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:49,429
<i>The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication</i>

90
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:52,232
<i>due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.</i>

91
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,341
<i>Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies</i>

92
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,774
<i>now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.</i>

93
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,177
<i>The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg</i>

94
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:03,749
<i>was virtually excavated</i>

95
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:07,581
<i>by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.</i>

96
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,919
<i>News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines</i>

97
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,355
<i>rising from the ground,</i>

98
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:17,395
<i>robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.</i>

99
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:21,697
<i>Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,</i>

100
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:23,894
<i>world leaders
must once again call upon</i>

101
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:28,007
<i>the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire</i>

102
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,646
<i>to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.</i>

103
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,430
Where's Dex?

104
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,940
Shazam.

105
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:31,894
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

106
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,234
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

107
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:38,539
Oh, I need to show you something.

108
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:43,000
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

109
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:46,246
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

110
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,584
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

111
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:53,515
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

112
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:56,212
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

113
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,483
I think it's being used
to control them.

114
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,354
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

115
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,161
I can try, yeah.

116
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:03,660
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

117
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:07,392
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

118
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,934
Find out what makes it tick.

119
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:13,906
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

120
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,206
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

121
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:28,086
<i>Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.</i>

122
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,075
Tummy ache?

123
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,518
How you been, Joe?

124
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,688
- Miss me?
- Get out.

125
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,254
Well, it's nice to see you too.

126
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:10,924
Dex said you might be in a mood.

127
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,497
Dex?

128
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,065
Get in here!

129
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:19,400
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

130
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,438
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

131
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,235
You sabotaged my plane.

132
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,242
Right.

133
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:30,884
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

134
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:33,818
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

135
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:37,690
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

136
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:41,055
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

137
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:42,820
in his bathrobe, remember?

138
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:44,396
You know, I'm starting to think

139
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,567
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

140
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:48,895
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

141
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:51,663
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

142
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:54,068
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

143
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:56,266
Who was she, Joe?

144
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:59,035
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

145
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:00,737
What are you gonna do?

146
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:03,614
Shoot me?

147
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:08,187
Oh, great. We all made up.

148
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,624
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

149
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:14,852
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

150
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,894
If she resists, shoot her.

151
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:18,429
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

152
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,726
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

153
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:22,402
Okay.

154
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:27,040
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

155
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:30,611
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

156
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,643
Lots more.

157
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:40,954
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

158
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:43,453
And you're gonna help me get it.

159
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:46,490
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

160
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:49,522
Show me what?

161
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:57,169
Show me what?

162
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,712
My God. What is this?

163
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,648
Where do they come from?

164
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:19,221
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

165
00:22:19,427 --> 00:22:22,089
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

166
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,955
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

167
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,532
and then they disappear
without a trace.

168
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:29,893
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

169
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:31,537
or who's sending them here.

170
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:34,367
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

171
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:37,772
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

172
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:41,244
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

173
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:42,939
Totenkopf.

174
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,016
He nearly went white
when he said it.

175
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:47,483
Totenkopf, who is he?

176
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:50,054
He's the invisible man.

177
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:53,819
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

178
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:57,293
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

179
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:59,193
This is the only thing I could dig up.

180
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:04,567
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

181
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:06,535
before the start of World War I.

182
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:08,902
Something called Unit 11.

183
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,238
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

184
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,512
Until today.

185
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:17,684
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

186
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:21,149
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

187
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,419
The scientist, where is he now?

188
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:30,224
We're in this together, right, Joe?

189
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:36,561
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

190
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:39,399
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

191
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:41,938
Understood.

192
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:57,748
What?

193
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,350
I missed you.

194
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:05,789
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

195
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,533
Were you down there?

196
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:13,500
You missed me too. How nice.

197
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:20,042
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

198
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:31,751
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

199
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:35,525
Dr. Jennings!

200
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,459
It's locked.

201
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,296
That window there.

202
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,574
I may be able to get in
through that window

203
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:50,767
if I can attach a line...

204
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,474
It's open.

205
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:13,163
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

206
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,146
All right, Polly...

207
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:03,079
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

208
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:05,912
I was hoping you could tell me.

209
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:12,523
Dr. Jennings!

210
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,661
You must stop him!

211
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:19,660
Stay here.

212
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,403
Stop!

213
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:34,007
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:09,675
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

215
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:13,342
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

216
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:17,283
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

217
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:21,052
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

218
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,251
Promise.

219
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:39,670
He's dead.

220
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,876
I think I found something.

221
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:49,652
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

222
00:27:55,162 --> 00:27:58,154
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

223
00:27:58,366 --> 00:27:59,799
Of course you are.

224
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:19,079
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

225
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:20,480
and coming straight for us.

226
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:23,680
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

227
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:32,723
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

228
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:06,057
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

229
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,997
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

230
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:11,103
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

231
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:13,535
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

232
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,073
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

233
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:17,244
Go, go, go!

234
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:22,982
Get in.

235
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:45,362
There you are.

236
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,276
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

237
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,709
Come in, Dex.

238
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:04,190
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

239
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:09,061
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

240
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,029
<i>- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,</i>

241
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:12,529
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

242
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:13,893
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

243
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,594
Which machine is it, Dex?

244
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,769
<i>There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.</i>

245
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:26,804
I think I found it, Dex.

246
00:30:35,322 --> 00:30:38,485
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

247
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:41,183
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

248
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:42,828
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

249
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:45,232
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

250
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:46,729
<i>I'll let you know. Out.</i>

251
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,776
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

252
00:30:57,978 --> 00:31:00,412
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

253
00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:16,120
They've come back
for the generators.

254
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:18,289
Who is this guy?

255
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,337
- You okay?
- Great.

256
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:30,135
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

257
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,642
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

258
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:33,938
Pull up!

259
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:49,789
- Joe!
- I see it!

260
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:56,903
It's getting away.

261
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,166
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

262
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,810
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

263
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:13,316
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

264
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:16,954
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

265
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:23,955
Hey!

266
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:32,563
Okay, okay, now go straight.

267
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:34,832
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

268
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,174
Back there.

269
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:48,120
I could use a little more warning
next time.

270
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:49,289
Go left!

271
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:57,463
Tell me you got something, Dex.

272
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:00,495
<i>We're getting clobbered up here.</i>

273
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:04,193
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

274
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:09,739
Joe!

275
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:24,384
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

276
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:26,286
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

277
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:28,552
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

278
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:35,260
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

279
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:39,528
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

280
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,935
Will you just trust me? Go left!

281
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:49,849
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

282
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,017
It's a dead end!

283
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:55,610
There's no way out!

284
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:58,324
Oh, bugger.

285
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:09,094
Joe!

286
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:32,715
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

287
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,588
I got us here, didn't I?

288
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,964
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

289
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:44,933
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

290
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,098
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

291
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,078
Still glad you came?

292
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:09,462
Joe, I found it! Joe!

293
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:12,960
<i>Dex, come in. Where is it?</i>

294
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:21,503
<i>Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?</i>

295
00:35:24,778 --> 00:35:26,177
<i>Dex, do you read me?</i>

296
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,051
<i>Dex, are you there?</i>

297
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,320
I can't outrun them much longer.

298
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:16,588
Hold on.

299
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,066
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

300
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,703
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

301
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:27,772
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

302
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:31,541
Joe, you have to pull up!

303
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:41,716
Pull up!

304
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:01,566
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

305
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:03,538
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

306
00:37:14,154 --> 00:37:15,678
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

307
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,551
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

308
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:21,489
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

309
00:37:22,763 --> 00:37:26,062
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

310
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:29,099
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

311
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:31,768
Oh, I can take it.

312
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:35,870
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

313
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:37,304
Because that was nothing.

314
00:37:54,962 --> 00:37:57,430
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

315
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,631
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

316
00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:23,914
Dex!

317
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,521
Dex!

318
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:32,856
Dex.

319
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:55,184
They're everywhere.

320
00:38:57,691 --> 00:38:59,056
Joe, look out!

321
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,532
Dex!

322
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:01,286
Why would Totenkopf do this?

323
00:40:03,323 --> 00:40:05,814
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

324
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:15,190
He was looking for something.

325
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:23,133
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

326
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:26,108
He must have got too close.

327
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,630
- He was trying to tell me something...
- Joe.

328
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,242
Good boy, Dex.

329
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:55,263
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

330
00:41:55,468 --> 00:41:59,336
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

331
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:02,070
- My God.
- What?

332
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:05,711
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 12 years old.

333
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:09,379
By 17, he had already received
two doctorates

334
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,848
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

335
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:17,012
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

336
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:19,283
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

337
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:22,791
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

338
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:25,294
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

339
00:42:25,498 --> 00:42:29,127
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

340
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:31,827
Even less is known
about his companion,

341
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:34,268
an assassin who controls
his machines."

342
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:35,964
She's the one who took Dex.

343
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:38,611
What else?

344
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,881
These are Unit 11 supply logs.

345
00:42:46,086 --> 00:42:48,020
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

346
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:51,657
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

347
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:54,884
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

348
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:59,223
What have you been up to, doctor?

349
00:43:11,911 --> 00:43:14,573
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

350
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,517
We'll find him.

351
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:00,953
My old friend Joe.

352
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:01,861
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

353
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:04,193
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

354
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:08,026
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

355
00:44:08,268 --> 00:44:09,895
Nice to meet you.

356
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:17,309
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

357
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,444
Did you get a little something
for me?

358
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:23,844
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

359
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,817
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

360
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:31,149
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

361
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:41,060
Come, I'll show you the maps.

362
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:47,338
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

363
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,340
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

364
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:53,175
I don't trust him.

365
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,110
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

366
00:44:57,417 --> 00:45:01,444
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

367
00:45:01,654 --> 00:45:04,487
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

368
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:17,568
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

369
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:20,271
This is where
the transmission originated.

370
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,907
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

371
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:27,041
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

372
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,877
It is forbidden.

373
00:45:29,082 --> 00:45:32,779
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

374
00:45:32,986 --> 00:45:35,546
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

375
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:38,519
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

376
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:40,919
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

377
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:45,722
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

378
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:48,594
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

379
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:51,236
Why? Why is this place so special?

380
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:55,204
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

381
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:58,241
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

382
00:45:58,445 --> 00:46:01,642
You may know it as Shangri-la.

383
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,448
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

384
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:14,322
I need to send a message.

385
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:23,429
<i>Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.</i>

386
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:27,538
<i>We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.</i>

387
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,504
<i>The story grows stranger
at every turn.</i>

388
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,975
<i>Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.</i>

389
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,613
<i>I fear time is running out.</i>

390
00:46:36,115 --> 00:46:39,380
<i>With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.</i>

391
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:42,953
<i>I hope. Polly Perkins.</i>

392
00:47:09,782 --> 00:47:12,945
This is where civilization stops.

393
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:15,052
A blank on the map.

394
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:18,855
We must be careful from here.

395
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,192
Hurry.

396
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:50,120
What is it?

397
00:47:50,323 --> 00:47:52,723
It looks like a mining outpost.

398
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:55,520
Something bad happened here.

399
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,567
Seems to be abandoned.

400
00:48:01,768 --> 00:48:03,929
Tell your men we're heading down.

401
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:06,962
I want a closer look.

402
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,881
What is it, Joe?

403
00:48:52,085 --> 00:48:53,279
Uranium.

404
00:48:53,486 --> 00:48:56,182
The whole mine's contaminated.

405
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,156
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

406
00:48:59,726 --> 00:49:00,693
Where's Polly?

407
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:07,126
Polly!

408
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:09,392
Miss Perkins?

409
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:17,034
We'll have to split up.

410
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,518
Polly!

411
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:30,586
Let her go.

412
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:35,617
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

413
00:49:35,828 --> 00:49:37,386
What vials?
What are you talking about?

414
00:49:39,332 --> 00:49:41,163
I will not ask a second time.

415
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,629
Drop the gun.

416
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:54,536
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

417
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:57,045
As you wish.

418
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:00,051
Wait! Wait. Wait.

419
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:11,160
I'm sorry, Joe.

420
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:14,492
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

421
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:28,679
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

422
00:50:29,816 --> 00:50:32,444
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

423
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:36,952
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

424
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:39,556
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

425
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,489
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

426
00:50:42,695 --> 00:50:44,526
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

427
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:49,094
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

428
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:54,296
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

429
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:58,076
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

430
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:00,768
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:03,409
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

432
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,183
Do you hear that?

433
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:23,859
Dynamite.

434
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:27,399
That noise again.

435
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:38,573
Move!

436
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,360
What are you doing?

437
00:51:57,804 --> 00:51:59,169
Come on!

438
00:52:01,174 --> 00:52:02,436
Oh, great.

439
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:04,337
We're safe.

440
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,645
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

441
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:09,781
There's something
I need to ask you.

442
00:52:09,982 --> 00:52:11,176
Yes, Joe?

443
00:52:14,086 --> 00:52:16,145
Did you cut my fuel line?

444
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:20,724
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

445
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,987
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

446
00:52:24,197 --> 00:52:26,358
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

447
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:41,372
There you are.

448
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:44,049
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

449
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:46,418
My film.

450
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,882
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

451
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:08,102
Polly.

452
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:11,736
Polly.

453
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:41,398
My clothes.

454
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:46,308
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

455
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:49,376
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

456
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:53,515
- Oh, don't tell me you're...
- Naked.

457
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:58,181
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

458
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:03,315
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

459
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:08,395
Stop looking at me like that.

460
00:54:09,432 --> 00:54:11,093
Like what?

461
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:15,062
Turn around, Joe.

462
00:54:15,638 --> 00:54:18,129
I'm serious. Turn around.

463
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:25,538
Hi, Joe.

464
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:48,636
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

465
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:53,141
The clothes are burned.

466
00:54:53,342 --> 00:54:55,207
Burned? Why?

467
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:00,539
He says the mine is poisonous.

468
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:01,808
Our clothes were infected.

469
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,615
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

470
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:11,316
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

471
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:14,792
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

472
00:55:22,038 --> 00:55:23,596
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

473
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,371
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

474
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:28,643
It's very important we find this man.

475
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:30,677
His name is Totenkopf!

476
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:37,719
He says, what do you want
with this man?

477
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,785
I've come to kill him.

478
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:41,683
And to find my friend.

479
00:55:46,729 --> 00:55:48,492
He says he will help you.

480
00:55:58,374 --> 00:56:00,205
What do you think?

481
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,439
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

482
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,082
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

483
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:12,117
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

484
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,551
They're waiting for us.

485
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:19,561
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

486
00:56:19,762 --> 00:56:21,821
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

487
00:56:22,031 --> 00:56:24,932
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

488
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:27,159
Where is Totenkopf now?

489
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:31,306
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

490
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:38,273
I can't believe this is happening.

491
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:42,944
I only have two shots left.

492
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:47,018
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

493
00:56:47,223 --> 00:56:48,588
Everything I had was in that bag.

494
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,349
You should have let me go back
for my film.

495
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,790
You're right, I should have.

496
00:56:58,568 --> 00:57:00,058
So where's he taking us?

497
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:04,729
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

498
00:57:04,941 --> 00:57:06,670
What experiments?

499
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:23,386
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

500
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:32,935
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

501
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:36,127
To make him pay
for what he has done.

502
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:50,083
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

503
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:55,389
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

504
00:57:57,093 --> 00:58:00,324
Rana? Is there such a place?

505
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,236
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

506
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:11,234
Of course. Anything.

507
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:17,410
What do you want?

508
00:58:21,717 --> 00:58:23,981
Kill me.

509
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,524
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

510
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:41,693
And there's a moon and a star.

511
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:50,044
<i>And all I ask is a tall ship</i>

512
00:58:50,813 --> 00:58:54,305
<i>and a star to steer her by</i>

513
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:57,252
A star.

514
00:58:57,453 --> 00:59:00,547
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

515
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:02,883
Rana is a star.

516
00:59:03,225 --> 00:59:07,286
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

517
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:11,159
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

518
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:12,768
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

519
00:59:12,768 --> 00:59:15,532
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

520
00:59:15,738 --> 00:59:18,571
latitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

521
00:59:18,774 --> 00:59:23,211
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

522
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:24,902
You mean this could really work?

523
00:59:25,114 --> 00:59:27,912
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

524
00:59:28,117 --> 00:59:30,108
We do things a little
different nowadays.

525
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,311
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

526
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:35,217
- March 2.
- March 2.

527
00:59:35,424 --> 00:59:39,520
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

528
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:42,397
March 2...

529
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:48,897
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

530
00:59:49,805 --> 00:59:56,540
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

531
00:59:56,979 --> 01:00:01,746
Declination, minus 10.60.

532
01:00:07,056 --> 01:00:09,115
There's nothing there.

533
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:11,520
Are you sure you did it right?

534
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:13,456
I'm sure.

535
01:00:14,163 --> 01:00:17,030
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

536
01:00:17,233 --> 01:00:19,360
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

537
01:00:29,678 --> 01:00:31,509
What's that point there?

538
01:00:31,714 --> 01:00:33,579
That's where we run out of fuel.

539
01:00:33,783 --> 01:00:35,444
Oh, great.

540
01:00:37,553 --> 01:00:38,884
So how do we get there?

541
01:00:42,858 --> 01:00:45,326
- Franky.
- Who?

542
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:48,829
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

543
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,329
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

544
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:54,796
If I can get a message to them,

545
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:57,802
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

546
01:00:58,974 --> 01:01:00,407
And what if they don't
get the message?

547
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:03,737
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

548
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:07,139
They'll be there.

549
01:01:23,365 --> 01:01:25,526
Is that light supposed to be on?

550
01:01:25,734 --> 01:01:27,258
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

551
01:01:28,737 --> 01:01:31,900
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

552
01:01:35,077 --> 01:01:37,102
Manta Station, do you read me?

553
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:40,078
Where are you, Franky?

554
01:01:45,387 --> 01:01:46,547
What are you doing?

555
01:01:47,056 --> 01:01:49,820
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

556
01:01:50,092 --> 01:01:52,686
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

557
01:01:54,063 --> 01:01:56,930
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

558
01:01:57,132 --> 01:01:58,861
Dex had a hand in designing it.

559
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:02,329
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

560
01:02:02,538 --> 01:02:03,596
Yeah.

561
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:06,331
I can keep a secret.

562
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:14,382
Two shots.

563
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:18,952
<i>Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.</i>

564
01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:21,149
Copy, 327.

565
01:02:21,357 --> 01:02:23,587
<i>Welcome aboard, captain.</i>

566
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:06,997
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

567
01:03:09,772 --> 01:03:11,535
It's good to see you too, Franky.

568
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:16,006
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

569
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:17,337
It's important.

570
01:03:21,283 --> 01:03:22,511
What is that?

571
01:03:28,123 --> 01:03:29,886
You be nice.

572
01:03:31,126 --> 01:03:33,856
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

573
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:37,561
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

574
01:03:37,766 --> 01:03:39,859
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

575
01:03:40,803 --> 01:03:44,204
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

576
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:50,909
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

577
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:53,047
or at least you were last time...

578
01:03:53,248 --> 01:03:55,648
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

579
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:57,842
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

580
01:03:58,053 --> 01:04:01,511
<i>- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.</i>

581
01:04:01,724 --> 01:04:03,089
<i>- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.</i>

582
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:15,266
Take us to 10,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

583
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:16,438
Yes, commander.

584
01:04:17,306 --> 01:04:19,103
Reconnaissance located an island

585
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:22,072
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

586
01:04:22,277 --> 01:04:24,745
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

587
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:26,915
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

588
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:31,308
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

589
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,454
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

590
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:38,255
Polly, try not to touch anything.

591
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,590
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

592
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:46,029
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

593
01:04:57,046 --> 01:04:59,537
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

594
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:08,579
Totenkopf.

595
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,552
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

596
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:17,926
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

597
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,500
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

598
01:05:20,703 --> 01:05:23,797
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

599
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:26,031
He's got Dex.

600
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:30,001
Rescind order!

601
01:05:32,014 --> 01:05:35,506
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

602
01:05:40,222 --> 01:05:42,656
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

603
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:46,089
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

604
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:47,992
But...

605
01:05:49,164 --> 01:05:50,688
...this area here,

606
01:05:50,899 --> 01:05:52,662
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

607
01:05:52,868 --> 01:05:57,305
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

608
01:05:57,573 --> 01:05:59,768
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

609
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:02,341
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

610
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:03,977
Leave that to me.

611
01:06:06,381 --> 01:06:08,178
Alert the amphibious squadron.

612
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:15,088
<i>Report to main station carrier.</i>

613
01:06:52,828 --> 01:06:54,090
What?

614
01:06:54,296 --> 01:06:55,490
Nanjing?

615
01:06:56,665 --> 01:06:58,963
I can't hear you, Polly.

616
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:00,698
You'll have to speak up.

617
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:25,485
<i>Keep your nose up, Joseph. You
always were bad at the short takeoff.</i>

618
01:07:25,694 --> 01:07:28,424
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

619
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:34,302
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

620
01:07:34,736 --> 01:07:35,896
Thank you, Polly.

621
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,036
So you heard that, did you?

622
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:45,408
<i>Manta leader to Manta team,
impact in ten seconds.</i>

623
01:07:45,614 --> 01:07:47,309
Switching to amphibious mode.

624
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:59,661
Impact in five, four, three,

625
01:07:59,862 --> 01:08:01,989
two, one.

626
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,382
Franky.

627
01:08:29,591 --> 01:08:32,651
<i>You remember our milk run
over Shanghai, don't you?</i>

628
01:08:32,861 --> 01:08:35,329
<i>We had the target buttoned up
and he was jinxing in the flak.</i>

629
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,829
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

630
01:08:39,034 --> 01:08:40,433
<i>- "Protect the rabbits!
- "Protect the rabbits!</i>

631
01:08:40,636 --> 01:08:43,161
<i>- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"</i>

632
01:08:53,815 --> 01:08:58,775
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

633
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,434
Joe, watch out!

634
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:58,375
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

635
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:05,114
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

636
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,385
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

637
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:15,424
Manta leader to Manta team,

638
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,895
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

639
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:22,503
Fire.

640
01:10:36,718 --> 01:10:38,913
Joseph! Pull up!

641
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:53,657
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

642
01:10:56,104 --> 01:10:58,004
Do you hear me? Disengage.

643
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:00,235
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

644
01:11:00,442 --> 01:11:03,240
<i>- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!</i>

645
01:11:03,445 --> 01:11:06,175
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

646
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:10,579
Disengage!

647
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:30,133
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

648
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:31,703
<i>You're only going to have
one shot at this.</i>

649
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:33,966
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

650
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:36,110
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

651
01:11:36,578 --> 01:11:38,136
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

652
01:11:38,346 --> 01:11:40,211
Franky, pull up.

653
01:11:41,883 --> 01:11:43,680
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

654
01:11:43,885 --> 01:11:45,375
Two.

655
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,882
One.

656
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:02,869
You're all clear.

657
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:05,337
<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

658
01:12:05,674 --> 01:12:08,336
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

659
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:10,875
She's some kind of girl.

660
01:12:12,114 --> 01:12:13,206
Yes, I know.

661
01:12:34,803 --> 01:12:36,737
I'm taking us up.

662
01:13:30,959 --> 01:13:32,290
What?

663
01:13:37,566 --> 01:13:41,764
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

664
01:13:56,918 --> 01:14:00,945
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

665
01:14:01,156 --> 01:14:03,317
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

666
01:14:03,525 --> 01:14:05,516
Suit yourself.

667
01:14:08,063 --> 01:14:11,396
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

668
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:35,786
Run.

669
01:14:47,269 --> 01:14:48,566
There.

670
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,719
Polly!

671
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:14,922
Oh, great.

672
01:15:16,564 --> 01:15:18,054
Come on!

673
01:15:20,235 --> 01:15:21,202
Polly!

674
01:15:23,204 --> 01:15:24,694
Come on!

675
01:15:34,649 --> 01:15:35,550
Are you mad?

676
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,380
Are you mad?

677
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:40,748
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

678
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:48,127
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

679
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:50,628
- I didn't mean...
- I shot the ground!

680
01:15:53,168 --> 01:15:54,692
- What?
- When we were running,

681
01:15:54,903 --> 01:15:57,804
I shot the ground.

682
01:16:02,377 --> 01:16:04,277
It isn't funny.

683
01:16:06,314 --> 01:16:11,411
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

684
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:21,160
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

685
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:23,253
You gave it to me.

686
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:27,961
You don't even remember, do you?

687
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:31,862
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

688
01:16:32,073 --> 01:16:34,633
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

689
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:36,973
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

690
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:38,577
and I want you to tell me the truth.

691
01:16:38,813 --> 01:16:42,647
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

692
01:16:43,284 --> 01:16:44,945
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

693
01:16:45,153 --> 01:16:48,179
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

694
01:16:49,891 --> 01:16:50,949
Look me in the eyes.

695
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:54,961
I never fooled around on you.

696
01:16:55,163 --> 01:16:56,130
Never.

697
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:00,967
I sabotaged your plane.

698
01:17:02,971 --> 01:17:04,495
- Three months.
- I knew it!

699
01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:07,539
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy...

700
01:17:12,213 --> 01:17:13,908
He's here.

701
01:17:24,759 --> 01:17:26,454
You all right?

702
01:17:42,343 --> 01:17:43,708
Through there.

703
01:17:50,452 --> 01:17:51,419
Through there.

704
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,379
My God, Joe.

705
01:18:54,716 --> 01:18:56,377
It's an ark.

706
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:58,916
He's building an ark.

707
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,725
What are you doing?

708
01:19:12,734 --> 01:19:15,396
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

709
01:19:15,603 --> 01:19:18,731
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

710
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,272
inside a giant rocket ship?

711
01:19:21,876 --> 01:19:23,503
I might.

712
01:19:25,013 --> 01:19:27,538
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

713
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:39,321
<i>- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.</i>

714
01:19:39,527 --> 01:19:41,927
We have to find Totenkopf.

715
01:19:51,639 --> 01:19:53,300
You've got a gift.

716
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,460
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

717
01:20:25,373 --> 01:20:26,533
<i>Einsteigen. Komm, springt!</i>

718
01:20:34,082 --> 01:20:35,640
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

719
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,909
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

720
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:40,747
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

721
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:44,888
The machines that were guarding us

722
01:20:45,093 --> 01:20:47,061
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

723
01:20:47,261 --> 01:20:49,559
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

724
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,600
Dex! Get us out of here!

725
01:21:17,925 --> 01:21:19,290
Good boy, Dex.

726
01:21:20,194 --> 01:21:21,456
Thanks, Cap.

727
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,797
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.

728
01:21:28,002 --> 01:21:29,094
Or what's left of them.

729
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:32,329
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

730
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,802
Finish what?

731
01:21:34,175 --> 01:21:35,142
Tell them.

732
01:21:35,343 --> 01:21:38,403
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

733
01:21:38,613 --> 01:21:40,240
so he proposed the unthinkable:

734
01:21:40,448 --> 01:21:43,884
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

735
01:21:44,085 --> 01:21:45,052
into space.

736
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:47,244
He used his machines
to collect specimens

737
01:21:47,455 --> 01:21:49,116
representing all life on Earth.

738
01:21:49,323 --> 01:21:50,915
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

739
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:53,923
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

740
01:21:54,128 --> 01:21:56,426
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

741
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:58,895
Seeds of a technological utopia.

742
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,499
We smuggled them off this island,

743
01:22:00,702 --> 01:22:02,499
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

744
01:22:02,704 --> 01:22:06,265
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

745
01:22:06,474 --> 01:22:09,170
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

746
01:22:09,377 --> 01:22:12,005
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

747
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:14,113
Why? What haven't you told us?

748
01:22:14,315 --> 01:22:17,512
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

749
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:20,483
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

750
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:23,452
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

751
01:22:23,658 --> 01:22:25,751
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

752
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:28,520
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

753
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:29,990
Good boy, Dex.

754
01:22:34,135 --> 01:22:36,296
Careful. Careful.

755
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,374
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

756
01:22:47,081 --> 01:22:48,446
Through there.
That's the only way in.

757
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:51,948
You see, there is no way past them.

758
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,388
Five minutes, Joe.

759
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,421
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

760
01:22:58,493 --> 01:23:00,051
He knows what he's doing.

761
01:23:02,697 --> 01:23:03,789
I think.

762
01:23:08,703 --> 01:23:09,670
Hey, that's my gun!

763
01:23:15,243 --> 01:23:16,437
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

764
01:23:24,485 --> 01:23:27,852
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

765
01:23:28,055 --> 01:23:29,352
Doctor, stop!

766
01:23:46,741 --> 01:23:49,266
<i>Who dares come before me?</i>

767
01:23:49,477 --> 01:23:51,741
<i>Who dares enter this place?</i>

768
01:23:51,946 --> 01:23:55,177
<i>What has begun
cannot be stopped.</i>

769
01:23:55,383 --> 01:23:58,716
<i>- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.</i>

770
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,182
Hello, doctor.

771
01:24:00,388 --> 01:24:01,855
Why are you doing this?

772
01:24:02,056 --> 01:24:05,025
<i>I have been witness to a world
consumed by hatred</i>

773
01:24:05,226 --> 01:24:07,524
<i>and bent on self-destruction.</i>

774
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:11,027
<i>Watched as we have taken
what was to be a paradise</i>

775
01:24:11,232 --> 01:24:14,531
<i>and failed in our responsibilities
as its steward.</i>

776
01:24:14,735 --> 01:24:17,966
<i>I know now that the course
the human race has set for itself</i>

777
01:24:18,272 --> 01:24:20,206
<i>cannot be changed.</i>

778
01:24:20,408 --> 01:24:24,640
<i>I am the last, desperate chance
for a doomed planet.</i>

779
01:24:24,846 --> 01:24:27,542
<i>Now, leave this place or die!</i>

780
01:24:34,288 --> 01:24:36,620
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

781
01:24:48,202 --> 01:24:49,635
I meant throw something.

782
01:25:11,826 --> 01:25:13,088
He's not here.

783
01:25:13,561 --> 01:25:15,028
We're too late.

784
01:25:15,229 --> 01:25:16,924
These are his personal papers.

785
01:25:17,131 --> 01:25:20,623
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

786
01:25:20,835 --> 01:25:23,497
- We must find him.
- I found him.

787
01:25:38,552 --> 01:25:39,712
It's impossible.

788
01:25:40,955 --> 01:25:42,217
It can't be.

789
01:25:42,423 --> 01:25:45,790
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 11, 1918.

790
01:25:46,027 --> 01:25:47,654
He died over 20 years ago.

791
01:25:54,535 --> 01:25:56,332
We've been chasing a ghost.

792
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:11,484
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

793
01:26:17,558 --> 01:26:20,026
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

794
01:26:20,227 --> 01:26:25,597
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

795
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,769
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

796
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,962
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

797
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:35,770
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

798
01:26:35,977 --> 01:26:38,343
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

799
01:26:38,546 --> 01:26:40,878
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

800
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:46,411
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

801
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,918
it should create a short...

802
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:53,719
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

803
01:26:53,928 --> 01:26:55,691
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

804
01:26:57,231 --> 01:27:00,598
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

805
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:03,133
You won't have time to escape.

806
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,701
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

807
01:27:08,909 --> 01:27:11,673
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

808
01:27:11,879 --> 01:27:14,404
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

809
01:27:14,615 --> 01:27:16,606
We had a deal.

810
01:27:17,284 --> 01:27:20,310
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

811
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:27,021
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

812
01:27:27,228 --> 01:27:30,391
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

813
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,808
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

814
01:27:49,383 --> 01:27:51,783
<i>One minute to liftoff.</i>

815
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:08,260
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

816
01:28:11,572 --> 01:28:12,596
How do you wanna do this?

817
01:29:20,441 --> 01:29:22,671
Nice shot, Polly.

818
01:29:33,053 --> 01:29:35,214
What took you so long?

819
01:29:39,593 --> 01:29:40,753
She's a machine.

820
01:29:47,968 --> 01:29:50,596
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff.</i>

821
01:29:51,105 --> 01:29:52,402
<i>Nine...</i>

822
01:29:52,606 --> 01:29:53,903
<i>... eight...</i>

823
01:29:54,108 --> 01:29:55,632
<i>... seven...</i>

824
01:29:55,843 --> 01:29:57,105
<i>... six...</i>

825
01:29:57,311 --> 01:29:58,642
<i>... five...</i>

826
01:29:58,846 --> 01:30:00,404
<i>... four...</i>

827
01:30:49,697 --> 01:30:51,460
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

828
01:30:51,665 --> 01:30:53,860
<i>Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

829
01:30:54,068 --> 01:30:55,330
There's no time.

830
01:30:59,773 --> 01:31:01,297
That's our only way across.

831
01:31:06,113 --> 01:31:08,581
<i>Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

832
01:31:17,758 --> 01:31:21,319
<i>Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!</i>

833
01:31:21,795 --> 01:31:23,490
What did you do now?

834
01:31:27,768 --> 01:31:28,735
Come on!

835
01:31:28,936 --> 01:31:31,564
<i>Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

836
01:31:44,485 --> 01:31:46,385
<i>Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

837
01:31:49,623 --> 01:31:51,215
Hold on!

838
01:31:57,965 --> 01:32:01,696
Please! Don't touch anything else!

839
01:32:09,877 --> 01:32:12,368
There's no time. We'll never make it.

840
01:32:13,514 --> 01:32:16,278
<i>Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

841
01:32:24,024 --> 01:32:25,048
Run!

842
01:32:26,527 --> 01:32:28,927
<i>Forty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

843
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,968
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

844
01:32:41,508 --> 01:32:44,375
<i>Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

845
01:32:48,515 --> 01:32:50,710
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

846
01:32:59,993 --> 01:33:00,960
It didn't work.

847
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,499
<i>Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

848
01:33:07,101 --> 01:33:10,366
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

849
01:33:11,905 --> 01:33:15,841
<i>And God saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth...</i>

850
01:33:16,043 --> 01:33:18,978
<i>- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...</i>

851
01:33:19,179 --> 01:33:20,476
Shut up!

852
01:33:20,681 --> 01:33:23,275
<i>Ten kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

853
01:33:23,784 --> 01:33:24,751
<i>Nine...</i>

854
01:33:25,753 --> 01:33:27,118
<i>... eight...</i>

855
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:28,413
<i>... seven...</i>

856
01:33:28,922 --> 01:33:31,482
<i>- ... six...
- Why won't you die?</i>

857
01:33:31,692 --> 01:33:33,819
<i>Five kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

858
01:33:35,295 --> 01:33:36,990
<i>Four...</i>

859
01:33:37,564 --> 01:33:38,758
<i>... three...</i>

860
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,267
<i>... two...</i>

861
01:33:42,469 --> 01:33:43,697
<i>... one.</i>

862
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:50,473
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

863
01:33:50,878 --> 01:33:52,505
<i>Booster malfunction.</i>

864
01:33:52,713 --> 01:33:54,772
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

865
01:33:54,982 --> 01:33:56,142
<i>Danger.</i>

866
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,875
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

867
01:33:59,086 --> 01:34:00,314
<i>- Booster malfunction.
- Look!</i>

868
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:01,986
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

869
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:04,953
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.

870
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:24,643
I see them, commander.

871
01:34:25,145 --> 01:34:29,104
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.

872
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:23,032
One shot.

873
01:35:26,139 --> 01:35:27,868
You got your story.

874
01:35:45,626 --> 01:35:47,150
Polly.

875
01:35:48,662 --> 01:35:49,629
- You...
- It's all right.

876
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:52,094
You don't have to say anything.

877
01:35:54,835 --> 01:35:56,598
Lens cap.
