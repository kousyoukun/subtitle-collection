1
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,753
Attention. Please prepare
for docking procedure.

2
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,493
There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.

3
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,502
They didn't leave a name.

4
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,608
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

5
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,308
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

6
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,211
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

7
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,447
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

8
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,296
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

9
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,124
You don't like my smile?

10
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,698
I don't like what's behind it.

11
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,763
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

12
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,841
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

13
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,213
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

14
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,147
I'll bring you some popcorn.

15
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,081
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

16
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,921
We must be over the rainbow.

17
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,025
You sent me this?

18
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,766
Who are you?

19
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,941
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

20
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,045
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

21
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,545
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

22
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,843
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which--

23
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,646
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

24
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,124
Yes, l--

25
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,454
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

26
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,988
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

27
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,261
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

28
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,999
It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 1 1."

29
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,576
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

30
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,839
The things we were made
to do there...

31
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,141
Terrible things.

32
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,546
- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.

33
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,250
Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?

34
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,326
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

35
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,225
Yes.

36
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,158
Don't you see?

37
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,163
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

38
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,971
Me.

39
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,873
He's coming for me.

40
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,838
Who? Who's coming?

41
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,342
Totenkopf.

42
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,744
It's Totenkopf.

43
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,570
There!

44
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,242
All citizens, attention.

45
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,354
New York City
must be evacuated at once.

46
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,890
Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.

47
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,859
All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty

48
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,591
shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.

49
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,200
This is urgent.

50
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,604
- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.

51
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,007
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

52
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,943
Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.

53
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,950
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

54
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,451
and someone named Totenkopf.

55
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,590
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

56
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,657
Totenkopf. Who is he?

57
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,623
He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.

58
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,490
Quick as you can.

59
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,825
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

60
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,126
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

61
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,633
and get the hell out of there.

62
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,464
Wait a minute.

63
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,576
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

64
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,510
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

65
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,842
Fifth Avenue.

66
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,382
They're a hundred--
They're a hundred yards away.

67
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,747
Polly. Polly!

68
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,484
Oh, my God.

69
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,988
Polly!

70
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,160
Polly!

71
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,161
Polly!

72
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,457
Stop! Come back!

73
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,469
Fire!

74
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,672
Get out of here!

75
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,613
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

76
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:27,808
Send everything you've got!

77
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,682
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

78
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,384
Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.

79
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,827
This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.

80
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,523
Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?

81
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,295
Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.

82
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,132
This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.

83
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,673
Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?

84
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,939
Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.

85
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,584
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

86
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,326
Polly.

87
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,131
Joe.

88
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,341
Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.

89
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,741
The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication

90
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,544
due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.

91
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,653
Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies

92
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,086
now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.

93
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,489
The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg

94
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,061
was virtually excavated

95
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,893
by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.

96
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,231
News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines

97
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,667
rising from the ground,

98
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,707
robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.

99
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,009
Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,

100
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,206
world leaders
must once again call upon

101
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,319
the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire

102
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,958
to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.

103
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,742
Where's Dex?

104
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,252
Shazam.

105
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,206
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

106
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,546
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

107
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,851
Oh, I need to show you something.

108
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

109
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,558
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

110
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,896
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

111
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,827
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

112
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,524
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

113
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,795
I think it's being used
to control them.

114
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,666
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

115
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,473
I can try, yeah.

116
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,972
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

117
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,704
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

118
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,246
Find out what makes it tick.

119
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,218
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

120
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,518
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

121
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:29,398
Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.

122
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,387
Tummy ache?

123
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,830
How you been, Joe?

124
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,000
- Miss me?
- Get out.

125
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,566
Well, it's nice to see you too.

126
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,236
Dex said you might be in a mood.

127
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,809
Dex?

128
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,377
Get in here!

129
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,712
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

130
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,750
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

131
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,547
You sabotaged my plane.

132
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,554
Right.

133
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,196
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

134
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,130
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

135
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,002
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

136
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,367
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

137
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,132
in his bathrobe, remember?

138
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,708
You know, I'm starting to think

139
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,879
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

140
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,207
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

141
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,975
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

142
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,380
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

143
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,578
Who was she, Joe?

144
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,347
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

145
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,049
What are you gonna do?

146
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,926
Shoot me?

147
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,499
Oh, great. We all made up.

148
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,936
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

149
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:16,164
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

150
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,206
If she resists, shoot her.

151
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,741
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

152
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,038
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

153
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,714
Okay.

154
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:28,352
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

155
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,923
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

156
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,955
Lots more.

157
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:42,266
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

158
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,765
And you're gonna help me get it.

159
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,802
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

160
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,834
Show me what?

161
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,481
Show me what?

162
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,024
My God. What is this?

163
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,960
Where do they come from?

164
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,533
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

165
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,401
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

166
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,267
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

167
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,844
and then they disappear
without a trace.

168
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,205
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

169
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,849
or who's sending them here.

170
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,679
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

171
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,084
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

172
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,556
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

173
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,251
Totenkopf.

174
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,328
He nearly went white
when he said it.

175
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,795
Totenkopf, who is he?

176
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,366
He's the invisible man.

177
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,131
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

178
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,605
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

179
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,505
This is the only thing I could dig up.

180
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,879
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

181
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,847
before the start of World War l.

182
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,214
Something called Unit 1 1.

183
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,550
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

184
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,824
Until today.

185
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,996
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

186
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,461
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

187
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,731
The scientist, where is he now?

188
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,536
We're in this together, right, Joe?

189
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,873
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

190
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,711
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

191
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,250
Understood.

192
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,060
What?

193
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,662
I missed you.

194
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,101
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

195
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,845
Were you down there?

196
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,812
You missed me too. How nice.

197
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,354
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

198
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,063
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

199
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,837
Dr. Jennings!

200
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,771
It's locked.

201
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,608
That window there.

202
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,886
I may be able to get in
through that window

203
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,079
if I can attach a line...

204
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,786
It's open.

205
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,475
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

206
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,458
All right, Polly...

207
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,391
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

208
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,224
I was hoping you could tell me.

209
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,835
Dr. Jennings!

210
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,973
You must stop him!

211
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,972
Stay here.

212
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,715
Stop!

213
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,319
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,987
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

215
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,654
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

216
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,595
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

217
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,364
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

218
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,563
Promise.

219
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:40,982
He's dead.

220
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,188
I think I found something.

221
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,964
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

222
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,466
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

223
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,111
Of course you are.

224
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,391
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

225
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:21,792
and coming straight for us.

226
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,992
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

227
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,035
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

228
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,369
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

229
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,309
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

230
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,415
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

231
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,847
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

232
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,385
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

233
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,556
Go, go, go!

234
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,294
Get in.

235
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,674
There you are.

236
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,588
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

237
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,021
Come in, Dex.

238
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,502
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

239
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,373
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

240
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,341
- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,

241
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,841
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

242
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,205
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

243
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,906
Which machine is it, Dex?

244
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,081
There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.

245
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,116
I think I found it, Dex.

246
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,797
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

247
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,495
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

248
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,140
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

249
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,544
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

250
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,041
I'll let you know. Out.

251
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,088
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

252
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,724
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

253
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,432
They've come back
for the generators.

254
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,601
Who is this guy?

255
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,649
- You okay?
- Great.

256
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,447
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

257
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,954
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

258
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,250
Pull up!

259
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,101
- Joe!
- I see it!

260
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,215
It's getting away.

261
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,478
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

262
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,122
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

263
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:14,628
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

264
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,266
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

265
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,267
Hey!

266
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,875
Okay, okay, now go straight.

267
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,144
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

268
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,486
Back there.

269
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,432
I could use a little more warning
next time.

270
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,601
Go left!

271
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,775
Tell me you got something, Dex.

272
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,807
We're getting clobbered up here.

273
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,505
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

274
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,051
Joe!

275
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,696
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

276
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,598
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

277
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,864
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

278
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,572
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

279
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,840
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

280
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,247
Will you just trust me? Go left!

281
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,161
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

282
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,329
It's a dead end!

283
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:56,922
There's no way out!

284
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,636
Oh, bugger.

285
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,406
Joe!

286
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,027
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

287
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:35,900
I got us here, didn't l?

288
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,276
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

289
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,245
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

290
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,410
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

291
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,390
Still glad you came?

292
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,774
Joe, I found it! Joe!

293
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,272
Dex, come in. Where is it?

294
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,815
Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?

295
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,489
Dex, do you read me?

296
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,363
Dex, are you there?

297
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,632
I can't outrun them much longer.

298
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:17,900
Hold on.

299
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,378
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

300
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,015
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

301
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,084
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

302
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,853
Joe, you have to pull up!

303
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,028
Pull up!

304
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,878
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

305
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,850
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

306
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,990
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

307
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,863
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

308
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,801
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

309
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,374
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

310
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,411
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

311
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,080
Oh, I can take it.

312
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,182
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

313
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,616
Because that was nothing.

314
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,742
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

315
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,943
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

316
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,226
Dex!

317
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,833
Dex!

318
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,168
Dex.

319
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,496
They're everywhere.

320
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,368
Joe, look out!

321
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,844
Dex!

322
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,598
Why would Totenkopf do this?

323
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,126
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

324
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,502
He was looking for something.

325
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,445
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

326
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,420
He must have got too close.

327
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,942
- He was trying to tell me something--
- Joe.

328
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,554
Good boy, Dex.

329
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,575
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

330
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,648
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

331
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,382
- My God.
- What?

332
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,023
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 1 2 years old.

333
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,691
By 1 7, he had already received
two doctorates

334
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,160
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

335
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,324
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

336
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,595
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

337
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,103
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

338
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,606
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

339
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,439
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

340
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,139
Even less is known
about his companion,

341
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,580
an assassin who controls
his machines."

342
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,276
She's the one who took Dex.

343
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:39,923
What else?

344
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,193
These are Unit 1 1 supply logs.

345
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,332
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

346
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,969
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

347
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,196
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

348
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,535
What have you been up to, doctor?

349
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,885
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

350
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,829
We'll find him.

351
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,265
My old friend Joe.

352
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,173
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

353
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,505
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

354
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,338
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

355
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,207
Nice to meet you.

356
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,621
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

357
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,756
Did you get a little something
for me?

358
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:25,156
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

359
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:30,129
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

360
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,461
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

361
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,372
Come, I'll show you the maps.

362
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,650
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

363
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,652
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

364
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,487
I don't trust him.

365
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,422
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

366
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:02,756
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

367
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,799
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

368
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,880
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

369
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,583
This is where
the transmission originated.

370
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,219
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

371
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,353
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

372
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,189
It is forbidden.

373
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,091
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

374
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,858
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

375
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,831
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

376
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,231
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

377
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,034
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

378
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,906
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

379
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,548
Why? Why is this place so special?

380
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,516
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

381
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,553
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

382
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,954
You may know it as Shangri-la.

383
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,760
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

384
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,634
I need to send a message.

385
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,741
Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.

386
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,850
We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.

387
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,816
The story grows stranger
at every turn.

388
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:35,287
Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.

389
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:36,925
I fear time is running out.

390
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,692
With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.

391
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,265
I hope. Polly Perkins.

392
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,257
This is where civilization stops.

393
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,364
A blank on the map.

394
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,167
We must be careful from here.

395
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,504
Hurry.

396
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,432
What is it?

397
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,035
It looks like a mining outpost.

398
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,832
Something bad happened here.

399
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,879
Seems to be abandoned.

400
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,241
Tell your men we're heading down.

401
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,274
I want a closer look.

402
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,193
What is it, Joe?

403
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,591
Uranium.

404
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,494
The whole mine's contaminated.

405
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,468
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

406
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,005
Where's Polly?

407
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,438
Polly!

408
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,704
Miss Perkins?

409
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,346
We'll have to split up.

410
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,830
Polly!

411
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,898
Let her go.

412
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,929
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

413
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,698
What vials?
What are you talking about?

414
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,475
I will not ask a second time.

415
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,941
Drop the gun.

416
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,848
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

417
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,357
As you wish.

418
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,363
Wait! Wait. Wait.

419
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,472
I'm sorry, Joe.

420
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,804
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

421
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,991
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

422
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,756
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

423
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:38,264
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

424
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,868
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

425
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,801
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

426
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,838
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

427
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,406
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

428
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:55,608
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

429
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,388
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

430
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,080
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,721
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

432
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,495
Do you hear that?

433
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,171
Dynamite.

434
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,711
That noise again.

435
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,885
Move!

436
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,672
What are you doing?

437
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,481
Come on!

438
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,748
Oh, great.

439
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,649
We're safe.

440
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,957
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

441
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,093
There's something
I need to ask you.

442
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,488
Yes, Joe?

443
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,457
Did you cut my fuel line?

444
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,036
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

445
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,299
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

446
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,670
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

447
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,684
There you are.

448
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,361
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

449
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:47,730
My film.

450
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,194
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

451
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,414
Polly.

452
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,048
Polly.
