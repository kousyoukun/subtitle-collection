00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,583
[in Tswana] These are our lives!

174
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,166
[in English] You need to start giving me
what I've been giving you,

175
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,583
which is respect and commitment.

176
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,666
[in Zulu]
What's going on here? What's wrong?

177
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,125
Baby, please.
Just give me a chance. Look, I promise--

178
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,666
[in Tswana] I gave you a chance!
Six years we've been together! Six!

179
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,041
[in English] And this is how you repay me?

180
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,583
Sandile, I can't do this anymore.

181
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,750
I can't.

182
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

183
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,500
[in Zulu] Go after her!

184
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,833
So you're leaving?

185
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,916
Okay, you know what?

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,083
If that's how you feel,
if you don't even trust me, then go! Go!

187
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:26,750
Oh, Lord. Not this again. Oh, God.

188
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,583
Ma. Oh, goodness. Ma.

189
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,041
-Ma!
-Ma!

190
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,250
Ma.

191
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,541
Hey. Wake up!

192
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,666
Where am I?

193
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,083
-You're home, Ma.
-Can you please hold this for me?

194
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,708
Menzi, please bring me Jonas from my bag.

195
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,291
Here's Jonas.

196
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:51,791
I have three sons. Three sons.

197
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,125
Not one of them is married.

198
00:10:55,208 --> 00:11:00,666
Why, Jonas, why?

199
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,125
[in English]
Her blood pressure is just elevated.

200
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,916
She'll just need to
take it easy for a while.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,291
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

202
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,583
Do you guys think
that guy is good-looking?

203
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,583
[in Zulu] Oh, Lord. Oh, Father in heaven!

204
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:25,583
Send Jonas down
to fetch me so I can be close to you.

205
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:30,375
This is an empty house
with no family and no grandchildren.

206
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,583
No!

207
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,708
[in English] Okay. Wait, Ma.

208
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,375
But you're not alone.

209
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,416
Yes, Ma. Sky and I,
we actually live here with you.

210
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,291
Yeah, that's a real consolation.

211
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,750
-Okay.
-[in Zulu] What are you doing here, huh?

212
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,666
You should be on your knees apologizing,

213
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,416
begging that beautiful girl
for forgiveness.

214
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
-You're a disgrace!
-Ma, I promise--

215
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,291
-Hey!
-I promise I didn't do anything.

216
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,000
-[in English] And then?
-Ma?

217
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,875
[in Zulu] You're busy laughing?

218
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,458
When are you getting married?

219
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,458
Getting a wife and children?

220
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,583
Ma, let's be honest,
what woman's gonna marry him?

221
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,625
-He irons his socks and underwear.
-Yeah. Or the bed.

222
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,583
[in English]
Okay, I actually happen to have standards.

223
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,666
[in Zulu] And you, my child.

224
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,666
It doesn't matter.

225
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,375
It's not a problem, it doesn't bother me.

226
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,958
As your mother, I understand.

227
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,708
-We all understand.
-We understand. It's okay.

228
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,541
[in English] Ma, I'm not gay.

229
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,291
It's okay. It's okay to be gay.

230
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,708
I know that, but I'm not gay.

231
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,875
Stop it. Enough.

232
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,166
[in Zulu]
I received a nice offer to sell the house

233
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,166
and I'm taking it.

234
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,166
-No, Ma. You can't do that!
-Wait. No.

235
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,166
I'm taking it, end of story!

236
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,375
Your blood pressure.
You don't want to do that.

237
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,833
[in English] Ma, you really can't do that.

238
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,125
Why?

239
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:58,125
[in English]
Homes like mine are meant for families.

240
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,333
For a husband, a wife and children.

241
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:08,791
I was hoping one of you
would go down the right path, but no.

242
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,541
I was delusional. I was dreaming!

243
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,500
So I've decided I'm selling it.

244
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,708
End of story.

245
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:20,166
[in English]
Okay. But, Mommy, my studio is here.

246
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,708
Mom, just a little sidebar here, um,

247
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:27,541
I put the house as collateral to finance
the expansion of the restaurant.

248
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,458
[in Zulu] So if you sell the house then--

249
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,875
Menzi, no one cares about your tuck shop.

250
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,416
Ma, can I be serious for a second?

251
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,125
-Excuse me?
-Okay, so what happened is that,

252
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,916
at the penthouse I stay at,
they're kicking me out.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,250
-So if you--
-Not my problem.

254
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,875
I've done my job as a mother.

255
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,625
[in English] Mom, so, here's the thing.

256
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,375
-Ma, what if I get married?
-[scoffs]

257
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,250
Will you give me the house then?

258
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,083
[in Zulu] Menzi, who's gonna marry you?

259
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,291
-You're afraid of women.
-Enough!

260
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,625
-Okay, you--
-I've waited long enough.

261
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,708
[in English] It's too much.

262
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,833
Ma, please.

263
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:06,458
Maybe if I just get married at the end
of the year. If you just give me that.

264
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,541
Me too. If I get married at the end
of the year, maybe you can help me out.

265
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,208
Wait. What about me, Ma?
I can get married too.

266
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,041
-Okay. You--
-I don't give.

267
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,000
[in Zulu] Listen here.

268
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,083
Here's the deal.

269
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:24,000
Whoever is married by the end of the year

270
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,791
can have the house as a wedding present.

271
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,166
Otherwise, I sell it.

272
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,291
I'm selling it.

273
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,791
Really, Mom?

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,375
[in Zulu]
Damn, I really need to get married.

275
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,041
[in Tswana] Would your mom be okay
with a gay marriage?

276
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,625
[in English] No. I'm not gay.

277
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,833
Okay.

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,333
I've got a girlfriend.

279
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,708
[in Tswana] This famous girlfriend.
So why have I never met her?

280
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,666
[in English] Because it's-- It's a secret.

281
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,166
Okay. Well, why don't you marry
this secret girlfriend of yours

282
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,083
and turn this house
into a dressmaking factory?

283
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,708
We could build an empire.

284
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:17,208
All you need to do is turn this imaginary
girlfriend into your imaginary wife. See?

285
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,750
You know?

286
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,958
[knocking on door]

287
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,916
Hey. Sandman.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,250
Ah…

289
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,333
[in Zulu] Sandile Ngubeni. Top dog.

290
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,958
[in English]
Song of the year, "Mina Nawe". Main man!

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,333
[in Zulu] And who are you?

292
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,041
Sorry, my brother.

293
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,833
I'm Lunga. Big fan.

294
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,791
My brother, your song, "Mina Nawe",
is still my ringtone.

295
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:53,250
If my phone would ring,
we'd be dancing, you and I. [laughs]

296
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,375
[in English] Yeah. Sure.

297
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,416
[in Zulu] Oh, I'm here to take the car.

298
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,208
-What?
-The car.

299
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,583
[in English] Right.

300
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,250
[in Zulu] No. Get out of here.

301
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,750
No way.

302
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,666
Dude. Is this all yours?

303
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,458
You have a coffee machine!

304
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,208
And a black kettle!

305
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,541
[stammering] Yeah.

306
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,666
-Whose car?
-Your car.

307
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,083
Bra Zakes wants his money,
he's a loan shark.

308
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,875
You work for Bra Zakes?

309
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,833
Maybe this is him calling.

310
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,416
What did I tell you?

311
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,416
Hey, Bra Zakes. Sure, sure.

312
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,750
Yeah, I found him.

313
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,833
No. He understands
that we need to take the car.

314
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,875
No.
I don't understand. Let me talk to him.

315
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,458
-Bra Zakes, listen.
-No, man.

316
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,208
I am working on a track.
I promise I'll pay you.

317
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,041
-Bra Zakes.
-No. Hey.

318
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,208
Bra Zakes doesn't talk to artists. Relax.

319
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,291
Bra Zakes. Sure, sure.
Okay, I will fix this, boss.

320
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,375
Good.

321
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,166
-What are you doing?
-Look, Lungile, my brother--

322
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,250
Lunga. @that_guy_lungsta
on Twitter and Instagram.

323
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,708
-Will you follow me? Follow me.
-Yeah.

324
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,500
-All right. Sure, sure.
-Yeah.

325
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,625
Lungsta, please, give me some time.

326
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,166
-I'll make a plan.
-No.

327
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,291
You're killing me.

328
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,833
You're killing me, my man.
Bra Zakes wants his money.

329
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,916
Okay. Listen.

330
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,541
The car? I won't take it.

331
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,291
You're a good guy, I like you.
I'm not taking the car. [laughs]

332
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,833
But the sofa, I'm taking it.

333
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,000
You're always sitting. Uh-uh.

334
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,750
Get up and get things done.
Write something.

335
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,750
Write a song, like,
"Till death do us part."

336
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,500
"We die together."
"We die here, we die there."

337
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,333
You get me? Creativity.
Stop sitting on the sofa.

338
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,125
[in English] Gents. Right.

339
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,666
[in Zulu] We're taking the sofa!

340
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,750
[laughs] Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Get up and do something.

341
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,166
Listen,
once you've made a hit song, call me.

342
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,958
Say, "Lungsta, I have a hit--"

343
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,083
I know a lot of radio people.
I'll put in a good word for you.

344
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,375
Who knows? Maybe we'll end up touring.

345
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,375
You and I.

346
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,916
See what I did there? You and I.

347
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,291
Sandman.

348
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,208
Let's go, gents!

349
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,166
[in English]
I hear you're looking for a chef.

350
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,416
Um. Excuse me, how did you get in here?

351
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,875
So are you looking?

352
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,250
Are you even a chef?
Let's start there, huh?

353
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,541
Well, then, Miss Chef.

354
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,166
As you know, since you have been a chef
somewhere before,

355
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,583
that there are procedures.

356
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,041
You apply, then there's an interview.

357
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,125
You know, this place
kinda has some really high standards.

358
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,375
So, thank you.

359
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,041
Actually,

360
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,958
I don't think it's gonna work out.

361
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,458
What's cooking?

362
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,333
Um. Excuse me.

363
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,458
-What are you doing?
-Just needs a--

364
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,583
It needs a what?

365
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,416
Okay, ma'am? Um.

366
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,208
Hello? You're gonna need to
stop what you're doing. Okay?

367
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,791
Okay, stop. Okay.

368
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,166
You need to stop what you're doing.
You are ruining that recipe.

369
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,500
Please, you're gonna need to
get out of my restaurant right this--

370
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,250
So, am I hired?

371
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,208
We'll see.

372
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,291
But I'm gonna need to see your references.

373
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,666
What's this?

374
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,375
[in Zulu]
These are Daddy saying he's sorry,

375
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,583
and please forgive him.

376
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,083
[in English] With roses?

377
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,500
[in Zulu] They're beautiful, hey?

378
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,250
[in English]
But not as beautiful as you are, baby.

379
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,708
[in English]
Stay away from me with those things.

380
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,375
We've been together for so long
and you forgot that I'm allergic to roses?

381
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,625
You're an idiot!

382
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Oh.

383
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,416
Hey, Sente!

384
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,416
Don't!

385
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:29,791
Right.

386
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:35,208
[in Tswana] As president
of the New Year's Eve planning committee,

387
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,708
-I welcome you to the first meeting.
-[in Zulu] Thank you.

388
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,583
Sorry, I'm late.

389
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm very sorry.

390
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,166
[in English] Welcome, everyone.

391
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,041
[in Zulu] Thank you, President.

392
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,458
As president,

393
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,458
[in English] I cannot wait
for the New Year's Eve concert.

394
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,666
-[in Zulu] It's going to be great!
-[in English] And fabulous!

395
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,125
-Super fabulous.
-Super-duper fabulous.

396
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,458
-Right.
-Yes.

397
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:06,541
[in Tswana] People, let's talk about
the things we gathered here for.

398
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,625
My daughter is getting married.
We'll be celebrating.

399
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,083
[in Zulu] Ladies, perhaps we should
move on to the business we came for.

400
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,166
[in English] Seconded.

401
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,541
Oh, no. I agree.

402
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,958
You're a wise man, Pastor.

403
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:27,916
[in Tswana] This year, I want
the concert to be bigger and better

404
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,166
than anything we've done before.

405
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:36,541
Last year, Sister Bongi tried her best.

406
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,250
We saw your efforts.

407
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:44,916
This time, I, Bridgette,
want to organize and plan everything.

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,750
Yes.

409
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,458
So we give our sister a rest.

410
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,666
Rest, Sister.

411
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,375
[in English] Okay, let's go. Let's go.

412
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,666
Let's move.

413
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,875
The parsley. The--

414
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:03,375
Why is it always so difficult to remember
that the parsley goes on this side?

415
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,916
Oh, no. We're so screwed.

416
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,375
The parsley
is on the wrong side of the plate.

417
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,833
Actually, you know what?

418
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,708
Why were you fired from your last job?

419
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,291
Because I punched the owner in the mouth.

420
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,166
Sir? A customer
is complaining about the soup.

421
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,583
-What?
-The soup.

422
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,333
But the soup's amazing.

423
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,250
This is ridiculous.

424
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,333
Thank you.

425
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,375
-Where are we going?
-There's the customer, sir.

426
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,375
Hi. Hello, hi. Yes, sir. Hi.

427
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,500
[in Zulu] I hear that you were complaining
about the soup.

428
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,166
-Yes.
-[in English] Yes, um.

429
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,875
What seems to be the problem with it?

430
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,166
I don't like the soup.

431
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,250
I hear you, but I need to know
what's actually wrong with it

432
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,291
because this is the most delicious soup
that I've tasted in my entire life.

433
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,625
I don't like it.

434
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,083
I think-- Maybe, just try it again, huh?

435
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,625
-I don't--
-Sir, let's do this.

436
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,250
Why don't we just try it again, you see?

437
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,375
There we go. Just--

438
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,291
-You know, just try-- Just give it--
-I don't want to--

439
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,916
-No!
-Please, sir! Just--

440
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,583
Just get out of my restaurant. Out!

441
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,541
[in Zulu] I want my tripe.

442
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,750
-I said get out!
-I want my tripe!

443
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,208
No one has ever fought for my food before.

444
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:18,166
Well, to be honest,
I've never fought for a girl before.

445
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,708
To defend her soup, or otherwise.

446
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,875
You've got a girl?

447
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,875
Why? Because of your looks?

448
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,041
-No.
-Right.

449
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,625
It's your personality.

450
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:32,875
No.

451
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,333
I'll have you know that
I've got high standards, okay?

452
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,583
I expect a partner to be disciplined
and to have a high moral code.

453
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,291
And, unfortunately,
that's difficult to find.

454
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:49,083
And now, I've only got a few weeks.

455
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:58,625
So, my mother is giving the family home

456
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,166
to whoever gets married
by the end of the year.

457
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:02,958
Seriously?

458
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,875
Yeah.

459
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,625
And if I don't get the house,

460
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,416
then I'll probably lose
this restaurant, so…

461
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,125
Right. So?

462
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,583
Let's get you a girl.
We'll start tomorrow.

463
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,500
-Sorry?
-Go home.

464
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,666
Get some sleep.

465
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,291
Dina, about those tattoos,
cover them up tomorrow.

466
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,833
Wear a long-sleeved top.

467
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,333
Well,

468
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,000
maybe it's time to tell our families.

469
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,125
I love you, and I know you love me, so--

470
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,125
So, we should just go public with it,
yeah?

471
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,833
I'm not ashamed.

472
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,208
No, I'm not.

473
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,916
[in Zulu] Listen, I have to go.

474
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,625
My mom just got here.

475
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,041
Who was that?

476
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,291
[in English] Um…

477
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,000
-It's my girlfriend.
-[laughs]

478
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:09,166
[in Zulu] I am going to miss this house.

479
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,375
[in English]
So, what are you looking for in a woman?

480
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay, well,
I've got this little spreadsheet here

481
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,208
-that I've printed. I just--
-Give me a summary.

482
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,708
A summary? Okay.

483
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,875
So, um,

484
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,833
she needs to be presentable,

485
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,541
orderly, very hygienic,

486
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,583
and respectful in her demeanor.

487
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,583
Because, you know,
my mom has to approve of her.

488
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,541
In other words, the total opposite of me.

489
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,041
Yes, the total opposite of you.

490
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,583
So, what if I--

491
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,750
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

492
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:48,125
Give you this sheet so that
you just have everything at your disposal.

493
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:51,125
And you will know
exactly what I'm looking for

494
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,500
and just what you need to--

495
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,000
It's all in here.

496
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,791
You caught all of that?

497
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,583
The first time.

498
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,083
Okay, sorry.

499
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,750
You are the professional.

500
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,541
Sure.

501
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,041
Spreadsheet.

502
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:15,916
What a nerd.

503
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,458
Whoa. There he is. Big guy.

504
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,458
Yeah. Look,
I just need to talk to her for a second.

505
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,375
That's not gonna happen.

506
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,875
She's in a presentation with
some very important clients right now. So…

507
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,958
Okay, cool. I'll wait for her at her desk.

508
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,416
No. Actually, she doesn't want you
to do that either.

509
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:42,291
-She told you that?
-Yeah. You're Sandile, right?

510
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,875
-Yes.
-Yeah, no.

511
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,375
She definitely
does not want you waiting in her office.

512
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,541
[in Zulu] Brother, who are you?

513
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,541
[in Sotho] They call me Thabo.
Because I make people happy.

514
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,958
[in Zulu] Dude, how do you forget

[in Zulu] Forget about her, baby.

693
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,208
Never mind. Forget about her.
It's just you and me, right?

694
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,375
[in English] This is about us.

695
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,958
What "us"?

696
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,125
[in Zulu] May we please start over?

697
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,625
[in English] Clean slate.

698
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:35,166
[in Tswana] I can only do that
if you tell me whose bra it is.

699
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,041
[in English] Come on now.

700
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,958
-[Zulu] You're still whining about that?
-Sandile, I just want to know the truth.

701
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,625
[in Tswana] How can we move forward
without settling the past?

702
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:46,958
Okay, baby.

703
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,541
-[in Zulu] You want the truth?
-[Sente] Yes.

704
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,500
Baby. One hundred, yeah?

705
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,458
-I don't know.
-[Sente scoffs]

706
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,250
I really don't know.

707
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,125
I was also seeing it for the first time.

708
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:01,750
I don't know who--
I don't know whose it is. I really--

709
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,041
[Sandile's stomach gurgling]

710
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,291
[in English] Sandile,
you have not changed a single bit.

711
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,375
I want to but I don't know--

712
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,375
-[groaning]
-[stomach gurgling loudly]

713
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,041
-What?
-Hey.

714
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,416
[clearing throat]

715
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,958
[in Zulu] There's something wrong.

716
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,416
Baby, please don't move.

717
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,458
I'll be right back! Don't go--

718
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,583
Hah! Baby. Sente.

719
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,041
Please don't go!

720
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,208
[in English] Babe! Please, babe!

721
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:25,833
Menzi!

722
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:26,958
[in Zulu] Menzi, you bastard!

723
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,083
I'll get you!

724
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,375
Move!

725
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,666
[whimpering]

726
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,333
[both laughing]

727
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,541
[Sandile yells]

728
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,291
Hey.

729
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,041
Hey, you!

730
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:55,250
Hey, these are beautiful.

731
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,000
How'd you get in here?

732
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,083
No.

733
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,375
How'd I get in?

734
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:02,958
My man, that's my job.
Don't worry about that.

735
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,958
You know what? Actually, you can stop this

736
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,541
because I'm going to get married and
my mother is going to give me her house.

737
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,875
I can sell it or take a loan against it--

738
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,166
Whoa.

739
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,916
Slow down. You're getting married?

740
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,875
Sandman, you're getting married?

741
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:21,750
Let me update, so they know that Sandman--

742
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,041
No.

743
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,458
No need for that.
I'm getting married soon.

744
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,875
But not soon, just soon soon.

745
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,833
I believe in you, man.

746
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,875
Congrats, bro! [laughs]

747
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:35,625
Yeah. Listen,
Bra Zakes doesn't care about that.

748
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,625
Bra Zakes just wants his money.

749
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:38,916
Or…

750
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,458
-I'll take the gold discs.
-No.

751
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,666
That's not gonna happen!

752
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,125
Listen here, Lunga.

753
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:49,666
This thing of you coming here
and doing as you please ends now.

754
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,041
Or what?

755
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,375
-What are you doing?
-Say "Pe".

756
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,791
Whoa.

757
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,041
What's "Pe"?

758
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,916
No. No, man. [whistles]

759
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,500
Here's "Pe". I hang with the bulldogs.

760
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,333
See?

761
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,791
Gents. The drums are leaving.

762
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,416
Ha-ha.

763
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,750
See what you did? What are you doing?

764
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,750
No, man.

765
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:15,958
Listen, my guy.

766
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,416
I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

767
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,166
You're my friend,
I like you. You know that.

768
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:25,000
Cool, Sand! Cool!

769
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,250
This guy!

770
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,000
Dude, it's a genius plan!

771
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,166
You and I will get married.

772
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,666
[in Tswana] Won't your
imaginary girlfriend get jealous?

773
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,083
[in English] Ugh, seriously now?

774
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,833
This will solve all of our problems.

775
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,333
I'll even beat my brothers.

776
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,416
Yeah.

777
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,583
You can even get the house, you know?

778
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,916
[in Zulu] And you can get your parents
off your back.

779
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,166
They're always telling you
to find a man, right?

780
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,416
[in Tswana] They won't believe us.

781
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,250
They'll take one look at you
and know we're faking it.

782
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,333
[in English] Hey.

783
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,041
I'm not gay.

784
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,083
Prove that to them then. Yoh!

785
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:09,000
[in Tswana] Ma Ngubeni, hello.

786
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,958
How have you been?

787
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,541
How's the blood pressure?

788
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,708
[in Zulu]
It was fine until she came along.

789
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:20,083
[in Tswana] People are saying
you're selling your house.

790
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,041
I was thinking, maybe I can buy it?

791
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:26,208
[in English]
For when Lemogang and I are married.

792
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,625
Actually,
the house is not for sale anymore.

793
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,625
I'm getting married.

794
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:38,666
[in Zulu] What? To who? How? When? Where?

795
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,083
[in English] Yeah, I'm engaged to Lynx.

796
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,541
My clothing model.

797
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:46,666
[Bongekile, Zulu] You're telling me that
all that time you spent in the studio,

798
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,791
you were actually doing something
that makes sense?

799
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,916
-Isn't this a miracle?
-Yeah.

800
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,416
A miracle.

801
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,250
Isn't it? It's a miracle!

802
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,083
A true miracle.

803
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,250
God works in mysterious ways!

804
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,958
He never slumbers or sleeps!

805
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,375
[in English] Hallelujah!

806
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:05,875
Hallelujah, Ma!

807
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,583
Amen!

808
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,666
Hallelujah!

809
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,041
Sente.

810
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,791
[in Tswana]
Sandile, we're in church, please.

811
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,458
-[in English] They set me up.
-Ugh.

812
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,375
[in Zulu] Please, give me another chance.
Please, baby. Please.

813
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,833
[Menzi, in English] So, I've decided

814
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,708
I'm un-quitting.

815
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,375
We'll start again
after the Christmas lunch for the orphans.

816
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,083
Sorry, what?

817
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,750
What Christmas lunch and what orphans?

818
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,208
And we're gonna need some decorations.

819
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,666
So, do--

820
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,000
[in Tswana]
Let's say you are straight, friend--

821
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,166
[in English] Which I am.

822
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,000
[in Tswana] You don't look it, friend.

823
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,083
[in English]
And my mom's already suspicious of me.

824
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,541
[in Tswana]
So let's start with the basics.

825
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,750
Let me see your walk.

826
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,500
-[in Zulu] Hold this.
-Okay.

827
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,541
-[in Tswana] Let's see.
-Mmm. Mmm.

828
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,041
[in English] Do the things.

829
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,333
[in Tswana] Oh, friend. Uh-uh.

830
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,416
Come back.

831
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,875
Hold this.

832
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,666
[in English] Have you heard of the Denzel?

833
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,750
In English,
they call it "engaging the core."

834
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,833
-Okay.
-Okay.

835
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,416
[in Zulu] See, friend?

836
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,708
-You're stiff.
-See, friend. No.

837
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,791
Now you try.

838
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:34,875
-Stiff!
-Stiff.

839
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:40,416
-No, friend, you're killing me. No.
-I got it, see?

840
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,583
Maybe the Denzel isn't for everyone.

841
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,291
Let's try the Idris. Okay.

842
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,458
-Chest out. Look, friend.
-Let me see, then.

843
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:48,958
See?

844
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,916
[in English] You gotta bounce with it.

845
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,041
-[in Zulu] The gangster walk?
-You know?

846
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,125
-No way.
-Yes.

847
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,541
No way.

848
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,166
-That's the one, right?
-Yeah.

849
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,250
It's the one!

850
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,125
My love.

851
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,958
-[in English] Yeah.
-We're nearly there.

852
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,708
Then.

853
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,375
-Trust me.
-Why are we doing this?

854
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,083
Baby?

855
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,416
[in Zulu] You will see.

856
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,625
[in English] But we're doing it for love.

857
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,500
[in Zulu] Almost there.

858
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:29,791
[in English] All right.

859
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:35,166
And we are here.

860
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,041
Okay.

861
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,625
I just wanted us to do something magical.

862
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:50,208
You know, just leave ourselves behind.
Just for an hour.

863
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,208
Shall we?

864
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,125
[scoffs]

865
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,958
I'm not looking for big gestures, Sandile.

866
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,583
That's not what I'm looking for.

867
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,458
[in Zulu] I know that.

868
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,833
For now, baby,
can we just enjoy the moment?

869
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:19,375
Listen. I understand that you think that
you still want to be with me.

870
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,416
But you still want to play.

871
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,708
[in English]
And prove a point to-- I don't know who.

872
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,833
But I want something solid
with someone solid.

873
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,500
And that's me, baby.

874
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,041
I'm solid. Solid as a rock.

875
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,750
[in Zulu] Baby, I've changed.

876
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:34,791
[in English] I have.

877
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,916
[in Zulu] It's still there, right?

878
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,541
[Sandile] Mm-hmm?

879
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,416
I know that smile.

880
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,625
Between us? You still love me.

881
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:50,875
[in English] Of course, I do.

882
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,791
I'll always love you.

883
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,500
But that's not the point.

884
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,791
That is the point, baby. That's the point.

885
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:57,916
[in Zulu] You and I,

886
00:44:58,583 --> 00:44:59,833
[in English] it's destiny.

887
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:01,208
[laughs]

888
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,166
I really can't believe you're going up.

889
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,833
[in Zulu] And you're so scared of heights.

890
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,500
You're something else, you know.

891
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,166
Let me tell you something.

892
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,583
So, I slipped the guy a hundred

893
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,750
and he promised me we won't take off.

894
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:17,875
-Yeah.
-A hundred?

895
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,333
[in English] Well, we've taken off.

896
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:27,875
-No, no, no.
-Sandile.

897
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,875
-[in Zulu] Sandile, wait.
-We have to get off.

898
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:30,916
-I must get off!
-Wait!

899
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,500
-I can jump!
-You'll fall! Please take us down.

900
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,291
[in English] Sandile!

901
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:38,083
You're mad! You're scared of heights
and you're jumping off?

902
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,541
[in Zulu] I'm falling!

903
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,291
[in English] Sandile. Look at me.

904
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,916
[Sandile yelling]

905
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,833
Breathe.

906
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:48,458
[Sandile hyperventilates]

907
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,333
Okay.

908
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,416
Do you trust me?

909
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,750
I trust you. Trust you.

910
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,458
Okay, you can let go now.

911
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,791
[sighs]

912
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:05,958
Baby.

913
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,750
[in Tswana] Are you okay?

914
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,416
-[in English] Yeah.
-Okay.

915
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,583
-[laughs]
-[Sandile pants]

916
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:24,000
-[Menzi] Ho ho ho!
-[children] Father Christmas!

917
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:26,041
Oh, my God.

918
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,750
They are making a mess. [chuckles]

919
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,375
Ho ho ho!

920
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:32,250
Okay. Hello.

921
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,208
Merry Christmas.

922
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,458
[yelps] Ow, ow, ow!

923
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,416
You got me. [chuckles]

924
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
You got me.

925
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,458
And this is why I don't like children.

926
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,750
[Zulu] And also, what do you have to do
with orphans anyway?

927
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,291
[in English]
I used to be at their orphanage.

928
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,375
Oh.

929
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:53,125
Yeah. At Christmas time,
some years we would have parties.

930
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:56,541
And we'd feel like we were normal too,
you know? Like we deserved nice things.

931
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,833
And other times, there wasn't a party.

932
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,666
Oh, I see. I didn't realize.

933
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,416
That's why when I see people fighting
with their families

934
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,625
instead of appreciating them,
I think, "Oh, what a bunch of idiots."

935
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,666
Guys, I have to be finished in an hour.

936
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,125
I've got lunch with Lynx and Ma.

937
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:17,875
[in Zulu] Oh, my!

938
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,708
[in English] You saved me.

939
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:29,041
[in Tswana] So much drama.

940
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,541
[in English] You were fine. You had it.

941
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,666
[in Zulu]
No, baby. You've always saved me.

942
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,750
Even when I get lost along the way,
you are always there for me.

943
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:37,625
[in English]
You're the only one who's there for me.

944
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,541
I've never deserved you.

945
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:48,541
Babe.

946
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:50,625
[in Zulu] I borrowed this--

947
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,291
I borrowed this ring
from my mother to impress you

948
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,250
but, I promise, when the moment is right,
when I have the money,

949
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,458
I'll buy you your own.

950
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,833
[in English] But, baby, please…

951
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,958
will you marry me?

952
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,416
Sandile.

953
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,916
Baby.

954
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,333
[in Zulu] My whole life.

955
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:12,750
[in English] My whole entire life
I have waited for someone like you.

956
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,666
But you were right here in front of me.

957
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:20,833
Please.

958
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,916
Who does the bra belong to?

959
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,750
Huh?

960
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,125
[in Tswana] Children lie
about their mistakes, Sandile,

961
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,625
[in English]
but you know what grown-ups do?

962
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,166
They own up to them.

963
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,416
So, who does the bra belong to?

964
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,083
[in Zulu] Baby, I promise you that--

965
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,625
[sighing, in English] Yeah.

966
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:49,666
It was nothing.

967
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:54,666
It meant nothing.

968
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,166
It was just some stupid girl.

969
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,125
[in Zulu] I've even forgotten her name.

970
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,583
[in English] Some wannabe singer.

971
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:04,333
It's what you always keep saying about me.

972
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:07,333
[in Zulu] That I keep doing stupid things,
trying to prove things.

973
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,916
It was stupid.

974
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,041
But, baby, I've changed. I know this.

975
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,583
Please believe me, baby, I--

976
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:24,333
Do you remember when we first met?

977
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:29,875
Listen, babe, you believed in me
when I couldn't even believe in myself.

978
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,333
So, please, baby. I'm begging you.

979
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:34,291
[in English] One more time.
Just please believe in me again.

980
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,625
[in Zulu] And you're right.

981
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:42,416
I've been an idiot and a child
throughout this entire relationship.

982
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
But I have changed, baby.

983
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,708
[in English]
I-- I can be that man that you want.

984
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,458
Please.

985
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,791
[Menzi] Ho ho ho. Seven.

986
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,916
[Dina] Nice. Next.

987
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,333
[Menzi] Ah! There you go.

988
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:07,916
Okay. Let's take the photo.
On three, cheese.

989
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,250
Three.

990
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,125
Cheese.

991
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,916
Um, I really have to
get going to the lunch now.

992
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,375
[Sandile, in Zulu] Hello, brethren! Um…

993
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:19,708
[in English] Ho ho. Dina.

994
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:22,458
I would like to introduce you… [laughs]

995
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:27,791
…to the future Mrs. Ngubeni.

996
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,000
No thanks to you guys.

997
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,291
[Menzi] Um, well… [clears throat]

998
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,916
…congratulations, Sente.

999
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,791
[in Tswana] Thank you, Menzi.

1000
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:42,000
[in English] Maybe you could
invite me to visit sometimes.

1001
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,916
-Yeah.
-What are you talking about?

1002
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You know what, baby?

1003
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,083
[Zulu] Let's leave them. They don't know
what they're talking about.

1004
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:50,208
[English] Well, now that Sandile has won,
the house is his.

1005
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,500
And it would be nice to visit.

1006
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:53,833
[in Zulu] Shut up, you!

1007
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,666
What are you talking about?

1008
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,458
He won the bet.

1009
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:59,625
[in Zulu] So,
since he's the first one to get married,

1010
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,458
[in English] he gets to keep the house.

1011
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,583
As a wedding gift, of course.

1012
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,791
How awesome is that?

1013
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,875
Hmm?

1014
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,583
Tell me he's lying.

1015
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,291
-Sandile.
-No.

1016
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:18,333
When he puts it that way,
I can see how it sounds wrong.

1017
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,541
How have you changed?

1018
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,041
Hmm?

1019
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:25,791
Tell me how I have saved you.

1020
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,750
But you just used me to win a bet.

1021
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,583
Baby, I've changed and you did.
You did save me.

1022
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:35,583
Sandile.

1023
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,875
I am begging you.

1024
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,750
If I ever meant anything to you

1025
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,083
ever…

1026
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:48,583
-don't ever call me.
-No, baby.

1027
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:51,416
Okay?

1028
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,458
Sente, please don't. Listen, it--

1029
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:55,958
[in Zulu] Baby, please.

1030
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,958
[in English] Baby. Sente. Baby.

1031
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,000
Sente, please.

1032
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,833
[Sandile] Sente.

1033
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:14,333
[Menzi] Uh, I'm sorry.

1034
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:15,625
[in Zulu] I'm sorry.

1035
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,583
-I'm sorry, Sandile. Come here.
-I'm gonna get you!

1036
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:19,666
Sandile, bro--

1037
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:21,625
[in English] Guys, there are kids here!

1038
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,125
That guy's hurting Santa. Let's go!

1039
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,250
Guys, there's kids here, man.

1040
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,833
-Guys.

You've got it in you.
I promise you, you've got it in you.

1216
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,291
You just--

1217
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:42,875
You just need to find that thing
that you are scared of and touch it.

1218
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:45,750
What is that?

1219
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:53,291
We're all afraid of something, right?

1220
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,666
All of us.

1221
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:01,708
Whether it's being hurt,

1222
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,333

1223
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,708
or not being seen.

1224

Whatever that thing is for you,

1225
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:14,250
I just need you to find that thing
in here.

1226

Touch it.

1227
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,291
And tell the music.

1228
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:34,166
Let's go again.

1229
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,791
[in Zulu] I thought you were joking.

1230
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,125
So, tell me, are you really doing this?

1231
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,625
We are doing this, Ma.

-Penny?
-Right.

1233
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:50,541
Because, this time, my heart will stop.

1234
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:53,708
It can't take any more nonsense.

1235
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:58,458
Rest assured, Mrs. Ngubeni. This is
a contract arrived at after due diligence.

1236
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:02,541
Both parties are aligned
in both context and structure.

1237
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:06,708
What I'm trying to say is,
we've considered everything.

Special dish for a special lunch.

01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,541
Stop it.

1244
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:38,750
[in Zulu] She's definitely different.
She's not like your usual chefs.

1245
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,000
[in English] No, she is--

1246
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,625
It's a very unprofessional look.

1247
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:46,000
But the food, right? The food is good?

1248

[Zulu] We were thinking of getting married
in the first week of January.

1249

So, by this time next year,
we'll have a baby.

1250

If family history is any indication,
likely a boy.

But that's not set in stone. Right?

1252
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,916
Of course.

01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:37,416
That way the house
is always home for all of us.

1734
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:39,291
Profoundly uninspired.

1735
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:41,041
So inspiring, my brother.

1736
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:42,416
Okay.

1737
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:49,375
-My goodness!
-Hey, stop. Stop it!

1738
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,791
-Menzi, boy!
-Hi, baby.

1739
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,000
My goodness.

1740
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,083
Okay.

1741
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,791
[in Zulu] That's my cue to go look
for my future Mrs. Ngubeni.

1742
01:35:00,416 --> 01:35:02,666
-You're leaving me too?
-Just like that.

1743
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:03,791
Okay.

1744
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:07,000
-[Kelz] From ten down to zero.
-Thank you, Jesus.

1745
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,458
[in English] Ten,

1746
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:10,291
nine, eight,

1747
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:12,291
seven, six,

1748
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:17,166
five, four, three, two, one!

1749
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:20,333
Happy New Year!

1750
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,166
[Kelz] Happy New Year!

1751
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:34,000
Happy New Year!

1752
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:34,416
So, you're a doctor.

1753
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,041
Dr. Khumalo.

1754
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:41,625
MBChB.

1755
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:45,875
So, you must have very good hygiene.
you, Jesus.
