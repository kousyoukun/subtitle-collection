5
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:15,333
美国狙击手

6
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,633
这里热得像个蒸笼
It's a fucking hotbox.

7
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,070
这里的土有股狗屎味
Man, the fucking dirt here tastes like dog shit.

8
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,260
- 说得好像你吃过一样  - 闭上你的臭嘴
- Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you?  - Shut the fuck up.

9
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,376
发现一青年男子 一边观察车队一边与人通话 完毕
I got a military-age male that's on a cell phone watching the convoy, over.

10
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:23,164
如果你认为他在汇报车队动向 你有权采取任何行动 你自己决定 完毕
If you think he's reporting troop movement, you have a green light. Your call. Over.

11
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,518
也许他只是打电话给他老妈
Maybe he's just calling his old lady.

12
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:35,657
他走了
He stepped off.

13
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:48,970
稍等 两百码外 一名妇女和一名孩子朝车队走去
Hold on. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

14
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,398
女的手臂不动 好像夹着东西
Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something.

15
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:06,910
她拿出来一枚手榴弹
Yeah, she's got a grenade.

16
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,280
她把一枚反坦手榴弹交给了那个孩子
She's got an RKG Russian grenade she just handed to the kid.

17
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,231
你说一名妇女和一名孩子?
You say a woman and a kid?

18
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:16,953
- 你看到没有? 能确定吗?  - 不能 你知道交战规定 你自己决定
- You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?  - Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.

19
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,725
哥们 如果你弄错了他们就会开掉你 把你一脚踢回莱文沃思
Man, they fry you if you're wrong. They send your ass to Leavenworth.

20
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,324
你打中了
You got it.

21
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,515
回来!
Hey, get back here!

22
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:04,118
- 永远不要把你的枪丢到地上  - 遵命
- You don't ever leave your rifle in the dirt.  - Yes, sir.

23
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:13,147
儿子 刚才那枪不错 你很有天赋
That was a hell of a shot, son. You got a gift.

24
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,196
你以后会成为一个出色的猎人
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.

25
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:19,837
在使徒行传中
Here in the Book of Acts,

26
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:23,779
保罗多次因为自己的信仰
several times, Paul stands in judgment

27
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,004
受到审判
for what he believes.

28
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,175
有时 我们都要那样做
And at times, we all have to do that.

29
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:30,691
我们没有站在他的立场
I mean, we don't see with his eyes,

30
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,437
所以不能理解他所作所为的神圣意义
so we don't know the glory of his plan.

31
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,421
展现在我们面前的生活就像那令人费解的镜像
Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror.

32
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,687
- 你在做什么?  - 当我们升天之日...
- What are you doing?   - And on the day we rise...

33
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:48,095
便会清晰看到并且理解保罗所作所为的奥秘所在
we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways.

34
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,296
一起祈祷吧
Let us pray.

35
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,335
这世界上有三种人...
There are three types of people in this world...

36
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:58,427
羊 狼和牧羊犬
Sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.

37
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:03,764
现在 有些人认为邪恶是不存在的
Now, some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world.

38
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:07,697
如果邪恶降临 他们都不知道如何保护自己
And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn't know how to protect themselves.

39
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:10,371
这些人就是羊
Those are the sheep.

40
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,234
然后掠食者出现了
And then you got predators.

41
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:16,856
他们使用暴力欺压弱者 他们就是狼
They use violence to prey on the weak. They're the wolves.

42
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:22,178
还有一种人 他们天生具有战斗力
And then there are those who've been blessed with the gift of aggression

43
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,165
和保护羊群的强烈本能
and the overpowering need to protect the flock.

44
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:31,038
这些人很稀有 并能与狼对抗
These men are the rare breed that live to confront the wolf.

45
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,809
他们就是牧羊犬
They are the sheepdog.

46
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,113
我们这个家不培养羊
Now, we're not raising any sheep in this family.

47
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,049
如果你们变成狼我就抽你们的屁股
And I will whup your ass if you turn into a wolf.

48
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,949
韦恩
Wayne.

49
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,356
但我们要保护自己
But we protect our own.

50
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,561
今后 如果有人要揍你
Now, if someone tries to fight you

51
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,817
或者欺负你弟弟 你们要自己解决
or tries to bully your little brother, you have my permission to finish it.

52
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,436
是那家伙找杰夫的麻烦
The guy was picking on Jeff.

53
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,942
- 是这样吗?  - 是的
- Is that true?  - Yes, sir. Yes, he was.

54
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,514
你们自己解决了吗?
Did you finish it?

55
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:15,430
那你们就知道自己是谁了
Well, then you know who you are.

56
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:21,128
知道你们的目标是什么了
You know your purpose.

57
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,094
克里斯・凯尔今晚骑的是一匹名叫"大小姐"的马
Chris Kyle is on the horse Big Mistress here this evening.

58
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:30,031
你没问题的
You're all right.

59
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,101
准备好了
Now, get ready.

60
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,029
很好
That's good.

61
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:41,608
今晚他要冲刺目前的最高分 86分
So, tonight, he needs to beat the leading score of 86.

62
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,963
杰夫 你哥好像又赢了
Hey, Jeff. Looks like your brother did it again.

63
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:13,943
克里斯・凯尔
Chris Kyle.

64
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:18,596
老兄 那里又不是没人 你还戴着皮带扣出来
Man, wasn't nobody there. You come out with a belt buckle.

65
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,483
- 你戴它干什么?  - 戴着它上床
- What are you supposed to do with it?  - Supposed to get laid with it.

66
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,569
我要戴着它 看看能不能引起萨拉的兴致
I'm gonna wear it and see if it puts Sarah in the mood.

67
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,404
见鬼 一场大风都能让萨拉兴致勃勃
Shit, a strong wind'll put Sarah in the mood.

68
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:26,838
他们是这么说的吗?
Oh, is that what they say?

69
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,106
老兄 你知道高中时候他们是怎么叫她的
Man, you know what they called her in high school.

70
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,175
- 好了 别说了  - 爱吸的萨拉...
- All right. Don't say it.  - Sarah sucks-a-lotta...

71
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,278
- 没听到我说什么吗?  - 见鬼 克里斯
- What'd I say?  - Shit, Chris.

72
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:33,631
该死的
Goddamn it.

73
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:44,163
- 花钱不少啊 那两个姑娘 这就是为什么...  - 别扯了
- That was bucking money, those two girls. And that's why...  - No.

74
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,927
他一直盯着她看 这就是为什么上次...
He kept looking... He had his eyes on her, and that's why, the last time...

75
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,029
- 你一会儿就知道它的威力了  - 好吧
- Wait till you see what this does.  - Yeah.

76
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,897
答案马上揭晓!
Let's find out!

77
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:55,001
嘿 宝贝 谁想和牛仔明星上床? 搞什么鬼?
Hey, baby. Who wants to fuck a rodeo star? What the fuck?

78
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,068
你不是说明天才回来
You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow.

79
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,436
- 我说什么?  - 不 是我没有...
- I said what?  - No, I just didn't...

80
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:00,662
克里斯 放开他好吗? 他什么也没干!
Chris, just leave him alone, all right? He didn't do anything!

81
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:04,142
- 我什么都不知道 救命!  - 克里斯 放开他!
- I didn't know shit, man. Help!  - Chris, leave him alone!

82
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:08,681
混蛋克里斯 放开他! 该死的! 你怎么回事?
Fucking Chris, leave him alone! Goddamn it! What is wrong with you?

83
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,685
- 他什么也不知道 是吗?  - 他不知道? 你不知道什么?
- He didn't know, all right?  - Oh, he didn't know? What didn't you know?

84
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,966
- 把帽子还给我  - 给他帽子 宝贝
- Just give me my hat.  - Get his hat, baby.

85
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,356
他不知道什么? 你以为这些枪是谁的?
He didn't know what? Whose rifles did you think those were?

86
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,140
这些男人衣服都是她的吗? 这些你都不明白?
Those clothes, those men's clothes weren't hers? Is that what you didn't know?

87
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,629
你到底怎么回事?! 你不能这样见人就打!
What the fuck is wrong with you?! You don't have to fucking punch everyone!

88
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:26,014
带上你的帽子赶紧滚
Put that fucking hat on and get the fuck out.

89
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,419
你到底怎么回事?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

90
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,939
滚出去
Get out.

91
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,608
我不知道你想要我怎么样
You know what? I don't know what you expect from me.

92
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,579
你把我扔在这里 每个该死的周末都和你弟弟跑出去
You drag me out here and then you run off with your brother every damn weekend.

93
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,948
你觉得我为什么这么做?
Why do you think I did this?

94
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:45,599
我需要有人关注! 你不明白吗?
I do this to get attention! Don't you get that?

95
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,072
收拾你的的东西 滚出去
Get your stuff and get out.

96
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:54,377
好 去你的 我走
Fine. Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fine.

97
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,663
你以为参加比赛你就是个牛仔了
You think you're a cowboy 'cause you rodeo.

98
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,783
你根本不是什么牛仔 你就是个脏兮兮的牧场工
You're not a cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch hand.

99
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,353
你就是个该死的混蛋
And you're a shitty fucking lay.

100
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,193
别说风凉话
Don't say it.

101
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,129
你们打算什么时候结婚?
When's the wedding?

102
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,306
我知道你的意思 但是...
I understand what you're saying, but...

103
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:22,338
要知道我们应该游遍全州
You know, we get to travel over the whole state.

104
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:25,310
每周末去不同的城市
Different city every weekend.

105
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,473
与野马和公牛为伴
Broncs and steers.

106
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,799
- 我不知道 也许她说得对  - 她说得对?
- I don't know. Maybe she's right, though.  - She's right?

107
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:37,044
她说对什么了? 她说得不对 老兄 我们就是牛仔
Right about what, Chris? She's not right, man. We're cowboys.

108
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,140
- 我们生活在梦想中  - 下面是一则特别报道
- We're living the dream.  - This is a special report.

109
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,317
美国驻坦桑尼亚达累斯萨拉姆使馆
Those explosions set to go off at the U.S. embassies

110
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,244
和肯尼亚内罗毕使馆发生连环爆炸
in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya,

111
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:48,648
爆炸显然是某些人针对美国发动的战争行为
were clearly a part of someone's war against the United States.

112
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:53,454
两起爆炸工造成80多人丧命 1700多人受伤...
More than 80 dead, more than 1,700 injured in two bomb blasts today...

113
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:56,090
嘿 杰夫 快看
Hey, Jeff. Jeff. Hey.

114
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,348
- 距离250英里  - 快看
- 250 miles apart.  - Look at this.

115
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,845
目前尚不清楚我们的敌人是谁
It is still unclear at this hour who our enemy is.

116
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,563
不过很显然使馆是他们的袭击目标
Although the embassies were obviously the targets...

117
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:07,033
- 看看他们对我们做了什么  - 伤者不是美国公民
- Look what they did to us.  - And injured are not Americans.

118
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:13,498
仍有八名美国公民遇难 其中包括一名儿童 五名美国人失踪
Still, eight Americans, including one child, are dead, and five are still missing.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,498
征兵站

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,579
- 你来自德州  - 是的 长官
- So, you're from Texas.  - Yes, sir.

121
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,115
- 你很爱国  - 是的 长官
- You're a patriot.  - Yes, sir.

122
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:25,119
- 你被他们惹毛了  - 我要为美国服役
- And you're pissed off.  - I'm looking to be of service.

123
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,138
- 你喜欢战斗?  - 是的 长官
- You like to fight?  - Yes, sir.

124
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:31,645
你喜欢战斗 好的 想不想见识一下精英战士?
You like to fight. Okay. Well... Why don't you meet the warrior elite?

125
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:35,813
- 海豹突击队  - 是的 海陆空全能
- SEALs.  - Yep. Sea, air, and land.

126
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:37,665
我水性不怎么好 长官
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir.

127
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:41,494
不好? 我们这里不欢迎胆小鬼 多数人都被淘汰或主动退出了
No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a heart. Most men, they wash out, they quit.

128
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,857
长官 我不是多数人 我绝不言弃
But I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.

129
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,944
- 要来点正经的了 伙计们!  - 坚持住! 姑娘们! 坚持住!

- Did I ask you to open up your mouth?  - Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle.

我们需要个小点的靶子 老兄 我们用一下你的胳膊吧
Hey, we want a smaller target, we'll use your arm, man.

184
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:02,155
- 你好  - 嗨

我能... 请你喝一杯吗?
Can I... get you a drink?

188
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:14,419
一杯酒能让你看起来更加高大有魅力?
Will a drink make you six inches taller and charming?

189
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,913
- 它能让你变回未婚状态?  - 我没有结婚...
- Will it make you not married?  - I'm not...

190
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:20,190
好吧 我刚才看见你把婚戒摘了 好吗?
Yeah. I just watched you take your ring off, okay?

191
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,412
别当无赖 回家吧
Don't be a scumbag. Go home.

192
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,583
天啊
Oh, my God.

193
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,755
- 可能是因为你穿了皮裤吧  - 是吗?
- It may have been the leather pants.  - Oh, yeah?

194
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,508
姑娘穿什么样的裤子才能不被骚扰呢?
What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone?

195
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:40,043
灯芯绒裤吧
Well, maybe corduroy.

196
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,112
你们这群人就是这样吗?
I mean, is that how it is with you guys?

197
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,083
你们三杯酒下肚 就成单身汉了?
You're, like, suddenly single after three beers?

198
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,802
不 三杯酒下肚 我就想要第四杯
Oh, no. After three beers, all I know is to get a fourth.

199
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,988
很好 标准农民作风
Oh, that's great. That's great. Real redneck.

200
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:54,506
我不是农民 我来自德州
Oh, I'm not a redneck. I'm from Texas.

201
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,293
有什么区别吗?
What's the difference?

202
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:59,180
我们骑马 它们一家人互骑
Well, we ride horses and they ride their cousins.

203
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,099
你是做什么的? 显然你是个军人
What do you do for work? You're obviously military.

204
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,735
我是给海豚洗澡的 圈养的海豚
I polish dolphins. They're in captivity.

205
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,703
我只是把它们身上的脏东西擦掉
What I do is just sort of scrape off the crustaceans.

206
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:11,081
- 你觉得我很蠢吗?  - 不 说实话 你看起来不太开心
- Do I look stupid to you?  - No. Honestly, you look a little sad.

207
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:19,165
- 我... 我的身高可以请你喝一杯吗?  - 你得先告诉我你是做什么的
- Am I... tall enough to buy you a drink?  - Not until you tell me what you do.

208
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,166
好吧 这样如何? 嘿 格雷格
Okay. How about this? Hey, Greg?

209
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,390
给我两个杯子 一杯酒一个问题怎么样?
Get two shots. How 'bout we do a shot for a question?

210
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,808
你每问我一个问题 我回答完 你要喝一杯酒 反过来也一样
Every time you ask me a question and I answer, you got to do a shot. Same, vice versa.

211
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,143
游戏开始
Game on.

212
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:31,729
这瓶酒就留在这吧 好 问吧
You can leave the bottle, too. Okay, shoot.

213
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,400
显然你是个军人 哪个部队的?
All right. You're obviously military. What branch?

214
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,537
我刚结束体能训练 马上要去狙击培训学校
I just finished BUD/S, heading to sniper school.

215
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,258
- 真的? 你是海豹突击队的?  - 没错
- Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?  - Yes, ma'am.

216
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,178
- 这是第二个问题了  - 该死
- That's two questions.  - Shit.

217
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,269
真的?
Really?

218
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:54,295
哦 你没必要真喝掉的
Oh, I didn't really mean you had to do that.

219
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,621
好吧 该死
Okay. Shit.

220
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,574
我知道你们这些人 我妹妹以前和一个海豹陆战队员订过婚
I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL.

221
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,195
- 真的?  - 没错
- Oh, was she?  - Yeah.

222
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,262
等等 什么叫你知道我们这些人? 你想说什么?
Hold on. How you know all about us? What do you mean?

223
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:09,019
我想说你们是一群自命不凡 自我为中心的混蛋
What I mean is, you're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie

224
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:13,255
你们劈腿 为所欲为 我绝对不会和一个海豹陆战队员约会的
and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want. I'd never date a SEAL.

225
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,758
等等 你为什么说我以自我为中心? 我能为我的国家献出生命
Wait. Why would you say I'm self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country.

226
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,245
为什么?
Why?

227
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,680
因为这是世界上最伟大的国家 我要尽全力保护它
'Cause it's the greatest country on earth, and I'd do everything I can to protect it.

228
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,667
听着 我很遗憾你妹妹遇人不淑 但我不是那样的人
Look, I'm sorry what happened to your sister, but that's not me.

229
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,556
- 很高兴认识你  - 你要去哪里?
- It's nice to meet you.  - Where are you going?

230
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,660
回家 你说你不会和一个海豹突击队员谈恋爱 所以...
Well, I was just gonna go home because you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so...

231
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,847
我只是说我从没嫁过罢了
I said I'd never marry one.

232
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:42,602
好吧 那么 也许... 你好 很高兴认识你 你叫什么名字?
Oh, okay. Well, then maybe, hello. Nice to meet you. What's your name?

233
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,520
- 塔雅  - 塔雅

Chris. I'm Chris Kyle. Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

235
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:54,096
你认为你能保护我们所有人 这有点自大 不是吗?
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris?

236
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,868
好吧 我们体能指挥官说有三样...
Well, our BUD/S officer commander said that it's three...

237
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:03,948
他说有三样东西我们必须当心 自大 酒和女人
Okay. He said there's three things we got to worry about: Ego, booze, and women.

238
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:08,125
好吧 听起来你有危险了
Well, sounds like you're under attack.

239
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,431
你很漂亮
You're pretty.

240
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,653
你很可爱
You're so cute.

241
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,305
我帮你
I got you.

242
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,688
我不会跟你回家的 想都别想
I'm not going home with you, so don't even think about it.

243
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,419
感觉身体里的每个细胞都在呼吸
Feel breath filling every cell in your body.

244
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,356
这是我们的仪式
This is our ritual.

245
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,393
当我们掌控自己的呼吸 掌控自己的思想时
We master our breath, we master our mind.

246
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,213
扣动扳机甚至不需要意识
Pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort.

247
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,117
你会感觉到 但不要去指挥它
You will be aware of it, but not directing it.

248
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,953
呼气时 找到你自然产生的呼吸间歇
And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause

249
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,345
和心跳间的停顿
and the space between heartbeats.

250
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,476
你好 我是塔雅 我不方便接电话 请留言 我会尽快回电
Hey. This is Taya. I can't get to the phone. Leave a message. I'll call you back.

251
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:33,013
嗨 又是我 那个被你吐了一鞋的人
Hey, it's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on.

252
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,850
那个... 我想你可能没收到我的上一条留言
So... yeah, I was thinking maybe you didn't get that last message,

253
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,803
我留的那条 或者... 再上一条 所以我想...
the last message I left, or... the one before that. So I figured that...

254
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:44,375
- 你想怎么?  - 嗨 你好吗? 一切都好吗?
- You figured what?  - Hey. How are you? How've you been?

255
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,993
还不错
Good.

256
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:50,030
那就好 嗯 你在做什么?
Good. Wow. What are you up to?

257
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,950
什么也没做 你呢?
Not a lot. You?

258
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:56,176
我也没 就是... 很高兴能跟你说话
No, just... excited to talk to you.

259
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,775
瞄准物小 失误也小
Aim small, miss small.

260
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,399
如果你瞄准一粒衬衫纽扣 你可能会打偏两英寸
If you aim for a shirt button, you might miss by 2 inches.

261
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:12,185
但如果你瞄准他的衬衫 那你可能打偏两英尺
If you aim for his shirt, you might miss by 2 feet.

262
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:21,679
- 你最好把弹着点收紧 凯尔  - 是 长官
- You better close those groupings, Kyle.  - Yes, sir.

263
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,214
天啊
God.

264
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,204
- 不错 这样我们能赢到什么?  - 上面一排的
- Not bad. What do we get for that?  - Top shelf.

265
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,340
- 我喜欢那一个 棕色的那个  - 当然 拿着
- I like that one. Brown one.  - Sure. Here you go.

266
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,476
- 太好了 谢谢你 先生 祝你愉快  - 看呀! 谢谢
- Great. Thank you, sir. Have a good day. - Oh, look! Thank you.

267
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:38,011
- 你好  - 噢 很好 你抱着它很好看
- Hello.  - Oh, good. That looks good on you.

268
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,942
你一直都想做个军人吗?
So, did you always want to be a soldier?

269
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,459
不 我过去想当个牛仔 但是...
No. I wanted to be a cowboy, but...

270
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,221
我也不清楚 我做到了 然后就打算做点别的
I don't know. I did that. Thought I was meant for something more.

271
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,922
所以你就开始在酒吧里拯救女孩子了?
So you started rescuing girls from bars?

272
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,908
我想我是在你手里救出了那间酒吧
I think I rescued that bar from you.

273
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,381
- 你喜欢乡村音乐吗?  - 只有在消沉的时候才喜欢
- You like country music?  - Only when I'm depressed.

274
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,253
- 那孩子呢? 你想要孩子嘛?  - 是啊 将来某一天吧
- How about kids? You want kids?  - Yeah, someday.

275
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,922
我妈妈说看我的鼻子就知道我会选错男人
My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men.

276
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,710
这话对女孩说太糟糕了
Well, that's a shitty thing to say to a girl.

277
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,129
我已经证明了她是对的
Well, I've proven her right.

278
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,781
那就是错误的选择让你站在这里
Then wrong picks put you here,

279
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,590
让你变成现在的自己 我喜欢这样的你
made you who you are. I like who you are.

280
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,875
你想过如果那支枪的对面站的是一个真人会怎样吗?
You ever think about what happens when there's a real person on the end of that gun?

281
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,774
我不知道 我只希望当那一天到来时我可以胜任我的工作
I don't know. I just hope I can do my job when that day comes.

282
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,280
我们是在盯着同一个目标吗? 你根本就是在打沙子
Are we looking at the same target? You're spitting dust.

283
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,968
不过别担心 我们总是能用医护兵替下那些不能射击的人
And don't worry. We can always use corpsmen for the guys who can't shoot.

284
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,794
噢 该死
Oh, fuck.

285
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:19,566
- 你在发抖  - 我知道
- You're trembling.  - I know it.

286
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,434
- 如果你不想我们可以不这样做...  - 不 我想 真的
- We don't have to do this if you don't...  - No, I want to. I do.

287
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:25,120
- 是吗?  - 你这么的真实 这让我很害怕
- Yeah?  - You just feel real and it scares me.

288
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,675
你是闭着眼射的吗?
You got your off-eye shut?

289
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,404
如果我闭上眼 我就什么也看不见了
Well, if I close my off-eye, then I can't see what's out there.

290
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,408
- 那里除了靶子什么都没有  - 不 长官 那里有东西
- There's nothing out there but the target.  - Negative. Sir, there is something out there.

291
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:46,993
那就击中它
Punch it.

292
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:51,601
俯卧撑有用吗? 做50个 凯尔 注意安全
Will push-ups help? Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe.

293
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,907
当它呼吸时我发挥得更好
I'm better when it's breathing.

294
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,928
- 这时另一架...  - 天啊 克里斯!
- what appears to be another...  - Oh, my God. Chris!

295
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,413
- 怎么了?  - 不!
- What's wrong?  - No!

296
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:12,871
以下是视频资料 你可以看见第一架飞机似乎是从东面飞来
Here's the tape. You see the first plane coming in from what looks like the east side.

297
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,414
它冒着火冲进了大厦
And it goes into the building with the flames

298
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:18,975
从大厦另一端冒出了浓烟
and the smoke billowing out the other side of the tower.

299
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:23,246
我很难说准哪一面是北边 哪一面是南边
It's hard for me to tell exactly which is the north side and which is the south side.

300
00:22:23,346 --> 00:22:25,682
但看起来烟是从大厦北面冒出
But it appears it's coming out of the north side there.

301
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:28,837
继而 不久之前 就发生了这惊人的一幕
And then, moments ago, these incredible images.

302
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:33,173
这应该是第一次 大厦南塔倒塌了
I believe that's the first one. That's the south tower collapsing.

303
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:37,243
这看起来像你见过的大厦爆破
It almost looks like one of those implosions of buildings that you see,

304
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:42,787
但这不是可控的爆破 这是一场大破坏
except there is nothing controlled about this. This is devastation.

305
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,843
你甚至都不了解我
You don't even know me.

306
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:57,255
我了解你够多了 你很完美 宝贝
I know enough. You are a package deal, babe.

307
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,908
- 你在害怕什么?  - 没什么
- What are you so afraid of?  - Nothing.

308
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:11,312
每件事都让我害怕 我也不知道 如果我们成不了怎么办?
Everything. I don't know. What if it doesn't work out?

309
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:16,133
我们会结婚 然后会组建一个家庭
We're gonna get married and then we're gonna start a family.

310
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,547
你都计划好了 是不是?
You got it all planned out, don't you?

311
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:21,690
没错
I'm done.

312
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:23,847
我爱你
I love you.

313
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,480
如果你语气这么坚定 那你需要一枚戒指哦
Well, you're gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that.

314
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,185
好的
Okay.

315
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:43,276
女士们 先生们 有请克里斯・凯尔夫妇!
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle!

316
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:55,466
你脖子上是什么玩意?
What the hell is on your neck?

317
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,658
你的脖子 上面好像沾了些绿油漆
Your neck. You've got, like, green paint all over you.

318
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:00,267
你会相信吗 宝贝 如果我告诉你我刚刚做了静脉注射
Would you believe me, babe, if I told you I had an I.V.

319
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,614
我两小时之前全身都是绿色的
and I was all green about two hours ago?

320
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:04,616
你... 你说什么?
What are you... what?

321
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:07,419
- 这是我的一部分 宝贝  - 天啊	
- It's a package deal, babe.  - Oh, my God.

322
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,537
给我过来
Come here, you.

323
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:12,873
谢谢
Cheers to that.

324
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:15,032
什么事 长官?
What's the word, chief?

325
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:18,328
刚刚接到命令 伙计们 开始了!
Just got the call, boys. It's on!

326
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:20,510
噢耶!
Hooyah!

327
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,477
干杯!
Shots!

328
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,317
很好!
Yes!

329
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,248
五杯
Five shots.

330
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,444
太好了!
Yeah!

331
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,911
- 只有六个星期 宝贝  - 我很害怕 宝贝
- It's only gonna be six weeks, baby.  - I'm so afraid, baby.

332
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:39,317
那应该是敌人说的 你没什么好怕的
That's what they say. You got nothing to be afraid of.

333
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,215
- 你在说...  - 这都是计划的一部分
- What are you...  - It's all part of the plan.

334
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:45,702
你的心脏都快蹦出来了
Your heart is beating out of your chest.

335
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:49,777
这只是因为不是一个人去参加战争 仅此而已
That's just 'cause I'm not the only one that's going to war. That's all.

336
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:52,749
干杯!
Cheers!

337
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
第一次海外部署

338
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:09,313
欢迎来到费卢杰 古老中东的新狂野西部
Welcome to Fallujah. The new wild west of the old Middle East.

339
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:12,950
基地组织已经悬赏你们的人头 现在世界各地的
AQI put a price on your heads, and now extremists from around the globe

340
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,695
极端分子都汹涌而来想要你们的命 狙击手们...
are flooding the borders to collect on it. You snipers...

341
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,027
你们每人会被分配一名海军陆战队员保护你们进入主路
you're gonna be paired with a marine to watch your back and inserted along the main road

342
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,296
掩护第一批海陆队员进行上门搜查
to do overwatch for 1st marines going door to door.

343
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:27,333
你们的工作是不惜一切代价保护好那些队员
Your job is to protect those marines at all costs.

344
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:29,601
城市已经被疏散
This city has been evacuated.

345
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:34,056
任何一个还待在这里的已到参军年龄的男子... 都是要来杀你们的
Any military-age male who is still here... is here to kill you.

346
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:38,577
我们要安全把逮捕这些 然后平安地回家
Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home.

347
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,747
下 下 下!
Out, out, out!

348
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:02,250
最好把头低下 德州男
I'd keep that head down, Tex.

349
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,553
伊军也有狙击手的 你知道的
Muj got snipers, too, you know.

350
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:08,192
狙击手不会瞄你的头的
A sniper won't aim for your head.

351
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:15,043
伙计 他们有个从500码外就可以爆头的狙击手
Man, they got this one sniper that's been hitting head shots from 500 yards out.

352
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,202
他们叫他穆斯塔法
They call him Mustafa.

353
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:24,290
他还参加过奥运会
He's in the Olympics.

354
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,449
奥运会现在还有狙击这个项目?
They got sniping in the Olympics now?

355
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:45,772
稍等 两百码外 一名妇女和一名孩子朝车队走去
Hold on. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

356
00:26:50,816 --> 00:26:53,153
女的手臂不动 好像夹着东西
Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something.

357
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:06,215
她拿出来一枚手榴弹 她把一枚反坦手榴弹交给了那个孩子
She's got a grenade. She's got an RKG Russian grenade she just handed to the kid.

358
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,040
你说一名妇女和一名孩子?
You say a woman and a kid?

359
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:13,556
- 你看到没有? 能确定吗?  - 不能 你知道交战规定 你自己决定
- You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?  - Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.

360
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:17,696
哥们 如果你弄错了他们就会开掉你 把你一脚踢回莱文沃思
Man, they fry you if you're wrong. They send your ass to Leavenworth.

361
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,840
我靠 太牛掰了
Fuck, that was gnarly.

362
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,840
这个邪恶的婊子
Fucking evil bitch.

363
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,810
起来 继续前进
Get up. Keep moving.

364
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,915
- 射得好 德州男 真神了  - 收到 干得漂亮 海军
- Nice shooting, Tex. Hell of a call.  - Roger that. Good looking out, Navy.

365
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,361
- 你听到了吗 哥们?  - 别碰我
- Fuck, did you hear that, man?  - Get the fuck off me.

366
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:40,728
其他人呢?
Where is everybody?

367
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:44,565
我们在休整 我们在训练那些该死的哈吉士兵
We're just checking our dicks here, man. We're training those fucking Hajji soldiers.

368
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:45,882
是吗 那你为什么不去呢?
Yeah, why aren't you out there?

369
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:51,238
- 我有事  - 什么事 看漫画书?
- Well, I have the shits.  - What, reading a comic book?

370
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:54,529
这明明是漫画小说 伙计 跟漫画区别大了
It's a fucking graphic novel, man. There's a big difference.

371
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,814
我听说你在外面开枪了
I heard you were on fucking fire out there.

372
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:03,093
马克・李进来了 说你完成了你的首杀 是吗?
Marc Lee came in, said you popped your cherry. Is that right?

373
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:06,923
是个孩子... 他连毛都没长齐
There was a kid who... barely had any hair on his balls.

374
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:09,375
他妈妈给了他一枚榴弹
Mother gives him a grenade,

375
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:11,993
派他去炸海军陆战队
sends him out there to kill marines.

376
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:20,167
老兄 我从没见过这么恶毒的事情
Dude, that's evil like I never seen before.

377
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,441
是的 但是 听着哥们
Yeah. But, hey, man,

378
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,575
你知道那个孩子可能会杀掉十个海陆队员 对吧?
you know that kid could have taken out like 10 fucking marines, right?

379
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:26,743
是的 但我把他杀了
Yeah, but I killed him.

380
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,877
你只是尽了你的职责 这就足够了
You did your job. That's the end of the story.

381
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,630
是啊 只是这跟我想象中的首杀不一样
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned that first one to go down.

382
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:40,212
莱利 没关系 没实际看到
Riley, it's okay. Don't have the actuals.

383
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,218
我靠! 什么玩意?
Fuck, man! What the hell?

384
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:56,991
那是你的掩护 爱因斯坦 你可以待会再谢他
That was your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later.

385
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,094
行动!
Let's move!

386
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:04,430
继续前进
Keep going.

387
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,439
加快速度
Hurry up.

388
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:21,554
散开@
Disperse!

389
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:31,809
停火! 停火!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

390
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,395
注意屋顶! 紧盯那里!
Eyes on the rooftop! Keep your eyes up there!

391
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:50,415
有人倒地! 有人倒地! 我们这里需要医护人员!
Man down! Man down! We need a corpsman over here now!

392
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,895
发现敌军狙击手 大致方位
Enemy sniper located. Approximate grid, Quebec-Romeo,

393
00:32:53,995 --> 00:32:57,239
为QR155604
1-5-5-6-0-4.

394
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:07,427
- 闻起来像尿一样  - 是啊...
- Smells like piss in here.  - Yeah, well...

395
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,811
你成功掩护了我们 伙计 那几枪真漂亮
You covered our asses out there, man. Some ballsy shots.

396
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,955
- 靠 他们手里没武器是吧?  - 是的
- Fuck. They were clean, right?  - Hell yeah, they were.

397
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:16,473
那个该死的狙击手竟敢动手!
That fucking sniper went right up our ass!

398
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:19,090
是啊 不过我审问出这里的防御细节 不会再发生这种事了
Yeah, I already chewed out security detail. It ain't gonna happen again.

399
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,711
最好不要再发生了
It better not happen again.

400
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:22,980
- 四百米外有个热点  - 好吧
- There's a hot spot 400 meters out.  - All right.

401
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,683
我要去写狙击手陈述
I'm gonna go write up some shooter statements.

402
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:28,119
- 你干掉了几个人?  - 六个... 噢 不对 我说错了
- How many'd you get?  - I got six... oh. No, that's not true.

403
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:31,700
我干掉八个 但他们拿掉了两个
I got eight, but they dragged two off.

404
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,461
- 你射杀了六个?  - 是啊 怎么了? 有什么问题?
- You got six?  - Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

405
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:36,827
没什么 你比其他狙击手加在一起干掉的都多
Nothing. You just got more than the rest of the snipers combined.

406
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:40,472
- 是 但是他们也杀了我们一个  - 你总不能射杀你看不到的人
- Yeah, but they got one of us.  - You can't shoot what you can't see.

407
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,853
他妻子说他拿着一本可兰经
His wife said he was carrying a Koran.

408
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:49,140
听着 我不知道可兰经长什么样 但是我可以告诉你他拿着什么
Look, I don't know what a Koran looks like, but I can tell you what he was carrying.

409
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,643
那是个压型金属 弹型7.26s
It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s,

410
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,903
它看起来就像一把AK-47 你说他拿的是什么
and it looked just like an AK-47. So you tell me what he was carrying.

411
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:08,160
噢 他来了 他来了
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

412
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,162
女士们先生们 听我说! 我们之中诞生了一个传奇人物!
Ladies and genitals, listen up! We have a legend in our midst!

413
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,998
让我们以热烈的掌声欢迎"传奇"!
Round of applause for The Legend!

414
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:17,001
就是这样 我们为你的凯旋而感到骄傲 小伙子
There we go. We're so proud of you back home on the range, boy.

415
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:20,005
据说... 据说这个传奇人物
Now, it's been... it's been said that The Legend here

416
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,907
可以一口气杀死一百个人
can kill 100 men with one blow.

417
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,090
或者 不 应该是... 什么是... 不 应该是...靠 是什么来着?
Or, no, it was... what was... nah, it was... fuck. What was it?

418
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,431
是...是每人吹一次...他吹了一百个...男人
It was one... one blow from a single man. He blew 100... men.

419
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:34,303
他还是单身 而且...我去! 真是的!
And he's single. And... Goddamn it! Shit!

420
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:35,938
噢 天啊!
Oh, shit!

421
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:37,722
- 你妹  - 该死
- Damn, man.  - Oh, fuck.

422
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:40,192
你想来场食物大战吗? 来啊
You want a food fight? Come on.

423
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:44,252
- 讨厌  - 这是让你闭嘴的唯一方式 
- Shit.  - Only way to shut you up.

424
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:48,266
你杀人了吗?
Have you killed anyone yet?

425
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:52,604
这可不应该是打电话该聊的啊 宝贝
That is not the way the call home is supposed to go, babe.

426
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:57,625
别跟我开玩笑 说真的 我想让你告诉我一切
Don't be weird with me. Seriously. I want you to tell me everything.

427
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:01,857
呃 有些事情是不能通过电话说的
Well, there's certain things you just can't say over the phone.

428
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,749
听着 是你把我吵醒的 是吧?
Okay, you knocked me up, right?

429
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:06,819
我自己坐在这里组装宝宝床
And I'm sitting here by myself literally assembling baby cribs,

430
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:10,673
可你却什么也不能跟我说? 这就是你的宏大计划?
and you can't talk to me? That's your big plan?

431
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,311
你们在那边基本搞定了吧?
You guys almost done over there yet?

432
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:19,349
我总是不住的想你在蜜月时穿的粉红色小衣服
I can't stop thinking about that little pink number you wore on our honeymoon.

433
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,553
是啊 那叫睡衣
Yeah, it's called a nightgown.

434
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,561
对
Yeah.

435
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,221
而且三天...
And three days...

436
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:31,244
三天不能叫做蜜月
three days is not a honeymoon.

437
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:34,330
那三天非常愉快
Well, it was a good three days.

438
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,753
我真的很想你
I miss you real bad.

439
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:42,639
我也想你
I miss you, too.

440
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:46,292
- 喂 你想我跟你说点下流的话吗?  - 想
- Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?  - Yeah.

441
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:49,305
等等 等等 我得...
Hold on. Hold on a second. Let me just...

442
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:54,901
我... 一手拿着电话一手拿着枪
I got... a phone in one hand and a gun in the other,

443
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,465
我不知道应该做什么
so I don't know what I'm gonna do.

444
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:59,401
那你得决定哪个更重要啊 宝贝
Well, you're gonna have to decide what's more important, baby.

445
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,476
你真是个淫荡的孕妇
Oh, you're a horny preggers.

446
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:06,879
是肥胖又淫荡 太恶心了
Fat and horny. It's fucking disgusting.

447
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:09,666
即使你有三百磅 我还是会爱你
If you were 300 pounds, I'd still do you.

448
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,832
真浪漫
So romantic.

449
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:17,474
- 我的儿子好吗?  - 没人说是个男孩啊
- How's my boy?  - Nobody said it's a boy.

450
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:20,461
我等不及看到你陪他一起玩的场面了
I can't wait to see the way you're gonna be with him.

451
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:22,114
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

452
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:25,899
我就是知道
I just know.

453
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,618
我能感觉到
I can sense it.

454
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:32,173
- 希望你是对的  - 宝贝 我是对的
- I hope you're right.  - Baby, I am right.

455
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,146
- 喂 你爸爸联系你了吗?  - 我还没查邮箱
- Hey, did your dad get ahold of you?  - I haven't checked my e-mails.

456
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:42,209
糟糕! 好 你得挂掉然后再打给他 好不好?
Shit! Okay, you need to hang up and call him, all right?

457
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:45,268
- 为什么? 怎么了?  - 我靠 我真是自私 我竟然都没有想起来
- Why? What's wrong?  - Fuck. I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking.

458
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:48,902
塔雅 怎么了? 发生什么事了?
Taya, what's wrong? What happened?

459
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,709
你弟弟被部署了
Your little brother deployed.

460
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:53,760
你什么意思? 伞兵学校学校那边怎么了?
What do you mean? What happened to jump school?

461
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,897
不 他没进伞兵学校 你先挂掉然后打给你爸爸 好吗?
No, he didn't get in. You just hang up and call your dad, okay?

462
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:00,351
等等 你到底是什么意思? 部署到哪了? 他现在在哪里?
Wait. What do you mean? Deployed where? Where is he?

463
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:02,653
就在你那边
Over there.

464
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,940
他正在去伊拉克的路上
He's headed to Iraq.

465
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,158
我很抱歉 亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey.

466
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,549
这个拿着刀的男人 他是个约旦激进分子
The man with the blade, he's a Jordanian militant.

467
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,185
他由本拉登出资赞助和训练
He's funded by bin Laden. He's trained by bin Laden.

468
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,555
他对本拉登很忠诚
He is loyal to bin Laden.

469
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,225
他的名字叫扎卡维
His name is Zarqawi.

470
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:28,846
现在 这个混蛋是伊拉克境内基地组织的储君
Now, this asshole is right now the crown prince of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

471
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:33,768
他的雇佣军"基地组织"有五千人
His mercenary army, AQI, they're 5,000 strong.

472
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,920
听着 这些可不是你们平时遇到的敌人
Now, these guys are not your average shit-kickers.

473
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,407
这些人受过良好的训练 工资也非常可观
These guys are well trained, they are well paid.

474
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:43,428
现在 他们发起了继越战后最大的城市恐怖袭击
And right now, they are waging the largest urban assault since Vietnam.

475
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:47,965
扎卡维和他的手下们 是我们的首要目标
Zarqawi and his lieutenants, these are our top priority.

476
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:51,086
现在只有一个可以把它们连根拔起的方法
Now, there is only one way to root these guys out,

477
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,222
就是挨家挨户的搜查
and that is to go door to door, house to house,

478
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:58,776
直到我们找到他们或者能够提供关于他们行踪消息的人
until we find them or we find someone who will give us their whereabouts.

479
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:03,282
所以 我们需要每小时清理十个建筑
So, we are going to need to clear 10 structures an hour,

480
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:06,368
我知道任务很重 也很激进
which, I know, is a lot. It's aggressive.

481
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:09,537
但空中援助可以让我们事半功倍
We're gonna be loosening things up with air support.

482
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:13,575
这是我们迄今为止的最首要的目标
This is the highest priority target we have to date.

483
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:18,696
我希望这个混蛋被击毙或者逮捕 明白吗?
I want this asshole dead or captured. Do you understand?

484
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:21,310
有问题吗?
Are there any questions?

485
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:27,089
我敢说 这些海军陆战队要是像现在这样
I'll tell you something. These marines keep rushing in like they're doing,

486
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,757
- 肯定会被敌人干掉的  - 他们是海军陆战队
- they're gonna have their asses shot off.  - Well, they're marines.

487
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:32,826
他们没有像我们一样接受训练 其中一半的人在六个月前都是普通老百姓
They don't get the training we do. Half these guys were civilians six months ago.

488
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:35,563
那就让我们教教他们吧 我会告诉他们团队是如何行动的
Well, let's coach them up. I'll show them how team guys do it.

489
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,566
- 我会带一个小队到街上  - 不 你不能那么做 我们需要你掩护射击
- I'll lead the unit on the street.  - No, can't do that. We need you on overwatch.

490
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,468
拜托 如果我在街上 马克 我可以...
Oh, come on. If I'm on the street, Marc, I could...

491
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:45,342
逐户搜索在这儿可是件要命的活儿 你是有救世主情结吗?
House-to-house is the deadliest job here. You got some sort of savior complex?

492
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:48,244
不 我就是想抓住那些坏家伙 但如果我看不到他们的话 我就没法射杀他们
No, I just want to get the bad guys. But if I can't see them, I can't shoot them.

493
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:51,881
听着 所有这些队员都知道你的大名 如果你在上面掩护的话 他们会觉得自己战无不胜
Look, all these guys, they know your name. And they feel invincible with you up there.

494
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:54,985
- 他们不是这样想的  - 你觉得是就是
- They're not.  - They are if they think they are.

495
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:59,582
你就继续从远处射击吧? 我们会让这些小猎犬把扎卡维嗅出来的
Why don't you keep banging on the long gun? We'll let these dogs sniff out Zarqawi.

496
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:12,266
你说基地组织有一个奥运会的狙击手
You said AQI has a sniper in the Olympics,

497
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:15,220
但是伊拉克在三次运动会中都没有一个合格的射手
but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in three games.

498
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,425
嗯 那是因为穆斯塔法不是伊拉克人
Well, that's 'cause Mustafa's not Iraqi.

499
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,369
他是叙利亚人
He's from Syria.

500
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,052
重新列队!
Regroup!

501
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,623
嘿 一旦你们全部进去 我就什么也看不见了
Hey, once you all gain entry, I can't see shit.

502
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:38,294
所以 慢慢来 从中间穿过你们的作战目标
So take it slow and move through your target.

503
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:41,313
- 明白了  - 爆破!
- Understood.  - Fire in the hole!

504
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:43,650
走 走 走!
Go, go, go!

505
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:02,504
该死的
Fuck this.

506
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:06,190
我要和海军陆战队员们一起扫楼
I'm gonna go clear houses with marines.

507
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,842
- 你来吗?  - 不 我不去
- You coming?  - Fuck no, I'm not coming.

508
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:13,729
不 哥们 我爱生活 我真的很想活着回去
No, man. I like my life. I'd actually like to make it home alive.

509
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,099
听着 我的工作不是去拆毁那些该死的门 对吧?
Look, it's not my job to go fucking knocking down doors, all right?

510
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,970
那些家伙都干错了活儿 我是不会干那傻事的
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I'm not doing that shit.

511
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,173
好吧 嗯 如果我没在底下见到你
All right, well, if I don't see you down there,

512
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:23,941
你最好保证永远都别让我看到你
you make sure I don't see you again.

513
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:33,248
嘿 介意我和你们一起前进吗?
Hey. Y'all mind if I roll with you?

514
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,269
嘿 哥们 我不介意和任何海豹部队成员同行
Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me.

515
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:39,556
你就是他们说的那个传奇人物吧 你射杀了24个人
You're that guy, the one they're calling The Legend. You got like 24 confirmed kills.

516
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:42,758
- 嗯 这是谁数的?  - 那简直太帕
- Well, who's counting?  - That's fucking bad-ass.

517
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,396
是的 我听说有个B队的混蛋已经赶上来了
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker in Bravo's catching up, yo.

518
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:48,065
听着 我知道你们都不是吃素的 可以肯定 但是有一些简单的技巧
Listen. I know y'all are meat-eaters, for sure, but I know a couple things,

519
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,701
我得教教你们 也许可以让我们大家都好好活着 你们觉得怎么样?
some simple shit I could show you. Maybe keep us above ground. What do you say?

520
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,708
- 行  - 好吧

526
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:18,096

Why are you here? You're supposed to be evacuating this area. Why are you still here?

527
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:21,432
- 我是西科・阿尔欧贝帝  - 西科・阿拉什么?! 你到底是谁?!
- I am Sheikh Al-Obeidi.  - Sheik Alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?!

528
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:24,136

- This is my home! I stay!  - I don't give a fuck it's your home!

00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:26,405
- 这是作战区  - 先生 拜托!

00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,648
- 你这儿还有多少人?!  - 但叫那些士兵都进来
- How many more you have here?!  - But tell the soldiers to come in.

534
00:41:36,748 --> 00:41:39,683
不 这个伊斯兰人就是想让我们全部进来这样就可以把我们全都炸死
No. This Hajji just wants us all in here so he can blow us up.

535
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:42,688
- 去检查他的...  - 如果他看到美国人 他就知道我们说话了
- Go check his ass for a...  - If he see American, he know we speak.

- Who? Who? Who saw you talking to us?  - It's very dangerous. Please come in.

539
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:56,233
非常可怕 拜托
Very bad. Please.

540
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,968
- 这个作战目标是安全的吗?  - 是安全的
- This target's secure?  - Target secure.

541
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:01,345
让他们进来 头靠地上 手放背后
Bring them in. Get your head down on the ground. Put your hands behind your back.

542
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,174
现在! 现在进来!
Now! Move now!

543

把他带到另一个房间
Bring him in the other room.

545
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,358
如果他和美国士兵说了话 他们就会过来惩罚他们杀一儆百
If he talks to U.S. soldiers, they will come to his house and make examples of them.

546
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,972
他? 他是谁? 他是谁? 
He? Who's he? Who's he?

547
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,701
来的那个人 他们叫他"屠夫" 他是个丧心病狂的人
The man who comes, they call "The Butcher." He's the despaired one.

548
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:30,970
是撒旦之子 是... 是魔鬼之子
Son of Shaytan, son of... son of devil.

549
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,252
他就像一个执法官?
Oh, he's like an enforcer?

550
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:35,274
是的 执法官
Yes, enforcer.

551
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:37,643
- 头号士兵扎卡维  - 扎卡维?

You know where he is? You tell us where he is right now.

554

我们怎么才能抓到他?
How can we get him?

555
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:47,920
你有关于扎卡维的信息吗? 现在就告诉我们
Do you have information for us about Zarqawi? Tell us right now.

556
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,614
找到屠夫 就能找到扎卡维 他是他的手下
You find the Butcher, you find Zarqawi. He reports to him.

557
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:53,131
好的 我们要怎么找到他?
Okay, well, how do we find him?

558

All right, look at me when I'm talking to you. Where do we find him?

559
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:02,779
我们必须了解的是这样做对他来说是有风险的 但是他会开价的
We must understand the risk to them, but he will ask for money.

560
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:09,006
- 十万美元  - 你要十万美元? 
- $100,000.  - You need $100,000?

561
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:11,939
我没有证据证明有这么个家伙
I have no proof this guy exists.

562
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:14,814
法蒂玛!

All right, look, I wanna help you out. I do. But I need something.

我需要电话号码 地址 名字 你必须给我些信息
I need phone numbers, address, names. You have to give me something.

568
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:39,705
- 长官 第一个排被制约住了  - 我们往外撤!
- Sir. First platoon's pinned down.  - Let's move out!

569
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:43,643
西科 我跟你说话的时候请看着我 嘿! 看着我! 我需要一些信息
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you. Hey! Look at me! I need something.

570

我可以帮你 西科
I can help you out, Sheikh.

571
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:48,281
你告诉我他的名字 我们会小心的
You give me a name, and we will take care of it.

572
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,383
我可以向你保证 我们会保证你们的安全
I can promise you that. We will give you safety.

573
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:54,169
- 现在就告诉我们!  - 阿米尔・卡拉夫・法纳斯!
- Tell me right now!  - Amir Khalaf Fanus!

574
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:56,056
- 埃米尔・阿纳发努斯?  - 阿米尔・卡拉夫・法纳斯
- Emile Anafanoos?  - Amir Khalaf Fanus.

575
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:58,441
这是屠夫的名字
This is the given name of the Butcher.

576
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,845
我们相信屠夫是扎卡维手下的二把手
We believe that the Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man.

577
00:44:02,195 --> 00:44:03,729
这就是你们要找的家伙
This is your guy right here.

578
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,331
是 但你不知道他的真名 不然你就会把它写上去了
Yeah, but you don't know his real name. Otherwise, you'd have written it up there.

579
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,653
我们知道很多别名
We got several aliases.

580
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:13,172
现在 如果"法纳斯"是真名...
Now, if "Fanus" is legit...

581
00:44:13,272 --> 00:44:17,676
- 我们要... 我们要去见这个西科  - 他开口要十万
- We'll... we'll go see the Sheikh.  - He's asking for 100,000.

582
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:21,180
数字 但是如果他能把屠夫交出来 那就给他这么多吧
Figures. But if he delivers the Butcher, he's gonna get it.

583
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,918
我是国防情报局的斯尼德探员 我要查一下阿米尔・卡拉夫・法纳斯这个名字
This is agent Snead, DIA. I need a name check on an Amir Khalaf Fanus.

584
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:28,855
好的 我等着
Yeah, I'll wait.

585
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:31,357
如果我们回去的话 第三组可以做安保工作
If we're gonna go back out there, team 3 can pull security.

586
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:34,710
那是不可能的 如果我们要动钱的话 上头就会派人过来了
That's not gonna happen. Head shed's gonna want contractors on it if we're humping money.

587
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,749
是的 我还在 你查到了什么?
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

588
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,786
好吧 行
All right. Okay.

589
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:47,502
我们去见西科吧
Let's go see the Sheikh.

590
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,325
路杀
Roadkill.

591
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:07,960
你知道屠夫是扎卡维的执法官吗?
You know the Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer?

592
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,547
他们说他的武器竟然是把该死的电钻
They say his weapon of choice is a fucking drill.

593
00:45:11,997 --> 00:45:15,586
我在加入海军之前上过神学院
Went to seminary school before I joined the Navy.

594
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:18,172
差点就成了牧师
Was close to being a preacher.

595
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:20,889
那最后为什么没当成?
And why didn't you?

596
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:23,811
哥们 我喜欢赌博
I love to gamble, man.

597
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,228
喜欢那些骰子
Love those dice.

598
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:27,857
真是我喜欢的好牧师
That's my kind of preacher.

599
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:45,404
现在竟然有电话了?
It's like that now?

600
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:48,585
你没听说过吗? 我就是"传奇"
Oh, haven't you heard? I'm The Legend.

601
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:50,020
嘿 宝贝
Hey, babe.

602
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,190
你说对了 医生说是个男孩
You were right. The doctor says it's a boy.

603
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,624

拿上钱! 去目标地点!
Grab the money! Get to the drop!

609

Go! Go! Get the fuck outta here! We'll come back for them.

612
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,065

613
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:52,065
- 我听到了一声枪响  - 对
- I heard one shot.  - Check.

614

子弹弯了个角度 射手在300码或者更远的位置
Came in at an angle. Be 300 or more yards out.

615
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:57,192
天啊
Oh, my God.

616
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:03,790
- 你瞄准他了吗?  - 机会不大
- You got a bead on him?  - I got a tiny little window.

617
00:47:05,766 --> 00:47:10,528
该死! 我看见屠夫了 他把西科的小孩弄到大街上了
Shit! I got eyes on the Butcher. He's got the Sheikh's kid on the avenue.

618
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:19,026
请求快速反应部队支援
Requesting QRF.

619
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:22,631
我们在接近高级作战目标的时候被狙击手的射击制约住了
We're being pinned down by sniper fire on approach of high value target.

620
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:26,543
坐标04536236 完毕
Grid 04536236. Over.

621
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,504
我想给他们放个烟雾弹保证这座楼的安全 我要去屋顶
I wanna pop a smoke 'em and secure this building. I'm going to the roof.

622
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:36,101
等等!
Hold up!

623
00:47:41,117 --> 00:47:43,353
- 等等  - 再等等

624
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,609
走!
Go!

625
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:55,279
天啊 天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

626
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,850
你跟他们通风报信 就和他们一起死

627
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:45,742
来吧 你这该死的混蛋!
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch!

628
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,768
去死!
Fuck you!
621 

629
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:59,974
天啊 简直一团糟
Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess.

630
00:50:00,524 --> 00:50:04,019
你就是个愚蠢的混蛋 你知道吗? 你究竟在想什么?
You're one dumb son of a bitch, you know that? What the hell were you thinking?

631
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,297
你完全没有保护好战场
You completely failed to secure the battlefield.

632
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:10,101
我要把这次任务全部暂停直到调查结束为止 回基地去吧!
I'm shutting this whole thing down pending an inquiry. Get back to base!

633
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:14,371
- 嘿 我们得组一支队伍去追他  - 不行 他们让我们停工
- Hey, we gotta set up a squad and pursue him.  - Nope, they're shutting us down.

634
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,705
什么意思?
What do you mean?

635
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,909
他们搞清楚是怎么回事之后我们才能再出来 
Can't leave the wire till they figure this shit out.

636
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:23,471
他不能就那样把我们晾在这儿 嘿! 我还有三周就要回家了!
Well, he can't just leave us like that. Hey! I go home in three weeks!

637
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:27,080
哥们 那将会是漫长的三周
Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks.

638
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:07,511
- 你好吗?  - 最近怎么样 老爸?
- How are you?  - What's going on, pop?

639
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:15,887
嘿
Hey.

640
00:51:19,737 --> 00:51:21,681
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

641
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,009
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

642
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:27,563
对不起 我很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

643
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:31,066
- 我还以为你死了  - 嗯 我不就在这儿嘛
- I thought you were dead.  - Well, I'm right here.

644
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:37,026
看着我
Look at me.

645
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:41,944
- 你没事吧?  - 没事
- You all right?  - Yeah.

646
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,883
你是我见过的最美的风景
You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

647
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:08,052
我的身体里长着个外星人
I have an alien growing inside me.

648
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:14,252
- 有个陌生的男人在我的卧室里  - 嗯 是我们的卧室
- And there's a strange man in my bedroom.  - Well, it's our bedroom.

649
00:52:18,063 --> 00:52:20,020
你的手感觉不一样了
Your hands feel different.

650
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,355
没有 我的手... 我的手就是这样的啊
Oh, no. They're... they're my hands.

651
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,705
- 该死的我为什么这么紧张?  - 嗯 我也是
- Why am I so fucking nervous?  - Well, I am, too.

652
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:32,411
- 不 你才没有 你在说谎  - 不 真的紧张 我发誓
- No, you're not. You're lying.  - Yes, I am. I swear.

653
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:36,015
我怎么知道那里的外星人不会出来抓住我?
How do I know some alien in there is not gonna come out and grab me?

654
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:37,883
在半夜的时候
In the middle of the night.

655
00:52:37,983 --> 00:52:40,143
那我就不得不...
Then I'm gonna have to...

656
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:43,546
哽咽着让他出来
choke him out.

657
00:52:46,825 --> 00:52:48,027
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

658
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:50,766
- 你保证?  - 是的 当然
- Promise?  - Yeah, of course.

659
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:55,725
你为什么对我这么好?
Why're you so good with me?

660
00:53:02,908 --> 00:53:05,894
嘿 宝贝 出去走走会比较好
Hey, babe. It might be nice to get out.

661
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:08,065
你在听我说话吗?
You listening to me?

662
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:10,632
克里斯
Chris.

663
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,737
亲爱的 你今天打算干什么?
What do you wanna do today, hon?

664
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:21,109
我想我们就在家里休息吧
I thought we could just relax here.

665
00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:25,950
好的 就按你说的做
Okay, we do that.

666
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,414
让我们休息一下
Let's relax.

667
00:53:30,122 --> 00:53:33,172
- 你在干什么?  - 把脚放你身上啊
- What're you doing?  - Putting my foot on you.

668
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:36,622
嗯 你知道 那是... 那地方通到我的心脏
Well, you know that's... that's the way to my heart.

669
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:40,472
我过来咯
I'm coming over.

670
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,292
看起来很棒
And that looks great.

671
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:53,720
看 他在摸自己的鼻子
Look. He's touching his nose.

672
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,976
- 你感觉如何?  - 感觉还行 想让他出来 我觉得很疲惫 
- How are you feeling?  - I'm all right. I just want him out. I'm tired.

673
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:59,766
- 嗯 可能是从现在开始的任何一天  - 希望如此
- Well, it's gonna be any day now.  - I hope so.

674
00:53:59,866 --> 00:54:01,969
你呢 凯尔先生? 感觉如何?
How 'bout you, Mr. Kyle? How're you feeling?

675
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:03,703
我感觉挺好的 谢谢你 夫人
I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am.

676
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:06,722
我想减压会挺难的
I imagine it's hard to decompress.

677
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:09,275
真的不会 不会
Not really. No.

678
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,878
这是我们头一回出家门
This is the first time we've left the house.

679
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,401
回家我很开心 嗯
I'm happy to be home. Yeah.

680
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:20,370
来 把这个系上 好吗?
Here, put this on for me, would ya?

681
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:23,525
我想如果你想做些检查的话 检查我的膝盖会比较合适
I think if you wanna check anything out, you may wanna check out these knees.

682
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:25,654
- 你抽烟吗?  - 不抽 夫人
- Are you a smoker?  - No, ma'am.

683
00:54:25,754 --> 00:54:28,545
- 你喝酒吗?  - 只在口渴的时候喝
- You drink?  - Only when I'm thirsty.

684
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:37,270
高压170低压110
That's 170/110.

685
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,774
- 天啊 克里斯  - 这算很高吗?
- Jesus Christ, Chris.  - Is that high?

686
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:44,578
如果你刚喝完14杯咖啡的话那就不算高 但是你现在正好好地坐着...
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee. But for someone who is sitting down...

687
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:48,504
谢谢你... 帮我检查 我会再去检查的
Oh, I appreciate you... taking a look at that. I'll look into it.

688
00:54:48,604 --> 00:54:51,019
- 谢谢  - 你会去检查吗?
- Thank you.  - Will you look into it?

689
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,706
是的 
Yeah.

690
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:55,823
你刚刚在那儿是在给我捣乱
You sabotaged me back there.

691
00:54:55,923 --> 00:54:59,128
那我应该怎么做? 你一直不说话 表现出一幅一切都很好的样子
What am I supposed to do? You're not talking. You act like it's all okay.

692
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:01,764
- 没事的 我很好  - 克里斯 你出了问题 好吗?
- It is okay. I'm fine.  - You're not fine, Chris, all right?

693
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:05,547
你的血压都高压170低压110了 这简直...  
Your blood pressure is, like, fucking 170/110. It's like...

694
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:09,178
我正在高速路上开车 现在阳光灿烂 温度72度
I'm driving down the freeway. It's sunny. It's 72 degrees.

695
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:11,606
我很好 有一场战争正在进行 有人正在死去
I'm fine. There's a war going on. There's people dying.

696
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,842
没有人谈起它 就像它甚至没在进行一样
No one's even talking about that. It's like it's not even happening.

697
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:18,067
我们都在打电话 过着我们简单又单纯的生活
We're all on our cell phones, living our simple, simplistic lives.

698
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,015
- 新闻甚至都没有报道 没有人在意  - 克里斯
- It's not even on the news. No one cares.  - Chris.

699
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:22,845
战争正在进行着但我却在去商场的路上
There's a war going on and I'm headed to the mall.

700
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,327
- 克里斯 我要生了  - 我不应该在这儿
- Chris. It's happening.  - I'm not supposed to be here.

701

- 怎么了? 你还好吗?  - 我要生了
- What's wrong? You okay?  - It's happening.

- 你真是疯了! 你知道吗?  - 没事的 嘿 宝贝 宝贝
- You're fucking crazy! You know that?  - It's okay. Hey! Baby, baby.

00:55:37,865 --> 00:55:42,119
- 天啊 宝贝  - 你看起来真美
- Oh, my God. Baby.  - You look beautiful.

705
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:44,856
竟然要生了
It's fucking happening.

706
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:49,497
我的孩子
Oh, my baby.

707
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:54,558
快看你的妈妈

Hey, little guy. Look what we did.

711
00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:08,397
我们真是好样的 瞧瞧我们的结晶

瞧瞧我们的结晶
Look what we made.

713
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,880
宝贝在哭 我以为你会去哄他
The baby's crying. I thought you were gonna get him.

714
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,900
不 不用关掉 我已经看到了
No, don't bother turning it off. I already watched it.

715
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,987
我得确保你没有伊拉克女朋友给你发来性感视频
Had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending you sexy videos.

716
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,179
那是个录下自己射杀过程的狙击手 他叫穆斯塔法
That's a sniper recording his kills. That's Mustafa.

717
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,022
他把那鬼东西拿出来卖 那些都是美国士兵
He sells that shit on the street. Those are American soldiers.

718
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:42,113
我们打电话的那天 是他吗? 是吗?
That day that we were on the phone, was that him? Was it?

719
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,269
克里斯 说说吧 你这种什么都不说的方式是没法保护到我的
Chris, just talk about it. You're not protecting me by not talking about it.

720
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:49,137
不 我不希望你的头脑里出现那些画面 你知道吗?
No, I don't want you getting that in your head, ya understand?

721
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:51,974
我想象中的画面比你可能告诉我的还要糟
Well, my imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me.

722
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,271
- 克里斯  - 宝贝 他们就是群该死的野蛮人
- Chris.  - Babe, They're fucking savages.

723
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:55,804
和他们没关系
It's not about them.

724
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,132
这关系到我们自己
It's about us.

725
00:57:00,324 --> 00:57:01,232
什么?
What?

726
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:09,246
你必须要回到我们身边
You have to make it back to us.

727
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,324
懂吗?
Okay?

728
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,724

You're my hero, bro. Okay? You always have been.

We were stuck in a house until you came in with the 1st marines.

897
01:13:21,543 --> 01:13:24,064
是您把我背了出来
You were the one that carried me out.

898
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:26,414
海军陆战队救了我们的小命不止一次呢

是从什么时候开始的?
When does that start?

938
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:18,205
就算你人在这的时候 你的心也不在这
Even when you're here, you're not here.

939

You're the father of my children, but they're the ones that pull you back.

945
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:03,355

Yeah, but, you see, they... they can't wait, and we can.

946
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:11,729
如果你认为这场战争并没有改变你 那么你就大错特错了
If you think this war isn't changing you, you're wrong.

947
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:18,376
你只活在战火中
You can only circle the flame so long.

你太虚伪了
That's just hypocritical.

962
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:16,208
慢点 别 别靠太近
Hey, ease up on that. No, don't get too close.

什么对不起? 我们去屋顶都怪我
For what? What are you sorry for? It's my fault we went on that roof.

1010
01:22:40,742 --> 01:22:42,244
我会死吗?
Am I gonna die?

1011
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:46,181
当然不会 比格斯 你是蛙人 蛙人从来不会死
Fuck no, Biggles. You're a fucking frogman. Frogmen don't fucking die.

1012
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:49,584
在伤口里放点沙子 再给你一水壶的水
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut. We'll get you a fucking canteen of water.

You're gonna be fucking fine, Biggles. Hang in there.

1014
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:54,442

1015
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:56,305
当然

1016
01:23:00,529 --> 01:23:03,382
减弱吸力 把牵开器递给我
All right, let's decrease suction. The retractor, please.

1017
01:23:03,832 --> 01:23:06,203

Type and cross. I need those numbers now.

1022
01:23:26,866 --> 01:23:28,541
你看到子弹是从哪来的了吗?
Did you see where it came from?

1023
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:32,094
一千多米开外
Yeah, it was more than 1,000 meters out.

1024
01:23:32,194 --> 01:23:34,549
敌方只有一个狙击手能打中这一枪
Only one enemy sniper coulda made that shot.

1025
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:37,420
他能撑下来吗?
Will he make it?

1026
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,603
鬼门关走了一遭 血压一度降到了48
Took a round off the feed tray cover. Was 48.

1027
01:23:40,703 --> 01:23:42,604
不太乐观
Doesn't look good.

1028
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,842
这是第一个受伤的海豹突击队员 长官
That's the first SEAL hit, sir.

1029
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:46,859
操!
Fuck!

1030
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:51,580
有个司机是我们的线人 他说七座建筑之外有一个大本营
Shi'a cab driver we source is saying there's a stronghold seven doors down.

1031
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,366
海军陆战队依然能掩护你们
Marine units covered your exfil are still engaged there.

1032
01:23:54,725 --> 01:23:59,538
是继续还是退出你们自己定 我能理解
I can understand if you want to stand down and regroup. It's up to you.

1033
01:23:59,889 --> 01:24:02,295
以牙还牙
Lex talionis.

1034
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:04,533
以眼还眼
Eye for an eye.

1035
01:24:09,264 --> 01:24:11,380
我们杀回去
We're going back out.

1036

安全
All clear.

1048
01:25:48,631 --> 01:25:51,619
马克 看来离开的人很着急
Hey, Marc. Looks like someone left in a hurry.

1049
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:00,545
- 有人受伤!  - 守好窗户!
- Man down!  - Cover the window!

1050
01:26:00,645 --> 01:26:02,462
有人受伤!
Man down!

1051
01:26:02,712 --> 01:26:05,208
- 看好窗户!  - 看好窗户!
- Cut that window!  - Cut that window!

1052
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,647
坚持住 马克
Come on, Marc.

1053
01:26:19,297 --> 01:26:23,553
我们走 我在这 看着我 快看着我
Let's go, buddy. I got you, man. I got you. Look at me. Look at me.

1054
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:26,889
有我在
I got you.

1055
01:26:35,969 --> 01:26:37,267
哥们 马克死了
Marc's gone, bro.

1056
01:26:39,717 --> 01:26:42,953
一名海豹突击队员伤亡 尽快派辆车
I got one SEAL down. I need cabs back immediately.

1057
01:26:43,053 --> 01:26:45,173
我们要把他带回去
We gotta fucking move him.

1058
01:26:53,586 --> 01:26:56,714
"有些人追求荣耀
"Glory is something some men chase,

1059
01:26:56,814 --> 01:26:59,705
而另一些人却因此误入歧途
and others find themselves stumbling upon

1060
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:02,440
自己却毫无察觉
not expecting to find it.

1061
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,177
无论如何 一个人找到自己存在的价值
Either way, it is a noble gesture that one...

1062
01:27:05,327 --> 01:27:07,246
都是一件高尚的事
finds bestowed upon them.

1063
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:13,334
我想问的是 荣耀是何时腐朽发霉而变成一场十字军东征的?
My question is, when does glory fade away and become a wrongful crusade?

1064
01:27:13,484 --> 01:27:17,963
又或者是能将人消耗殆尽的
Or an unjustified means by which consumes one...

1065
01:27:18,063 --> 01:27:20,895
自私手段?
completely? I've...

1066
01:27:21,494 --> 01:27:24,162
我亲历战争...
seen war...

1067
01:27:24,262 --> 01:27:28,134
我也曾见证... 死亡"
and I've seen... death."

1068
01:27:28,234 --> 01:27:30,586
全体都有 立正!
Detail. Ten-hut!

1069
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,622
举枪!
Port arms!

举枪致敬!
Present arms!

1079
01:28:47,012 --> 01:28:50,001
那封信是马克两周前写的
Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago.

1080
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:54,904
他跟你说过什么吗?
Did he say any of that to you?

1081
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:06,083
克里斯 我想知道你怎么看那封信
Chris, I wanna know what you thought of his letter.

1082
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:12,455
基地组织的线人发来了线报 然后... 比格斯就中了弹
An AQI informant had called in a tip, and... Biggles had just been shot.

1083
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:16,543
我们当时在执行任务 然后就遇到了埋伏
We were operating out of emotion, and we just walked right into an ambush.

1084
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,862
可他的死和这些没有关系
But that's not what killed him.

1085
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:22,882
是那封信 是那封信杀了马克
That letter did. That letter killed Marc.

1086
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:27,633
他... 他放松了 也为此付出了代价
He just... he let go, and he paid the price for it.

1087
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:40,461
在这签字吗?
Sign in here?

1088

- 你瞎得跟个蝙蝠似的  - 是啊 胀死了
- Shit, you're blind as a bat. - Yeah, it fucking blows.

1092
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:04,326
- 不过他们说我这脸能修好  - 谢天谢地
- They say they're gonna fix my face, though.  - Oh, thank God.

1093
01:30:04,426 --> 01:30:07,995
- 是时候了 你这脸真该修修了  - 太早了 哥们
- About time. Your face needs some fixing.  - It's too soon, man.

1094
01:30:08,095 --> 01:30:10,431
- 这还早?  - 太早了
- It is too soon?  - Way too soon.

1095
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:13,434
- 我听说你求婚了  - 是啊
- Hey, I heard you proposed.  - Yeah.

1096
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:17,171
太好了 那个钻石你没说是...
Well, good for you. You didn't tell her you bought that diamond...

1097
01:30:17,271 --> 01:30:19,483
- 你说是在Zales买的吧?  - 不是
- you told her you bought it at Zales, right?  - No.

1098
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:23,010
- 没说?  - 不是不是 买了个新的
- You didn't?  - No. No, got a new one.

1099
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,179
这个比较小 她爸帮了我一把
It's a smaller one. Her dad helped me out with it.

1100
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:26,347
- 好事啊  - 是啊
- Oh, nice.  - Yeah.

1101
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:28,383
真好
Oh, good.

1102
01:30:28,483 --> 01:30:30,403
她不愿意离开我
She wouldn't leave me, bro.

1103
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:35,038
我让她走 可她就是不离开我
I told her to go, and she wouldn't leave.

1104
01:30:35,991 --> 01:30:38,909
对她太不公平了
She's getting a raw fucking deal.

1105
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,704
干嘛这么说? 别这样 她还有你
Why would you say that? Don't say that. She's got you.

1106
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:49,526
- 你那五厘米都是她的  - 五厘米
- All two inches of you.  - Two inches.

1107
01:30:50,438 --> 01:30:53,908
跟你说 我很庆幸出事的是我不是你
Yeah, you know, I'm glad this happened to me and not you.

1108
01:30:54,008 --> 01:30:57,694
- 你肯定受不了  - 也许你说得对
- Ain't no way you coulda handled it.  - Yeah, you're probably right.

1109
01:30:58,274 --> 01:31:01,617
他们说你是美国军队历史上最致命的狙击手
So they say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history.

1110
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:04,671
- 是吗  - 我听说是
- Oh, is that right?  - That's what I heard.

1111
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:09,858
- 那群货回到了萨德尔市  - 别去了
- The bad guys ended up in Sadr City.  - You're not going back.

1112
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:11,826
要去 我们要把他们赶尽杀绝
Yeah, we are. We're gonna wall 'em in and hunt 'em down.

1113
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:13,527
算了吧 哥们 没必要这样的
Nah, come on, man. You don't have to do that.

1114
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:16,766
必须这样 你是我的兄弟
Oh, we have to do that. You're my brother.

1115
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:19,793
他们要为对你的所作所为付出代价
And they're gonna fucking pay for what they did to you.

1116
01:31:21,535 --> 01:31:24,171
好啊 传奇
Hooyah, Legend.

1117

太好了
Fucking hooyah.

1118
01:31:31,746 --> 01:31:36,518
如果我出事了 别管我
Something happens to me, you'd be all right.

1119
01:31:36,618 --> 01:31:39,473
去找别人
You'd find someone else.

1120
01:31:41,423 --> 01:31:43,892
你想死吗?
Do you wanna die?

1121
01:31:43,992 --> 01:31:45,992
就这样是吗?
Is that what it is?

1122
01:31:46,092 --> 01:31:47,814
不想
No.

1123
01:31:48,364 --> 01:31:50,215
那告诉我
Then just tell me.

1124
01:31:51,365 --> 01:31:52,802
告诉我为什么要这样
Tell me why you do it.

1125
01:31:52,902 --> 01:31:54,437
- 不是  - 我想知道
- Oh, come on.  - I wanna understand.

1126
01:31:54,537 --> 01:31:56,906
亲爱的 我是为了你 这都是为了保护你
Babe, I do it for you. You know that. I do it to protect you.

1127
01:31:57,006 --> 01:31:59,274
- 你并没有  - 我确实是
- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

1128

- Well, I have to serve my country.  - That is such fucking bullshit!

1131
01:32:07,316 --> 01:32:10,897
- 不是扯淡  - 你不知道什么时候该脱身
- No, it's not.  - You don't know when to quit.

1132
01:32:11,486 --> 01:32:15,291
你做了分内的事 我们的牺牲足够多了 你得让别人去
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough. You let somebody else go.

1133
01:32:15,391 --> 01:32:17,226
- 让别人去?  - 对
- Let somebody else go?  - Yeah.

1134
01:32:17,326 --> 01:32:20,595
- 我接受不了  - 那就找个法子接受
- I couldn't live with myself.  - Yeah, well, you find a way.

你回来的时候 也许我们就不在了
I don't think we'll be here when you get back.

1141

Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.

- This shit is fucking biblical, Chris.  - Is there any other punishers here?

1147
01:33:26,495 --> 01:33:30,599
松鼠走了 道博倒是想回来 但他老婆不同意
Squirrel cycled out. And Dauber was coming back, but his wife knocked him up.

And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll murder my motherfucking ass, Chris.

- Teams and shit, right?  - Teams and shit.

1150
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:38,242
比格斯的事真是个打击
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man.

1151

走之前我还去医院看他了 他啥也看不见
I went to see him in the hospital before I left. Motherfucker can't see shit.

1152
01:33:43,013 --> 01:33:44,668
比格斯死了 克里斯

听好了 上头坚信如果能把基地的残兵堵在丁字墙这里
All right, listen up. The head-shed believe this T-wall here will help win the war

1164
01:36:29,037 --> 01:36:31,485
战争就快结束了
by trapping remaining AQI behind it.

1165
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:33,701
问题是墙后很深的地方能藏一个狙击手
Problem is the engineers building the goddamn things

1166
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:36,855

are getting picked off by one single sniper from deep behind the wall.

1167
01:36:36,955 --> 01:36:38,664
能藏多深?

He can be whoever the fuck you need him to be. We just need him dead.

We'll shuttle you six blocks north into enemy territory,

1173
01:36:50,802 --> 01:36:53,607
他开枪时 你们就在他鼻子底下
which will put you right up under the sniper's nose when he takes his shot, okay?

1174
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:57,143
- 在沙尘暴中心?  - 把你的护目镜带上 斑比
- In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?  - Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi.

1187
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:25,163
欢迎变成沙人
Enter the fucking sandman.

1188
01:41:04,527 --> 01:41:06,149
- 有人受伤!  - 全体退后!
- Man down!  - Man back!

1189
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:11,056

枪声是从东边来的!
Shot came from the east!

1191
01:41:19,141 --> 01:41:22,123
我们搞错方向了
We set up in the wrong fucking direction.

1192
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:26,739
不管他 别开枪 这些敌人就在下面
Doesn't matter. Hold your fire. We got uglies right below us.

1193

Fuck, you can't even see that far out. Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.

1195
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,325
他说得对 传奇 不好

- And I took him out.  - Yeah. Now we're fucked like a football bat.

1214

01:49:19,426 --> 01:49:22,383
我看着外面 听着我的口令 冲向西边的电线杆!
I got the out. Green-side pole on my go!

1256
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:27,036
他们在屋顶上
They're on the roof.

1257
01:49:27,335 --> 01:49:28,463
我们走!
Let's go!

1258
01:49:47,156 --> 01:49:48,511
最后一个人!
Last man!

1259
01:50:07,777 --> 01:50:09,341
到后面来!
Get to the back!

1260
01:50:21,191 --> 01:50:22,725
走! 走! 走!
Go! Go! Go!

1261
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:24,360
快来! 里面来 里面来!
Come on! Inside, inside!

1262
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:27,011
到车子里来! 到车子里来! 我们得走了!
Get in the truck! Get in the truck now! We got to go!

1263
01:50:40,075 --> 01:50:42,245
来吧! 我们得走了!
Come on! We got to get out now!

1264
01:50:42,345 --> 01:50:44,097
把我拉上来
Let me up.

1265
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:46,800
快点 把我拉上来 快点
Come on, let me up. Come on.

1266
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:50,387
克里斯在哪里?
Where's Chris?

1267
01:50:50,487 --> 01:50:52,726
他刚刚还在我后面呢 克里斯呢?
He was just behind me. Where is Chris, man?

1268
01:50:55,124 --> 01:50:56,476
他妈的把门打开
Open the fucking door.

1269
01:51:01,231 --> 01:51:02,463
快他妈停车!
Stop the goddamn rig!

1270
01:51:06,001 --> 01:51:07,537
他在哪?! 克里斯!
Where is he?! Chris!

1271
01:51:07,637 --> 01:51:08,949
克里斯 快来!
Chris, come on!

1272
01:51:09,572 --> 01:51:12,444
- 快来!  - 他妈的停车啊 哥们!
- Come on!  - Hold the fucking vehicle, man!

1273
01:51:12,544 --> 01:51:16,296
我们不会离开你的! 来吧 克里斯! 抓住我的手! 快上来 克里斯!
We can't leave you! Come on, Chris! Grab my hand! Come on, Chris!

1274
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:18,398
把他拉进来!
Pull him in now!

1275
01:51:22,959 --> 01:51:24,972
来吧 克里斯!
Come on, Chris!

1276
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,596
- 嗯?  - 嘿 是我
- Yeah?  - Hey, it's me.

1277
01:52:37,696 --> 01:52:41,583
我... 我收到消息说你在飞机上什么的
I just... I got this weird message that you were on a plane or something?

1278
01:52:41,933 --> 01:52:44,435
是啊 是啊 我提早出来了
Yeah. Yeah, I got out early.

1279
01:52:44,535 --> 01:52:46,605
是吗?
You did?

1280
01:52:46,705 --> 01:52:48,807
那你现在在德国 还是... 你在哪?
So, what, are you in Germany, or... where?

1281
01:52:48,907 --> 01:52:51,512
不 我在这里 我...
No, I'm here. I'm...

1282
01:52:53,344 --> 01:52:54,862
我在国内
I'm stateside.

1283
01:52:55,812 --> 01:52:57,766
你回家了?
You're home?

1284
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:00,969
你... 你在干什么?
What... what are you doing?

1285
01:53:04,989 --> 01:53:07,843
我想我还需要一点时间
I guess I just needed a minute.

1286
01:53:09,793 --> 01:53:15,426
克里斯 孩... 孩子们都很想见你 已经九个月了
Chris, the... the kids are dying to see you. It's been nine months.

1287
01:53:22,907 --> 01:53:25,343
我要回家了
I'm coming home.

1288
01:53:25,443 --> 01:53:27,661
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

1289
01:53:27,911 --> 01:53:30,006
嗯 我很好
Yeah, I'm good.

1290
01:53:33,053 --> 01:53:35,831
宝贝 回家好吗?
Babe, come home. Okay?

1291
01:53:35,931 --> 01:53:38,722
其实 我们... 我们很想你
You know, we... we miss you.

1292
01:53:41,694 --> 01:53:43,820
好的
Okay.

1293
01:54:23,875 --> 01:54:25,055
嘿 克里斯?
Hey, Chris?

1294
01:54:25,705 --> 01:54:27,605
宝贝
Babe.

1295
01:54:34,379 --> 01:54:37,102
宝贝 我... 我出去了
Hon, I'm... I'm going outside.

1296
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:46,676
- 好的  - 高点
- Get it.  - Higher.

1297
01:54:47,326 --> 01:54:50,974
看看你 我又能见到你的脸了 宝贝 样子不错
Look at you. I can see your face again, babe. Looks good.

1298
01:54:51,225 --> 01:54:53,717
- 好的  - 看上去不一样了
- Oh, good.  - Looks different.

1299
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,017
比赛是这个礼拜六
So the game's this Saturday.

1300
01:54:57,117 --> 01:55:01,007
他是队里最高的孩子 医生说他能长到六尺四
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team. Doctor said he could be 6'4".

1301
01:55:01,107 --> 01:55:03,092
真是疯了 对吧?
Isn't that insane?

1302
01:55:03,937 --> 01:55:05,848
我等不及让你看他比赛了 不过当其他小孩跳到他身上的时候
I can't wait for you to see him play. I go so crazy, though,

1303
01:55:05,948 --> 01:55:08,381
我都会疯掉 我需要你在那里 安抚我
when the other kids jump on him. Like, I need you there as, like, a leveler,

1304
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:10,478
你懂吗?
you know what I mean?

1305
01:55:11,018 --> 01:55:13,969
嘿 也许你还可以当教练呢?
Hey, maybe you could even coach, you know?

1306
01:55:16,489 --> 01:55:19,092
肯娜快要掉牙了 我真怕她会把那颗牙吞下去
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth, and I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it,

1307
01:55:19,192 --> 01:55:23,530
比如在她睡觉的时候什么的 她说她只允许你来拔它
like, in her sleep or something. And she said she'd let you pull it, but only you.

1308
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:25,449
你行吗?
Would you do that?

1309
01:55:42,882 --> 01:55:44,292
克里斯!
Chris!

1310
01:55:58,966 --> 01:56:02,253
我接到了个很有趣的电话 是你的妻子打来的
I got a very interesting phone call. It's from your wife.

1311
01:56:02,603 --> 01:56:04,621
她和我说了烧烤的时候发生的事了
She told me about the barbecue.

1312
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:08,008
是啊 那事不太好
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah.

1313
01:56:08,108 --> 01:56:10,145
事情似乎有点失控了
Things seem like they got a little out of hand.

1314
01:56:10,245 --> 01:56:12,980
- 你担心吗?  - 不担心 先生
- Are you worried?  - No, sir.

1315
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,468
你不担心那天发生的事 也不担心可能发生的事?
So you're not worried about what happened, or what might happen?

1316
01:56:16,618 --> 01:56:18,644
不担心 先生 我不担心
No, sir, I'm not worried about that.

1317
01:56:20,287 --> 01:56:22,590
让我问你一个问题 克里斯
Let me ask you a question, Chris.

1318
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:25,529
你在战场上待了多少时间?
How much time did you spend in-country?

1319
01:56:25,629 --> 01:56:29,864
- 呃 四次部署 所以...  - 差不多有一千天?
- Well, four tours, so...  - That's like, what, 1,000 days?

1320
01:56:29,964 --> 01:56:32,116
是啊 差不多
Yeah, sounds about right.

1321
01:56:32,466 --> 01:56:34,058
如果我告诉你 海军说你
Would you be surprised if I told you

1322
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:39,276
杀了160个人 你会吃惊吗?
that the Navy has credited you with over 160 kills?

1323
01:56:40,373 --> 01:56:42,487
你有没有想过...
Do you ever think that...

1324
01:56:42,587 --> 01:56:47,063
你可能见过 或者做过一些让你后悔的事?
you might have seen things or done some things over there that you wish you hadn't?

1325
01:56:47,313 --> 01:56:49,666
我不会这样的 不会
Oh, that's not me. No.

1326
01:56:50,316 --> 01:56:52,719
- 不会怎么样?  - 我只是在保护我的人
- What's not you?  - I was just protecting my guys.

1327
01:56:52,819 --> 01:56:55,536
他们想杀我们的士兵 但是...
They were trying to kill our soldiers, and...

1328
01:56:55,636 --> 01:56:59,802
我见到我的造物主的时候 我愿意面对我开的每一枪
I'm willing to meet my creator and answer for every shot that I took.

1329
01:57:02,396 --> 01:57:04,752
我不能...
The thing that...

1330
01:57:05,099 --> 01:57:08,320
我不能释怀的是那些我没能救的人
haunts me are all the guys that I couldn't save.

1331
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:14,348
其实 我愿意也可以在那里 但是我不在那里 我在这里 我放弃了
You know, I'm willing and able to be there, but I'm not. I'm here. I quit.

1332
01:57:16,143 --> 01:57:18,146
所以你希望能救更多的人?
So you wish you could've saved more guys?

1333
01:57:19,581 --> 01:57:20,967
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1334
01:57:22,617 --> 01:57:26,154
其实 你可以在这个医院的走廊里走走
You know, you can walk down any hall in this hospital.

1335
01:57:26,254 --> 01:57:28,610
这里有很多需要拯救的士兵
We got plenty of soldiers need saving.

1336
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:36,098
想走一走吗?
Wanna take a walk?

1337
01:57:36,198 --> 01:57:37,910
当然
Sure.

1338
01:57:38,199 --> 01:57:41,541
好吧 我要给你看一个东西
All right. I wanna show you something.

1339
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:45,661
我还在抽烟
I still smoke.

1340
01:57:45,761 --> 01:57:49,678
我生不了什么气 因为抽烟救了我的右手
Can't be too mad at it 'cause it kinda saved my right hand.

1341
01:57:49,778 --> 01:57:51,412
为什么?
How so?

1342
01:57:51,512 --> 01:57:55,650
我被炸的时候 我的两只手都在方向盘下面
When I got blown up, I had both of my hands on the bottom of the steering wheel.

1343
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:59,021
在炮弹爆炸之前 我把我的手松开了
And right before the explosion went off, I took my hand off,

1344
01:57:59,121 --> 01:58:01,450
拿了一根香烟 放在我手里
grabbed a cigarette, stuck it in my mouth.

1345
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,830
我点烟的时候 炸弹爆炸了
And when I went to go light it, the explosion happened.

1346
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:08,830
它把整个方向盘和我的左手都炸掉了
And it took the whole bottom of the steering wheel and my left hand off.

1347
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:13,953
我这样特别幸运 它还是把我的右手毁了 但是...
And I was lucky that I had this. I mean, it still fucked up my right hand, but...

1348
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:15,471
- 是啊  - 它还在
- Yeah.  - I still got it.

1349
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:18,824
- 你还抽烟吗?  - 是啊 我还抽烟
- And you still smoke?  - Yeah, I still smoke.

1350
01:58:25,747 --> 01:58:30,203
没打中 往右三英尺 拜托 维恩 你能干得更好的
Miss. Three inches to the right. Come on, Wynn. You can do better than that.

1351
01:58:31,353 --> 01:58:33,807
把这个往右边偏一点
Bring this to the right.

1352
01:58:33,957 --> 01:58:37,492
你两只眼睛都要张开 你会很惊讶扳机的作用
Make sure you keep both eyes open. Let that trigger surprise you.

1353
01:58:37,592 --> 01:58:40,028
我们不是在打坏人 我们在打纸
We're not shooting bad guys. We're shooting paper.

1354
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:42,130
你这个传奇能不能不要给我搞破坏?
How about The Legend stops trying to fuck up my shot?

1355
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,648
- 行不行?  - 那你能不能打中一次?
- How about that?  - How about you hit one?

1356
01:58:45,735 --> 01:58:46,741
- 击中!  - 就这样
- Hit!  - There you go.

1357
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:52,424
爽啊 哥们 感觉就像我的蛋蛋回来了
Bull's eye, boy. Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back.

1358
01:58:53,374 --> 01:58:55,844
你为什么要和我们待在一起?
Why you spending all this time with us, man?

1359
01:58:55,944 --> 01:58:57,613
我知道你有家庭
I know you got a family.

1360
01:58:57,713 --> 01:59:00,316
我听说你在去打仗之前收集了很多鞋子?
I heard you had a boot collection before the war?

1361
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:02,625
所以我在想 我们好像尺寸差不多
So I was thinking, I saw we were about the same size.

1362
01:59:03,352 --> 01:59:06,658
说真的 哥们 你为什么要这样?
Seriously, man. Why do you do it?

1363
01:59:06,758 --> 01:59:09,357
我们互相照顾 对吧?
Well, we take care of each other, right?

1364
01:59:09,457 --> 01:59:12,144
看看你能不能连续打中两次
Let's see if you can't hit two in a row.

1365
01:59:13,163 --> 01:59:15,030
来吧 哥们 你能做到的
Come on, man. You got this.

1366
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:18,221
- 击中!  - 太棒了
- Hit!  - Nice.

1367
01:59:23,071 --> 01:59:25,615
- 击中!  - 
- Hit!  - Goddamn.

1368
01:59:26,442 --> 01:59:27,861
现在谁是传奇?
Who's the legend now?

1369
01:59:29,477 --> 01:59:33,031
你不会喜欢这个称号的 相信我
That's a title you don't want. Trust me.

1370
01:59:37,936 --> 01:59:39,834
嘿 你能不能跳下来? 我会把它们递给你
Yo, will you hop down? I'll give 'em to you.

1371
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:45,980
- 你想再拿一个吗?  - 好啊
- You add one more?  - Yeah.

1372
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:49,305
- 好吧 把它们搬进去  - 好的
- All right, take 'em inside.  - All right.

1373
02:00:11,755 --> 02:00:13,403
过来
Come here.

1374
02:00:16,827 --> 02:00:18,928
这里的生活也不差 对吧?
It's not a bad life out here, is it?

1375
02:00:19,028 --> 02:00:21,331
让他都笑起来了
Got a smile on his face.

1376
02:00:21,431 --> 02:00:23,850
我看他挺开心的
Looks cheery to me.

1377
02:00:24,067 --> 02:00:26,520
做他爱做的事
Just doing his thing.

1378
02:00:28,505 --> 02:00:30,858
和他挥手告别吧
Wave goodbye to him.

1379
02:00:39,749 --> 02:00:42,118
哦! 操 谁干的?!
Oh! Fuck, who is that?!

1380
02:00:42,218 --> 02:00:44,889
- 哦! 宝贝 是你吗?  - 是啊哈哈!
- Oh! Babe, is that you?  - Yep-A-Doo-Dee!

1381
02:00:44,989 --> 02:00:47,452
- 宝贝 我他妈受伤了 卧槽  - 怎么了?
- Baby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit.  - What?

1382
02:00:47,552 --> 02:00:51,095
没事 我没事 我没事! 我没事 操
No, I'm all right. I'm all right! I'm all right. Fuck.

1384

出了什么事? 别...
What happened? Don't...

1385
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:01,123
让一颗心脏停止跳动这事真的很大
You know that it's a heck of a thing to stop a beating heart.

1386
02:01:01,473 --> 02:01:02,719

Hands in the air.

1398
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:44,665
现在 你把手放下
Now, you drop them drawers.

1399
02:01:46,317 --> 02:01:49,536
慢点放下
But you drop 'em nice and easy.

1400
02:01:50,559 --> 02:01:52,624
宝贝 看看你自己
Oh, baby, look at you.

1401
02:01:52,724 --> 02:01:55,509
- 看看你自己  - 看看你自己
- Look at you.  - Look at you.

1402
02:01:55,959 --> 02:01:57,688
我能和你说一件事吗?
Can I tell you something?

1403
02:01:57,788 --> 02:02:00,699
- 和法官说吧  - 别闹
- Tell it to the judge.  - Stop it.

1404
02:02:00,799 --> 02:02:04,034
不 我真的为你感到骄傲 我怎么说都不够
No. I am so proud of you, and I don't tell you enough.

1405
02:02:04,134 --> 02:02:06,939
我为你骄傲 你真是个好爸爸
I'm so proud of you. And you're such a great father.

我的丈夫回来了我真的很开心
And I am so happy that I've got my husband back.

1407
02:02:11,576 --> 02:02:14,392
我也知道你为了到这里来有多努力
And I also know how hard you fought to get here.

1408
02:02:15,714 --> 02:02:18,397
你值得我为你努力
You're worth fighting for.

1409
02:02:19,585 --> 02:02:23,072
现在再和我说一件事 你... 给这条牛仔裤打褶皱了?
Now tell me one other thing. Did you... did you pleat those jeans?

1410
02:02:23,222 --> 02:02:25,557
是的 女士 我想它们应该就在下面
Yes, ma'am. I believe they're right down the middle.

1411
02:02:25,657 --> 02:02:27,760
哦 你现在就是个普通的老牛仔了
Oh, you're just a regular old cowboy again.

1412
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:30,462
是的 那你现在... 现在要不真的把它们放下?
That's right. Now, why don't you... why don't you really drop them drawers?

1413
02:02:30,562 --> 02:02:33,332
我没穿啊 宝贝
I'm not wearing any drawers, baby.

1414
02:02:33,432 --> 02:02:35,716
我有四分钟
I got four minutes.

1415
02:02:36,206 --> 02:02:37,353
只需要四分钟吗?
Is that all it takes?

1416
02:02:37,453 --> 02:02:41,856
不 只需要两分钟 然后我还需要两分钟来看着你
No, it takes two minutes. But then again I want two minutes to look at you.

1417
02:02:42,309 --> 02:02:45,010
你不去农场吗?
Aren't you going to the range?

1418
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:46,879
你要带谁出去?
Who are you taking out?

1419
02:02:46,979 --> 02:02:49,781
一个海军陆战队的 他妈妈一直求我
This marine. His mama kept asking me.

She parks cars at the elementary school, and she said, "can you help out my son?"

And I just thought... today's the only day I can really do it, so...

1422

但是你现在是8级 那可不行
But, see, you're on level 8, and that doesn't work.

1428
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:13,772
我才4级 我可不想... 我想赢啊 你得让我赢啊
I gotta be on level 4. And I don't want... I wanna win. You gotta let me win.

1429
02:03:13,872 --> 02:03:14,873
不可能!
No way!

1430
02:03:14,973 --> 02:03:16,909

Poke the bear!

1433
02:03:21,214 --> 02:03:23,504

1434
02:03:23,884 --> 02:03:27,334

Like what? Like a beast, right? Like what?

1435
02:03:33,227 --> 02:03:36,349
好吧 兄弟 你照顾好我妻女好吗?
All right, bubba. Y'all look after our women, okay?

1436
02:03:36,449 --> 02:03:38,965

You up for it?

1438

We're gonna go about a two-hour drive and shoot some guns

1442
02:03:56,682 --> 02:03:58,662
