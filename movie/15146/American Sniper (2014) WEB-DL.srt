1
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:16,908
It's a fucking hotbox.

2
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,545
Man,
the fucking dirt here tastes like dog shit.

3
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,380
Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you?

4
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,790
Shut the fuck up.

5
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,329
Gah.

6
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,097
I got a military-age male

7
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,900
that's on a cell phone
watching the convoy, over.

8
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,269
If you think he's reporting troop movement,

9
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,638
you have a green light.

10
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,038
Your call. Over.

11
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,543
Maybe he's just calling his old lady.

12
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,592
He stepped off.

13
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:41,726
Hold on.

14
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:45,364
I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out,

15
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,895
moving towards the convoy.

16
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:54,581
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

17
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,115
Yeah, she's got a grenade.

18
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:07,050
She's got an RKG Russian grenade
she just handed to the kid.

19
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:09,654
You say a woman and a kid?

20
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,490
You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?

21
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,292
Negative. You know the R.O.E.

22
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,526
Your call.

23
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:16,761
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.

24
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,965
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

25
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,316
You got him.

26
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,801
Hey, get back here!

27
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,805
You don't ever leave
your rifle in the dirt.

28
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,342
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:09,280
That was a hell of a shot, son.

30
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,081
You got a gift.

31
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:15,019
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.

32
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,090
Here in the book of acts, several times,

33
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,893
Paul stands in judgment
for what he believes.

34
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,797
And at times, we<i> all</i> have to do that.

35
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,433
I mean, we don't see with his eyes,

36
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,970
so we don't know the glory of his plan.

37
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,537
Our lives unfold before us

38
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,715
like puzzling reflections in a mirror.

39
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,609
- What are you doing?
- And on the day we rise...

40
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,712
Shh!

41
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,713
...we will see with clarity

42
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,917
and understand the mystery of his ways.

43
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,818
Let us pray.

44
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,489
There are three types of people
in this world...

45
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,494
sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.

46
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,362
Now, some people prefer to believe

47
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:00,131
that evil doesn't exist in the world.

48
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:03,100
And if it ever darkened their doorstep,

49
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,369
they wouldn't know how
to protect themselves.

50
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,571
Those are the sheep.

51
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,806
And then you got predators.

52
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,043
They use violence to prey on the weak.

53
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,778
They're the wolves.

54
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,549
And then there are those
who've been blessed

55
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,150
with the gift of aggression

56
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,787
and the overpowering need
to protect the flock.

57
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:28,161
These men are the rare breed
that live to confront the wolf.

58
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,732
They are the sheepdog.

59
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:37,934
Now,
we're not raising any sheep in this family.

60
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,739
And I will whup your ass
if you turn into a wolf.

61
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Wayne.

62
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,446
But we protect our own.

63
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,982
Now, if someone tries to fight you

64
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:54,018
or tries to bully your little brother,

65
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,787
you have my permission to finish it.

66
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:59,157
The guy was picking on Jeff.

67
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,525
Is that true?

68
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,264
Yes, sir. Yes, he was.

69
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,067
Did you finish it?

70
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,208
Well, then you know who you are.

71
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,512
You know your purpose.

72
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:24,216
<i>Chris Kyle is on the horse
big mistress here this evening.</i>

73
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,653
You're all right.

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,722
Now, get ready.

75
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,155
<i>...to hold on to it.</i>

76
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,224
<i>Now, last week...</i>

77
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,859
That's good.

78
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,430
<i>So, tonight,
he needs to beat the leading score of 86.</i>

79
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,393
Hey, Jeff.
Looks like your brother did it again.

80
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,563
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen...
Chris Kyle.</i>

81
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,898
Man, wasn't nobody there.

82
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,066
You come out with a belt buckle.

83
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,535
What are you supposed to do with it?

84
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,003
Supposed to get laid with it.

85
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,039
I'm gonna wear it and see
if it puts Sarah in the mood.

86
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,874
Shit, a strong wind'll
put Sarah in the mood.

87
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,308
Oh, is that what they say?

88
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,876
Man, you know what they
called her in high school.

89
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,143
All right. Don't say it.

90
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,145
Sarah sucks-a-lotta...

91
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,147
hey! What'd I say?

92
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,248
Shit, Chris.

93
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,757
Goddamn it.

94
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,590
That was bucking money, those two girls.

95
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:41,993
- Oh, come on.
- And that's why... no.

96
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,528
He kept looking... he had his eyes on<i> her,</i>

97
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,397
and that's why, the last time...

98
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,799
- Wait till you see what this does.
- Yeah.

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,467
That's me, you dog.

100
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,169
Hey, baby. Who wants to fuck a rodeo star?

101
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,371
What the fuck?

102
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,638
You said you wasn't coming home
until tomorrow.

103
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,306
- I said what?
- No, I just didn't...

104
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,143
- well, you should be...
- Chris, just leave him alone, all right?

105
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,710
- He didn't do anything!
- Easy. Easy. I didn't know shit, man.

106
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,811
- Help!
- Chris, leave him alone!

107
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,948
Fucking Chris, leave him alone!

108
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,350
Goddamn it! What is wrong with you?

109
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,684
He didn't know, all right?

110
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,354
- Oh, he didn't know?
- I didn't know, man.

111
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,155
- What didn't you know?
- Just give me my hat.

112
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,857
- Get his hat, baby.
- He didn't know, okay? He didn't know.

113
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,225
He didn't know what?
Whose rifles did you think those were?

114
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,227
Those clothes,
them men's clothes weren't hers?

115
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:17,595
Is that what you didn't know?
You fucking son of a bitch?

116
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:18,929
What?
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

117
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,398
Chris,
you don't have to fucking punch everyone!

118
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,334
Put that fucking hat on
and get the fuck out.

119
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,339
What the fuck is wrong with you?

120
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,808
Get out.

121
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,677
You know what?
I don't know what you expect from me.

122
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,244
You know, you just drag me out here

123
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:36,580
and then you run off with
your brother every damn weekend.

124
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,648
Whew!

125
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,417
Why do you think I did this, huh?

126
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,419
I do this to get attention!
don't you get that?

127
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,691
Get your stuff and get out.

128
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:52,196
Fine. Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fine.

129
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,432
You think you're a cowboy 'cause you rodeo.

130
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:58,202
You're not a cowboy.
You're just a lousy ranch hand.

131
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,173
And you're a shitty fucking lay.

132
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,812
don't say it.

133
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,215
When's the wedding?

134
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,586
I understand what you're saying,

135
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:19,856
but, you know,
we get to travel over the whole state.

136
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:23,128
Different city every weekend.

137
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,129
Broncs and steers.

138
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,499
I don't know. Maybe she's right, though.

139
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,669
- She's right?
- Right about what, Chris?

140
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,805
She's not right, man. We're cowboys.

141
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:37,008
- We're living the dream.
<i>- This is a special report.</i>

142
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,076
<i>Those explosions set to go off
at the U.S. embassies</i>

143
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:42,812
<i>in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania,
and Nairobi, Kenya,</i>

144
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:44,882
<i>were clearly a part of someone's war</i>

145
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:46,316
<i>against the United States.</i>

146
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:49,720
<i>More than 80 dead, more than 1,700 injured</i>

147
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,122
<i>in two bomb blasts today...</i>

148
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,657
Hey, Jeff. Jeff.

149
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,058
- Hey.
<i>- ...450 Miles apart.</i>

150
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,494
Look at this.

151
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,263
<i>It is still unclear
at this hour who our enemy is.</i>

152
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,331
<i>Although the embassies
were obviously the targets...</i>

153
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,901
Look what they did to us.

154
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,601
<i>...most of the dead and injured
are not Americans.</i>

155
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:08,505
<i>Still, eight Americans,
including one child, are dead,</i>

156
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,509
<i>and five are still missing.</i>

157
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:17,047
- So, you're from Texas.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,383
- You're a patriot.
- Yes, sir.

159
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,185
And you're pissed off.

160
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,887
I'm looking to be of service.

161
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,556
- You like to fight?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,356
You like to fight. Okay.

163
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:29,763
Well, why don't you meet the warrior elite?

164
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,862
- SEALs.
- Yep.

165
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,330
Sea, air, and land.

166
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,332
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir.

167
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,768
No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a heart.

168
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,204
Most men, they wash out, they quit.

169
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,775
But I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.

170
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,942
This is where the fun stops, guys!

171
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,711
Take it, girls! Take it!

172
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,314
That's it, girls. Take it. Take it.

173
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,449
Only hurts the first time.

174
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,183
What we got here? You a quitter, boy?

175
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:56,120
- Hooyah, no, instructor Rolle.
- Bullshit!

176
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:57,922
Yo ass is fleet meat if I ever did see it!

177
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,356
don't turn away from me, son.

178
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,459
You look at me and you take this shit.

179
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,725
Hooyah, sir!

180
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:03,927
Damn, you old as fuck!

181
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,162
You join the Navy 'cause you had

182
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,696
such a good goddamn time on Noah's ark?

183
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:07,731
How old are you, boy?

184
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,499
- Hooyah, 30!
- 30?

185
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,302
Your fart dust could have
fathered half these boys.

186
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,973
We gonna weed through the quitters.

187
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,109
Yeah, we gonna find us
a goddamn warrior or two today.

188
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,576
Dauber, are you sure
you're from Connecticut?

189
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:22,245
I ain't never met no hick
from Hartford before.

190
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,115
Hooyah, instructor Friday!
Country's countrywide.

191
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:27,051
I came here to kill terrorists.

192
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,253
Who the fuck told your ass to giggle?

193
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:32,023
Hooyah, no one, instructor Rolle!

194
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,791
Did I ask you to open up your mouth?

195
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,125
Hooyah, no, instructor Rolle.

196
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:38,262
Look at your fat, pasty, giggly ass.

197
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,464
Damn, son!

198
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,767
You a big Dr. pepper,
cheeto-eating motherfucker.

199
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,470
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

200
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,738
Biggles.

201
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,873
That's your name from now on, sunshine.

202
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,240
And that's your ticket home.

203
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,008
"D"! What are you still doing in my line,

204
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,311
trying to make this team?

205
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,811
Everybody knows black guys don't swim.

206
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:56,848
It's all right, sir. I'm not black.

207
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,882
- No?
- No. I'm the new black.

208
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,451
We run slow, we jump low,

209
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,152
we swim good, and we shop at gap.

210
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,754
And I make the white folk proud

211
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,190
when I hose down their ladies.

212
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,591
I dick 'em down!

213
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,893
Hooyah!

214
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:11,494
There it is!

215
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,230
<i>That</i> is a quitter.

216
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,100
You say goodbye, I say good riddance.

217
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:19,336
He quits on you here,
he's gonna quit in the field of battle.

218
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,004
When shit gets hairy, he won't step up.

219
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,840
Your ass gets shot, he won't pull you out.

220
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,709
I'm looking for warriors!

221
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,777
Seven!

222
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:28,379
Keep counting!

223
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,479
Eight!

224
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,514
I can't hear you!

225
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:31,749
Nine!

226
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,082
You want me to call your mama, old man?

227
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,686
Maybe she could come and take your place.

228
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,120
This is foreplay!

229
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,056
I'm about to turn on some Marvin Gaye

230
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:40,157
and get in that ass!

231
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:42,792
That's what I'm talking about!

232
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,995
Squirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel,
where the fuck are your nuts?

233
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,864
Oh, they're gone for good, sir.

234
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,633
They crawled back up inside.

235
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,368
But they are warm.

236
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,202
Big talk from a little man!

237
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:56,040
Now you. How about you, old man?

238
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,843
Huh? How you feeling?

239
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,677
Hooyah, dangerous.

240
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,245
Feeling dangerous.

241
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:03,880
Hooyah!

242
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,517
Kyle's feeling dangerous.

243
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,952
Move!

244
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,995
Take seats!

245
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,365
56 degrees, so fresh, so clean.

246
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,500
Oh!

247
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:27,305
Mother nature's got something for you!

248
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,674
Only a few more hours,
and you're Navy SEALs!

249
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,851
- I'm the only one who's hit one, so...
- Yeah.

250
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,186
Boom!

251
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,388
Oh, yeah.

252
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,790
- Chris, your turn, man.
- No, you got one more.

253
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,191
I got one more? All right.

254
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,722
All right. One more. Here we go.
Here we go.

255
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:54,840
Hey, we want a smaller target,
we'll use your arm, man.

256
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,902
Hello.

257
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,570
Hi.

258
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,872
How you doing?

259
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,711
Good. Thank you.

260
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,710
Can I, uh, get you a drink?

261
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:11,883
Will a drink make you
six inches taller and charming?

262
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,683
Will it make you<i> not</i> married?

263
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,252
- I'm not...
- yeah.

264
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,754
I just watched you take
your ring off, okay?

265
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,727
don't be a scumbag. Go home.

266
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:24,898
Oh, my God.

267
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,365
It may have been the leather pants.

268
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,369
Oh, yeah?

269
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,571
What kind of pants does a girl have to wear

270
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,172
to be left alone?

271
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,307
Well, maybe corduroy.

272
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,476
I mean, is that how it is with you guys?

273
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:42,547
You're, like,
suddenly single after three beers?

274
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,316
Oh, no. After three beers,
all I know is to get a fourth.

275
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,051
Oh, that's great. That's great.

276
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,452
Real redneck.

277
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,321
Oh, I'm not a redneck. I'm from Texas.

278
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:53,957
What's the difference?

279
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,694
Well,
we ride horses and they ride their cousins.

280
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,463
What do you do for work?
You're obviously military.

281
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:02,199
Oh, uh, I Polish dolphins.
They're in captivity.

282
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,667
What I do is just sort of
scrape off the crustaceans.

283
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,336
Do I look stupid to you?

284
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,396
No. Honestly, you look a little sad.

285
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,979
Am I, uh, tall enough to buy you a drink?

286
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,879
Not until you tell me what you do.

287
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,947
Okay. How about this?

288
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,282
Hey, Greg? Get two shots.

289
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,018
How 'bout we do a shot for a question?

290
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,421
Every time you ask me a question and
I answer, you got to do a shot.

291
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,056
- Same, vice versa.
- Game on.

292
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,825
You can leave the bottle, too.

293
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,192
Okay, shoot.

294
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:31,027
All right.

295
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:33,263
You're obviously military. What branch?

296
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,100
I just finished BUD/S,
heading to sniper school.

297
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,835
Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?

298
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,671
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,840
That's two questions.

300
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,841
Shit.

301
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,779
Really?

302
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,309
Oh, I didn't really mean
you had to do that.

303
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,284
Okay. Shit.

304
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:57,187
I know all about you guys.
My sister was engaged to a SEAL.

305
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,156
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.

306
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,557
- Mm-hmm.
- Hold on.

307
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:02,725
How you know all about us?
What do you mean?

308
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:05,528
What I mean is, you're a bunch
of arrogant, self-centered pricks

309
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,230
who think you can lie and cheat

310
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,800
and do whatever the fuck you want.

311
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,168
I'd never date a SEAL.

312
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,271
Wait. Why would you say I'm self-centered?

313
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,571
I'd lay down my life for my country.

314
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,008
Why?

315
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,442
'Cause it's the greatest country on earth,

316
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:20,143
and I'd do everything I can to protect it.

317
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:21,879
Look, I'm sorry what
happened to your sister,

318
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,881
but that's not me.

319
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,716
It's nice to meet you.

320
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,319
Where are you going?

321
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,720
Well, I was just gonna go home

322
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:32,457
because you said you wouldn't date a SEAL,
so...

323
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,359
I said I'd never<i> marry</i> one.

324
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,494
Oh. Oh, okay. Well, then maybe, hello.

325
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,029
Nice to meet you.

326
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,364
What's your name?

327
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,364
Taya.

328
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,432
Taya.

329
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,667
Chris. I'm Chris Kyle. Nice to meet you.

330
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:45,668
Pleasure.

331
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:49,038
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you

332
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,574
to think you can protect us<i> all.</i>

333
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:51,608
Isn't it, Chris?

334
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,476
Well, our BUD/S officer commander

335
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,580
said that it's three...

336
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,480
okay.

337
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,783
He said there's three things
we got to worry about...

338
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,753
ego, booze, and women.

339
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,692
Well, sounds like you're under attack.

340
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,793
You're pretty.

341
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:13,136
You're so cute.

342
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,738
Hey.

343
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,074
I got you.

344
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:34,201
I'm not going home with you,
so don't even think about it.

345
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,832
Feel breath filling every
cell in your body.

346
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,767
This is our ritual.

347
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:54,104
We master our breath, we master our mind.

348
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:57,674
Pulling the trigger will become
an unconscious effort.

349
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,978
You will be aware of it,
but not directing it.

350
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,414
And as you exhale,
find your natural respiratory pause

351
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,057
and the space between heartbeats.

352
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,669
<i>Hey. This is Taya. I
can't get to the phone.</i>

353
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,137
<i>Leave a message. I'll call you back.</i>

354
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,505
Hey, it's me again.

355
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,274
The guy whose shoes you puked on.

356
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,608
So, uh, yeah, I was thinking

357
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,611
maybe you didn't get that last message,

358
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,514
the last message I left,
or, uh, the one before that.

359
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,515
So, uh, I figured that...

360
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,083
you figured what?

361
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,986
Hey. How are you? How've you been?

362
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,554
Good.

363
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,691
Good. Uh... Wow. Uh... What are you up to?

364
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:50,161
Not a lot. You?

365
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,701
Uh, no, just, uh, excited to talk to you.

366
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,908
Aim small, miss small.

367
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,909
If you aim for a shirt button,
you might miss by 2 inches.

368
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,920
If you aim for his shirt,
you might miss by 2 feet.

369
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,020
You better close those groupings, Kyle.

370
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,289
Yes, sir.

371
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,624
God.

372
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,360
Whoo!

373
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,962
Not bad. What do we get for that?

374
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,064
Top shelf.

375
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,199
Uh, I like that one. Brown one.

376
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Sure. Here you go.

377
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,300
Great.

378
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,602
- Oh, look!
- Thank you, sir.

379
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,836
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

380
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,471
Hello.
Oh, good. That looks good on you.

381
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,374
So, did you always want to be a soldier?

382
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,277
Oh. Uh, no. I wanted to be a cowboy.

383
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,877
But, I don't know. I did that.

384
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,681
Thought I was meant for something more.

385
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,482
Mm. So you started
rescuing girls from bars?

386
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,819
I think I rescued that bar from<i> you.</i>

387
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:53,156
You like country music?

388
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,692
Only when I'm depressed.

389
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,327
How about kids? You want kids?

390
00:19:58,328 --> 00:19:59,863
Yeah, someday.

391
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:03,233
My mom says I have a nose
for picking the wrong men.

392
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:07,170
Well, that's a shitty
thing to say to a girl.

393
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,639
Well, I've proven her right.

394
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,041
Them wrong picks put you here,

395
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,178
made you who you are.

396
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,883
I like who you are.

397
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:19,516
You ever think about what happens

398
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:21,684
when there's a real person
on the end of that gun?

399
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:22,818
I don't know.

400
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:25,584
I just hope I can do my job
when that day comes.

401
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,370
Are we looking at the same target?

402
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,939
You're spitting dust.

403
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,339
And don't worry.

404
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,478
We can always use corpsmen
for the guys who can't shoot.

405
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,204
Oh, fuck.

406
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,037
You're trembling.

407
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,275
I know it.

408
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,642
We don't have to do this if you don't...

409
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:19,943
no, I want to. I do.

410
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,011
Yeah?

411
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:23,130
You just feel real and it scares me.

412
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,725
You got your off-eye shut?

413
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:37,460
Well, if I close my off-eye,

414
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,462
then I can't see what's out there.

415
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:40,998
There's nothing out there but the target.

416
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,066
Negative. Sir, there is
something out there.

417
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,601
Punch it.

418
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,937
Will push-ups help?

419
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,910
Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe.

420
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,650
I'm better when it's breathing.

421
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,318
<i>...by what appeared
to be another passenger plane.</i>

427

<i>with the flames and the smoke</i>

<i>billowing out the other side of the tower.</i>

430
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,867
<i>It's hard for me to tell</i>

431
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:21,104
<i>exactly which is the north side
and which is the South side.</i>

432
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,640
<i>But it appears it's coming out
of the north side there.</i>

433
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:26,910
<i>And then, moments ago,
these incredible images.</i>

434
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:28,479
<i>I believe that's the first one.</i>

435

<i>That's the South tower collapsing.</i>

436

437

<i>one of those implosions

nothing controlled about this.</i>

439
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,396
<i>This is devastation.</i>

440

Welcome to Fallujah.

486
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:06,669
The new wild west of the old Middle East.

487
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,337
Aqi put a price on your heads,

488
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:10,806
and now extremists from around the globe

489
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,942
are flooding the borders to collect on it.

490
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:16,246
You snipers,
you're gonna be paired with a marine

491
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:19,082
to watch your back
and inserted along the main road

492
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,951
to do overwatch for 1st marines
going door to door.

493
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:25,088
Your job is to protect
those marines at all costs.

494
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,156
This city has been evacuated.

495
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:30,326
Any military-age male who is still here

496
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:31,961
is here to kill you.

497
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:36,683
Let's bring these boys in safe
and get our asses back home.

498
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:55,953
Out, out, out!

499
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:59,855
I'd keep that head down, Tex.

500
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,058
Muj got snipers, too, you know.

501
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,598
A sniper won't aim for your head.

502
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,265
Man, they got this one sniper

503
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,149
that's been hitting head shots
from 500 yards out.

504
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,807
They call him Mustafa.

505
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:21,745
He's in the Olympics.

506
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,720
They got sniping in the Olympics now?

507
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,261
Hold on.

508
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:42,132
I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out,

509
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,663
moving towards the convoy.

510
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:51,550
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

511
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,085
She's got a grenade.

512
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,819
She's got an RKG Russian grenade
she just handed to the kid.

513
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,422
You say a woman and a kid?

514
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,459
You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?

515
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,793
Negative. You know the R.O.E.

516
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,060
Your call.

517
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,063
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.

518
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,801
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

519
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,518
Fuck, that was gnarly.

520
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,586
What the hell?

521
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,543
Fucking evil bitch.

522
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:03,413
Get up. Keep moving.

523
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,915
Nice shooting, Tex. Hell of a call.

524
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:07,518
Roger that. Good looking out, Navy.

525
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,884
Fuck, did you hear that, man?

526
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,865
Get the fuck off me.

527
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,481
Where is everybody?

528
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:40,016
Oh, we're just picking our dicks here, man.

529
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,018
We're training those
fucking hajji soldiers.

530
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,585
Yeah, why aren't<i> you</i> out there?

531
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:47,089
Well, I have the shits.

532
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,791
What, reading a comic book?

533
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,759
It's a fucking graphic novel, man.

534
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,432
There's a big difference.

535
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,466
I heard you were on fucking fire out there.

536
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,469
Marc Lee came in,
said you popped your cherry.

537
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,104
Is that right?

538
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,775
There was a kid who, uh,
barely had any hair on his balls.

539
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,977
Mother gives him a grenade,

540
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,096
sends him out there to kill marines.

541
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:17,819
Dude, that's evil like I never seen before.

542
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,456
Yeah. But, hey, man,

543
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,191
you know that kid could have taken out

544
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,427
like 10 fucking marines, right?

545
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,595
Yeah, but I killed him.

546
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,329
You did your job.
That's the end of the story.

547
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,931
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned

548
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:30,733
that first one to go down.

549
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:37,815
Riley, it's okay. Don't have the actuals.

550
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,652
- Whoa!
- Fuck, man!

551
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,920
What the hell?

552
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,989
That was your overwatch, Einstein.

553
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,494
You can thank him later.

554
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,796
Let's move!

555
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,832
Keep going.

556
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,145
Hurry up.

557
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,981
Disperse!

558
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:29,211
Cease fire! Cease fire!

559
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:49,616
Whoa.

560
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,096
Eyes on the rooftop!
Keep your eyes up there!

561
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,662
Man down! Man down!

562
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,064
We need a corpsman over here now!

563
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:49,531
Enemy sniper located.

564
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:54,939
Approximate grid,
Quebec-Romeo, 1-5-5-6-0-4.

565
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:03,779
Smells like piss in here.

566
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,248
Yeah, well...

567
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,718
You covered our asses out there, man.
Some ballsy shots.

568
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,018
Fuck. They were clean, right?

569
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,255
Hell yeah, they were.

570
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:13,722
That fucking sniper went right up our ass!

571
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:15,592
Yeah, I already chewed out security detail.

572
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,059
It ain't gonna happen again.

573
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,460
It<i> better</i> not happen again.

574
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:20,329
- There's a hot spot 400 meters out.
- All right.

575
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,332
I'm gonna go write up
some shooter statements.

576
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,600
How many'd you get?

577
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,668
I got six... oh. No, that's not true.

578
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:28,938
I got eight, but they dragged two off.

579
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,673
You got six?

580
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:32,576
- Yeah. Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

581
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,576
You just got more than the rest
of the snipers combined.

582
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,212
Yeah, but they<i> got</i> one of us.

583
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:38,272
You can't shoot what you can't see.

584
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,552
His wife said he was carrying a Koran.

585
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,621
Look, I don't know what a Koran looks like,

586
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,588
but I can tell you what he<i> was</i> carrying.

587
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:49,191
It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s,

588
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,794
and it looked just like an AK-47.

589
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,913
So you tell<i> me</i> what he was carrying.

590
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,508
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

591
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,309
Ladies and genitals, listen up!

592
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,710
We have a legend in our midst!

593
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:11,046
Round of applause for the legend!

594
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:12,547
There we go.

595
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,549
We're so proud of you back
home on the range, boy.

596
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,553
Now, it's been said that the legend here

597
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,455
can kill 100 men with one blow.

598
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:22,524
Or, no, it was, uh...
what was... nah, it was... fuck.

599
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:25,294
What was it? It was one...
one blow from a single man.

600
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,529
He blew 100... Men.

601
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,765
And he's single. And...

602
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:31,901
goddamn it! Shit!

603
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,736
Oh, shit!

604
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,270
- Damn, man.
- Oh, fuck.

605
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,939
You want a food fight?

606
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,040
Come on.

607
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,142
Shit.

608
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,313
Only way to shut you up.

609
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:45,314
Have you killed anyone yet?

610
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:49,752
That is<i> not</i> the way the call
home is supposed to go, babe.

611
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:53,055
don't be weird with me. Seriously.

612
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,223
I want you to tell me everything.

613
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:57,192
Well, there's certain things

614
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,428
you just can't say over the phone.

615
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,096
Okay, you knocked me up, right?

616
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:04,466
And I'm sitting here by myself
literally assembling baby cribs,

617
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,201
and you can't talk to me?

618
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:08,271
That's your big plan?

619
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,808
You guys almost done over there yet?

620
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:15,278
I can't stop thinking
about that little pink number

621
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,047
you wore on our honeymoon.

622
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:20,750
Yeah, it's called a nightgown.

623
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,286
Yeah.

624
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:26,823
And three days...

625
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,991
three days is<i> not</i> a honeymoon.

626
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:32,028
Well, it was a good three days.

627
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,200
I miss you real bad.

628
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:40,236
I miss you, too.

629
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,638
Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?

630
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,739
Yeah.

631
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,408
Hold on. Hold on a second.

632
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,777
Let me just...

633
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:52,848
I got a phone in one hand
and a gun in the other,

634
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:54,683
so I don't know what I'm gonna do.

635
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:58,273
Well, you're gonna have to decide
what's more important, baby.

636
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,823
Oh, you're a horny preggers.

637
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,457
<i>Fat</i> and horny.

638
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,458
It's fucking disgusting.

639
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:07,263
If you were 300 pounds, I'd still do you.

640
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,032
So romantic.

641
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,868
How's my boy?

642
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,638
Nobody said it's a boy.

643
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,107
I can't wait to see the way
you're gonna be with him.

644
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,311
How do you know?

645
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,145
I just know.

646
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:25,314
I can sense it.

647
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,082
I hope you're right.

648
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,755
Baby, I<i> am</i> right.

649
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:33,756
Hey, did your dad get ahold of you?

650
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:35,892
Mm, I haven't checked my e-mails.

651
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,359
Shit.

652
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,529
Okay, you need to hang up and call him,
all right?

653
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,830
Why? What's wrong?

654
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,064
Fuck. I'm so selfish.
I wasn't even thinking.

655
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,767
Taya, what's wrong?

656
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:47,102
What happened?

657
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,105
Your little brother deployed.

658
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,406
What do you mean?
What happened to jump school?

659
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,676
No, he didn't get in.

660
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,843
You just hang up and call your dad, okay?

661
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:58,247
Wait. What do you mean?
Deployed where? Where is he?

662
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:00,982
Over there.

663
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:03,386
He's headed to Iraq.

664
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,155
I'm sorry, honey.

665
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:12,995
The man with the blade,
he's a Jordanian militant.

666
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:16,131
He's funded by Bin Laden.
He's trained by Bin Laden.

667
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:18,901
He is loyal to Bin Laden.

668
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,671
His name is Zarqawi.

669
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,739
Now, this asshole is right now

670
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,542
the crown prince of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

671
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:31,113
His mercenary army, aqi,
they're 5,000 strong.

672
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:33,515
Now, these guys are not
your average shit-kickers.

673
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:36,352
These guys are well trained,
they are well paid.

674
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:37,687
And right now, they are waging

675
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,723
the largest urban assault since Vietnam.

676
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,526
Zarqawi and his lieutenants,

677
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,560
these are our top priority.

678
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:48,931
Now, there is only one way
to root these guys out,

679
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:51,567
and that is to go door to door,
house to house,

680
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,136
until we find them

681
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,171
or we find someone who will
give us their whereabouts.

682
00:37:56,172 --> 00:38:00,977
So, we are going to need to
clear 10 structures an hour,

683
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,779
which, I know, is a lot.

684
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,113
It's aggressive.

685
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:07,082
We're gonna be loosening things
up with air support.

686
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:11,520
This is the highest priority
target we have to date.

687
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:14,357
I want this asshole dead or captured.

688
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,091
Do you understand?

689
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:19,931
Are there any questions?

690
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,165
I'll tell you something.

691
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,634
These marines keep rushing in
like they're doing,

692
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,968
they're gonna have their asses shot off.

693
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,002
Well, they're marines.

694
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,636
They don't get the training we do.

695
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:30,471
Half these guys were civilians
six months ago.

696
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:31,640
Well, let's coach them up.

697
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:32,908
I'll show them how team guys do it.

698
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,509
I'll lead the unit on the street.

699
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,111
No, can't do that. We
need you on overwatch.

700
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:37,913
Oh, come on.
If I'm on the street, Marc, I could...

701
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,883
look, house-to-house is
the deadliest job here, man.

702
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,986
You got some sort of savior complex?

703
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,520
No, I just want to get the bad guys.

704
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:45,888
But if I can't see them,
I can't shoot them.

705
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,589
Look, all these guys, they know your name.

706
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,725
And they feel invincible with you up there.

707
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:50,959
They're not.

708
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,629
They are if they<i> think</i> they are.

709
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,928
Why don't you just keep banging
on the long gun?

710
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:56,677
We'll let these dogs sniff out zarqawi.

711
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,310
You said aqi has a sniper in the Olympics,

712
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:12,714
but Iraq hasn't qualified
a shooter in three games.

713
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:16,420
Well, that's 'cause Mustafa's not Iraqi.

714
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,264
He's from Syria.

715
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:30,600
Regroup!

716
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,167
Hey, once you all gain entry,
I can't see shit.

717
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:36,038
So take it slow and move
through your target.

718
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,105
Understood.

719
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:39,107
Fire in the hole!

720
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:40,117
Go, go, go!

721
00:39:57,527 --> 00:40:00,397
Fuck this.

722
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,633
I'm gonna go clear houses with marines.

723
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,466
You coming?

724
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:07,335
Fuck no, I'm not coming.

725
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:09,004
No, man. I like my life.

726
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,772
I'd actually like to make it home alive.

727
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,207
Look, it's not my job

728
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,942
to go fucking knocking
down doors, all right?

729
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:15,544
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job.

730
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:16,913
I'm not doing that shit.

731
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,816
All right, well,
if I don't see you down there,

732
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,935
you make sure I don't see you again.

733
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,491
Hey. Y'all mind if I roll with you?

734
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:33,062
Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me.

735
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,395
Regroup!

736
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,864
You're that guy,
the one they're calling the legend.

737
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,299
You got like 24 confirmed kills.

738
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,801
- Well, who's counting?
- That's fucking bad-ass.

739
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,839
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker
in Bravo's catching up, yo.

740
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,573
Listen.
I know y'all are meat-eaters, for sure,

741
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:45,808
but I know a couple things,

742
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:47,209
some simple shit I could show you.

743
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,444
Maybe keep us above ground.
What do you say?

744
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:50,346
Yeah. All right.

745
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,552
Right on.

746
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:56,953
Hey, what's that mean, bro?

747
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,027
Breacher up.

748
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:05,127
Moving.

749
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,596
Get down! Get down on the ground right now!

750
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,332
- Get your fucking ass down!
- No, no!

751
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,000
He no understand!

752
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,100
Get down!

753
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:13,169
Why are you here?

754
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,837
You're supposed to be evacuating this area.

755
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,038
Why are you still here?

756
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,138
I am Sheikh Al-Obeidi.

757
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,274
Sheik Alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?!

758
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:20,542
This is my home! I stay!

759
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:22,178
I don't give a fuck it's your home!

760
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,247
- This is a war zone, sir!
- Sir, please!

761
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,381
Get that kid down!

762
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,549
- No! No!
- Come on!

763
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,683
Let's go! Move it!

764
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,017
You, sir. Let me help you.

765
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:30,553
Found these bitches in the back closet.

766
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,720
You are welcome here. You are my guest.

767
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:32,955
How many more you have here?!

768
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,790
But tell the soldiers to come in.

769
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,625
No. This hajji just wants us all
in here so he can blow us up.

770
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:38,995
Go check his ass for a...

771
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,930
if he see American, he know we speak.

772
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,464
Who? Who? Who saw you talking to us?

773
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:43,665
It's very dangerous. Please come in.

774
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,968
Who knows we're talking to you?
Who?!

775
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:48,669
He come. He come. He... he come.

776
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,241
He

777
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:53,875
very bad. Please.

778
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:55,410
- This target's secure?
- Target secure.

779
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:56,611
All right. Bring them in.

780
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:57,846
Get your head down on the ground.

781
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,614
Put your hands behind your back.

782
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,116
Now! Move now!

783
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:03,882
- Please! Please!
- You talk, we'll talk to you.

784
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,327
Bring him in the other room.

785
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:16,031
If he talks to U.S. soldiers,

786
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,100
they will come to his house
and make examples of them.

787
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:20,101
He? Who's he? Who's he?

788
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,241
The man who comes, they call "The Butcher."

789
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,676
He's the despaired one. Son of Shaytan,

790
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,011
son of... son of devil.

791
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:30,542
Oh, he's like an enforcer?

792
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:33,015
Yes, enforcer.

793
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:35,284
- Number-one soldier Zarqawi.
- Zarqawi?

794
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:36,585
Zarqawi.

795
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,120
Yeah, we'd like to know where Zarqawi is.

796
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,089
You know where he is?
You tell us where he is right now.

797
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,957
How can we get him?

798
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,926
Do you have information
for us about Zarqawi?

799
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,497
- Tell us right now.
- You find the Butcher, you find Zarqawi.

800
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,698
He reports to him.

801
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,523
Okay, well, how do we find him?

802
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:54,102
All right,
look at me when I'm talking to you.

803
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:55,339
Where do we find him?

804
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,040
We must understand the risk to them,

805
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,571
but he will ask for money.

806
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,147
$100,000.

807
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,647
You need $100,000?

808
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,531
I have no proof this guy exists.

809
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:12,555
Fatima!

810
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,695
Howdy.

811
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,166
Hello.

812
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,100
This is the proof.

813
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,104
All right, look, I wanna
help you out. I do.

814
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,038
But I need something.
I need phone numbers, address, names.

815
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:33,309
You have to give me something.

816
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,145
Sir. First platoon's pinned down.

817
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,245
Let's move out!

818
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:39,047
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you.

819
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:41,183
Hey! Look at me! I need something.

820
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,419
I can help you out, Sheikh.

821
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,721
You give me a name,
and we<i> will</i> take care of it.

822
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:47,823
I can promise you that.
We will give you safety.

823
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:49,125
Tell me right now!

824
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,759
Amir Khalaf Fanus!

825
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,796
- Emile Anafanoos?
- Amir Khalaf Fanus.

826
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,031
This is the given name of the Butcher.

827
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:59,535
We believe that the Butcher
is Zarqawi's number two man.

828
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,669
This is your guy right here.

829
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,038
Yeah, but you don't know his real name.

830
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:05,241
Otherwise, you'd have written it up there.

831
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,243
We got several aliases.

832
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,812
Now, if "Fanus" is legit...

833
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:13,549
We'll, uh... we'll go see the Sheikh.

834
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,116
He's asking for 100,000.

835
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:16,417
Figures.

836
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:19,120
But if he delivers the Butcher,
he's gonna get it.

837
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:20,756
This is agent Snead, DIA.

838
00:44:20,757 --> 00:44:24,058
I need a name check on
an Amir Khalaf Fanus.

839
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:26,495
Yeah, I'll wait.

840
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:28,897
If we're gonna go back out there,
team 3 can pull security.

841
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:30,566
That's not gonna happen.

842
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,500
Head shed's gonna want contractors
on it if we're humping money.

843
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:34,840
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

844
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,577
All right. Okay.

845
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,793
Let's go see the Sheikh.

846
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,864
Roadkill.

847
00:45:02,865 --> 00:45:05,299
You know the Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer?

848
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,136
They say his weapon of choice
is a fucking drill.

849
00:45:09,137 --> 00:45:12,975
Went to seminary school
before I joined the Navy.

850
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,611
Was close to being a preacher.

851
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,579
And why didn't you?

852
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:21,250
I love to gamble, man.

853
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,918
Love those dice.

854
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,697
That's my kind of preacher.

855
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,370
It's like that now, huh?

856
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:46,174
Oh, haven't you heard? I'm the legend.

857
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:47,509
Hey, babe.

858
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,779
You were right. The doctor says it's a boy.

859
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,113
What?

860
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:55,350
It's a boy!

861
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:57,653
It's a boy?!

862
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,520
Hell, yeah, man.

863
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:00,726
Congratulations!

864
00:46:15,804 --> 00:46:17,305
Chris?!

865
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:20,050
Grab the money! Get to the drop!

866
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,685
- Aah!
- Go! Go!

867
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,216
Grab the bag! Grab the bag!

868
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,762
Chris!

869
00:46:39,762 --> 00:46:42,129
Go! Go! Get the fuck outta here!

870
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,699
We'll come back for them.

871
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,803
Baby?

872
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,571
- I heard one shot.
- Check.

873
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:51,705
Came in at an angle.

874
00:46:51,706 --> 00:46:53,609
Be 300 or more yards out.

875
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,610
Oh, my God.

876
00:46:58,581 --> 00:46:59,948
You got a bead on him?

877
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,751
I got a tiny little window.

878
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:04,653
Aw, shit.

879
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:05,921
I got eyes on the Butcher.

880
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:08,217
He's got the Sheikh's kid on the avenue.

881
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:16,364
Requesting QRF.

882
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:18,232
We're being pinned down by sniper fire

883
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,368
on approach of high value target.

884
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:23,605
Grid 04536236. Over.

885
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:26,040
I wanna pop a smoke 'em
and secure this building.

886
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,336
I'm going to the roof.

887
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,817
Hold up!

888
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,022
Hold.

889
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,023
Holding.

890
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,097
Go!

891
00:47:49,097 --> 00:47:51,867
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

892
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:43,578
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch!

893
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,954
Fuck you!

894
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:57,459
Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess.

895
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,629
You are one dumb son of a bitch,
you know that?

896
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,665
What the hell were you thinking?!

897
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,732
You completely failed
to secure the battlefield.

898
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,901
I'm shutting this whole thing
down pending an inquiry.

899
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:08,236
Get back to base!

900
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:10,205
Hey, we gotta set up a
squad and pursue him.

901
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:12,006
Nope, they're shutting us down.

902
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,540
What do you mean?

903
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:15,444
Can't leave the wire
till they figure this shit out.

904
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,513
Well, he can't just leave us like that.

905
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,649
Hey! I go home in three weeks!

906
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,666
Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks.

907
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,223
Oh, my goodness.

908
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,491
How are you?

909
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,996
What's going on, pop?

910
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:08,666
Hey, mama!

911
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:13,172
Hey.

912
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:19,674
Hey, baby.

913
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:22,243
I thought you were dead.

914
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:24,044
I'm sorry.

915
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:25,247
I'm sorry.

916
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,649
I thought you were dead.

917
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,450
Well, I'm right here.

918
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:29,922
Ohh.

919
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,958
Look at me.

920
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,526
Whew.

921
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,528
- You all right?
- Yeah.

922
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,271
Marc, how you doing?

923
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,421
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

924
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:06,288
I have an alien growing inside me.

925
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,290
And there's a strange man in my bedroom.

926
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,097
Well, it's<i> our</i> bedroom.

927
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:17,804
Your hands feel different.

928
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,738
Oh, no. They're... they're my hands.

929
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:25,874
Why am I so fucking nervous?

930
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,377
- Well,<i> I</i> am, too.
- No, you're not.

931
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,578
- Yes, I am.
- You're lying.

932
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,544
I swear.

933
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:32,212
How do I know some alien in there

934
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:33,948
is not gonna come out and grab me?

935
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,716
In the middle of the night.

936
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:38,185
Then I'm gonna have to...

937
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:39,789
Choke him out.

938
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,660
It's gonna be okay.

939
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:48,300
- Promise?
- Yeah, of course.

940
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,242
Why're you so good with me?

941
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:03,477
Hey, babe. It might be nice to get out.

942
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:05,848
You listening to me?

943
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,649
Chris.

944
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,216
Huh?

945
00:53:09,217 --> 00:53:11,621
What do you wanna do today, hon?

946
00:53:14,422 --> 00:53:18,193
I thought we could just relax here.

947
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:22,634
Okay, we do that.

948
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:27,035
Let's relax.

949
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:29,370
What're you doing?

950
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,904
Putting my foot on you.

951
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:33,905
Well, you know that's...
that's the way to my heart.

952
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,989
I'm coming over.

953
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,524
And that looks great.

954
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,125
Look. He's touching his nose.

955
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,292
How are you feeling?

956
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:54,095
I'm all right. I just want him out.

957
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:56,230
- I'm tired.
- Well, it's gonna be any day now.

958
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:57,598
I hope so.

959
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,701
How 'bout you, Mr. Kyle?
How're you feeling?

960
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:01,535
I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am.

961
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:04,404
I imagine it's hard to decompress.

962
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:06,707
Not really. No.

963
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:09,710
This is the first time
we've left the house.

964
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:12,284
I'm happy to be home. Yeah.

965
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,352
Here, slip this on for me, would ya?

966
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,555
Uh, I think if you wanna
check anything out,

967
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,457
you may wanna check out these knees.

968
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,991
- I don't know what I did, but...
- are you a smoker?

969
00:54:22,992 --> 00:54:24,359
- No, ma'am.
- You drink?

970
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,228
Only when I'm thirsty.

971
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:35,002
It's 170/110.

972
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:37,004
Jesus Christ, Chris.

973
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:38,506
Is that high?

974
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:40,408
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee.

975
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:42,009
But for someone who is sitting down...

976
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:44,412
Oh, I appreciate you, uh,
taking a look at that.

977
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:47,047
I'll look into it. Thank you.

978
00:54:47,048 --> 00:54:48,750
<i>Will</i> you look into it?

979
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:50,288
Yeah.

980
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:53,654
You sabotaged me back there.

981
00:54:53,655 --> 00:54:55,524
What am I supposed to do?
You're not talking.

982
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,759
You act like it's all okay.

983
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,926
It<i> is</i> okay. I'm fine.

984
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,495
You're not fine, Chris, all right?

985
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,629
Your blood pressure is, like,
fucking 170/110.

986
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,267
- It's like...
- babe, I'm driving down the freeway.

987
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,535
It's sunny. It's 72 degrees. I'm fine.

988
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:09,037
There's a war going on.
There's people dying.

989
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:10,471
No one's even talking about that.

990
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:12,073
It's like it's not even happening.

991
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:13,942
We're all on our cell phones,

992
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,310
living our simple, simplistic lives.

993
00:55:16,311 --> 00:55:17,446
It's not even on the news.

994
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,946
- Chris.
- No one cares.

995
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,588
- There's a war going on and I'm headed to the mall.
- Chris. It's happening.

996
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:22,850
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm supposed to be over there.

997
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:24,384
I can't do anything...
what's wrong? You okay?

998
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:25,520
It's happening.

999
00:55:25,521 --> 00:55:27,389
Shit. O-okay. I'm gonna go back.

1000
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:33,328
You're fucking crazy! You know that?

1001
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,196
- It's okay. Hey! Baby, baby.
- Ohh.

1002
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:36,999
Oh, my God.

1003
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Baby.
You look beautiful.

1004
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:42,438
It's fucking happening.

1005
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:46,079
Oh, my baby.

1006
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,181
Look at your mama.

1007
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:54,982
- Hey.
- Hi, baby.

1008
00:55:54,983 --> 00:55:56,517
Hey, little guy.

1009
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:57,986
Hey, baby.

1010
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,287
Huh?

1011
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:01,022
Hey, little guy.

1012
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,924
Look what we did.

1013
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:05,627
- Look what we did. Look what we made.
- Ohh.

1014
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,096
Look what we made.

1015
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,310
The baby's crying.
I thought you were gonna get him.

1016
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:25,480
No, don't bother turning it off.
I already watched it.

1017
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:26,848
Had to make sure you didn't have

1018
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:28,817
an Iraqi girlfriend
sending you sexy videos.

1019
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,218
That's a sniper recording his kills.

1020
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:32,354
That's Mustafa.
He sells that shit on the street.

1021
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,003
Those are American soldiers.

1022
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:38,493
That day that we were on the phone,
was that him?

1023
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:39,494
Was it?

1024
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:42,997
Chris, just talk about it.

1025
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:44,799
You're not protecting me
by not talking about it.

1026
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,767
No, I don't want you getting that
in your head, ya understand?

1027
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:48,002
Well, my imagination is so much worse

1028
00:56:48,003 --> 00:56:49,604
than anything you could tell me.

1029
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:50,705
- Oh, no, it's not. They're savages.
- Chris.

1030
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:51,939
Babe, they're fucking savages.

1031
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,408
It's not about them.

1032
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,912
It's about<i> us.</i>

1033
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,713
What?

1034
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:06,326
You have to make it back to us.

1035
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,864
Okay?

1036
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:18,232
Welcome home, chief.
Colonel Jones is waiting.

1037
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,468
How was the flight?

1038
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,203
Damn longer than Christmas.

1039
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,641
I bet.

1040
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:28,109
Hey. Can you wait a second?

1041
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,078
All right. Hurry up.

1042
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,948
Hey, grunt!

1043
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,082
Chris?

1044
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,850
Hey, brother!

1045
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:37,851
Hi.

1046
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:40,788
You all right? You in one piece?

1047
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:42,790
I heard you been kicking ass out here, man.

1048
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,892
All the guys,
that's what they've been saying.

1049
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,294
- Yeah, that's what they say?
- Yeah.

1050
00:57:46,295 --> 00:57:47,962
How ya doing? You okay?

1051
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:49,497
Oh, shit, it's good to see you.

1052
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:50,765
You're my hero, bro.

1053
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:52,801
Okay? You always have been.

1054
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,335
Let's go, Kyle! Colonel's waiting!

1055
00:57:55,336 --> 00:57:56,572
The legend, huh?

1056
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,375
What happened? You all right?

1057
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,776
Man, I'm gonna miss my ride.

1058
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:04,011
Hey, what happened?

1059
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:05,781
I'm just tired, man.

1060
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:09,618
I'm... I'm going home.

1061
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,722
I'm proud of you.

1062
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:16,357
Dad is, too. Dad's proud of you.

1063
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:18,392
Fuck this place.

1064
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:19,727
Huh?

1065
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:21,562
What'd you say?

1066
00:58:21,563 --> 00:58:25,804
Fuck this place.

1067
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:31,228
Chief, we got to move! Let's go!

1068
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,529
You made chief. Congratulations.

1069
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,196
Thank you, sir.

1070
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:58,966
Gronski's gone. A lot of the top brass are.

1071
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:01,069
Running off a new playbook now.

1072
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,305
I've studied insurgencies
for the last decade.

1073
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:07,040
I know every stone thrown
since before the first century.

1074
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:12,647
These wars are won and lost
in the minds of our enemy.

1075
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:14,448
Yes, sir.

1076
00:59:14,449 --> 00:59:15,918
That you?

1077
00:59:16,918 --> 00:59:20,087
That's a crusader cross. Yes, sir.

1078
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:21,288
Yeah.

1079
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:23,759
You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.

1080
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,495
There's 180,000 on your head. Congrats.

1081
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:27,763
Well, don't tell my wife.

1082
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,941
She might take that number right now.

1083
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:32,267
Understand you wanna put together

1084
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:35,069
a direct action squad to hunt the Butcher.

1085
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,270
Yes, sir.

1086
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:41,008
We got some Intel indicating
his area of operations.

1087
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:44,712
I want you to put the fear
of God into these savages...

1088
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:47,147
And find his ass.

1089
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:49,317
Yes, sir.

1090
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:53,221
All right, let's go get this motherfucker.

1091
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,890
Gonna be a pop quiz before we leave.

1092
00:59:55,891 --> 00:59:57,924
- Small words next time, big legend.
- What'd you say?

1093
00:59:57,925 --> 00:59:59,259
Small words next time.

1094
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,020
I'll tell you those
stories if you want 'em.

1095
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:03,198
One hell of a PowerPoint, man.

1096
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,299
Oh, thanks, Biggles.

1097
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,801
Always gotta say something, motherfucker.

1098
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:09,169
That Bible of yours, is that bulletproof?

1099
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,671
What, the one I put in here?

1100
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:12,774
Yeah. I just... I never saw you open it.

1101
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,610
I assumed...

1102
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,812
God, country, family, right?

1103
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:20,485
You got a God?

1104
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,603
I got a God? You getting weird on me?

1105
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:28,323
You know, growing up in Oregon,

1106
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,424
we had this electric fence
around our property.

1107
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:33,694
Us kids'd grab onto it and see
who could hold on the longest.

1108
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:36,564
War feels kinda like that.

1109
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:38,066
Puts lightning in your bones

1110
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,971
and makes it hard
to hold on to anything else.

1111
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,207
Hey, man, you need to sit this one out?

1112
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,343
I just wanna believe
in what we're doing here.

1113
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,779
Oh, there's evil here. We've seen it.

1114
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,013
Yeah. There's evil<i> everywhere.</i>

1115
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:54,749
Oh, you want these motherfuckers

1116
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,317
to come to San Diego or New York?

1117
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,657
We're protecting more than just this dirt.

1118
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:03,558
All right.

1119
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,967
Let's go kill this fucker.

1120
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:19,339
Bingo. It's the building right here.

1121
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,943
Any apartment on the east side
faces the restaurant.

1122
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:27,650
Go in, sir. Go, go, go.

1123
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,594
Clear.

1124
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:42,304
Other door.

1125
01:01:51,306 --> 01:01:53,841
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Get down on the ground right now.

1126
01:01:53,842 --> 01:01:56,485
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Okay.

1127
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:05,720
Target secure.

1128
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:06,888
I got the window, Chris.

1129
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,022
Set security, boys.

1130
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:09,823
All right, let's get set up.

1131
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:11,192
Corner.

1132
01:02:11,193 --> 01:02:13,311
Let's move them into the other room.

1133
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,966
Y'all ask if he knows him.

1134
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,001
You recognize this guy?

1135
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:23,872
He says he does not.

1136
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:27,677
How 'bout you, son? You
recognize this face?

1137
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:31,312
You sure?

1138
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:33,546
All right, well, you know,
you make sure you tell 'em

1139
01:02:33,547 --> 01:02:35,959
they're not gonna go anywhere until<i> we</i> do.

1140
01:02:38,887 --> 01:02:41,022
Hey, you keep eyes on that window.

1141
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:44,529
Make sure you take pictures
of anybody coming and going.

1142
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,945
What do we got?

1143
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:07,415
16 military-aged males have gone in.

1144
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,850
16?

1145
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:12,553
Yeah, they serve more customers
than a fucking McDonald's.

1146
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:15,561
Here, check this out.

1147
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,328
Is he still in there?

1148
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,064
I clocked one point of entry.

1149
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,165
He's in there,
but it's not gonna be an easy breach.

1150
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,634
Oh, I don't know about that, man.

1151
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:29,035
Probably see the legend
and just let him right in,

1152
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:30,437
you know, big-time celebrity.

1153
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:32,439
Ask him to sign their burka.

1154
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,843
Appear at their child's birthday parties.

1155
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,044
Hey, what is your problem?

1156
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:37,578
I didn't... I didn't promote myself.

1157
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:39,647
Yeah, no shit, motherfucker.
I did that<i> for</i> you.

1158
01:03:39,648 --> 01:03:41,116
You woulda never made chief

1159
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,619
if I hadn't nicknamed you
the fucking myth or some shit.

1160
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,928
He invites you to join him
for an Eid Al Adha supper.

1161
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:58,399
He says, "on this day,
everyone has a seat at my table."

1162
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,070
Oh, that's pretty generous of him.

1163
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:13,647
That was, like, close, man.

1164
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:15,149
Pretty good, man.

1165
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,750
It's very nice.

1166
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:18,285
Take a cucumber.

1167
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:20,821
Take cucumber and put it
in a tub with vinegar.

1168
01:04:20,822 --> 01:04:22,055
Yeah.

1169
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:24,426
Stick in cayenne pepper and a lemon...

1170
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,326
And let it soak overnight.

1171
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:28,163
It's that, and just add vodka.

1172
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,230
That's the idea. You wanna get in on it?

1173
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:32,399
Let's do it, dude.
I'm a ground-floor investor.

1174
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,667
All right.

1175
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:36,257
Biggles, you never cooked
a day in your life.

1176
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:40,640
Dude, that was the real question.

1177
01:04:40,641 --> 01:04:42,009
That was super real.

1178
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,422
All these random people getting behind us.

1179
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,983
Oh, my God, I fell in behind the myth.

1180
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:54,224
Holy shit.

1181
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:59,526
Squirrel? You want some olives?

1182
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:01,699
No, I don't do olives, man.

1183
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,966
You gonna get on that lamb head?

1184
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:07,201
Hell no.

1185
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:09,604
Come on, man. Get some brains.

1186
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,574
I gotta wash my hands.

1187
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:15,609
- Good.
- That's good?

1188
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,977
Hey, man.

1189
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:18,681
This is good, man.

1190
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:32,020
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, man.

1191
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,120
Go check that out.

1192
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:35,855
Stay here, stay here!

1193
01:06:35,856 --> 01:06:37,390
Hey, what the fuck?!

1194
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:38,896
Biggles, help me out.

1195
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:43,497
See that, muj? Huh?

1196
01:06:43,498 --> 01:06:44,832
You see that?

1197
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:47,267
- What the fuck's going on?
- Bring the terp in.

1198
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:49,039
Oh, shit.

1199
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,573
All right.

1200
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:55,243
Now you tell him that he's gonna
be sent off to detention...

1201
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,477
And the Iraqi courts can decide
what to do with him.

1202
01:06:57,478 --> 01:07:00,047
Or he can help us get inside
of that restaurant downstairs.

1203
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:02,351
You tell him. Say it's his choice.

1204
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,915
That's it.

1205
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:38,554
All clear.

1206
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:41,360
Good, good. Moving.

1207
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,132
Assault team set.

1208
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:52,165
We're in tight. Security set.

1209
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,617
Package is moving.

1210
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,621
15 meters out.

1211
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:15,726
10 meters.

1212
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:20,003
5 meters.

1213
01:08:29,003 --> 01:08:30,806
He's knocking.

1214
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:36,278
Whoa, hold.

1215
01:08:37,278 --> 01:08:38,747
They're vetting him.

1216
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:42,784
Lights out, muj.

1217
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,761
Execute. Execute.

1218
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,804
Frag out! Frag out!

1219
01:09:02,595 --> 01:09:04,772
Biggles, anything coming out the back?

1220
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,578
Negative. No movement.

1221
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,319
Oh, shit.

1222
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,952
"D," take him down.

1223
01:09:18,953 --> 01:09:20,090
Got him.

1224
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,096
Get him down.

1225
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:29,362
Oh, shit!

1226
01:09:29,363 --> 01:09:31,064
We found a tunnel. Watch your back.

1227
01:09:31,065 --> 01:09:32,633
Keep your eyes open.

1228
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:35,407
- Contact! Contact!
- Contact!

1229
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:43,045
Contact! Drop back!

1230
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:47,751
White-side! RPG on the white-side!

1231
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:41,904
Butcher's on the move.

1232
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:45,669
Repeat... Butcher's on the move.
I'm in pursuit.

1233
01:10:54,414 --> 01:10:56,416
Butcher's down.

1234
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:58,220
Move in your position.

1235
01:11:19,507 --> 01:11:21,576
I mean, I offered him detention.

1236
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,076
It was his choice.

1237
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:24,444
Picked the wrong side.

1238
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:26,504
It's all there is to it. Fog of war.

1239
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:33,121
Yo, Chris! Fuck it, man.
Let's go. Shit's getting hairy.

1240
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,921
Sir,
we have armed insurgents moving this way.

1241
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:37,362
- We need to make tracks.
- Heck of a job there, chief.

1242
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,202
Y'all want another one, or are you good?

1243
01:12:23,203 --> 01:12:24,471
Look. What is this?

1244
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:25,639
No. Well, you get what it gives you.

1245
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,108
That's how this thing works.

1246
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,343
You don't get that one,
if that's the one you want.

1247
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:30,979
I like that.

1248
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,888
That's good. That's strong.

1249
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,656
Chris Kyle, come on. Your truck's ready.

1250
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:44,058
You can move that all you want.

1251
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,460
Your truck's ready. Im... impossible.

1252
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:48,062
Give me your credit card.

1253
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,763
Okay. Interesting.

1254
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:52,066
I already gave it to ya, I think.

1255
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,634
- Oh, right.
- What?

1256
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,568
Hey, just pick that up off the floor.

1257
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:57,138
- Can you see Chris Kyle's file?
- Make sure you get all of them up.

1258
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,406
Well, you got one back here.

1259
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:00,407
Excuse me, sir?

1260
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,611
Purple?

1261
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:05,011
Are you chief Chris Kyle?

1262
01:13:05,012 --> 01:13:06,179
Yes, sir.

1263
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,982
My name is mads.

1264
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,287
Um, we met in Fallujah. You saved my life.

1265
01:13:13,287 --> 01:13:14,554
I did?

1266
01:13:14,555 --> 01:13:15,790
Yes, sir.

1267
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,591
We were stuck in a house

1268
01:13:17,592 --> 01:13:18,959
until you came in with the 1st marines.

1269
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,493
You were the one that carried me out.

1270
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:22,095
Oh, wow.

1271
01:13:22,096 --> 01:13:23,930
Well,
the marines saved<i> our</i> ass plenty of times.

1272
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:25,431
How are you? You all right? You holding up?

1273
01:13:25,432 --> 01:13:26,567
Great. Yeah.

1274
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,502
I'm... I'm just grateful to be alive.

1275
01:13:29,503 --> 01:13:31,337
It hasn't been...

1276
01:13:31,338 --> 01:13:33,040
- Colt.
- It hasn't been easy.

1277
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,109
Well, you know.

1278
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:39,278
A lot of guys lost more than just a leg.

1279
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:41,215
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1280
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,715
Did you lose some friends?

1281
01:13:42,716 --> 01:13:45,019
Well, that, too.
But I'm talking 'bout the guys that lived.

1282
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,254
You know, that made it back,
but they're just not...

1283
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,422
they're just not back, you know?
They can't seem to get right.

1284
01:13:49,423 --> 01:13:51,224
Yeah.

1285
01:13:51,225 --> 01:13:52,725
Mm-hmm.

1286
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:54,594
Why don't you come down to the v.A.
Sometime?

1287
01:13:54,595 --> 01:13:56,296
The guys would love it.

1288
01:13:56,297 --> 01:13:58,598
They all know who the legend is.

1289
01:13:58,599 --> 01:14:01,035
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

1290
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,036
Hey, buddy.

1291
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:06,505
Can I tell you something?

1292
01:14:06,506 --> 01:14:08,209
Your dad?

1293
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,210
He's a hero.

1294
01:14:11,011 --> 01:14:12,513
That's right.

1295
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,980
He saved my life...

1296
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:15,750
And he, uh...

1297
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:18,551
he helped me get back to my little girl.

1298
01:14:18,552 --> 01:14:20,487
So, thank you for lending him to us.

1299
01:14:20,488 --> 01:14:21,688
Okay.

1300
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:23,958
I wouldn't be here without him.

1301
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:32,502
My family thanks you for your service.

1302
01:14:34,502 --> 01:14:37,103
Okay, thank you. All right.

1303
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:38,272
Take care of yourself.

1304
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,739
- It's great to see you again.
- All right.

1305
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,375
Come down to the v.A. Sometime.

1306
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:42,608
Okay. Yeah.

1307
01:14:42,609 --> 01:14:44,551
Grab your little lizard up there.

1308
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,581
Thank you.

1309
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:48,916
You're welcome.

1310
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,384
- Have a good day.
- You have a good day.

1311
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,585
Okay.

1312
01:14:51,586 --> 01:14:52,853
Bye.

1313
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:55,394
All right, let's go meet
your sister, bubba.

1314
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:26,789
Hey. Some help here? My daughter's crying.

1315
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:32,024
That's my daughter over there.
I think she's crying.

1316
01:15:32,025 --> 01:15:33,492
Can you help tend to her, please?

1317
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:34,930
Excuse me.

1318
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,264
Hey!

1319
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:39,532
Hey, where you going?

1320
01:15:39,533 --> 01:15:41,335
Hey!

1321
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:45,438
Hey, will you tend to my daughter, please?

1322
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:47,307
Hey!

1323
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:54,781
Hey! Tend to my daughter, please!
Right now!

1324
01:15:54,782 --> 01:15:58,654
I'm making memories by myself.

1325
01:16:00,654 --> 01:16:02,724
I have no one to share them with.

1326
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,131
Yeah, well, we got our
whole lives for that.

1327
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:12,265
When does that start?

1328
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:15,769
Even when you're here, you're not<i> here.</i>

1329
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,772
I see you.

1330
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,273
I feel you.

1331
01:16:20,274 --> 01:16:22,247
But you're not here.

1332
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:41,664
I hate the teams for it.

1333
01:16:43,664 --> 01:16:45,198
I do.

1334
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,267
You're my husband.

1335
01:16:47,268 --> 01:16:48,935
You're the father of my children,

1336
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:51,231
but they're the ones that pull you back.

1337
01:16:57,043 --> 01:17:01,619
Yeah, but, you see, they...
they can't wait, and we<i> can.</i>

1338
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:09,693
If you think this war isn't changing you,
you're wrong.

1339
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:15,840
You can only circle the flame so long.

1340
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,614
It's true.

1341
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,660
Cadillac 31 actual,

1342
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:48,028
we're tailing the Butcher's courier

1343
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:49,630
currently on Maryland street.

1344
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:50,863
Over.

1345
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:53,500
Hey! Got the ring.

1346
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,501
From where? From here?

1347
01:17:55,502 --> 01:17:57,970
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah.
It's so much cheaper here.

1348
01:17:57,971 --> 01:18:00,006
- Dude, you bought it from savages?
- Yeah.

1349
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:01,975
How do you know it's not a blood diamond?

1350
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:03,577
Oh, what the fuck do you care, man?

1351
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,580
You've spilled so much blood over here.
You're the legend.

1352
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:07,947
Oh, that's not for a rock.

1353
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:10,349
Ah, what the fuck ever, man.

1354
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,353
That's just hypocritical.

1355
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,920
Hey, ease up on that.
No, don't get too close.

1356
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:15,288
- All right. Hey, I know.
- Hey, did you tell her?

1357
01:18:15,289 --> 01:18:16,956
Did you tell her where you bought it from?

1358
01:18:16,957 --> 01:18:20,134
Fuck no. I'm gonna tell her
I got that shit from Zales.

1359
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:23,997
Hey, you still with us, cookie?

1360
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:25,831
Just a half block back, baby.

1361
01:18:25,832 --> 01:18:27,800
We are wet and ready, big giggles.

1362
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:29,969
You know, "D"...

1363
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,139
I predict in 20 years,
we're gonna have a reunion...

1364
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,008
And you'll be married to a dude.

1365
01:18:35,009 --> 01:18:39,921
As long as you cook and clean.

1366
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:49,025
- Now, there they are.
- Oh, shit.

1367
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,358
Mustafa's got his peepers out.

1368
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:55,234
This motherfucker is Keyser fucking Soze,
bro.

1369
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:13,380
Hey, next time you get a clear shot,

1370
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,181
you try not to miss him, all right?

1371
01:19:15,182 --> 01:19:16,983
Well, I would've gotten him in the alleyway

1372
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:18,984
if I didn't have to save your ass.

1373
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,180
So you gonna be my best man?

1374
01:19:48,181 --> 01:19:50,117
Oh, just me?
Or is it gonna be everybody else, too?

1375
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,471
There's only gonna be one best man, dude.

1376
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,460
Oh!

1377
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:01,194
Vehicle 1 taking fire.

1378
01:20:01,195 --> 01:20:03,685
- Come on, give me a shot.
- All right.

1379
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:26,859
Biggles, move.

1380
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,626
Clear.

1381
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,338
One on me.

1382
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,008
We got him.

1383
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,777
Vehicle is secure.

1384
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:53,380
Set security, Chris.

1385
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,781
Nope.

1386
01:20:54,782 --> 01:20:56,717
Rooftop secure.

1387
01:20:58,018 --> 01:21:00,386
Aren't you worried that she's
gonna take that thing to Zales,

1388
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,822
find out how much you spent?

1389
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:04,023
Well, no, I<i> wasn't.</i>

1390
01:21:04,024 --> 01:21:05,325
Set security.

1391
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:06,893
<i>Now</i> I'm a little worried about it.

1392
01:21:06,894 --> 01:21:08,327
You should be.

1393
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:10,063
What do you mean,
she can trace the diamond to Zales?

1394
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:11,836
I don't think that's gonna...

1395
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,243
you okay, buddy? You're all right.

1396
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,944
Got a man down. Biggles is down.

1397
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:27,719
Northwest corner, rooftop!

1398
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:33,789
Hang in there, bud.

1399
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:40,068
I need a corpsman right now!

1400
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:54,335
Okay, bubba. We're gonna pick
you up and take you downstairs.

1401
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,578
I can walk.

1402
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:14,995
Get him in the Humvee.
Get him in the Humvee.

1403
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,263
Breaking off.

1404
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,733
I got him. I got him.

1405
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:24,170
Come on. Get in. Hang in there, Biggles.

1406
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:25,205
Fuck.

1407
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,006
Hang in there, Biggles.

1408
01:22:27,007 --> 01:22:29,046
Hang in, Biggles.

1409
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:33,211
It's okay.

1410
01:22:33,212 --> 01:22:34,546
Shit, I'm sorry, man.

1411
01:22:34,547 --> 01:22:36,649
For what? What are you sorry for?

1412
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:38,651
It's<i> my</i> fault we went on that roof.

1413
01:22:38,652 --> 01:22:39,853
Am I gonna die?

1414
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,987
Fuck no, Biggles. You're a fucking frogman.

1415
01:22:41,988 --> 01:22:43,590
Frogmen don't fucking die.

1416
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,325
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut.

1417
01:22:45,326 --> 01:22:46,893
We'll get you a fucking canteen of water.

1418
01:22:46,894 --> 01:22:48,961
You're gonna be fucking fine, Biggles.
Hang in there.

1419
01:22:48,962 --> 01:22:52,599
Here, Chris. You make sure she
gets that ring, all right?

1420
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,204
Sure will.

1421
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,938
All right, let's decrease suction.

1422
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:01,140
The retractor, please.

1423
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:02,375
More blood.

1424
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:04,111
How long before we get film on him?

1425
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,879
We need another unit of blood.

1426
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,279
Give me a 3 only.

1427
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,881
All right, saline... now.

1428
01:23:08,882 --> 01:23:10,015
More suction.

1429
01:23:10,016 --> 01:23:11,117
Hold your hands right here.

1430
01:23:11,118 --> 01:23:12,551
Okay.

1431
01:23:12,552 --> 01:23:13,687
Type and cross.

1432
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,747
Get it up. I need those numbers now.

1433
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:26,099
Did you see where it came from?

1434
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,502
Yeah, it was more than 1,000 meters out.

1435
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:32,908
Only one enemy sniper
coulda made that shot.

1436
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,242
Will he make it?

1437
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:38,711
Took a round off the feed tray cover.
Was 48.

1438
01:23:38,712 --> 01:23:40,212
Doesn't look good.

1439
01:23:40,213 --> 01:23:42,750
That's the first SEAL hit, sir.

1440
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,617
Fuck!

1441
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:46,553
Shi'a cab driver we source

1442
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,488
is saying there's a stronghold
seven doors down.

1443
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:51,724
Marine units covered your exfil
are still engaged there.

1444
01:23:51,725 --> 01:23:54,693
I can understand if you want
to stand down and regroup.

1445
01:23:54,694 --> 01:23:57,197
It's up to you.

1446
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,965
Lex talionis.

1447
01:23:58,966 --> 01:24:01,273
Eye for an eye.

1448
01:24:06,273 --> 01:24:08,008
We're going back out.

1449
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,709
Fucking "A."

1450
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,978
Fuck, yes.

1451
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,215
Let's go.

1452
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,895
It's on.

1453
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:46,984
Hey!

1454
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,672
Two klicks out.

1455
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:21,148
Hallway clear.

1456
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:24,753
On the left. Bumping.

1457
01:25:26,753 --> 01:25:29,759
Hallway.

1458
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:32,992
Hallway clear.

1459
01:25:32,993 --> 01:25:35,696
On the left.

1460
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,830
Clear.

1461
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:39,800
All clear.

1462
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,837
All clear.

1463
01:25:45,838 --> 01:25:47,672
Hey, Marc.

1464
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:49,175
Looks like someone left in a hurry.

1465
01:25:49,176 --> 01:25:51,382
Huh?

1466
01:25:56,382 --> 01:25:58,151
- Man down!
- Cover the window!

1467
01:25:58,152 --> 01:26:00,118
Man down!

1468
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:02,365
Cut that window! Cut that window!

1469
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:14,304
Come on, Marc.

1470
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:19,371
Let's go, buddy. I got you, man. I got you.

1471
01:26:19,372 --> 01:26:21,710
Look at me. Look at me.

1472
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,046
I got you.

1473
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:34,823
Marc's gone, bro.

1474
01:26:36,823 --> 01:26:40,358
I got one SEAL down.
I need cabs back immediately.

1475
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:42,229
We gotta fucking move him.

1476
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:53,706
"Glory is something some men chase,

1477
01:26:53,707 --> 01:26:57,410
"and others find themselves stumbling upon

1478
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:59,845
"not expecting to find it.

1479
01:26:59,846 --> 01:27:01,982
"Either way, it is a noble gesture

1480
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:04,751
"that one finds bestowed upon them.

1481
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:08,286
"My question is, when does glory fade away

1482
01:27:08,287 --> 01:27:10,989
"and become a wrongful crusade?

1483
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:13,059
"Or an unjustified means

1484
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:16,662
"by which consumes one completely?

1485
01:27:16,663 --> 01:27:18,999
"I've...

01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,867
"Seen war...

1487
01:27:21,868 --> 01:27:24,103
"And I've seen...

1488
01:27:24,104 --> 01:27:25,639
Death."

1489
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,342
Detail. Ten-hut!

1490
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:32,612
Port arms!

1491
01:27:32,613 --> 01:27:34,947
Ready!

1492
01:27:34,948 --> 01:27:36,249
Aim.

1493
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,251
Fire!

1494
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:40,152
Ready.

1495
01:27:40,153 --> 01:27:41,287
Aim.

1496
01:27:41,288 --> 01:27:42,355
Fire!

1497
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,023
Ready.

1498
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:46,126
Aim.

1499
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:48,027
Fire!

1500
01:27:48,028 --> 01:27:51,131
Present arms!

1501
01:28:43,783 --> 01:28:47,956
Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago.

1502
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,194
Did he say any of that to<i> you?</i>

1503
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:03,536
Chris, I wanna know what
you thought of his letter.

1504
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:07,306
An aqi informant had called in a tip,

1505
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:09,908
and, uh, Biggles had just been shot.

1506
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:11,411
We were operating out of emotion,

1507
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:14,546
and we just walked right into an ambush.

1508
01:29:14,547 --> 01:29:17,515
But that's not what killed him.

1509
01:29:17,516 --> 01:29:18,952
That letter did.

1510
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:20,385
That letter killed Marc.

1511
01:29:20,386 --> 01:29:25,969
He just...
he let go, and he paid the price for it.

1512
01:29:35,969 --> 01:29:37,315
Sign in here?

1513
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:50,183
Hey, buddy.

1514
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,884
- Hey, Chris?
- Yeah.

1515
01:29:51,885 --> 01:29:54,286
- Where you at, man?
- I'm right here. I'm right here.

1516
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:56,121
Shit, you're blind as a bat.

1517
01:29:56,122 --> 01:29:57,475
Yeah, it fucking blows.

1518
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:00,993
They say they're gonna fix my face, though.

1519
01:30:00,994 --> 01:30:02,129
Oh, thank God.

1520
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,063
About time. Your face needs some fixing.

1521
01:30:04,064 --> 01:30:05,398
It's too soon, man.

1522
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:06,698
It is too soon?

1523
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:08,134
<i>Way</i> too soon.

1524
01:30:08,135 --> 01:30:10,069
Hey, I heard you proposed.

1525
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,237
Yeah.

1526
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:12,272
Well, good for you.

1527
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,706
Mm-hmm.

1528
01:30:13,707 --> 01:30:14,974
You didn't tell her you
bought that diamond, uh...

1529
01:30:14,975 --> 01:30:16,542
you told her you bought it at Zales, right?

1530
01:30:16,543 --> 01:30:17,876
- No.
- You didn't?

1531
01:30:17,877 --> 01:30:20,112
No. No, got a new one.

1532
01:30:20,113 --> 01:30:22,681
It's a smaller one.
Her dad helped me out with it.

1533
01:30:22,682 --> 01:30:24,349
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

1534
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:26,185
- Oh, good.
- Uh-huh.

1535
01:30:26,186 --> 01:30:28,056
She wouldn't leave me, bro.

1536
01:30:30,056 --> 01:30:32,591
I told her to go, and she wouldn't leave.

1537
01:30:33,894 --> 01:30:36,461
She's getting a raw fucking deal.

1538
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:38,697
Why would you say that?

1539
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:41,270
don't say that. She's got<i> you.</i>

1540
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:44,837
All two inches of you.

1541
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:47,340
Two inches.

1542
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:51,410
Yeah, you know,
I'm glad this happened to<i> me</i> and not<i> you.</i>

1543
01:30:51,411 --> 01:30:53,380
Ain't no way you coulda handled it.

1544
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,046
Yeah, you're probably right.

1545
01:30:55,047 --> 01:30:57,282
So they say you're the deadliest sniper

1546
01:30:57,283 --> 01:30:59,019
in U.S. military history.

1547
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,219
Oh, is that right?

1548
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,724
That's what I heard.

1549
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:06,291
The bad guys ended up in Sadr city.

1550
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:07,760
You're not going back.

1551
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:09,728
Yeah, we are.
We're gonna wall 'em in and hunt 'em down.

1552
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:11,429
Nah, come on, man. You
don't have to do that.

1553
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:13,299
Oh, we<i> have</i> to do that.

1554
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,768
You're my brother.

1555
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:17,946
And they're gonna fucking pay
for what they did to you.

1556
01:31:19,238 --> 01:31:21,573
Hooyah, legend.

1557
01:31:21,574 --> 01:31:23,113
Fucking hooyah.

1558
01:31:29,248 --> 01:31:31,384
Something happens to me,

1559
01:31:31,385 --> 01:31:33,819
you'd be all right.

1560
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:36,725
You'd find someone else.

1561
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:41,193
Do you<i> wanna</i> die?

1562
01:31:41,194 --> 01:31:43,563
Is that what it is?

1563
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:45,665
No.

1564
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,666
Then just tell me.

1565
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:50,603
Tell me why you do it.

1566
01:31:50,604 --> 01:31:51,938
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna understand.

1567
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:53,505
Babe, I do it for<i> you.</i> You know that.

1568
01:31:53,506 --> 01:31:54,707
I do it to protect you.

1569
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,675
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1570
01:31:56,676 --> 01:31:59,645
I'm<i> here.</i> Your family is here.

1571
01:31:59,646 --> 01:32:01,112
Your children have no father.

1572
01:32:01,113 --> 01:32:03,014
Well, I have to serve my country.

1573
01:32:03,015 --> 01:32:05,017
That is such fucking bullshit!

1574
01:32:05,018 --> 01:32:06,085
No, it's not.

1575
01:32:06,086 --> 01:32:08,587
You don't know when to quit.

1576
01:32:08,588 --> 01:32:11,389
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough.

1577
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:12,992
You let somebody else go.

1578
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:14,827
- Let somebody else go?
- Yeah.

1579
01:32:14,828 --> 01:32:16,094
Babe, I couldn't live with myself.

1580
01:32:16,095 --> 01:32:18,296
Yeah, well, you find a way.

1581
01:32:18,297 --> 01:32:19,570
You<i> have</i> to.

1582
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,572
Okay, I need you...

1583
01:32:26,573 --> 01:32:30,309
To be human again.

1584
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:32,180
I need you here.

1585
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:37,452
Baby, I need you here.

1586
01:32:39,452 --> 01:32:42,755
If you leave again...

1587
01:32:42,756 --> 01:32:45,404
I don't think we'll be here
when you get back.

1588
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,743
Come here.

1589
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:12,885
Chris.

1590
01:33:12,886 --> 01:33:14,353
Oh, man.

1591
01:33:14,354 --> 01:33:17,890
We've been shot off position
three nights in a row, man.

1592
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:20,158
Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.

1593
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,028
This shit is fucking biblical, Chris.

1594
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,795
Is there any other punishers here?

1595
01:33:23,796 --> 01:33:25,999
Squirrel cycled out.

1596
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,599
And Dauber was coming back,
but his wife knocked him up.

1597
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,134
And if I bring home another rug,

1598
01:33:29,135 --> 01:33:31,703
my wife'll murder my motherfucking ass,
Chris.

1599
01:33:31,704 --> 01:33:34,139
- Teams and shit, right?
- Teams and shit.

1600
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,942
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man.

1601
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:37,876
Oh, man, I went to see him
in the hospital before I left.

1602
01:33:37,877 --> 01:33:40,513
Motherfucker can't see shit.

1603
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,516
Biggles is gone, Chris.

1604
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:45,018
He was in surgery yesterday,

1605
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:47,927
and, um, he died on that table.

1606
01:33:54,927 --> 01:33:56,595
<i>Hey, this is Taya.</i>

1607
01:33:56,596 --> 01:33:58,730
<i>I can't get to the phone,
so please leave a message.</i>

1608
01:33:58,731 --> 01:34:00,233
It's me, uh...

1609
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:02,117
Just calling to hear your voice.

1610
01:34:02,969 --> 01:34:04,437
I'm missing you guys.

1611
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,005
Been thinking about some things you said.

1612
01:34:07,006 --> 01:34:09,675
Tell the kids I love 'em.

1613
01:34:09,676 --> 01:34:11,585
I love you, too.

1614
01:35:18,845 --> 01:35:20,048
don't pick it up.

1615
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,221
don't you fucking pick it up.

1616
01:35:31,557 --> 01:35:33,331
Son of a bitch.

1617
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:39,778
Fucking drop it.

1618
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:53,649
Drop it, you little cocksucker.

1619
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:24,042
All right, listen up.

1620
01:36:24,043 --> 01:36:26,077
The head-shed believe
this t-wall here will help

1621
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:29,282
win the war by trapping
remaining aqi behind it.

1622
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,283
Problem is the engineers
building the goddamn things

1623
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:33,352
are getting picked off by one single sniper

1624
01:36:33,353 --> 01:36:35,487
- from deep behind the wall.
- How deep?

1625
01:36:35,488 --> 01:36:37,622
Roughly 1,000 meters.

1626
01:36:37,623 --> 01:36:39,457
- Is it Mustafa?
- Mu-who?

1627
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:40,693
I don't know, dude.

1628
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:42,594
The sniper who killed
our fucking friend Biggles, man.

1629
01:36:42,595 --> 01:36:44,729
He can be whoever the fuck
you need him to be.

1630
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:46,331
We just need him dead.

1631
01:36:46,332 --> 01:36:48,099
We'll shuttle you six blocks
north into enemy territory,

1632
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,269
which will put you
right up under the sniper's nose

1633
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,804
when he takes his shot, okay?

1634
01:36:51,805 --> 01:36:53,037
In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?

1635
01:36:53,038 --> 01:36:54,840
Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi.

1636
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:57,108
We need to shut this shooter<i> down.</i>

1637
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:59,011
Understood? Gear up.

1638
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:00,246
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

1639
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,685
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1640
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:26,974
It's clear. Move out.

1641
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,541
It's clear.

1642
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,108
We're maneuver. You're base.

1643
01:39:10,109 --> 01:39:12,044
- Yep.
- Go.

1644
01:39:12,045 --> 01:39:13,351
Go!

1645
01:39:18,351 --> 01:39:19,818
Clear.

1646
01:39:19,819 --> 01:39:21,420
Moving.

1647
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:23,623
Go! Go!

1648
01:39:24,623 --> 01:39:26,625
All clear.

1649
01:39:26,626 --> 01:39:28,328
Set security.

1650
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:10,345
The streets are crawling. Hold your fire.

1651
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:22,208
Enter the fucking sandman.

1652
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:03,117
- Man down!
- Man back!

1653
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:08,693
Shit!

1654
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:12,536
Shot came from the east!

1655
01:41:16,536 --> 01:41:19,537
We set up in the wrong fucking direction.

1656
01:41:19,538 --> 01:41:22,441
Doesn't matter. Hold your fire.

1657
01:41:22,442 --> 01:41:24,483
We got uglies right below us.

1658
01:41:57,243 --> 01:42:00,211
I got something 1,900 yards out.

1659
01:42:00,212 --> 01:42:01,813
Fuck, you can't even see that far out.

1660
01:42:01,814 --> 01:42:04,483
Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.

1661
01:42:04,484 --> 01:42:06,818
He's right, legend. No bueno.

1662
01:42:06,819 --> 01:42:10,390
Correction. It's 2,100 yards out.

1663
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:14,230
That's more than a mile.
Impossible shot, Chris.

1664
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:27,042
It's him.

1665
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,910
This is task unit bruiser.
I got eyes on target.

1666
01:42:31,911 --> 01:42:33,745
Initiate QRF. Over.

1667
01:42:33,746 --> 01:42:34,880
Copy that.

1668
01:42:34,881 --> 01:42:37,498
ET on quick reaction
force is 20 minutes out.

1669
01:42:52,498 --> 01:42:54,232
He has eyes on our guys.

1670
01:42:54,233 --> 01:42:56,637
Can you confirm it's him?

1671
01:42:58,637 --> 01:43:00,671
It's him.

1672
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:02,439
Oh, it's him.

1673
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,709
It's your call, Chris.

1674
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:06,010
Quick reaction force is 20 minutes out.

1675
01:43:06,011 --> 01:43:07,600
You'll stand the fuck down!

1676
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:22,863
If you got it, take it, man.

1677
01:43:24,863 --> 01:43:28,300
Aim small, miss small.

1678
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:30,403
Do it for Biggles.

1679
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:06,742
You just fucked us, legend.

1680
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,276
Tango down.

1681
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:12,947
We need QRF asap!

1682
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,550
Mission accomplished.

1683
01:44:18,551 --> 01:44:20,952
He had eyes on our guys.

1684
01:44:20,953 --> 01:44:22,420
And I took him out.

1685
01:44:22,421 --> 01:44:25,658
Yeah. Now we're fucked like a football bat.

1686
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,064
Biggles would be proud.

1687
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:33,168
You did it, Chris.

1688
01:44:36,168 --> 01:44:37,736
Echo 7 kilo, be advised

1689
01:44:37,737 --> 01:44:39,638
you have enemy approaching
all directions of your pos.

1690
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:42,608
White-side! Goddamn it, legend. Fuck!

1691
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:45,113
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

1692
01:44:50,316 --> 01:44:52,785
All right, I see two ways up onto the roof.

1693
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:54,385
We wanna lock both staircases.

1694
01:44:54,386 --> 01:44:55,659
Conserve ammo.

1695
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:28,980
Get some, motherfuckers.

1696
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,480
Echo 7 kilo,

1697
01:45:56,481 --> 01:45:59,011
you have tango-heavy gun
on your green-side.

1698
01:46:39,859 --> 01:46:42,394
We're taking effective fire, white-side!

1699
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:45,171
Effective fire, white-side!

1700
01:46:53,171 --> 01:46:55,706
"D", I'm down to two mags! We gotta move!

1701
01:46:55,707 --> 01:46:58,612
don't stop fucking shooting, man!

1702
01:46:59,612 --> 01:47:01,318
QRF's stuck three blocks out.

1703
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:14,326
I'm out!

1704
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:15,794
3 o'clock. Loading last mag.

1705
01:47:15,795 --> 01:47:18,630
I've only got one mag left!

1706
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,232
I'm black! I'm black!

1707
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:21,566
Anybody got a mag?!

1708
01:47:21,567 --> 01:47:24,001
We can't hold 'em any longer!
We gotta move!

1709
01:47:24,002 --> 01:47:25,537
Those guys are sitting ducks.

1710
01:47:25,538 --> 01:47:27,840
I don't wanna get dragged in the street.

1711
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:29,675
That's it. Do it.

1712
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:31,210
Call it in.

1713
01:47:31,211 --> 01:47:33,711
This is Rio 2 Bravo
requesting ordnance drop.

1714
01:47:33,712 --> 01:47:36,749
Grid number 04837959.

1715
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,617
That target location is<i> your</i> position.

1716
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:39,850
I know my fucking position!

1717
01:47:39,851 --> 01:47:41,687
They're right on top of us. Just drop it!

1718
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:43,855
Viper 34, move to final attack heading.

1719
01:47:43,856 --> 01:47:48,570
Viper 34. Roger. 30 seconds out.

1720
01:47:58,570 --> 01:48:00,074
Hello?

1721
01:48:02,074 --> 01:48:03,442
Baby?

1722
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:04,643
Chris?

1723
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:06,879
Baby, I ca... baby, I can't hear you.

1724
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,647
Hello?

1725
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:10,916
I'm ready.

1726
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:13,551
I'm ready to come home.

1727
01:48:13,552 --> 01:48:15,689
What?

1728
01:48:17,689 --> 01:48:19,724
I have the building in sight.

1729
01:48:19,725 --> 01:48:22,962
What's happening?

1730
01:48:25,064 --> 01:48:27,633
I'm ready to come home, baby.

1731
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:29,404
Chris?

1732
01:48:32,404 --> 01:48:34,473
It's pretty bad air up here.

1733
01:48:34,474 --> 01:48:35,974
I can't hold this much longer.

1734
01:48:35,975 --> 01:48:37,643
Tell the pilot "turn it loose."

1735
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:40,684
Viper 34. Fire away.

1736
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:45,684
Target missed.

1737
01:48:49,421 --> 01:48:51,622
Shit.

1738
01:48:51,623 --> 01:48:53,558
We need to exfil now!

1739
01:48:53,559 --> 01:48:55,793
Let's go! Let's move!

1740
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:02,908
We gotta move!

1741
01:49:09,908 --> 01:49:13,614
Echo 7 kilo, green-side is clear for exit.

1742
01:49:16,614 --> 01:49:18,349
I got the out.

1743
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:20,121
Green-side pole on my go!

1744
01:49:22,121 --> 01:49:24,622
They're on the roof.

1745
01:49:24,623 --> 01:49:26,201
Let's go!

1746
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:46,261
Last man!

1747
01:50:05,364 --> 01:50:06,478
Get to the back!

1748
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:20,511
Go! Go! Go!

1749
01:50:20,512 --> 01:50:21,746
Come on! Inside, inside!

1750
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:23,047
- Come on, let's go!
- Get in the truck!

1751
01:50:23,048 --> 01:50:25,048
Get in the truck now! We got to go!

1752
01:50:37,662 --> 01:50:39,531
Come on! We got to get out now!

1753
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:41,433
Let me up.

1754
01:50:41,434 --> 01:50:44,037
Come on, let me up. Come on.

1755
01:50:46,037 --> 01:50:48,340
Where's Chris? Huh?

1756
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:50,812
He was just behind me. Where is Chris, man?

1757
01:50:52,811 --> 01:50:54,818
Open the fucking door.

1758
01:50:58,818 --> 01:51:00,588
Stop the goddamn rig!

1759
01:51:03,588 --> 01:51:05,023
Where is he?! Chris!

1760
01:51:05,024 --> 01:51:07,158
- Chris!
- Chris, come on!

1761
01:51:07,159 --> 01:51:08,093
Come on!

1762
01:51:08,094 --> 01:51:10,129
Hold the fucking vehicle, man!

1763
01:51:10,130 --> 01:51:11,729
We can't leave you! Come on, Chris!

1764
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:14,431
Grab my hand! Come on! Chris!

1765
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,034
Pull him in now!

1766
01:51:19,837 --> 01:51:22,408
Come on, Chris!

1767
01:51:52,572 --> 01:51:55,306
<i>...with a nice pass as Brandon Wallace,</i>

1768
01:51:55,307 --> 01:51:57,309
<i>penetration, draw defenders...</i>

1769
01:51:57,310 --> 01:52:01,212
<i>And then leave it for Balkman
in perfect scoring position.</i>

1770
01:52:01,213 --> 01:52:03,749
<i>And moss commits back-to-back fouls</i>

1771
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:05,884
<i>and has three now in the game.</i>

1772
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:08,153
<i>The first player with three.</i>

1773
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:11,089
<i>Renaldo Balkman, that
big smile, so engaging.</i>

1774
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:12,823
<i>He's a big fan favorite.</i>

1775
01:52:12,824 --> 01:52:15,626
<i>He's got the Balkman buddies
in their t-shirts behind us</i>

1776
01:52:15,627 --> 01:52:18,530
<i>cheering his every move.</i>

1777
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:34,379
Yeah?

1778
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:35,880
Hey, it's me.

1779
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:37,114
I just... I got this weird message

1780
01:52:37,115 --> 01:52:39,117
that you were on a plane or something?

1781
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:41,919
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got out early.

1782
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,889
You did?

1783
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:46,491
So, what, are you in Germany, or... where?

1784
01:52:46,492 --> 01:52:47,626
No, I'm here.

1785
01:52:47,627 --> 01:52:50,528
I'm, uh...

1786
01:52:50,529 --> 01:52:52,496
I'm stateside.

1787
01:52:52,497 --> 01:52:55,300
You're home?

1788
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:58,404
What... what are you doing?

1789
01:53:02,274 --> 01:53:05,078
I guess I just needed a minute.

1790
01:53:07,078 --> 01:53:10,547
Chris, the... the kids
are dying to see you.

1791
01:53:10,548 --> 01:53:13,222
It's been nine months.

1792
01:53:19,992 --> 01:53:22,827
I'm coming home.

1793
01:53:22,828 --> 01:53:25,395
Are you all right?

1794
01:53:25,396 --> 01:53:26,698
Yeah, I'm good.

1795
01:53:29,768 --> 01:53:33,004
Babe, come home. Okay?

1796
01:53:33,005 --> 01:53:37,278
You know, we... we miss you.

1797
01:53:39,278 --> 01:53:40,654
Okay.

1798
01:53:52,091 --> 01:53:55,894
<i>Sparks inside and scores.</i>

1799
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:57,862
<i>It's Kentucky by five.</i>

1800
01:53:57,863 --> 01:54:01,400
<i>Seven points for sparks.</i>

1801
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:22,688
Hey, Chris?

1802
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:24,127
Babe.

1803
01:54:31,863 --> 01:54:34,136
Hon, I'm... I'm going outside.

1804
01:54:42,774 --> 01:54:44,209
- Get it.
- Higher.

1805
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:46,799
Look at you. I can see
your face again, babe.

1806
01:54:47,567 --> 01:54:48,979
- Looks good.
- Oh, good.

1807
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:51,249
Looks different.

1808
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:53,451
So the game's this Saturday.

1809
01:54:53,452 --> 01:54:56,219
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team.

1810
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,689
Doctor said he could be 6'4".

1811
01:54:58,690 --> 01:55:00,524
- Isn't that insane?
- Mm.

1812
01:55:00,525 --> 01:55:02,160
I can't wait for you to see him play.

1813
01:55:02,161 --> 01:55:04,261
I go so crazy, though,
when the other kids jump on him.

1814
01:55:04,262 --> 01:55:06,163
Like, I need you there as, like, a leveler,

1815
01:55:06,164 --> 01:55:08,500
you know what I mean?

1816
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:11,872
Hey, maybe you could even coach, you know?

1817
01:55:13,472 --> 01:55:15,206
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth,

1818
01:55:15,207 --> 01:55:16,974
and I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it,

1819
01:55:16,975 --> 01:55:18,408
like, in her sleep or something.

1820
01:55:18,409 --> 01:55:21,112
And she said she'd let you pull it,
but<i> only</i> you.

1821
01:55:21,113 --> 01:55:23,082
Would you do that?

1822
01:55:40,065 --> 01:55:41,867
Chris!

1823
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:58,683
I got a very interesting phone call.

1824
01:55:58,684 --> 01:55:59,885
It's from your wife.

1825
01:55:59,886 --> 01:56:02,154
She told me about the barbecue.

1826
01:56:03,354 --> 01:56:05,389
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah.

1827
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:07,626
Things seem like
they got a little out of hand.

1828
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:08,926
Are<i> you</i> worried?

1829
01:56:08,927 --> 01:56:10,161
Uh, no, sir.

1830
01:56:10,162 --> 01:56:12,229
So you're not worried about what happened,

1831
01:56:12,230 --> 01:56:14,099
or what<i> might</i> happen?

1832
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:16,869
No, sir, I'm not worried about that.

1833
01:56:17,869 --> 01:56:20,071
Let me ask you a question, Chris.

1834
01:56:20,072 --> 01:56:22,540
How much time did you spend in-country?

1835
01:56:22,541 --> 01:56:25,443
Uh, well, four tours, so...

1836
01:56:25,444 --> 01:56:27,245
That's like, what, 1,000 days?

1837
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:29,447
Yeah, sounds about right.

1838
01:56:29,448 --> 01:56:31,616
Would you be surprised if I told you

1839
01:56:31,617 --> 01:56:35,385
that the Navy has credited you
with over 160 kills?

1840
01:56:35,386 --> 01:56:37,354
Mm.

1841
01:56:37,355 --> 01:56:41,425
Do you ever think
that you might have seen things

1842
01:56:41,426 --> 01:56:44,694
or done some things over there
that you wish you hadn't?

1843
01:56:44,695 --> 01:56:47,197
Oh, that's not me. No.

1844
01:56:47,198 --> 01:56:48,899
<i>What's</i> not you?

1845
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,300
I was just protecting my guys.

1846
01:56:50,301 --> 01:56:52,170
They were trying to kill our soldiers,

1847
01:56:52,171 --> 01:56:54,572
and, uh, I'm willing to meet my creator

1848
01:56:54,573 --> 01:56:57,478
and answer for every shot that I took.

1849
01:56:59,478 --> 01:57:03,180
The thing that, uh... Haunts me

1850
01:57:03,181 --> 01:57:05,952
are all the guys that I<i> couldn't</i> save.

1851
01:57:06,952 --> 01:57:10,287
You know, I'm willing and able to be there,
but I'm not.

1852
01:57:10,288 --> 01:57:12,525
I'm here. I quit.

1853
01:57:13,525 --> 01:57:15,878
So you wish you could've saved more guys?

1854
01:57:17,162 --> 01:57:18,898
Yes, sir.

1855
01:57:19,898 --> 01:57:23,634
You know, you can walk down
any hall in this hospital.

1856
01:57:23,635 --> 01:57:26,641
We got plenty of soldiers need saving.

1857
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:31,309
Mm-hmm.

1858
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:33,778
Wanna take a walk?

1859
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:35,679
Sure.

1860
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:36,982
All right.

1861
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:38,572
I wanna show you something.

1862
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:43,721
I still smoke.

1863
01:57:43,722 --> 01:57:45,389
Can't be too mad at it

1864
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:47,258
'cause it kinda saved my right hand.

1865
01:57:47,259 --> 01:57:48,492
How so?

1866
01:57:48,493 --> 01:57:51,028
When I got blown up, I had both of my hands

1867
01:57:51,029 --> 01:57:53,130
on the bottom of the steering wheel.

1868
01:57:53,131 --> 01:57:55,265
And right before the explosion went off,

1869
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:56,501
I took my hand off,

1870
01:57:56,502 --> 01:57:58,536
grabbed a cigarette, stuck it in my mouth.

1871
01:57:58,537 --> 01:58:01,739
And when I went to go light it,
the explosion happened.

1872
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:05,010
And it took the whole bottom
of the steering wheel

1873
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:06,310
and my left hand off.

1874
01:58:06,311 --> 01:58:08,411
And I was lucky that I had this.

1875
01:58:08,412 --> 01:58:11,483
I mean,
it still fucked up my right hand, but...

1876
01:58:11,484 --> 01:58:13,151
- Yeah.
- ...I still got it.

1877
01:58:13,152 --> 01:58:14,518
And you still smoke?

1878
01:58:14,519 --> 01:58:16,555
Yeah, I still smoke.

1879
01:58:23,328 --> 01:58:25,362
Miss. Three inches to the right.

1880
01:58:25,363 --> 01:58:28,633
Come on, Wynn. You can do better than that.

1881
01:58:28,634 --> 01:58:31,336
Bring this to the right.

1882
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:33,304
Make sure you keep both eyes open.

1883
01:58:33,305 --> 01:58:34,971
Let that trigger surprise you.

1884
01:58:34,972 --> 01:58:37,707
We're not shooting bad guys.
We're shooting paper.

1885
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:39,609
How about the legend stops
trying to fuck up my shot?

1886
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:42,022
- How about that?
- How about you hit one?

1887
01:58:43,215 --> 01:58:44,715
- Hit!
- There you go.

1888
01:58:44,716 --> 01:58:46,416
Bull's eye, boy.

1889
01:58:46,417 --> 01:58:49,953
Damn, if that don't feel
like I got my balls back.

1890
01:58:49,954 --> 01:58:53,023
Why you spending all
this time with us, man?

1891
01:58:53,024 --> 01:58:54,992
I know you got a family.

1892
01:58:54,993 --> 01:58:58,095
I heard you had a boot
collection before the war?

1893
01:58:58,096 --> 01:59:01,155
So I was thinking,
I saw we were about the same size.

1894
01:59:01,432 --> 01:59:04,301
Seriously, man. Why do you do it?

1895
01:59:04,302 --> 01:59:06,836
Well, we take care of each other, right?

1896
01:59:06,837 --> 01:59:09,774
Let's see if you can't hit two in a row.

1897
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:12,744
Come on, man. You got this.

1898
01:59:14,246 --> 01:59:15,351
- Hit!
- Nice.

1899
01:59:20,351 --> 01:59:21,786
- Hit!
- Whoo!

1900
01:59:21,787 --> 01:59:23,821
Goddamn.

1901
01:59:23,822 --> 01:59:25,591
Who's the legend now?

1902
01:59:26,757 --> 01:59:28,858
That's a title you don't want.

1903
01:59:28,859 --> 01:59:30,061
Trust me.

1904
01:59:35,466 --> 01:59:37,996
Yo, will you hop down?
I'll give 'em to you.

1905
01:59:40,706 --> 01:59:42,206
You add one more?

1906
01:59:42,207 --> 01:59:43,608
Yeah.

1907
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:45,609
All right, take 'em inside.

1908
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:46,734
All right.

1909
02:00:08,734 --> 02:00:10,135
Come here.

1910
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:16,506
It's not a bad life out here, is it?

1911
02:00:16,507 --> 02:00:18,509
Got a smile on his face.

1912
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:20,279
Looks cheery to me.

1913
02:00:21,546 --> 02:00:24,149
Just doing his thing.

1914
02:00:25,984 --> 02:00:28,087
Wave goodbye to him.

1915
02:00:36,828 --> 02:00:39,496
Oh! Fuck, who is that?!

1916
02:00:39,497 --> 02:00:41,299
Oh! Babe, is that you?

1917
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:42,567
Yep-A-Doo-Dee!

1918
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:44,167
Oh, baby, I fucking hurt myself.

1919
02:00:44,168 --> 02:00:45,403
- Shit.
- What?

1920
02:00:45,404 --> 02:00:47,170
No, I'm all right. I'm all right!

1921
02:00:47,171 --> 02:00:48,773
I'm all right. Fuck.

1922
02:00:48,774 --> 02:00:50,375
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1923
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:52,108
What happened? Don't...

1924
02:00:52,109 --> 02:00:53,179
aah!

1925
02:00:54,779 --> 02:00:58,750
You know that it's a heck of a
thing to stop a beating heart.

1926
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:00,050
Yeah.

1927
02:01:00,051 --> 02:01:03,386
That's why we're gonna do it
together for your first time.

1928
02:01:03,387 --> 02:01:05,221
All right.

1929
02:01:05,222 --> 02:01:08,192
Now, remember, you gotta be calm...

1930
02:01:08,193 --> 02:01:10,428
Confident...

1931
02:01:10,429 --> 02:01:13,330
And you never hesitate.

1932
02:01:13,331 --> 02:01:14,532
All right.

1933
02:01:14,533 --> 02:01:15,866
You got it, bubba?

1934
02:01:15,867 --> 02:01:16,934
I got it.

1935
02:01:16,935 --> 02:01:18,036
You feel good?

1936
02:01:18,037 --> 02:01:20,341
Yeah.

1937
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:25,747
- Shh.
- Shh.

1938
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,821
Hands in the air, little lady.

1939
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:39,456
Hands in the air.

1940
02:01:39,457 --> 02:01:42,293
Now, you drop them drawers.

1941
02:01:43,895 --> 02:01:47,163
But you drop 'em nice and easy.

1942
02:01:47,164 --> 02:01:50,201
Oh, baby, look at you.

1943
02:01:50,202 --> 02:01:51,435
Look at<i> you.</i>

1944
02:01:51,436 --> 02:01:53,036
Look at you.

1945
02:01:53,037 --> 02:01:54,572
Can I tell you something?

1946
02:01:54,573 --> 02:01:56,674
Tell it to the judge.

1947
02:01:56,675 --> 02:01:58,276
Stop it.

1948
02:01:58,277 --> 02:02:01,411
No. I am so proud of you,
and I don't tell you enough.

1949
02:02:01,412 --> 02:02:02,714
I'm so proud of you.

1950
02:02:02,715 --> 02:02:04,616
And you're such a great father.

1951
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:08,853
And I am so happy
that I've got my husband back.

1952
02:02:08,854 --> 02:02:11,619
And I also know how hard
you fought to get here.

1953
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:16,961
You're worth fighting for.

1954
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:18,429
Now tell me one other thing.

1955
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:20,598
Did you... did you pleat those jeans?

1956
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:23,233
Yes, ma'am.
I believe they're right down the middle.

1957
02:02:23,234 --> 02:02:25,336
Oh, you're just a regular old cowboy again.

1958
02:02:25,337 --> 02:02:26,871
Mm-hmm. That's right. Now, why don't you...

1959
02:02:26,872 --> 02:02:28,538
why don't you<i> really</i> drop them drawers?

1960
02:02:28,539 --> 02:02:31,108
I'm not wearing any drawers, baby.

1961
02:02:31,109 --> 02:02:32,542
I got four minutes.

1962
02:02:32,543 --> 02:02:34,879
Is that all it takes?

1963
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,480
No, it takes<i> two</i> minutes.

1964
02:02:36,481 --> 02:02:39,083
But then I want two minutes to look at you.

1965
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:42,286
Aren't you going to the range?

1966
02:02:42,287 --> 02:02:44,455
Who are you taking out?

1967
02:02:44,456 --> 02:02:47,157
This marine. His mama kept asking me.

1968
02:02:47,158 --> 02:02:48,926
She parks cars at the elementary school,

1969
02:02:48,927 --> 02:02:50,693
and she said, "can you help out my son?"

1970
02:02:50,694 --> 02:02:52,196
And I just thought...

1971
02:02:52,197 --> 02:02:54,130
Today's the only day I can really do it,
so...

1972
02:02:54,131 --> 02:02:56,466
It's gonna be just a little bit
of the afternoon. I'll be back.

1973
02:02:56,467 --> 02:02:58,935
Yes!

1974
02:02:58,936 --> 02:03:00,737
- You make sure you keep them drawers...
- daddy.

1975
02:03:00,738 --> 02:03:02,439
- What's up? What's up?
- Dad, you wanna play Skylanders?

1976
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,974
Uh, no, I can't play right now.

1977
02:03:03,975 --> 02:03:05,977
I'll do it when I get back, boy.

1978
02:03:05,978 --> 02:03:07,946
But, see, you're on level 8,
and that doesn't work.

1979
02:03:07,947 --> 02:03:09,813
I gotta be on level 4. And I don't want...

1980
02:03:09,814 --> 02:03:11,448
I wanna win. You gotta let me win.

1981
02:03:11,449 --> 02:03:12,649
No way!

1982
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:14,885
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?

1983
02:03:14,886 --> 02:03:16,386
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?!

1984
02:03:16,387 --> 02:03:18,390
Poke the bear!

1985
02:03:19,591 --> 02:03:21,650
No! You're supposed to roar, like...

1986
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:23,161
Like what?

1987
02:03:23,395 --> 02:03:25,160
Like a beast, right? Like what?

1988
02:03:29,833 --> 02:03:31,102
Ooh.

1989
02:03:31,103 --> 02:03:33,470
All right, bubba.
Y'all look after our women, okay?

1990
02:03:33,471 --> 02:03:34,671
Yeah.

1991
02:03:34,672 --> 02:03:36,540
Okay. It's a big responsibility.

1992
02:03:36,541 --> 02:03:37,943
You up for it?

1993
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:40,277
All right.

1994
02:03:40,278 --> 02:03:41,312
See you later, baby.

1995
02:03:41,313 --> 02:03:42,379
Mm-hmm. I love you.

1996
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:43,886
I love you back.

1997
02:03:48,886 --> 02:03:51,022
How are you? You good?

1998
02:03:51,023 --> 02:03:52,355
Good.

1999
02:03:52,356 --> 02:03:53,957
We're gonna go about a two-hour
drive and shoot some guns

2000
02:03:53,958 --> 02:03:55,459
and maybe have a little
conversation along the way.

2001
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,961
- What you say?
- Yeah.

2002
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:58,496
All right. Let's go.

2003
02:03:58,497 --> 02:04:00,029
- Thank you.
- Yep.

2004
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:02,666
Hey, you eat yet? You hungry?

2005
02:04:02,667 --> 02:04:04,726
You wanna get something on the way?
