He fell ,

10
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:44,345
Just a moment , There are women and children , the distance of 200 meters , moving towards the convoy ,

11
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,418
His arm is not moving , He was carrying something ,

12
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:05,390
He took out a grenade , LLR grenade Russia , I think I gave it to the boy ,

13
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:10,304
- Women and children ? - Have you seen him ? It can provide ?

Back here ,

18
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,509
Never leave your gun on the ground ,

19
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,510
Ya , then ,

00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:11,457
One day you will be a great hunter ,

22
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:18,406
Listen to this book , several times , This judgment ,,

23
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,502
for what he believes ,

24
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,441
Time in which we have to do , We can not see with your eyes ,

25
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,282
So , we do not know the glory of their plans ,

26
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:34,285
Our eyes see it as a reflection in the glass ,

27
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,289
- The day we arrived ,,, - Why are you doing ?

28
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:43,391
We will see it clearly , I understand that mystery ,

29
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,459
Let us pray ,

30
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:48,528
There are three types of people in this world ,

31
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,507
Sheep, Wolf and Sheepdog ,

32
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,534
Some people believe

33
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,504
hell no to a world

34
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:02,478
And if hatred arises in the door I do not know how to protect yourself ,

35
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,445
It's a sheep ,

36
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:09,354
Then there are the predators , They use violence

37
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,382
that prey on the weak ,

38
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,291
They wolves ,

39
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,261
Then there are those

40
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,456

41
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,428
and protect the flock ,

42
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,499
They are a rare breed who live in the face serigala--

43
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,410
They Shepherd ,

44
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,516
We do not raise sheep in this family

45
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:39,387
and I will menghajarjika you become a wolf , - Wayne--

46
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:46,260
However , we protect our herd ,

47
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,398
And if someone tried to fight

48
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,335
or to protect your sister and get my permission to complete,

49
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,395

You know your goals ,

54
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,370
There is no one there ,

55
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,515
You can come out with a waist belt ,

56
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:17,275

Enemy snipers lurking ,

329
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,467
Yes , it will not happen again ,

330
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:18,467
It should not happen again , There is a hot entrusted quarter of a mile away ,

331
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,413
I will make a report ,

332
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,315
- How much did you get ? Can be six ,

333
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:26,480
No, I can be eight , but they pulled out two people ,

334
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:30,322
- You can be six ? - Yes , why ?

335
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:34,316
- You can be more than the others , - Yes , but they can be one of us ,

336
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,387
You can not hit what you can not see ,

337
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:42,468
- His wife said that the Qu'ran , I do not know the form of the Qur'an ,

338
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,461
But I can not describe what you are wearing ,

339
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:49,273
Metal items , firing bullets 7,62 , and looks like AK -47s,

340
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:51,244
So what he brings ?

341
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:03,481
He came ,

342
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:09,292
Ladies and gentlemen , listen up, There is a legend among us ,

343
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:12,489
Give him exciting applause ,

344
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,370
Legend is already making a record , He killed 100 people with one shot ,

345
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:23,502
One bullet man ,

346
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,536
He is the \" stroke \" , \" 100 people ,

347
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:30,245
And he once again ,

348
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,481
Oh My ,

349
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:35,478
Competition throwing food ? Come on ,

350
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,357
The only way to shut up ,

351
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,396
Did you kill people ?

352
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,264
No way to start a conversation , darling ,

353
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:50,530
Do not act as if it was for me ,

354
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,430
I want you to tell me everything ,

355
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:57,368
There are some things that can not be said on the phone ,

356
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:02,415
You get me pregnant , and I was sitting I put cots ,,,

357
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,508
,,, And you can not talk to me ?

358
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,453
That's your big plan?

359
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:10,481
It's all right there?

360
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,294
I can not stop thinking about pink dress ,

361
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:19,298
His name evening dress ,

362
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,324
I,

363
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:26,496
Three days does not count as a honeymoon ,

364
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,304
It was three days of fun ,

365
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:38,314
-I Miss you , Yes Have you missed ,

366
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:43,516
- You want to talk naughty with you ? - Yes , wait a minute ,

367
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:52,288
I was holding a rifle ,

368
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:55,427
You must decide what is more important , dear ,

369
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:59,270
You really lust ,

370
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:02,275
I 'm fat and horny , It's disgusting,

371
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:05,445
Although weight is 150 pounds , I still want to make love to you ,

372
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,510
- Really romantic, - What about my son ?

373
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:15,445
- Nobody said it was a man , - You two would be amazing ,

374
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:17,517
How do you know ?

375
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,387
I know , I can see it ,

376
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,558
- I hope you're right , I'm right,

377
00:37:29,536 --> 00:37:33,472
-Ayahmu Contact you ? No, Check your e - mail ,

378
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:35,407
Oh My ,

379
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:37,502
You ought to call it , right?

380
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,513
What's wrong ? I do not think straight ,

381
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:43,448
What's wrong ?

382
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:49,388
- Your brother is sent , What do you think? At school ?

383
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,484
No, he did not go to school , Just call your father ,

384
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,427
What do you think ? Where is she ?

385
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,457
Healthy ,

386
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,528
He heads the Iraqis ,

387
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,495
Sorry , dear ,

388
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:12,478
The man who held the knife was a member of the radical Bin Laden financed Jordan ,

389
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:16,313
Trained Bin Laden , loyal to bin Laden ,

390
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:19,411
His name was Zarqawi ,

391
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:24,513
Jerk is Prince Al - Qaida in the Iraqis ,

392
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,393
Team , AQL , amounting to 5000 people ,

393
00:38:29,396 --> 00:38:31,455
They are not ordinary mercenary force ,

394
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,296
They are well trained , well paid ,,,

395
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:38,499
,,, And this time , they run the largest assault operation since Vietnam ,

396
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:43,536
Zarqawi and his lieutenant , they are our main priority ,

397
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:46,513
There is only one way to find them ,

398
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:51,246
Ie check from door to door , and we found them ,,,

399
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:54,345
,,, Or someone who can give their position ,

400
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:59,254
So we have to examine 10 objects per hour ,

401
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,557
I know very, very aggressive ,

402
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,293
Do not overly rely on air support ,

403
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:09,292
It is the highest priority targets to date ,

404
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:13,466
I want them dead or captured , you understand?

405
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,273
It was the question ?

406
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:24,340
If the Marines a hurry , they can hit ,

407
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,444
They can not be training like us ,

408
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:28,421
Most of them are civilians 6 months ago ,

409
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:32,324
Let them train , I 'll show you how to them ,

410
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:34,350
No , we need pay attention to the situation ,

411
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:38,388
- The enemy already knows we're there , - Under very dangerous ,

412
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,267
Do you want to be the savior ?

413
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,260
I just wanted to catch them , You can not see , can not shoot ,

414
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:47,432
Everyone knows your name , They feel safe when you are there ,

415
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:50,272
- I do not , - That's what they think ,

416
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:54,346
So , stay there , watching them ,

417
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:08,255
You said snipers AQL attended the Olympics ?

418
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:11,264
While the Iraqis have not qualified for three Olympics ,

419
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:14,291
Mustafa instead of Iraqis ,

420
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,504
He is from Syria ,

421
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:31,382
Once you get in , I could not see anything ,

422
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,478
So , take it easy ,

423
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:36,250
Okay ,

424
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:39,282
Sign up!

425
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,276
To hell with that ,

426
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:01,413
I will go down with the Marines ,

427
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,244
Are you coming ?

428
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,442
No,

429
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:09,388
I want to go home alive ,

430
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:14,486
It is not my job knocking on the door , I do not want to do it ,

431
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:16,520
If you do not see down there ,,,

432
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,432
,,, Make sure you did not see each other again ,

433
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:28,332
Hey , you mind if I come with you ?

434
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,340
Of course ,

435
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:35,540
You're a legend that , right? You killed 24 people ?

436
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:38,342
-I Do not count , - It's really great,

437
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:40,546
It was a black man in pursuit Bravo ,

438
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:43,489
I know a few things ,

439
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,256
There are several things you can show , how ?

440
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:49,453
All right,

441
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:56,361
What does that mean ? - Break ,

442
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,377
Get on the ground now !

443
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,540
- No! - Get down !

444
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,318
Why are you here ? You should have an evacuation ,

445
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:17,323
Who are you ?

446
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:19,554
I do not care about this house ,

447
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,360
This is a war zone , sir , Get down ,

448
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:25,328
Quickly ,

449
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:27,426
They hide behind ,

450
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:31,304
No one else in this house ?

451
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:35,366
He's going to blow up ,

452
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,275
Searched his clothes ,

453
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:40,542
- He knows that we discussed , - Who are you talking about?

454
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:43,414
Who knew we talk ?

455
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:48,354
He cut ,,,

456
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,357
- Please ,,, - Target is already provided ?

457
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:56,419
Okay , take it , Put your hands behind your head ,

458
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,490
Current ! Quick!

459
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,369
Take it to another room ,

460
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,510
When he spoke , a man will come to his house ,

461
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,483
Who is he? ' '

462
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:26,419
Someone called the Butcher , Son of the Devil,

463
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,360
He was a bouncer ?

464
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,355
Zarqawi 's number one soldier ,

465
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,231
- Zarqawi ? - Zarqawi ,

466

Well , how do we find it ?

471
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,510
Look at me when we talk , Where can we find him ?

472
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:58,424
He asked for money ,

00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:04,463
- $ 100,000 , - You have $ 100,000 ?

474
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,489
You do not have any evidence of this type there ,

475
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:17,401
Hello ,

Amira Khalaf Fanus ? - It was the original name of butchers ,

00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:57,474
He was number two Zarqawi ,

486
00:44:57,517 --> 00:44:59,348
He is one ,

487
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:02,378
Yes , but do not know his real name , otherwise they would have written ,

488
00:45:03,457 --> 00:45:05,516
There are a number of pseudonyms ,

01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,435
Okay , let's get him,

656
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:54,302
Wrap it before I go ,

657
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,365
- In the action , together with the legend , What?

658
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:59,469
- Legend , -Will tell you another time ,

659
01:00:59,478 --> 01:01:02,379
- You are a great man, - Thank you ,

660
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:04,349
What would you say ?

661
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,319
The Gospels are bulletproof ?

662
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:11,449
- It ? - Yes , I have never seen you open it ,

663
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:16,359
We must respect God , do not you?

664
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:18,454
You have a God ?

665
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,458
Why not ?

666
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:28,340
When I was a kid was the electric fence near our house ,

667
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:31,241
Children try to touch and enduring ,

668
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:34,369
War like that ,

669
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:38,444
You must hold firmly ,

670
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,480
Do you want to get out of the team ?

671
01:01:44,323 --> 01:01:45,517
I just wanted to believe what we do ,

672
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:48,254
We are chasing the bad guys ,

673
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,352
Yes , there are bad people everywhere ,

674
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:54,457
You want to come to San Diego or New York ?

675
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:58,301
We not only protect the sandy soil ,

676
01:01:59,538 --> 01:02:04,271
Okay , Let us kill him ,

677
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:20,323
I was in the building next to the East facing restaurant ,

678
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:25,293
Login , Come on ,

679

680
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:52,380
- Lie down , - All right , all right ,

681
01:02:52,424 --> 01:02:55,325
Put your hands behind your head ,

682
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:05,334
Target looks , I looked out the window , Chris ,

683
01:03:05,404 --> 01:03:07,395
- Creating a safe limit , - Well , let's get ready ,

684
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:09,373
At the corner ,

685
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,434
Let's move to another room ,

686
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,313
Your wife knows ? Do you know this man?

687
01:03:20,419 --> 01:03:22,387
She said she does not know ,

688
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:25,353
How are you, son ? Do you know this person ?

689
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,392
Are you sure ?

690
01:03:29,528 --> 01:03:33,362
If you tell them you are not going to go ,

691
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:41,296
Hey , keep the window of the eye , be sure to take pictures all incoming and outgoing ,

692
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,426
What did we get ?

693
01:04:02,494 --> 01:04:05,395
16 military agents entered ,

694
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:09,458
- 16 ? - Yes , they serve more customers ,

695
01:04:10,502 --> 01:04:13,266
Look at this ,

696
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:20,536
- He 's still there ? - He just walked in,

697
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:24,476
- He was there , but it is not easy to achieve , I do not know about him ,

698
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:30,277
They see the entry of the legend , it was like a celebrity , autograph ?

699
01:04:30,422 --> 01:04:32,413
They partying ?

700
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:35,357
Hey , I do not promote myself ,

701
01:04:35,394 --> 01:04:38,261
True, I did it for you ,

702
01:04:38,264 --> 01:04:42,394
- I 'll be the head, if it were not for us , - Exactly ,

703
01:04:48,474 --> 01:04:52,308
He invites you to dinner ldul Adha ,

704
01:04:52,444 --> 01:04:55,504
He said to this day it all had to sit down and eat with him ,

705
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:59,312
He was very sweet ,

706
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:19,266
Cucumber is put here ?

707
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:22,263
Yes I Do, This chili ,

708
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:24,367
Soaked overnight ,

709
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,378
Then just add vodka ,

710
01:05:26,412 --> 01:05:30,371
- This is the point , - Just do it ,

711
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:33,283
Well , the food is delicious ,

712

That 's a good question ,

713
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:40,425
All these people ,

714
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:52,270
Oh My ,

You will eat your left hand?

716
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:06,450
Come on ,

717
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:09,283
I want to wash my hands ,

718
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,351
Hello ,

719
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:27,396

Well , you tell him whether to go to jail ,

In lraq , they know what to do with him ,

729
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:57,520
or he can help us in searching for that person in the restaurant ,

730
01:07:58,297 --> 01:08:00,288
Tell him , that's his choice ,

- Your friends are also lost? - Yes , as well as theirs,

820
01:17:10,515 --> 01:17:13,450
Even when you're here , you're not here ,

821
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:17,355
I see you , I feel you ,

822
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,515
But you're not here ,

823
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:39,534
I hate that goal,

824
01:17:41,513 --> 01:17:43,481
It's true ,

825
01:17:43,481 --> 01:17:45,472
You're my husband ,

826
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:49,249
You're the father of my children , but not their apology back ,

827
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:58,453
They can not wait , can not wealso ,

828
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:07,232
If you think that this war does not change you , you're wrong ,

829
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,502
You just can not walk in circles ,

830
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:26,414
This is true,

831
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:45,538
This Cadillac 31 , we are after a courier Butcher ,

832
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:48,410
we are on the way Marilyn , replace ,

833
01:18:49,347 --> 01:18:51,440
Hey , what might be called ,

834
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,513
- From where? From here ? - Yes , it is cheaper here ,

835
01:18:56,421 --> 01:18:59,447
You can buy it from the collector ? How do you know that there is no blood in the ring ?

836
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:04,258
What do you care ? You are much killing here , a legend ,

837
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:07,389
- Do not ring , What 's the problem?

838
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,333
- It is a hypocrite , - Slow down ,

839
01:19:11,336 --> 01:19:13,304
- Do not get too close , - All right , you tell him ,

840
01:19:13,304 --> 01:19:17,240
- You tell him where did you get ? - Of course not , I would say that he bought somewhere else ,

841
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:21,535
Are you still with us ?

842
01:19:21,546 --> 01:19:25,312
Half a block in the back , We are ready ,

843
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,518
You know , D ,,,

844
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:30,386
My guess is 20 years away at the gathering ,

845
01:19:31,322 --> 01:19:33,415
You will marry a man ,

846
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:36,289
As long as they can cook and clean ,

847
01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:47,334
- It's them , Oh My ,

848
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:50,373
We have people all over the city ,

849
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,367
They are all that Al-Qaeda - like,

850
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:13,230
Hey , next time if you could shoot , you do not succeed , do not you?

851
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:16,392
And for the gang to rescue you ,

852
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:48,263
- So , you're gonna be my date ? - Who else ?

853
01:20:48,299 --> 01:20:50,460
There is only one companion ,

854
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:59,300
Beacon 1're fired!

855
01:20:59,377 --> 01:21:01,402
The -COMe , give me a glass of protection , - All right ,

856
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:23,523
Let's go,

857
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:30,439
Certainly ,

858
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:33,339
Come with me ,

859

We saw them , Bacon safe ,

860
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:50,484
Prepare safety , Chris ,

861
01:21:51,362 --> 01:21:53,296
Well ,,,

862
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:55,299
Secure the roof ,

863
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:59,492
You are not afraid to announce after what she knows ?

864
01:22:00,538 --> 01:22:03,371
No, Prepare safety ,

865
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:06,241
- Now I'm a little worried , - It should ,

866
01:22:06,277 --> 01:22:08,404
Do you think you could keep track of diamonds ?

867
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:10,438
I think so ,

868
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:15,384
You are all right?

869
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:23,359
There were shooting , Beagles shot ,

870
01:22:23,394 --> 01:22:25,362
Northwest corner , on top of the roof ,

871
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:31,535
Hold on ,

01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:38,338
I need a medical today ,

Okay , we will pick you up and take you down ,

874
01:22:54,525 --> 01:22:56,459
Come on ,

875
01:23:10,308 --> 01:23:12,503
Come on , put it in a Humvee ,

876

-Angkat Ga , - All right ,

01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,505

Come , come in , Hold on , Beagles ,

01:23:30,294 --> 01:23:32,455
- Relax , - I'm sorry ,

882
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:34,488
For what ? Why are you apologizing ?

883
01:23:34,499 --> 01:23:37,400
- It was my fault , let's go up to the roof , -I Will die ?

884
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:40,299
Tidak , Beagles , Kau man frog ,

885
01:23:40,304 --> 01:23:43,432
Man frogs do not die , He will put the sand into the wound ,

886
01:23:43,508 --> 01:23:47,274
and entered the water , which is fine , Beagles , Hold on ,

887
01:23:47,278 --> 01:23:50,247
Hey , Chris , Make sure he can call , right?

888
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:52,282
Of course ,

889
01:23:56,287 --> 01:23:58,448
Lift penghisapnya ,

890
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:01,518
Blood again , How many more ?

891
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:05,292
We have 3 units of blood ,

892
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:06,454
Current ,

893
01:24:06,497 --> 01:24:09,261
- Vacuum , - Put it here ,

894
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,460
Press firmly !

895
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:14,261
Her blood more slowly ,

896
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,405
Did you see the killer ?

897
01:24:24,515 --> 01:24:27,313
No, the distance is 1000 meters more ,

898
01:24:27,452 --> 01:24:30,353
No one can shoot that far ,

899
01:24:31,556 --> 01:24:35,356
- Will you survive ? - He was treated ,

900
01:24:36,327 --> 01:24:39,421
- That's not good , - He was shot in the vitals ,

901
01:24:40,398 --> 01:24:42,332
Fuck !

902
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:47,270
We need to find that person ,

903
01:24:47,338 --> 01:24:50,307
The device is still looking for that person ,

904
01:24:50,374 --> 01:24:52,535
I understand if you do not want to continue and gather ,

905
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:55,307
Up to you,

906
01:24:55,379 --> 01:24:57,438
You are the leader ,

907
01:24:57,515 --> 01:25:00,348
Eye to eye ,

908
01:25:04,455 --> 01:25:06,514
We will be back ,

909
01:25:06,557 --> 01:25:09,355
- Nice, - Of course ,

910
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:11,361

I come along ,

912
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:45,362
Hi !

913
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:49,523
2 km to the south ,

914
01:26:19,363 --> 01:26:21,490
On the left side ,

915
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:27,430
Hallway ,

916
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,533
Surely hallway , On the left side ,

917
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,469
Certainly ,

918
01:26:35,513 --> 01:26:38,277
Everything is safe ,

919
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:43,443
Everything is safe ,

920
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:47,348
Mark , it seems that the rush to go ,

921
01:26:54,465 --> 01:26:57,457
- Get down ! - Stay away from the window !

922
01:26:58,302 --> 01:27:00,361
Stay away from the window !

923
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:12,442
Come on , Mark ,

924
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:17,350
Come on , friends , You got it,

925
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:19,380
Look at me ,

926
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,392
I am here ,

927
01:27:31,435 --> 01:27:33,460
Mark died , bro ,

928
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:37,534
There were shooting , I need help immediately ,

929
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:40,468
We have to move it ,

930
01:27:48,552 --> 01:27:54,491
The victory , some people after him , and some people stumble ,

931
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:57,418
Do not expect to find them ,

932
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:00,497
However , all are ,,,

933
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:04,262
good people stumble , My question is ,,,

934
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:08,429
When you win disappears and becomes salvation ?

935
01:28:09,273 --> 01:28:11,400
Or then it becomes ,,,

936
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:15,435
Who spent one I ,,,

937
01:28:16,514 --> 01:28:19,312
Loved ones in the war ,

938
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,441
And I saw ,,,

939
01:28:23,454 --> 01:28:26,389
Preparation !

940
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:29,483
Put your hands up !

941
01:28:30,528 --> 01:28:33,429
Ready ! The goal !

942
01:28:34,365 --> 01:28:36,333

Ready ! The goal !

946
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:48,368
Shoot ! Lower your weapons ,

947
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:44,492
Mark wrote a letter two weeks ago ,

948
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:50,338
He told you?

949
01:29:58,382 --> 01:30:01,317
Chris , I want to know what you think of the letter ,

950
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:06,320
Eat cold night , and ,,,

951
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:11,393
Beagles just shot , and suddenly we were attacked ,

952
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,456
But is not it strange ,

953
01:30:15,533 --> 01:30:18,331
The letter was killed Mark ,

954
01:30:18,402 --> 01:30:22,338
He's just ,,, he died , and he paid the price ,

955
01:30:33,484 --> 01:30:35,452
Signature here ,

956

- Damn, you 're blind as a bat , - Yes , the bullet jerk ,

960
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,341
They said they would fix my face ,

961
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:01,435
Fortunately, we tell them to fix it ,

962
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:03,310
Seriously ,

963
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:05,540
- Too fast? - Too fast ,

964
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:08,518
- Hey , I heard that apply , - Yes I Do,

965
01:31:08,552 --> 01:31:10,520
Welcome ,

966
01:31:10,521 --> 01:31:12,489
You did not tell him what you are buying diamond

967
01:31:12,523 --> 01:31:15,287
- At this point , right? - I do not ,

968
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:17,419

- Yes I Do, - Nice,

971
01:31:24,268 --> 01:31:26,361
He will not leave me , bro ,

972
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:30,398
I told him to go , he did not want ,

973
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:34,241
He wants to be with me ,

974
01:31:34,545 --> 01:31:36,536
Why do you say that ?

975
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:39,311
Do not say it like that , he loves you ,

976
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:44,321
- He was in love with you , - Are you kidding ,

977
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,282
Yes , I'm glad that I have ,

978
01:31:49,393 --> 01:31:52,385
-I Knew that you can handle it , - Maybe you're right ,

979
01:31:53,497 --> 01:31:57,297
You said you were the deadliest sniper in US military history ,

980
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:59,461
- Really? - That's what I heard ,

981
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:04,406
- You say that ? - Yes ,

982
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:07,376
- We're not going , - Yes , we'll get him,

01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:10,437
-Ayolah , I do not have to do it , - We need to do ,

984
01:32:11,282 --> 01:32:14,445
You're my brother , and they have to pay for what they did for you ,

985
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,250
How do you do it ?

986
01:32:19,423 --> 01:32:21,448
There are crazy ,

987
01:32:27,331 --> 01:32:29,356
He survived ,

988
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:32,264
He will be fine ,

989
01:32:32,303 --> 01:32:34,396
He is not valid ,

990
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,407
Do you want to die ?

991
01:32:39,443 --> 01:32:41,411
If that's what you want ,

992
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:43,413
What ?

993
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:46,278
Tell me ,

994
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:50,281
Why did you do this ? I want to understand ,

995
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:52,414
I did it for you , I did it to protect you ,

996
01:32:52,423 --> 01:32:54,482
- I do not , - Yes I Do,

997
01:32:54,525 --> 01:32:59,394
I am here , Here your family , your children , no father ,

998
01:32:59,396 --> 01:33:02,490
-I To serve my country , - That's nonsense !

999
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:05,400
- I do not , - I do not know when to stop ,

1000
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:10,535
You've done your job , you've sacrificed enough , let someone else go ,

1001
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,509
- Allowing others to go ? - Yes ,

1002
01:33:12,543 --> 01:33:15,410
I can not live , - You have to find a way ,

1003
01:33:16,313 --> 01:33:18,440
You should do it ,

1004
01:33:22,453 --> 01:33:26,412
Okay ? I want to be human again ,

1005
01:33:28,492 --> 01:33:31,359
I need you here ,

1006
01:33:32,363 --> 01:33:35,298
You need here ,

1007
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:39,459
If you go again ,,,

1008
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:43,404
I think we will not be here when you return ,

1009
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:11,495
Chris ,

1010
01:34:12,536 --> 01:34:15,505
We had three consecutive missions ,

1011
01:34:15,506 --> 01:34:18,475
That would be even worse ,

1012
01:34:18,509 --> 01:34:21,478
- It will be chaotic , - Are you coming ?

1013
01:34:21,512 --> 01:34:23,480
I think so ,

1014
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,381
His wife criticized him ,

1015
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:31,252
Once again my wife will kill me ,

1016
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:33,485
- Exactly , - I do not understand ,

1017
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:37,551
I went to the hospital earlier , it is bad ,

1018
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:40,386
He was already dead , Chris ,

1019
01:34:41,398 --> 01:34:45,528
He underwent surgery yesterday , died on the operating table ,

1020
01:34:53,343 --> 01:34:57,279
It Taya , leave a message ,

1021
01:34:57,314 --> 01:35:00,283
That's me , I just want to hear your voice ,

1022
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,345
I think of the things you say ,,,

1023
01:35:05,422 --> 01:35:08,289
Tell the children that you love them ,

1024
01:35:08,325 --> 01:35:10,384
I love you too ,

1025
01:36:35,412 --> 01:36:37,471
Time,

1026
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:53,257
Come on ,

1027
01:37:20,524 --> 01:37:27,293
Listen , they believe they will be able to help us win the war ,

1028
01:37:27,331 --> 01:37:32,428
The problem is that planners who can not be defeated by a sniper ,

1029
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:33,528
In what ?

1030
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:37,431
- Approximately 100 km , There's something else ?

1031
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:40,409
I do not know , - Snipers kill us ,

1032
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:43,538
It was anyone , We just have to kill him ,

1033
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:49,349
We have blocked six blocks North hostile territory , which will be in front of the shooter jitunya ,

1034
01:37:49,386 --> 01:37:52,480
- In the middle of the desert storm ? - Bring your sunglasses ,

1035
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:56,424
We need to kill the sniper , Understand ?

1036
01:37:56,426 --> 01:38:00,419
- Be prepared , - Yes , sir ,

1037
01:40:05,455 --> 01:40:10,290
-safe , - Going down , Come on ,

1038
01:40:10,394 --> 01:40:11,554
Come on ,

1039
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:19,493
Certainly , Time,

1040
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:26,339
Everything is safe , The building is safe ,

1041
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:08,511
No one came , Hold fire ,

1042
01:41:17,527 --> 01:41:20,496
In the middle of a desert storm ,

1043
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:02,404
-Awas ! - Cover!

1044
01:42:05,275 --> 01:42:09,302
Shit , Best of the East,

1045
01:42:14,451 --> 01:42:17,420
We are in the wrong position ,

1046
01:42:18,488 --> 01:42:23,425
It does not matter , Hold fire , There are people below us ,

1047
01:42:55,425 --> 01:42:58,326
There is a target at 19 meters ,

1048
01:42:58,328 --> 01:43:02,389
I can not see that far , Hold fire , We can get caught ,

1049
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:05,265
He is right , it makes no sense ,

1050
01:43:05,268 --> 01:43:08,294
Correction , 21 meters ,

1051
01:43:09,372 --> 01:43:12,307
More than 1 km , It is impossible to shoot , Chris ,

1052
01:43:24,354 --> 01:43:26,322
LTU dia ,

1053
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:31,518
I have a goal , instead ,

1054
01:43:31,528 --> 01:43:35,362
Understandably , the soldiers will soon arrive in 20 minutes ,

1055
01:43:50,413 --> 01:43:53,473
- He oversees our friends , - Can you confirm ?

1056
01:43:56,453 --> 01:43:58,478
LTU dia ,

1057
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:02,349
- That's him , - Your decision , Chris ,

1058
01:44:02,392 --> 01:44:06,328
The team will arrive within 20 minutes , Hold fire ,

1059
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:21,305
You must kill him ,

1060
01:44:23,313 --> 01:44:26,282
This is very important ,

1061
01:44:26,483 --> 01:44:28,542
I 'm going to do ,

1062
01:45:02,452 --> 01:45:04,511
He has drunk ,

1063
01:45:06,556 --> 01:45:10,458
- Tango decline , - We need help ,

1064
01:45:14,497 --> 01:45:19,264
- Mission accomplished , - He oversees our people ,

1065
01:45:19,302 --> 01:45:23,398
- Kill him , - Yes , now we're stuck ,

1066
01:45:26,276 --> 01:45:28,369
He will be proud of,

1067
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:32,310
You did it , Chris ,

1068
01:45:33,516 --> 01:45:37,452

They will come ,

- Where is it? -Arah 3 hours ,

1081

Only one of the remaining tracks ,

01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:19,371
Hold on! Anyone have any ammunition ?

1083
01:48:19,415 --> 01:48:21,542
We can not hold more , We have to move !

1084
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:25,282
- They are stuck , - Let's go down the road ,

01:56:06,449 --> 01:56:09,384
You were not the coach ,

1150
01:56:12,288 --> 01:56:16,349
He will lose the tooth , I'm a little worried ,

1151
01:56:16,392 --> 01:56:18,519
He says he only can you withdraw ,

1152
01:56:18,527 --> 01:56:20,518
Would you like to do ?

1153
01:56:38,381 --> 01:56:40,440
Chris ?

1154
01:56:54,463 --> 01:56:58,331
I can pull out of your wife's phone ,

1155
01:56:58,334 --> 01:57:00,461
She talks about the grill ,

1156
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,438
That's a shame ,

1157
01:57:03,472 --> 01:57:07,272
It seems out of control , You are worried ?

1158
01:57:07,276 --> 01:57:08,470
No, sir ,

1159
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:12,379
So , do not worry about that happening ?

1160
01:57:12,381 --> 01:57:14,508
No, sir , I'm not worried about that,

1161
01:57:15,518 --> 01:57:18,351
I want to ask you , Chris ,

1162
01:57:18,354 --> 01:57:20,413
How long have you served your country ?

1163
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:25,386
- 4 mission , so ,,, - About a thousand days ?

01:57:25,428 --> 01:57:27,419
Ya , then ,

1165
01:57:28,264 --> 01:57:35,295
You will be surprised if I said to kill more AL record of 160 ?

1166
01:57:35,538 --> 01:57:42,535
Ever thought I do not want you doing there?

1167
01:57:42,545 --> 01:57:45,309
That's not me ,

1168
01:57:45,514 --> 01:57:47,277
Like what ?

1169
01:57:47,283 --> 01:57:51,276
I'm just protecting his friends , They are trying to kill our troops ,

1170
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,551
I was willing to die to protect them ,

1171
01:57:57,526 --> 01:58:03,396
The problem I feel sad for people who can not be saved ,

1172
01:58:05,334 --> 01:58:10,362
I want to be there , but I'm here , stop ,

1173
01:58:11,474 --> 01:58:14,272
So , you want to save even more people ?

1174
01:58:15,277 --> 01:58:16,403
Ya , then ,

1175
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:21,374
You can go from here ,

1176
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:24,385
There are many soldiers who were saved ,

1177
01:58:29,425 --> 01:58:33,452
- Want to go for a walk ? - Of course ,

1178

How can ?

1181
01:58:46,542 --> 01:58:51,343
When it exploded , both hands on the steering wheel ,

1182
01:58:51,347 --> 01:58:54,441
before the explosion , my right hand

1183
01:58:54,483 --> 01:58:59,284
reached for a cigarette and put it in her mouth , When I turned on ,,,

1184
01:58:59,288 --> 01:59:04,385
There was an explosion , Destroy all of my left hand ,
