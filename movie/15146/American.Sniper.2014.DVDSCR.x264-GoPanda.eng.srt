1
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,515
Heat once the weather.

2
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:18,426
Land here tastes like dog shit.

3
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,326
You know, huh?

4
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:22,260
Fuck!

5
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:30,369
Break.

6
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:13,448
There are men of military force, are call,
pay attention to the convoy. over.
7
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:18,419
lf he reported troop movements please shoot.
Your turn. over
8
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,288
Maybe he called his wife.

9
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:30,488
Him down.

10
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:44,345
Moment. There were women and children,
within 200 yards, moving towards the convoy.

11
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,418
Arms were not moving.
He brought something.

12
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:05,390
He pulls out a grenade. RKG Russia grenade.
l think he gave it to the boy.

13
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:10,304
- Women and children? - You saw it?
Can insure?

14
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,500
Negative. You know ROE.
Your turn.

15
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,341
- They will burn you if you're wrong.
They will put you in jail. - Fuck.

16
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,429
You've done about it.

17
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:52,542
Come back here.

18
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,509
Never leave your
gun on the ground.

19
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,510
Yes, sir.

20
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:07,524
Good shot. You're talented.

21
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:11,457
One day you will
be a great hunter.

22
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:18,406
Listen to this book, several times.
That judgment ..

23
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,502
for the trust.

24
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,441
Time where we have to do it.
We can not see with his eyes.

25
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,282
So we do not know the
glory of his plans.

26
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:34,285
Eyes we see it as a
reflection in the glass.

27
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,289
- The day we arrived...
- Why are you doing this?

28
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:43,391
We will see it clearly. And
understand the mystery of how.

29
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,459
Let us pray.

30
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:48,528
There are 3 types of
people in this world.

31
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,507
Sheep, wolf and sheepdog.

32
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,534
Some people believe

33
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,504
devil does not exist
in the world--

34
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:02,478
And if hatred appeared at their door
do not know how to protect themselves.

35
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,445
lt was a sheep.

36
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:09,354
Then there are predators.
They use violence

37
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,382
to prey on the weak.

38
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,291
They are wolves.

39
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,261
Then there are those

40
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,456
blessed with talent aggression

41
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,428
and protect the flock.

42
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,499
They are a rare breed who
live to face serigala--

43
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,410
They sheepdog.

44
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,516
We do not raise sheep
in this family

45
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:39,387
and l would beat if you become wolves.
- Wayne--

46
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:46,260
But we protect our herd.

47
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,398
And if someone tried to fight

48
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,335
or protect your sister you get
my permission to finish .

49
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,395
He attacked Jeff.

50
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:01,432
ls that correct?
- Yes, Sir. True.

51
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,371
And you finish it?

52
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,284
You know who you are.

53
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,516
You know your goals.

54
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,370
There is not anyone there.

55
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,515
You're out with a waist belt.

56
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:17,275
- What should you do?
- Sleeping with it.

57
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:20,551
- l'll wear it and see her make mood changed.
- Strong winds make her mood changed.

58
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,319
ls that what they say?

59
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,417
- You know what they call it when
Sarah menghisap-- SMA-- - Do not say.

60
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:27,486
Jeez, Chris.

61
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,395
lt recompense.

62
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:42,506
- There are 2 ladies...
- She continues to see it.

63
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:46,509
- Wait till you see this.
- Yes l Do.

64
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,442
Hey, babe who wants rodeo star?

65
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:50,440
What the fuck?

66
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,454
You said he did not come
home until tomorrow.

67
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:55,423
- l said what?
- Do not bother him.

68
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,425
He did not do anything.

69
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,360
Chris, do not disturb him!

70
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,454
Leave him alone!

71
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,294
Fuck, what's with you ?!

72
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,461
- He does not know, okay?
- What does she know?

73
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,265
- You do not know?
- l take my hat.

74
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,464
He does not know.

75
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:16,410
- You do not know?
- What is wrong with you ?!

76
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,414
Why did you do that to everyone?

77
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,383
Get out of here!

78
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:25,315
What is it with you!

79
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:30,389
- Exit.
- l do not know what you expect of me.

80
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,293
You brought me here and exit together
with your brother every weekend!

81
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:37,255
Think why am l doing this?

82
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:40,301
l'm doing this to get attention!

83
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:45,432
Take your things and get out.

84
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:49,272
Good. Screw you!

85
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:52,471
Do you think you could
be a rodeo cowboy for?

86
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:56,307
You're not a cowboy. You
only farm administrators.

87
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,409
And you lowly!

88
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,323
Do not say.

89
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,320
Gosh.

90
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:17,465
l do not understand what you said.
We had to travel to another state.

91
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,468
Different city every weekend.

92
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:25,502
- Can not stay here.
- Maybe he's right.

93
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:29,381
- But he's right.
- True matter what, Chris?

94
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:33,454
He was not true. We cowboy.
Living in a dream.

95
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:53,440
Friend, friend see this.

96
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:15,258
- You're from Texas?
- Yes, Sir.

97
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,492
- You're a patriot.
- Yes l Do.

98
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,391
-And you're angry.
- l want to serve.

99
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,369
- Fight?
- Yes, Sir.

100
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:27,275
Meet elite fighters.

101
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,503
- Seals?
- Sea, air and land.

102
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:35,406
- l am less able to swim, sir.
- This is not for a broken heart.

103
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:39,353
- Most people will stop. - l'm not
most people, sir. l do not stop.

104
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,449
Lift your feet!

105
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:47,553
Thank this!

106
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:51,329
This is the first time.

107
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:55,435
lf you are swept away,
you're going to die!

108
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:58,531
Do not turn your face from me.
View and accept this.

109
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,469
Old are old, huh?

110
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:05,439
Did you join the Navy because they
want to have fun at Noah's Ark?

111
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:09,508
- How old are you? 30! You've dusty
and disappeared. - 30 years.

112
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,319
We will do it again.

113
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:17,358
We're going to be a fighter.

114
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:20,259
l never see him.

115
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,322
l come to deal with terrorists.

116
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,368
Who did it?

117
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:29,529
l do not know.

118
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,530
- Did l ask you?
- Do Not.

119
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:36,277
Look at you.

120
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:42,477
You bastard! That's what l said.

121
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:46,253
Biggles, the name now.

122
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,323
And the tickets very difficult.

123
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:52,487
What are you doing here
if you hate water ?

124
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,462
Never mind, sir. l'm not black.

125
00:12:54,496 --> 00:13:00,298
- No? - l'm the new black. We
ran slow, low jump and swim.

126
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:04,294
And l make whites proud!

127
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,369
That people who quit!

128
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,481
You say goodbye.

129
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:17,284
lf he stops here, he stopped
on the battlefield.

130
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,321
When everything is in trouble,
he will not pull you out.

131
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,358
l am looking for a knight.

132
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:32,367
l can not hear? Do you want to call your
parents? Maybe they can replace you.

133
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:37,427
This is a game.

134
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:43,274
That's what l'm talking about.
- Where are you?

135
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,304
We will survive, sir!

136
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:47,507
They are warm!

137
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,409
Give her speech.

138
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,445
How are you, old man?

139
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:56,346
How are you?

140
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,289
Dangerous.

141
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:03,296
l felt dangerous.
- He feels dangerous.

142
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,529
Go!

143
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,327
Oh yes it penyiksaanmu!

144
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:46,466
Again.

145
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:52,377
lf you want the
target, use this.

146
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:57,247
- Hello.
- Hi There.

147
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,355
- What are you doing?
- Okay, thank you.

148
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:09,419
- Can l buy you a drink? - What makes
you drink 6 inches higher and charming?

149
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,465
What makes you not married?

150
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:15,333
l'm watching you.

151
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:16,495
Do not be a loser.

152
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,335
Go home.

153
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,474
lt might leather pants.

154
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,374
Oh yeah?

155
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,316
Pants what to wear women
so as not to be disturbed?

156
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,480
Maybe Corduroy.

157
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,225
What is kalian-- suddenly
single after 3 beers?

158
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:43,364
What happens after the third
beer is the fourth beer.

159
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,491
Good.

160
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:49,396
- Red-neck real. - l'm not
a red-neck, l Texans.

161
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:54,475
- What is the difference? - We
rode horses, they rode cousin.

162
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,437
What do you do before?

163

You're very selfish thought could

193
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,451
Our commander said

194
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:59,299
there are three things that should we
worry about: ego, alcohol and women.

195
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:02,326
Sounds like you are
being attacked.

196
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,465
You're beautiful.

197
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,341

so do not think about it.

200
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:44,342
Feel the air fill every
cell in your body .

201
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,472
This is our ritual.

202
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:51,446
We master the breath, we
master the mind kita--

203
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,354
pull the trigger will
be no conscious effort.

204
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,425
You will notice but
not directing it.

205
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:02,328
When you exhale,
regarded as pause,

206
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,330
and the space
between heartbeats.

207
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:24,511

- l love children. You like?

231

My mom said l had a nose

232
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,442
lt was a bad thing
to say to a woman .

233
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:06,513
He was right.

Do we see the same target?

239
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:39,344
You spit in the dust.

240
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:43,423
Do not worry, we can wear substitute
for people who can not shoot.

241
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:46,260
Oh shit!

00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:33,371
Do you close your eyes?

246
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:36,469
lf l close my eyes, can
not see the target.

247
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,378
There was nothing there except the target.
- Negative. There's something there.

248
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,278
Come.

249

Everything. l do not know.
What if it did not work?

256
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:10,471
We'll get married
and start a family.

257
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:14,307

You need a ring if you want

260
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:39,255
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.

Neck is no makeup.

263
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:57,475
Do you believe if l say that?

264
00:24:58,286 --> 00:24:59,412

265
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:04,314
Because of them. - Oh, God.

Cheers.

267
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:10,263
What he said, Chief?

There is nothing to fear.
This is part of the plan.

273
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:40,486
Heart beats.

274

Because l'm going to go to war.

275

Welcome to Fallujah.

276

You made it?

307

You're doing yourjob.

Fuck! What the hell!

316
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:50,393
Are you watching, Einstein?

317
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:52,369
You can thank him later.

00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:23,482
Keep an eye on the roof!

323
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:45,273
There were shot.

324
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:52,442
Snipers visible enemy.
Location R155704.

325
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:01,495
Smell in here.

326
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,454
You protect us. lt
was a good shot.

327
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,264
- Clean, right?
- True.

328
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:12,267
Snipers enemy sneaked in.

329
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,467
Yes, it will not happen again.

330
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:18,467
Should not happen again. There is a
hot entrusted quarter mile away.

331
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,413
l will make a report.

332
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,315
- How much do you get?
- l can six.

333
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:26,480
No, l can be eight, but
they dragged two people.

334
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:30,322
- You can be six?
- Yes, why?

335
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:34,316
- You can be more than the others.
- Yes, but they can be one of us.

336
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,387
You can not hit what
you can not see .

337
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:42,468
- She said she brought the Quran.
- l do not know the form of the Quran.

338
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,461
But l can describe
what he was carrying.

339
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:49,273
Metal objects, firing bullets
7.62, and looks like the AK-47.

340
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:51,244
So what does he bring?

341
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:03,481
He came.

342
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:09,292
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up.
There is a legend among us.

343
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:12,489
Give him applause.

344
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,370
The legend is already making a record.
He killed 100 people with one shot.

345
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:23,502
One shot of a man.

346
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,536
He ''blew'' 100 men.

347
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:30,245
And he's still single.

348
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,481
Gosh.

349
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:35,478
Competition throw food? Come on.

350
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,357
The only way to make silent.

351
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,396
Did you kill people?

352
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,264
Not the way to start a
conversation, dear.

353
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:50,530
Do not behave like that to me.

354
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,430
l want you to tell
me everything.

355
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:57,368
There are some things that can
not be said on the phone .

356
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:02,415
You make me pregnant and l
sat alone put up cots ...

357
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,508
... and you can not talk to me?

358
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,453
That's your big plan?

359
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:10,481
All okay in there?

360
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,294
l can not stop thinking
pink dress it.

361
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:19,298
His name evening gown.

362
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,324
Yes.

363
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:26,496
Three days is not
counted as a honeymoon.

364
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,304
lt was three days of fun.

365
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:38,314
- l miss you.
- l missed you too.

366
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:43,516
- You want me to talk naughty to you?
- Yes, wait a minute.

367
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:52,288
l was holding a rifle.

368
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:55,427
You have to decide which
is more important, dear.

369
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:59,270
You really are lust.

370
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:02,275
l'm fat and horny.
lt was disgusting.

371
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:05,445
Although weight is 150 pounds, l
still want to make love to you.

372
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,510
- Really romantic.
- How is my son?

373
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:15,445
- No one said he was a man.
- You two would be amazing.

374
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:17,517
How do you know?

375
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,387
l know. l can see it.

376
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,558
- l hope you're right.
- l am right.

377
00:37:29,536 --> 00:37:33,472
- Your father contacted you?
- l do not check my email.

378
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:35,407
Gosh.

379
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:37,502
You should call him, okay?

380
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,513
- What is it?
- l do not think straight.

381
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:43,448
What is it?

382
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:49,388
- Brother sent.
- What do you mean? To a school?

383
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,484
No, he did not go to school.
Contact your father.

384
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,427
What do you mean? Where is she?

385
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,457
There.

386
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,528
She toward lraq.

387
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,495
Sorry, dear.

388
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:12,478
The man who held the knife is a member of
the radical Jordan Bin Laden financed.

389
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:16,313
Trained by Bin Laden,
loyal to bin Laden.

390
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:19,411
Name was Zarqawi.

391
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:24,513
Bastard This is the prince
of Al-Qaeda in lraq.

392
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,393
Army, AQl, amounted
to 5 thousand people.

393
00:38:29,396 --> 00:38:31,455
They are not ordinary
mercenary troops.

394
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,296
They are well
trained, well paid...

395
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:38,499
... and this time, they run the operation
biggest offensive since Vietnam.

396
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:43,536
Zarqawi and his Lieutenant,
they is our top priority.

397
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:46,513
There is only one
way to find their .

398
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:51,246
That check from door to
door, until we find them...

399
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:54,345
... Or someone who could
provide their location.

400
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:59,254
So we need to examine
10 building per hour.

401
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,557
l know it very much,
very aggressive .

402
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,293
Do not rely on air support.

403
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:09,292
This is the highest priority
targets until today.

404
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:13,466
l want them dead or
captured, understand?

405
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,273
Have a question?

406
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:24,340
lf the marines haste,
they could be shot.

407
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,444
They can not be
training like us.

408
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:28,421
Most of them civilians
6 months ago.

409
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:32,324
Let us train them. l
will show them how.

410
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:34,350
No, we need you to keep
an eye on the situation.

411
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:38,388
- The enemy already knows we're up there.
- Under extremely dangerous.

412
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,267
You want to be the savior?

413
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,260
l just wanted to catch them.
Can not see, can not shoot.

414
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:47,432
They all know your name. They
feel safe when you're up there.

415
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:50,272
- No.
- That's what they think.

416
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:54,346
So stay up there, watch them.

417
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:08,255
You said snipers AQl never
follow the Olympics?

418
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:11,264
While lraq has not qualified
for three Olympics.

419
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:14,291
Mustafa instead of lraq.

420
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,504
He is from Syria.

421
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:31,382
Once you get in, l could
not see anything.

422
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,478
So only slowly.

423
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:36,250
Good.

424
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:39,282
Go!

425
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,276
To hell with this.

426
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:01,413
l will go down
with the marines .

427
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,244
You coming?

428
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,442
Not.

429
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:09,388
l want to go home alive.

430
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:14,486
Not work knocking on the door.
l do not want to do that.

431
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:16,520
lf l do not see
you down there...

432
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,432
... sure l will not
see you again.

433
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:28,332
Hey, do you mind if
l come with you?

434
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,340
Course.

435
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:35,540
You're the legend that, right?
You've killed 24 people?

436
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:38,342
- l do not count them.
- lt was really cool.

437
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:40,546
There's a nigger in
Bravo the chase.

438
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:43,489
l know a few things.

439
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,256
There are several things
that could show you, how?

440
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:49,453
Okay.

441
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:56,361
- What does that mean?
- Break.

442
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,377
Get down on the floor right now!

443
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,540
- Do not!
- Get down!

444
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,318
Why are you here? You
should evacuate.

445
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:17,323
Who are you?

446
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:19,554
l do not care about this house.

447
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,360
This is a war zone, sir. Down.

448
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:25,328
Quick .

449
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:27,426
They hide behind.

450
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:31,304
Still no one else in this house?

451
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:35,366
He's going to blow us.

452
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,275
Search the clothes.

453
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:40,542
- He knows we're talking.
- Who are you talking about?

454
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:43,414
Who knew we talk?

455
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:48,354
He cut...

456
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,357
- Please...
- Target already secured?

457
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:56,419
Okay, take him. Put your
hands behind your head.

458
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,490
Now! Fast!

459
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,369
Take him into another room.

460
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,510
lf he spoke, a man will
come to his house.

461
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,483
Who is ''he?''

462
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:26,419
Someone called Butcher.
A son of the devil.

463
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,360
He was a bouncer?

464
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,355
Warrior number one Zarqawi.

465
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,231
- Zarqawi?
- Zarqawi.

466
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:36,326
Yes, we want to know the location of Zarqawi.
Do you know where he is?

467
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,464
Tell us where he is.
How can we meet?

468
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:44,307
You're no information
about Zarqawi?

469
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:46,336
Find Butchers, you
will find Zarqawi.

470
00:43:46,346 --> 00:43:47,370
Okay, how do we find him?

471
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,510
Look at me when you're talking.
Where can we find it?

472
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:58,424
He asked for money.

473
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:04,463
- 100 thousand dollars.
- You need 100 thousand dollars?

474
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,489
You do not have any proof
of this person there.

475
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:17,401
Hello.

476
00:44:23,316 --> 00:44:24,442
This proves it.

477
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:30,320
l want to help, but l need something.
Phone number, address, name.

478
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:35,291
- Pak, third team need help.
- Moving On!

479
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:38,490
Look at me when you're talking.
Hey, look at me.

480

And there's nothing to talk about,

Victim of the American army.

609
00:57:33,306 --> 00:57:35,433
When we're on the

01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:10,386
This war is influenced by the
thoughts of our enemies.

644
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:12,260
Yes, sir.

645
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:17,468
- That's you?
- Yes, that's right, sir.

646
01:00:19,438 --> 01:00:21,531
You're the most
wanted man in lraq.

647
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:24,372
There is a 180 thousand dollar reward
above your head. Congratulations.

648
01:00:24,377 --> 01:00:27,471
Do not tell my wife.
He might fill my head.

649
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:32,508
Do you want to form a
team to hunt Butchers ?

650
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:34,315
Yes, sir.

651
01:00:35,354 --> 01:00:38,380

indicates operations area.

652
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:42,427
l want you to kill him.

653
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:44,488
Search him.

654
01:00:45,364 --> 01:00:46,388
Yes, sir.

655
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,435
Okay, let's get him.

656
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:54,302
Clean up all before going.

657
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,365
- Together with the legend in action.
- What Are?

658
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:59,469

- You're great, man.
- Thank you.

660
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:04,349
What would you say?

661
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,319
The book is bulletproof?

662
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:11,449
- This?
- Yes, l have never seen you open it.

663
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:16,359
We must honor God, right?

664
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:18,454
You have a God?

665
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,458
Why not?

666
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:28,340
When l was a kid there was an
electric fence near our house.

667
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:31,241
Children trying to touch
and the most enduring.

668
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:34,369
War like that.

669
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:38,444
You have to hold on tightly.

670
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,480
You want to get out of the team?

671
01:01:44,323 --> 01:01:45,517
l just want to believe
what we are doing.

672
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:48,254
We are chasing bad guys.

673
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,352
Yes, there are bad
people everywhere.

674
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:54,457
You want them to come to
San Diego or New York?

675
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:58,301

the sandy soil.

676
01:01:59,538 --> 01:02:04,271
Okay. Let us kill him.

- Get down.
- Okay, okay.

681
01:02:52,424 --> 01:02:55,325
Put your hands behind your head.

682
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:05,334
Target looks. l watched

683
01:03:05,404 --> 01:03:07,395
- Create a safe limit.
- Well, let's get ready.

684
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:09,373
ln a corner.

685
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,434
Let's move to another room.

686
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,313
Your wife know? Do
you know this man?

687
01:03:20,419 --> 01:03:22,387
She said she did not know.

688
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:25,353
How are you, son? Do
you know this face?

689
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,392
Are you sure?

690
01:03:29,528 --> 01:03:33,362
Should you tell them
not to go till we go.

691
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:41,296
Hey, keep an eye window, make sure you taking
pictures of all the incoming and outgoing.

16 military agents entered.

694
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:09,458
- 16?
- Yes, they serve many customers.

695
01:04:10,502 --> 01:04:13,266
See this.

696
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:20,536
- He's still there?
- He had just entered.

697
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:24,476
- He's in there, but not easy to reach.
- l do not know about it.

698
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:30,277
They see the legend entry, him like
a celebrity, ask for his autograph?

699
01:04:30,422 --> 01:04:32,413
They're partying?

700
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:35,357
Hey, l do not promote myself.

701
01:04:35,394 --> 01:04:38,261
True, l did it for you.

702
01:04:38,264 --> 01:04:42,394
- You're not going to be the
head if not for us. - True.

703
01:04:48,474 --> 01:04:52,308
He invites you to dinner Eid.

704
01:04:52,444 --> 01:04:55,504
He said on this day everything
have to sit down and eat with him.

705
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:59,312
He was really sweet.

706
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:19,266
Cucumber was put here?

707
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:22,263
Yes. This chili.

708
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:24,367
Soaked overnight.

709
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,378
Then just add vodka.

710
01:05:26,412 --> 01:05:30,371
- That's the point.
- Just do it.

711
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:33,283
Well, the food is delicious.

712
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,414
That's a good question.

713
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:40,425
All these people.

714
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:52,270
Gosh.

715

You will eat with
your left hand?

716
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:06,450
Come on.

717
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:09,283
l want to wash your hands.

718
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,351
Hey.

719
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:27,396
He was clean.

720
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,265
Hey!

721
01:07:30,502 --> 01:07:33,335
- Check it.
- Do not go anywhere.

722
01:07:33,405 --> 01:07:35,339
- Hey, what is this?
- Beagles,

723
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,240
Calm.

724
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:41,269
See it?

725
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,278
- Did you see?

726
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:46,274
- Bring the tarp.
- Oh My.

727
01:07:48,487 --> 01:07:52,423
Well, you tell him that
he would go to jail ,

728
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:55,358
in lraq, they know what
that would do to her ,

729
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:57,520
or she can help us look for
the man in the restaurant.

730
01:07:58,297 --> 01:08:00,288
Tell him, it's his choice.

731
01:08:32,364 --> 01:08:34,389
That's it.

732
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:37,393
Safe.

733
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:39,437
Good, let's move it.

734
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:45,266
Southern team ready.

735
01:08:48,413 --> 01:08:50,472
Security ready right.

736
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:52,507
She moves.

737
01:09:06,465 --> 01:09:08,456
15 meters.

738
01:09:11,503 --> 01:09:13,437
10 meters.

739
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,375
5 meters.

740
01:09:26,518 --> 01:09:28,486
He knocks.

741
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:35,283
Wait.

742
01:09:35,394 --> 01:09:37,453
They open it.

743
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:41,458

744
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,400

01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:52,400
Forward!

746
01:10:00,519 --> 01:10:02,487
Beagles, nothing
out of the back?

747
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:04,512
No, he did not move.

748
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,298
- D, put him down.
- Okay.

749
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:22,430
Put him down.

750
01:10:26,545 --> 01:10:29,480
We found something,
carefully, remain vigilant.

751
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,317
Enemies come!

752
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:40,286
Back!

753
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:45,456
Outer side of security!

01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,318
Get down!

755
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:29,431
There they are!

756
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:40,442
Butchers stir.

757
01:11:40,485 --> 01:11:42,544
3 Butchers move, l'm chasing.

758
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:56,299
Butchers shot, to your position.

759
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,291
We've told him, it's his choice.

760
01:12:21,326 --> 01:12:24,352
He chose the wrong
side, it's his choice.

761
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:30,524
Hey, Chris, Clean up all, we

l was lucky to
only lose one leg.

788
01:14:39,297 --> 01:14:41,356
- Your friends are also lost?
- Yes, they are.

789

But l'm talking about people who are

True. He saved my
life, and he...

797
01:15:13,465 --> 01:15:15,524

01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:47,390
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- You are welcome.

806
01:15:47,432 --> 01:15:49,366
- Have a good day.
- Ok.

807
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:51,494
- Bye.
- Let's meet your sister.

808
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,495
Hey, sorry, it's time.

809
01:16:28,306 --> 01:16:31,298
lt was my daughter, l think
you should take note him.

810
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:33,311
Excuse me.

811
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:37,313
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

812
01:16:37,482 --> 01:16:39,382
Hey!

813
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:41,408
Hey! Please note my son.

814
01:16:43,388 --> 01:16:45,288
Hey!

815
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:51,262
Hey! Please note my son now!

816
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,563
l make my own memory.

817
01:16:58,536 --> 01:17:01,300
l can not share it with anyone.

818
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,501
Well, it is.

819
01:17:07,545 --> 01:17:10,275
When did it begin?

820
01:17:10,515 --> 01:17:13,450
Even when you're here,
you're not here.

821
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:17,355
l see you, l feel you.

822
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,515
But you're not here.

823
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:39,534
l hate that team.

824
01:17:41,513 --> 01:17:43,481
True.

825
01:17:43,481 --> 01:17:45,472
You're my husband.

826
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:49,249
You're the father of my children,
but not their excuse back.

827
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:58,453
They can not wait,
we also can not.

828
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:07,232
lf you think this war not
change you, you're wrong.

829
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,502
You can just walk in circles.

830
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:26,414
That's right.

831
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:45,538
This Cadillac 31 we were to
follow the courier Butcher ,

832
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:48,410
we're on the road
Marylin, replace.

833
01:18:49,347 --> 01:18:51,440
Hey, you can ring.

834
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,513
- Where? From here?
- Yes, cheaper here.

835
01:18:56,421 --> 01:18:59,447
You buy it from the collector? How do
you know there is no blood in the ring?

836
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:04,258
What do you care? You killed
many here, you legend.

837
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:07,389
- Not to ring.
- What is the problem?

838
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,333
- lt's hypocritical.
- Slowly.

839
01:19:11,336 --> 01:19:13,304
- Do not get too close.
- Okay, you tell him.

840
01:19:13,304 --> 01:19:17,240
- You tell him where did you get it? - Of
course not, l would say l bought elsewhere.

841
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:21,535
Are you still with us?

842
01:19:21,546 --> 01:19:25,312
Half a block in the back.
We are ready.

843
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,518
You know, D...

844
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:30,386
guess is 20 years
away at the reunion.

845
01:19:31,322 --> 01:19:33,415
You're going to marry him.

846
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:36,289
As long as she can
cook and clean.

847
01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:47,334
- There they are.
- Oh My.

848
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:50,373
They have people
all over the city.

849
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,367
They are the Al-Qaeda-like
everything.

850
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:13,230
Hey, next time if you could
shoot, not to fail, right?

851
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:16,392
l into the alley to save.

852
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:48,263
- So, you're going to be my companion?
- Who else?

853
01:20:48,299 --> 01:20:50,460
There is only one companion.

854
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:59,300
Beacon 1 being fired!

855
01:20:59,377 --> 01:21:01,402
- Come on, give me a shot of protection.
- Okay.

856
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:23,523
Let's move.

857
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:30,439
Safe.

858
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:33,339
Come with me.

859
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:48,389
We see them. Bacon safe.

860
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:50,484
Prepare security, Chris.

861
01:21:51,362 --> 01:21:53,296
Well...

862
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:55,299
roof safe.

863
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:59,492
You're not afraid he would
release after she know?

864
01:22:00,538 --> 01:22:03,371
Not. Prepare security.

865
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:06,241
- Now l'm a little concerned.
- lt should.

866
01:22:06,277 --> 01:22:08,404
You mean she can keep
track of diamonds?

867
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:10,438
l think so.

868
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:15,384
Are you okay?

869
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:23,359
There were shot, Beagles shot.

870
01:22:23,394 --> 01:22:25,362
Angle northwest, on the roof.

871
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:31,535
Hold on.

872
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:38,338
l need a medical today.

873
01:22:48,519 --> 01:22:51,454
Okay, we will pick you
up and take you down .

874
01:22:54,525 --> 01:22:56,459
Come on.

875
01:23:10,308 --> 01:23:12,503
Come on, put him
into the Humvee.

876
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:15,402
- Lift him.
- Ok.

877
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,505
Quick .

878
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:22,476
Come on, get in. Hang
in there, Beagles.

879
01:23:23,287 --> 01:23:25,312
Hold, Beagles.

880
01:23:25,356 --> 01:23:27,381
Hold, Beagles.

881
01:23:30,294 --> 01:23:32,455
- Calm.
- l am sorry.

882
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:34,488
For what? Why are
you apologizing?

883
01:23:34,499 --> 01:23:37,400
- lt was my fault, we go up to the roof.
- l'm going to die?

884
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:40,299
No, Beagles. You Frogman.

885
01:23:40,304 --> 01:23:43,432
Frogman not die. He would
put sand in the wound,

886
01:23:43,508 --> 01:23:47,274
and enter the water, you're
fine, Beagles. Hold on.

887
01:23:47,278 --> 01:23:50,247
Hey, Chris. Make sure
he can ring it, okay?

888
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:52,282
Course.

889
01:23:56,287 --> 01:23:58,448
Raise suction.

890
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:01,518
Blood again. How much longer?

891
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:05,292
We need 3 units of blood.

892
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:06,454
Now.

893
01:24:06,497 --> 01:24:09,261
- Vacuum.
- Put it here.

894
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,460
Press firmly!

895
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:14,261
The blood less quickly.

896
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,405
Did you see the shooter?

897
01:24:24,515 --> 01:24:27,313
No, the distance is
1000 meters more.

898
01:24:27,452 --> 01:24:30,353
No one can shoot that far.

899
01:24:31,556 --> 01:24:35,356
- She will survive?
- He is being treated.

900
01:24:36,327 --> 01:24:39,421
- That's not good.
- He was shot in the vitals.

901
01:24:40,398 --> 01:24:42,332
Fuck!

902
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:47,270
We have to find that person.

903
01:24:47,338 --> 01:24:50,307
The units are still
looking for that person.

904
01:24:50,374 --> 01:24:52,535
l understand if you do not
want to continue and gather .

905
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:55,307
lt's up to you.

906
01:24:55,379 --> 01:24:57,438
You're the leader.

907
01:24:57,515 --> 01:25:00,348
Eye to eye.

908
01:25:04,455 --> 01:25:06,514
We will be back.

909
01:25:06,557 --> 01:25:09,355
- Good.
- Of course.

910
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:11,361
Come on.

911
01:25:12,396 --> 01:25:14,364
l participated.

912
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:45,362
Hey!

913
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:49,523
2 kilometers to the south.

914
01:26:19,363 --> 01:26:21,490
ln the left.

915
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:27,430
Hallway.

916
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,533
Hallway safe. On the left.

917
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,469
Safe.

918
01:26:35,513 --> 01:26:38,277
Everything is safe.

919
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:43,443
Everything is safe.

920
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:47,348
Mark, there seems
to be a rush to go.

921
01:26:54,465 --> 01:26:57,457
- Get down!
- Stay away from windows!

922
01:26:58,302 --> 01:27:00,361
Stay away from the window!

923
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:12,442
Come on, Mark.

924
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:17,350
Come on, friends. l got you.

925
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:19,380
Look at me.

926
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,392
l was here.

927
01:27:31,435 --> 01:27:33,460
Mark died, bro.

928
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:37,534
There are shot, l need
help immediately.

929
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:40,468
We have to move it.

930
01:27:48,552 --> 01:27:54,491
Victory, some people after
him, and some people stumble.

931
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:57,418
Do not expect to find them.

932
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:00,497
But everyone...

933
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:04,262
good people stumble.
My question...

934
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:08,429
When did it disappear victory
and become a safety?

935
01:28:09,273 --> 01:28:11,400
Or then it becomes...

936
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:15,435
The spending someone who l...

937
01:28:16,514 --> 01:28:19,312
Love in the war.

938
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,441
And l saw...

939
01:28:23,454 --> 01:28:26,389
Ready!

940
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:29,483
Lift arms!

941
01:28:30,528 --> 01:28:33,429
Ready! Aim!

942
01:28:34,365 --> 01:28:36,333
Shoot!

943
01:28:36,334 --> 01:28:38,268
Ready!

944
01:28:38,269 --> 01:28:40,533
Aim! Shoot!

945
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:43,535
Ready! Aim!

946
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:48,368
Shoot! Lower arms.

947
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:44,492
Mark wrote the letter
two weeks ago.

948
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:50,338
He told you?

949
01:29:58,382 --> 01:30:01,317
Chris, l want to know what
you think about his .

950
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:06,320
Dinner was cold, and...

951
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:11,393
Beagles just been shot,
and we were ambushed.

952
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,456
But, is not that strange.

953
01:30:15,533 --> 01:30:18,331
Letter was killed Mark.

954
01:30:18,402 --> 01:30:22,338
He just... he died, and
he paid the price.

955
01:30:33,484 --> 01:30:35,452
Signature here.

956
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:48,331
Hey, friend.

957
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:50,357
- Chris?
- Yes l Do.

958
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:52,426
- How are you?
- l'm here.

959
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:55,371
- Damn, you're blind as a bat.
- Yes, bullets jerk.

960
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,341
They said they
would fix my face.

961
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:01,435
Fortunately, we
tell them to fix .

962
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:03,310
Seriously.

963
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:05,540
- Too fast?
- Too fast.

964
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:08,518
- Hey, l heard you apply.
- Yes l Do.

965
01:31:08,552 --> 01:31:10,520
Congratulations.

966
01:31:10,521 --> 01:31:12,489
You did not tell him
that you buy diamonds

967
01:31:12,523 --> 01:31:15,287
- in that place, is not it?
- Do Not.

968
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:17,419
- No?
- Do Not. l bought a new one.

969
01:31:18,462 --> 01:31:21,397
- The smaller, and she likes.
- Nice One.

970
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:23,423
- Yes.
- Nice One.

971
01:31:24,268 --> 01:31:26,361
He will not leave me, bro.

972
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:30,398
l told him to go,
he did not want to.

973
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:34,241
He wants to be with me.

974
01:31:34,545 --> 01:31:36,536
Why do you say that?

975
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:39,311
Do not say that, he loves you.

976
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:44,321
- She was in love with you.
-Are you kidding.

977
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,282
Yes, l'm glad l have it.

978
01:31:49,393 --> 01:31:52,385
- l know you can handle it.
- Maybe you're right.

979
01:31:53,497 --> 01:31:57,297
They say you deadliest sniper
in US military history.

980
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:59,461
- Really?
- That's what l heard.

981
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:04,406
- You heard them say that?
- Yes l Do.

982
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:07,376
- You're not going back.
- Yes, we will hunt him down.

983
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:10,437
- Come on, you do not need to do that.
- We have to do it.

984
01:32:11,282 --> 01:32:14,445
You're my brother, and they had to
pay for what they've done to you.

985
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,250
How are you going to do?

986
01:32:19,423 --> 01:32:21,448
There mad.

987
01:32:27,331 --> 01:32:29,356
He survived.

988
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:32,264
He'll be fine.

989
01:32:32,303 --> 01:32:34,396
He did apply.

990
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,407
Do you want to die?

991
01:32:39,443 --> 01:32:41,411
lf that's what you want.

992
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:43,413
What?

993
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:46,278
Tell me.

994
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:50,281
Why did you do it? l
want to understand.

995
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:52,414
l do for you, l do
to protect you.

996
01:32:52,423 --> 01:32:54,482
- No.
- Yes l Do.

997
01:32:54,525 --> 01:32:59,394
l'm here. Here your family,
your children no father.

998
01:32:59,396 --> 01:33:02,490
- l have to serve my country.
- That's nonsense!

999
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:05,400
- No.
- You do not know when to stop.

1000
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:10,535
You've done yourjob, you're pretty
sacrifice, let someone else have a go.

1001
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,509
- Let someone else go?
- Yes l Do.

1002
01:33:12,543 --> 01:33:15,410
- l could not live.
- You've got to find a way.

1003
01:33:16,313 --> 01:33:18,440
You should do it.

1004
01:33:22,453 --> 01:33:26,412
Okay? l want you
to be human again.

1005
01:33:28,492 --> 01:33:31,359
l need you here.

1006
01:33:32,363 --> 01:33:35,298
They need you here.

1007
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:39,459
lf you go again...

1008
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:43,404
l guess we will not be there
here when you return.

1009
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:11,495
Chris.

1010
01:34:12,536 --> 01:34:15,505
We have 3 missions in a row.

1011
01:34:15,506 --> 01:34:18,475
lt would be worse.

1012
01:34:18,509 --> 01:34:21,478
- lt will be chaotic.
-Are you coming?

1013
01:34:21,512 --> 01:34:23,480
l think so.

1014
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,381
His wife scolded him.

1015
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:31,252
Once again my wife will kill me.

1016
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:33,485
- True.
- They do not understand.

1017
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:37,551
l went to the hospital
earlier, it was bad.

1018
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:40,386
He was already dead, Chris.

1019
01:34:41,398 --> 01:34:45,528
He was operated on yesterday,
die on the operating table.

1020
01:34:53,343 --> 01:34:57,279
lt Taya, leave a message.

1021
01:34:57,314 --> 01:35:00,283
lt's me, just want
to hear your voice .

1022
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,345
l think of things
that you say...

1023
01:35:05,422 --> 01:35:08,289
Tell the kids l love them .

1024
01:35:08,325 --> 01:35:10,384
l love you too.

1025
01:36:35,412 --> 01:36:37,471
Place.

1026
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:53,257
Come on.

1027
01:37:20,524 --> 01:37:27,293
Look, they believe it will
be able to help us win war.

1028
01:37:27,331 --> 01:37:32,428
Problem engineers designed so as
not to be defeated by a sniper.

1029
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:33,528
Where?

1030
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:37,431
-Approximately 100 miles.
- There is something else?

1031
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:40,409
- l do not know.
- Snipers will kill us.

1032
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:43,538
He could be anyone. We
just have to kill him.

1033
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:49,349
We've blocked 6 blocks from the
North region enemy, you will be in
front of the shooterjitunya.

1034
01:37:49,386 --> 01:37:52,480
- ln the middle of the desert storm?
- Bring your sunglasses.

1035
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:56,424
We must kill the sniper.
Understand?

1036
01:37:56,426 --> 01:38:00,419
- Be prepared.
- Yes, Sir.

1037
01:40:05,455 --> 01:40:10,290
- Safe.
- Going down. Come on.

1038
01:40:10,394 --> 01:40:11,554
Come on.

1039
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:19,493
Safe. The Way.

1040
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:26,339
Everything is safe.
Building is safe.

1041
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:08,511
There were coming. Hold shot.

1042
01:41:17,527 --> 01:41:20,496
ln the middle of a desert storm.

1043
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:02,404
- Caution!
- Take cover!

1044
01:42:05,275 --> 01:42:09,302
Shit. The shot of the East.

1045
01:42:14,451 --> 01:42:17,420
We are in the wrong position.

1046
01:42:18,488 --> 01:42:23,425
Not important. Hold fire.
There are people below us.

1047
01:42:55,425 --> 01:42:58,326
There is a target at 19 yards.

1048
01:42:58,328 --> 01:43:02,389
l can not see that far. Hold shot.
We could get caught.

1049
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:05,265
He's right, there's no point.

1050
01:43:05,268 --> 01:43:08,294
Correction, 21 yards.

1051
01:43:09,372 --> 01:43:12,307
More than 1 mile.
lmpossible to shoot, Chris.

1052
01:43:24,354 --> 01:43:26,322
That's it.

1053
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:31,518
l've got a target, change.

1054
01:43:31,528 --> 01:43:35,362
Understandably, troops will
soon arrive in 20 minutes.

1055
01:43:50,413 --> 01:43:53,473
- He oversees our friends.
- Can you confirm?

1056
01:43:56,453 --> 01:43:58,478
That's it.

1057
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:02,349
- There she is.
- Your decision, Chris.

1058
01:44:02,392 --> 01:44:06,328
Team will arrive within 20 minutes.
Hold shot.

1059
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:21,305
You have to kill him.

1060
01:44:23,313 --> 01:44:26,282
This is very important.

1061
01:44:26,483 --> 01:44:28,542
Will l do.

1062
01:45:02,452 --> 01:45:04,511
He screwed us.

1063
01:45:06,556 --> 01:45:10,458
- Tango fall.
- We need help.

1064
01:45:14,497 --> 01:45:19,264
- Mission accomplished.
- He oversees our people.

1065
01:45:19,302 --> 01:45:23,398
- Kill him.
- Yes, now we are stuck.

1066
01:45:26,276 --> 01:45:28,369
He would be proud.

1067
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:32,310
You did it, Chris.

1068
01:45:33,516 --> 01:45:37,452
Echo 7, there are near you.

1069
01:45:37,454 --> 01:45:40,389
White Side, damn.

1070
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:42,516
Yes, let's go.

1071
01:45:48,498 --> 01:45:54,528
We will come down from the roof.
Save your ammunition.

1072
01:45:58,508 --> 01:46:02,342
Quick attack!

1073
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:15,417
Quick ride!

1074
01:46:46,289 --> 01:46:48,416
Take cover!

1075
01:46:53,363 --> 01:46:56,457
Echo 7, no weapons
The Green Side.

1076
01:47:38,274 --> 01:47:43,405
We fired, White Side!

1077
01:47:51,454 --> 01:47:54,321
We have to move!

1078
01:47:54,357 --> 01:47:56,518
Do not stop shooting!

1079
01:47:57,494 --> 01:47:59,553
They will come.

1080
01:48:10,573 --> 01:48:13,542
- Where?
- Direction hours 3.

1081
01:48:13,543 --> 01:48:16,376
Only the remaining 1 clip.

1082
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:19,371
Hang in there! Anyone
have ammunition?

1083
01:48:19,415 --> 01:48:21,542
We can not hold any longer.
We have to move!

1084
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:25,282
- They stuck.
- We're heading down the road.

1085
01:48:25,288 --> 01:48:27,381
True, come on.

1086
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:31,454
- Call them.
- We need help.

1087

1088
01:48:35,331 --> 01:48:39,392
- That position.
- l know, drop it!

1089
01:48:39,435 --> 01:48:42,302
Viper 34, ready to attack.

1090
01:48:42,372 --> 01:48:45,500
Viper 34, replace. 30 seconds.

1091
01:48:56,519 --> 01:48:58,419
Hello?

1092
01:48:59,522 --> 01:49:01,387
Darling?

1093
01:49:01,391 --> 01:49:06,328

l'm ready to go home.

1096
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,298
What?

1097
01:49:19,509 --> 01:49:21,374
What happened?

1098
01:49:23,413 --> 01:49:26,314
l'm ready to go home, dear.

1099
01:49:26,482 --> 01:49:28,347
Chris?

1100
01:49:30,553 --> 01:49:34,250
Here is the danger. l
can not last long.

1101
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:38,351
- Command pilot shoot.
- Viper 34, gunshot.

1102
01:49:43,266 --> 01:49:44,460
Missed.

1103
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:48,531
Shit.

We have to move, hurry!

1105
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:00,509
We have to move!

1106

Come on! Fast!

Last person!

1111
01:50:58,274 --> 01:51:02,335
Let's get together!

1112
01:51:03,346 --> 01:51:05,405
Quick!

1113
01:51:16,459 --> 01:51:23,331

Where is Chris? She

Open the door.

1118
01:51:56,432 --> 01:51:59,265
Stop the truck!

1119
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:05,238

Really?

1127
01:53:42,305 --> 01:53:44,432
You're in Germany?

01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,341
Not. l'm here.

1129
01:53:48,511 --> 01:53:51,378
Near here.

1130
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,280
You've come home?

1131
01:53:53,516 --> 01:53:56,451
What are you doing?

1132
01:54:00,423 --> 01:54:03,290
l think it only took a minute.

1133
01:54:05,428 --> 01:54:10,456
Chris, children want to meet.
lt's been 9 months.

1134
01:54:18,374 --> 01:54:20,535
l'm going home.

1135
01:54:20,543 --> 01:54:22,477
Are you okay?

1136
01:54:23,379 --> 01:54:25,313
Yes.

1137
01:54:28,451 --> 01:54:31,284
Unfortunately, go home.

1138
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:34,389
We miss you.

1139
01:54:36,559 --> 01:54:38,527
Okay.

1140
01:55:19,402 --> 01:55:23,361
Chris? Dear?

1141
01:55:29,512 --> 01:55:33,346
l'm going out.

1142
01:55:40,356 --> 01:55:42,517
Come on, higher.

1143
01:55:42,558 --> 01:55:45,527
See your face, dear.

1144
01:55:45,561 --> 01:55:49,395
Good. Looks different.

1145
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:52,460
The game Tuesday.

1146
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:56,460
He will be in the team.
That would be great.

1147
01:55:56,472 --> 01:55:59,339
Crazy, right?

1148
01:55:59,442 --> 01:56:05,472
l go crazy when seeing
other children.

1149
01:56:06,449 --> 01:56:09,384
You could be the coach.

1150
01:56:12,288 --> 01:56:16,349
He will lose teeth, l
am a little anxious.

1151
01:56:16,392 --> 01:56:18,519
He says only you are
allowed to withdraw it.

1152
01:56:18,527 --> 01:56:20,518
Will you do it?

1153
01:56:38,381 --> 01:56:40,440
Chris?

1154
01:56:54,463 --> 01:56:58,331
l can pull out of
your wife's phone.

1155
01:56:58,334 --> 01:57:00,461
She stories about barbecue.

1156
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,438
That's a pity.

1157
01:57:03,472 --> 01:57:07,272
lt seems out of control.
Are you worried?

1158
01:57:07,276 --> 01:57:08,470
No, sir.

1159
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:12,379
So you do not worry
about that happening?

1160
01:57:12,381 --> 01:57:14,508
No, sir. l do not
worry about it.

1161
01:57:15,518 --> 01:57:18,351
l want to ask you, Chris.

1162
01:57:18,354 --> 01:57:20,413
How long did you
serve your country?

1163
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:25,386
- 4 mission, so...
-Approximately a thousand days?

1164
01:57:25,428 --> 01:57:27,419
Yes, sir.

1165
01:57:28,264 --> 01:57:35,295
You'll be surprised if l tell
AL note you kill more than 160?

1166
01:57:35,538 --> 01:57:42,535
Ever thought do not
want you doing there?

1167
01:57:42,545 --> 01:57:45,309
That's not me.

1168
01:57:45,514 --> 01:57:47,277
What about you?

1169
01:57:47,283 --> 01:57:51,276
l'm just protecting my friends. They
are trying to kill our soldiers.

1170
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,551
l am willing to die
to protect them.

1171
01:57:57,526 --> 01:58:03,396
The problem l feel sad for the
people who could not l save.

1172
01:58:05,334 --> 01:58:10,362
l want to be there,
but l'm here, stop.

1173
01:58:11,474 --> 01:58:14,272
So you want to save
even more people?

1174
01:58:15,277 --> 01:58:16,403
Yes, sir.

1175
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:21,374
You should go from here.

1176
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:24,385
There are many soldiers
who had to be rescued.

1177
01:58:29,425 --> 01:58:33,452
- Want to take a walk?
- Sure.

1178
01:58:33,462 --> 01:58:37,296
Okay. l want to
show you something.

1179
01:58:39,502 --> 01:58:45,338
l still smoke, do not get angry,
because save my right hand.

1180
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:46,501
How can it be?

1181
01:58:46,542 --> 01:58:51,343
When exploded, both hands
on the steering wheel ,

1182
01:58:51,347 --> 01:58:54,441
before it exploded,
my right hand

1183
01:58:54,483 --> 01:58:59,284
reached for a cigarette and put into my mouth.
When l turned it on...

1184
01:58:59,288 --> 01:59:04,385
explosion occurred.
Destroy entire left arm.

1185
01:59:04,393 --> 01:59:07,419
l'm lucky to have this.

1186
01:59:07,463 --> 01:59:11,297
My right arm injury,
but still there.

1187
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,327
-And you still smoke?
- Yes l Do.

1188
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:25,542
Missed. 3 inches to the right. Come
on, you can do better than that.

1189
01:59:26,515 --> 01:59:28,483
3 inches to the right?

1190
01:59:29,418 --> 01:59:31,409
lt is quite complicated.

1191
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:35,413
Vibration surprise. Not
like shooting paper.

1192
01:59:35,457 --> 01:59:39,518
- You can not confuse me?
- Kenai only target.

1193
01:59:41,363 --> 01:59:43,456
- Kena.
- Right in the middle.

1194
01:59:44,366 --> 01:59:47,426
Shit, as had the courage back.

1195
01:59:48,504 --> 01:59:51,371
Why did you do it?

1196
01:59:51,407 --> 01:59:55,503
- l know you have a family.
- l hear you collect shoes.

1197
01:59:55,511 --> 01:59:58,503
l see we are the same size.

1198
01:59:58,547 --> 02:00:02,347
Really, why did you do it?

1199
02:00:02,351 --> 02:00:04,478
We look after each other, right?

1200
02:00:04,553 --> 02:00:07,317
Try shooting again.

1201
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:10,458
Come on, you can.

1202
02:00:12,294 --> 02:00:14,421
- Kena.
- Nice One.

1203
02:00:19,435 --> 02:00:20,493
Shit.

1204
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:24,266
Who is legend now?

1205
02:00:25,274 --> 02:00:28,539
You do not want that title.
Trust.

1206
02:00:33,382 --> 02:00:36,283
Help me.

1207
02:00:39,288 --> 02:00:41,518
-Again?
- Yes l Do.

1208
02:00:42,291 --> 02:00:44,418
- Bring into.
-All Right.

1209
02:01:07,383 --> 02:01:09,317
Come here.

1210
02:01:12,354 --> 02:01:14,413
Life here is not bad, right?

1211
02:01:14,456 --> 02:01:16,481
He smiled.

1212
02:01:16,558 --> 02:01:19,356
Looks happy.

1213
02:01:19,428 --> 02:01:21,453
Just do the habit.

1214
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:26,301
Not think of the other.

1215
02:01:35,544 --> 02:01:38,308
Who is it?

1216
02:01:38,314 --> 02:01:42,410
- Dear! That you?
- Yes dear.

1217
02:01:42,451 --> 02:01:46,478

1218
02:01:46,488 --> 02:01:51,255
- Honey, l'm sorry. What happened?
- No problem.

1219
02:01:53,262 --> 02:01:56,493
You know about it, right?

1220
02:01:57,299 --> 02:01:58,357
Yes.

1221
02:01:58,367 --> 02:02:01,393
That's what we'll do
for the first time.

1222
02:02:01,403 --> 02:02:03,371
Okay.

1223
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:06,306
Remember, you must be calm.

1224
02:02:06,342 --> 02:02:08,310
Confidence.

1225
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:10,471
And do not hesitate.

1226
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:14,278
-All right.
- There is a problem?

1227
02:02:14,283 --> 02:02:15,443
- l understand.
- You feel good?

1228
02:02:15,484 --> 02:02:17,281
Yes.

1229
02:02:33,302 --> 02:02:34,530
Hands, Miss.

1230
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:38,267
Put your hands.

1231
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:41,275
Put it.

1232
02:02:41,477 --> 02:02:46,278
Slowly.

1233
02:02:46,315 --> 02:02:50,274
- Honey, look at you.
- Look at you.

1234
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:53,320
Can l say something?

1235
02:02:53,355 --> 02:02:55,414
Tell to judge.

1236
02:02:56,325 --> 02:02:58,452
No, l'm very proud of you.

1237

l know it's difficult
for you to return.

1240
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:13,399
Course.

1241
02:03:15,277 --> 02:03:18,508
Tell one thing, you beg for it?

1242
02:03:18,514 --> 02:03:21,312
Yes, ma'am. l beg of them.

1243
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:26,287

1244
02:03:26,321 --> 02:03:28,482

But l want to look
