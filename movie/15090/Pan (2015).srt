1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,120
我要给你们讲的这个故事
I'm going to tell you a story

2
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,970
里面有个永远长不大的男孩儿
about a boy who would never grow up,

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,130
一个一心要除掉他的海盗
about the pirate who wished to kill him,

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,490
还有座精灵遍布的岛屿
about the island where fairies roamed.

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,480
但跟你之前听过的版本不一样
But this isn't the story you've heard before,

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,960
因为有时朋友是不打不相识的对手
because sometimes friends begin as enemies,

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
有时敌人  是反目的朋友
and enemies begin as friends.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,800
有时要想真正理解故事的结局
Sometimes to truly understand how things end,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
首先得了解它的开始
we must first know how they begin.

10
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,280
永远谨慎的修女

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,330
我爱你  我的彼得

快点  起床了
Come on, now.

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,290
这就对了  快起床
That's it. Come on.

走了走了  动作快
Move along. Come on, quickly now.

20
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,000
12年后  伦敦  第二次世界大战
.
.

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,690
彼得  我们要错过早餐了
Peter, we'll miss breakfast.

22
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,890
英雄归来  他们得填饱肚子
The heroes have risen. They must now feed!

23
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
那边安静点儿
Quiet over there!

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
我说安静
I said quiet!

25
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,880
马上吃了它
Eat that up! Now.

26
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,800
别让再我重复
I won't tell you again!

27
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,080
熏肉呢
Where's the bacon?

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,680
周末都有熏肉皮的
We always have bacon rind of a weekend.

29
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,800
正打仗呢  彼得  限量供应
There's a war on, Peter. Rationing.

30
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,840
你们能有东西吃就不错了
You're lucky to have any food at all.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,040
巴拿巴院长  原谅我
Oh! Mother Barnabas, forgive me.

32
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
让开
Get over there.

33
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,080
你赌不赌她肯定是私吞了所有配给
How much you wanna bet she's nickin' all the rations?

34
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,730
嘘  小点儿声  她会听到的
Shh. She'll hear ya.

35
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,490
她的耳朵和大象一样
She's got ears like an elephant.

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
屁股也像
Bum like one, too.

37
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
你看
Look.

38
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,400
空座位更多了
More empty seats.

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,920
尼尔森和比利都被撤离了
Nelson and Billy both got evacuated.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
幸运的家伙
Lucky sods.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
两个都走了吗
Both of them?

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
-什么时候  -不知道
- When? - Don't know.

43
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,400
我醒来的时候  他们都走了
When I woke up, they were both gone.

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,880
去了加拿大的一个家庭  等战争结束
Off to some family in Canada until the war's over.

45
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
我觉得去那也挺好的
I wouldn't mind goin' there.

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,680
别傻了  你就好好待在这儿吧
Don't be daft. You gotta stay put.

47
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,680
等咱们妈妈来接咱们吗
For when our mums come fetch us?

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
没错
Exactly.

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,970
我们据守这里  保卫要塞
We hunker down here. Hold the fort.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,800
等待骑兵部队的到来
Wait for the cavalry.

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
去房顶把那些肮脏的檐槽打扫干净
Now, get on that roof and clean those filthy gutters.

52
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
这安全吗  巴拿巴院长
Is it safe, Mother Barnabas?

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
我倒是没有亲自检查过
Well, I've not tested it meself, like.

54
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
最近没有
You know, not recently.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,730
但是孤儿坠楼死亡需要的
But all the necessary paperwork is in order

56
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
文件手续我都一应而全
should an orphan perish in a fall.

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,050
马上给我上去
Now get up there!

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,090
等你上去了也就离上帝更进了
And while you're aloft and closer to our Lord,

59
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,320
或许你可以反省反省你肮脏的灵魂
you may reflect on your festering souls.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,800
你那和枯叶一样腐败的心
Your souls that fester as do the leaves.

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,520
看吧  我就说了嘛
See! I was right!

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
她私藏了供给
She's hoarding all the rations.

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
她把那些食物都藏哪儿去了
Where's she hiding all the grub?

64
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,690
在她办公室  从没有人去过那儿
Her office. No one's ever been in there.

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,000
我听说  那儿还设了陷阱呢
I heard a rumor it's booby trapped.

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,760
安静  都给我安静
Silence, I said! Quiet!

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
所有人  都到防空洞去
Everyone, down to the shelters!

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,200
混乱里死路一条
In chaos is death!

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,040
-快来  -我觉得这样不好
- Come on. - I don't like this.

70
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,840
福特诺克斯
Fort Knox.

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,570
恶龙之巢穴
The lair of the dragon.

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
快过来
Come here.

73
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
拉住这里
So put your hands there.

74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
你的鞋给我  伙计
I need your shoe, fella.

75
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,200
-你能不能  -小点儿声
- Could you just... - Quiet!

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
好了
Right.

77
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,170
19
Nineteen.

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
20
Twenty.

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
彼得
Peter.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
额  这老修女真邋遢
Ugh. What a dirty old nun.

81
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
额
Ugh.

82
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,000
这儿也太脏了
This is so unhygienic.

83
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,840
但圣母玛利亚为什么却那么干净
Why is the Virgin Mary so clean?

84
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,440
-尼布斯  -下面
- Nibs? - Down here!

85
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,480
尼布斯
Nibsy!

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
我说了的吧
I told ya.

87
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
陷阱
Booby trapped.

88
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
宝藏哎
It's a treasure trove.

89
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
天哪
Flippin' heck!

90
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,690
彼得
Peter!

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,560
是档案
It's the records.

92
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
彼得
Peter!

93
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,810
你的资料
It's your file.

94
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,640
是你妈妈写的吗
Is it from your mum?

95
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,720
都写什么了
What does she say?

96
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,000
我看不懂
I can't.

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,440
你能读一下吗
Will you read it?

98
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,040
-不是默读  -哦
- I meant aloud. - Oh.

99
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
'我最爱的彼得"
"My dearest Peter."

100
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,800
"我所做的一切  都是因为我爱你"
"Everything I have done, I have done because I love you."

101
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,640
"我渴望哪天能回到你身边"
"I long for the day that I can come back for you"

102
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
"向你解释一切"
"And explain everything."

103
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,090
"不要质疑我"
"Don't doubt me"

104
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,240
"最重要的是  不要质疑你自己"
"Nor most importantly, don't doubt yourself."

105
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,840
"你是独一无二的"
"You are extraordinary."

106
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
"远超你的想象"
"More than you can imagine."

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,360
"我保证我们还会见面"
"I promise that you will see me again,"

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
"这个世界  或另一个世界"
"in this world or another."

109
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,080
那是我的私人财产  还给我
That's my private property! Give it back!

110
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,610
告诉你  彼得
You know, Peter,

111
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,760
每个孤儿都以为自己很特别
every little orphan dreams he's special.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,600
幻想着妈妈欢呼雀跃的来找他们
That he'll be the one whose mother comes a-skipping back for him.

113
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
但是你的妈妈不会来
But your mammy's not for skipping.

114
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,960
为什么呢
And why is that, hmm?

115
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,560
因为你不够特别  彼得
Because you're not special, Peter.

116
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
就是对你自己而言
You're not even special

117
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,840
你都平庸无奇
in your own way.

118
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
你只是个被没有责任心  完全忘记你的存在的
You're just a nasty little creature abandoned by a feckless mammy

119
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,690
母亲抛弃的脏东西
who's forgotten you exist.

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,000
你个小野蛮人
Oh! You little savage!

121
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,960
手伸出来  两个人都罚
Hands! The both of ya!

122
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
他又没干什么
He never did nothin'!

123
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,360
他是从犯
He's guilty by association.

124
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
是痛苦降临的时候了
It is time for the pine.

125
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
喂  小竹竿
Oi, Skinny.

126
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,220
阿诺德和双胞胎
Arnold and the twins,

127
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,840
他们什么时候走的
when did they go?

128
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,080
我猜是昨晚吧
Me guess it were last night.

129
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
那些消失的孩子
All the missing children,

130
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,160
还有藏在她办公室的钱
all that dough hidden in her office.

131
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,930
巴拿巴打算干什么
What's Barnabas up to?

132
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,680
她在贩卖孤儿
She's selling orphans.

133
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,410
我就知道
I knew it!

134
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
我是说  她真的有吗  这不好哎
I mean, is she? That's not nice.

135
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,610
但谁会大晚上的买孤儿呢
But who in the world buys orphans at night?

136
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,250
这就是我们要调查的
That's what we have to find out.

137
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,800
快来  咱俩制定个计划  一定很有趣
Now, come on, let's make a plan. It'll be fun.

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,490
这话真耳熟
I've heard that one before.

139
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,960
谁放屁了
Cor! Who guffed one?

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
尼布斯
Nibsy!

141
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
才不是我
I never.

142
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,360
这计划真傻  我回去睡觉了
This was a stupid plan. I'm going back to bed.

143
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,480
走吧
Come on.

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
真实  存在的精灵
Real, actual fairies.

289
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
嘿  新来的
Hey, new kid,

290
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,520
你刚才坐着海盗船来到这儿
you just got here on a flying pirate ship.

291
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,330
真实  对你来说是个抽象概念
"Real" should be a very fluid concept for you right now.

292
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
赶紧挖吧
Get to diggin'.

293
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,200
把你的镐给我  小鬼
Give me your pick, kid.

294
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,760
你的手满是伤是因为你的刀刃钝了
Your hand's all messed up because your blade is blunted.

295
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,910
你要继续这样捣
If you keep swingin' like that,

296
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,440
会伤到你的手腕
you're gonna break your wrist.

297
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
我叫彼得
I'm Peter.

298
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,760
你来这儿多久了
How long have you been here?

299
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,160
永恒一样久
Forever.

300
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,350
你知道他们为什么那么想得到它吗
Do you know why they want it so badly?

301
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,320
仙尘
The Pixum?

302
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,480
你的问题太多了  小子
You ask too many questions, kid.

303
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,320
他们为它而杀戮  我们为它而牺牲
They kill for it. We die for it.

304
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
故事结束
End of story.

305
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,440
-非常感谢  -不用谢我
- Thanks very much. - Don't thank me.

306
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
我不关心你
I don't care about you.

307
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,200
我不是你朋友  也不会照顾你
I'm not your friend, and I haven't got your back.

308
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,480
就这么简单
Simple as that.

309
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,530
走开  小孩
Shoo, kid.

310
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,200
精灵尘
Fairy dust.

311
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,480
我找到一颗
I found some.

312
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
那是我的
That's mine!

313
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
不
No!

314
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,200
我找到一颗
I found some!

315
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,520
小偷  那是我找到的
Oi, thief! I found it!

316
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,360
小屁孩  闭嘴
Oi, small fry, button it.

317
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
躲开
Move!

318
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
给我
Give it to me.

319
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
是我找到的仙尘
It was me! I found the Fairy Pixum!

320
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
被这个混蛋抢走了
This bogey stole it.

321
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,840
他说是他找到的
He said he found it.

322
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,240
那就是他找到的  清楚不
That means he found it. Clear?

323
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,920
跟你那张丑脸上的伤疤一样清楚
Clear as the scar on your ugly face!

324
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,360
带他去见船长  扰乱秩序  出言不逊
Take him to the Captain! Disorder and verbals.

325
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,720
让开  让开
Move out of the way. Move it.

326
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
让开
Get out of the way!

327
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
这  这是有程序的
There... There is a procedure for this, you know.

328
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,520
你不该...
You're not supposed to...

329
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
-闭嘴  写字板先生  -哦
- Shut it, Mr. Clipboard. - Oh!

330
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,040
看黑胡子怎么处理这可恶的小贼
Let's see what Blackbeard makes of this nasty little thief.

331
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,920
你看什么  我已经尽力了
Oh, what you lookin' at? I was tryin' my best.

332
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,400
继续  回去干活  谢谢
Well, go on, then. Back to work. Thank you.

333
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
你找到土著人的营地了吗
Did you find the natives' camp?

334
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,560
我们暴露了  先生
They found us, sir.

335
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,100
他们从树林里突袭出来
They sprang from the trees

336
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,600
杀了40个我们最强的战士
and laid waste to 40 of our most formidable men.

337
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,830
然后他们钻回森林
Then they disappeared back

338
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,520
消失得无影无踪
into the forest as if they were never there.

339
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,880
我们会找到他们的  船长
We will get them, Captain.

340
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,690
给点时间
Given the proper time.

341
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,760
时间
Time?

342
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
我都把这些矿榨干了
I have sucked these mines dry.

343
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,440
已经所剩无几  我必须占领他们的土地
There's almost nothing left. I must have their lands.

344
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
可这些野蛮人还能不断地伏击我的船
But these savages continue to ambush my ships,

345
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,490
从某个没人能找到的
operating from some hidden camp,

346
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,640
隐蔽营地操作
which no one can seem to find.

347
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,400
就这样你还跟我保证
And yet you assure me

348
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,440
再给点时间  你就能搞定一切
all will be well given the proper time.

349
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,600
没时间了  没有
There is no time! None!

350
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
打扰一下  船长
Excuse me, Captain.

351
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,610
嘿吼
Hey ho.

352
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,450
表演必须继续
The show must go on.

353
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,080
矿工们看上去怎样
How do the miners seem?

354
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,120
肮脏  狂热  处在崩溃的边缘  先生
Dirty, feverish, on the brink of collapse, sir.

355
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,290
为什么非得这么难呢
Why must it be so hard?

356
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,440
那么
So...

357
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,840
今天我们要拿谁开刀
Who are we making an example of today?

358
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,000
*嘿吼  出发*
*Hey ho, let's go*

359
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,400
*嘿吼  出发*
*Hey ho, let's go*

360
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,130
*他们排着整齐的队伍*
*They're forming in a straight line*

361
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
*他们乘着疾驰的摩托*
*They're going through a tight wind*

362
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
不  不
No, no!

363
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,530
这是要干吗
What's going on?

364
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
你觉得呢
What do you think?

365
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,440
*他们迅速跳上后座*
*They're piling in the backseat*

366
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
*他们立刻热血沸腾*
*They're generating steam heat*

367
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,200
*和着节拍*
*Pulsating to the backbeat*

368
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,930
*闪电战波普*
*The Blitzkrieg Bop*

369
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,170
现在清楚了吗
Any clearer now?

370
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,440
嘿吼  出发
Hey ho, let's go!

371
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,490
嘿吼  出发
Hey ho, let's go!

372
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,680
永无岛的勇士们
Brave heroes of Neverland,

373
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,840
看看这些叛徒
behold these traitors.

374
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
我把他们的命运交给你们仁慈的审判
I entrust their fate to your gracious whim.

375
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,000
这个野蛮人
This barbarian...

376
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,690
在粮店偷盗时被抓
...caught stealing from the grain store.

377
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,160
在粮店偷叫时被抓
...was caught squealing from the grain store.

378
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
偷盗
Stealing.

379
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
-偷盗  -两次
- Stealing. - Twice.

380
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
两次
Twice!

381
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
-你们要释放他吗  -不
- Will you spare him? - No!

382
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,880
还是要弘扬正义
Or do you lust for justice?

383
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
正义
Justice!

384
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
-没错  -正义
- Yes! - Justice!

385
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,560
-他们有发慈悲的时候吗  -有的
- Do they ever have mercy? - Oh, yes. They do.

386
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,080
经常吗
Often?

387
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,170
出发
Let's go!

388
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
别回答
Don't answer that.

389
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,530
这个男孩才刚到矿上一天
This boy has been in our mines but one day

390
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,730
就已经证明自己有贼的潜质
and has already proven himself to be a thief,

391
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,240
是个捣乱头子  仙尘诈骗犯
a rabble rouser, and a Pixum fraudster.

392
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,560
-我不是  -回答我
- I never! - I ask,

393
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,600
你们会对这任性的孩子心慈手软吗
shall you have mercy for the willful child?

394
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,250
不会
No!

395
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,240
还是要对他严惩不贷
Or do ye be nasty?

396
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,560
严惩
Nasty!

397
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,240
严惩  严惩  严惩
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!

398
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
可惜
Alack.

399
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
民意不可违
The people have spoken.

400
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,040
想点开心事
Think a happy thought.

401
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,650
这是真的吗
I'll be darned.

402
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,400
真不敢相信  我能飞
I don't believe it! I can fly!

403
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,280
永无岛是个你永远醒不过来的梦
Neverland is a dream from which you never wake.

404
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,680
做过这样的梦吗
Ever had that one?

405
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,040
一个噩梦  你明知是假的
A dreadful nightmare you know is not real,

406
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,480
但你睡得太沉
but your sleep is so heavy,

407
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,120
太深  太香
so deep, so delicious

408
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,280
怎么也醒不过来
that you just can't wake up.

409
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,690
溺在了梦里
Drowning in sleep.

410
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,280
慢节奏的梦
Slow dream

411
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,800
溺亡在柔软  黑色的海洋里
drowning in the soft, black sea.

412
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,210
你知道那片海吗  彼得
Do you know that sea, Peter?

413
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,680
是死亡  孩子
It's death, boy.

414
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,360
对你低语
Murmuring to you.

415
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,560
那是我们的结局
It's where we end.

416
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,840
大多数人吧
Most of us.

417
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,690
要吃点巧克力吗
Would you like some chocolate?

418
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,560
童年并不愉快
Childhood ain't so jolly.

419
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,840
相反  很可怕
In fact, it's rather frightening.

420
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,400
是不是
Agree?

421
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,200
你勇敢吗  彼得
Are you brave, Peter?

422
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,450
我尽量
I try to be.

423
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,920
当然
Yes, of course.

424
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,280
你害怕吗
Are you scared?

425
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,720
害怕
Yes.

426
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
你以前飞过吗
Have you ever flown before?

427
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,400
没有
No.

428
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,160
那堵墙后面  有群野蛮人
Beyond that wall, there are savage people.

429
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,890
他们有一个古老的预言
They have an ancient prophecy

430
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,560
从精灵王国统治这个岛时就已存在
from when the fairy kingdoms reigned on this island.

431
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,480
预言说  有一个男孩
The prophecy tells of a boy born of the love

432
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
为精灵王子和人类女孩相爱所生
between a fairy prince and a human girl.

433
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,840
他会从这个世界消失
A boy who would be disappeared from this world

434
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,650
长大后再回归
until he was old enough

435
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,680
领导一场暴动推翻我
to return and lead an uprising against me.

436
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,320
预言说  这个男孩
A boy, so says the prophecy,

437
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,000
他会飞
who could fly.

438
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,000
你是来杀我的吗  彼得
Have you come to kill me, Peter?

439
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,520
我不相信睡前故事
I don't believe in bedtime stories.

440
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
"我...  我"
"Me... Me."

441
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,720
我保证你会再见到我
I promise that you will see me again,

442
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,560
这个世界  或另一个世界
in this world or another.

443
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
"或另一个世界"
"Or another."

444
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,360
走  进去
Go on! Get in there!

445
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,520
或另一个世界
"Or another."

446
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
-小飞孩  -怎么了
- Hey, flyboy. - Yeah?

447
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,560
你这场飞行表演不错啊
That was some little airshow you put on out there.

448
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,410
你能再飞一次吗
Could you do that again?

449
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,760
问话的是谁
Who wants to know?

450
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,760
我当然能飞  你见过的
Of course I can fly. You saw me.

451
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
很好
Good.

452
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,080
把你的耳朵贴到那边的墙上
Put your ear to that wall over there.

453
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,300
你听到的是我贴到墙外的
Now that's the sound of a blast cap

454
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,760
定时炸弹声
I stuck to the other side.

455
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
设置为30秒后爆炸
Set to go off in 30 seconds.

456
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,610
要是我能飞  你会帮我找到妈妈吗
If I fly, you'll help me find my mother?

457
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
我知道她肯定在这座岛上
I reckon she's here on the island.

458
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
这不是谈判  孩子
It's not a negotiation, kid.

459
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,240
没有我  你都逃不出这牢房
Without me, you're stuck in this cell.

460
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,240
没有我  你也逃不出这矿区
Without me, you're stuck in these mines.

461
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
好吧  我们以后讨论一下
Okay, then we'll talk about it.

462
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,360
现在离那堵墙远点
Just move away from that wall

463
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
不然你会被炸到
before you get yourself blown up, all right?

464
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,640
-那你到底答不答应  -孩子
- So, what's it gonna be? - Kid!

465
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
嘀哒
Tick

466
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
滴答
tock.

467
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,240
好吧  成交  只要你
Okay, we have a deal, just...

468
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,890
小飞孩
Flyboy?

469
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,120
快  滑下去  他们会来追我们的
Hurry! Slide down. They'll be comin' for us.

470
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,610
要让我相信你  我得先知道你的名字
If I'm gonna trust you, I need to know your name.

471
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,160
虎克  我叫詹姆斯·虎克
It's Hook. The name's James Hook.

472
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,000
-高兴了吧  -不
- Happy? - No!

473
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,560
左脚放在右脚前
Left foot in front of the other,

474
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,920
右脚放在左脚前
put the right one in front of the other.

475
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,800
就这样  这叫走路  走  继续
That's it. It's called walking. Off you go. Go on.

476
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,160
斯密
Smee.

477
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,800
继续  别停
Well, go on, then. Carry on.

478
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
斯密  下面
Smee. Down here!

479
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,960
6点钟方向
Six o'clock.

480
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,360
我不...  是...
I don't... Yes...

481
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,160
该死  斯密  篮子里
Darn it, Smee, in the basket.

482
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,000
请别叫我斯密
Please don't call me Smee.

483
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,520
斯密  能送我去楼顶吗
Smee, can you get me to the surface?

484
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,200
没用的
There is no use.

485
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,120
上去了之后  也没别的路可走了
Once you're up there, you can't get anywhere else.

486
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,200
今天不一样
Not today.

487
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
认识你真好
Good knowing ya.

488
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,850
你一直都是真朋友
You've been a true friend.

489
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,840
某天我会想办法报答你
Someday I'll find a way to repay you.

490
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,720
现在  把我们送上去吧
Now, send us up.

491
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,360
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

492
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
你刚才说某天你会想办法报答我
You just said someday you'll find a way to repay me.

493
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,560
某天  不是今天  出去
Someday, not today. Get out!

494
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,400
我觉得这只是个说法问题
I think that's a very minor technicality.

495
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,720
某天也可以是今天  你想想看
Someday could be today, if you think about it.

496
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,960
-再说...  -斯密
- And, moreover... - Smee!

497
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,240
遵命
Yes.

498
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
我们要去那里
That's where we're headed.

499
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,680
直升机场
The Skyport.

500
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,080
我们可以坐缆车到码头
We can take one of the cable cars up to the dock.

501
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
然后你可以带我们飞到船上
Then you'll fly us to a ship.

502
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,920
行吗
Okay?

503
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,610
躲好了  孩子
Keep your head down, kid.

504
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
走  走
Go! Go!

505
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,640
看见没  他们把帆船停得里码头很远
See? They anchor the galleons far enough off the dock,

506
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
这样就没人能偷走了
so they're impossible to steal.

507
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,640
你的意思是让我从码头飞到其中一个
So you want me to fly from the dock, over to one of the...

508
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,650
什么  赶紧说  不然就永远别说
What? Speak now, or forever hold your peace.

509
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,680
我们应该停下来吗
Are we meant to have stopped?

510
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,160
用力  用力
Heave! Heave!

511
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
到不了直升机场了  你得现在就飞
Forget the Skyport. You have to do it now.

512
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
你在等正式邀请吗
Are you waiting for a formal invitation?

513
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,840
-跳  赶紧  -我恐高
- Go! Now! - I'm afraid of heights!

514
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,490
什么  你会飞啊
What? You can fly!

515
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,120
昨天是我第一次飞
Yesterday was my first time.

516
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,440
那你最好再飞一次
Well, you better fly again,

517
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,200
不然我们掉下去就玩儿完了
or we're all gonna fall for the last time.

518
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,160
我们能以后再争论这个吗
Might we bicker about this later?

519
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,640
斯密  给我剑
Smee! The sword!

520
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,200
那能行  孩子
Yeah, that's gonna work, kid.

521
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,800
上去对着他们挥舞
Get up there and wave it at 'em.

522
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
用力
Heave!

523
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,050
好险
That was close.

524
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,680
你会开船吗
Do you know how to work a ship?

525
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,840
那能有多难
How hard could it be?

526
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
-斯密  缆绳  -是  是
- Smee! The rope! - Yes! Yes!

527
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,080
-好了  -孩子
- Clear! - Boy!

528
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,920
开船比想象得难多了
This is a lot harder than it looks!

529
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,920
我们扬帆起航了
Yeah! We're sailin' now!

530
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,560
你有什么要说的吗
Well, do you have anything to say?

531
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,760
我花大功夫摆好的桌子
I worked really hard setting up that table.

532
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,440
什么  别管桌子了  以后再捡
What? Forget the table. Pick them up later.

533
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,040
要是男孩找到了土著人
If that boy makes it to the natives,

534
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,650
我们就没机会打赢这场仗了
you can forget any chance of us winning this war.

535
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
我们会失去一切
All will be lost.

536
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,520
我们会找到他们  他们走不远的
We'll find them, sir. They can't have gone far.

537
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,840
那你说他们在哪里
Well, then where are they?

538
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
抓住那个男孩  别让他落到野蛮人手里
Get me that boy before the savages do!

539
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,360
正前方
Dead ahead!

540
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,370
斯密  放开我的腿
Smee! Get off my leg!

541
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,920
我觉得我要吐了
I think I'm gonna be sick!

542
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,600
墙  墙
The wall! The wall!

543
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,370
有人吗  救命啊
Somebody, please help me!

544
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,880
转向
Turn!

545
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,330
斯密  把帆撑起来
Smee! Get the sails up!

546
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,040
我们需要有强逆风才能开跳
We need a strong headwind to make the jump!

547
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,680
跳哪里
What jump?

548
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,880
回家  我们要离开这座该死的岛
Home! We're gettin' the heck off this island!

549
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,400
不
No-ho!

550
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,970
你说过我们要找我妈妈
You said we'd find my mother!

551
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,200
我不会离开永无岛的
I'm not leaving Neverland!

552
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,720
好吧  反正现在也走不了了
Well, not now, anyway!

553
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,640
把帆撑起来
Get the sails up!

554
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,120
帆
The sails!

555
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,850
这会有些颠簸
This is gonna be a little rough!

556
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
把帆撑起来
Put the sails up!

557
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,720
说了多少次
How many times...

558
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
我在返老还童的时候不要打扰我
I am not to be disturbed when I'm at the Rejuvenator!

559
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,320
什么事
Yes?

560
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,200
抱歉  船长  是那个男孩的事
I am sorry, Captain, but it's about the boy.

561
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,440
说
Mmm-hmm?

562
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,760
偷走的船掉进了Neverwood
The stolen ship went down in the Neverwood.

563
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,040
男孩丢了吗
So the boy is lost?

564
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,080
是的  男孩丢了
Yes, sir. He is a lost boy.

565
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,200
不过现在我们最优秀的战士在找他
But our best men are searching for him now.

566
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,460
你们这些蠢货
I am surrounded by imbeciles.

567
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,760
什么事都要我亲自动手吗
Must I do everything myself?

568
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,930
先生  您不能真的相信
Sir, you can't really believe

569
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,000
这个小孩就是预言中说的人
that this pipsqueak is the one.

570
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,530
他看上去没什么能耐
He hardly seems capable.

571
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,400
他妈妈看上去也没什么能耐
His mother hardly seemed capable either,

572
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,600
可把我们害惨了
and yet, here we are.

573
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,000
你答应过要帮我找到我妈妈的
The deal was to help me find my mother.

574
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,120
你差点就毁约  那真的很不好
You were gonna break it. That's very wrong.

575
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,480
不  是你先毁约的  你骗了我们
No, you broke the deal first. You lied to us.

576
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,930
没  我只是撒了个小谎
No, I fibbed.

577
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,760
我能飞  只不过不是每天而已
I can fly. Just not every day.

578
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,400
这艘船是我们离开这座岛的唯一希望
Our only way off this island

579
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,680
现在它粉身碎骨了  你满意了吧
and now it's in pieces. Satisfied?

580
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,680
是的  我非常满意
Well, yes. I'm quite content.

581
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,450
因为我不想离开这座岛
'Cause I don't wanna get off this island.

582
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,650
花这么多年做逃跑计划
All the years that I've wasted planning to get out.

583
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,250
全都泡汤了
All gone.

584
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,880
别翻了  这里不安全
Hey! Quit messing around. It's not safe in here.

585
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,800
每艘船上都有一张
Every ship has one.

586
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,040
一张什么
A what?

587
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,840
地图
A map.

588
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,240
这是什么意思
What does that say?

589
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,320
部落领土
"Tribal Territory."

590
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,130
没错
Exactly.

591
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,520
预言说  一个男孩会领导部落
The prophecy said, "A boy would lead the tribe."

592
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,600
那又怎样  你根本不关心
So what? You don't care.

593
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,040
我关心  继续说
I do. Keep going.

594
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,210
黑胡子认为预言是在说我
Well, Blackbeard thinks the prophecy is about me,

595
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,050
意味着我妈妈来自这里
which means my mum is from here,

596
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,760
意味着土著人可能知道她在哪里
which means the natives might know where she is.

597
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,720
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

598
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,080
那些野蛮人会直接杀了你
Those savages would just as soon kill you as help you.

599
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,480
-你见过他们吗  -没见过
- Ever met one? - No!

600
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,720
我也无此打算
And I don't plan to.

601
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,570
他们或许很友善呢  我不怕
Well, they might be very nice. I'm not afraid of 'em.

602
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,000
勇敢和自杀只在一念间  小子
There's a fine line between bravery and suicide, kid.

603
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,720
我要去找部落领土了  再见
I'm off to go find the Tribal Territory. Oh, goodbye!

604
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,440
他在森林里活不到一个小时
He won't last an hour out there.

605
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,640
那是他的问题  不是我们的
His problem. Not ours.

606
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,920
问题是  如果他真是命中注定的那个
Thing is, if he was the chosen one...

607
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,730
就算预言是真的  相信我  那也不是他
If that prophecy is real, trust me, he ain't it.

608
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,760
但如果他们以为他是的话
But if they thought he was...

609
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,720
他们相信他是的话
They believed he was...

610
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,260
我肯定他们会丰厚奖赏
I bet they'd handsomely reward anyone

611
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,560
把他带去给他们的人
who brought him to them.

612
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,080
他们没有船
Well, they haven't got a ship.

613
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,080
是  但他们可以弄到
Yeah, but they could get one.

614
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,320
谁打海盗的次数多得过原住民
Who's fought the pirates more than the natives?

615
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,880
如果有人能办到  那一定是他们了
If anyone could find a way, it's them.

616
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,610
记住了  我们找到那些
Just remember, when we find those

617
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,800
所谓友好的原住民以后
oh-so-sweet-natured locals,

618
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,200
不管是真是假  你都得说你是他们的救世主
true or not, you tell them you're their savior.

619
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,840
然后咱们就分道扬镳  明白了吗
Then, we'll go our separate ways. Got it?

620
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,600
你为什么想要离开这么好的地方
Why would you want to leave a place like this?

621
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,120
你要去哪
Where will you go?

622
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,680
我不知道  不过首先肯定是个
I don't know. Somewhere I'm a little higher up

623
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,640
我在食物链上方的地方
on the food chain, for starters.

624
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
那是什么
What was that?

625
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,490
食物链上方的东西
Somethin' a little higher up on the food chain.

626
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,920
好美啊  虎克  你看到了吗
Oh, that is pretty, Hook. Do you see that?

627
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,280
我们差点被海盗用大炮打下来
We got pirates tryin' to shoot us down with cannons.

628
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
从上千尺高空掉落差点摔死
Nearly falling a thousand feet to our deaths.

629
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,320
而且是两次  船也毁了
Twice. Shipwrecked.

630
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,600
可你看到这样的景色  你就会想
And you see something like that and you think to yourself,

631
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,680
"太值了"
"Oh, worth it."

632
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,960
你是个孤儿吗
Are you an orphan?

633
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,600
我妈把我抛弃了  这算吗
My ma left me. That count?

634
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,240
你记得她吗
Well, do you remember her?

635
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,500
我才不要浪费眼泪去想念一个
I'm not wasting tears missing someone

636
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,490
从不想念我的人
who never missed me.

637
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,240
也许她也想你呢
Maybe she does.

638
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,120
你怎么知道
How can you know?

639
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,170
你真相信你母亲在这里吗
Do you really believe your mum's here?

640
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,520
她给我留了封信  上面说
Well, she left me a note saying...

641
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,320
是啊  她给你留了封信
Oh, well, if she left you a note, sure.

642
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,720
就因为你妈不爱你
Just 'cause yours never loved you...

643
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
住口
Stop.

644
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,200
不代表我妈从没爱过我
...doesn't mean my mum never loved me.

645
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,840
给我闭嘴
Stop talking right now.

646
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,570
你听见了吗
Did you hear that?

647
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,250
那噩梦一般的吼叫震耳欲聋
It was a deafening nightmare shriek.

648
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,120
怎么会有人听不见
How can anyone not have heard...

649
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,120
那是只永无鸟
That's a Neverbird.

650
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,360
那只也是
And so is that.

651
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
我们怎么办
What're we gonna do?

652
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,240
我们得想个办法  我们得想个办法
We need a plan. We need a plan!

653
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,080
跑
Run!

654
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,520
跑到雾里就能甩掉他们  快跑
We'll lose them in the mist! Go!

655
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,520
快跑
Go!

656
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,330
快跑  斯密
Run, Smee!

657
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,760
它们的脸很丑  但羽毛好漂亮
Their faces are terrible, but their feathers are quite lovely.

658
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,290
闭嘴快点跑
Shut up and run!

659
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,760
快跑
Go!

660
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,640
斯密
Smee!

661
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,040
彼得
Peter!

662
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
虎克  是你吗
Hook? Is that you?

663
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,240
彼得
Peter.

664
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,200
虎克  它们抓走了斯密
Hook, they've got Smee.

665
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,680
不
No.

666
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,600
别担心  一切都会没事的
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right!

667
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,400
我就知道我们会找到原住民的
I knew we'd find the natives.

668
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,130
我们得救了
We're saved.

669
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,320
求求你了  我想回家了  求求你了
Please! I'm ready to go home now, please.

670
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,040
让我来
Let me handle this.

671
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,720
美丽的姑娘  我们别无恶意
Good fair lady. We come in peace.

672
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,760
我们还带来了宝贝
And with treasure.

673
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,920
请允许我自豪地为你介绍
May I proudly present to you...

674
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,440
潘
Pan!

675
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,880
潘
Pan!

676
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,240
潘
Pan!

677
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,800
潘  潘
Pan! Pan!

678
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,160
潘
Pan!

679
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,800
潘  潘
Pan! Pan!

680
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,480
潘
Pan!

681
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,120
斯密
Smee!

682
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,760
-斯密  -干吗
- Smee! - What?

683
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,000
他们在唱什么
What are they singing about?

684
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,520
我不知道
Search me!

685
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,690
潘  潘
Pan! Pan!

686
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
你们在干什么  "潘"是什么
What's going on? What's "Pan"?

687
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,480
潘是我们部落最勇敢的武士
The Pan is our tribe's bravest warrior.

688
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,120
我们的传统是在我们杀了你和你的朋友前
It's our tradition to grant you the chance to win

689
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,280
会给你们个赢得自由的机会
your freedom before we kill you and your friends.

690
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,080
杀了我们  你要杀掉我们
Kill? What do you mean, "kill"?

691
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,040
你们是我们不共戴天的敌人  你们是海盗
You are our sworn enemy. You're pirates.

692
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,600
海盗  我们不是海盗  等等
Pirates? We're not pirates. Hold on!

693
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,640
那孩子是你们一直在等待的人
The kid is the one you've been waiting for.

694
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
听我说
Listen!

695
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,010
你们活命的机会是
Your chance to live,

696
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,280
派你们中最善战的人与我们的潘对战
your fiercest fighter against ours. Our Pan.

697
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,680
你们赢了  就能活
You win, you live.

698
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,800
-输了  -我已经懂了
- You lose... - I get the idea.

699
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,360
再见了
Bye for now.

700
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,800
潘
Pan!

701
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,160
我们怎么知道什么时候开始
So how do we know when to start?

702
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,680
-斯密  -干吗
- Smee! - What?

703
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,960
我们得跟他们说我妈的事
We have to tell them about my mother.

704
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,080
现在没人在乎你那该死老妈的事
No one cares about your darn mother!

705
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,720
抱歉  说话有点重了
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

706
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,760
好吧
Okay.

707
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,720
公主殿下
Your Highness.

708
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,760
正想单独跟你聊两句呢
I was hoping to get you alone.

709
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,760
住手
Stop!

710
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,050
那个小家伙
The little one.

711
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,170
他戴着潘
He wears the Pan.

712
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,000
他是那个会飞的孩子
He's a boy that can fly.

713
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,080
我见过  棒极了
I've seen it. It's terrific.

714
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,760
我们称它为记忆树
We call this the Memory Tree.

715
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,040
那是战争的年代
It was a time of war.

716
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,440
黑胡子为了得到仙尘而摧毁了一切
Blackbeard destroyed everything in pursuit of the Pixum.

717
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,530
之后首领和伟大的精灵王达成协议
But then, the chief made a pact with the great fairy king,

718
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,290
要团结一致对付海盗
uniting our peoples against the pirates.

719
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,760
一天晚上  精灵王的儿子  精灵王子
One night, the king's son, the fairy prince,

720
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,120
溜到了黑胡子的船上
found his way onto Blackbeard's ship.

721
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,040
她叫玛丽  是黑胡子一生挚爱
Her name was Mary, the love of Blackbeard's life

722
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,120
也是他最珍视的所有物
and his most prized possession.

723
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,800
王子每晚都去看望玛丽
Night after night, the prince visited Mary.

724
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,230
当黑胡子发现后
But when Blackbeard discovered them,

725
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,480
他因嫉妒而恼羞成怒
he flew into a jealous rage.

726
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,920
为了救她  王子化为人形
So in order to save her, the prince took human form.

727
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,120
虽然精灵有千年寿命
But though fairies can live many thousands of years,

728
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,770
但化为人形后  他们只能活一天
in human flesh, they can live only one day.

729
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,970
王子为救心爱的姑而献出了生命
The prince sacrificed his life for the girl he loved.

730
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,210
而那爱情的结晶便是你
And the child of that love was you.

731
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,120
我们帮你母亲把你藏在了另一个世界
Our people helped your mother hide you in the other world.

732
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,640
他们给你做了这个图腾
And they made you this totem,

733
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,200
这样当你回来时  我们便能认出你
so that when you returned, we would know it was you.

734
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,800
我母亲后来怎么样了
What happened to my mother?

735
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,840
她回到了Neverwood
She returned to the Neverwood

736
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,690
为我们征战多年
and fought for us many years.

737
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,080
然后呢
And?

738
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,960
海盗节节胜利
The pirates were winning the war,

739
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,080
精灵们必须隐居起来
and the fairies had to retreat to a hidden kingdom.

740
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,690
他们一直留在那  隐藏着
They've remained there, in hiding,

741
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,100
不为黑胡子所知
unknown by Blackbeard until

742
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,920
直到有一天他们可以重返战场
a time when they can reemerge and fight.

743
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
我母亲呢
And my mother?

744
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,000
-她跟他们在一起  -她还活着
- She's with them. - She's alive?

745
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,320
你确定吗  我要去找她
Are you sure? I have to go to her!

746
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,210
-求求你  现在就带我去  -不行
- Please, take me now! - No.

747
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,330
你必须耐心
You must be patient.

748
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,760
但她在等我
But she's waiting for me.

749
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,880
精灵王国是这片土地上最大的秘密
The fairy kingdom is the greatest secret of this land.

750
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,360
我们的责任是守护这个秘密
Our duty is to protect it.

751
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,480
在我们带你去之前
Before we take you there,

752
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,450
你必须证明你就是玛丽的儿子
you must prove yourself to be Mary's son.

753
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,800
就是我们一直在等待的人
The one we've been waiting for.

754
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,000
第三天晚上的月亮升起时
When the third moon rises,

755
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,280
他必须飞
he must fly.

756
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,960
如果他活下来  他就是救世主
If he lives, he's the one.

757
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,720
等一下
One second.

758
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,120
要是他死了呢
And if he dies?

759
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,720
那他就是冒牌货
He's an imposter.

760
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,000
他是死有余辜
His death will be justified.

761
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,250
三天
Three days!

762
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,120
我有项链  这还不够吗
I've got the necklace. Isn't that enough?

763
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,560
有可能是你偷来的
You could've stolen it.

764
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,720
但我没有  你告诉她啊
But I didn't. Tell her!

765
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,480
这孩子一直戴着那东西
Kid's always had that thing.

766
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,280
你们认识他多久
How long have you known him?

767
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,890
-三天  -一辈子
- Three days. - All my life.

768
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,320
会飞的事只是个愚蠢的细节
The flying thing is a stupid detail.

769
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,880
他们怎么就不明白呢
Why can't they just see that?

770
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,560
如果你自己都不相信  彼得  那他们也不会相信
If you don't believe, Peter, then neither will they.

771
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,040
但如果你信  他们也会信的  我保证
But if you do, they will, too. I promise.

772
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,960
你是他们认为的那个人吗
Are you who they think you are?

773
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,920
我不知道
I don't know.

774
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,630
他们认为你是他们的救世主
They think you're their messiah,

775
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,240
你是来解放他们的
that you're here to liberate them.

776
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,520
他们以为的对吗
Are they right?

777
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,520
我说  我不知道
I said, I don't know!

778
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,530
兔子
Rabbits.

779
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,610
我相信
I believe.

780
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,040
我会飞
I can fly!

781
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,320
要是尼布斯在就好了
If only Nibs was here.

782
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,730
他会知道该怎么帮我
He'd know how to help.

783
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,560
我相信
I believe.

784
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,800
你见到了斯密吗
Have you seen Smee?

785
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,480
他们想让我做的事
These things they expect me to do,

786
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,960
我做不到  虎克  我试过了
I can't do them, Hook. I've tried.

787
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,200
-站住  -我做不到那些事
- Hey. Stop. Hey! - I can't do the things,

788
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,520
所以我不可能是救世主
so I can't be the one!

789
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,120
听着
Listen.

790
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,520
虎克  我到底是谁
Hook, what the bloody hell am I?

791
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,330
你想自怨自艾的话随你的便  小子
You can go feeling sorry for yourself all you want, kid.

792
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,050
但是知道你是从哪来的
But knowing where you're from,

793
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,840
这已经是了解你身世的一半了
that's half of knowing who you are.

794
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,960
已经比我们大多数人一辈子知道的都多了
That's more than most of us here will ever know.

795
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,840
可你说你母亲抛弃了你
But you said that your mother left you.

796
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,610
我骗你的  有时候我会撒谎
Yeah. I lied. I do that sometimes.

797
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,130
这就是成年人的世界
It's called being a grown-up!

798
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,570
至少你知道你是从哪来的
Least you know where you come from.

799
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,840
生来就是武士  王子的后裔
Born to a warrior, heir to a prince.

800
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,200
这意味着你就是救世主吗  我不知道
Does that mean you're the one? I don't know.

801
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,560
我不知道世界上到底有没有救世主
I don't know if there is a "One."

802
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,930
但我知道
But I do know

803
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,440
就算你不是那个人
that if you aren't the guy,

804
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,560
你只是你自己
and you are just you,

805
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,770
也许这就够了
maybe that's enough.

806
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,080
那孩子在哪
Where's the boy?

807
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,000
快说  不然我就杀了你
Spill the beans, or I'll spill your blood.

808
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,600
我绝不会说的
I'll never tell.

809
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,050
他就在那边
He's right over there.

810
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,640
不  不  稍等  我搞错了
Nope, nope. Wait, my mistake.

811
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,720
应该是那边  不
Pretty sure it's that way. No!

812
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,880
不  先转右
No. Right the first time.

813
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,600
绝对  也许绝对  是这边
Definitely, maybe definitely, this way.

814
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,200
我要说的就是  我们离得很近
The point is, we're very close.

815
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,250
把船准备好  象大副  杀了他
Ready the ships. Bishop, kill him.

816
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,400
不  等一下
No! Just wait!

817
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,760
等一下
Wait!

818
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,160
你也许现在还不想杀我
You might not wanna kill me just yet.

819
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,690
因为我有王冠上耀眼的明珠
For I hold the crown jewels, you know.

820
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
-比喻信息  -说
- Informationally. - Speak.

821
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,200
抱歉  有点紧张  你真的很吓人
Sorry, a bit nervous. You are quite intimidating.

822
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
说
Speak.

823
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,440
你知道所谓的灭绝了的精灵王国吧
Now, you know the so-called extinct fairy kingdom, hmm?

824
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,160
说
Speak.

825
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,890
抱歉
Sorry.

826
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,880
我只是在找你
I was just lookin' for you.

827
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,400
你找到我了
Well, you found me.

828
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,600
在矿里可没有这样的风景
Don't see things like that in the mines.

829
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,850
很美
Kinda beautiful.

830
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,760
你喜欢日出吗
So, do you like sunrises?

831
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,330
你这是在干吗
What is it you think you're doing?

832
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,400
我想我应该是在调情
Well, I think it's called flirting,

833
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,680
但如果你还得问  那我可能没做对
but if you have to ask, I might be doin' it wrong.

834
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,040
你不像我部落里的男人
You're not like the men from my tribe.

835
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,400
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

836
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,040
不  他们很诚实
No, they're honesst.

837
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,240
-强壮  勇敢  -勇敢
- Strong. Brave. - Brave.

838
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,440
你管这叫勇敢吗
That what you call it?

839
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,680
让我的小哥们一跃而死
Letting my little buddy take a leap to his death.

840
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,320
当他停止怀疑自己  他会飞起来的
When he ceases to doubt himself, he will fly.

841
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,720
我们怎么知道这个岛上仍有精灵存在
How do we know there are any fairies still left on this island

842
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,400
又或者只因他们见到他飞就会来帮战
or that they'll come help fight just 'cause they see him fly?

843
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,680
你必须信任我们
You have to trust us.

844
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,040
为什么  你们显然不信任我们
Why should we? You certainly don't trust us.

845
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,400
精灵王国的所在地绘在一副地图中
There's a map to the fairy kingdom.

846
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,840
我们用自己的生命捍卫它
We guard it with our lives.

847
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,040
当然有地图啦
Of course there is.

848
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,600
秘密王国怎么会没有一张秘密地图呢
Why wouldn't there be a secret map to the secret kingdom?

849
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,040
这不是游戏
This isn't a game.

850
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,860
你已看到黑胡子对永无岛
You've seen what Blackbeard has done

851
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,720
做的一切了
to Neverland already.

852
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,240
如果我们不阻止他
He'll reduce the rest of it

853
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,490
他会把剩余的地方都变成矿井
to nothing but mine pits if we don't stop him.

854
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,120
有人告诉过你  你的眼睛很美吗
Has anybody ever told you you have really beautiful eyes?

855
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,280
前甲板着火  准备绕行
Fire on the foredeck, prepare to come around.

856
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,400
泰格·莉莉
Tiger Lily!

857
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,920
你打偏了
You missed.

858
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,280
我们必须找到彼得
We must find Peter!

859
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,280
打死她
Shoot her!

860
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,440
-彼得  -虎克呢
- Peter! - Where's Hook?

861
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,000
这一切都是因为你
All of this because of you.

862
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,480
不  夸胡  等等
No, Kwahu, wait!

863
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,840
不用谢  快走吧
You're welcome. Now, come on.

864
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,280
快跑
Keep moving!

865
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,560
我猜你就是公主吧
The princess, I presume.

866
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,950
实际上  我只是个矿工
Oh, well, actually, I'm just a miner,

867
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,840
不过谢谢你的赞扬
but I appreciate the compliment.

868
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,280
象大副
Bishop.

869
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,880
快走
Go on.

870
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,000
把他们排成一排
Line them up.

871
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,720
从这下去
Down here.

872
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,440
我们这么多年来挖断了手
All these years digging our hands raw

873
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,410
也只找到小块的仙尘
for tiny lumps of Pixum,

874
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,750
现在我从斯密先生那里得知
and now I learn from Mr. Smee

875
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,160
你们知道哪里有整山的仙尘
you know where there's a mountain of the stuff.

876
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,680
棒极了
Nice as pie.

877
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,840
告诉我那男孩在哪
Tell me where the boy is and

878
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,530
怎么找到精灵王国  你就可以活命
how to find the fairy kingdom, and you may live.

879
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,160
死亡是最伟大的旅程
Death is the greatest adventure.

880
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,480
那么旅途愉快
Bon voyage.

881
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,040
为我们的新女首领欢呼
All hail the new Chiefette.

882
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,400
泰格·莉莉公主
Princess Tiger Lily.

883
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,600
万岁
All hail!

884
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,920
告诉他吧  不然他会杀了你
Tell him. He'll kill you.

885
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,640
他说的没错
He's right, you know.

886
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,720
乖鸟
Nice birdie.

887
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,770
-有张地图  -叛徒
- There's a map. - Traitor.

888
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
别杀她
Don't shoot her.

889
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,240
她跟我说精灵王国有张地图
She told me there's a map to the fairy kingdom.

890
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,520
叛徒  你怎么敢背叛我们  海盗
Traitor! How dare you betray us, pirate?

891
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,040
我是在救你的命  亲爱的
I'm trying to save your lives, sweetheart.

892
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,280
不会有下次了
It won't happen again.

893
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,090
是不会了  我可以保证
Oh, it won't, I guarantee it.

894
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,040
船长
Captain.

895
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,920
上啊  小子
Go, kid.

896
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,610
杀掉他们
Kill them all!

897
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,040
进攻  进攻
Attack. Attack!

898
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,200
不
No!

899
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,440
我告诉你件事吧  彼得
Can I tell you something, Peter?

900
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,640
你永远找不到你母亲
You'll never find your mother.

901
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,370
不  我一定会找到她
Yes, I will find her.

902
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,320
不  你真真找不到
No, you really, really won't.

903
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,760
你永远找不到  知道为什么吗
You'll never find your mother. Do you know why?

904
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,440
因为我杀了她
Because I killed her.

905
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,360
她死在我手里  死在这把剑下
She died at my hand. By this very blade.

906
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,160
和你的下场一样
As you will, too.

907
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,800
闭上眼睛  彼得  想想开心的事
Close your eyes, Peter, and think a happy thought.

908
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,560
太失礼了  阁下
Bad form, sir!

909
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,120
我们必须逃走  马上
We have to run, now!

910
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,080
不  我们得跳下去
No. We have to jump.

911
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,960
彼得  你受伤了吗
Peter, are you hurt?

912
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,560
我也没事  谢谢关心
Well, I'm fine, too. Thanks for asking.

913
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,920
别跟我说话
Don't speak to me.

914
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,290
是你害得我们
Because of you, everything

915
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,530
竭力保护的一切面临毁灭
my people have fought to protect  will be destroyed.

916
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,080
是你害得首领丢掉性命
Because of you, the Chief is dead.

917
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,120
-斯密才是叛徒  -他是你的朋友
- Smee was the rat. - He was your friend.

918
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,880
-我怎么可能知道  -你应该知道
- How was I supposed to know? - You should've known.

919
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,360
-对不起  -你应该知道
- I'm sorry. - You should've known.

920
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,720
如果是我错了  我道歉
I'm sorry if I did something wrong!

921
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,160
彼得在哪里
Where's Peter?

922
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,480
彼得
Peter.

923
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,520
你说谎
You lied.

924
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,680
-你们全说谎  -对不起
- You all lied. - I'm sorry.

925
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,960
所以这是真的吗
So, it's true?

926
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,450
一言难尽
It's complicated.

927
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,640
我母亲是生是死
Is my mother alive or isn't she?

928
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,690
黑胡子的话是真的
Blackbeard spoke the truth.

929
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
而你却骗了我
And you lied to me.

930
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,900
如果我们告诉你她死了
Had we told you she was dead,

931
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,640
你会放弃你的使命
you'd have walked away from your destiny.

932
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,610
不管你认为我是谁
Whoever it is you think I am,

933
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,840
或希望我是谁
whatever it is you expect me to be,

934
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,970
我都不是那个人
I'm not.

935
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,680
我也做不到
And I can't.

936
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,890
我不能...
I couldn't...

937
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,960
我不想看着你死
I didn't wanna watch you die.

938
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,160
那你应该闭上眼睛
You should've closed your eyes.

939
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,040
黑胡子一定还在搜查彼得的下落
Blackbeard won't stop searching for Peter.

940
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,880
这座岛上只有一个地方他不敢去
There's only one place on this island he wouldn't dare look.

941
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,960
人鱼湖  听起来不错
Mermaid Lagoon? Sounds pretty.

942
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,360
原来海盗怕美人鱼
So pirates are afraid of mermaids?

943
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,360
不  是怕徘徊在湖外的东西
Because of what we will pass through to get there.

944
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,040
鳄鱼
Crocodiles.

945
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,170
害怕了
Afraid?

946
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,840
没有  女士
No, ma'am.

947
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,080
快找地图  继续找
Find the map. Keep looking.

948
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,200
斯密让您满意吗
Does Smee please thee?

949
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
把这里翻个底朝天
Pull the place apart!

950
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,160
-斯密能否重获自由  -不  你太有用了
- So may Smee be free? - No, you're too useful.

951
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,360
但是斯密得到承诺...
But Smee was promised...

952
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,280
斯密应该停止以第三人称形容自己
Smee should cease to talk of himself in the third person,

953
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
-否则斯密会有麻烦  -是
- or Smee will be a non-person. - Yes.

954
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,280
我找到了
I found it.

955
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,760
这是一幅通往精灵王国的地图
It's a map to the fairy kingdom.

956
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,200
准备起航
Ready the ships!

957
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,880
我们必须比彼得先到
We must get there before Peter.

958
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,360
拿火把  它们怕光
Grab the torches. They're afraid of the light.

959
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,050
它们被吓跑了吗
Did we scare 'em off?

960
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,770
拜托  它们也会飞了
Oh, come on. They can fly?

961
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,810
继续挥动火把
Keep waving the torches.

962
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,520
那里
There!

963
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,640
彼得
Peter!

964
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,640
彼得
Peter!

965
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,440
我好像看到他了
I think I see him.

966
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,970
在哪
Where?

967
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,320
-抓住我的手  -救命  救命
- Reach for my hand! - Help! Help!

968
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,680
彼得
Peter.

969
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,160
怎么回事
What happened?

970
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,720
那是什么
What the heck are those?

971
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,160
不知道  但我觉得你应该会喜欢
I don't know, but I think you're gonna like 'em.

972
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,680
你说得对极了
You could say that again.

973
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,760
别走
Don't go.

974
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,520
-我去看看  -小心
- I'm gonna check it out. - Be careful.

975
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,570
谁还能比我更小心
Who's more careful than me?

976
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,880
对不起  我没有告诉你真相
I'm sorry I didn't tell you what happened to your mother.

977
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,120
但黑胡子的话也并非全是真的
But Blackbeard didn't tell you the whole truth either.

978
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,450
让我给你看
Let me show you.

979
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,800
美人鱼对这片水域施了记忆魔法
The mermaids charged these waters with memories.

980
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,930
你可以看到过去
You can see the past.

981
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,890
深呼吸
Deep breath.

982
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,120
没时间了
There's no time.

983
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,280
黑胡子的人快赶上来了
Blackbeard's men nearly have us.

984
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,310
去精灵王国
Go to the fairy kingdom.

985
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:42,360
躲起来  保护子民的安全
Hide. Keep our people safe.

986
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,400
你不该回来的  玛丽
You should never have come back, Mary.

987
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,000
然而你还是回来了
And yet, here you are.

988
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,320
宁愿和他们一起死也不愿与我一起活着
Ready to die for them rather than live with me.

989
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,720
不  玛丽
No. Mary.

990
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,570
不
No! No.

991
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,760
不
No!

992
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,280
她是位勇士
She was a warrior.

993
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,740
一位伟大的勇士
A great warrior.

994
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:40,080
她的牺牲至今鼓舞着我们
Her sacrifice still inspires us.

995
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,840
你认识她吗
Did you know her?

996
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,570
她是我师父
She trained me.

997
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,570
她会为我自豪吗
Would she have been proud of me?

998
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,610
会
Yes.

999
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,040
非常自豪
Very.

1000
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,960
可如果我无法像她那样呢
But what if I can't do what she did?

1001
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,520
如果我无法完成预言呢
What if I fail to fulfill the prophecy?

1002
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,760
如果你就不去尝试呢  彼得
And what if you fail to try, Peter?

1003
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,160
那你又算什么样的人
What are you then?

1004
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,640
你们快来看
You've gotta see this.

1005
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,960
船体稍微有些损坏
Now, the hull's a little banged up.

1006
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,090
看到那些牙印了吗  那些鳄鱼跳得真高
And see those teeth marks? Boy, those crocs can jump.

1007
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,440
待我修理一番  它就能继续航行
But once I get her fixed up, she's gonna be in good shape.

1008
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,080
去哪
For what?

1009
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,080
赶紧离开这座岛
To get us the hell off this island.

1010
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,600
你打算像懦夫一样逃跑
You're going to run like a coward?

1011
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,240
我并没有想到这个词
Well, I never really thought of it in those exact terms,

1012
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,930
不过就是这个意思
but, generally speaking, yes.

1013
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,480
你要逃去哪里
And where will you go?

1014
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,260
回家
Home.

1015
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,160
从哪来回哪去
It's, you know, where I come from.

1016
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,240
家不是你来自哪里就是哪里  你选的才是
Home's not where you come from. It's where you make it.

1017
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,800
那你帮我成家
So help me do that.

1018
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,920
在黑胡子进攻下的生还者也都在矿里了
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's attack is in the mine by now.

1019
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,690
我去过那里  我再也不会回去
And I've been there, and I'm not going back.

1020
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,360
不管为了谁或为了什么
Not for anything or anyone.

1021
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,120
如果你没有留下的理由那就离开
Well, if you have no reason to stay, then go.

1022
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,760
快走  让我们等死
Go now. Leave us to die.

1023
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,960
我不想让你死
I don't want you to die.

1024
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,960
我想让你和我一起走
I want you to come with me.

1025
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,440
如果我不呢
And if I don't?

1026
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,290
那是你的决定  我无权干涉
Then that's your decision. Not mine.

1027
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,360
孩子
Well, kid.

1028
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,960
看来又是我们两个人一队了
Looks like the old gang's back together.

1029
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,720
我们让船飞起来
Let's get this ship in the air.

1030
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,480
事先声明一点
Let's get one thing straight.

1031
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,510
我不是救世主
I'm not the chosen one,

1032
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:52,040
即使预言是真的  它指的也不是我
and the prophecy wasn't about me if it was ever real at all.

1033
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,160
但我是我母亲的儿子
But I am my mother's son.

1034
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,750
如果黑胡子
And if Blackbeard is going

1035
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:00,000
要毁掉我父母用牺牲所换来的一切
to destroy everything my parents died for,

1036
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,320
那么我会像我父母一样和他抗争到底
I'll stand against him to the last. Just like they did.

1037
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,400
带我去精灵王国
Now, take me to the fairy kingdom.

1038
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,130
跟首领说的一模一样
It's just as the Chief described it.

1039
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,920
这些是文字
These are words.

1040
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,080
-是什么语言  -一定是精灵语
- What language is it? - Must be fairy.

1041
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,960
我看得懂
I can read.

1042
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,720
我看得懂
I can read it.

1043
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,440
上面写了什么
What does it say?

1044
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,760
"此门为持钥匙之王子开启"
"Only the prince who bears the key shall pass."

1045
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,920
就这样
Just that.

1046
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,840
还写了些关于伟人死掉的无聊故事
Then some boring stuff about the great fallen dead.

1047
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,410
这说明我们需要钥匙
It means we need a key.

1048
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,240
所以我们白跑了一趟
Then this was all for nothing.

1049
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,760
我不这么认为
No, I wouldn't say that.

1050
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,840
"持钥匙之王子"
"The prince who bears the key."

1051
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,760
你还不懂吗  彼得
Don't you see, Peter?

1052
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
-我是...  -你有钥匙
- I am the... - You bear the key.

1053
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,080
我有吗
I do?

1054
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,200
一直都在你身上
You've had it all along.

1055
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,640
-她知道我会来找她  -没错
- She knew I'd come for her. - Yes.

1056
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,120
为了保护王国  母亲将钥匙传给儿子
Mum tries to protect the kingdom by giving son the key.

1057
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,810
我杀了母亲  却没能杀死儿子
I kill Mum, but fail to kill the son.

1058
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,800
儿子将钥匙给了我  无法保护王国
In turn, son fails to protect the kingdom by giving me the key.

1059
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,960
妈妈会很失望
Mum would be very disappointed.

1060
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,960
对吧
Wouldn't she?

1061
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,840
永恒在召唤
Eternity beckons.

1062
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,840
我将长生不老
I will live forever.

1063
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:03,680
快醒醒  太阳晒屁股啦
Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine!

1064
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,560
那就是我们要去的地方
That's where we're going.

1065
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,680
精灵巢穴
The fairy hive.

1066
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,770
毁掉那里  他们就全完了
Destroy that, and we destroy them all.

1067
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,530
太好了  太棒了
Yes! Oh! Come!

1068
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,560
快  快来
Come on. Come.

1069
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,920
她叫小叮当
Her name's Tinkerbell.

1070
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,890
我听得到她说话
I can hear her.

1071
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,650
他们一直在等你  彼得
They've been waiting for you, Peter.

1072
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,410
你们得赶紧逃出去
You have to get away from here!

1073
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,970
他要杀掉你们
He's going to destroy you all.

1074
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
我知道我该做什么  可我失败了
I know what I was meant to do, but I failed.

1075
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,090
对不起
I'm sorry.

1076
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,570
对不起
I'm sorry!

1077
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,920
伙计们  快烧死他们
All right, boys, let's burn them!

1078
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,440
烧死他们
Burn them!

1079
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,080
烧  烧  烧
Burn them, burn them, burn them!

1080
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,520
-把他们全烧了  -不
- Burn them all! - No!

1081
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,280
求求你  让我做什么都行
Please, I'll do anything!

1082
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,120
-求求你  -别求饶
- Please! - Oh, don't beg.

1083
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,600
什么都行
Anything.

1084
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,610
求饶太丢人了
No. It's bad form to beg.

1085
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,120
孩子  你的尊严在哪里
Where's your sense of honor, boy?

1086
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,960
跪下
Now, kneel.

1087
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,000
我叫你跪下
I said kneel!

1088
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,640
我是王子和战士的儿子
I am the son of a warrior and a prince.

1089
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,400
我永远不会对你下跪
I will never bow to you.

1090
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,800
如果你要杀我  那就动手吧
If you're gonna kill me, then get on with it.

1091
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,200
如你所愿
As you wish.

1092
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,680
你不需要这样
You don't have to do this.

1093
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,320
没错
No.

1094
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,400
但我很想这么做
But I really want to.

1095
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,160
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

1096
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,170
怎么老是他
Why is it always him?

1097
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
跳
Jump!

1098
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,840
你回来了  我以为你不在乎的
You came back! I thought you didn't care!

1099
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,360
我说过  有时候我会说谎
Like I said, sometimes I lie.

1100
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,560
快
Come on!

1101
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,280
我不能让黑胡子进入巢穴
I can't let Blackbeard get to the hive!

1102
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,210
左满舵
Hard to port!

1103
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,720
不介意我加入吧
Mind if I cut in?

1104
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,320
我们得帮她
We've gotta help her!

1105
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,920
你来掌舵
Take the wheel!

1106
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,440
尽量让船靠近他们
You're gonna get this puppy as close to them as you can.

1107
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,760
-好  -然后我跳过去
- Okay! - And I'll jump across!

1108
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,290
抓稳了
Hold on!

1109
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,730
船长
Captain!

1110
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,320
不
No.

1111
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,480
彼得  不要
Peter, no!

1112
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,360
不
No.

1113
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,240
一切都结束了  孩子
It's over, boy.

1114
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,240
过来
Come.

1115
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,360
你们  快抓住那女孩
You! Grab that girl!

1116
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,960
潘
Pan!

1117
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,480
我会飞了
I can fly!

1118
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,880
快看  虎克  我在飞
Look at me, Hook, I'm flying!

1119
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,920
好了  你有必要炫耀吗
All right, you don't have to crow about it.

1120
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,050
随你怎么炫耀  只要别把我掉下去了
Crow all you want! Just don't drop me!

1121
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,600
去吧
Go on.

1122
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:32,840
如果要打败他  那么我们得一起上
If we're gonna beat him, we're gonna do it together.

1123
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,650
听见了吗
Do you hear me?

1124
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,800
很好
Good!

1125
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,600
准备冲啊
Now, come on, then.

1126
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,920
开火
Fire!

1127
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,200
准备好了吗
Ready?

1128
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,320
冲啊
Go!

1129
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,240
抓住你了
Got you!

1130
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,240
想想开心的事
Think a happy thought.

1131
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,120
不
No!

1132
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,600
孩子
Boy!

1133
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,800
你好
Hello.

1134
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,440
彼得
Peter.

1135
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,440
彼得
Peter.

1136
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,840
母亲
Mum?

1137
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,280
你找到了我
You found me.

1138
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,000
我的眼睛和你一样
I have your eyes.

1139
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,720
你的心和我一样
You have my heart.

1140
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,120
这是我梦寐以求的时刻  现在...
I've imagined this moment my whole life, and now...

1141
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,170
我爱你  母亲  十分爱你
I love you, Mum. So much.

1142
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,800
我不懂为什么会想念一个素未谋面的人
I don't know how you can miss someone you've never met,

1143
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,200
但我每天都在想你
but I've missed you every day.

1144
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,640
每天
Every day?

1145
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,480
没有你  我会再次迷失自我
Without you, I'm lost again.

1146
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,640
我现在要怎么做
What do I do now?

1147
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,480
你没有迷失
You're not lost.

1148
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,850
你找到了家
You are home.

1149
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,360
在这座岛上  和这些人
On this island, with these people.

1150
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,160
你的子民
Your people.

1151
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,880
你的家人
Your family.

1152
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:45,170
永远不要放弃他们  正如你不曾放弃过我
You must never give up on them, as you never gave up on me.

1153
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,040
但是  母亲
But, Mum,

1154
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,000
我不想再次失去你
I don't want to lose you again.

1155
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,010
你永远不会失去我
You'll never lose me.

1156
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,440
我永远都是永无岛的一部分
I'll always be part of this Neverland.

1157
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,850
也是你的一部分
And a part of you.

1158
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,600
我爱你  儿子
I love you, my son.

1159
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,720
我的彼得
My Peter.

1160
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,200
我的彼得·潘
My Peter Pan.

1161
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,610
彼得
Peter.

1162
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,800
彼得
Peter?

1163
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,130
你以为我会丢下你吗
You thought I'd leave you here.

1164
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,360
-我从未这么想  -想开心一下吗
- No, I never. - Feel like some fun?

1165
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,920
好啊
Yes, please.

1166
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,480
好的  先生们
All right, gentlemen.

1167
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,290
-抓稳了  -彼得
- Hold on tight. - Peter!

1168
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,840
你没有绳子
You don't have a rope.

1169
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,360
我有好多话要和你说
We have a lot to talk about.

1170
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,720
我以为你要离开
I thought you were leaving.

1171
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,040
改变主意了
Change of heart.

1172
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,160
麻烦你掌舵  谢谢
Will you take the wheel, please?

1173
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,400
你不想回家吗
You don't want to go home?

1174
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,440
我已经到家了
I already am.

1175
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,880
他也是海盗吗
Is he a pirate, too?

1176
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,520
不
No.

1177
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,360
至少还不是
Not yet, anyway.

1178
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,280
我们要去哪里
Which way shall we go?

1179
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,600
-设定航线  -设定航线
- Set a course! - Set a course!

1180
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,080
谁才是老大
Hey, who's in charge here?

1181
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,400
我是船长
Well, I'm the captain.

1182
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,600
而我是救世主
And I'm the chosen one.

1183
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,120
我们有的是时间去争论  小飞侠
We'll have plenty of time to argue about that later, flyboy.

1184
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,480
随便你  虎克船长
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.

1185
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,600
设定航线
Set a course.

1186
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,400
驶向右边第二颗星星  一直到天明
Second to the right and straight on till morning.

1187
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,250
永无岛
Neverland!

1188
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,560
永无岛
Neverland!

1189
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,920
我们永远是朋友  对吧  虎克
We'll always be friends, Hook. Won't we?

1190
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,680
当然  我们怎么会吵架呢
Always. What could possibly go wrong?
