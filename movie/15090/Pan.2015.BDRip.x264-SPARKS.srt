00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,120
<i>I'm going
to tell you a story</i>

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,970
<i>about a boy
who would never grow up,</i>

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,130
<i>about the pirate
who wished to kill him,</i>

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,490
<i>about the island
where fairies roamed.</i>

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,480
<i>But this isn't the story
you've heard before,</i>

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,960
<i>because sometimes</i>

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,960
<i>friends begin as enemies,</i>

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
<i>and enemies begin as friends.</i>

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,800
<i>Sometimes to truly understand
how things end,</i>

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>we must first know
how they begin.</i>

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,080
Come on.

13
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,720
I love you, my son.

14
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,770
I love you,

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,330
my Peter.

16
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
Wakey, wakey!

17
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
Rise and shine!

18
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,690
Come on, now.

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,290
That's it. Come on.

20
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,200
Move along.
Come on, quickly now.

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,690
Peter, we'll miss breakfast.

22
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,890
The heroes have risen.
They must now feed!

23
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
Quiet over there!

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
I said quiet!

25
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,880
Eat that up! Now.

26
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,800
I won't tell you again!

27
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,080
Where's the bacon?

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,680
We always have bacon rind
of a weekend.

29
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,800
There's a war on, Peter.
Rationing.

30
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,840
You're lucky to have
any food at all.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,040
Oh! Mother Barnabas,
forgive me.

32
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Get over there.

33
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,080
How much you wanna bet
she's nickin' all the rations?

34
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,730
Shh. She'll hear ya.

35
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,490
She's got ears
like an elephant.

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Bum like one, too.

37
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
Look.

38
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,400
More empty seats.

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,920
Nelson and Billy
both got evacuated.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Lucky sods.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Both of them?

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
- When?
<i>- Don't know.</i>

43
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,400
When I woke up,
they were both gone.

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,880
Off to some family in Canada
until the war's over.

45
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
<i>I wouldn't mind goin' there.</i>

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,680
Don't be daft.
You gotta stay put.

47
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,680
For when our mums
come fetch us?

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
Exactly.

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,970
We hunker down here.
Hold the fort.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,800
Wait for the cavalry.

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
Now, get on that roof and
clean those filthy gutters.

52
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
<i>Is it safe,
Mother Barnabas?</i>

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
Well, I've not
tested it meself, like.

54
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
You know, not recently.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,730
<i>But all the necessary
paperwork is in order</i>

56
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
should an orphan
perish in a fall.

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,050
Now get up there!

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,090
<i>And while you're aloft
and closer to our Lord,</i>

59
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,320
you may reflect on
your festering souls.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,800
Your souls that fester
as do the leaves.

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,520
See! I was right!

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
She's hoarding
all the rations.

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
Where's she hiding
all the grub?

64
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,690
Her office.
No one's ever been in there.

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,000
I heard a rumor
it's booby trapped.

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,760
Silence, I said! Quiet!

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
Everyone,
down to the shelters!

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,200
In chaos is death!

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,040
- Come on.
- I don't like this.

70
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,840
Fort Knox.

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,000
The lair of the dragon.

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
Whoa!

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
Come here.

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
So put your hands there.

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
I need your shoe, fella.

76
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,200
- Could you just...
- Quiet!

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
Right.

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,170
Nineteen.

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
Twenty.

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
Peter.

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Ugh. What a dirty old nun.

82
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Ugh.

83
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,000
<i>This is so unhygienic.</i>

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,840
<i>Why is the Virgin Mary
so clean?</i>

85
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,440
- Nibs?
<i>- Down here!</i>

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,480
Nibsy!

87
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I told ya.

88
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
Booby trapped.

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
It's a treasure trove.

90
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
<i>Flippin' heck!</i>

91
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,690
Peter!

92
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,560
It's the records.

93
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
Peter!

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,810
It's your file.

95
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,640
<i>Is it from your mum?</i>

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,720
<i>What does she say?</i>

97
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,000
<i>I can't.</i>

98
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,440
Will you read it?

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,040
- I meant aloud.
- Oh.

100
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
<i>"My dearest Peter.</i>

101
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,160
<i>"Everything I have done,".</i>

102
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,800
<i>"I have done
because I love you."</i>

103
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,640
<i>"I long for the day that
I can come back for you"</i>

104
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
<i>"and explain everything."</i>

105
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,090
"Don't doubt me"

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
"nor most importantly,"

107
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
"don't doubt yourself."

108
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,840
"You are extraordinary."

109
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
<i>"More than you can imagine."</i>

110
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,720
<i>I promise that
you will see me again,</i>

111
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,680
<i>in this world or another.</i>

112
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,280
Come on!

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,080
That's my private property!
Give it back!

114
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,760
You know, Peter, every little
orphan dreams he's special.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,330
That he'll be the one

116
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,600
whose mother comes
a-skipping back for him.

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
But your mammy's
not for skipping.

118
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,960
And why is that, hmm?

119
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,560
Because you're not special,
Peter.

120
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
<i>You're not even special</i>

121
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,840
in your own way.

122
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,720
You're just
a nasty little creature

123
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,800
abandoned by a feckless mammy

124
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,690
who's forgotten you exist.

125
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh! You little savage!

126
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,960
Hands! The both of ya!

127
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
He never did nothin'!

128
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,360
He's guilty by association.

129
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,880
It is time

130
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,600
for the pine.

131
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
Oi, Skinny.

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,840
Arnold and the twins,
when did they go?

133
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,080
Me guess it were last night.

134
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
All the missing children,

135
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,160
all that dough
hidden in her office.

136
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,930
What's Barnabas up to?

137
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,680
She's selling orphans.

138
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,410
I knew it!

139
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I mean, is she?
That's not nice.

140
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,610
But who in the world
buys orphans at night?

141
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,250
That's what
we have to find out.

142
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>Now, come on,
let's make a plan. It'll be fun.</i>

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,490
<i>I've heard
that one before.</i>

144
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,960
Cor! Who guffed one?

145
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
<i>Nibsy!</i>

146
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
I never.

147
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

148
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,360
This was a stupid plan.
I'm going back to bed.

149
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,480
<i>Come on.</i>

150
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
- Night.
- Night.

151
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,050
- Nibs!
<i>- Peter!</i>

152
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,680
I told you
it would happen tonight.

153
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,080
I was right!

154
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,170
What?

155
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,210
Head for the stairs.

156
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
Go!

157
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,480
Nibs!

158
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,400
Goodbye, Peter!

159
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,120
- You're comin' with me!
- Let go!

160
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,800
Peter.

161
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,960
Holy pudding!

162
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,490
Prepare to set sail!

163
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,610
We've gotta
get out of here.

164
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
<i>We'll have to jump.</i>

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,040
I can't!

166
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,720
<i>We have to!</i>

167
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
Come on!

168
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,000
Nibs!

169
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
And away we go!

170
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,570
Come on!

171
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Friends till death!

172
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,400
Peter!

173
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,200
Damnation.
You've sunk my frigate.

174
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,880
Ma'am. Luftwaffe. Inbound.

175
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,530
Ladies.

176
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,680
Sector 6, sector 8, sector 12.

177
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,210
<i>Incoming!</i>

178
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
Spitfire!

179
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
<i>- Clear the deck!
- Ready your swords!</i>

180
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,400
Oh, come on!

181
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,040
Ma'am,
regarding identification

182
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,760
<i>of the enemy, um, aircraft,</i>

183
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,240
<i>it rather resembles a, um...</i>

184
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Spit it out, man.

185
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,360
<i>It looks like a pirate ship,
ma'am.</i>

186
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
Come again?

187
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
Fire!

188
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Whoa!

189
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,600
Get off.

190
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,130
<i>Don't go dying.</i>

191
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,440
You're precious cargo.

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
- Am I?
- Somebody thinks so.

193
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,680
Is it my mother?

194
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,760
Going up!

195
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Whoa.

196
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,000
Get out here!
You little rat!

197
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Make your move!

198
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,240
<i>Come on, hurry up!</i>

199
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Move it! Come on!

200
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,490
<i>Right this ship
for docking.</i>

201
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,480
<i>Haul away!</i>

202
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,840
Come on, fellas.

203
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,480
Look! It's daylight.

204
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,760
I wanna see this!

205
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,000
- What is that?
- Move, I can't see.

206
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,010
<i>? Hello, hello, hello, how low??</i>

207
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,680
<i>? Hello, hello, hello, how low??</i>

208
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,960
Is this Canada?

209
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,840
<i>? Turn the lights out?</i>

210
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,690
<i>? It's less dangerous?</i>

211
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,800
<i>? Here we are now?</i>

212
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
<i>? Entertain us?</i>

213
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,520
<i>? I feel stupid?</i>

214
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,160
<i>? And contagious?</i>

215
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,800
<i>? Here we are now?</i>

216
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,800
<i>? Entertain us?</i>

217
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,040
<i>? Hey!?</i>

218
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,000
<i>? Hello, hello, hello, how low??</i>

219
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Sing!

220
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,360
<i>? Hello, hello, hello, how low??</i>

221
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,730
<i>? Hello, hello, hello, how low??</i>

222
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
Kneel!

223
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,210
I don't kneel to anyone.

224
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,840
Oh, you'll kneel to him.

225
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,010
<i>He's the pirate
all pirates fear!</i>

226
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,040
<i>The original nightmare!</i>

227
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,560
The man they call Blackbeard!

228
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
<i>? And I forget just why I taste?</i>

229
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>? Oh, yeah, I guess
it makes me smile?</i>

230
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,240
<i>? I found it hard,
so hard to find?</i>

231
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,520
<i>? Oh, well, whatever, never mind?</i>

232
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,360
<i>? Hello, hello, hello, how low??</i>

233
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
<i>? With the lights out?</i>

234
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,280
<i>? It's less dangerous?</i>

235
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,210
<i>? Here we are now?</i>

236
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
<i>? Entertain us?</i>

237
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,640
<i>? I feel stupid and contagious?</i>

238
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,080
Sing for your master!

239
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,210
<i>? Here we are now?</i>

240
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
<i>? Entertain us?</i>

241
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,320
Sweet, gentle children.

242
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,600
You who weep molten pearls
of innocent tears,

243
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,800
dry them, dear nippers.

244
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,560
For I have sprung you
from life's cruel dungeon,

245
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,120
and hereby grant you liberty!

246
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Suffer no more.

247
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,920
Come unto me. You are home.

248
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
Here you join orphans alike

249
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,160
from every corner
of the globe,

250
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,600
every race, creed, and color.

251
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,680
<i>Every age and era.</i>

252
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
<i>You are pioneers.</i>

253
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,840
Brave creators
of a new society.

254
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,120
For this,

255
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,520
my poppets,
is a land of opportunity!

256
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,680
My justice is divine.

257
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,690
My laws are so simple

258
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,360
you could write them
on a pig's ear.

259
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,680
In fact, I have.

260
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,000
Law number one,

261
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,800
<i>"Those who work
with bright, honest vigor"</i>

262
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
<i>"will be rewarded with prizes"</i>

263
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,000
"and trophies"

264
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,210
"and confectionery!"

265
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,000
<i>Law number two,</i>

266
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,800
"Those who fail to work hard,"

267
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,480
"those who skive or malinger,"

268
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,800
"will hereby know the brooding
majesty of my disapproval."

269
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,650
<i>Mark me well.</i>

270
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,160
I know no pity.

271
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,240
No second chances.
I don't do mercy.

272
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,050
But remember,

273
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,680
don't forget
to help yourselves

274
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
to lots and lots
of jolly old fun!

275
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,320
Hey, kiddiewinks,

276
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,520
welcome to Neverland!

277
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,560
<i>Put some effort into it.</i>

278
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,440
<i>You better find me some Pixum!</i>

279
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,730
<i>Harder! Work harder!</i>

280
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
Uh, Sam Smiegel, supervisor.

281
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,720
No, thank you. Take it off.

282
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,080
- Whoa!
- Excuse me.

283
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
What are we digging for?

284
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,200
Did no one explain?

285
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,720
We are mining

286
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,720
for these little chaps.

287
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,400
Fairy dust,
otherwise known as Pixum.

288
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,040
Fairies are real?

289
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,320
Mmm. They were real, yeah.

290
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,480
There were millions of them
all over the island.

291
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,920
What happened to 'em?

292
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Oh, Blackbeard hunted them
into extinction.

293
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,040
- Why?
<i>- For the fairy dust.</i>

294
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
You know, the old Pixum.

295
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,760
What does he want it for?

296
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
I don't have no idea.

297
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,240
No one knows. No one's
allowed to know.

298
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,920
Well, you best not
dwell on it. Just...

299
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,130
<i>Get a move on!</i>

300
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
Real, actual fairies.

301
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
<i>Hey, new kid,</i>

302
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,520
you just got here
on a flying pirate ship.

303
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,330
"Real" should be a very fluid
concept for you right now.

304
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Get to diggin'.

305
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,200
Give me your pick, kid.

306
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,760
Your hand's all messed up
because your blade is blunted.

307
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,410
If you keep
swingin' like that,

308
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
you're gonna break your wrist.

309
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
I'm Peter.

310
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,760
How long have you been here?

311
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,160
Forever.

312
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,320
Do you know why they want it
so badly? The Pixum?

313
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,480
You ask too many questions,
kid.

314
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
They kill for it.
We die for it. End of story.

315
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,440
- Thanks very much.
<i>- Don't thank me.</i>

316
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
I don't care about you.

317
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,130
<i>I'm not your friend,</i>

318
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,200
and I haven't got your back.

319
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,480
Simple as that.

320
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,530
Shoo, kid.

321
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,200
Fairy dust.

322
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,480
I found some.

323
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
That's mine!

324
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
No!

325
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,200
I found some!

326
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,520
Oi, thief! I found it!

327
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,360
Oi, small fry, button it.

328
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Move!

329
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Give it to me.

330
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
It was me!
I found the fairy Pixum!

331
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
This bogey stole it.

332
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
<i>He said he found it.</i>

333
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,240
That means he found it. Clear?

334
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,920
Clear as the scar
on your ugly face!

335
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,960
<i>Take him</i>

336
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,360
to the Captain!
Disorder and verbals.

337
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,720
Move out of the way. Move it.

338
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Get out of the way!

339
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,280
There... There is a procedure
for this, you know.

340
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,520
You're not supposed to...

341
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
- Shut it, Mr. Clipboard.
- Oh!

342
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,560
Let's see
what Blackbeard makes

343
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,040
of this nasty little thief.

344
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,040
Oh, what you lookin' at?
I was tryin' my best.

345
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,400
<i>Well, go on, then.
Back to work. Thank you.</i>

346
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
Did you find
the natives' camp?

347
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,560
They found us, sir.

348
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,090
They sprang from the trees

349
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,600
and laid waste to
40 of our most formidable men.

350
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Then they disappeared

351
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,520
back into the forest
as if they were never there.

352
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,880
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- We will get them, Captain.

353
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,690
Given the proper time.

354
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,760
Time?

355
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,960
Mmm.

356
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
I have sucked these mines dry.

357
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,440
There's almost nothing left.
I must have their lands.

358
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
But these savages

359
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,600
continue to ambush my ships,

360
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,000
operating from
some hidden camp,

361
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
which no one can seem to find.

362
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,440
And yet you assure me all will
be well given the proper time.

363
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,600
There is no time! None!

364
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,880
Oh...

365
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Excuse me, Captain.

366
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,610
Hey ho.

367
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,450
The show must go on.

368
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,080
How do the miners seem?

369
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,120
Dirty, feverish,
on the brink of collapse, sir.

370
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,290
Why must it be so hard?

371
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,440
So...

372
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,840
Who are we making
an example of today?

373
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,000
<i>? Hey ho, let's go!?</i>

374
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,400
<i>? Hey ho, let's go!?</i>

375
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,130
<i>? They're forming
in a straight line?</i>

376
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
<i>? They're going through
a tight wind?</i>

377
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
No, no!

378
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,530
What's going on?

379
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
What do you think?

380
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,440
<i>? They're piling in the backseat?</i>

381
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
<i>? They're generating steam heat?</i>

382
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,200
<i>? Pulsating to the backbeat?</i>

383
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,930
<i>? The Blitzkrieg Bop?</i>

384
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,170
Any clearer now?

385
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,440
<i>? Hey ho, let's go!?</i>

386
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,490
<i>? Hey ho, let's go!?</i>

387
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,360
Yeah!

388
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,680
Brave heroes of Neverland,

389
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,840
behold these traitors.

390
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
<i>I entrust their fate
to your gracious whim.</i>

391
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,000
This barbarian...

392
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,760
caught
stealing from the grain store.

393
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,160
Was caught squealing
from the grain store.

394
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Stealing.

395
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
- Stealing.
- Twice.

396
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Twice!

397
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
- Will you spare him?
<i>- No!</i>

398
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,880
Or do you lust for justice?

399
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
Justice!

400
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
- Yes!
- Justice!

401
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,560
- Do they ever have mercy?
- Oh, yes. They do.

402
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,080
Often?

403
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Uh...

404
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,170
Let's go!

405
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
Don't answer that.

406
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,530
This boy has been
in our mines but one day

407
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,730
and has already proven himself
to be a thief,

408
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,770
<i>a rabble rouser,</i>

409
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
and a Pixum fraudster.

410
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
- I never!
<i>- I ask,</i>

411
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,600
shall you have mercy
for the willful child?

412
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,250
<i>No!</i>

413
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,240
Or do ye be nasty?

414
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,560
<i>Nasty!</i>

415
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,240
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!

416
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
<i>Alack.</i>

417
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
The people have spoken.

418
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,040
Think a happy thought.

419
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,650
I'll be darned.

420
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,400
I don't believe it! I can fly!

421
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>Neverland is a dream.</i>

422
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,280
From which you never wake.

423
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,680
Ever had that one?

424
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,040
A dreadful nightmare
you know is not real,

425
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,480
but your sleep is so heavy,

426
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,120
so deep, so delicious

427
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,280
that you just can't wake up.

428
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,690
<i>Drowning in sleep.</i>

429
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,280
<i>Slow dream</i>

430
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,800
drowning in
the soft, black sea.

431
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,210
Do you know that sea, Peter?

432
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,680
<i>It's death, boy.</i>

433
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,360
Murmuring to you.

434
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,560
It's where we end.

435
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,840
Most of us.

436
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,690
Would you like some chocolate?

437
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,560
Childhood ain't so jolly.

438
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,840
In fact,
it's rather frightening.

439
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,400
Agree?

440
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,200
Are you brave, Peter?

441
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,450
I try to be.

442
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,920
Yes, of course.

443
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,280
Are you scared?

444
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,720
Yes.

445
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Have you ever flown before?

446
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,400
No.

447
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,160
Beyond that wall,
there are savage people.

448
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,890
<i>They have an ancient prophecy</i>

449
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,560
<i>from when the fairy kingdoms
reigned on this island.</i>

450
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,480
The prophecy tells of a boy
born of the love

451
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
between a fairy prince
and a human girl.

452
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,840
<i>A boy who would be
disappeared from this world</i>

453
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
until he was old enough

454
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,680
to return and lead
an uprising against me.

455
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,320
A boy, so says the prophecy,

456
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,000
who could fly.

457
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,000
Have you come to kill me,
Peter?

458
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,520
I don't believe
in bedtime stories.

459
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
<i>"Me... Me."</i>

460
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,800
"Huh... Eh..."

461
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,120
"Er..."

462
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,720
<i>I promise that
you will see me again,</i>

463
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,560
<i>in this world or another.</i>

464
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
"Or another."

465
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,360
Go on! Get in there!

466
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,520
"Or another."

467
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
<i>- Hey, flyboy.</i>
- Yeah?

468
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,560
That was some little airshow
you put on out there.

469
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,410
<i>Could you do that again?</i>

470
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,760
Who wants to know?

471
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,760
Of course I can fly.
You saw me.

472
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,440
Hmm.

473
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
Good.

474
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,080
Put your ear
to that wall over there.

475
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>Now that's the sound
of a blast cap.</i>

476
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
<i>I stuck to the other side.</i>

477
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Set to go off in 30 seconds.

478
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,610
If I fly, you'll help me
find my mother?

479
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I reckon she's here
on the island.

480
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
It's not a negotiation, kid.

481
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,240
Without me,
you're stuck in this cell.

482
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,240
Without me,
you're stuck in these mines.

483
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Okay, then
we'll talk about it.

484
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,360
Just move away from that wall

485
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,160
before you get yourself
blown up, all right?

486
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,640
- So, what's it gonna be?
- Kid!

487
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
Tick

488
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
tock.

489
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,960
Okay, we have a deal, just...

490
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,890
Flyboy?

491
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,120
Hurry! Slide down.
They'll be comin' for us.

492
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,610
If I'm gonna trust you,
I need to know your name.

493
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,160
It's Hook.
The name's James Hook.

494
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,000
- Happy?
- No!

495
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,720
Left foot
in front of the other,

496
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,920
put the right one
in front of the other.

497
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,800
That's it. It's called walking.
Off you go. Go on.

498
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,160
<i>Smee.</i>

499
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,800
Well, go on, then. Carry on.

500
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
<i>- Smee. Down here!</i>
- Whoa.

501
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,960
<i>Six o'clock.</i>

502
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,360
I don't... Yes...

503
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,720
<i>Darn it, Smee,
in the basket.</i>

504
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,000
Please don't call me Smee.

505
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,520
Smee, can you get me
to the surface?

506
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,200
There is no use.

507
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,120
Once you're up there,
you can't get anywhere else.

508
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,200
Not today.

509
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Good knowing ya.

510
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,850
<i>You've been a true friend.</i>

511
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,840
Someday I'll find a way
to repay you.

512
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,720
Now, send us up.

513
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,360
What the heck?

514
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
You just said someday
you'll find a way to repay me.

515
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,560
Someday, not today. Get out!

516
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,400
I think that's
a very minor technicality.

517
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,720
Someday could be today,
if you think about it.

518
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,120
<i>- And, moreover...
- Smee!</i>

519
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,240
<i>Yes.</i>

520
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
<i>That's where
we're headed.</i>

521
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,680
The Skyport.

522
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,080
We can take one of
the cable cars up to the dock.

523
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
<i>Then you'll fly us to a ship.</i>

524
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,920
<i>Okay?</i>

525
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
Huh?

526
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,610
Keep your head down, kid.

527
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
Go! Go!

528
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,640
See? They anchor the galleons
far enough off the dock,

529
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
<i>so they're impossible
to steal.</i>

530
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,640
So you want me to fly from the
dock, over to one of the...

531
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,650
What? Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

532
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,680
Are we meant
to have stopped?

533
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,240
Whoa.

534
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,160
Heave! Heave!

535
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
Forget the Skyport.
You have to do it now.

536
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
<i>Are you waiting
for a formal invitation?</i>

537
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,840
- Go! Now!
- I'm afraid of heights!

538
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,490
What? You can fly!

539
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,120
Yesterday was my first time.

540
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,520
<i>Well, you better fly again,</i>

541
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,320
<i>or we're all gonna fall
for the last time.</i>

542
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,160
Might we bicker
about this later?

543
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,640
Smee! The sword!

544
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,200
Yeah, that's gonna work, kid.

545
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,800
Get up there
and wave it at 'em.

546
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
<i>Heave!</i>

547
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,050
That was close.

548
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,680
Do you know
how to work a ship?

549
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,840
How hard could it be?

550
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
- Smee! The rope!
- Yes! Yes!

551
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,080
- Clear!
- Boy!

552
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,730
<i>Whoa!</i>

553
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,920
This is a lot harder
than it looks!

554
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,920
Yeah! We're sailin' now!

555
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,560
Well, do you have
anything to say?

556
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I worked really hard
setting up that table.

557
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,440
What? Forget the table.
Pick them up later.

558
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,080
If that boy makes it
to the natives,

559
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,650
you can forget any chance
of us winning this war.

560
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
All will be lost.

561
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,520
<i>We'll find them, sir.
They can't have gone far.</i>

562
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,840
Well, then where are they?

563
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
Get me that boy
before the savages do!

564
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,360
Dead ahead!

565
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Ahhh!

566
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,370
<i>Smee! Get off my leg!</i>

567
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,920
<i>I think
I'm gonna be sick!</i>

568
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,600
The wall! The wall!

569
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,370
Somebody, please help me!

570
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,880
Turn!

571
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,330
Smee! Get the sails up!

572
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
We need a strong headwind
to make the jump!

573
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,680
What jump?

574
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,880
Home! We're gettin'
the heck off this island!

575
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,400
No-ho!

576
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,970
You said we'd find my mother!

577
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm not leaving Neverland!

578
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,720
Well, not now, anyway!

579
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,640
Get the sails up!

580
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,120
The sails!

581
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,850
This is gonna be
a little rough!

582
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
Put the sails up!

583
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,720
How many times...

584
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
I am not to be disturbed
when I'm at the Rejuvenator!

585
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,320
Yes?

586
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,200
I am sorry, Captain,
but it's about the boy.

587
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,440
Mmm-hmm?

588
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,760
<i>The stolen ship went down
in the Neverwood.</i>

589
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,040
So the boy is lost?

590
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,080
Yes, sir. He is a lost boy.

591
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,200
<i>But our best men
are searching for him now.</i>

592
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,760
I am surrounded by imbeciles.
Must I do everything myself?

593
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,720
Sir, you can't really believe

594
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,000
that this pipsqueak
is the one.

595
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,530
He hardly seems capable.

596
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,360
His mother
hardly seemed capable either,

597
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,600
and yet, here we are.

598
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,000
The deal was
to help me find my mother.

599
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,120
You were gonna break it.
That's very wrong.

600
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,480
No, you broke the
deal first. You lied to us.

601
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,760
No, I fibbed. I can fly.
Just not every day.

602
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,360
Whoa!

603
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,400
Our only way
off this island

604
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,680
and now it's in pieces.
Satisfied?

605
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,680
Well, yes. I'm quite content.

606
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,480
'Cause I don't wanna
get off this island.

607
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,650
<i>All the years that I've
wasted planning to get out.</i>

608
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,250
<i>All gone.</i>

609
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,880
Hey! Quit messing around.
It's not safe in here.

610
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,800
<i>Every ship has one.</i>

611
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,040
A what?

612
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,840
<i>A map.</i>

613
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,240
<i>What does that say?</i>

614
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,320
"Tribal Territory."

615
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,130
Exactly.

616
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,520
The prophecy said,
"A boy would lead the tribe."

617
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,600
So what?
You don't care.

618
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,040
I do. Keep going.

619
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,210
Well, Blackbeard thinks
the prophecy is about me,

620
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,050
which means
my mum is from here,

621
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,120
which means the natives
might know where she is.

622
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,720
<i>Are you insane?</i>

623
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,080
Those savages would just
as soon kill you as help you.

624
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,480
- Ever met one?
<i>- No!</i>

625
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,720
And I don't plan to.

626
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,570
Well, they might be very nice.
I'm not afraid of 'em.

627
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,000
There's a fine line between
bravery and suicide, kid.

628
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,720
I'm off to go find the
Tribal Territory. Oh, goodbye!

629
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,440
He won't last an hour
out there.

630
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,640
His problem. Not ours.

631
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,920
Thing is,
if he was the chosen one...

632
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,730
If that prophecy is real,
trust me, he ain't it.

633
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,760
But if they thought he was...

634
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,720
They believed he was...

635
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,200
I bet they'd handsomely reward

636
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,600
<i>anyone who brought him
to them.</i>

637
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,080
Well, they haven't got a ship.

638
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,080
<i>Yeah, but they could get one.</i>

639
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,320
Who's fought the pirates
more than the natives?

640
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,880
If anyone could find a way,
it's them.

641
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,400
Just remember,

642
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,800
when we find those
oh-so-sweet-natured locals,

643
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,200
true or not, you tell them
you're their savior.

644
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,840
Then, we'll go
our separate ways. Got it?

645
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,600
Why would you want to leave
a place like this?

646
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,120
Where will you go?

647
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,680
I don't know. Somewhere
I'm a little higher up

648
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,640
on the food chain,
for starters.

649
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
What was that?

650
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,490
Somethin' a little higher up
on the food chain.

651
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,680
Oh.

652
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,920
Oh, that is pretty, Hook.
Do you see that?

653
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,280
<i>We got pirates tryin'
to shoot us down with cannons.</i>

654
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
<i>Nearly falling a thousand feet
to our deaths.</i>

655
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,320
Twice. Shipwrecked.

656
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,720
And you see
something like that

657
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,600
and you think to yourself,

658
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,680
"Oh, worth it."

659
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,960
Are you an orphan?

660
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,600
My ma left me.
That count?

661
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,240
Well,
do you remember her?

662
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,490
I'm not wasting tears missing
someone who never missed me.

663
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,240
Maybe she does.

664
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,120
<i>How can you know?</i>

665
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,170
Do you really believe
your mum's here?

666
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,680
Well, she left me
a note saying...

667
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,320
Oh, well,
if she left you a note, sure.

668
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,880
Just 'cause yours
never loved you...

669
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
<i>Stop.</i>

670
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,200
Doesn't mean
my mum never loved me.

671
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,840
Stop talking right now.

672
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,570
Did you hear that?

673
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,250
It was a deafening
nightmare shriek.

674
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,680
How can anyone
not have heard...

675
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,120
<i>Shh.</i>

676
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,120
That's a Neverbird.

677
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,360
<i>And so is that.</i>

678
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
What're we gonna do?

679
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,040
We need a plan.
We need a plan!

680
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,080
Run!

681
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,560
We'll lose them
in the mist! Go!

682
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,520
Go!

683
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,330
<i>Run, Smee!</i>

684
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,370
Their faces
are terrible,

685
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,760
but their feathers
are quite lovely.

686
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,290
Shut up and run!

687
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,760
Go!

688
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,640
Smee!

689
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,040
Peter!

690
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Hook? Is that you?

691
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,240
Peter.

692
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,200
Hook, they've got Smee.

693
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,680
No.

694
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,320
Don't worry. Everything's

695
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,600
gonna be all right!

696
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,400
I knew we'd find the natives.

697
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,130
<i>We're saved.</i>

698
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,320
Please! I'm ready
to go home now, please.

699
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Let me handle this.

700
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,720
Good fair lady.
We come in peace.

701
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,760
And with treasure.

702
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,920
May I proudly
present to you...

703
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,440
Pan!

704
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,880
Pan!

705
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,240
Pan!

706
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,800
Pan! Pan!

707
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,160
Pan!

708
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,800
Pan! Pan!

709
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,480
Pan!

710
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,120
Smee!

711
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,760
- Smee!
- What?

712
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,080
What are they singing about?

713
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,520
Search me!

714
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,690
Pan! Pan!

715
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
What's going on? What's "Pan"?

716
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,480
The Pan is
our tribe's bravest warrior.

717
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,120
It's our tradition
to grant you the chance to win

718
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,280
your freedom before
we kill you and your friends.

719
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,080
Kill?
What do you mean, "kill"?

720
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,040
You are our sworn enemy.
You're pirates.

721
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,600
Pirates?
We're not pirates. Hold on!

722
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,640
The kid is the one
you've been waiting for.

723
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
Listen!

724
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,010
Your chance to live,

725
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,280
your fiercest fighter
against ours. Our Pan.

726
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,680
<i>You win, you live.</i>

727
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,800
- You lose...
- I get the idea.

728
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,040
Huh?

729
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,360
Bye for now.

730
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,800
Pan!

731
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,160
So how do we know
when to start?

732
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,200
Whoa.

733
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,520
Whoa!

734
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,850
Whoa!

735
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,720
Oh!

736
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,680
- Smee!
- What?

737
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,960
We have to tell them
about my mother.

738
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,080
No one cares
about your darn mother!

739
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,720
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

740
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,480
Ahh!

741
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,760
Okay.

742
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,720
Your Highness.

743
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,760
I was hoping to get you alone.

744
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,760
Stop!

745
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,050
The little one.

746
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,170
He wears the Pan.

747
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,000
He's a boy
that can fly.

748
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,080
I've seen it. It's terrific.

749
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,760
We call this
the Memory Tree.

750
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,040
It was a time of war.

751
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,120
<i>Blackbeard destroyed
everything in pursuit</i>

752
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,440
<i>of the Pixum.</i>

753
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,920
<i>But then,
the chief made a pact</i>

754
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,530
<i>with the great fairy king,</i>

755
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,290
<i>uniting our peoples
against the pirates.</i>

756
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,760
<i>One night, the king's son,
the fairy prince,</i>

757
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,120
<i>found his way
onto Blackbeard's ship.</i>

758
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,040
<i>Her name was Mary,
the love of Blackbeard's life</i>

759
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,120
<i>and his most prized
possession.</i>

760
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,800
<i>Night after night,
the prince visited Mary.</i>

761
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,200
<i>But when Blackbeard
discovered them,</i>

762
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,480
<i>he flew into a jealous rage.</i>

763
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,920
<i>So in order to save her,
the prince took human form.</i>

764
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,120
<i>But though fairies can live
many thousands of years,</i>

765
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,770
<i>in human flesh,
they can live only one day.</i>

766
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,970
<i>The prince sacrificed his life
for the girl he loved.</i>

767
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,240
<i>And the child of that love</i>

768
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,210
was you.

769
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,120
<i>Our people helped your mother
hide you in the other world.</i>

770
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,720
And they made you this totem,

771
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,200
so that when you returned,
we would know it was you.

772
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,800
What happened to my mother?

773
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,690
She returned to the Neverwood
and fought for us many years.

774
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,080
And?

775
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,960
<i>The pirates
were winning the war,</i>

776
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,080
<i>and the fairies had to retreat
to a hidden kingdom.</i>

777
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,690
<i>They've remained there,
in hiding,</i>

778
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,000
<i>unknown by Blackbeard</i>

779
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,000
<i>until a time when they can
reemerge and fight.</i>

780
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
And my mother?

781
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,000
- She's with them.
- She's alive?

782
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,320
Are you sure?
I have to go to her!

783
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,210
- Please, take me now!
<i>- No.</i>

784
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,330
You must be patient.

785
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,760
But she's waiting for me.

786
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,880
The fairy kingdom is the
greatest secret of this land.

787
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,360
Our duty is to protect it.

788
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,280
Before we take you there,

789
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,450
you must prove yourself
to be Mary's son.

790
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,800
<i>The one we've been
waiting for.</i>

791
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,000
When the third moon rises,

792
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,280
he must fly.

793
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,880
If he lives,

794
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,960
he's the one.

795
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,720
One second.

796
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,120
And if he dies?

797
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,720
He's an imposter.

798
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,000
<i>His death Will be justified.</i>

799
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,250
Three days!

800
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,120
I've got the necklace.
Isn't that enough?

801
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,560
You could've stolen it.

802
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,720
But I didn't. Tell her!

803
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,480
Kid's always had that thing.

804
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,280
How long have you known him?

805
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,890
- Three days.
- All my life.

806
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,320
The flying thing
is a stupid detail.

807
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,880
Why can't they just see that?

808
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,560
If you don't believe, Peter,
then neither will they.

809
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,040
But if you do, they will, too.
I promise.

810
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,960
Are you
who they think you are?

811
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,920
- I don't know.
- Hey.

812
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,880
They think
you're their messiah,

813
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,400
that you're here
to liberate them.

814
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,520
Are they right?

815
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,520
I said, I don't know!

816
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,530
Rabbits.

817
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,610
I believe.

818
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,040
I can fly!

819
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,320
If only Nibs was here.

820
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,730
He'd know how to help.

821
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,560
<i>I believe.</i>

822
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,800
Have you seen Smee?

823
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,520
These things
they expect me to do,

824
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,000
I can't do them, Hook.
I've tried.

825
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,200
- Hey. Stop. Hey!
- I can't do the things,

826
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,520
so I can't be the one!

827
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,120
Listen.

828
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,560
Hook,
what the bloody hell am I?

829
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,330
You can go feeling sorry for
yourself all you want, kid.

830
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,930
But knowing where you're from,

831
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,840
that's half of knowing
who you are.

832
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,960
That's more than most of us
here will ever know.

833
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,840
But you said
that your mother left you.

834
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,610
Yeah. I lied.
I do that sometimes.

835
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,130
It's called being a grown-up!

836
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,570
<i>Least you know
where you come from.</i>

837
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,840
Born to a warrior,
heir to a prince.

838
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,200
Does that mean you're the one?
I don't know.

839
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,560
<i>I don't know
if there is a "one."</i>

840
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,930
<i>But I do know</i>

841
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,440
that if you aren't the guy,

842
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,560
and you are just you,

843
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,770
maybe that's enough.

844
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,080
<i>Where's the boy?</i>

845
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,000
Spill the beans,
or I'll spill your blood.

846
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,600
I'll never tell.

847
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,050
He's right over there.

848
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,640
<i>Nope, nope. Wait, my mistake.</i>

849
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,720
Pretty sure it's that way. No!

850
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,880
No. Right the first time.

851
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,600
Definitely, maybe definitely,
this way.

852
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,200
The point is,
we're very close.

853
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,250
Ready the ships.
Bishop, kill him.

854
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,400
No! Just wait!

855
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,760
Wait!

856
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,160
You might not wanna
kill me just yet.

857
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,840
For I hold the crown jewels,
you know.

858
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,000
- Informationally.
<i>- Speak.</i>

859
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,200
Sorry, a bit nervous.
You are quite intimidating.

860
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
Speak!

861
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,440
Now, you know the so-called
extinct fairy kingdom, hmm?

862
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,160
Speak.

863
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,890
Sorry.

864
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,880
I was just lookin' for you.

865
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,400
Well, you found me.

866
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,600
Don't see things
like that in the mines.

867
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,850
Kinda beautiful.

868
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,760
So, do you like sunrises?

869
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,330
What is it you think
you're doing?

870
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,400
Well, I think
it's called flirting,

871
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,680
but if you have to ask,
I might be doin' it wrong.

872
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,040
You're not like the men
from my tribe.

873
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,400
Thank you.

874
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,040
No, they're honest.

875
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,280
Oh.

876
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,240
- Strong. Brave.
- Brave.

877
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,440
That what you call it?

878
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,680
Letting my little buddy
take a leap to his death.

879
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,320
When he ceases
to doubt himself, he will fly.

880
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
How do we know
there are any fairies

881
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
still left on this island

882
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,160
or that they'll come
help fight

883
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,520
just 'cause they see him fly?

884
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,680
You have to trust us.

885
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,040
Why should we?
You certainly don't trust us.

886
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,400
There's a map
to the fairy kingdom.

887
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,840
We guard it with our lives.

888
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,040
Of course there is.

889
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,600
Why wouldn't there be a secret
map to the secret kingdom?

890
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,040
This isn't a game.

891
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,720
You've seen what Blackbeard
has done to Neverland already.

892
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,960
He'll reduce the rest of it
to nothing but mine pits

893
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,490
if we don't stop him.

894
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,680
Has anybody ever told you

895
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,120
you have really
beautiful eyes?

896
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,920
<i>Fire on the foredeck,</i>

897
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,280
<i>prepare to come around.</i>

898
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,400
Tiger Lily!

899
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,920
You missed.

900
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,120
Ha-ha!

901
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,280
We must find Peter!

902
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,280
Shoot her!

903
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,440
- Peter!
- Where's Hook?

904
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,000
All of this because of you.

905
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,480
No, Kwahu, wait!

906
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,840
You're welcome. Now, come on.

907
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,280
Keep moving!

908
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,160
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

909
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,560
The princess, I presume.

910
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,200
<i>Oh, well, actually,
I'm just a miner,</i>

911
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,840
but I appreciate
the compliment.

912
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,280
Bishop.

913
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,880
Go on.

914
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,000
<i>Line them up.</i>

915
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,720
<i>Down here.</i>

916
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,640
All these years
digging our hands raw

917
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,410
for tiny lumps of Pixum,

918
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,840
and now I learn from Mr. Smee

919
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,160
<i>you know where there's
a mountain of the stuff.</i>

920
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,680
Nice as pie.

921
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,610
Tell me where the boy is

922
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,530
<i>and how to find the fairy
kingdom, and you may live.</i>

923
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,160
Death is
the greatest adventure.

924
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,480
Bon voyage.

925
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,040
All hail the new Chiefette.

926
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,400
<i>Princess Tiger Lily.</i>

927
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,600
All hail!

928
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,920
Tell him. He'll kill you.

929
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,640
He's right, you know.

930
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,720
Nice birdie.

931
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,770
- There's a map.
- Traitor.

932
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
<i>Don't shoot her.</i>

933
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,240
She told me there's a map
to the fairy kingdom.

934
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,520
Traitor! How dare
you betray us, pirate?

935
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,040
I'm trying to save
your lives, sweetheart.

936
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,280
It won't happen again.

937
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,090
Oh, it won't, I guarantee it.

938
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,040
Captain.

939
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,920
Go, kid.

940
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,040
Yeah!

941
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,610
Kill them all!

942
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,760
Whoa!

943
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,040
<i>Attack. Attack!</i>

944
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,200
No!

945
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,440
<i>Can I
tell you something, Peter?</i>

946
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,640
You'll never find your mother.

947
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,370
Yes, I will find her.

948
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,320
No, you really, really won't.

949
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,760
You'll never find your mother.
Do you know why?

950
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,440
Because I killed her.

951
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,360
<i>She died at my hand.
By this very blade.</i>

952
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,160
As you will, too.

953
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,800
Close your eyes, Peter,
and think a happy thought.

954
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,560
Bad form, sir!

955
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,120
We have to run, now!

956
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,080
No. We have to jump.

957
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,960
Peter, are you hurt?

958
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,560
Well, I'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

959
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,920
Don't speak to me.

960
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,000
Because of you, everything my
people have fought to protect

961
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,530
- will be destroyed.
<i>- Hey...</i>

962
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,080
Because of you,
the Chief is dead.

963
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,120
- Smee was the rat.
- He was your friend.

964
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,880
- How was I supposed to know?
- You should've known.

965
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,440
- I'm sorry.
- You should've known.

966
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,720
I'm sorry
if I did something wrong!

967
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,160
Where's Peter?

968
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,480
Peter.

969
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,520
<i>You lied.</i>

970
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,680
- You all lied.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

971
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,960
So, it's true?

972
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,450
It's complicated.

973
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,640
Is my mother alive
or isn't she?

974
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,690
Blackbeard spoke the truth.

975
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
And you lied to me.

976
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,840
Had we told you she was dead,

977
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,640
you'd have walked away
from your destiny.

978
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,800
Whoever it is you think I am,

979
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,840
whatever it is
you expect me to be,

980
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,970
I'm not.

981
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,680
And I can't.

982
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,890
I couldn't...

983
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,960
I didn't wanna watch you die.

984
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,160
You should've
closed your eyes.

985
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,040
<i>Blackbeard won't
stop searching for Peter.</i>

986
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,760
<i>There's only one place
on this island</i>

987
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,880
<i>he wouldn't dare look.</i>

988
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,960
Mermaid Lagoon? Sounds pretty.

989
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,360
So pirates are afraid
of mermaids?

990
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,360
Because of what we will pass
through to get there.

991
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,760
Yeah?

992
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,040
Crocodiles.

993
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,170
Afraid?

994
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,840
No, ma'am.

995
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,080
Find the map. Keep looking.

996
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,200
Does Smee please thee?

997
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,640
<i>Pull the place apart!</i>

998
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,160
- So may Smee be free?
- No, you're too useful.

999
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,360
But Smee was promised...

1000
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,280
Smee should cease to talk of
himself in the third person,

1001
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
- or Smee will be a non-person.
- Yes.

1002
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,280
I found it.

1003
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,760
It's a map
to the fairy kingdom.

1004
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,200
Ready the ships!

1005
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,880
We must get there
before Peter.

1006
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,360
Grab the torches.
They're afraid of the light.

1007
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,050
Did we scare 'em off?

1008
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,770
Oh, come on. They can fly?

1009
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,810
Keep waving the torches.

1010
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,520
There!

1011
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,640
Peter!

1012
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,640
Peter!

1013
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,440
I think I see him.

1014
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,970
Where?

1015
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,520
- Reach for my hand!
- Help! Help!

1016
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,680
Peter.

1017
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,160
What happened?

1018
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,720
What the heck are those?

1019
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,160
I don't know, but I think
you're gonna like 'em.

1020
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,680
You could say that again.

1021
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,760
Hey, hey, hey. Don't go.

1022
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,520
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Be careful.

1023
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,570
Who's more careful than me?

1024
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,880
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
what happened to your mother.

1025
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,120
But Blackbeard didn't tell you
the whole truth either.

1026
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,450
Let me show you.

1027
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,800
The mermaids charged
these waters with memories.

1028
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,930
You can see the past.

1029
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,890
Deep breath.

1030
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,120
There's no time.

1031
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,280
Blackbeard's men
nearly have us.

1032
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,360
Go to the fairy kingdom. Hide.
Keep our people safe.

1033
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,400
You should never have
come back, Mary.

1034
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,000
And yet, here you are.

1035
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,320
Ready to die for them
rather than live with me.

1036
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,720
No. Mary.

1037
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,570
No! No.

1038
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,760
No!

1039
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,280
She was a warrior.

1040
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,080
A great warrior. Her sacrifice
still inspires us.

1041
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,840
Did you know her?

1042
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,570
She trained me.

1043
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,570
Would she have been
proud of me?

1044
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,610
Yes.

1045
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,040
Very.

1046
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,960
But what if I can't do
what she did?

1047
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,520
What if I fail
to fulfill the prophecy?

1048
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,760
And what if you fail to try,
Peter?

1049
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,160
What are you then?

1050
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,040
<i>Hey!</i>

1051
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,640
You've gotta see this.

1052
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,960
Now, the hull's
a little banged up.

1053
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,090
And see those teeth marks?
Boy, those crocs can jump.

1054
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,440
But once I get her fixed up,
she's gonna be in good shape.

1055
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,080
For what?

1056
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,080
To get us the hell off this island.

1057
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,600
You're going to run like a coward?

1058
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,240
Well, I never really thought
of it in those exact terms,

1059
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,930
but, generally speaking, yes.

1060
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,480
And where will you go?

1061
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,280
Home. It's, you know,

1062
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,160
where I come from.

1063
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,400
Home's not where you come from.
It's where you make it.

1064
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,800
So help me do that.

1065
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,920
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's attack
is in the mine by now.

1066
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,690
And I've been there,
and I'm not going back.

1067
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,360
Not for anything or anyone.

1068
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,120
Well, if you have
no reason to stay, then go.

1069
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,760
Go now. Leave us to die.

1070
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,960
I don't want you to die.

1071
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,960
I want you to come with me.

1072
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,440
And if I don't?

1073
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,290
Then that's your decision. Not mine.

1074
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,360
<i>Well, kid.</i>

1075
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,960
Looks like the old gang's back together.

1076
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,720
Let's get this ship in the air.

1077
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,480
Let's get one thing straight.

1078
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,410
I'm not the chosen one,

1079
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,040
and the prophecy wasn't about me
if it was ever real at all.

1080
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,160
But I am my mother's son.

1081
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,000
And if Blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for,

1082
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,320
I'll stand against him to the last.
Just like they did.

1083
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,200
Now,

1084
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,400
<i>take me to the fairy kingdom.</i>

1085
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,130
It's just as
the Chief described it.

1086
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,920
These are words.

1087
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,080
- What language is it?
- Must be fairy.

1088
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,960
I can read.

1089
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,720
<i>I can read it.</i>

1090
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,440
What does it say?

1091
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,760
"Only the prince
who bears the key shall pass."

1092
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,920
<i>Just that.</i>

1093
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,840
Then some boring stuff about
the great fallen dead.

1094
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,410
It means we need a key.

1095
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,240
Then this was all for nothing.

1096
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,840
<i>No, I wouldn't say that.</i>

1097
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,840
"The prince who bears the key."

1098
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,760
Don't you see, Peter?

1099
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
- I am the...
<i>- You bear the key.</i>

1100
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,080
I do?

1101
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,200
You've had it all along.

1102
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,640
- She knew I'd come for her.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1103
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,120
Mum tries to protect the kingdom
by giving son the key.

1104
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,810
I kill Mum, but fail to kill the son.

1105
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,800
In turn, son fails to protect the kingdom
by giving me the key.

1106
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,960
<i>Mum would be very disappointed.</i>

1107
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,960
Wouldn't she?

1108
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,840
Eternity beckons.

1109
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,840
I will live forever.

1110
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:03,680
Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine!

1111
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,560
That's where we're going.

1112
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,680
The fairy hive.

1113
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,770
Destroy that, and we destroy them all.

1114
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,200
<i>Yes!</i>

1115
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,530
Yes! Oh! Come!

1116
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,560
Come on. Come.

1117
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,360
Yes.

1118
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,920
<i>Her name's Tinkerbell.</i>

1119
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,890
I can hear her.

1120
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,680
They've been waiting for you, Peter.

1121
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,410
You have to get away from here!

1122
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,970
He's going to destroy you all.

1123
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I know what I was meant to do,
but I failed.

1124
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,090
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1125
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,570
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

1126
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,920
All right, boys, let's burn them!

1127
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,440
Burn them!

1128
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,080
Bum them, burn them, burn them!

1129
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,520
- Burn them all!
- No!

1130
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,280
Please, I'll do anything!

1131
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,120
<i>- Please!</i>
- Oh, don't beg.

1132
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,600
Anything.

1133
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,610
No. It's bad form to beg.

1134
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,120
Where's your sense of honor, boy?

1135
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,960
Now, kneel.

1136
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,000
I said kneel!

1137
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,640
I am the son of a warrior and a prince.

1138
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,400
I will never bow to you.

1139
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,800
If you're gonna kill me,
then get on with it.

1140
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,200
As you wish.

1141
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,680
You don't have to do this.

1142
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,320
No.

1143
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,400
But I really want to.

1144
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,160
Did you miss me?

1145
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,170
Why is it always him?

1146
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Jump!

1147
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,840
You came back!
I thought you didn't care!

1148
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,360
Like I said, sometimes I lie.

1149
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,560
Come on!

1150
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,280
I can't let Blackbeard get to the hive!

1151
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,210
Hard to port!

1152
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,720
Mind if I cut in?

1153
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,320
We've gotta help her!

1154
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,920
Take the wheel!

1155
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,560
You're gonna get this puppy
as close to them as you can.

1156
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,760
- Okay!
- And I'll jump across!

1157
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,290
Hold on!

1158
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,730
<i>Captain!</i>

1159
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,320
No.

1160
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,480
Peter, no!

1161
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,360
No.

1162
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,240
It's over, boy.

1163
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,240
Come.

1164
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,360
You! Grab that girl!

1165
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,960
Pan!

1166
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,480
I can fly!

1167
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,880
Look at me, Hook, I'm flying!

1168
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,920
All right, you don't have to
crow about it.

1169
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,240
Whoa!

1170
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,050
Crow all you want!
Just don't drop me!

1171
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,600
Go on.

1172
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,280
If we're gonna beat him,

1173
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,840
we're gonna do it together.

1174
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,650
Do you hear me?

1175
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,800
Good!

1176
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,600
Now, come on, then.

1177
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,920
<i>Fire!</i>

1178
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,200
Ready?

1179
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,320
Go!

1180
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,240
Got you!

1181
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,240
Think a happy thought.

1182
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,120
No!

1183
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,600
Boy!

1184
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,800
<i>? Hello?</i>

1185
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,440
Peter.

1186
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,440
Peter.

1187
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,840
Mum?

1188
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,280
<i>You found me.</i>

1189
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,000
I have your eyes.

1190
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,720
You have my heart.

1191
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,120
I've imagined this moment
my whole life, and now...

1192
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,170
I love you, Mum. So much.

1193
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,800
I don't know how you can miss
someone you've never met,

1194
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,240
but I've missed you every day.

1195
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,640
Every day?

1196
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,640
Without you, I'm lost again.
What do I do now?

1197
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,480
You're not lost.

1198
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,850
You are home.

1199
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,360
On this island, with these people.

1200
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,160
Your people.

1201
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,880
Your family.

1202
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,320
You must never give up on them,

1203
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,170
as you never gave up on me.

1204
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,040
But, Mum,

1205
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,000
I don't want to lose you again.

1206
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,010
<i>You'll never lose me.</i>

1207
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,440
<i>I'll always be part of this Neverland.</i>

1208
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,850
And a part of you.

1209
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,600
I love you, my son.

1210
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,720
My Peter.

1211
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,200
My Peter Pan.

1212
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,610
Peter.

1213
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,800
Peter?

1214
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,130
You thought I'd leave you here.

1215
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,360
- No, I never.
- Feel like some fun?

1216
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,920
Yes, please.

1217
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,480
All right, gentlemen.

1218
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,290
- Hold on tight.
<i>- Peter!</i>

1219
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,840
You don't have a rope.

1220
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,360
We have a lot to talk about.

1221
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,720
I thought you were leaving.

1222
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,040
Change of heart.

1223
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,160
Will you take the wheel, please?

1224
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,400
You don't want to go home?

1225
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,440
I already am.

1226
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,880
<i>Is he a pirate, too?</i>

1227
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,520
No.

1228
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,360
Not yet, anyway.

1229
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,280
Which way shall we go?

1230
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,760
- Set a course!
- Set a course!

1231
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,080
Hey, who's in charge here?

1232
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,400
Well, I'm the captain.

1233
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,600
And I'm the chosen one.

1234
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,240
We'll have plenty of time
to argue about that later, flyboy.

1235
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,480
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.

1236
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,600
Set a course.

1237
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,400
Second to the right
and straight on till morning.

1238
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,250
Neverland!

1239
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,560
Neverland!

1240
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,920
<i>We'll always be friends, Hook.
Won't we?</i>

1241
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,680
<i>Always.
What could possibly go wrong?</i>

1242
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:13,280
