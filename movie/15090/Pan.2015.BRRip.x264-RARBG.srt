Close your eyes, Peter,

Bad form, sir!

Well, I'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

Because of you,

-He was your friend.

-You should've known.

-You should've known.

-I'm sorry.

1163
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,967
So, it's true?

1164

It's complicated.

Is my mother alive
or isn't she?

1166

Blackbeard spoke the truth.

1167
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,441
And you lied to me.

1168

Had we told you she was dead,

1169

Smee should cease to talk of

Would she have been

Yes.

But what if I can't do

01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,522
What if I fail
to fulfill the prophecy?

And what if you fail to try,

You've gotta see this.

Now, the hull's

Boy, those crocs can jump.

she's gonna be in good shape.

For what?

1253
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,084
To get us the hell off this island.

You're going to run like a coward?

Well, I never really thought
of it in those exact terms,

01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,930
but, generally speaking, yes.

1257
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,481
And where will you go?

1258
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,288
Home. It's, you know,

1259
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,162
where I come from.

1260
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,242
Home's not where you come from.
It's where you make it.

1261
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,806
So help me do that.

1262
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,924
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's attack
is in the mine by now.

And I've been there,

Not for anything or anyone.

Well, if you have
no reason to stay, then go.

Go now. Leave us to die.

1267
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,969
I don't want you to die.

1268
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,966
I want you to come with me.

1269
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,446
And if I don't?

1270
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,290
Then that's your decision. Not mine.

1271

<i>Well, kid.</i>

1272
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,961
Looks like the old gang's back together.

01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,723
Let's get this ship in the air.

1274
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,484
Let's get one thing straight.

1275
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,410
I'm not the chosen one,

1276
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,042
and the prophecy wasn't about me
if it was ever real at all.

1277
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,163
But I am my mother's son.

1278
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,001
And if Blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for,

1279
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,325
I'll stand against him to the last.
Just like they did.

1280
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,207
Now,

1281

TIGER LILY: It's just as

1283
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,927
These are words.

1284
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,087
- What language is it?
-TIGER LILY: Must be fairy.

1285
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,961
I can read.

1286
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,721
<i>I can read it.</i>

1287
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,446
What does it say?

1288
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,764
"Only the prince
who bears the key shall pass."

1289
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,921
<i>Just that.</i>

1290
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,842
Then some boring stuff about
the great fallen dead.

1291
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,410
It means we need a key.

1292
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,240
Then this was all for nothing.

1293
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,765
<i>BLACKBEARD". No, I wouldn't say that.</i>

1294
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,848
"The prince who bears the key."

1295
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,761
Don't you see, Peter?

1296
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
- I am the...
- BLACKBEARD: You bear the <i>key.</i>

1297
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,081
I do?

1298
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,205
You've had it all along.

1299
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,642
- She knew I'd come for her.
-BLACKBEARD: Yes.

Well, I'm the captain.

1467
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,607
And I'm the chosen one.

1468
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,121
We'll have plenty of time
to argue about that later, flyboy.

1469
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,482
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.

1470
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,607
Set a course.

1471
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,404
Second to the right
and straight on till morning.

1472
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,889
(ALL CHEERING)

1473
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,250
BOY: Neverland!

1474
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,562
Neverland!

1475
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,922
<i>PETER: We'll always be friends, Hook.
Won't we?</i>

1476
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,686
HOOK: <i>Always.
What could possibly go wrong?</i>
