and the third was beaten to death by his own service robot.

146
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,310
他们的大脑都被入侵过
All showed signs of cerebral hacking.

147
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,100
跟奥斯蒙一样的手法
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

148
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,620
他们都是阪华机械的高层

149
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,300
就像奥斯蒙博士

每个犯罪现场 都留下一条讯息
A message was left at each of the crime scene...

151

By someone identifying himself...

152
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,640
九世
as Kuze.

153
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,070
谁跟阪华机械同流合污 谁就得死

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
我叫你先不要行动
I told you not jump off.

162
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,870
我不能等 不然会死更多人
I had to, or more would have died.

163
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,560
你是我们团队的一员 就必须服从命令
You are a member of my team, and my responsibility

164
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,490
我会找到他 并杀了他
I'll find him... and I will kill him.

165
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,330
这是我的任务对不对 课长
It's what I am built for, isn't it?

166
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,180
你不仅仅是一个杀人机器
You are more than just a weapon.

167
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,060
你有灵魂 能思考
You have a soul, a ghost.

168
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,240
这是我们独有的美德
When we see our uniqueness as a virtue...

169
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,330
只有人性 才能为我们带来和平
Only then will we find peace.

For someone who doesn't like people How come you care about dogs so much

182
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,820
我喜欢流浪狗 它们也喜欢我
I dont know. I like just strays and they like me.

183
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,880
那是因为你喂它们
They like you Because you feed them.

184
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,180
说这种话

真的吗
Sure is that?

191
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,310
我还以为你更喜欢猫呢
...more of a cat person.

192
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,980
你从来不提起你的过去
You don't talk about that stuff.

193
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
什么
What?

194
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,230
- 你的过去  - 我记得不多
- Your past.  - I don't remember much.

195
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,200
只有一些零星的记忆
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

196
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,570
你的家人呢
What about family?

197
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,210
我的父母带我到这个国家 他们就死了
My parents, they died bringing us to this country.

198
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,960
我们的船被击沉在港口
Our boat sank in the harbor.

199
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,200
我差点淹死
I almost drowned.

200
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,380
我总是觉得
I feel sinking...

201
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,870
有一层浓雾 遮住了我的记忆
there is always this thick fog over my memory.

202
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,370
始终看不清楚
And I can't seen through it.

203
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,770
你很幸运
You are lucky.

204
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,690
我每天每夜都被记忆折磨着
Every single day I get screwed upon my memory.

205
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,380
不记得更好
It's better to be pure.

206
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,300
就像你一样
Like you.

212
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,470
你是首屈一指的 但你不是毫无破绽
Your have damaged internal systems.

213
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,110
或许下次你可以把我设计的更好
Maybe next time you can design me better.

214
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,090
- 你好吗  - 我没事 不觉得疼痛
- How are you?  - I am fine. I can't feel anything.

215
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,030
不是的 我是指精神方面
No you, in There.

216
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
经常出现幻觉
I have been having glitches...

217
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,810
没多久就消失了
but it will pass.

218
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,840
- 你有按时吃药吗  - 是的
- Have you been taking your medication?  - Yeah.

219
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,430
但是没有用 今天早上又发生二次
But these wounds are so cycling. I had two this morning.

220
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,120
- 声音还是画面  - 都有
- Sound or image?  - Both.

221
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,450
找到了
I see it.

222
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,570
发现未加密的文件 是你下载的吗
You made any unencrypted downloads?

223
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,110
- 不是 请你帮我删除  - 确认删除
- No. Just delete them from me.  - Consent?

224
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,240
我是蜜拉少校 我同意删除这些数据
My name is Major Mary Killian. I give my consent to delete this data.

225
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,810
好了
It's done.

226
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,760
- 让我看看你的脖子  - 那是什么
- No big deal.  - What are they?

227
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,220
是记忆的感官回波 还是幻觉
Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.

228
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,570
我还不能确定
I'm not sure.

229
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,600
要怎么分辨幻觉跟记忆
How do you know it's a glitch of what's me?

230
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,620
幻觉和你真正的记忆
The glitches have a different texture...

231
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,890
有不同的特征
to the rest of your code.

232
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,700
我什么都看得见
I can see everything.

233
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,390
你的思想 你的决定
All of your thoughts, your... decisions.

234
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,710
看来只有人类才能保有隐私
I guess privacy is just for humans.

235
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,630
你就是人类
You are human.

236
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,760
大家都把你当做人类
People see you as human.

237
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,300
我身边的每个人
Everyone around me seems to fit.

238
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,110
他们好像都有牵挂的事物
They seem connected to something. Something I...

239
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,850
可是我没有
am not...

240
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,440
- 就像我没有过去  - 你当然有过去
- Like I have no past.  - Of course you have a past.

241
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,140
你将会感受和人的羁绊 并关心他们
And at time you'll feel more more connected to it and to them.

242
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,770
手放开再握紧
Opens and close, please.

243
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,920
我们执着于记忆 好像它定义了我们
We cling to memories as if they define us, but...

244
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,780
并非如此
They really don't.

245
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,560
定义我们的是我们的行为
What we do is what defines us.

I'm busy.

249
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,370
达林博士 有结果了吗
Dr... Dahlin! Are you finished yet?

250
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,790
如果她没被打的那么惨
If you hadn't rained all the Geisha with the bullets,

251
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,900
那就容易多了
This would be much easier.

252
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,510
- 不是我打的  - 是我
- I didn't shoot him.  - I did.

253
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,740
还要好几天
This is gonna take days.

254
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,550
几百种模拟运算等着我做呢
I need to run hundreds of potential simulations.

255
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,400
我们没有时间了
We don't have the time.

256
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,290
她本来是一个伴侣机器人
She was a Hanka companion bot.

257
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,860
但被入侵 重新修改程式
But she was reprogrammed for cerebral hacking.

258
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,660
硬碟检查过了吗
What was on her drives?

259
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,660
没有东西 数据在入侵完就被删除了
Nothing. The data was destroyed as it was transmitted.

260
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,730
查不出他想偷什么
No sign of what she was up to.

261
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,280
硬件遭到破坏
The hardware was vandalized.

262
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,650
破坏的很彻底
They ripped her up.

263
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,940
那我得深潜找到被删除的档案
Then I have to do a deep dive.

264
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,920
深潜时你无法加密保护自已
You can't encrypt you in the deep dive

265
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,560
我知道
I know it.

266
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,440
对方可能有陷阱 比如电磁波 病毒
They could left traps in her. Mag pulses, viruses.

267
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,880
她说得对
She is right.

268
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,690
你的大脑暴露在敌人眼前 门户大开
You will be exposing your mind to who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

269
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,210
我必须要这样做 才能尽快找到九世
I have to get inside her memory. It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

270
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,610
这样太危险了
It's too dangerous.

271
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,300
而且是不负责任的做法
And highly irresponsible.

272
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,600
你确定
Are you sure?

273
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,620
有人恶意攻击就把我拉出来
You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.

274
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,010
你怎么比我还紧张
How come you're the one sweating?

275
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,250
开始
Run it.

276
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,600
内部网路与少校连线 并予以解密
Cyber mind connection to the Major, now active...

281
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,370
切断连线 把她拉出来
Disconnect. Get her out.

282
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,060
- 把她拉出来  - 我正在拉 她的大脑被入侵了
- Get her out!  - I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

283
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,940
快啊
Get her out now!

284
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,030
好了
Now!

285
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,570
你怎么样了
Are you okay?

286
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,700
我知道他在哪里了
I know where he is.

287
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,840
我知道那里 那是四眼帮的地盘
I know where he is. That's the four eye area

288
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,240
- 你在外面  - 好
- You're outside  - yes

289
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,140
我先进去看看 到时候再呼叫你们
I am advanced to see and call you again.

290
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,540
你们等我的消息
You wait for my news

291
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,340
每次都这样
Every time this way

292
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,300
我也是很厉害的 都没有表演的机会
I'm very strong, and there's no chance to perform.

293
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,890
门口两名守卫 有武装强化
Two mercs at the door. Armed and enhanced.

294
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,710
收到 交给我们处理
Copy that. We got it covered.

295
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,340
这家夜店藏有很多枪械武器
There's a lot of heat in here for a nightclub.

296
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,810
它是黑帮的堂口 你很意外吗
It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?

297
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,610
我还蛮喜欢这里的
I quite like the place.

298
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,890
我怎么不觉得奇怪
Why doesn't that surprise me?

299
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,760
我去吸引他们的注意 看能不能到地下室去
I am gonna have to draw some attention. See if I can access the basement that way.

300
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,850
你不是来找麻烦的吧
You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?

301
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,940
我是来找姑娘的 顺便喝一杯
I am just here for the girls... and beer.

302
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,820
- 有事吗  - 我是来找人的
- Can I help you?  - I am looking for someone.

303
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,360
你以前来过吗
You've been here before?

304
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,980
我朋友在这里做过强化 专业的
My friend had some mech work done here.

305
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,890
我们这儿不做强化
We don't do mech work here.

306
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,950
不好意思
My mistake.

307
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,890
不如跟我们玩玩 找个人快乐一下
Why don't you come have fun with us? We will have some privacy.

308
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
我进来了
I'm in.

309
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,300
有需要通知我一声
I'll be here when you need me.

310
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,980
- 你朋友在这儿做过什么  - 我朋友在这儿做过强化
- You say your friend worked here?  - I said my friend had work done here.

311
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,450
你朋友
She's human?

312
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,470
他是人类
Your friend.

313
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
你这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

314
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,350
巴特
Batou.

315
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
你听到了吗
Can you hear me?

316
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,840
谁给你做了这身强化
Who did this stunning work on you?

317
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
真是完美
It is divine.

318

巴特 讯号都断了
Batou, I'm losing signal.

321
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,350
别紧张 亲爱的
Don't worry sweety.

322
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,830
没有人会来打扰我们
We have privacy.

323
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
听着
Listen.

324
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,400
这里收不到讯号
You know the signal is green in or out.

325
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,030
少校 我准备好了 你在哪里
Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?

326
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240

327
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,450
到底怎么了 别让我担心
If you don't answer, you're gonna hurt my feelings.

328
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,640
拉卓雅 能联系上少校吗
Ladriya, do you have major on Comms?

329
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,440
没办法 讯号被切断了
Got nothing. The signal is still blocked.

330
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,670
我这个人没什么耐心 所以
I am afraid I get bored by that easily, so...

331
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,940
如果你不想说话
You don't wanna talk...

332
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,900
那就来跳舞吧
Maybe you wanna dance!

333
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,340
该死的 少校 你在哪里
Major, come on. Answer me.

334
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,250
我说过不找麻烦的
I thought you said no trouble.

335
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,350
跳啊
Dance!

336
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,640
等一下
Wait a minute

337
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,200
老实说
The truth is...

338
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,490
我不是跳舞机器人
I wasn't built to dance.

339
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,420
有讯号了 我去楼下的房间看看
Back on comms. I am heading to the back room.

340
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,390
想死你了 我马上过去找你
I missed you. I'll meet you there.

341
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,090
谁跟阪华机械同流合污 谁就得死
Collaborate with Hanka Robotics should be destroyed.

342
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,890
少校
Major?

343
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,240

My eyes

344

Where is Batou?

345
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,210
在隔壁房间义体强化 他没事
In enhancement, next door. He is doing well

346
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,270
你承受了大部分冲击
you took most of the blast.

347
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,150
我只能眼睁睁的看着他
I saw him down there.

348
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,320
就好像
It was like...

349
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,880
他在等着我
He waited to see me.

350
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,520
我们给你做脑部扫描
We synaptic scanned you.

351
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,160
把你看到的东西送到中央实验室九区做分析
Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.

352
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,730
你知道 扫描的时候
You know, the scan...

353
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,320
出现了很多你的幻觉
Also turned up the number of glitches.

354
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,050
幻觉更多了
They've been getting worse.

355
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,180
什么时候开始
Since when?

356
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,770
自从我深潜以后
Since the deep dive.

357
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,030
那些幻觉会让你想起什么吗
Do any of the glitches mean something to you?

358
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,550
不
No.

359
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
想不起来
They don't.

360
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,740
你被拉进那个人用的液体里面
You have been inside the same shell as he has.

361
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,270
这可能会产生非常严重的后果
That could have very serious consequences.

362
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,430
你未经授权就深潜到艺妓体内
You were not authorized to deep dive the geisha.

363
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,290
我让你失望了
You're disappointed.

364
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,520
不 我是担心你
No, I'm worried.

365
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,850
你并非无懈可击
You're not invulnerable.

I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.

为什么
Why not?

368
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,250
你可以看到我的想法
You can see all my thoughts so...

369
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,700
也应该可以保护它
You should be able to secure them.

372

你不知道这让我多孤单
You don't know how alone that makes me feel.

373
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,350
我能看到你 知道吗
I can see you out there, you know.

374
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,040
你看到几根手指头

别担心 你会习惯的
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?

392
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,450
还是公安九课需要更多的资源
Is section 9 missing some critical operational resource?

我们的需求都已经得到满足

396
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,720
你让她深潜到损坏的艺妓里面找线索
That you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

我看着她 心里想着

439
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,770
我要付你赡养费 和买小提琴的钱
"You want me to for pay for violin too".

443
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,450
可是听她拉小提琴真是受罪啊
But when she prox that thing, it's painful right?

444
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,530
难道不能学钢琴吗
Why not piano?

445
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:23,330
反正学费都一样 就算弹得不怎么样
I mean, it's the same price, and doesn't sound so bad.

是栋公寓大楼
It's a tall place, right?

472

真的不是我做的

482
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,510
你们为什么一直问我同样的问题

我不明白他怎么都不记得了
I don't understand. How can he not know?

484
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,420
大脑入侵需要创造真空 九世先删除他一段记忆
The hack must have created a vacuum. Kuze's wiped his memory...

485
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,350
才有真空写入假的记忆
and somehow installed a new reality.

486
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,140
至少他相信他有孩子
At least he got to believe he had a kid.

487
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,910
有什么区别呢
What's the difference huh?

488
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,410

00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,590
梦想 回忆
Dreams, memories?

490
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,220
其实都一样
It's all the same.

491
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,580
毫无意义
Just noise.

492
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,940
是他
It's him.

493
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,660
他来了
He is in there.

494
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,380
那里是封闭区域 他是怎么办到的 少校
This cube is secure. He can't be, Major.

495
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,660
测谎仪
Lie Detector.

496
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,410
一定是从那里入侵的
He must have hacked in that way.

497
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,420
赶快上传仪器的代码 追踪他的位置
We should uplink to the machine, trace the code, get a lock on his location.

498
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,100
快去
Do it.

499
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,580
别进去 太危险了
Don't go in there. It's too dangerous.

00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,360
少校
Major

501
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,870
我们不知道他的能耐
We don't know what else he can do.

502
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,710
讯号不稳定 你能找到他吗
The signal is unstable. Can you get the lock on him?

503
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,670
我尽力 那开始吧
We gotta move fast. We're losing him.

504
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,720
连线中
Connecting.

505
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,940

过来
Come here.

507
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,960
我很害羞
I'm shy.

508
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,020
我不像你这样
I'm not beautiful...

509
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:06,840
漂亮

510
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,530
告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you are.

511
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,860
我重生过不只一次了
I have been born more than once.

512
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,440
所以名字也不只一个
So I have more than one name

513
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,990
我会找到你
I'll find you.

514
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,000
我等着
Not yet.

515
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,530

I am not done.

516
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,570
正在追踪他的位置
The machine is tracing his location.

517
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:28,550
找到他了
We got a fix!

518
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,450
我没说谎
I need to see her.

519
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,800
请救救我
No Please. I know...what...

520
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:38,990
找到他了
We got him.

521
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,500
走吧
Let's go.

522
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,520
拿起武器
Weapons up.

523
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,740
- 走  - 上啊
- Go.  - On me.

524
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,650
趴下 趴下
Stay Down! Stay Down!

525
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,350
放下 放下
Put it down, put it down.

526
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:18,970
有炸弹
Grenade!

527
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:16,860
少校
Major!

528
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,670
回答我
Come in.

529
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,930
我知道为什么找不到他了
I knew why we could not find him.

530
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,010
他透过人脑布建自已的网路
He is using human minds to create a network of his own.

531
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,650
我们马上过去
We're coming to your position.

532
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,720
告诉我 你是谁
Tell me who you are.

533
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,590
我就是你要摧毁的目标
I'm that what you seek to destroy.

534
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,870
此生我的名字叫
In this life, my name is...

535
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,980
九世
Kuze.

536
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,640
你对我做了什么
What are you doing to me?

537
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:14,500
我把你连接到我自创的网络上
I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.

538
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,180
当我死了以后
When I am finished in this world...

539
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:21,850
我的灵魂可以继续存在 然后重生
my ghost can survive there and regenerate.

540
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,470
你想对我怎么样
What do you want from me?

541
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,110
当你深潜到
I became...

542
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,390
艺妓机器人里面找我的时候
Fascinated with you...

543
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,670
我解读了你的代码
Reading your code...

544
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,570
然后就对你有了兴趣
when you were inside that geisha.

545
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:42,750
你给了我前所未有 但又似曾相识
Like nothing I had felt before, yet so...

546
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,940
熟悉的感觉
Familiar.

547
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,320
我们是一样的
We are the same.

548
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,440
我们不一样
We are not the same.

549
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,080
你滥杀无辜
You kill innocent people.

550
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,200
无辜 你说他们无辜
Innocent? Is that the...what you call them?

551
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,350
他们把我害成这样
I am as they need me.

552
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,910
是谁害你的
Who made you?

553
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,120
他们是怎么跟你说的
What have they told you?

554
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,750
说你是第一个
That you were the first?

555
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,680
第一个有灵魂的人脑机器人
The first cerebral salvage.

556
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:17,300
我们的失败 让他们吸取了教训
You were born of lessons...

557
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,190
造就了你
from my failure.

558
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,340
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

559
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,390
他们支解我的身体 像垃圾般丢掉
I was conscious while they dismembered my body,

560
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,240
当时我还有意识
and discarded me like garbage.

561
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,170
我躺在手术台上
I was lying on a table...

562
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:42,500
医生说我的大脑 跟他们制造的液体不相容
Listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not matched with the shell that they had built.

563
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:47,070
我就是代号二五七一研究计划
I'm projected to 2571...

564
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,860
失败的案例
had failed...

565
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,540
然而他们还不死心
and they had to move on...

566
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,030
直到制造了你
to you.

567
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,650
你真完美
Morning beauty you are.

568
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,220
看来经过了我们的失败
They have improved us so much...

569
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,350
让他们颇有收获
since they made me.

570
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,670
他们认为我们是人类进化的缩影
They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.

571
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,350
但我们这两件作品
But they have created us...

572
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,050
却超越了他们
to evolve alone...

573
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,310
我进化了
beyond them.

574
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,290
进化 这就是你的想法
Evolution? That's what you call?

575
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,040
杀光所有害你变成这样的人
Killing everyone who made you?

576
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,750
你根本就没听懂
You are not listening to me.

577
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,850
你是杀人凶手
You are murderer.

578
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,150
是他们先要杀我的
They tried to kill me first.

579
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,910
我是自我防卫
It is self-defense.

580
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,090
保护我自已
The defense of self.

581
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,500
还会死更多人
More will die...

582
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,550
直到我查清楚
until they tell me...

583
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,560
他们对我做了什么
what they took.

584
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,150
我绝不允许
I won't let that happen.

585
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,030
你想杀了我吗
You want to kill me?

586
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,500
像其他人一样
Like everyone else.

587
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,490
那就来吧
Do it, then.

588
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,950
这就是你存在的意义吗
Do what you are programmed to do.

589
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,130
那是什么
What is that?

590
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,840
那是什么
What is that?

591
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:03,330
我不记得了 它本来就在那里
I kick in to remember, but I am haunted by it.

592
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,130
你也是吗
Do You see it?

593
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,710
德古沙
Togusa!

594
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:21,910
不要吃他们拿给你的药物
Don't take the medication that they gave you...

595
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,300
那个药物会抑制你的记忆
They use it to suppress your memories.

596
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:29,600
你的躯壳属于他们 但灵魂不是
Your shell belongs to them, but not your ghost.

597
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,050
你的灵魂属于你自已
Your ghost is yours.

598
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,100
记住我的话
Remember that...

599
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,290
或许你会想起所有的事情
and maybe you can remember it all.

600
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,050
离她远一点 把枪放下
Get away from her! Get down on the ground now.

601
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,320
少校
Major...

602
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,080
少校
Major!

603
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,340
哦 蜜拉
Oh Mela

604
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,340
我的天啊 你没事
My God, you're all right

605
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,440
我们都很担心你
We're all worried about you

606
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,990
你跑去哪里了
Where are you going

607
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,640
别这样
Don't do like that

608
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,040
拜托
Please.

609
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,280
你们究竟对我做了什么
What did you do to me

610
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,840
不管九世跟你说了什么 或是你看到了什么
No matter what you say to nine or what you see

611
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,840
我从来都不曾想要伤害你
I never wanted to hurt you

612
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:08,780
多少个人
How many?

613
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,610
很多
Dozens

614
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,680
多少
How many?

615
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,000
在你之前 我们失败了九十八次
98 unsuccessful attempts before you.

616
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,580
你杀了九十八个无辜的人
You killed 98 innocent people.

617
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,230
不 我没杀过任何人
No, I didn't kill anyone.

618
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,540
没有那些失败
You wouldn't be here.

619
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,690
没有那些实验 你现在也不会站在这里
You would not exist if it weren't for those experiments.

620
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,500
那些实验
Experiments?

621
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,590
- 我是你的实验品  - 不
- Is that what I am to you?  - No!

622
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,270
不 蜜拉
No, Mira!

623
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,630
牺牲是必须的
Sacrifices were made.

624
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,110
实验体是从哪里来的
Where did the bodies come from?

625
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,200
我是从哪里来的
Where did I come from?

626
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,900
你是卡特先生找来的
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

627
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,160
我没有问过他
I did not ask questions.

628
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,750
港口呢
The harbor.

629
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:16,070
我的父母
My parents.

630
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,420
他们的死因
The way they died.

631
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,810
是真的吗
Did that happen?

632
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
不
No.

633
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,680
那是我们给你创造的假记忆
We gave you false memories.

634
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,700
当卡特先生要把你指派到公安九课
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

635
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,550
打击恐怖分子 我没同意
To fight terrorists. I didn't approve.

636
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:41,300
这太残忍了 可是我的工作很重要
It was cruel, but my work, that was important, and...

637
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,560
所以你诞生了
you were born.

638
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,830
你是这么的完美
You were so beautiful.

639
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,110
我的一切都是假的
Nothing I have is real.

640
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,600
我找到他了
I found him.

641
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,980
我说过你要当心
I told you to be careful.

642
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,960
你知不知道他是谁
You knew who he was the whole time.

643
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,430
你制造了他
You built him.

644
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,270
他是一个
He had a...

645
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,260
极端暴力又不稳定
Violent unstable mind.

646
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,490
他的大脑和液体连接并不相容
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

647
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,060
- 我试过救他  - 不
- I tried to save him!  - No.

648
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,560
你让他自生自灭
You left him to die.

649
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,210
没有九世的踪迹 我去搜查上城区
Nothing on Kuze yet, sir. Checking upper zones next.

650
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,430
少校有消息吗
Is there any word on Major?

651
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:39,030
她不在网路上 断线了
She's gone. Off-grid. Silent.

652
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,070
收到 课长
Copy that, sir.

653
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,400
我知道她去哪里
I know where to find her.

654
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,160
我没叫你过来
I didn't ask you to come here.

655
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,820
你是没叫我
You never ask.

656
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,130
可是我每次都来
But I always do.

657
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,450
他们派你来找我吗
Did they send you to bring me in?

658
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,910
我是来钓鱼的 有看到鱼吗
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

659
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,720
你一向服从命令 如果他们派你来杀我呢
You are a company man, you follow orders. So, if they ordered you to kill me.

660
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,840
别跟我胡说八道 我会生气的
Stop saying shit like that. You're gonna piss me off.

661
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,290
水下怎么样
What's it like down there?

662
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:21,790
又冷又黑
It's Cold and dark.

663
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,150
好像是另一个世界
Just a million miles away.

664
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:27,960
没有声音
No voices.

665
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,480
没有数据流
No data streaming.

666
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:32,850
什么
Just...

667
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,400
都没有
nothing.

668
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,860
- 很可怕  - 那你为什么下水
- It scares me.  - Then Why do you do it?

669
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,290
它感觉很真实
It feels real.

670
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,160
为什么不拦住九世
Why didn't you stop him?

671
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,520
我不知道还能信任谁
I don't know who to trust anymore.

672
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,230
你信我 不是吗
You trust me, right?

673
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,170
我信你
Yes I do.

674
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,150
我只是不喜欢那样
I just don't like it.

675
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,490
我要你带我回去
I need you to take me back.

676
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,610
还有很多事要查清楚
There is more I need to find out.

677
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,370
好吧
Sure.

678
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,890
欧莱特博士
Dr. Ouelet...

679
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,280
你给她说了什么
What have you told her?

680
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:59,210
她知道了
She knows.

681
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,910
我派人去抓她
I'm bringing her in.

682
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,520
保安队呼叫总部
Hanka security to Headquarters.

683
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,380
发现少校
We have the Major.

684
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,160
为什么给她打镇静剂
Why is she sedated?

685
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,140
她被恐怖分子策反了
She's been turned by a terrorist.

686
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,840
但你已经知道了
But you know that already.

687
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,160
她去找你的时候 你就应该通知我的
You should have called the first time she came to see you.

688
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:30,160
而你却告诉她所有的事情
Instead, you gave her information.

689
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,540
你凭什么觉得你有权利…
What makes you think you have the...

690
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,310
- 她的作为宣告了  - 二五七一研究计划的失败
- Right to tell me that?  - 2-5-7-1 took us close.

691
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,930
而现在是进入下一阶段的时候
It's time to move on to the next iteration.

692
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,470
二五七一研究计划没有失败
2-5-7-1 is not a failure.

693
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,660
我会删除她的记忆 并重新编码
I will delete all the data and reprogram her.

694
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:43,870
- 她不会记得这些事的  - 不…
- She won't remember him at all.  - No, no, no, no.

695
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,280
你把恐怖分子的数据下载后
You download all the data on the terrorist...

696
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,600
就要终止她的程式 将她关机
and then I order you to terminate.

697
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,250
- 什么  - 你会做出更好的
- What?  - We'll build one that's better.

698
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:00,150
- 我会删除她的记忆  - 没有用的
- I'll delete everything.  - You deleted before.

699
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,650
- 她是我的  - 不
- She's mine.  - No.

700
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,160
你和我有合约协议
She is a contract... with me.

701
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,060
我们成功了
We succeeded.

702
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,780
她胜过人类 也胜过机器人
She is more than human... and more than AI.

703
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:18,180
我们改变了她的躯体 但她的灵魂还在
We change her entire identity. But her ghost survived!

704
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,640
这就是导致我们失败的原因
Her ghost is what failed us.

705
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,700
我们控制不了她 所以她已经没有价值了
We can not control her. She is no longer a viable asset.

706
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,550
这将是你对她做的最后一件事
You should be the one to do it.

707
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,130
你要对我做什么
What are you doing to me?

708
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,280
给你进行脑波扫描
I'll run the standard synaptic.

709
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,680
下载恐怖分子的数据
Upload your data on the raid.

710
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,410
看看九世到底跟你说了什么
I'll find out exactly what Kuze told you.

711
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,330
你知道他说了什么
You know what he told me.

712
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,130
真相
The truth.

713
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:05,120
你要删除我的记忆是吗
You're deleting everything, aren't you?

714
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,450
不
No.

715
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,180
所以我也会不记得
So I don't remember...

716
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,140
你
You.

717
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,080
我是蜜拉·凯莉恩少校

我不同意你删除这些数据

720
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,030
我不同意删除
I do not consent.

721
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:41,170
我们不需要你同意
We never needed your consent.

722
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,000
不需要任何人同意
Yours or anyone's.

723
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,510
你要杀了我
You're killing me...

724
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,250
是不是
Right you...?

725
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,860
蜜拉
Mira?

726
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,600
你能听到吗
Do you hear me?

727
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,590
蜜拉
Mira?

728
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:31,580
这是你真实的过去 拿着它
This is your past, your real past. Take it.

729
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:34,750
- 警卫  - 快走快走
- Guards!  - Come on, come on!

730
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:36,210
快点走
Come on, go!

731
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,580
走
Go!

732
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,180

Go!

733

安全警报在二十五楼

734
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,420

谢谢你的合作
Thank you for your cooperation.

737
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,860
这就是人心带来的问题
That's the problem with the human heart.

738
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,920
我要扫描看她在哪里
I want to see her scan.

739
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,870
她杀了欧莱特博士
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

740
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,900
你不能再找她了 阪华机械的保安队正在抓她
You are to have no further contact with her. Hanka security will hunt her from here.

741
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,300

- What are the orders?  - To terminate on sight.

742
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,100
你想杀了她 是你制造了她
You want to kill her? You built her!

743
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:09,530
- 让你的手下退下  - 少校不可能杀欧莱特博士
- Have your sergeant stand down.  - The Major would never hurt Dr. Oulete.

744
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,480
她现在已经不是少校了
She is not the major anymore!

745
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:14,580
九课的人员被恐怖分子策反控制
We have a section 9 operative under terrorist programming.

746
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,590
这件事要是传出去 你们就完了
This goes public your unit goes down.

747
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,980
你想杀她
You kill her...

748
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,080
必须先杀了我们
You kill us.

749
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,230
我会好好考虑你们的意见
I'll take that under advice.

750
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,540
现在怎么办
So what now?

751
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,940
[素子故乡]

752
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,400
喔 小南瓜
Oh, the puppy.

753
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,170
喔 你吓了我一跳
Oh, you surprised me.

754
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,710
它喜欢你
She likes you.

755
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,590
我要找…
I was looking for...

756
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,780
进来吧
No, come in.

757
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,630
来 快进来
Yeah, go, come come.

758
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:49,300
- 你喝茶吗  - 好的
- Can I offer you some tea?  - Okay.

759
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,760
那是素子的房间
That... Motoko's room.

760
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,780
我女儿一年前去世了
My daughter died a year ago.

761
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,150
对不起
I am Sorry.

762
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,370
她离家出走
She run away.

763
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,110
那孩子比较叛逆
She was a difficult.

764
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,440
我们常吵架
We fought.

765
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,760
但我想父母跟孩子那能不吵架的
But I guess we all fight with our parents, right?

766
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,690
请坐在这边
Please come on the sit.

767
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,680
她怎么死的
What happened to your her?

768
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,140
我不知道
I don't know.

769
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:58,500
政府的人把她的骨灰送回来
The ministry sent me her ashes, and...

770
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:02,460
他们说我的女儿自杀了
They told me she took her own life.

771
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:08,970
可是素子 不…
But Motoko... No, no, no.

772
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,260
我不相信他们
I never believe them.

773
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,830
她过得很开心
She was happy...

774
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,570
跟一群朋友住在不法之地
living in the lawless zone with her friends.

775
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:22,770
而且到处跟别人说
She'd write her manifestos about...

776
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,540
科技的发展到最后
how technology was...

777
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,610
会毁灭这个世界
destroying the world.

778
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,240
然后有一天
Then one day...

779
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,650
警察来了
the police came...

780
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,720
他们就跑了
and they run.

781
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,430
真奇怪
It's strange.

782
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:56,860
我在很多女孩身上看到了她的身影
I see her in so many young women.

783
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:00,960
在大街上 在我梦中
On the street, in my dreams.

784
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,140
就好像她还活着
As if she is still here.

785
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,840
素子她…
She was...

786
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,030
很勇敢
fearless.

787
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,540
无所畏惧
And wild.

788
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,660
你让我想起了她
You remind me of her.

789
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,240
对不起
Sorry.

790
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,760
我什么地方让你想起她
Why do I remind you of her?

791
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,120
是你看我的眼神
The way you look at me.

792
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,570
你到底是谁
Who are you?

793
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,700
我不知道
I don't know.

794
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,860
等等 等一下
Wait, wait, wait!

795
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,300
你还会再来看我吗
Will you come again to visit me?

796
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,260
我会的
I will.

797
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,210
荒卷课长
Aramaki.

798
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,160
你听我说
Listen to me.

799
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,130
根本就没有恐怖袭击
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

800
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,840
我的父母
My parents...

801
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:31,110
一切都是他们植入的虚假记忆
Everything was data they installed in my mind.

802
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:36,470
而且还有其他像我这样逃家的人
And there were others. Run-aways like me...

803
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,070
都被他们抓去做人体实验
considered disposable.

804
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,660
九世就是其中之一 所以他要找阪华机械
Kuze was one of them. That's why he's coming.

805
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,970

To Hanka.

806
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,190
你有什么证据
Can you prove this?

807
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,260
欧莱特博士可以做证
Dr. Ouelet can.

808
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,470
欧莱特博士已经死了
Ouelet's dead.

809
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,450
卡特社长说是你杀了她
Cutter says you killed her.

810
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,670
把我放上网路 我要引出九世
Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.

811
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,400
这样卡特就会知道你的位置
We will be exposed to Cutter.

812
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:14,710
我知道 但我必须这样做
I know, but I have to do this.

813
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,820
我要和总理会面

814
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:22,810
必须让卡特收手

815
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,200
病毒已经扩散了
The virus has spread.

816
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,880
呼叫九课的队员 监视网路通讯
All agents stick to mental comms.

817
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,150
别找兔子…来杀狐狸送死
Don't send a rabbit... to kill a fox.

818
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,350
我们被盯上了
We are burned.

819
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,280
重覆
I repeat.

820
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,410
我们被盯上了
We are burned.

821
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:02,750
报告社长 已掌握少校行踪

822

她在不法之地

823
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:06,180
空中支援在五分钟后抵达

824
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,380
蜘蛛坦克能否赶到现场

825
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:13,060
可以 等候社长指示

826

829

我想起卡特他们

Cutter and his men. This is where they took us from.

831

一群逃家的人
All of us run away.

834
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,460
除了彼此
We had nothing...

835
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:13,090
我们一无所有
except each other.

836
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:18,760
可是连这个也被夺走了
They took that from us.

01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:32,720
快到了 社长
Approaching the target now sir.

859
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,600
跟我来吧
Come with me.

860
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,920
这里没有我们的容身之处
There is no place for us here.

861
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,990
不
No.

862
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:55,100
我不能离开这里
I'm not ready to leave.

863
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,350
我属于这里
I belong here.

864
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,850
我会永远和你在一起
I'll always be there with you...

865
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:07,660
在你的灵魂深处
your ghost.

866
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,420
已经锁定目标
Target is in view.

867
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,300
那你还等什么
What are you waiting for?

868
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:18,510
开枪
Do it!

869
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,440
不
No!

870
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,590
继续射击
Keep firing.

871
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,720
斋藤 你找到少校了吗 她没事吧
Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?

872
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:33,480
她会没事的
She will be.

873
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:57,030
嘿
Hey...

874
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:00,560
嘿
Hey.

875
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:06,310
说点好听的
Say something nice.

876
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,250
你叫什么
What's your name?

877
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:13,180
荒卷告诉我 你之前有个名字
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.

878
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,800
我叫素子
Motoko.

879
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,570
我们的少校并没有离开 对吧
Major still in there, right?

880
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:28,980
是的
I am.

881
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:45,740
卡特社长
Mr. Cutter.

882
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,510
我和总理谈过
I talked with the Prime Minister.

883
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,100
你被指控谋杀平民与叛国罪行
You are accused of murder and crimes against the state.

884
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,710
我就知道会是你
I thought that it might be you.

885
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:05,000
拒捕将就地正法
It is unwise to resist.

886
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,290
别杀我
Please.

887
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:27,910
少校
Major?

888
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,810
对于卡特社长
I am with Cutter.

889
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,610
你有什么要对他说 在杀他之前
Do you wanna say anything before I kill him?

890
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,450
告诉他这就是正义
Tell him this is justice.

891
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,980
就是我存在的意义
It's what I was built for.

892
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:42,440
请确认就地正法
So do you give consent?

893
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,030
我是少校
My name is Major.

894
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:47,900
我同意你把他删除
And I give my consent.

895
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:39,780
[草薙素子]

896
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:01,300
你以后不用再来这里了
You don't have to come here anymore.

897
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,620
我知道
I know.

898
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,870
我的心属于人类
My mind is human.

899
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,420
但身体却是机械做的
My body is manufactured.

900
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,400
我是第一个全身义体化人脑机器人
I am the first of my kind, but...

901
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,770
但不会是最后一个
I won't be the last.

902
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:01,560
我们执着于记忆 觉得它定义了我们
We cling to memories as if they define us.

903
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,710
但定义我们的是我们的行为
But what we do defines us.

904
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:15,260
我的灵魂活着 提醒未来的义体化机器人
My ghost survived to remind the next of us...

905
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,330
人性才是我们的美德
that humanity is our virtue.

906
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:23,100
我知道我是谁
I know who I am...

907
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:25,980
我要做什么
and what I'm here to do.

908
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,320
少校
Major.

909
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,350
目标已确认
Engage targets.

910
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,770
授权你 攻击
You're authorized.
