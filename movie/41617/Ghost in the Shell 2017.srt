Dr.. Dahlin,你弄完了吗?
Dr.. Dahlin! Are you finished yet?

254
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:50,893
如果你没有 用大量子弹 射击艺妓机器人
If you hadn't rained all the Geisha with the bullets,

255
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:52,008
这会简单一点
This would be much easier.

256

我没有射他
是我射的

这工作要花好几天

258
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,860
我必须执行 好几百个可能的模拟

我们没有时间了

她以前是Hanka公司的机器人

但是 她的大脑被骇入,程式被窜改

她的硬碟里有什么?

263
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:19,163
没有东西.资料都被摧毁 当它被运来的时候

没有迹象显示 她是来做什么的

265
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,985
硬体被毁坏了

266

他们把它破坏得很彻底
They ripped her up.

267
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,964
我必须做个深潜 进入它的大脑,来找出线索
Then I have to do a deep dive.

268
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,625
做深潜 你将无法 加密保护自己
You can't encrypt you in the deep dive

269
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:33,264
我知道
I know it.

270
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:39,147
他们可以在她身上留下陷阱.大量的脉冲波,病毒
They could left traps in her.Mag pulses, viruses.

271
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,580
她是对的
She is right.

272
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:46,394
你会暴露你的心智给骇入她的人.你将会门户大开.
You will be exposing your mind to who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

273
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:52,911
我必须进入她的记忆中.这是最快找到Kuze的方法
I have to get inside her memory.It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

274
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,319
那太危险了
It's too dangerous.

275
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:03,005
而且一点也不可靠
And highly irresponsible.

The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

481
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:02,651
而且 不知怎么地 植入了一个新的现实

482
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:05,647
至少 他相信他有一个孩子

都是噪声,毫无意义
Just noise.

488
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:21,688
是他
It's him.

489
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:26,217
他来了
He is in there.

490
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:31,247
这隔间是安全有屏蔽的.他不可能进得来.少校
This cube is secure. He can't be, Major.

491
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:32,961
测谎仪

492
00:49:33,185 --> 00:49:34,610
他一定是从那入侵的
He must have hacked in that way.

493
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,540
我们必须上传到机器.追踪编码.锁定他的位置
We should uplink to the machine,trace the code, get a lock on his location.

494
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:38,564

太危险了
Don't go in there.

497
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,283
我们不知道他还能做什么
We don't know what else he can do.

498
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:00,396
讯号不是很稳定
我们能锁定他吗?
The signal is unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?

499
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,765
我们必须快点.我们快要失去他了

我知道为什么,我们无法找到他了
I knew why we could not find him.

526
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:41,917
他利用人类的心智,来制造一个属于他自己的网路
He is using human minds to create a network of his own.

527
00:53:42,249 --> 00:53:43,559

我把你,连线到我自创的网路上
I have, connected you,to a network of my own creation.

534
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,083
当我在这个世界死去后..
When I am finished in this world...

535
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:35,752
我的灵魂可以在那里 生存,然后再生

你想对我怎么样??

537
00:55:39,552 --> 00:55:41,014

很著迷
Fascinated with you...

539
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:47,576
当你在那艺妓机器人里面时
Reading your code...

540
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:50,472
我读取你的编码
when you were inside that geisha.

541
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:56,650
我从来没有感觉到 是如此的

亲近 熟悉
Familiar.

543
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:03,225
我们是一样的
We are the same.

00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:05,343
我们不一样
We are not the same.

545
00:56:08,052 --> 00:56:09,980
你杀害无辜的人
You kill innocent people.

546
00:56:10,652 --> 00:56:13,104
无辜?你认为他们无辜吗?
Innocent? Is that the..what you call them?

547
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,750
我被他们 制造成这样
I am as they need me.

548
00:56:17,532 --> 00:56:18,818
是谁制造你的?
Who made you?

549
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:21,026
他们是怎样告诉你的?
What have they told you?

550
00:56:21,532 --> 00:56:23,652
说你是第一个
That you were the first?

551
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:26,586
第一个大脑抢救成功的人
The first cerebral salvage.

552
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:33,204
你是我失败教训后 出生的
You were born of lessons that I was failed...

553
00:56:33,618 --> 00:56:33,780


554
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,765
你在胡说些甚么?
What are you talking about?

555
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:43,154
我还神智清醒时,他们支解我的躯体时,然后G弃了我
I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me

556
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:45,423
如同垃圾一样
like garbage.

557
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:49,073
我躺在手术台上
I was lying on a table...

558
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:54,313
听着医生说 我的心智无法匹配
Listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not matched with the shell.

559
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:56,667
他们造的躯壳
That they had built.

560
00:56:57,198 --> 00:57:00,977
我就是专案计画2571的产物
I'm projected to 2571...

561
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:03,261
而且是 失败的产物
had failed...

562
00:57:03,604 --> 00:57:05,447
然而 他们继续执行计画
and they had to move on...

563
00:57:11,752 --> 00:57:12,934
在你身上
to you.

564
00:57:20,214 --> 00:57:22,553
你真漂亮
Morning beauty you are.

565
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:28,121
他们把你改进了许多
They have improved you so much...

566
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:30,254
在制造我以后
since they made me.

567
00:57:33,403 --> 00:57:37,579
他们认为我们会是 他们人类未来进化的一部分
They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.

568
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:42,256
但是 他们制造我们 好让他们能进化
But they have created us to evolve alone...

569
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:42,954
...

570
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:49,214
超越他们自己
beyond them.

571
00:57:49,656 --> 00:57:52,199
那就是你所说的进化吗?
Evolution? That's what you call?

572
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,945
杀掉每个制造你的人
Killing everyone who made you?

573
00:57:55,394 --> 00:57:57,653
你根本没有 听进我所说的话
You are not listening to me.

574
00:57:58,246 --> 00:57:59,753
你是杀人凶手
You are murderer.

575
00:58:00,129 --> 00:58:03,057
是他们先要杀掉我的
They tried to kill me first.

576
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:06,817
我是出于自卫
It is self-defense.

577
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:08,997
保护我自己
The defense of myself.

578
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:13,409
还会死更多人
More will die...

579
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:17,455
直到他们告诉我
until they tell me...

580
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:19,468
他们从我身上拿走了什么
what they took.

581
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:21,051
我绝不允许你继续杀人
I won't let that happen.

582
00:58:23,395 --> 00:58:24,932
你要杀了我吗?
You want to kill me?

583
00:58:29,455 --> 00:58:31,407
如同其他人一样
Like everyone else.

584
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:39,393
那就杀吧
Do it, then.

585
00:58:42,775 --> 00:58:44,854
做你的程式要你做的
Do what you are programmed to do.

586
00:58:56,842 --> 00:58:58,036
那是什么?
What is that?

587
00:59:10,176 --> 00:59:11,741
那是什么?
What is that?

588
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:17,239
我不记得了,但是它经常缠绕着我
I kick in to remember,but I am haunted by it.

589
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:20,031
你看过它吗?
Do You see it?

590
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:26,611
Togusa!

591
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:35,812
不要服用他们给你的药物
Don't take the medication that they gave you..

592
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:39,203
他们用药物抑制你的记忆
They use it to suppress your memories.

593
00:59:39,797 --> 00:59:43,508
你的躯躯壳属于他们的,但是 你的灵魂不是
Your shell belongs to them,but not your ghost.

594
00:59:44,254 --> 00:59:45,956
你的灵魂是你自己的
Your ghost is yours.

595
00:59:46,406 --> 00:59:47,803
记住我的话
Remember that...

596
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,992
也许 你能想起 过去的一切
and maybe you can remember it all.

597
00:59:59,357 --> 01:00:01,758
离她远一点
给我趴在地上
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.

598
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,022
少校
Major..

599
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,785
少校
Major!

600
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,504
很多
Dozens.

601
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:30,717
有多少
How many?

602
01:00:34,604 --> 01:00:37,707
在你之前,有98个实验 没有成功
98 unsuccessful attempts before you.

603
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:42,286
你杀了98个无辜的人
You killed 98 innocent people.

604
01:00:42,486 --> 01:00:44,933
不,我没有杀过任何人
No, I didn't kill anyone.

605
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:47,249
如果不是 那些实验
if it weren't for those experiments.

606
01:00:47,546 --> 01:00:50,394
你不会存在,你也不会在这里
You would not exist .You wouldn't be here

607
01:00:50,675 --> 01:00:52,203
实验?
Experiments?

608
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:56,291
我是你的实验品
不
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

609
01:00:58,509 --> 01:00:59,979
不,Mira
No, Mira!

610
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:07,338
牺牲是必须的
Sacrifices were made.

611
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:11,819
那些躯体是从哪来的?
Where did the bodies come from?

612
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:15,905
我是从哪来的?
Where did I come from?

613
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:19,606
Mr. Cutter 把他们 带来给我们的
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

614
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:22,061
我没有多问他
I did not ask questions.

615
01:01:22,235 --> 01:01:23,455
港口
The harbor.

616
01:01:24,271 --> 01:01:25,771
我的父母
My parents.

617
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:28,123
他们的死因
The way they died.

618
01:01:30,147 --> 01:01:31,518
是真的吗?
Did that happen?

619
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:35,823
不
No.

620
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,388
是我们给你 植入的假记忆
We gave you false memories.

621
01:01:42,656 --> 01:01:44,405
Cutter想以此 激励你
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

622
01:01:44,977 --> 01:01:47,251
用以 打击恐怖份子
我没有同意
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

623
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,005
这很残忍,但我的工作 很重要
It was cruel, but my work,that was important, and...

624
01:01:51,764 --> 01:01:53,265
所以你诞生了
you were born.

625
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:57,533
你是如此漂亮 完美
You were so beautiful.

626
01:01:58,646 --> 01:02:00,811
我拥有的 都是假的
Nothing I have is real.

627
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,301
我找到他了
I found him.

628
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:07,681
我告诉过你 要小心
I told you to be careful.

629
01:02:08,056 --> 01:02:10,667
你一直 都知道他是谁
You knew who he was the whole time.

630
01:02:10,976 --> 01:02:12,135
是你制造他的
You built him.

631
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:14,977
他有一个
He had a..

632
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,465
不稳定的暴力心智
Violent unstable mind.

633
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,191
他的大脑连接 不受约束
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

634
01:02:21,636 --> 01:02:23,766
我试过救他
不
- I tried to save him!
- No.

635
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:26,260
你留下他等死
You left him to die.

636
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:40,913
还没找到Kuze,先生
待会儿,检查上层区域
Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.

637
01:02:42,414 --> 01:02:44,137
有少校的消息吗?
Is there any word on Major?

638
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:48,734
她悄悄地走了,离开了 "网格"
She's gone.Off-grid. Silent.

639
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:51,770
收到,先生
Copy that, sir.

640
01:02:52,195 --> 01:02:54,104
我知道哪里可以找到她
I know where to find her.

641
01:02:55,104 --> 01:03:06,104
注解:"网格" 是用大批个人电脑,相互网路链接,分散运算
达到 超级电脑 的运算速度

642
01:03:37,973 --> 01:03:39,862
我没叫你过来这里
I didn't ask you to come here.

643
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:42,522
你从来不叫我
You never ask.

644
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:44,633
可是我每次都来
But I always do.

645
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:50,959
是他们派你来 带我回去吗?
Did they send you to bring me in?

646
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:55,410
我是来这里钓鱼的,你看到鱼吗?
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

647
01:03:55,767 --> 01:04:00,024
你是公司的人马,你要遵守规定.
如果他们要你杀掉我呢?
You are a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me.

648
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:03,140
e说那些屁话. 会惹我生气的.
Stop saying shit like that.You're gonna piss me off.

649
01:04:25,938 --> 01:04:27,594
水下面怎么样?
What's it like down there?

650
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:31,096
又冷 又黑
It's Cold and dark.

651
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:34,459
好像另一个世界
Just a million miles away.

652
01:04:35,732 --> 01:04:37,268
没有声音
No voices.

653
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,782
没有网路数据流
No data streaming.

654
01:04:41,153 --> 01:04:42,153
什么东西
Just...

655
01:04:45,706 --> 01:04:46,706
都没有
nothing.

656
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,168
很吓人
那,你为什么要下水
- It scares me.
- Then Why do you do it?

657
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:02,598
有真实感
It feels real.

658
01:05:03,577 --> 01:05:05,460
为什么你不阻止Kuze?
Why didn't you stop him?

659
01:05:08,841 --> 01:05:11,323
我不知道 还有谁 可以相信
I don't know who to trust anymore.

660
01:05:11,968 --> 01:05:13,538
你信任我,对吗?
You trust me, right?

661
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:20,470
是的,我信得过 你
Yes I do.

662
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:24,457
只是 不喜欢 像你一样
I just don't like it.

663
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,792
我需要你带我回去
I need you to take me back.

664
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:36,916
还有很多事要查
There is more I need to find out.

665
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,676
好吧
Sure.

666
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,199
Dr. Ouelet...

667
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:04,586
你告诉了她什么?
What have you told her?

668
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:08,512
她知道
She knows.

669
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:11,217
我要抓她 回来
I'm bringing her in.

670
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:43,825
Hanka 保安 向总部报告
Hanka security to Headquarters.

671
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,686
我们抓到 少校了
We have the Major.

672
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:25,067
为什么给她 打镇静剂?
Why is she sedated?

673
01:07:25,807 --> 01:07:28,040
她被恐怖份子 策反了
She's been turned by a terrorist.

674
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,746
但 你已经知道
But you know that already.

675
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:36,060
她去找你时,你就应该 通知我了
You should have called the first time she came to see you.

676
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,069
然而, 你却告诉她一切讯息
Instead, you gave her information.

677
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,445
凭什么让你认为 你有...
What makes you think you have the..

678
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:43,213
权力告诉我这些?
2571计画 让我们关门了
- Right to tell me that?
- 2-5-7-1 took us close.

679
01:07:44,113 --> 01:07:45,833
该是走向 下一个阶段的时刻
It's time to move on to the next iteration.

680
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:47,370
2571计画没有失败
2-5-7-1 is not a failure.

681
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,561
我可以 删除她所有的资料,重新给她输入程式
I will delete all the data and reprogram her.

682
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,772
她将 完全不记得他(Kuze)
不 不 不 不
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no, no.

683
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,187
你把所有恐怖份子的数据,都下载下来
You download all the data on the terrorist...

684
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:59,505
然后 我会命令你 终止执行计画
and then I order you to terminate.

685
01:08:02,601 --> 01:08:05,159
什么?
我们要制造一个更好的
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

686
01:08:06,274 --> 01:08:09,956
我会删除所有的东西
你以前也删除过
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

687
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,558
她(少校)是我的
不
- She's mine.
- No.

688
01:08:14,911 --> 01:08:17,067
她(少校)是你我合约的一部分
She is a contract... with me.

689
01:08:17,383 --> 01:08:18,965
我们成功了
We succeeded.

690
01:08:19,368 --> 01:08:22,687
她比人类强,也比 人工智慧机器人 强
She is more than human... and more than AI.

691
01:08:23,056 --> 01:08:27,088
我们改变了她整个身体
但她的灵魂还在
We change her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

692
01:08:27,393 --> 01:08:29,548
她的灵魂 就是 让我们失败的原因
Her ghost is what failed us.

693
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,607
我们无法控制她.她已经没有价值了
We can not control her. She is no longer a viable asset.

694
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:41,453
应该由你 处理掉 她
You should be the one to do it.

695
01:08:51,097 --> 01:08:53,030
你要对我做甚么?
What are you doing to me?

696
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:57,188
我要执行标实 脑部突触神经 扫瞄

我不会是最后一个

我们执著於记忆 来定义我们

890

但是 定义我们的 是我们的行为
