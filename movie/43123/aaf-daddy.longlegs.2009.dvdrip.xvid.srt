1
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,954
- Yes.
- Let me have one foot long.

2
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,792
- Foot long?
- Yeah foot long.

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,349
- $1.50.
- Do you have a foot long hotdog?

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,509
No, we don't.

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,753
Oh, Man... uhmm I'll just have
two regular ones then...

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,077
Yeah, just like that.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,192
Yeah, can I have
some Ketchup on that?

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,759
Ketchup?

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,911
Holy shit.

10
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,512
Fuck... What's happening Alex?

11
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,433
Hey Lenny, uhm...
my mom talked to...

12
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,716
Yeah, have you seen,
have you seen Sage?

13
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,714
No, but my mom talked
to Sage's Mom and told her that...

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,599
You know,
I could go to your house.

15
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,751
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

16
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,076
Excuse me.

17
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,719
- Are you there father?
- Yes!

18
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,916
OK. Well you have
some parenting to do.

19
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,798
Really? OK I have
some parenting to do?

20
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,473
- Yes you do.
- Who are you?

21
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,596
I am the principal of this school,
Mr. Puccio...

22
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,113
Puccio?!

23
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,714
I don't think this is a matter
for laughter right now...

24
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,871
- Let me tell you what happened today.
- Alright, I suggest you do that.

25
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,110
First of all, Frey assaulted
his math teacher.

26
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,316
OK, the kid is the size of
a two year old,

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,835
so I don't know what kind of ruckus
he'd be causing in your classroom.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,036
Kids do not assault teachers, OK?

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,191
And wait let me show you
something else.

30
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,999
- Take a look at this.
- Alright just shut your mouth,

31
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,434
shut up.

32
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,240
Holy shit...
This is fucking disgusting.

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,198
Excuse me! Do not use
that kind of language here.

34
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,149
Do not reprimand me
in front of my own kids! Alright?!

35
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,357
Excuse me, that hair came
from one of his classmates, Brandon.

36
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,512
Just calm down for a second,
I'd like to hear what happened.

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,717
Brandon was beating up Johnny...
I don't like that.

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,919
Maybe this would be more productive
if you came back with their mother.

39
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,877
Alright, C'mon guys.

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,515
What? What are you doing?

41
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,272
You know we have things to do.
Okay?

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,715
I'm sorry it was nice to see you,
you'll see him at school tomorrow.

43
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,871
But wait...
But my mom isn't here yet.

44
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,998
No moms, no playdates,
nothing today. Okay?

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,238
- And you? What is this?!
- Brandon was teasing.

46
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,960
You know what? Pull his hair!
Pull his hair!

47
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,157
- No.
- Pull his hair! Pull it!

48
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,954
You like that?
You like how that feels?

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,197
C'mon. That's disgusting!

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,518
Hey guys! I always wanted
a blonde mustache,

51
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,671
how do I look? Fancy?

52
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,149
Yeah, that's hilarious.
Henny Youngman over here.

53
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,072
How you doing sir?
Can you spare some change?

54
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,559
How's it going partner?

55
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,757
Trying to make some money,
and get something to eat.

56
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,911
- Something to eat?
- Yes... Um...

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,311
You know a lot of guys act like
their vets, and they really not vets.

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,395
I was stationed at Fort Jackson...
1968, 101st airborne.

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,269
- Is that-is that Virginia?
- No Columbia, South Carolina.

60
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,236
- The ditches?
- Yeah... 10 kills.

61
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,790
Tell you what we're gonna do,
I'm just gonna 20 dollars in my pocket,

62
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,269
so I can get home, but I'll be back
to check on you though man.

63
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,149
Hey! I won't be here! I'll be in a hotel
somewhere and I'll be eating.

64
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,151
It's on you brother,
you're talking to a fellow vet.

65
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,991
Thank you.

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,236
- Has anyone seen Frey?
- Nope.

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,868
Alright, I'm sure
he'll catch up with us...

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,118
- Hey Alex, what time is your bed time?
- Um, 8. I like it, it's early.

69
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,788
Really? Sage tell him
what time you go to bed.

70
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,032
- Eleven. - See, because
he's a grown up, that's why.

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,395
You must be tired
when you wake up!

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,955
Spare some change?

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,839
Sorry man, ask this guy,
he's the bread winner.

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,629
- Young man, spare some change?
- We're in the middle of a conversation.

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,633
I... Uh... Have to use that round...

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,439
There's water in it
that you urinate in.

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,070
- Toilet! It's in there!
- Bathroom. I forgot the name.

78
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,231
You're addressing the wrong guy,
this is the bank...

79
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,833
Show him what you've got.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,912
Don't give it to him,
I said show it to him.

81
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,669
I bet you got some money
in your pocket. I bet you got some.

82
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,434
Hey! He some money,
he gave you all that right?

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,989
You got some money
in your pockets! I bet you do.

84
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,674
Look, you don't want them to see
you looking bad like that, c'mon on?

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,718
Look man. I'm playing with my kids,
you asked for money.

86
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,998
We don't have any.
Just a little distance, alright?

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,597
- Good luck.
- But I've been sitting on my ass all day!

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,160
Well I've been
on my feet all day man!

89
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,229
Alright, c'mon. Forget the money,
c'mon guys! Forget it!

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,798
Alright, no joking. No joking
when we cross the streets.

91
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,996
Hold on to my belt loops.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,516
I can't see Sage!
Are you holding onto my belt loops?

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,513
Hey Buddy?

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,670
What's shaking buddy?

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,319
This is for real...

96
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,552
This one counts...

97
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,594
- So the score is 10 - 0.
- What is it? 0 - 0?

98
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,711
Just play!

99
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,957
Shoot it! Shoot it!

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,628
Aww, Swiss Cheese...
Guys, that's pathetic.

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,313
I'm Serving, I'm Serving.

102
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,675
Alright, this is going to be
even more pathetic.

103
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,912
I got it! I got it!

104
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,119
Whoa! Whoa! That's how someone
gonna get hurt. Hey, hey!

105
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,431
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

106
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,316
What is this the time out corner?

107
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,670
Alright, I'll play by myself.

108
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,876
Whoa he's back...

109
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,391
Alright well that's what happens
when you've been a bad boy...

110
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,280
...you go to the time out corner...
Is that what your mom does?

111
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,998
Shut up.

112
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,679
- 55.
- Show me! Show me!

113
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,396
Guys! Oh God!

114
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,069
Oh... now we have revenge!
Now revenge of Lorenzo.

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,470
Revenge!

116
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,876
Alright guys let go,
I can't get up.

117
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,953
Come on, stop guys, I'm not kidding.
Guys let go of me!

118
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,838
Pile on! Pile on!

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,390
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

120
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,120
- You're suffocating him!
- Alright guys seriously get up.

121
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,238
- He's holding us!
- That's not possible!

122
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,358
They're holding me,
they're holding me!

123
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,354
Alright, OK, make 'em some breakfast,
guys go get some breakfast.

124
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,317
Off the bed! Go!

125
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,755
- Go buddy go!
- A whole lotta nothing.

126
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,032
Off you go, sorry buddy.

127
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,794
- What is this your feeding the kids?
- I don't know?

128
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,030
Look I brought some other stuff...

129
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,636
and the guy at the supermarket
you know what he said?

130
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,833
He said that one out of every
million boxes has a very...

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,956
special prize in it.

132
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,759
Very special prize in it alright.
You guys want to empty it out?

133
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,196
You want to empty it?
Open it up, open it up.

134
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,993
On the table.

135
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,393
Shoot!

136
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,637
A salamander!
A salamander!

137
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,553
Look at it!

138
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,598
Oh... my... god.
Let me see this.

139
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,716
- That's incredible!
- It's alive!

140
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,872
That is incredible!
Oh my god, seats guys.

141
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,511
Here sit down. Incredible!
Look at it's head, look at it shaking!

142
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,318
Oh wait, let me go find
something bigger,

143
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,277
or I'm gonna get a little home
or something for it okay.

144
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,079
Can you put it in my hands
I'll be safe with him.

145
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,435
I think the first thing we got to do
is we got to get a home for it.

146
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,070
Check this guy out!

147
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,390
Oh my god,
look at his head shaking.

148
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,235
Look at that... you can see
his digestive system,

149
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,839
maybe that's just dirt.
This is incredible guys.

150
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,635
Check it out guys.
What do we use for gravel?

151
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,358
We got this.

152
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,155
- Actually you know what.
- No, that's some of our food.

153
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,356
Oh my god, what is he doing?

154
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,714
Don't make it too wet.

155
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,471
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Not on the floor.

156
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,350
Hey! Hey! Hey!

157
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,234
If this thing gets in the walls,
I don't know what would happen.

158
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,231
Here let me help, let me help.

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,790
- I got it. Stop, stop.
- Look Lenny I got the Lizard!

160
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,959
OK, this is not a... Competition.
We're all here to share the lizard.

161
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,712
- It smells!
- First thing we're gonna do...

162
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,235
- Stop hogging it!
- On the table. Hogging it?!

163
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,834
- First of all it's not yours!
- Silence! Silence!

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,719
The one thing we can do
without removing it

165
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,395
and freaking it out, because now
it needs to adjust to a new home...

166
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,993
is name him...

167
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,116
Can I show you something
in the bathroom?

168
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,996
Just be gentle with him.
Hey, Lenny!

169
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,748
...he'll swallow.
Alright, alright.

170
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,551
- What?
- What was that in there?

171
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,110
What was that, you just like
slapped my hand away like that.

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,999
The kids, the kids are outside, okay,

173
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,714
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

174
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,435
Or Bob.

175
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,151
Hi spots, no Bob's too normal,
I like spots.

176
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,516
Spots, okay, spots.

177
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,471
I want commitment from you two,
bed time... Shake on it.

178
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,039
Okay, here we go,
we're gonna make you disappear.

179
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,278
Alright the magic words are
presto magic. You guys ready?

180
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,557
- And make us come back.
- Well, first things first.

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,232
Alright... one... two... Presto!

182
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,549
Magic!

183
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,439
Oh my god,
this is incredible they're gone.

184
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,592
I'm going to the movies.

185
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,435
Why don't you go talk to her?

186
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,795
I bet she likes smart guys.

187
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,788
- Get her, get her, get her.
- Excuse me!

188
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,235
- Excuse me!
- Louder!

189
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,519
Excuse me! I'm sorry, um, hey.

190
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,515
I'd like to buy a drink for the girl
over by the chalk board.

191
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,639
Which girl are you talking about?

192
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,189
The one right there
at the end of the bar,

193
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,678
in the white...
just a whiskey like I have.

194
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,390
- You made the right choice.
- Shut the fuck up.

195
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,516
You gotta look at her.

196
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,231
Good morning.
What's shaking?

197
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,273
How are you?

198
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,959
I'm fine.

199
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,915
I presume I should split.

200
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,709
You can hang out for a bit, because
I got to pack my stuff and get ready

201
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,836
because I am going
to go upstate today.

202
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
Far fucking out!
I fucking love it up there.

203
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,597
I love upstate so much.

204
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,435
I haven't been outside the city in
I think 4 years, you know.

205
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,113
Okay...

206
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,272
Alright guys, up and at 'em,

00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,709

211
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,871
Fantastic. That's hilarious.

212
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,476
We have fifteen minutes to get
our stuff together, we're going upstate!

213
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,029
- I don't want to go on vacation!
- Alright, come on.

214
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,634
- Pack your bags guys.
- I don't have any bags!

215
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,678
Use your school bags,

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,958
We're going upstate guys!
We're going upstate!

217
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,554
We have fifteen minutes!

218
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,995
Just pack your bags man.

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,032

220
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,760
I'm dumping 'em, I'm dumping 'em.

221
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,596
Do we need bathing suits?

222
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,079
- It was supposed to be a nice ride up...
- It is going to be a nice ride.

223
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,471
No, no that's not what I'm asking,

224
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,473
- No I was talking...
- No, let me finish, let me finish.

225
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,553
The guy called you,
and you just decided, that oh,

226
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,110
it would be a good thing to do that,
I'm going with my boyfriend out

227
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,239
to the countryside,
but let me tag along this guy.

228
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,157
What were you thinking!

229
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,996
He was feeling kind of overwhelmed
by the city

230
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
so I thought it would be a nice thing
to do if we brought...

231
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,632
We were supposed to be
a nice weekend.

232
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,791
- We are going to have a nice time.

236
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,114
- Not the three of us having a good time.
- We cans till have a good time.

237
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,034

253
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,269
Nothing, nothing.

254
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,079
"Now I was so frightened,
that I'll tell you but I have to.

255
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,676
I screamed and rode away
and lost my hook line and bate too."

256
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,876
- I thought this was supposed to rhyme.
- I had no idea he had kids.

257
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,076
"You only could play
if your belly had stars..."

258
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,710
I mean I'm crazy,

259
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,075
Crazy?! Your loco!
You're more than crazy.

260
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,915
Forget about crazy. Don't even

261
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,073
The guy comes in with his kids...

I can't stand music

267
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,831
I can't concentrate on the road

I'm sorry man, I shouldn't yell.

285
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,790
Hey, hey!

Just go back to sleep.

293
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,631
What are you doing?

294
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,560
You want me to drive the car?

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:29,795
As summer turns to fall..."

303
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,157
- I want that one.
- OK, this one is giant.

304
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,793
You broke my stick.

305
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,150
Come on guys,

306
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,155
We've got to get to the boat.
Come on!

307
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,278

who's going to bring the boat.

314
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,189
That's Frey... This is Firas.

315
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,912
- Your not gonna go water skiing?
- It's 50 degrees outside.

316
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,435
It's hot, the sun is up.

317
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,758
It's warm.

318
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,230
The summer is not over.

319
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,396
Excellent. Beautiful.

320
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,313

324
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,754

325
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,349
you always have to sit on the boat,
don't stand up...

326
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,592
Alright guys, I'll pick you up in

327
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,593
- No!

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,797
- Ah, he's gonna water ski.

Come on!

331
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,558
Oh, he's up!

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,309
Faster! Go Faster!

333
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,592
What do you guys think?

334
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,189
Look at what he's doing?

335
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,995
Hey, check it out guys.
Sage, Sage.

336
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,754
- Hi baby! - Over here,

337
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,911
Alright, what do you want me
to catch for dinner tonight.

338
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,469
- Salmon.
- Salmon, alright.

339
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,476
I learned this in the army.

340
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,474
Anchor me!
I got one! I got one!

341
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,918
It got away, it got away.
Hang on.

342
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,911
We're still going for salmon?

343
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,719
Alright hold onto my waste.

344
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,278
Alright guys, lower me, lower me.

345
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,236
Pull me in! Pull me in I got it!

346
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,279
Ah, it got away! It got away!

347
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,273
Holy shit, hey Firas!
What is that?

348
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,953
That's Terry.

349
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,116
Far Fucking out!

350
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,598
Mirand...

351
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,552
What do you want, Sage?

352
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,238
Ewww!

353
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,911
This is sticky and ugly.

354
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,354
Sorry, please take out
a sheet of paper.

355
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,796
Um, sit down please Fletcher,
come on guys.

356
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,157
Get out a piece of paper,
let's do a morning message.

357
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,950
Sit down please,
let's start off with that one.

358
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,234
Let's get a subtraction
problem in there.

359
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,756
I'm very sorry guys.

360
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,757
Alright guys, the other day
we were working on this problem,

361
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,559
and a lot of you guys had
some difficulty with it.

362
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,075
We tried to tally it up.
It's 11+8.

363
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,071
OK you guys ready for this?

364
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,071
What the heck?

365
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,192
It's on your back!

366
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,200
Benny, Benny, come on do it.
Let's do it.

367
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,948
You got this. You got it.

368
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,798
Write it, write down there.

369
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,270
What's the answer?
You got it, you can do it.

370
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,670
Did you get it right?
Guys, did he get it right?

371
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,353
Yes!

372
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,193
Come on Tristin.

373
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,036
Yo Sage.

374
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,875
You want to spray Miranda
with fart spray?

375
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,440
Smell it. See what she'll smell like.

376
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,353
So are you with us or not.

377
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,559
I mean I'd love to but I don't wanna.
I got in a lot of trouble already.

378
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,319
Fine by me!

379
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,993
I'll trail behind and see what...

380
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,033
It's gonna be
the laughing of a life time.

381
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,639
William, can I interest you
in some CD's.

382
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,949
No, no, no,
they're only five dollars a piece.

383
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,112
Yo my friend,

384
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,149
You a reggae man?
Yo reggae man.

385
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,878
Hey Mr. Ice cream, yo!

386
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,873
Let me help you.
Let me help you.

387
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,598
- Slow down, how you doing?
- I'm alright,

388
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,399
- I don't have any money man.
- Money! What do you mean money?

389
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,518
Hey don't fucking touch me,
I don't have any money all right.

390
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,079
You like Bill Withers?

391
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,674
Come on, come on,

392
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,389
How about this, Jeffery Lewis?
Hold on come here.

393
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,949
Are they for free?
I told you I don't have any money.

394
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,350
You don't have any money,
how did you buy that ice cream.

395
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,033
Here take some bread.

396
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,555
Take some bread? Who the fuck
do you think your talking to jackass?

397
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,915
- Here try this.
- Alright, game over, game over.

398
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,913
OK. That's cool, everything's cool.
Hurry up man.

399
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,833
- You want to hold the fucking cones?
- Yeah I'll hold the fucking cones.

400
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,958
You think this is a fucking game.
You think this is a fucking game, man.

401
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,872
- No, I don't.
- Yeah?

402
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,190
You want to see those people
your buying that ice cream for.

403
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,669
- Here.
- Everything's cool bro.

404
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,196
- Can't I just by some CD's?
- There ain't no CD's in there.

405
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,836
I'll hold on to you, Sage.

406
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,000
Hey guys! Guys!

407
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,270
What's happenin'?
Sorry, I'm late.

408
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,156
Where's the ice cream!?

409
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,673
You know what?

410
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,832
I had ice cream and if you kick me
like that you're not getting anything.

411
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,558
Can we have a play-date
with Djoume?

412
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,473
- Oh, give me a break. Guys.
- You wanna go to play?

413
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,676
- Yeah.
- Please.

414
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,796
It's not a good idea.

415
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,036
- Listen guys.
- Please.

416
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,869
Hey. Listen to me.
Calm down.

417
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,156
Alright. It was a rotten day today.

418
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,959
We're going home,
we're calming down, alright?

419
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,435
Yeah, but that's because
your making me tense... you know...

420
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,828
Alright.

421
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,674
I was in a great mood
when I dialed the phone.

422
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,035
You know,
my intention was to call you

423
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,031
and share with you
some very pleasant news.

424
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,156
We went upstate, you know...

425
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,111
Yes UP-state, does that sound like
I crossed state lines?

426
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,956
Look, you know what,
you're doing it right now.

427
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,348
You're doing it right now,

428
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,556
and I don't know what
your going to achieve with this.

429
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,635
What? Do you want me to just not
call you and give you updates?

430
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,039
You know I wish I had a...

431
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,714
Right, I'm gonna start tape
recording these conversations.

432
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,314
Because I'll rewind it and play it back,
and that's not how you said it.

433
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,710
That's not how you say it.

434
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,953
Yeah, they can hear us right now.

435
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,634
Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

436
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,712
Hey kids, hey guys.
Say hi to your mom.

437
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,030
- Hi mom. - Alright,
they're looking at me right now.

438
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,714
Yeah. No that's you,
you are perpetuating this.

439
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,714
You know what,
you have two choices right now.

440
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,110
One is you continue
acting the way your acting

441
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,875
and you watch me blow my top.
Or two I hang up on you.

442
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,270
Alright you got five... one.
Alright goodbye,

443
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,590
you made your choice, goodbye.

444
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,599
You see that guys? You see that?
That was awesome, huh.

445
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,396
Now I'm mad!

446
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,239
- Hello?
- Hey Lenny, open!

447
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,319
Alright guys...

448
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,680
- Hey what's shakin' Salvie.
- Hi guys? How are you Lee?

449
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,195
Come on in,
you picked a fantastic time.

450
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,351
- Salvie! Salvie.
- Hi kids, how are you guys?

451
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,308
You guys remember Salvie...
look's like he's got something.

452
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,038
This better be flattering.

453
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,476
So I arrived there.
They were fighting, bloody.

454
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,598
- Who was fighting?
- My brother and his wife.

455
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,599
- Your brother lives in Brooklyn?
- He lives in Brooklyn.

456
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,116
He was bloody fighting
with his wife.

457
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,748
- Today?
- Tonight.

458
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,876
Your brother lives
in Brooklyn right now?

459
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,996
- Yes, yes. He is living there.
- I didn't know this.

460
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,515
So anyway,
I could not stay there.

461
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,070
- So I went to that motel...
- Let me see what you got here.

462
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,436
So this is supposed to be me?

463
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,396
There we go, fantastic.

464
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,240
- Here's some gum.
- Fantastic.

465
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,475
...everybody was blind in that hotel.
Do you understand?

466
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,111
Which part? Salvie, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to follow you.

467
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,634
Oh my god. Let me eat these kids
and forget about this story.

468
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,789
What?

469
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,638
And by now your blood will be sweet.
Because I eat kids. I eat kids!

470
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,115
I will eat both of you.

471
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,199
Salvie.

472
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,398
Salvie's a monster!

473
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,039
Oh my god.

474
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,080
Do you mind Lee
if I eat one of them.

475
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,754
You stay like that. Just lie down
and I will walk on you,

476
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,912
but keep your stomach very strong.
I beg-

477
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,399
No! Him first!

478
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,313
I will begin with you now.
Are you able?

479
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,040
- Tell me. Are you able?
- Yes. I think.

480
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,031
Help me... I can't...

481
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,636
No! Stop! Get off!
You're hurting him! Get off!

482
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,598
What the fuck is going on here?
Are you alright?

483
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,990
Is he alright?
Are you kidding or not?

484
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,912
- He's not.
- Alright, he's joking with me.

485
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,798
- He's not.
- Yeah, he's smiling.

486
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,269
He's not. He's stepping on us.

487
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,590
Stepping on him!? How would you
like it if we stepped on you?

488
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,718
Alright. Fun time is done.
Time for bed. It's a school night.

489
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,836
I am strong enough for that.

490
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,956
Enough games, enough candy.
It's bed time, people.

491
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,519
- Pizza man!
- Quiet!

492
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,874
Come and get it,
you morons.

493
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,679
Don't make me come over there,
I'm not kidding.

494
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,598
Get in bed.

495
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,032
- Get back in bed.
- Fine.

496
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,192
You know what?
I'm gonna take all that candy

497
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,318
and I'm gonna flush it down the toilet,
how about that?

498
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,716
In bed. L-

499
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,479
"It's very fond indeed of
English school children,

500
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,677
they have a nice inky booky flavor.

501
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,511
Perhaps I will change my mind
and go to England with them..."

502
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,758
"You is disgusting!" Said the BFG.
"And you is an insult

503
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,196
to the Giant Peoples!"
Shouted blood Bottler.

504
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,273
Does anyone know
the Capital of Oklahoma?

505
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,429
Frey.

506
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,990
What was the question?

507
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,799
- Ben.
- Oklahoma City.

508
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,109
Oklahoma City, well done.

509
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,829
Class, this is a perfect example of
what happens when you pay attention

510
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,560
and when you don't pay attention,
okay. Very well done Ben.

511
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,193
Alright Rick, Rick,
you're all threaded up

512
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,316
and set to go man,
you hit screen in ten minutes, okay?

513
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,597
I'm threaded up? What do you mean?
No, no, aren't you working tonight.

514
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,399
No. I am not working tonight,
you are working tonight.

515
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,471
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no, what?

516
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,596
- Your on the schedule.
- No.

517
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,593
First of all I am not on the schedule,
and second of all we agreed to this,

518
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,432
you are working tonight,
I have to pick up my kids.

519
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,431
I just came in to drop off the log.

520
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,478
Alright, don't fuck with me man.
Okay, I have to pick up my kids.

521
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,438
I can't, remember we had that
conversation, I have things to do...

522
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,512
Alright. Alright.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

523
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,433
- I have no flexibility here.
- Neither do I.

524
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,239
- I'm already late.
- I can't help ya, I got to go.

525
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,879
Listen to me. Please.

526
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,076
No, no, no, your staying, this is
your night we talked about this.

527
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,470
- Next time. Next time.
- Alright this movie's not gonna be run.

528
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,119
I gotta go.

529
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,592
Where you going?

530
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,118
The kids are with their dad
this week, and you know,

531
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,316
I'm on vacation,
I'm supposed to have this time off.

532
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,995
Unfortunately my last interaction
with their dad was not very positive.

533
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,559
- Hello?!
- Your here! Finally.

534
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,312
I apologize, unreservedly.

535
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,994
- What are you doing here?
- You guys, I love you.

536
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,469
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Puccio, had to call me.

537
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,870
- You have no business being here.
- These are my kids...

538
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,031
what am I gonna do leave them
standing here waiting for you...

539
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,352
I apologize, something came up at work.
OK, but you know what this is my time.

540
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,511
You're not responsible enough
to be here to pick them up.

541
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,399
Alright, have been told in advance...

542
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,994
...that if daddy has an emergency,
their going to sit and wait,

543
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,513
there's no danger in that.

544
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,831
They cannot be standing here,
and the school is responsible,

545
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,037
and I am responsible and obviously
you don't think it's a big deal!

546
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,792
Okay, you're in charge
of the school stuff.

547
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,509
You're right! I am in charge,
you obviously can't be trusted!

548
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,148
It is your responsibility to make sure
he has my number,

549
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,356
when their with me,
so you should've informed them

550
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,239
- that for these two weeks they call me.
- They have to call their mother.

551
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,631
You know what I am not entertaining
this discussion. Hello.

552
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,835
This is my screw up.

553
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,672
I'm entitled to screw up
in my two weeks,

554
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,671
and you can screw up
for the rest of the year.

555
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,752
Right. You don't screw up.
Okay fantastic.

556
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,076
Say goodbye to your mom guys.

557
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,710
- I'm sorry about this guys, Lenny.
- I am right and you are wrong.

558
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,030
Goodbye!
Say goodbye to your mother.

559
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,635
Say bye to mom.
Come on. Say bye.

560
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,519
- Bye mom.
- We have got to seriously rush.

561
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,999
Sprint!

562
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,952
Whoo! Fantastic guys.

563
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,515
Alright, give me five.

564
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,748
What your looking for
is a little white circle,

565
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,957
its gonna appear in the upper
right hand corner, okay.

566
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,390
And it's going to appear
for four frames long.

567
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,471
Alright, film runs
at 24 four frames a second,

568
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,154
I don't know how long a human
blink is, but do not blink,

569
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,073
I want you focused intensely
on that upper right hand corner.

570
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
That is a secret signal
just for us, okay?

571
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,710
- Alright, what are you looking for?
- The white circle.

572
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,108
And what are you going to do
when you see it?

573
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,748
- I'm gonna flip the button.
- Alright.

574
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,438
You looking? Don't blink.

575
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,715
- Alright go.
- No.

576
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,553
- Go! Go!
- No.

577
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,830
"Why doesn’t the state just,
just put him away?"

578
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,917
Projection. Alright let's do it.

579
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,956
How you guys doing?
Comfortable?

580
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,798
- No.
- Yes.

581
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,231
Alright, you guys need anything
I'm right in the booth.

582
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,195
Right on the line,
right on the arrow.

583
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,952
- On the arrow?
- Yeah...

584
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,510
- Let's do a test for starters. Okay?
- Okay, one.

585
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,959
Yes!

586
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,108
Based on a true story.
"Hey Lenny, get me a cup of water!"

587
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,352
That's the boss.
And that's dad, "OK OK."

588
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,397
Water. And that's the boss's cup.

589
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,877
And then he's going into the bathroom
and peeing in the cup.

590
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,830
No description.
Penis. Boss cup.

591
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,158
Gulp gulp. "This tastes salty!"

592
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,629
I can't believe he actually
peed in the water.

593
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,155
- OK, so now...
- Let's do a thousand.

594
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,673
A thousand yeah.

595
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,318
Maybe it's 999.

596
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,150
999. OK, print.

597
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,833
Alright guys.

598
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,919
What'd I say.

599
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,470
- Sage jacket on.
- Why this is the good part.

600
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,113
We're going, put your jacket on,
I'm not kidding, put your jacket on.

601
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,999
Come on.

602
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,753
Hey guys! Hey.

603
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,828
Guys come on.

604
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,675
Sup, guys...
what's going on...

605
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,959
What's in the bags?

606
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,279
Get 'em!

607
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,198
It's going away!

608
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,278
- Hey! What is this? What is this?
- I don't know.

609
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,279
Get over here! Get over here!

610
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,871
- Jake, Jake, Jake...
- Hey man.

611
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,474
What's cooking?
You doing anything tonight?

612
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,198
- Uh, no I was just a...
- Alright,

613
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,920
I got a proposition for you alright,
I'll give you free reign over my place,

614
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,435
use it as a studio, get some work done,
you watch my kids for a few hours,

615
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,636
eat anything you want,
and in exchange...

616
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,109
Here's that Kurtzman
you've been Eyeing.

617
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,796
Come on. Do it.

618
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,477
- Yeah definitely.
- Far out.

619
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,677
Listen, I'm gonna take a shower.
45 minutes meet me at my place alright.

620
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,796
Yeah, OK. 45.

621
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,317
So you guys wanna do like,
good guys bad guys?

622
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,436
Like everyman for himself.

623
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,079
- Good guys bad guys.
- Push it open!

624
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,038
Jake. Jake. Look.

625
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,590
This guy could be dead,
or could be not.

626
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,111
Look what happened to his face.
You guys should paint these.

627
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,432
- No MSG.
- OK, one, OK. You finished?

628
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,151
OK, you order spring rolls,
and Coke a Cola, no MSG.

629
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,117
- I was kidding.
- Thank you.

630
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,749
What's up?

631
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,549
Nothing, I just, I haven't, I don't know.
I haven't seen you for a little while.

632
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,713
Your funny, your funny looking to me.
You look unfamiliar.

633
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,560
Funny Looking. Your hair got.

634
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,831
- What, more gray?
- Yeah.

635
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,879
- Yeah, there's less of it
- There is less of it and it's grey...

636
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,510
That's because Frey's
constantly yanking it out.

637
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,628
- Wow, that was fast.
- Thank you.

638
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,755
Jesus.

639
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,351
- Thank you.
- You first.

640
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,957
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, your coke. Ice. No MSG.

641
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,476
- Thanks.
- Enjoy your meal.

642
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,119
Thank you.

643
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,874
Oh! I had an Idea,

644
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,918
how about all of us
go upstate for a little while.

645
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,593
Why don't we just get out of the city
for a little while,

646
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,239
then it won't feel so hectic.

647
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,473
It's not going to be so chaotic
up there's fall foliage...

648
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,557
there's a lot of space for the kids
to run around,

649
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,551
they can do loops around the house.

650
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,393
Listen to me.
Conceptually that is a wonderful idea,

651
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,915
but on every other level
it is a horrible idea.

652
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,753
You understand that.
I don't think you have any sense,

653
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,195
what it's like for me right now,
you know.

654
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,352
This is what it's like being
inside my brain right now.

655
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,955
Okay, just... just...
just be a little bit more open,

656
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,953
like next time
we're all hanging out right.

657
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,112
- Yeah.
- I just want you to a...

658
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,560
- What?
- Just involve me a little bit more.

659
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,235
- Just, not even involve me...
- Okay, okay...

660
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,633
Okay, alright I'm sorry.

661
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,959
- Oh, fuck! Come on.
- Come on... no!

662
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,992
Fuck it! Forget it.

663
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,311
I can't pee for such a long time
you know.

664
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,158
So Frey, we're gonna do it okay.

665
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,631
Oh, cool! A fire truck.

666
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,588
- Is that pee?
- Yeah!

667
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,191
OK. OK.

668
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,557
Oh, yeah!

669
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,559
OK.

670
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,874
That's it.

671
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,830
Frey! Help it! It's under a bump,
quickly! We need to retreat!

672
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,392
- Hey! Oh!
- OK, done, done.

673
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,278
Truce, truce.

674
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,915
Done.

675
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,559
Alright.

676
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,313
Taxi!

677
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,229
Well let's walk the tracks.

678
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,070
I have a better Idea.

679
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,753
- What's that?
- I'll take a nap on the third rail,

680
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,069
how bout that.
Will you watch my stuff?

681
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,435
No, no, no. I'm actually serious.
Let's walk the tracks.

682
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,794
I'm actually serious too,

683
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,473
I'm gonna take a nap
on the third rail right there.

684
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,871
Yeah... that's gonna kill you.
This is gonna be fun. Let's go.

685
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,234
Alright.

686
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,911
- After you.
- With all do respect,

687
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,355
- that's a really stupid idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

688
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,478
- I still think your joking.
- I think your a stupid idea.

689
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,155
Go, I'll see you at the next station.

690
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,799
Sayonara.

691
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,511
- Leni!
- Yeah?

692
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,875
Hey.

693
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,871
Up and at 'em.
What's shaking man, how'd it go?

694
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,672
Fine, it was fine, until I,
I got peed on.

695
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,319
That sucks.

696
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,832
Well if it's any consolation,
my night was a complete bust man.

697
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,592
I completely wasted
the fucking Kurtzman.

698
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,557
Yeah. Whatever.

699
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,876
Listen... please don't ask me
to do this again.

700
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,628
It wasn't a favor man I paid you.

701
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,075
- Jesus.
- Hey.

702
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,073
- What the fuck happened to you?
- You mad at me.

703
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,073
For crying out loud.

704
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,235
Hello? Jeff you woke me up man,
what's going on?

705
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,319
No, no.

706
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,119
That is not possible man.
I've got my kids...

707
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,077
OK, I understand you have
two kids in the room,

708
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,437
but we have about a hundred prints here,
that need to be checked by tomorrow.

709
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,349
I'm sorry
I can't even think straight.

710
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,829
You know Chris and Rick
are working their asses off right now,

711
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,592
trying to get us ready for tomorrow.

712
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,070
You know what, but that's not
my problem... it's your problem!

713
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,673
Jeff? Jeff?

714
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,796
You know it was
my problem earlier today,

715
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,518
I had to clean up a bunch of
freaking comics

716
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,195
that were strewn all over the theater,
and I had to find people clean it up.

717
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,631
You know what! That was my problem,
and you know what else is my problem,

718
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,678
is when they run around this freaking
booth like its a freaking playground.

719
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,277
Alright, I'll have my girlfriend
watch the, alright, goodbye.

720
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,792
Listen, listen. OK I have to pull
an all nighter. OK.

721
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,916
OK. I can't watch the kids though.

722
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,833
Um, I don't think you understand,
I'm going to lose my job,

723
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,514
and I need somebody here
to watch them when the wake up.

724
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,910
Look, I would love to but I can't,
I just can't.

725
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,913
I've got to work in the morning.
I'm really, really sorry.

726
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,036
- I would love to watch the kids.
- I'll be right back.

727
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,191
Lenny? Where you going?

728
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,676
- Yeah!
- Jake. Listen, um,

729
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,310
I need you to watch my kids tomorrow
morning man, it's a real emergency, OK?

730
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,515
No way.

731
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,832
Listen to me Jake, please.
This is a dire situation OK,

732
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,639
- I'm going to lose my job.
- Sorry, no way.

733
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,710
Is there anyway
I can twist your arm man.

734
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,878
Come here, quick.

735
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,798
Come. Leni.

736
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,479
Goddamn it!

737
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,393
Listen, here's what we're gonna do.

738
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,918
- You see one of these?
- Yeah. Sure.

739
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,116
I take these when I want to sleep
through the garbage trucks in the morning

740
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,316
and just get an extra
three hours rest, okay.

741
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,993
- So we divide this up.
- Okay.

742
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,914
Give the kids a third each,
and then we're good to go.

743
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,958
I don't know if that's a good idea,
their just little kids, I don't know.

744
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,078
Listen to me, what's a worse idea is
if they wake up and nobody's here.

745
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,919
Do you understand that okay.
They're gonna freak the fuck out.

746
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,672
This is a sedative.

747
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,758
- It's cool.
- Okay.

748
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,753
Check it out, you see that?
That's like an eighth of a pill.

749
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,878
Okay, I think there may be
a little bit too much in there.

750
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,072
Alright, come on.

751
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,319
Come on!

752
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,479
Alright buddy.

753
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,955
OK, go back to sleep,
go back to sleep.

754
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,513
Alright buddy.

755
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,669
Lenny!

756
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,919
Alright buddy.

757
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,112
Alright guys. Let's do it.

758
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,671
Come one. Up.

759
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,879
Up!

760
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,873
I know you guys can hear me,
come on.

761
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,713
Alright. One... two... three.

762
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,268
Come on. Come on, I'm serious.

763
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,949
Crunch! Crack!
Come on guys.

764
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,398
Guys come on.

765
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,313
Come on!

766
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,230
- Stephen! Holy shit.
- Where are they?

767
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,958
They're right over here.

768
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,633
They've just been out like this
for the past...

769
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,109
Listen man, you know,
I take one of these pills

770
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,271
when I want to sleep
for an extra two hours, you know.

771
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,839
Are you sure you only
gave them an eighth?

772
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,230
I chopped up a little bit...

773
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,109
It was not more than that,
it was a pinch!

774
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,073
I'm telling you a whole one knocks
a full grown man out for two hours!

775
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,196
You got to back off.

776
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,189
Here, that was it, this is...

777
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,196
Is it possible it has something to do
with the tap water?

778
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,797
- I mixed it with tap water.
- No! Just be quiet.

779
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,709
- Maybe the pills were expired?
- Shut up! Stop it.

780
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,271
Their in what’s called
stage for sleep.

781
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,273
- What is that?
- It's like practically a coma.

782
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,271
But lucky for you
they'll wake up from it.

783
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,237
That means they're good.
They're fine.

784
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,233
- Yeah! They're not fine.
- You are so lucky.

785
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,916
I'm all fucked up man,
I don't know.

786
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,640
I mean, honestly if I wasn't your friend
I would've called the police.

787
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,793
You know... I'm a doctor...
I'm not supposed to be like.

788
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,157
So they don't need to go to the hospital,
they're okay just here.

789
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,880
So I don't have to tell...
I don't have to tell their mother.

790
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,439
They're going to be fine,
they'll wake up...

791
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,158
Well I don't know
when your talking to her.

792
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,117
It could be two days,
it could be a week,

793
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,475
- it could be up to four weeks.
- Holy shit!

794
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,675
It's not funny!

795
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,592
We don't need to go to a hospital
or anything like that.

796
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,796
- So I don't need to freak out right?
- They should be fine.

797
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,110
Is this like dangerous,
is there gonna be residual effects?

798
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,317
Like I said, they're fine.
I can't believe this.

799
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,469
Alright, well thanks for coming in.

800
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,679
Your welcome. I'm just glad
everything's okay.

801
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,389
- So we don't have to freak out.
- We don't have to freak out.

802
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,879
You just got to wait.

803
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,996
I just, you know, I just have
so much shit coming down at work,

804
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,914
I'm not thinking clearly, man you know.
I really appreciate this.

805
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,514
I just can't... I don't know
what's wrong with you.

806
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,433
If you weren't my friend
I would've called the police.

807
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,559
...alright you said that twice now.
- Thank you for coming by.

808
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,953
You know that song.
And what else did she do.

809
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,112
Of rainbows and flower...
Rainbows and...

810
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,076
Leslie Gould.
So that was your apology to her?

811
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,277
That was my apology, I mean
I think that she... she accepted.

812
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,109
Fuck!

813
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,833
- Shit! He's back.
- What?

814
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,513
He's back hang on.

815
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,639
Fuck!

816
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,630
Shit.

817
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,995
I'm more concerned with the guy
screaming in this apartment.

818
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,993
Do you see him?

819
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,437
- Just pick up the bag.
- OK, no, the bag has holes in it.

820
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,273
- I have to get him in the jar.
- He's more afraid of you.

821
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,830
- Go in there.
- Whoa. Put him in the thing.

822
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,073
- OK. I'm gonna throw this out.
- Okay go!

823
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,119
Before we get into this.
Why don't you just call the kids.

824
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,798
Please, Stephen made it very clear...
Listen to me.

825
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,999
He said. A minimum of two days right,
so I don't want to like...

826
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,357
That's why I'm here. I don't want to rack
my brain worrying about it hour by hour.

827
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,318
I know, but then I... Just so that
I could get it off my mind too,

828
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,152
just give them a call
and make sure that

829
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,754
their not still wondering around
the apartment, like awake.

830
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,353
- Alright.
- And lost.

831
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,317
Hey guys! It's me!

832
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,310
There's no doubt in my mind
that your asleep right now.

833
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,268
But on the off chance that you
woke up prematurely, here I am.

834
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,839
Pick up the phone.

835
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,719
If you hear my voice,
pick up the phone.

836
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,189
If you can hear me,
pick up the phone.

837
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,070
Come on guys.
Come on guys.

838
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,113
Alright I'm gonna count to three.

839
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,078
And I'm just going to assume
that you are asleep.

840
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,880
One one thousand,
pick up the phone.

841
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,477
Two one thousand.

842
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,477
Alright three one thousand,
alright I'm not far guys.

843
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,359
I'll keep checking in.
I love you. Bye.

844
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,712
But you were buying spray paint
and that was for work.

845
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,237
Yeah. I can put it on the tab and buy,
you know, an overload of an amount

846
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,119
and I can kind of sneak
in my own colors.

847
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,635
- For?
- I go bombing.

848
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,118
What does that mean?

849
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,670
Bombing. Like graffiti.
You know, like that primitive...

850
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,195
Really? Like, you write stuff
or you draw pictures?

851
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,796
- I write rambo. On Sundays.
- Rambo. You write that?

852
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,390
- I usually like to go on Sundays-
- Are there less cops maybe?

853
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,757
Yeah, well they have that T.N.T.
Tuesday night task-force.

854
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,275
Tuesdays and Thursdays
there are more cops on the street.

855
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,716
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's happening?

856
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,711
- Lenny.
- Hey. What's up, man?

857
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,030
- You mind if I join you guys?
- No.

858
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,476
Look, I don't wanna interrupt
I'm just totally listless.

859
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,598
I just wanna kill time. You know,
I don't wanna go home yet...

860
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,751
He's gonna tell us a story.
He's a graffiti artist.

861
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,399
I'm not sure
if I'm supposed to say that.

862
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,879
For Christ's sake.

863
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,189
- You can't even see it.
- C'mon. It's fuckin' cold, man.

864
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,108
Cut it out.

865
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,918
For cyrin' out loud.
Let me have this.

866
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,311
No oil here.
I don't know what that means.

867
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,239
It looks good, Lenny.
Way to lay it on thick, man.

868
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,231
Don't put my last name on there.

869
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,392
Lenny! Run! Lenny!
50. Run Lenny!

870
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,035
- Oh, fuck.
- NYPD, let me see your hands!

871
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,156
- Let me see your hands!
- Whoa, whoa, listen!

872
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,912
- Let me see your hands!
- I didn't do anything.

873
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,832
Up against the wall.
Let me see your hands.

874
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,878
- Hey! I'm not resisting.
- Let me see your hands.

875
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,112
- I didn't do anything!
- Stop movin'.

876
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,078
- First of all- - I don't wanna hear
your mouth! Stop movin'!

877
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,032
- I'm not resisting.
- What do you have on you?

878
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,873
Listen to me.
I was writing something nice.

879
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,397
- What'd you have on you back there!?
- Do I have anything on me? Alright.

880
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,430
I'm not resisting.
For the record, I'm not resisting!

881
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,319
Let's go.

882
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,675
Line up right over here by the window.
Back against the wall.

883
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,556
Back against the wall!

884
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,199
I'm tryin' to figure out
what needs to happen

885
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,316
before we can get back
out on the street.

886
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,236
- Well, Dad, we need to-
- Don't be a dick, alright?

887
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,392
We'll probably see a judge
in the next twenty-four hours,

888
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,993
- I'm assuming.
- It's gonna be a while.

889
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,993
Since it's the weekend we're definitely
gonna be in here a little longer.

890
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,754
I don't want the fuckin' sandwich!
Cut it out!

891
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:44,553
Leni. It's me.
This is a bonafide emergency.

892
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,153
So, I don't know where you are,

893
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,912
I don't know why you're
not picking up your phone.

894
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:54,030
That was my last quarter.
I'm kinda freakin' out.

895
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,796
I need you to please go up
to thirty-fifth street

896
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,951
and check on the kids
as soon as you get this.

897
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,157
I have to see a judge apparently and
that might happen at nine in the morning,

898
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,791
it might happen at eleven
in the morning... goodbye.

899
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,398
Anyone have another quarter?

900
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,996
Why don't you call collect?

901
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,037
- You want my sandwich?
- No. I'm good, thanks.

902
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,318
Hey buddies.

903
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,474
Dad, can you turn down the music?

904
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,320
Frey! Oh God!

905
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,234
Sage! You're awake!
Oh my God!

906
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,476
Listen, listen, we overslept,
we're late for school.

907
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,474
We have five minutes. We overslept.
It's my fault. It's my fault!

908
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,949
- This isn't the right way.
- Right way where?

909
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,109
To school.

910
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,032
Well guess what? That's 'cause
we're not going to school.

911
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,919
- Where are we going?
- C'mon, fuckers! Jump up.

912
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,114
Run!

913
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,950
- It seems to easy...
- Alright, go. I'll catch you.

914
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,549
You know what'll happen
if you fall over.

915
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,236
I'll race you down, Sage.
Ready, go.

916
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,678
Hey, hey.
Okay. C'mon guys.

917
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,631
C'mon, slowpoke.

918
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,511
- Daddy?
- What?

919
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,754
Get down.

920
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,757
C'mon, dad!

921
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,995
Frey, Frey, Frey come here.
Great. It's great. It's fortifying.

922
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,433
Stop, guys. C'mon.

923
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,114
I want you to appreciate
what you're seeing.

924
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,755
Isn't there something?
Give me one detail from each window

925
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,876
and then we can move on.
You each have to say one detail.

926
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,075
Realistic clouds.

927
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,913
Okay, good. Realistic clouds.
That's one. You?

928
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,314
- Red flowers.
- Okay, red flowers. That's good.

929
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,755
Okay, one detail out of each window
and then you're aloud to move on.

930
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,239
Beautiful background.

931
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,837
Beautiful background. Okay, that's
sorta generic, but it's passable.

932
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,355
It means, you know,
it's not the most colorful description.

933
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,271
What's happening, guys?

934
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,877
- Is that real?
- Yep.

935
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,349
You know I killed one just like this
in the bathroom the other day.

936
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,592
- Did it suck your blood?
- Actually, it didn't suck my blood

937
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,593
but I used one of your old
sweatshirts to sop it up.

938
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,555
- Was there a lot of blood?
- Oh, yeah.

939
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,474
- That would suck all of your blood out.
- There native to New York.

940
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,479
Yeah that would suck
all of your blood out.

941
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,629
Are those real?

942
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,837
Yeah, they breed in the sewers.
Nah, it's made out of wax I think.

943
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,518
They magnify it so you can see
all the details. That's incredible.

944
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,913
- Heads under.
- Daddy, you know that mosquito

945
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,436
you said you killed that
we saw in the museum?

946
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,670
I was kidding.
That was a joke.

947
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,229
Remember today you were making
all sorts of jokes.

948
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,198
Remember at the museum you said
I looked like the monkey.

949
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,079
- No.
- Well, I was joking too.

950
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,753
Yeah, but-

951
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,117
Mosquitoes do not exist at that size.

952
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,917
They don't exist in this apartment
at that size.

953
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,595
Only in the world of jokes
are there mosquitoes that big.

954
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,991
- Alright, guys, dunk your heads.
- But was it slimy?

955
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,628
Under, under, under.

956
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,556
C'mon, seriously guys dunk
your heads please.

957
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,517
- I did.
- I know you did.

958
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,910
Please. Take a page
from your brother's book.

959
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,358
- Mom's name is Paige.
- That's right. That's correct.

960
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,359
Alright,

961
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,357
you don't leave me any choice.

962
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,996
Dad, every time I close my eyes
I see the mosquito and you said

963
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,869
you'd turn on the lights,
so can you please turn on the lights?

964
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,992
It's just gonna make it
harder to fall asleep.

965
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,390
Can you please turn on the light,
I don't care.

966
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,118
- Yeah, can you turn on the light.
- Alright, alright.

967
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,556
I don't want the mosquito to come
and suck my blood out.

968
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,472
You realize, guys,
that mosquitoes are drawn to light.

969
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,154
So, if anything this is just
gonna make it scarier.

970
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,788
And harder for us to fall asleep.

971
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,273
'Night dad.
'Night dad, 'night Sage.

972
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,668
Alright, goodnight guys.

973
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,391
When are we gonna see you again?

974
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,959
Soon, very soon.

975
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,394
Five days?

976
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,636
- Well, not five days.
- I bet in a year.

977
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,434
- Less than a year.
- No.

978
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,751
- Yes, I mean.
- C'mon guys.

979
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,911
Yes we'll see in you
in less than a year.

980
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,832
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm late.

981
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,718
Hi, I love you guys.
I missed you.

982
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,872
Listen, I got movie tickets.
We gotta go.

983
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,395
- Alright, go to your mom.
- Let me get a taxi.

984
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,791
C'mon, go to your mother.
I know you guys don't wanna go, c'mon!

985
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,076
Run! I'm serious, you're late. Go.

986
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,229
- Here's a taxi, you guys!
- Seriously, no joke, it's time.

987
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,755
- They don't wanna leave.
- I got treats.

988
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,796
- Listen, say good bye to your dad.
- Bye, dad.

989
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,190
- Just wave to your father.
- Hey Frey, you know what?

990
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,828
That's what.

991
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,797
- Wave to your dad.
- The bag!

992
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,951
- The bag!
- Hey! Hey!

993
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,633
Sorry.

994
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,188
Hey, hey. What do we have?
Got some nice wood here.

995
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,828
- Look, you don't see this everyday.
- Dale, c'mon.

996
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,560
This is good.
I can do anything with this.

997
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,233
- Help me take it to the car.
- It's junk.

998
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,799
No, it's good,
I can do anything with it.

999
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,916
It's junk. Check it out.
It's cheap wood. You see that?

1000
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,073
- Relax, man. You're gonna ruin it.
- Ruin it? It's a piece of shit!

1001
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,913
Relax, man!

1002
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,519
Leni.

1003
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,152
I am not angry.
I am frustrated.

1004
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,195
And very confused.
I would like to just hear from you.

1005
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,148
If you would like me to stop
calling you I would like to know that.

1006
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,914
I keep saying, the kids are
not here anymore.

1007
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,640
I have the free space,

1008
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:04,476
I have the mental space
to be more considerate.

1009
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,595
I don't know.

1010
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,876
Please, just call me
and say hello

1011
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,032
or call me to tell me
to stop calling you.

1012
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,273
Fuck!

1013
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,153
Six-five.

1014
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:28,712
Hey! Hey! What the fuck
are you doing, man!? Hey!

1015
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,030
Hey, quick, you hear that?
Frey, Frey?

1016
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,909
Sage? Sage?

1017
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,552
Sage! What's shakin'?
What's happening, kiddo?

1018
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,152
Very good. Listen,
will you put your mom on?

1019
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,319
Will you put your mom on for me?

1020
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:27,792
Okay. Here she is.
It's dad.

1021
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,189
Lenny?

1022
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:37,598
Well, you know, it's six o'clock,
I'm making dinner. What's up?

1023
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,478
Do this part again.

1024
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,993
I've got Carmen coming tomorrow...

1025
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,993
No, no, but tomorrow is a half-day
and I've got plans to take the kids

1026
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,073
to see my folks this weekend. Okay?
So it's not gonna happen.

1027
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,358
It's a half day. Right.
And I have paid Carmen in advance.

1028
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,273
She's coming to get the kids
so it's not gonna work.

1029
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,274
I understand that you miss the kids,
that's great, but frankly,

1030
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,635
you're lucky you even see the kids.

1031
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,396
You are.
Because I hear the stories.

1032
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,358
You know, I could easily
get full custody with these kids.

1033
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,478
The stories that I've heard
with all your weirdo friends.

1034
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,599
These are little kids, it's completely
inappropriate what you do with them.

1035
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,512
I know you're the father,
but you know what?

1036
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,956
You're not a great father all the time.
And you certainly were not that great

1037
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,678
when you had them
for the last two weeks.

1038
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,798
It's not gonna happen, my food is
getting burnt and over done here,

1039
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,995
I've got to go.

1040
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,391
Okay, I'll see you.
No. Goodbye.

1041
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,954
Have you done anything?
No. You haven't done anything.

1042
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,636
This is homework that's due tomorrow.
You see? It's double sided, do it.

1043
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,270
Okay? Frey, we're gonna eat
in five minutes, okay?

1044
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,873
So just hang in there.

1045
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,952
Frey! Frey!

1046
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,275
Frey!

1047
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,714
Carmen! Como estas?

1048
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,036
- Como esta usted?
- Cuanto tiempo!

1049
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,155
Mucho tiempo.

1050
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,276
How you doin' buddy?
Surprise!

1051
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,908
- Hay una problemo.
- Si, que paso?

1052
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,074
Paige made a big mistake.
Change of plans.

1053
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,719
I am taking the boys,
I'm gonna give them

1054
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,836
a nice home-cooked meal today,
I'm gonna return them.

1055
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,797
- I'm worried-
- No, no, don't be worried.

1056
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,554
She gave me the money.
It was just a mistake. Please.

1057
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,711
You know I'm responsible for them.

1058
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,912
How you doin' buddy?
Where's your brother?

1059
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,354
- Be good with daddy.
- Say goodbye to Carmen.

1060
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,633
Alright, guys.

1061
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,878
Check it out.

1062
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,476
Alright we're almost ready
for the chicken, guys. Alright?

1063
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,636
I made a list. Where is it?

1064
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,031
We need some groceries.
Sage, come over here.

1065
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,031
- You're in charge.
- What are we having for dinner?

1066
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,236
- We're having Lenny surprise.
- Oh god.

1067
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,632
Chicken Lennini! Listen to me.
This is a grocery list.

1068
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,349
Read it back to me.

1069
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,718
Milk, cream, orange juice,
apple juice, peppercorn, salt-

1070
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,632
I don't want you going to the
Korean place on the corner, alright?

1071
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,439
- It's a rip-off.
- Where else would we go?

1072
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,989
...and you're gonna make a left,
then you're gonna make a right-

1073
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,833
this is how we save money-
then you're gonna make a right.

1074
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,597
You're gonna go to the big supermarket.
Alright? This is fifty-five dollars.

1075
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,954
- I'll take it.
- I got it.

1076
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,633
You're in charge of the money.

1077
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,837
You're in charge of picking out
the items. Teamwork, guys.

1078
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:06,670
Alright, go. Twenty-ninth street
and third avenue.

1079
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,989
Bye, dad.

1080
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,357
Frey, Frey!

1081
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,198
Look, fruit snacks.
They're my favorite.

1082
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:36,229
- They have real fruit in them.
- Toss 'em in, I guess.

1083
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,555
Rosemary, rosemary.
Crushed rosemary?

1084
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,154
- Crushed or leaves?
- Leaves.

1085
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,989
- Why leaves?
- It looks nicer.

1086
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,759
- Hey!
- Hey, dad!

1087
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,193
Quick! Catch it!
C'mon guys.

1088
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,028
- Come on in. Guys, come on in.
- What's happening?

1089
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,159
Listen to me, okay? Listen to me,
very carefully, alright?

1090
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,914
This is a surprise.
We are moving,

1091
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,548
we have ten minutes to bring
everything down to thirty-sixth street.

1092
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,233
- What do you mean we're moving!?
- Just what I said.

1093
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,436
We are moving
to a much bigger apartment.

1094
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,068
- What about the TV?
- What about the sofa?

1095
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,836
Listen to me!
We have ten minutes to go downstairs

1096
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,232
to a truck that is going to move us
to a bigger apartment, okay?

1097
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,435
I like this apartment!

1098
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,352
You are embarrassing me
in front of Mark.

1099
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,511
You are embarrassing yourselves
in front of Mark.

1100
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,395
Lenny, this is a really
weird situation.

1101
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,597
I gotta get out of here. Hey guys.
It's good to see you again.

1102
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,193
I knew you when you were this big

1103
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,157
and you when you were just
pretty much a thought.

1104
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,117
- Mark, ten minutes.
- No, I'm gone man.

1105
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,113
Listen guys, we'll catch up the next time
your dad's not moving.

1106
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,238
Mark, mark. Do not do this to me.
Please, do not do this to me.

1107
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,833
Ten more minutes!

1108
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,991
You're really gonna wanna
take your hand off. No more.

1109
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,833
- You've been a saint.
- Yeah, well. Later.

1110
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:32,756
Alright guys, change of plans.
We are down to three.

1111
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:37,198
I seriously need your cooperation.
We have to work as a team.

1112
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,033
- No!
- Pick up a box, hold a box.

1113
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,875
Hold this box, alright.

1114
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,479
I got all your toys in here, okay?

1115
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,679
We're only taking he essentials now
and guess what I considered an essential?

1116
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,319
The games.

1117
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,958
Give me a box.
Give me a box!

1118
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,677
What do you look so happy for?
I see you smiling.

1119
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,913
I see you smiling! C'mon.

1120
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,119
Alright guys.

1121
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,037
Hey, hey, hey.
Alright, thanks man.

1122
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,031
- What's with the fridge?
- I told you.

1123
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,997
- I'm moving everything, man.
- But what's with the fridge?

1124
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,071
You just told me you,
a couple boxes and that was it.

1125
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:38,234
Just open the back for me, alright?
Alright guys. Up and at 'em.

1126
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,073
And we're off.

1127
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,877
Will you please hold on?

1128
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,154
Thank you.

1129
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,510
This is pretty awesome, huh?

1130
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,518
Hey! Watch it!

1131
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,594
Hold on!
Will you hold on to the thing!

1132
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,597
Jesus Christ.
Hold on. I said hold on.

1133
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,273
I'm holding on!

1134
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,272
Will you watch your driving man,
I'm not kidding!

1135
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,277
That's it. You or anybody
does not tell me how to drive.

1136
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,510
Oh, come on man.
For cryin' out loud.

1137
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,716
- Get your stuff out.
- Listen to me, I apologize.

1138
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,030
- I got nothing to say.
- This is not a personal thing.

1139
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,236
The kids were bouncing
all over the place.

1140
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,436
- Get these things out.
- Oh, give me a fuckin break!

1141
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,109
You alright? You alright?

1142
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,559
Come on!

1143
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,749
Come on, guys!
Here, three please.

1144
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,597
- Frey, help!
- Just keep it.

1145
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,035
Could you open
the service door for me?

1146
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,879
Thank you.

1147
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,757
- I'm not going.
- Help. Help!

1148
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,717
I'm not going to.

1149
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,674
Sage!

1150
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,308
That's fine.
Here, this way.

1151
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,316
Forget it, just forget it.

1152
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,915
Get the boxes on.

1153
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,754
Frey, I need you
to cooperate right now.

1154
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,073
This is all gonna be over
in five minutes, okay?

1155
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,392
- No!
- C'mon, I'm not kidding.

1156
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,994
- Get off! - Goddamn it.
Alright, we're ready to go.

1157
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,479
Get off!

1158
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:21,675
Stop it. I'm not kidding.
Listen to me...

1159
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,635
Good afternoon,
if you’re standing,

1160
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,837
hold on please,
while the cabin’s in motion.
