April 20

2
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:14,955
Dear Daddy Longlegs,

3
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:18,891
Sometimes I worry that I'm not a genius.

4
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:23,068
This usually happens right after I've read a good book.

5
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:28,971
Will you be disappointed if I don't become a great author?

6
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:34,521
In the spring everything is so green and beautiful.

7
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:38,639
I feel like turning my back on school and playing outside.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,879
It's much more fun to live life than to write about it. I feel—

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,183
"Eek!" This letter has been interrupted by someone screaming—me!

10
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:57,649
Sallie immediately banged on my door. "Are you all right?"

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,114
"What's going on?" Julia cried.

12
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:04,485
"Why are you screaming?"

13
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:09,243
I opened my door and pointed to a centipede on my chair.

14
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:13,429
"That's why! It fell from the ceiling and landed next to me!"

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,934
Julia took a quick look and shuddered. "Ugh."

16
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:20,299
Then she went back to her room.

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,226
Thank goodness for Sallie, who stayed to help me.

18
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:33,326
She looked around my room and then grabbed my hairbrush. "Stand back!"

19
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:38,384
Sallie whacked the centipede with the back of the brush.

20
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:41,632
(I'll never be able to use that brush again!)

21
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:48,467
She killed the bug's front end, but its rear fifty feet ran under a chest of drawers.

22
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:53,525
"It escaped!" Sallie sounded disappointed that we hadn't caught it.

23
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:58,268
"This dorm is so old and full of centipedes."

24
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:59,721
"You did your best."

25
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:03,688
I picked up my cup, which I'd dropped in my rush to escape.

26
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,133
"I hate centipedes!

27
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:09,094
They're disgusting creatures.

28
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,268
I'd rather find a tiger under my bed!"

29
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:18,250
The centipede was only one of the annoying things that happened today.

30
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:23,237
I woke up late because I didn't hear the morning bell.

31
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:25,644
I broke a shoelace while getting dressed.

32
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,946
I was late for breakfast and my first class.

33
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:34,498
Then in math class, I had a little argument with the professor.

34
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:39,177
"I don't understand why my answer is wrong," I said.

35
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:44,254
"Because you've worked the problem incorrectly," she said.

36
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:47,333
"But this is how the textbook said to do it!"

37
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,186
I insisted that I was right.

38
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,943
"Look it up again," she said.

39
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:56,958
"Now, class, let's move on to the next problem."

40
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,301
When I looked in my textbook, I saw she was right. Of course.

41
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:06,459
On and on went the annoying things.

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,860
For lunch we had gray stew.

43
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:13,271
It reminded me of orphanage food.

44
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:18,513
In English the professor gave us an impossible poem to analyze.

45
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,817
No one knew what to write.

46
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,283
So we sat there in silence for 45 minutes.

47
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:31,565
Then it rained, and we couldn't play golf in gym class.

48
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:36,552
When I got home, my new spring dress had arrived.

49
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:41,475
But it was so tight that I couldn't sit down.

50
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:45,582
Oh, and the maid had cleaned my room while I was at classes.

51
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,950
She mixed up all my papers!

52
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:53,303
Supper was as delicious as lunch.

53
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:57,454
In other words, more orphanage food.

54
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:01,412
I was finally sitting down to read when someone knocked on my door.

55
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:05,665
It was a girl from Latin class.

56
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:11,349
"May I ask a quick question about the homework?" she said.

57
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:17,170
She stayed for an hour, talking about the most boring things.

58
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,024
After she left, I decided to write to you.

59
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:25,332
And that's when the centipede arrived.

60
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,216
So I've had a bad day.

61
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:30,971
Anybody can face a crisis.

62
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:35,138
But I think it's harder to deal with life's little annoyances.

63
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,319
That requires spirit.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,126
From now on, I'll try to be that kind of person.

65
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:46,261
You'll never hear me complain about Julia wearing silk stockings.

66
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:50,477
Or centipedes dropping in while I'm writing a letter.

67
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,721
Yours truly,

68
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,212

May 5

70
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:57,700
Dear Daddy Longlegs,

71
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:02,342
I just received a most disturbing letter from Mrs. Lippett.

72
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:06,448
She hopes I am behaving myself and doing well in my studies.

73
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,189
(That's not the disturbing part.)

74
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,839
She wants me to return to the orphanage this summer and work there.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,299
(That's the disturbing part.)

76
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,772
I can imagine what happened at this month's meeting of the trustees and ladies' committee.

77
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:26,769
Mrs. Lippett stood up and said, "Thank you all for coming today.

78
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,636
We must discuss Jerusha Abbott's future."

79
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:36,300
Then one of the trustees (maybe you?) said, "I thought that was settled.

80
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,936
She's studying to be a writer."

81
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,965
Mrs. Lippett looked very respectful.

82
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:46,065
"Yes, we did settle that part of her future, sir.

83
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:48,936
But I'm talking about this summer.

84
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,703
I assume she has no place to go.

85
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:55,475
She is, of course, an orphan."

86
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:58,792
Several of the ladies nodded in agreement.

87
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:05,850
"So I respectfully suggest that Jerusha be allowed to return here," Mrs. Lippett went on.

88
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:09,222
"There's plenty of work for her to do."

89
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:12,205
Did anyone speak up to defend me?

90
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:16,539
Did anyone ask what I thought of this idea?

91
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,841
Obviously not.

92
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:22,601
So I'll tell you what I think of Mrs. Lippett's proposal.

93
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:26,271
I HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME.

94
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,230
I would rather die than go back there!

95
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:31,420
Even for just a summer.

96
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:33,449
Yours most truthfully,

97
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,625
Jerusha Abbott
