(Shutter clicks )

4
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,169
This is Andy Barclay. Eight
years ago, he started the scandal

5
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:55,379
that nearly crippled this company,

6
00:03:55,421 --> 00:04:01,594
claiming his Good Guy doll Chucky
Was possessed by...Charles Lee Ray,

7
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:04,264
the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.

8
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,432
(Murmuring)

9
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,854
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:14,149
after all the lawsuits
and negative publicity,

11
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,693
When the company is finally
getting back on its feet again,

12
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:21,781
Where is the Wisdom in putting
the Good Guy back on the market?

13
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:25,701
Mr Sullivan,
before any of this happened,

14
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:29,163
the Good Guy outsold
all our other toys two to one.

15
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:32,625
Even now, interest in
the marketplace is at its peak.

16
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:37,172
The factory is running again.
We should be in stores by next Week.

17
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:42,177
We cannot let the fantasies
of one disturbed boy

18
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,303
influence company policy.

19
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:49,517
What if the doll somehow affects
another child in a negative Way?

20
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,687
You could have
a public relations nightmare.

21
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:57,067
You know, one of the hardest
things about this business

22
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:00,028
is that it is a business.

23
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,990
It doesn't matter What We're selling,

24
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:08,370
Whether it's cars, nuclear Weapons,
or, yes, even toys.

25
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,415
The bottom line is the bottom line.

26
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:16,879
And What are children, after all,
but consumer trainees?

27
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,173
(Chuckling)

28
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:22,091
Andy Barclay is ancient history.

29
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:27,764
No one remembers him. Nobody cares.

30
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:34,146
I have made up my mind.

31
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:36,189
We're moving ahead.

32
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,983
Thank you.

33
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,360
(Woman ) OK.
(Man ) All right.

34
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,362
Mr Sullivan.

35
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,324
If there's nothing I can say
to convince you,

36
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:49,119
then I must go on record With
my position: I'm against this.

37
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:52,456
Your position is
crystal clear, Miles,

38
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,750
and you can be sure I Won't forget.

39
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,045
Just a minute, folks!
We have a little surprise.

40
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:01,507
The guys at the factory
sent this over.

41
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:05,468
It's the first one :
the Good Guy of the 90's!

42
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,428
(Applause and cheers )

43
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:26,406
Well, if there's nothing else,
I'll get going.

44
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,535
Fine.

45
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:32,036
(Man ) It's just
my Wife's expecting me.

46
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,706
I  It's our anniversary.
I  Fine, Petzold.

47
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:40,170
Well, I guess I could review
the Larabie report after dinner.

48
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,589
I  Good night, Mr Sullivan.

I'm asking you.

116
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,695
I never felt comfortable
With those people.

117

They Weren't family,
they Were strangers.

I'm Willing to cut you slack

Thank you. I'm fine.

I'm Andy.

178
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:41,826
You must be new. Otherwise you'd know
there's no individuality here.

179
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,744
Certainly no first names.

Can't you read?
He Was supposed to get this package.

254
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:26,147
Tampering With the mail
is a federal offence.

255
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,233
Sorry. Is he your best friend?

256
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:34,698
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.

257
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:38,117
Wait a minute.

258
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:41,913
I got a new body,

Hey, Whitehurst.

265
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:47,770
Is there anything you can't do?

266
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:51,607
Yeah. I can't seem to get
thrown out of this place.

267
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,818
Barclay, meet De Silva.

268
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:56,654

No. Keep both eyes open.

274
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:37,278
Keep your sights on the target.

275
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:41,407
Now hold your breath.

276
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,951
SqueeZe the trigger,
don't pull it.

277
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:50,709
You're not concentrating.

278
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:57,590
It Was really great
What you did for us back there.

279
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,509
Shelton's a major dick.

Tell me about it.

281

(Tyler) Can't We play hide and seek?

282
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,773
(Chucky ) Hold still.

283
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:16,234
(Tyler) What do you call this game?

284
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:20,864
Hide the soul. Trust me.
You're gonna love it.

285
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:23,157
Whatever you say, Charles.

286
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:28,079

(Man ) Divide the troops in half.

293
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:53,063
Shit!

294
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,816
Charles, stop sWearing.

295
00:29:55,857 --> 00:30:00,362
Per soldier, We're gonna need
the Springfield OI 3s

296
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:03,699
marked for both the red team
and the blue team.

297
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,492
What are you doing, Tyler?

298
00:30:06,535 --> 00:30:08,452
We're playing hide the soul.

299

We don't play With dolls,

301
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:21,842
But Charles is my new best friend.

302
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:26,346
Tyler, you know better than to
talk back to a superior officer.

303

I  Yes, sir.

Barclay!

325
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:15,580
It's not a baton, Barclay.

326
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,461
You look like a goddamn
majorette over here.

327
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:27,384
I'm not used to guns, sir.

328
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:33,265
Does this look like
a gun to you, Barclay?

329
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:37,477
It's a rifle! Major Ellis?

330
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,855
Show the new boy the difference!

331
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:42,982
This is my rifle, this is my gun.

332
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:46,194
This is for shooting,
and this is for fun.

333
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:52,992
A soldier's rifle
is his best friend.

334
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:56,872
Remember that.

335
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:12,179
Stop!

336
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:17,808
Shit!

337
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:26,609
(Chucky ) Help! Please, mister!

338
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:28,612
Please, somebody!

339
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:32,031
I  Jesus!
I  (Chucky ) I'm stuck! Mister!

340
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,701
I'm in here!

341
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:37,871
(Man ) Hold on. I'm coming!

342
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:42,209
Where are you?

343
00:33:43,544 --> 00:33:45,420
I'm coming.

344
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:54,762
Yell or something! Make a noise!

345
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:03,896
Where are you?

346
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,944
What the...?

347
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:15,117
(Gasps )

348
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:18,911
Oh, my God.

349
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:20,706
No! Stop!

350
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,751
(Sinister laughter)

351
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,965
Stop! Ah!

352
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:33,010
Ahh!

353
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:37,222
(Screaming)

354
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:45,480
(Scream echoes )

355
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,608
(Shelton ) Fall out.

356
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:57,201
You get back there.

357
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,927
Better finish unpacking. Shelton's
notorious for surprise inspections.

358
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,932
What are you doing?

359
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:24,561
What does it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.

360
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:27,271
He makes you polish his shoes?

361
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:30,775
No, I offered out of
the kindness of my heart(!)

362
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:39,492
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane
With that doll today?

363
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,577
No. What doll?.

364
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,871
He Was carrying a Good Guy doll

365
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:47,000
just before the accident
With the garbage truck.

366
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,293
Good Guys, I remember those.

367
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:52,255
Yeah, me, too.

368
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:02,056
Uh, lights out in a few minutes.
I'm going to go get Washed up.

369
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:19,824
Barclay, Sergeant Clark Wondered
if you got that package.

370
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:22,577
I  What package?
I  You got a package in the mail.

371
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,789
Tyler Was bringing it.
Didn't you get it?

372
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:27,081
No.

373
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:32,336
Who sent me a package?

374
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,250
ow!

375
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:57,297
Hey, long time no see, pal.

376
00:37:57,338 --> 00:38:00,425
No, you're dead. We killed you!

377
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:05,847
You know What they say, you just
can't keep a Good Guy down.

378
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:08,349
(Laughing)

379
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:14,940
Andy, how you've grown.

380
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:18,402
You're not gonna kill me.
You need my body.

381
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:20,320
Wrong again, Wimp.

382
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:25,032
I got fresh meat lined up and you
Won't spoil it, not this time.

383
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,452
Tyler.

384
00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:31,998
Yeah, just think.
Chucky's gonna be a bro.

385
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,835
I'm not gonna let you
get away With this.

386
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:39,380
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.

387
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:45,762
(Chucky screaming)

388
00:38:57,023 --> 00:39:00,735
What's the matter, Barclay, huh?
You homesick?

389
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:02,862
You miss your mommy?

390
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,824
What the fuck is this?

391
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:09,244
Sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.

392
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:11,746
Just give me back the doll.

393
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:14,708
No, no, you listen to me.

394
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,210
You tell Whitehurst
he's off the hook.

395
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,505
I got myself another slave.

396
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,592
And clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.

397
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:26,512
What about the doll?.

398
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:32,016
My kid sister's birthday
is coming up.

399
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:34,769
I think she's gonna love it,
don't you?

400
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:01,106
(Door creaks )

401
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:06,903
(Rustling)

402
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:25,088
Oh, shit.

403
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,204
Andy.

404
00:41:58,664 --> 00:42:00,541
What the fuck?

405
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,295
No, stop!

406
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:07,172
What the fuck are you doing?

407
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:09,173
You Wouldn't believe me.

408
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,427
Where's the doll, Barclay?

409
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:16,306
Where's the fucking doll?.

410
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:18,057
I  You took it.
I  No!

411
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:20,184
What's going on?

412
00:42:20,226 --> 00:42:22,521
Somebody sure as hell took it.

413
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:39,496
It's almost midnight, Colonel.
Is this really necessary?

414
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:41,664
I'm Weeding out a thief, sir.

415
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:45,335
You've told me it's important
to uphold the honour code.

416
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:48,880
I'm trying to impress that
upon the men, sir.

417
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:53,467
All right, Shelton, make your point.

418
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,387
But I Want everybody back inside
at O1OO hours.

419
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:58,306
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:06,815
When We get through With Barclay,
he'll be living in a World of shit.

421
00:43:06,856 --> 00:43:09,525
We've got an hour
so let's make it count.

422
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:11,652
Yes, sir.

423
00:43:12,695 --> 00:43:15,782
(Ellis ) All right, ladies,
get those Weapons in the air.

424
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:17,867
I Want to see 'em high!

425
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:19,702
Higher!

426
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:23,039
I think I'm gonna throw up.

427
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:28,753
(Boy ) You're dead, new boy.
(Second boy ) Fucking geek.

428
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:03,914
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me, your best friend."

429
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,748
Shit.

430
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:16,050
(Tyler) Charles.

431
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:22,641
Come and find me!

432
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:25,518
God damn it.

433
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:27,396
I  Platoon!

434
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:28,688
Double time!

435
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,565
(Soldiers yell)

436
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:32,358
Get those knees up, ladies!

437
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,778
I  Where do the kids sleep?
I  Above the portico, Why?

438
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,615
(Ellis ) You're Wearing combat
boots, not ballet slippers.

439
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:42,286
I  Come on, move!
I  Barclay?

440
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:46,748
(Ellis ) It can get Worse than this!
Get the lead out. Move it!

441
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:51,128
Faster, faster. Let's go, girls.
Keep those knees in the sky!

442
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,467
You son of a bitch!

443
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:04,974
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.

444
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:07,311
Let's see What kind
of tough guy you are.

445
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,356
Get your head around.

446
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:20,740
(Giggles )

447
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:40,344
(Giggles )

448
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:53,690
Tyler, come out, come out,
Wherever you are!

449
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:59,737

450
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,032
