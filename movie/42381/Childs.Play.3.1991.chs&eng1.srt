00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,709
这是这是安迪・巴克利
This is Andy Barclay.

4
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,996
八年前，他引发的一起事件
Eight years ago,he touched off the scandal

5
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,911
差点使公司倒闭

6
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,069
声称他的好家伙玩偶，恰吉

7
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,153
被查尔斯・李・雷附身

8
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,954
一个声名狼藉的湖畔杀人犯

9
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,516
征求意见，女士们和先生们
Now I ask you,ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,757
在所有的诉讼和负面言论之后
after all the lawsuits and negative publicity,

11
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,588
公司最终决定恢复生产这个“好家伙”
when the company is finally getting back on its feet again,

12
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,514
讨论一下此产品推回到市场有何明智之举？
where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?

13
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,310
沙利文先生，在事件发生之前
Mr. Sullivan,before any of this happened,

14
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,995
“好家伙”娃娃的销量是其他娃娃的两倍
the Good Guy outsold all our other toys 2-to-I.

15
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,230
即使现在，市场的需求兴趣点也是在最巅峰

工厂已经进入再次量产阶段
The factory is up and running again.

17
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,952
在下周之前产品应进入各大商店
We should be in stores by next week.

18
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,716
我们不能让一个有“恐慌症”的孩子
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy

19
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,951
来影响了公司的效益
influence company policy.

20
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,077
还有，如果这种娃娃以消极的方式
Well, what if the doll somehow affects

21
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,190
影响了其他的孩子
another child in a negative way?

22
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,476
在你心里可能就会有一种无法摆脱的公共梦魇
You could have a public relations nightmare on your hands.

23
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,951
你们知道，这笔生意最难过的坎
You know, one of the hardest things about this business

24
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,031
就是这是一笔生意
is that it is a business.

25
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,519
我们卖什么并不重要
It doesn’t matter what we’re selling.

26
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,038
无论是汽车，核武器，甚至是玩具
Whether it’s cars,nuclear weapons, or, yes, even toys.

27
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,755
问题的关键在于
The bottom line is the bottom line.

28
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,233
孩子们算什么，毕竟，还是新生消费者
And what are children,after all,but consumer trainees

29
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,028
安迪・巴克利已经成为历史
Andy Barclay is ancient history.

30
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,274
没人记得他，没人关注他
No one remembers him. Nobody cares.

31
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,951
我已经决定
I have made up my mind.

32
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,031
要继续向前发展
We’re moving ahead.

33
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,478
谢谢大家
Thank you.

36
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,077
若没之前的事，我会全力支持你
If there’s nothing I can say to convince you,

37
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,911
但是我现在必须要表明我的立场
then I must go on record with my position.

38
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,591
我非常反对这样做
I’m completely against this.

39
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,992
你的立场已经很清楚了，迈尔斯

40
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,389
你也知道我也不会忘记历史的

41
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,038
朋友们，稍等一下

沙利文先生，有个小惊喜

工厂那边送来的
The guys at the factory sent this over.

44
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,675
我们都希望你会收下它

45
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,192
这是第一个下线的产品

90年代的“好家伙”

47
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,833
好吧，如果没事了，我要撤了

48
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,228

今天是结婚周年日

51
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,708
走吧，佩佐德

52
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,918
我想，晚餐之后重新仔细研究下市场调研报告

53
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,711

尽管股市趋势疲软

强于预期的就业报告

60
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,196
而且使部分个股出现技术性反弹

空头回补，持续买进

注意口令，巴克利，起立！
Look alive,Barclay, on your feet!

135
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,389
在肯特军校，我们接收尿床的蠢蛋，然后把他们变成男人
At Kent, we take bedwetters and turn them into men.

136
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,475
哦，不错，不错！
Oh, yes. Yes.

137
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,551
真不错！
Oh, yes!

138
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,711
我们都能看到头皮了，是吧？
We’re seeing some skin now, aren’t we?

139
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,438
滚吧！剪成光头了
Presto! You’re bald.

140
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,791
一开始总会感觉有点怪异
Always feels a little weird at first.

141
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,269
下一位
Next.

142
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,798
和它吻别吧
Kiss it goodbye.

143
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,317
知道吧，罗马人发明的大兵头
You know, the Romans invented the military cut.

144
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,709
知道为什么吗？
You know why?

145
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,954
为什么？
Why?

146
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,076
把头发剪短了
To keep their hair short

147
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,789
那在战争中敌人就无法抓头
so their enemies couldn’t grab ahold of it in battle

148
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,277
然后也无法割喉
and slit their throat.

149
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,991
现在，坐稳了
Now, hold still.

150
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,749
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

151
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,549
我们又回来了，我们比以往更卡哇伊了
We’re back,and we’re better than ever.

152
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,830
没人愿意和我玩
No one will play with me.

153
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,994
哦-哦，有一位孤单的小伙伴
Uh-oh.There’s a friend in need.

154
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,999
嘿，振作点
Hey, cheer up!

155
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,347
你是谁？
Who are you?

156
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,588
我是好家伙
I’m a Good Guy.

157
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,393
好家伙，好家伙，好家伙，好家伙！
Good Guy! Good Guy! Good Guy! Good Guy!

158
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,394
我刚刚从好家伙之家赶来
I’ve just come from the Good Guy Clubhouse,

159
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,231
我将永远成为你的小伙伴
and I’ll be your friend till the end.

160
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,548
做我小伙伴？
You will?

161
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,318
哇哦！
Wow!

162
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,798
当然
Sure I will.

163
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,028
嘿-N-吼
Hidey-h o!

164
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,750
来吧，和我一起尽享高飞的乐趣吧，永远做你的小伙伴
So, all aboard for high-flying fun with me,your friend till the end,

165
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,912
我是来自“玩偶伙伴”的“好家伙”
the Good Guy doll from Play Pals.

166
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,113
得了吧，哥们
Come on, man!

167
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,519
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

168
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,590
杂碎们，狗杂碎们！
The bastards! Fucking bastards!

169
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,714
咋回事？
What happened?

170
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,868
谢尔顿，就是那帮狗杂碎
Shelton,that’s what happened.

171
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,315
谢尔顿和他的潘啃∴们
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.

172
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,112
谢了，我没事
Thank you. I’m fine.

173
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,713
我叫安迪
I’m Andy.

174
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,919
你一定是新来的
You must be new.

175
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,877
不然你不会不知道这里的规矩
Otherwise you’d know they don’t tolerate any form of individuality here.

176
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,871
名字中“名”全部都是公开的
Certainly nothing so personal as the first name.

177
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,234
啊，对，我忘了，我姓巴克利
Yeah, right, I forgot.Barclay.

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,076

179
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,030
那，谢尔顿是谁？
So, who’s this Shelton?

180
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,200
军校助理，布雷特・C・谢尔顿上校
Cadet Lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.

181
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,038
这里他就是上帝
He’s God around here.

182
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,429
不要幻想他会仁慈
Don’t expect any mercy from him.

183
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,551
欢迎来到地狱，巴克利
Welcome to hell, Barclay.

184
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,479
全体集合完毕，长官
All present and accounted for, sir.

185
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,471
稍息，埃尔斯少校
Thank you, Major Ellis.

186
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,148
你新来的，是吧？
You’re the new boy, huh?

187
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,868
是
Yeah.

188
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,478
感觉咋样？
How you doing?

189
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,919
- 非常好 - 那就好
- Pretty good. - Good.

190
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,714
谁说了你可以向我直视的？
Who said you could look at me?

191
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,910
知道我是谁么？
Do you know who I am?

192
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,115
谢尔顿？
Shelton?

193
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,952
对你来说是军校助理谢尔顿上校，混蛋！
That’s Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!

194
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,791
军校助理谢尔顿上校
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.

195
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,031
不对，是“军校助理谢尔顿上校”
No. Lieutenant Colonel Shelton,

196
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,555
“长官”

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,996
军校助理谢尔顿上校，长官
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.

198
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,712
叫啥名，傻瓜？
What’s your name,dipweed?

199
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,433
巴克利
Barclay.

200
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,798
- 长官 - 大声点

201
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,914
- 长官 - 再大声点

这才像点样，新来的，这才像点样
That’s much better, new boy.That’s much better.

205
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,311
妈的，怀特・赫斯特
Shit, Whitehurst.

206
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,230
你们不用怀疑
You are without a doubt

207
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,074
这是我见过最悲哀的事
the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!

208
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,798
你们同意不？
Wouldn’t you agree?

209
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,032
我问你话呢，小子
I asked you a nimrod! question,

210
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,316
不，长官，我不同意，长官
No, sir! I don’t agree, sir!

211
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,631
你在反驳我吧，认为我是在胡扯吗？
Are you contradicting me,you sorry-ass sack of shit?

212
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,148
去你妈的
You asshole.

213
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,548
你刚说什么？
What did you say?

214
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,595
我刚说“去你妈的”，长官！
I said,“You asshole,” sir!

215
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,915
你以为你挺搞笑的，是吧，德・斯尔娃？
You think you’re pretty funny,don’t you, De Silva?

216
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,231
是，挺搞笑，长官
Yes, I do, sir.

217
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,353
那你现在何不赶紧趴下做25个？
Why don’t you drop and give me 25 right now?

218
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,112
25个啥，长官？

一个，长官，两个，长官...
One, sir. Two, sir...

221
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,037
现在，你们女生可能以为....
Now, you women might think that

222
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,429
你们比其他人更加脆弱
because you’re so much more delicate,

223
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,353
你们就该受到一些优待
you deserve some sort of special treatment,

224
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,993
但是我们只有一个月，你们必须抛弃那些鬼想法
and once a month we’re just going to get on out of your way.

225
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,832

每人都要遵守同一篇规章制度

抱歉，今天没你爸爸的信，明天来吧
Sorry. Nothing from your dad today.Maybe tomorrow.

237
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,069
听着，他忙着开战斗机，保卫国家
Listen,he’s busy flying jets,defending the country.

238
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,351
他一有机会就会写信给你的
He’ll write to you when he gets the chance.

239
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,509
我知道
I know.

240
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,788

Would you give this to the new kid for me? Barclay.

243
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,038
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

244
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,114
好孩子
Attaboy.

245
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,075
哇喔
Whoa.

246
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,438
看着点，小子！算了，你怎么能这么笨？
Watch it, kid! Anyway, how could you be so stupid?

247
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,192
嘿，看着点
Hey, look out!

248
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:43,192
军械库

249
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,153
好家伙娃娃
A Good Guy.

250
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,193
你他妈的是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

251
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,758
我以为你们只会说三句话呢
I thought you guys only said three sentences.

我是最新改良升级版的
I’m new and improved.

253
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,074
我以前从没看过像你这样的娃娃
I never saw a doll like you before.

254
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,117
好吧，孩子，不开玩笑了
All right, kid,fun’s over.

255
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,516
他妈的安迪在哪？
Where the hell’s Andy?

256
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,674
安迪？
Andy?

257
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,679
你不认字么？
Can’t you read?

258
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,672
这件包裹是寄给他的
He was supposed to get this package.

259
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,637
偷拆邮件可是大罪哦

260
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,836
抱歉，他是你的好基友么？

He’s more than that.He’s my new lease on life.

262
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,635

这有现成的新身体
I got a new body,

264
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,315
和他移魂之后不说出我的秘密就行了
and I ain’t told anyone about my little secret yet.

265
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:13,269
你叫啥名，孩子？
So, what’s your name, kid?

266
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,757
泰勒，你的呢？
Tyler. What’s yours?

267
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,189
恰吉，但是

268
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,557
我的真名叫查尔斯・李・雷

269
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,878
(GUNS FIRING)

270
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,951
怀特・赫斯特，我总是打偏！
Whitehurst,what am I doing wrong?

271
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,478
还有什么你办不到的么？
Is there anything you can’t do?

272
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,519
有啊，看起来我离不开这里了
Yeah. I can’t seem to get thrown out of this place.

273
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,797
巴克利，见过德・斯尔娃了
Barclay,meet De Silva.

274
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,751
嘿
Hi.

275
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,270
嗯，能指导指导我么？
So, want to show me?

276
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,557
- 当然，可以！ - 谢谢！
- Yeah, sure. - Okay.

277
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,557
不，肘部放低....对，就这样
No. Put the elbow...Yeah, like that.

278
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,118
然后这样
And like this.

279
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,155
不，两只眼睛都睁开
No. Keep both eyes open.

280
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,994
视线要盯住目标
Keep your sights on the target.

281
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,631
稳住呼吸
Now hold your breath.

282
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,834
扣紧扳机，不要太紧了
Squeeze the trigger,don’t pull it.

283
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,351
你很不专心
You’re not concentrating.

284
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,432
知道吗，在集合时你为我们所做的，真的是棒极了
You know, it was really great what you did for us back there at formation.

285
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,669
是的，谢尔顿就是个二逼
Well,Shelton’s a major dick.

286
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,796
给我讲讲他的事
Tell me about it.

287
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,119
我们就玩捉迷藏行么？
Couldn’t we just play hide-and-seek?

288
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,675
淡定哦
Hold still.

289
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,875
随便了，你怎么叫这个游戏？
What do you call this game anyway?

290
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,596
“灵魂隐匿”  相信我，你会喜欢的
Hide the Soul. Trust me.You’re gonna love it.

291
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,671
随你怎么说吧，查尔斯
Whatever you say,Charles.

292
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,869
（喃嘛呢叭咪耍喃嘛呢叭咪耍

293
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,198
我祈求你，赐予我力量吧！
Give me the power,I beg of you!

294
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,316
（喃嘛呢叭咪耍喃嘛呢叭咪耍

295
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,234
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

296
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,469
我们将队伍整体分成两队
So we divide the troops in half,

297
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,231
- 每一队大约是70人 - 妈的
- thaVll be about 70 on each team. - Shit!

298
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,550
查尔斯，停止宣誓
Charles, stop swearing.

299
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,630
每位队员，我们都需要
Per soldier,and we’re gonna need

300
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,994
配备一支装填0-3爆花弹的...是的，长官
the Springfield O-3s...Yes, sir.

301
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,196
然后将两队分别标记为红队和蓝队
marked for both the red team and the blue team.

302
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,073
你干嘛呢，泰勒？
What are you doing,Tyler?

303
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,999
我们在玩“灵魂隐匿”
We’re playing Hide the Soul.

304
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,314
我等会去找你
I’ll catch up with you.

305
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,913
我先去装颜料
I’ll start loading the paint pellet.

306
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,230
不要玩娃娃，好不，泰勒？
We don’t play with dolls,do we  now, Tyler?

307
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,196
女孩才玩娃娃的
Dolls are for girls.

308
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,435
但是查尔斯是我的新基友
But Charles is my new best friend.

309
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,916
泰勒，不要和高级长官顶嘴
Tyler, you know better than to talk back to a superior officer.

310
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,788
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

311
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,868
把这弄干净
Clean that up.

312
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,998
娃娃交给我
I’ll take care of this.

313
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,193
我会回来的！

(GARBLED COMMANDS)

332
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,074
巴克利！
Barclay!

333
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,109
这可不是棍子，巴克利
It’s not a baton,Barclay.

334
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,152
你他妈的看起来就像个乐队指挥
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.

335
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,991
我还不习惯用枪，长官
I’m not used to guns, sir.

336
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,553
在你看来这像是一把枪么，巴克利？
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?

337
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,878
这是把步枪
It’s a rifle!

338
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,878
- 埃尔斯少校？- 长官
- Major Ellis? - Sir!

339
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,076
给新兵蛋子看看枪和步枪的区别
Would you please show the new boy the difference?

340
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,550
这是我的步枪，这是我的枪
This is my rifle,this is my gun.

341
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,712
这个是用来射杀的，这个是娱乐的
This is for shooting,and this is for fun.

342
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,470
枪是士兵的最好的基友
A soldier’s rifle is his best friend.

343
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,834
记住
Remember that.

344
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,912
停
Stop!

345
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,597
妈的
Shit!

346
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,233
救命！求你了，先生！
Help!Please, mister!

347
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,317
救命啊，来人啊
Please, somebody!

348
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,627
天啊
Jesus!

349
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,756
我被卡住了，先生
I’m stuck，Mister!

350
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,598
我在车斗里
I’m in here!

351
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,316
坚持住，我来了
Hold on. I’m coming!

352
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,318
你在哪了？
Where are you?

353
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,913
我来了
I’m coming.

354
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,436
叫喊一下！弄点声音
Yell or something!Make a noise!

355
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,913
你在哪？
Where are you?

356
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,467
你他妈....
What the...

357
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,478
哦，天啊
Oh, my God.

358
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,592
不！停下！
No! Stop!

359
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,514
停下
Stop!

360
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,672
解散
Fall out.

361
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,679
去后面看看
You get back there.

362
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,277
最好把包裹打包好，巴克利
Better finish unpacking,Barclay.

363
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,277
谢尔顿的突然“紧急集合”是出名的
Shelton’s notorious for surprise inspections.

364
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,478
你在干嘛了？
What are you doing?

365
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,916
我像在干嘛？在给谢尔顿的鞋子上光
What does it look like? I’m polishing Shelton’s shoes.

366
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,871
他让你给鞋子上光？
He makes you polish his shoes?

367
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:51,237
不，我是良心发现，发发善心
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.

368
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,994
怀特・赫斯特，你看到科克伦今天和那个娃娃了吗？
Whitehurst,did you see Cochrane
with that doll today?

369
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,639
没，什么娃娃？
No. What doll?

370
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,594
他拿着一个好家伙娃娃
He was carrying a Good Guy doll,

371
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,478
就在垃圾车出事之前
just before the accident with the garbage truck.

372
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,750
好家伙，我想起来了
Good Guys,I remember those.

373
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,672
是的，我也是
Yeah, me, too.

374
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,474
呃，马上熄灯了
Uh, lights out in a few inutes.

375
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,750
我要去洗漱一下
I’m going to go get washed up.

376
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,398
巴克利，我差点忘了
Barclay,I almost forgot.

377
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,311
克拉克军士想知道你收到了包裹没
Sergeant Clark wanted to know if you got that package.

378
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,675
什么包裹？
What package?

379
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,199
他说那个泰勒小孩
He said you got a package in the mail.

380
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,829
应该给你一个被邮寄过来的包裹
That little kid Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.

381
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,637
- 难道你没收到？- 没收到
- Didn’t you get it? - No.

382
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,110
谁会给我邮寄包裹呢？
Who would’ve sent me a package?

383
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,755
嘿，好久不见，哥们
Hey,long time no see, pal.

384
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,190
不，你早死了，我们杀死你了
No, you’re dead. We killed you!

385
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,152
你知道他们说的
You know what they say,

386
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,516
你不会让好家伙停产滞销的
you just can’t keep a Good Guy down.

387
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,398
安迪，你都长大了
Andy, how you’ve grown.

388
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,438
你不能杀我的，你需要我
You’re not gonna kill me. You need me.

389
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,918
你需要向我的身体里移魂
You need to transfer your soul into my body.

390
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,797
又错了，胆小鬼
Wrong again, wimp.

391
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,074
计划中我有新选择了
I got some fresh meat lined up

392
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,548
我不会让你毁掉计划的，这次不行
and I’m not gonna let you spoil it, not this time.

393
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,996
泰勒
Tyler.

394
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,949
是，想想吧，恰吉将会是好基友
Yeah, just think. Chucky’s gonna be a bro.

395
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,431
我不会让你成功的
I’m not gonna let you get away with this.

396
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,039
我不会让你靠近那孩子的
I’m not gonna let you near that kid.

397
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:20,711
怎么了，巴克利，想家了？
What’s the matter,Barclay, huh? You homesick?

398
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,436
想你老妈了？
You miss your mommy?

399
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,878
这他妈怎么个事？
What the fuck is this?

400
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,791
真对不起，我错了，我会擦亮的
I’m sorry about your shoe, all right. I’ll polish it.

401
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,949
就是，求你把娃娃还我
Just give me back the doll.

402
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,510
不，不行，给我听着
No, no, you listen to me.

403
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,795
你告诉怀特・赫斯特他解脱了，懂没？
You tell Whitehurst he’s off the hook, huh?

404
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,949
我会另找苦工的
I got myself another slave.

405
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,155
把这一堆收拾干净，你会被记五次大过的
And clean up this mess.You got five demerits.

406
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,108
那娃娃呢？
What about the doll?

407
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,958
哦，我妹的生日要到了
Ah. My kid sister’s birthday is coming up.

408
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,199
我想她会喜欢的，你说呢？
I think she’s gonna love it,don’t you?
478
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,068
哦，妈的
Oh, shit.

409
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,108
安迪
Andy.

410
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,793
怎么个率拢
What the fuck?

411
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,032
不要，停下
No, stop!

412
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,838
你在我房间干他妈啥呢，巴克利？
What the fuck are you doing in my room, Barclay?

413
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,353
你不会相信我的
You wouldn’t believe me.

414
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,596
娃娃呢，巴克利？
Where’s the doll, Barclay?

415
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,951
他妈的娃娃哪去了？
Where’s the fucking doll?

416
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,478
- 你偷走了，是不？ - 不是
- You took it,didn’t you? - No!

417
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,675
怎么回事？
What’s going on?

418
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,157
是的，肯定有人偷走了
Yeah, well, somebody sure as hell took it.

419
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,713
马上就子夜了，上校
It’s almost midnight,Colonel.

420
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,831
真的有这个必要么？
Is this really necessary?

421
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:02,150
我正在搜查一个小偷，长官
I’m trying to weed out a thief, sir.

422
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,438
你总是一再告诫我
You’ve always told me how important it is

423
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,668
维持学校荣誉的重要性
to uphold the school’s code of honor.

424
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,909
我就是要让他们吃住这个教训，长官
I’m simply trying to impress that upon the men, sir.

425
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,911
好吧，谢尔顿，继续坚持吧
All right, Shelton, make your point.

426
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,911
但是凌晨一点前必须回去
But I want everybody back inside at 0100 hours.

427
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,273
是，长官
Yes, sir.

428
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,432
在我们搞定巴克利之前
By the time we get through with Barclay,

429
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,637
我会让他过着生不如屎的生活
he’s going to be living in a whole world full of shit.

430
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:30,108
好吧，还剩下一小时了，开始计时吧
All right.We’ve only got an hour,so let’s make it count.

431
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:31,474
是的长官
Yes, sir.

432
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,277
好了，女士们，举起武器
All right, ladies,get those weapons in the air.

433
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,952
我想看到枪被举高了
I want to see ‘em high!

434
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:39,833
在高点
Higher!

435
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,429
我想我快吐了
I think I’m gonna throw up.

436
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,958
你死定了，新兵蛋子
You’re dead, new boy.

437
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,188
去你妈的
Fucking geek.

438
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,277
“亲爱的查尔斯，你看到留言了”
“Dear Charles, you’re it.

439
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,396
“来找我吧，你的好朋友，泰勒”
“Come and find me,your best friend.”

440
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,309
妈的
Shit.

441
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,592
查尔斯
Charles.

442
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,956
来找我吧
Come and find me!

443
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,916
他妈的
God damn it.

444
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:48,155
- 前进   - 进攻
- Platoon! - Hut!

445
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,275
在来一次
Double time!

446
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,434
进攻
Hut!

447
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,918
膝盖抬起来，女士们
Get those knees up,ladies!

448
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,318
怀特・赫斯特，孩子们在哪睡觉？
Whitehurst,where do the kids sleep?

449
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,038
在门廊上面，怎么了？
Above the portico. Why?

450
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,679
你们穿的是军靴，不是芭比舞鞋
You’re wearing combat boots,not ballet slippers.

451
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,315
- 快，快！- 巴克利？
- Come on, move! - Barclay?

452
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,871
战场上永远都比这残酷
It’s gonna get a lot worse than this!

453
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,315
用力向前，快，快！
Get the lead out. Come on, move it!

454
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:09,710
快点，快点，布鲁克，快点！
Faster, faster.Let’s go, B rock!

455
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,869
膝盖在抬高点，快
Get those knees in the sky! Come on!

456
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,152
你他妈的
You son of a bitch!

457
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,597
你他妈的摊上大事了，巴克利
You got a hell of a punch there, Barclay.

458
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,871
让我看看你骨头到底有多硬
Now I’ll see what kind of tough guy you really are.

459
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,590
把头抬起来
Get your head around.

460
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,349
泰勒，出来，出来，你在哪呢？
Tyler, come out, come out,wherever you are.

461
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,710
抓到你了哦！
Oily oiiy oxen free.

462
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,597
赶紧出来你这个小混蛋
Get out here,you little son of a bitch.

463
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:36,072
- 三 - 三
- Three! - Three!

464
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,559
还是不够狠
You’re not sounding off.

465
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:38,628
四
Four!

466
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:39,789
真他妈的让我恼火
You’re pissing me off!

467
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,914
五
Five!

468
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,717
我服了，巴克利，你可真让我服了
All right, Barclay,you got me curious.

469
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,038
你到底想要证明什么？
What are you trying to prove?

470
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,518
算了，别提了
Forget it.

471
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,552
不，真的，我想知道
No, really, I want to know.

472
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,588
好吧
All right.

473
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,916
那个娃娃是活的，它正找泰勒呢
The doll’s alive.He’s after Tyler.

474
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,349
你是对的，算了，忘了吧
You’re right,forget it.

475
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,954
祈祷泰勒能自己搞定吧
I just hope he can take care of himself.

476
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,949
- 这边 - 好，好的
- Come on. - Okay, okay.

477
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:01,836
小点声
Quiet.

478
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,199
别出声
Shut up.

479
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,838
好的，来吧
Okay, come on.

480
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,467
来啊
Come on.

481
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,871
真不敢相信我能带你一起来干这个
I can’t believe I let you talk me into this.

482
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,076
好了，呆在这帮我把风
Okay, just stay here and keep an eye out,okay?

483
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:20,148
好，我最擅长把风的
Oh, I live for this.

484
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,797
我知道，伊芙，好了，去吧，去吧
I know, Ivers.Now, go, go!

485
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,909
知道吗，我真不知道那小子有啥特别的，真的
You know, I don’t see what you see in that guy, anyway.

486
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,389
我也不知道，他就是....就是有点特别
I don’t know, he’s...Well, he’s just different from everybody else.

487
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,514
哦，拉倒吧
Oh, please.

488
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:39,588
哦，他还有一点可爱
Oh, he’s kind of cute, too.

489
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:41,159
呵呵
Mmm.

490
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,954
好了
Okay.

491
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:48,356
寄养家庭，难怪这么内向
Foster homes. No wonder he’s so quiet.

492
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,958
什么声音
What was that?

493
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,353
是你偷走了娃娃
So you took the doll?

494
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,873
谢尔顿要是知道你会上军事法庭的
Shelton will have you court-martialed if he finds out.

495
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,268
我们在玩捉迷藏，你们在干嘛？
We’re playing Hide and Seek.What are you guys doing?

496
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,554
我们睡不着
We couldn’t sleep.

497
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:25,711
啊，它太可爱了
Oh, he is so cute.

498
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,076
伊芙，我先找到它的，还给我，还给我
Ivers, he was mine first!Give him back! Give him back!

499
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,277
你们这些家伙，能安静点不？
You guys,please be quiet.

500
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,509
你去站岗把风
Can you go stand guard?

501
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,873
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

502
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,278
它叫啥名？
So what’s his name?

503
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,237
- 你自己问它 - 好吧
- Ask him yourself - All right.

504
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,157
你叫啥名，小娃娃？
What is your name,little doll?

505
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,150
嘿，我是恰吉，你一生相伴的好基友
Hi, I’m Chucky.And I’m your friend to the end.

506
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,271
嘿-N-吼
Hidey-ho!

507
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:51,351
爱死它了
I love it.

508
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,351
他的真名叫查尔斯・李・雷
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.

509
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,914
哦，是吗？口红给我
Oh, is that so? Give me your lipstick.

510
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,478
- 干嘛？ - 给我吧
- What for? - Just give it to me.

511
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,913
哦，给
Oh, here.

512
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,713
你做什么呢？
What are you doing?

513
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,159
瞧着吧
You’ll see.

514
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,514
等等，停下来
Wait. Stop.

515
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,512
- 怎么样，小宝贝！ - 别这样
- Here you go,little baby! - Come on!

516
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,715
你会把它弄脏的
You’re messing him up.

517
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,914
哦，你太可爱了
Oh, you’re so cute.

518
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,637
- 别那么做 - 啊哦
- Don’t do that! - Aw.

519
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,472
不要，它看起来太傻了
Don’t. He looks stupid.

520
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,597
你把他弄的和傻瓜一样
You’re making him look like a wuss.

521
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:15,398
天啊，看起来太美了，你干嘛呢？
No, he looks sweet.What are you doing?

522
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,356
注意点，有人来了
You guys, someone’s coming.

523
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,875
好了，赶紧撤
Come on, let’s go.

524
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,233
快，快撤，等等，等等
Come on. Let’s go.Wait, wait.

525
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,753
等会，查尔斯怎么办？
Stop! What about Charles?

526
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,112
这简直是宣战
This means war.

527
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:39,639
这怎么回事？
What the hell?

528
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,916
我喜欢被拥抱
I like to be hugged.

529
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,958
哦，你他妈的不是在耍我吧？
Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me!

530
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:12,630
这家伙今晚还来回巡逻了两次
A man lives through two tours in Nam

531
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,393
然后现在就突然挂了
and then one night he just drops dead.

532
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,670
没有任何征兆
Doesn’t make any sense.

533
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:32,791
跨立！
At ease!

534
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:35,237
谨此
We will now take a moment of silence

535
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,594
向科克伦上尉默哀
to honor Colonel Cochrane.

536
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,717
他生前如此和蔼，我们将终生怀念
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.

537
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,516
低头默哀
Bow your heads for prayer.

538
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,916
就坐
Take seats!

539
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,351
卡尔森，头发越来越长了
It’s getting pretty shaggy, Carison.

540
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,838
下周五过来
I want to see you on Friday.

541
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,239
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

542
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,313
周一，卷毛小子
Monday, Fabrizzio.

543
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,117
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

544
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,514
乖孩子
My man.

545
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,956
周二
Tuesday.

546
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,311
瞅瞅你，怀特・赫斯特，你真他妈的丢脸
Look at you, Whitehurst.You’re a disgrace.

547
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,556
上次剪头是什么时候？
When’s the last time you had a trim?

548
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:41,197
差不多两周前，长官
Two weeks ago,Sergeant, I think.

549
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,554
差不多？差不多？
You think? You think?

550
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:44,835
吃完早餐立刻去见我 明白不？
I want to see you right after breakfast. You got it?

551
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,036
是的，波尼克军士，长官
Yes, sir,Sergeant Botnick, sir.

552
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,634
你瞅什么呢，新兵蛋子？
And what are you looking at, new boy?

553
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,233
周三
Wednesday.

554
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,275
巴克利，你干嘛去？
Barclay,what are you doing?

555
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,510
你不能胡来
You can’t just get up in the middle of mess.

556
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,398
闭嘴
Shut up.

557
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,353
少校
Major.

558
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:18,795
肃静
At ease!

559
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,675
泰勒
Tyler.

560
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,318
嘿，巴克利，咋回事？
Hi, Barclay. What’s up?

561
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,992
我要和你谈谈恰吉
I gotta talk to you about Chucky.

562
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,711
你是说查尔斯
You mean Charles.

563
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,557
你见过他了么？
Have you seen him?

564
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,708
昨晚以后就没见到过
Not since last night.

565
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,954
他一定藏起来了
He’s hiding somewhere.

566
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,030
他一知道你是自己一个人
He’s gonna lay low till he knows you’re alone,

567
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,235
就会过来找你
and then he’s gonna come after you.

568
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,389
他就是想玩游戏
He just wants to play.

569
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,628
听我说，泰勒
Listen to me, Tyler.

570
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,195
无论他说什么，无论他向你承诺什么
No matter what he says,no matter what he promises you,

571
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,838
你都要离他远远的
you’ve got to stay away from him.

572
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,713
不要让他骗了你，他是坏人
Don’t let him fool you.He’s bad.

573
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:59,275
查尔斯才不坏呢，他是好家伙
Charles isn’t bad.He’s a Good Guy.

574
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:00,628
我可以替他担保
It says so on his shirt.

575
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:02,233
他撒谎，泰勒
He lies, Tyler.

576
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,793
相信我，他是坏人
Believe me,he’s bad news.

577
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,871
他已经伤害许多人了
He’s hurt a lot of people.

578
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,798
科克伦上尉就是被他害死得
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.

579
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,711
你就是嫉妒我，因为他是我的好基友，而不是你的了
You’re just jealous ‘cause he’s my best friend now,instead of yours.

580
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,070
听着，你最好留着这个
Look, you better keep this.

581
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,918
怀特・赫斯特，你信不信
Whitehurst,you are without a doubt

582
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,755
最难维持的就是一个军人的仪表
the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.

583
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,909
面对他，你这一辈子都别想消停
Face it, you’re not cut out for this life.

584
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,913
你为什么不帮我个忙
Why don’t you do yourself a favor

585
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,911
滚出肯特军校呢？
and get the hell out of Kent?

586
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,753
如果你能帮我办到，我会的，长官
If I had any choice in the matter,I would, sir.

587
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,713
小滑头
Smart-ass.

588
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,913
滚吧！剪成光头了
Presto! You’re bald.

589
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,557
挺爽
Yeah.

590
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,628
怎么个事？
What the hell?

591
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,108
你是怎么进来的？
How did you get in there?

592
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:39,353
这个发型明显不合格，大兵
That haircut ain’t regulation, soldier.

593
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,838
你上次剪头是什么时候，嗯？
When’s the last time you had a trim, huh?

594
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,318
和头发吻别吧
Kiss it goodbye.

595
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,793
滚吧！你挂了！ 
Presto! You’re dead.

596
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:36,028
没错就是你
It’s definitely you.

597
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,516
我忘了我的....我的...
I just forgot my... My...

598
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,548
嘭！
Boo!

599
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,349
年度军事演习
The annual war games

600
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,876
是肯特军校已经延续了五十年的传统
have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.

601
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,918
科克伦上尉一直坚信传统的价值
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in the value of tradition.

602
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,230
不仅仅是让我们延续下去而已
He not only would have wanted us to go on,

603
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,072
而是命令我们去传承
he’d have ordered us to go on.

604
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,755
因此，军事演习扔按原计划进行
Therefore, the war games will proceed as scheduled.

605
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,510
军校助理谢尔顿上校将带领蓝队
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton will command the blue team.

606
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,117
洛林少校带领红队
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.

607
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,155
任务目标很简单
The objective is simple.

608
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:36,275
就是夺取对方的队旗
To capture the other team’s flag,

609
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,228
然后安全的带回基地
bring it back here safely to base.

610
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:40,954
洛林
Rawlings.

611
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,434
出发之前先到军械库领取武器
You will pick up your weapons in the armory before moving out.

612
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:52,911
你们会使用标准的0-3型爆花弹
You will be using the standard issue Springfield 0-3.

613
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,952
作为弹药
Your ammo.

614
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,108
谢尔顿
Shelton.

615
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,480
如果被打中，就代表阵亡
If you get hit,you are dead.

616
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,871
立刻回基地
Hike back to base.

617
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:19,110
两位指挥，管好你们的队伍
Cornmanders,take charge of your teams.

618
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:24,556
最强的队伍必胜
May the best team win.

619
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,759
祝好运，各位
Good luck, men and women.

620
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,951
欢迎入队
Nice of you to join us.

621
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,628
看起来波尼克今天没让你好过
Looks like Botnick’s in a pretty bad mood today.

622
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,793
怎么了？
What’s wrong?

623
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,797
没事，没啥事
Nothing. Nothing’s wrong.

624
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,197
没事，我很好，没事
Nothing’s wrong. I’m fine.Nothing’s wrong.

625
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,355
这个会让疼痛大大减轻的
This ought to slow the pricks down.

626
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,679
一！一！一！
Left! Left! Left!

627
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:23,916
# 再次踏上征途 #
# Here we go again #

628
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:26,076
# 再次踏上征途 #
# Here we go again #

629
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:30,072
# 带着旧日的枪火 #
# Same old stuff again #

630
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,233
# 行军于大道之上 #
# Marching down the avenue #

631
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,199
# 向前两英里，胜利就在前方 #
# Two more miles, we’ll be through #

632
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,637
# 我会亲自征服你 #
# I’ll be getting rid of you #

633
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,793
# 带着旧日的破枪火 #
# Same old ugly stuff #

634
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,077
# 再次踏上征途 #
# Here we go again #

635
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:55,119
# 行军于大道之上 #
# Marching down the avenue #

636
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,193
# 向前一英里，胜利就在前方 #
# One more miles, we’ll be through #

637
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,751
# 我会亲自征服你 #
# I’ll be getting rid of you #

638
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,989
怎么了，怀特・赫斯特？
What’s going on,Whitehurst?

639
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,596
你看到了，对不？你看到恰吉了
You saw something,didn’t you? You saw Chucky.

640
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,719
别太懦弱了，怀特・赫斯特
Don’t wimp out on me now, Whitehurst.

641
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,916
我需要你的帮助，那孩子也需要
I need your help.That kid needs your help.

642
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,751
我什么都没看见，行不？
I didn’t see anything, okay?

643
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,989
我压根就什么都没看见
I didn’t see anything at all.

644
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,318
# 你滚吧，对的，你滚吧 # 
# You left, right,you left #

645
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,391
# 你滚吧，对的，你滚吧 # 
# You left, right,you left #

646
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,233
# 你的军队滚蛋了 #
# Your military left #

647
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,077
埃尔斯，一定要确定营地周围的安全
Ellis, let’s make sure the perimeters are secured.

648
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,148
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

649
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,309
她检查了所有的窗口
She checks all the windows,

650
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,952
然后保姆就听到嘭..嘭..嘭..
and then the babysitter hears this thump, thump.

651
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:53,954
嘭嘭嘭.
Thumping.

652
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:57,715
就好像是什么东西在楼上在地板上拖着
Like something’s being dragged across the floor upstairs.

653
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,597
突然她想“我还没有检查孩子”
And suddenly she thinks,‘1 haven’t checked on the children.”

654
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,112
然后她就急忙上楼
So she hurries to the top of the stairs,

655
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:07,429
然后她到了楼上
and when she gets there,

656
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:12,798
她看到她的男朋友，被割断了手脚
she sees her boyfriend,completely dismembered,

657
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,474
用下巴一点点的在地板上爬着
dragging himself across the floor by his chin.

658
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:21,469
嘭...向前滑一下
Thump. Slide.

659
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,516
嘭...向前滑一下
Thump. Slide.

660
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,068
嘭...向前滑一下
Thump. Slide.

661
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:28,309
真恶心
That is gross.

662
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:34,349
嘿，伙计们，我有个好故事，而且是真的
Hey, you guys,I got a better story and it’s true.

663
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,717
是发生在精神病院的事
It’s about this mental institution,

664
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,074
离这里也没几英里
and it’s a few miles away from here.

665
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:42,588
嘿
Hey!

666
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,998
希望不是我的故事吓到了你
Hope it wasn’t something I said.

667
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:50,117
不是，抱歉！
No. I’m sorry.

668
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,668
德・斯尔娃，你认为红队的宿营地会是在哪呢？
De Silva, where do you think the red team’s camped out?

669
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,795
无论在哪
Could be anywhere.

670
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,514
谢尔顿都会找到的，他一直都这样
Shelton’ll find them.He always does.

671
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:08,193
顺便说下，你可以叫我克里斯汀娜
By the way,you can call me Kristin.

672
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,349
什么？
What?

673
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,027
克里斯汀娜
Kristin.

674
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:15,909
是我的的名，你的呢？
It’s my first name.Do you have one?

675
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:19,195
- 安迪 - 啊
- Andy.- Huh

676
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:22,269
来吧，安迪，给你看点东西
Come on, Andy,I want to show you something.

677
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,711
很酷吧，是吧？
Pretty cool, huh?

678
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,548
是的
Yeah.

679
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:39,036
我都快忘了还有这种地方
I almost forgot there were places like that.

680
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,831
只让人们感到快乐的地方
People just go to have fun.

681
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,552
听
Listen!

682
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,556
那边有人
Somebody’s out there.

683
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,474
可能是花鼠或者其他的
It’s probably just a chipmunk or something.

684
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,751
没啥能吓到你，是不？
Nothing scares you,does it?

685
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,389
是的
No.

686
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,992
妈的，我真想从这娃娃身体里出去
Man, I really gotta get out of this body.

687
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:19,117
我要去找泰勒
I’m going after Tyler.

688
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:21,271
你疯了吗？你找不到他的
Are you crazy? You’ll never find them.

689
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,509
赌点什么？
Wanna bet?

690
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,838
我从谢尔顿营房里偷的
I swiped this from Shelton’s tent.

691
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,713
我们扎营之前，他派出了一个侦察任务
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.

692
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,434
红队就在这附近
The red team is somewhere around here.

693
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:36,394
那孩子有危险，怀特・赫斯特
That kid’s a sitting duck,Whitehurst.

694
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,630
现在，你跟不跟我走？
Now, are you with me or not?

695
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,871
抱歉，不行
I’m sorry, I can’t.

696
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:10,757
醒醒吧，小姐们，我们出发了
Up and at ‘em, ladies,we’re moving out!

697
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:16,873
五分钟之内，我要让这个营地成空营
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes!

698
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,112
黎明在出发吧，长官
I thought we weren’t going until dawn, sir.

699
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:21,588
有人从上尉帐篷里偷走了战术地图
Someone stole the reconnaissance map out of the Colonel’s tent,

700
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:22,715
因此我们必须要转移
so we’re making our move now.

701
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,152
去准备吧，汉利
Get going, Hanley.

702
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,992
怀特・赫斯特
Whitehurst.

703
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,556
地图被偷了你浑然不觉，是吧？
You wouldn’t know anything about a missing map,would you?

704
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,197
那个混蛋巴克利呢？怀特・赫斯特
Where the hell’s Barclay? Whitehurst!

705
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,235
谢尔顿上校，你最好过来看看
Colonel Shelton,you’d better have a look in here, sir.

706
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,672
怎么了，埃尔斯？
What is it, Ellis?

707
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:54,030
巴克利擅离职守了，长官
Barclay’s gone AWOL, sir.

708
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,112
他偷走了地图
He stole the map.

709
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,873
这个该死的小叛徒叛变成红队了
That little fucking traitor’s doubling for the reds.

710
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,954
泰勒呢？
Where’s Tyler?

711
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:24,713
和一个叫查尔斯的擅离职守了
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.

712
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,398
安迪呢？
Where’s Andy?

713
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,838
怀特・赫斯特，他哪去了？
Whitehurst,where is he?

714
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,751
立，定！
Platoon, halt!

715
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:44,231
好了，德・斯尔娃你来搜查右翼
All right.De Silva, you’re going to take the right flank.

716
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,672
西格尔，你来搜擦左翼
Siegel, you take the left.I want you to check in

717
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,351
每五分钟电台通报一次
on the radio every five minutes.

718
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,112
- 是的，长官 - 好了，出发吧
- Yes, sir. - All right, move it.

719
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,278
剩下的四处散开
The rest of us are gonna spread out

720
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,152
然后到裂岩谷和埃尔斯会和
and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.

721
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:54,914
出发
Move out!

722
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,552
怀特・赫斯特，出发
Whitehurst, move!

723
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,833
谢谢你能来找我
Thanks for coming after me.

724
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,757
不然要朋友干嘛？
What are friends for?

725
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,074
藏起来
Duck.

726
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,436
现在没事了
That was a close one.

727
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,559
我们来玩“灵魂隐匿”吧？
Now, we can play Hide the Soul.

728
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:31,110
我累了，我不想玩那些无聊游戏了
I’m tired.I don’t want to play that dumb game anymore.

729
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,829
你真是他妈的累赘，知道不？
You’re a fucking drag,you know that?

730
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:35,478
嘴巴干净点，查尔斯
Watch your mouth,Charles.

731
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:37,072
别那么和说话
Stop calling me that!

732
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,074
拿刀子干嘛？
What’s the knife for?

733
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:45,117
一个好士兵是永远在准备战斗的，泰勒
A good soldier is always prepared, Tyler.

734
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,112
巴克利是对的，你不是好家伙
Barclay was right. You’re not a Good Guy.

735
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:53,309
抱歉，孩子，你对了，我是坏人
Sorry, kid,you got me. I’m bad.

736
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,471
现在，接受现实吧
Now,assume the position.

737
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:02,398
不要
No!

738
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:07,878
给我回来
Get back here!

739
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,594
巴克利！巴克利！
Barclay! Barclay!

740
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:18,354
泰勒
Tyler!

741
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,117
巴克利，你他妈的叛徒，地图还给我
Barclay,you fucking traitor,give me my map!

742
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:25,354
听我说，谢尔顿
Listen to me, Shelton!

743
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,828
知道我们怎么对待叛徒么,巴克利？
You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?

744
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,149
泰勒有麻烦了
Tyler’s in trouble.

745
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,548
怀特・赫斯特，帮帮我
Come on, Whitehurst,back me up.

746
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,753
埃尔斯少校，召回侧翼人员
Major Ellis,call in the flanks.

747
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,193
是，长官
Yes, sir.

748
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,310
德・斯尔娃，西格尔，是否收到？
De Silva, Siegel,do you copy?

749
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,274
德・斯尔娃，是否收到？
De Silva, do you copy?

750
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,518
德・斯尔娃，请回复
De Silva, come in.

751
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:57,229
西格尔马上就回来，长官
Siegel’s on his way back, sir.

752
01:08:57,319 --> 01:08:58,957
德・斯尔娃依然没有回复
No word yet from De Silva.

753
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:00,439
- 继续联系 - 是，长官
- Well, keep trying. - Yes, sir.

754
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,271
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

755
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,554
泰勒
Tyler!

756
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,914
巴克利
Barclay!

757
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,069
你还好吗，泰勒？
Are you okay, Tyler?

758
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:09,510
看看，看来我们抓到了一个小俘虏
Well, looks like we got ourselves a little POW.

759
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,750
巴克利，你是对的，查尔斯是坏人
Barclay, you were right.Charles is bad.

760
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,033
他刚才要杀我
He tried to hurt me.

761
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,469
查尔斯是他妈谁？
Who the hell’s Charles?

762
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,393
请回复，巴克利，听到请回复！
Come in, Barclay.Come in.

763
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:19,114
这他妈是谁？
Who the hell is that?

764
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,592
是查尔斯
It’s Charles.

765
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,595
你他妈谁？
Who is this?

766
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,314
让巴克利接，傻瓜
Put Barclay on, jarhead.

767
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,194
是红队的人，他们想玩点花样
It’s the reds.They’re up to something.

768
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,675
你想要什么？
What do you want?

769
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,511
我想要那个小孩
I want the kid.

770
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,149
把他带到破吉普车上，不然你们会付出代价的
Bring him up to the old jeep or there’ll be hell to pay.

771
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,070
- 安迪，别听他的 - 德・斯尔娃
- Andy, don’t do it! - De Silva!

772
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,838
听到没，巴克利？
You hear that,Barclay?

773
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,514
别他妈碰他，你他妈的
Don’t touch her,you son of a bitch.

774
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,319
现在，把那孩子带过来，不然我就宰了她
Now, bring me the kid or I’ll waste her.

775
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:55,112
红队，红队，回复，红队
Red team, red team.Come in, red team.

776
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,836
我是红队，完毕
This is red team. Over.

777
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,599
破吉普车这边出了点情况
We got a situation up here at the old jeep.

778
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,269
蓝队出现了，建议你们立刻转移
Blue team sighted.Advise you to move your troops in.

779
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,234
希望他们喜欢被牵着鼻子走的感觉
I hope they like the taste of lead.

780
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,030
然后我们就在这坐着，看烟火纷飞
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.

781
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,716
好了，你们两个先过去，引他们出来
All right, you two are going to go on up ahead,draw ‘em out.

782
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,788
剩下的把这里包围
The rest of us are gonna circle around.

783
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,029
谢尔顿，这不是游戏
Shelton,this is no game.

784
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:26,997
我告诉你，这家伙很危险
I’m telling you,this guy is dangerous.

785
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,435
放松，巴克利，都是些颜料
Relax, Barclay.It’s only paint.

786
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,837
好了，出发
All right.Let’s do it.

787
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,319
我好怕，巴克利
I’m scared, Barclay.

788
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:46,752
是，我也是
Yeah, me, too.

789
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:56,311
好了，孩子，赶紧过来
All right, kid.Get over here!

790
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:58,154
不
No.

791
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,516
别他妈涮我
Don’t fuck with me!

792
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:03,548
我会把你们都炸成片的
I’ll blow all of you to pieces!

793
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,993
滚过去
Beat it.

794
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,952
现在，坐下来，然后闭嘴
Now, just get down and shut up.

795
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,828
好的
Yeah.

796
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,868
啊哦
Ow!

797
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,635
停止射击
Hold your fire!

798
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,708
停止射击
Hold your fire!

799
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:56,033
德・斯尔娃，他们人在哪？
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?

800
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:58,719
嘿，大兵
Hi, soldier.

801
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,713
卧了个槽
Fuck me.

802
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:18,878
真够劲
All right!

803
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,548
妈的
Shit!

804
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,993
卧倒
Stay down!

805
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,518
他们用的真子弹
They’re using live rounds!

806
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:41,599
停止射击！停止射击！
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

807
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:43,631
停止射击！
Hold your fire!

808
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,271
哦，天啊，他没有呼吸了，滚开
Oh, God,he’s not breathing.Get away from him!

809
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,158
是你干的，是不？
You did this,didn’t you?

810
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,957
你他妈的狗杂种
You sick son of a bitch!

811
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:04,752
我要杀了你
Now I’m gonna kill you!

812
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,636
住手，放开他
Stop it! Get off of him!

813
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,755
不是他干的，住手
He didn’t do it! Stop it!

814
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,954
- 再见吧 - 住手
- Let go of me - Stop it!

815
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:12,396
再见了，混蛋们
Sayonara, suckers.

816
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,148
不！放开她
No! Get off of him!

817
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:16,315
住手！不是他干的
Stop it! He didn’t do it!

818
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,716
- 再见吧 - 不是他干的，住手
- Let go of me.- He didn’t do it! Stop!

819
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:27,314
小心
Look out!

820
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,034
不！哦，天啊，怎么回事？
No! Oh, my God,what happened?

821
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:48,552
是怀特・赫斯特
It’s Whitehurst.

822
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,438
哦，天啊，埃尔斯，埃尔斯，怎么回事？
Oh, my God! Ellis!Ellis, what happened?

823
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,713
爱泼斯坦，到底他妈的怎么回事？
Epstein,what the hell happened?

824
