(Shutter clicks )

4
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,797
This is Andy Barclay. Eight
years ago, he started the scandal

5
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,917
that nearly crippled this company,

6
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:10,883
claiming his Good Guy doll Chucky
Was possessed by...Charles Lee Ray,

7
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,441
the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.

8
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,523
(Murmuring)

9
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,762
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,924
after all the lawsuits
and negative publicity,

11
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:26,323
When the company is finally
getting back on its feet again,

12
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:30,246
Where is the Wisdom in putting
the Good Guy back on the market?

13
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,996
Mr Sullivan,
before any of this happened,

14
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,323
the Good Guy outsold
all our other toys two to one.

15
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,643
Even now, interest in
the marketplace is at its peak.

16
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:44,999
The factory is running again.
We should be in stores by next Week.

17
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:49,802
We cannot let the fantasies
of one disturbed boy

18
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,838
influence company policy.

19
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:56,836
What if the doll somehow affects
another child in a negative Way?

20
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:59,879
You could have
a public relations nightmare.

21
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:04,079
You know, one of the hardest
things about this business

22
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,925
is that it is a business.

23
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,765
It doesn't matter What We're selling,

24
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:14,927
Whether it's cars, nuclear Weapons,
or, yes, even toys.

25
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,845
The bottom line is the bottom line.

26
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:23,085
And What are children, after all,
but consumer trainees?

27
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,277
(Chuckling)

28
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:28,080
Andy Barclay is ancient history.

29
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:33,526
No one remembers him. Nobody cares.

30
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,637
I have made up my mind.

31
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,598
We're moving ahead.

32
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,319
Thank you.

33
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,597
(Woman ) OK.
(Man ) All right.

34
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,524
Mr Sullivan.

35
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,365
If there's nothing I can say
to convince you,

36
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:54,002
then I must go on record With
my position: I'm against this.

37
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,198
Your position is
crystal clear, Miles,

38
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,397
and you can be sure I Won't forget.

39
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:03,520
Just a minute, folks!
We have a little surprise.

40
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,876
The guys at the factory
sent this over.

41
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:09,681
It's the first one :
the Good Guy of the 90's!

42
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,558
(Applause and cheers )

43

Well, if there's nothing else,
I'll get going.

44
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,766
Fine.

45
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,162

my Wife's expecting me.

46
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:38,677
I  It's our anniversary.
I  Fine, Petzold.

47
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:42,959
Well, I guess I could review
the Larabie report after dinner.

48
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:46,238
I  Good night, Mr Sullivan.

I'm asking you.

116
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:06,000
I never felt comfortable
With those people.

117

They Weren't family,
they Were strangers.

All right, listen up, Barclay.

I'm Willing to cut you slack

Thank you. I'm fine.

I'm Andy.

178
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:12,597
You must be new. Otherwise you'd know
there's no individuality here.

179
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,444
Certainly no first names.

He Was supposed to get this package.

254
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,365
Tampering With the mail
is a federal offence.

255
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,319
Sorry. Is he your best friend?

256
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:48,566
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.

257
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,837
Wait a minute.

258
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,481

265
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,638
Is there anything you can't do?

266
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,316
Yeah. I can't seem to get
thrown out of this place.

267
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,437
Barclay, meet De Silva.

268

No. Keep both eyes open.

274
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:46,116
Keep your sights on the target.

275
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:50,076
Now hold your breath.

276
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,516
SqueeZe the trigger,
don't pull it.

277
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,998
You're not concentrating.

278
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:05,601
It Was really great
What you did for us back there.

279
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,444
Shelton's a major dick.

Tell me about it.

281

(Tyler) Can't We play hide and seek?

282
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,125
(Chucky ) Hold still.

283
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,476
(Tyler) What do you call this game?

284
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:27,918
Hide the soul. Trust me.
You're gonna love it.

285
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,117
Whatever you say, Charles.

293
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,806
Shit!

294
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,441
Charles, stop sWearing.

295
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:05,799
Per soldier, We're gonna need
the Springfield OI 3s

296
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,998
marked for both the red team
and the blue team.

297
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,686
What are you doing, Tyler?

298
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:13,558
We're playing hide the soul.

299

301
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:26,402
But Charles is my new best friend.

302
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:30,725
Tyler, you know better than to
talk back to a superior officer.

303

Barclay!

325
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,483
It's not a baton, Barclay.

326
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,077
You look like a goddamn
majorette over here.

327
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,798
I'm not used to guns, sir.

328
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:32,439
Does this look like
a gun to you, Barclay?

329
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:36,480
It's a rifle! Major Ellis?

330
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,757
Show the new boy the difference!

331
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,758
This is my rifle, this is my gun.

332
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:44,844
This is for shooting,
and this is for fun.

333
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,364
A soldier's rifle
is his best friend.

334
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:55,083
Remember that.

335
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:09,755
Stop!

336
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,166
Shit!

337
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,596
(Chucky ) Help! Please, mister!

338
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,524
Please, somebody!

339
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:28,798
I  Jesus!
I  (Chucky ) I'm stuck! Mister!

340
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,323
I'm in here!

341
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,403
(Man ) Hold on. I'm coming!

342
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,556
Where are you?

343
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:41,644
I'm coming.

344
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:50,597
Yell or something! Make a noise!

345
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,358
Where are you?

346
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,164
What the...?

347
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,115
(Gasps )

348
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,759
Oh, my God.

349
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,479
No! Stop!

350
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:20,316
(Sinister laughter)

351
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:25,323
Stop! Ah!

352
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,281
Ahh!

353
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:31,317
(Screaming)

354
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:39,246
(Scream echoes )

355
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:41,278
(Shelton ) Fall out.

356
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,484
You get back there.

357
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:07,486
Better finish unpacking. Shelton's
notorious for surprise inspections.

358
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,244
What are you doing?

359
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:16,723
What does it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.

360
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,327
He makes you polish his shoes?

361
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:22,677
No, I offered out of
the kindness of my heart(!)

362
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:31,041
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane
With that doll today?

363
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,043
No. What doll?.

364
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,237
He Was carrying a Good Guy doll

365
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:38,245
just before the accident
With the garbage truck.

366
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,437
Good Guys, I remember those.

367
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:43,284
Yeah, me, too.

368
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:52,678
Uh, lights out in a few minutes.
I'm going to go get Washed up.

369
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:09,723
Barclay, Sergeant Clark Wondered
if you got that package.

370
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,361
I  What package?
I  You got a package in the mail.

371
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:15,444
Tyler Was bringing it.
Didn't you get it?

372
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:16,681
No.

373
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:21,718
Who sent me a package?

374
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,401
ow!

375
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:43,202
Hey, long time no see, pal.

376
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:46,205
No, you're dead. We killed you!

377
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:51,401
You know What they say, you just
can't keep a Good Guy down.

378
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:53,796
(Laughing)

379
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,124
Andy, how you've grown.

380
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,443
You're not gonna kill me.
You need my body.

381
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,284
Wrong again, Wimp.

382
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:09,798
I got fresh meat lined up and you
Won't spoil it, not this time.

383
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,122
Tyler.

384
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:16,479
Yeah, just think.
Chucky's gonna be a bro.

385
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:20,156
I'm not gonna let you
get away With this.

386
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,558
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.

387
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:29,678
(Chucky screaming)

388
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:44,036
What's the matter, Barclay, huh?
You homesick?

389
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:46,078
You miss your mommy?

390
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,884
What the fuck is this?

391
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:52,202
Sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.

392
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,602
Just give me back the doll.

393
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,445
No, no, you listen to me.

394
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,842
You tell Whitehurst
he's off the hook.

395
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,037
I got myself another slave.

396
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,915
And clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.

397
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,764
What about the doll?.

398
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:14,045
My kid sister's birthday
is coming up.

399
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,681
I think she's gonna love it,
don't you?

400
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,484
(Door creaks )

401
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:45,040
(Rustling)

402
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,484
Oh, shit.

403
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,284
Andy.

404
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:36,484
What the fuck?

405
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:41,039
No, stop!

406
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:42,839
What the fuck are you doing?

407
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,764
You Wouldn't believe me.

408
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,843
Where's the doll, Barclay?

409
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:51,605
Where's the fucking doll?.

410
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,285
I  You took it.
I  No!

411
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,318
What's going on?

412
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,562
Somebody sure as hell took it.

413
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:13,841
It's almost midnight, Colonel.
Is this really necessary?

414
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,923
I'm Weeding out a thief, sir.

415
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:19,437
You've told me it's important
to uphold the honour code.

416
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,843
I'm trying to impress that
upon the men, sir.

417
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:27,237
All right, Shelton, make your point.

418
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:30,040
But I Want everybody back inside
at O1OO hours.

419
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,884
Yes, sir.

420
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:40,042
When We get through With Barclay,
he'll be living in a World of shit.

421
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:42,647
We've got an hour
so let's make it count.

422
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:44,678
Yes, sir.

423
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:48,645
(Ellis ) All right, ladies,

424
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:50,643
I Want to see 'em high!

425
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:52,405
Higher!

426
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,602
I think I'm gonna throw up.

427
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,079
(Boy ) You're dead, new boy.
(Second boy ) Fucking geek.

428
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:34,796
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me, your best friend."

429
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,565
Shit.

430
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,439

431
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,758
Come and find me!

435
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:00,359
(Soldiers yell)

436
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,079
Get those knees up, ladies!

437
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:05,358
I  Where do the kids sleep?
I  Above the portico, Why?

438
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:09,036
(Ellis ) You're Wearing combat
boots, not ballet slippers.

439
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,601
I  Come on, move!
I  Barclay?

440
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:15,879
(Ellis ) It can get Worse than this!
Get the lead out. Move it!

441
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:20,079
Faster, faster. Let's go, girls.
Keep those knees in the sky!

442
00:43:25,087 --> 00:43:27,123
You son of a bitch!

443
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,362
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.

444
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:35,602
Let's see What kind
of tough guy you are.

445
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:39,478
Get your head around.

446
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:48,479
(Giggles )

447
00:44:05,887 --> 00:44:07,286

453
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:49,679
All right, Barclay, I'm curious.
What are you trying to prove?

454
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:53,037
I  Forget it.
I  No, really, I Want to know.

455
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:57,046
All right. The doll's alive.
He's after Tyler.

456
00:44:57,087 --> 00:45:01,126
I  Right. Forget it.
I  I hope he can handle himself.

457
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,927
(De Silva, Whispering) Shut up.

458
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:20,325

You know, I don't see
What you see in that guy, anyWay.

462
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:39,885
I don't know, he's different

488
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:11,917
Don't. He looks stupid.
He looks like a Wuss.

489
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:13,923
No, he looks sWeet.

490
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:15,480
(Distant clang)

491
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,518
You guys, someone's coming.

492
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,083
Come on, let's go.

493
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:22,960
(Tyler) Stop! What about Charles?

494
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:28,884
Bleurgh!

495
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,284
This means War.

496
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:34,998
What the hell?.

497
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,283
I like to be hugged.

498
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:03,919
(Clattering)

499
00:49:14,127 --> 00:49:15,879
(Screaming)

500
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,283
(Gasping)

501
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:22,636
(Groaning)

502
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:30,526
Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me!

503
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,001
(Gasping)

504
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:06,881
A man lives through two tours in Nam,
then one night he just drops dead.

505
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:08,918
Doesn't make any sense.

506
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,761
( # Reveille )

507
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:23,124
(Shelton ) At ease!

508
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:26,762
We Will now take a moment of silence
to honour Colonel Cochrane.

509
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:31,076
He Was a fine man,
and he Will be sorely missed.

510
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,402
Bow your heads for prayer.

511
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:39,119
(Man ) Take two!

512
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:58,477
It's getting shaggy, Carlson.
I Want to see you on Friday.

513
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:00,483
Yes, sir.

514
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:03,121
I  Monday, Fabricio.
I  Yes, sir.

515
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,324
My man.

516
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:16,124
Tuesday.

517
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,685
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.

518
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:27,082
When's the last time you had a trim?

519
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,083
two Weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.

520
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,324
You think?! I Want to see you
right after breakfast. Got it?

521
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,358
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.

522
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,682
And What are you looking at, new boy?

523
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,319
Wednesday.

524
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:50,436
Barclay, What are you doing?
You can't get up during mess.

525
00:51:53,847 --> 00:51:55,883
(All laughing)

526
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:02,599
Major.

527
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:04,676
At ease!

528
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:18,477
I  Tyler.
I  Hi, Barclay. What's up?

529
00:52:18,527 --> 00:52:20,722
I gotta talk to you about Chucky.

530
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:22,485
You mean Charles.

531
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:24,324
Have you seen him?

532
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:28,683
I  Not since last night.
I  He's hiding somewhere.

533
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:32,003
He'll lay low till you're alone,
then he'll come after you.

534
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,958
I  He's just playing.
I  Listen.

535
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:39,240
No matter What he says or What he
promises you, stay away from him.

536
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:41,005
He's bad.

537
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:44,722
Charles isn't bad. He's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.

538
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:47,725
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.

539
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:51,806
He's hurt a lot of people.
Colonel Cochrane Was one of them.

540
00:52:51,847 --> 00:52:56,125
You're jealous because he's my
best friend instead of yours.

541
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:03,119
Look. You better keep this.

542
00:53:05,927 --> 00:53:08,885
Whitehurst,
you are Without a doubt

543
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:13,079
the sorriest excuse for a soldier
to ever disgrace these Walls.

544
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:17,722
Face it, you're not
cut out for this life.

545
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:21,282
Do yourself a favour
and get the hell out of Kent.

546
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:24,683
If I had any choice
in the matter, I Would, sir.

547
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:25,716
SmartI ass.

548
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:28,916
Presto. You're bald.

549
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:48,321
(Whistling)

550
00:54:03,847 --> 00:54:05,405
What the hell?.

551
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:10,678
How did you get in there?

552
00:54:16,727 --> 00:54:19,560
That haircut ain't regulation,
soldier.

553
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,719
When's the last time
you had a trim, huh?

554
00:54:32,527 --> 00:54:34,518
Kiss it goodbye.

555
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:42,678
(BuZZing)

556
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:47,561
(Laughing)

557
00:55:03,407 --> 00:55:06,001
Presto. You're dead.

558
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:07,639
(Chucky laughing)

559
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:14,167
It's definitely you.

560
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,563
(Cackling)

561
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:29,036
I just forgot my...

562
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,526
Boo!

563
00:55:38,007 --> 00:55:42,603
The annual War games have been a
tradition at Kent for over 5O years.

564
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:47,084
Colonel Cochrane believed
in the value of tradition.

565
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:49,436
He not only Would have
Wanted us to go on,

566
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:51,318
he'd have ordered us to go on.

567
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:57,761
Therefore, the War games
Will proceed as scheduled.

568
00:55:57,807 --> 00:55:59,638
(Soldiers yell)

569
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:04,441
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton
Will command the blue team.

570
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,717
Major Rollins Will
head up the reds.

571
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:11,716
The objective is simple:
to capture the other team's flag,

572
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,520
bring it back here safely to base.

573
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:16,125
Rollins.

574
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:21,275
You Will pick up your Weapons
in the armoury before moving out.

575
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:27,485
You Will be using
the standard issue Springfield OI 3.

576
00:56:29,047 --> 00:56:31,038
Your ammo.

577
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,286
Shelton.

578
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:48,078
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.

579
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:52,882
Commanders,
take charge of your teams.

580
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,236
May the best team Win.

581
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,881
Good luck, men and Women.

582
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,678
Nice of you to join us.

583
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:10,639
Looks like Botnick's
in a pretty bad mood today.

584
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:14,043
I  What's Wrong?
I  Nothing.

585
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:15,918
Nothing's Wrong.

586
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:20,519
Nothing's Wrong. I'm fine.
Nothing's Wrong.

587
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:36,360
This ought to slow the pricks down.

588
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:52,642
(Man ) Left! Left! Left!

589
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:56,680
(Man ) # Here We go again
(All) # Here We go again

590
00:57:56,727 --> 00:58:00,436
(Man ) # Same old stuff again
(All) # Same old stuff again

591
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:04,196
(Man ) # Marching down the avenue
(All) # Marching down the avenue

592
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,317
(Man ) # two more miles,
We'll be through

593
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,437
(All) # two more miles,
We'll be through

594
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:12,765
(Man ) # I'll be getting rid of you
(All) # I'll be getting rid of you

595
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:16,402
(Man ) # Same old ugly stuff
(All) # Same old ugly stuff

00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,156
(Man ) # Here We go again

598
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,037

599
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:28,760

600
00:58:28,807 --> 00:58:33,278
(Man ) # I'll be getting rid of you
(All) # I'll be getting rid of you #

601
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:35,318
What's going on, Whitehurst?

602
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:41,046
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.

603
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:44,443
Don't Wimp out on me now.
I need your help.

604
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,284
That kid needs your help.

605
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,876
I didn't see anything, OK?
I didn't see anything at all.

606
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:53,886
(Man ) # Your left, right, your left
(All) # Your left, right, your left #

607
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:13,124
Ellis, let's make sure
the perimeters are secured.

608
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,840
She checks all the Windows,

609
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:19,766
and then the babysitter
hears this thump, thump.

610
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:20,956
Thumping.

611
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:25,159
Like something's being dragged
across the floor upstairs.

612
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:28,563
And suddenly she thinks,
"I haven't checked on the children."

613
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:33,635
So she hurries to the top of the
stairs, and When she gets there,

614
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:39,717
she sees her boyfriend,
completely dismembered,

615
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:44,045
dragging himself
across the floor by his chin.

616
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:51,004
Thump. Slide. Thump. Slide.

617
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:54,119
I  Thump. Slide.
I  (Girl) That is gross.

618
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:59,924
Hey, you guys,
I got a better story and it's true.

619
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:05,360
It's about this mental institution,
and it's a few miles away from here.

620
01:00:06,487 --> 01:00:08,762
Hey!

621
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:12,282
Hope it Wasn't something I said.

622
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:14,921
No. I'm sorry.

623
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:24,278
De Silva, Where do you think
the red team's camped out?

624
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:27,717
Could be anyWhere.
Shelton'll find them. He always does.

625
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:33,077
By the Way,
you can call me Kirsten.

626
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:36,278
I  What?
I  Kirsten.

627
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:40,878
It's my first name. Do you have one?

628
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:43,077
I  Andy.
I  Oh.

629
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:46,199
Come on, Andy,
I Want to show you something.

630
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:57,157
Pretty cool, huh?

631
01:00:57,207 --> 01:00:59,198
Yeah.

632
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:04,803
(Barclay ) I forgot those places
exist. People just go to have fun.

633
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,077
I  (Crackling)
I  Listen!

634
01:01:07,127 --> 01:01:09,118
Somebody's out there.

635
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:14,204
It's probably just a chipmunk
or something.

636
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:19,318
I  Nothing scares you, does it?
I  No.

637
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:29,806
Man, I really gotta
get out of this body!

638
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:40,121
I'm going after Tyler.

639
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:42,476
Are you craZy?
You'll never find them.

640
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,917
Want to bet?
I sWiped this from Shelton's tent.

641
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:50,040
He sent out a reconnaissance mission
right before We pitched camp.

642
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,726
The red team
is somewhere around here.

643
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:56,402
That kid's a sitting duck,
Whitehurst.

644
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:58,881
Are you With me or not?

645
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:03,518
I'm sorry, I can't.

646
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:29,918
(Ellis ) Up and at 'em, ladies,
We're moving out!

647
01:02:32,087 --> 01:02:36,046
I Want this camp to be
a ghost town in five minutes!

648
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:38,476
I thought We Weren't going
until dawn.

649
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:41,519
Someone stole the map so
We're making our move now.

650
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,603
Get going, Hanley.

651
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,519
Whitehurst.

652
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:51,116
You Wouldn't know anything
about a missing map, Would you?

653
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:58,042
Where the hell's Barclay? Whitehurst!

654
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:03,841
Colonel Shelton, you'd better
have a look in here, sir.

655
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:09,276
What is it, Ellis?

656
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,397
Barclay's gone awOL, sir.

657
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:15,681
He stole the map.

658
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:19,083
That little fucking traitor's
doubling for the reds!

659
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:38,197
Where's Tyler?

660
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,920
He Went awOL
With some guy named Charles.

661
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,517
Where's Andy?

662
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:52,558
Whitehurst, Where is he?

663
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,598
(Ellis ) Platoon, halt!

664
01:03:55,687 --> 01:03:59,566
All right. De Silva, you're
going to take the right flank.

665
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:03,646
Siegel, you take the left. Check in
on the radio every five minutes.

666
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:04,676
Move it.

667
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:08,481
The rest Will spread out
and meet Ellis at Split Rock.

668
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,324
Move out!

669
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:13,518
Whitehurst, move!

670
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:25,523
I  Thanks for coming after me.
I  What are friends for?

671
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:32,118
Duck.

672
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:41,122
I  That Was a close one.
I  Now We can play hide the soul.

673
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:44,842
I'm tired. I don't Want to play
that dumb game any more.

674
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,321
You're a fucking drag,
you know that?

675
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:48,880
Watch your mouth, Charles.

676
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,406
Stop calling me that!

677
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:53,285
What's the knife for?

678
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:58,003
A good soldier
is always prepared, Tyler.

679
01:04:58,047 --> 01:05:00,880
Barclay Was right.
You're not a Good Guy.

680
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:05,842
Sorry, kid, you got me. I'm bad.

681
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:08,959
Now, assume the position.

682
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:15,362
(Tyler) No!
(Chucky ) Ahh!

683
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:19,957
Get back here!

684
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:22,475
Barclay! Barclay!

685
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:29,886
Tyler!

686
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,724
(twig snaps )

687
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:35,485
Barclay, you fucking traitor,
give me my map!

688
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:36,801
Listen...

689
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:39,407
You got any idea What We do
to traitors?

690
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:43,235
Tyler's in trouble.
Come on, Whitehurst, back me up.

691
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:48,363
I  Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
I  Yes, sir.

692
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,796
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?

693
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,838
De Silva, do you copy?

694
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:59,726
(Ellis on radio ) 'De Silva, come in.'

695
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:04,438
I  Ahh!
I  Ahh!

696
01:06:05,607 --> 01:06:07,598
Siegel's on his Way back, sir.

697
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:10,320
I  No Word yet from De Silva.
I  Keep trying.

698
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:13,245
I  Help! Help!
I  Tyler!

699
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:15,960
I  Barclay!
I  Are you OK, Tyler?

700
01:06:16,007 --> 01:06:18,885
Well, looks like We got
ourselves a little Pow.

701
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:22,317
Barclay, you Were right.
Charles is bad. He tried to hurt me.

702
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:23,720
Who the hell's Charles?

703
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:26,884
(Chucky on radio )
'Come in, Barclay. Come in.'

704
01:06:26,927 --> 01:06:31,079
I  Who the hell is that?
I  It's Charles.

705
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:37,478
I  Who is this?
I  (Chucky ) 'Put Barclay on, jarhead.'

706
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,882
It's the reds.
They're up to something.

707
01:06:39,927 --> 01:06:41,883
What do you Want?

708
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:46,443
'I Want the kid. Bring him to the
old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.'

709
01:06:46,487 --> 01:06:49,320
I  (De Silva ) 'Andy, don't do it!'
I  De Silva!

710
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:50,766
You hear that, Barclay?

711
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:53,446
(Barclay ) 'Don't touch her,
you son of a bitch.'

712
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,445
Bring me the kid or I'll Waste her.

713
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:02,716
Red team, red team.
Come in, red team.

714
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:05,076
(Rollins ) 'This is red team. Over.'

715
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:08,005
(Chucky ) We got a situation
up at the old Jeep.

716
01:07:08,047 --> 01:07:12,279
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.

717
01:07:12,327 --> 01:07:15,797
(Chucky ) I hope they like
the taste of lead.

718
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:19,044
Now just sit back
and Watch the sparks fly.

719
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:28,639
All right, you two go on
up ahead, draw 'em out.

720
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:30,245
We'll circle around.

721
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:33,085
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.

722
01:07:33,127 --> 01:07:35,880
Relax, Barclay. It's only paint.

723
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,918
All right. Let's do it.

724
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:51,483
I  I'm scared, Barclay.
I  Yeah, me too.

725
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:01,439
All right, kid. Get over here!

726
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:03,239
No.

727
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,403
Don't fuck With me!

728
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:08,086
I'll blow all of you to pieces!

729
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,441
Beat it.

730
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:31,798
Now, just get down and shut up!

731
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,844
Yeah!

732
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:44,405
(Gunfire )

733
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:48,916

734
01:08:50,087 --> 01:08:52,760
I  Hold your fire!
I  (Ellis ) Hold your fire!

735
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,838
De Silva, Where the hell is
everybody?

736
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:02,477
Hi, soldier.

737
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,159
Fuck me.

738
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:21,038
All right!

739
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:23,964
(Gunfire )

740
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:27,966
I  Stay down!
I  They're using live rounds!

741
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:29,963
(Cackling)

742
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:40,119
(Gunfire continues )

743
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,362
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

744
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:45,001
I  Hold your fire!
I  (Chucky laughing)

745
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:58,398
Oh, God, he's not breathing.
Get away from him!

746
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:00,324
You did this, didn't you?

747
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,597
You sick son of a bitch!

748
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:04,478
I'm going to kill you!

749
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:08,645
Stop it! Get off of him!
He didn't do it! Stop it!

750
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:12,396
Sayonara, suckers.

751
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:14,438
(De Silva ) No! Get off of him!

752
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:17,638
Stop it! He didn't do it!

753
01:10:19,607 --> 01:10:23,316
(De Silva ) He didn't do it! Stop!

754
01:10:24,927 --> 01:10:26,201
Look out!

755
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:30,840
(De Silva )
Get off him! He didn't do it!

756
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:45,439
(Girl) Oh! Oh, my God, What happened?

757
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:46,602
It's Whitehurst.

758
01:10:46,647 --> 01:10:49,002
(Girl) Oh, my God!
Ellis, What happened?

759
01:10:49,047 --> 01:10:52,357
I  What the hell happened?
I  Who fucked With the rifles?

760
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:54,921
(Ellis ) OK, OK.

761
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:57,606
and get a medic up here now!

762
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:00,518

(Screaming)

767
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,317
(Man ) This is your last Warning.

768
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,165
Give that thing a rest
or you're out of here.

769
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:35,246
I  We're not bothering anybody.
I  You're bothering me. Keep it down.

770
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:37,278
(Girl) JeeZ!

771
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:47,122
I  Mister, you got to help me.
I  What's Wrong? What's the matter?

772
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,237
Charles. He's after me.

773
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:51,517
I  Who's Charles?
I  He's a Good Guy.

774
01:11:51,567 --> 01:11:54,286
I  He Wants to play hide the soul.
I  OK, slow down!

775
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:58,684
Are you from Kent?
What's your name, son?

776
01:11:58,727 --> 01:12:00,957
Ronald Tyler.
Private firstI class, sir.

777
01:12:01,007 --> 01:12:04,443
Have a seat.
How about some gum, Private?

778
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:09,117
I know how it must hurt When
a friend does something bad to you.

779
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,885
Sure does.

780
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:14,476
But I bet your friend...
What's his name, Charles?

781
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:18,998
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.

782
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:21,686
No, he isn't. He Wants to hurt me.

783
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:23,604
Nobody's going to hurt you.

784
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:26,684
I know What Will cheer you up.
Look What I found.

787
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:00,796
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.

788
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:29,644

I  Were you scared?
I  (Both) No!

793
01:13:57,527 --> 01:14:00,963
Let's get some popcorn
and go on one more ride.

794
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:04,601
(Chucky ) Perfect. In there.

795
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:11,765
Don't even think about it.

796
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,604
I  Come on.
I  OK.

797
01:14:22,647 --> 01:14:24,638
