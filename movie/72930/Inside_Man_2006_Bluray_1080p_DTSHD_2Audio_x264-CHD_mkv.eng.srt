1
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:45,314
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,052
Pay strict attention to what l say

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,988
because l choose my words carefully
and l never repeat myself.

4
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:55,059
l've told you my name. That's the ''who.''

5
00:00:56,529 --> 00:01:00,329
The ''where'' could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

6
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,130
DALTON: But there's a vast difference

7
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:05,898
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

8
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:09,035
The ''what'' is easy.

9
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:14,543
Recently l planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:17,215
That's also the ''when.''

11
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:21,981
As for the ''why,''
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:24,523
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,082
Because l can.

14
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,820
Which leaves us only with the ''how.''

15
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:34,098
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,868
lies the rub.

17
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,029
So, your mother tells me about

18
00:04:57,836 --> 00:05:01,294
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

19
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:04,103
-Okay?
-All right, okay.

20
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,236
He's crazy.

21
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,416
-Now? On 51st? 50...
-CHAlM: Yeah, that's where he is right now.

22
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:17,546
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

23
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,386
HAMMOND: What do l have to...

24
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:24,618
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
l'll put it on Mr. Ansinori's card.

25
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:28,689
Whatever. lt's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

26
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:33,530
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

27
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,840
l want to snap this guy's neck,
l swear to God.

28
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:43,276
NANCY: So what?

29
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,110
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

30
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,985
They could've been to me.
lt's my birthday, so...

31
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,450
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

(NANCY CHUCKLES)

33
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,289
Okay. This is funny.

34
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:04,398
l got this guy in front of me
that thinks l don't see him looking at me.

35
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,701
Fantastic. God damn it.

36
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,400
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

37
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:12,035
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

38
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,977
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

39
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,375
Yeah. Fine.

40
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:18,245
l don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

41
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:19,579
-Sorry.
-All right?

42
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,551

He claims he's got some hostages in there.

Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can l do for you?

164
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,273
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

165
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:28,573
Oh, my.

166
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:33,041
-Has anybody been hurt?
-l don't think so, but there are hostages.

167
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:35,476
Oh, how awful.

168
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:40,280
-Which branch is it?

Thank you, Katherine.

l'm sorry, Mr. Case.

172
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:02,980
Oh, dear God.

173
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:08,111
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

174
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,484
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

175
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:18,627
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

176
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,393
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

177
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:23,400
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

178
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,800
The door was locked.
l tried to take a look inside

179
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,271
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a .357 in my face,

180
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,935
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

181
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,740
-See any other gunmen?
-No, sir. l couldn't see anything at all.

182
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,474
-You hear anything inside?
-No, sir,

183
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:40,541
but with that .357 sticking in my face,
l can't really be sure. l'm sorry.

184
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,077
Okay.

185
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:46,853
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

186
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,291
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

187
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,419
-Yeah, once.
-Really?

188
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,258
Yeah, by a 1 2-year-old.

189
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,766
-What was that like?
-Not one of my better days.

190
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,961
l bet. All right, well, look.

191
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,698
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

192
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,706
lf you don't mind,
l'd rather hang around a while,

193
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:04,537
at least until we make contact.

194
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,873
That's what l like to hear, Sergeant.

195
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,395
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

the bank has been robbed.

So, what do we got?

262
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,036
l got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

263
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,637
and a bank, and about a million spectators,

-so l'm kind of busy.
-l understand.

265
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:20,211
The way this works, Mr. Frazier,
is l deal with Mr. Grossman.

So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

No, it's not okay, Captain.

is the big dick today, all right?

you can speak to me, all right?

with a detailed briefing?

-Okay.
-We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

all right? Okay?

-All right.
-Good to see you, Captain.

282
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:07,893
Shouldn't we be in there?

283
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,467
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

284
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,061
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

285
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:16,367
he'll only dump on us.

286
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:18,841
lf the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. l've seen him work.

Can you get that for me?
l guess it is, isn't it?

289
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,311
That's the one thing l learned
from Grossman,

290
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:26,646
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

291
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:29,117
-How do you mean?
-Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

292
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:33,317
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,689
-Told you, you could handle this.
-Yeah.

-They sent me out here!
-Now!

-He said stay away!
-Cuff him.

-Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

Was it a time when l thought
l might not see my family again? Yeah.

319
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:09,813
Yeah, l thought about it.
l mean, at first, l wasn't...

320
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,321
lt was too much to think about at that point.

Yeah.

my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

And no business with your uncle?

335

ln truth, l have very little
to do with him these days.

336
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:03,723
l'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
ls that right?

l have a Mr. Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

We'll need to end this here.

-He said his name, just like that?

l'll come right to the point.

l have a small problem
which requires someone

359
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:15,135
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

360
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:19,036
Are you such a person
or have l been misinformed?

-l'll be downstairs.
-Thank you.

364
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:36,059
They had a kind of genius plan

365
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:38,652
for throwing us out of whack

366
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:43,132
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

367
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,293
They were... They were very

368
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:50,865
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

369
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:54,843
All l know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

370
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:58,007
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

371
00:27:58,082 --> 00:27:59,310
And they called you what?

372
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:01,374
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

373
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:04,546
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

374
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:06,487
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

375
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,185
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

376
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,023
-You know a lot about guns.
-No.

377
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:14,064
-l don't know anything about guns, except...
-But you know they had an AK-47.

378
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:17,191
-Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
-Everybody?

379
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:21,204
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

380
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:23,900
-You ever rob a bank before?
-Are you kidding?

381
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:26,670
Me rob a bank? No.

382
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:28,902
-Never stole a dollar?
-Never.

383
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:31,277
-Never?
-Not ever.

384
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:34,442
-You know what?
-That one time. That one time, that one time.

385
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:37,976
l stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

386
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:41,181
She was Polish.

387
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:46,092
l used to go up to her and say,
''Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. ''

388
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:52,225
One day, l opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

389
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:53,668
l took it.

390
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:56,166
That was the only thing l ever took.

391
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,843
Look, Detective, l didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

392
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:05,108
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

393
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:08,948
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

394
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,419
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

395
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:15,015
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

396
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:17,424
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

397
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:21,396
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

398
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,801
There's a video system in the bank.

399
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:26,796
We're working on getting a download

400
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:30,272
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

401
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:33,708
We got the block locked up.
l got men in the windows.

402
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:36,507
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

403
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,911
What about the phones?

404
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:41,884
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

405
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:46,680
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

406
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:49,988
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

407
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,221
but so far nothing.

408
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,255
-91 1?
-lt's up on the screen.

409
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:58,358
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

410
00:29:58,602 --> 00:30:02,231
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

411
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:04,499
Yeah.

412
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:07,508
Yeah, l'm not calling them yet.

413
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:09,170
Beg your pardon?

414
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:11,541
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what l mean?

415
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,515
l'm not gonna call him
and ask what l can do for him.

416
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:15,347
Let's see what he does.

417
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,851
Your call.

418
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:28,558
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how l work?

419
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:30,600
Please. That would be nice.

420
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:35,667
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

421
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:37,138
That's fine.

422
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:40,904
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

423
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:42,445
that handle these kinds of things.

424
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:45,482
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

425
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:47,346
Their people call me.

426
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:50,610
So, immediately, l know
that there's something in that box

427
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:53,987
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

428
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:56,452
No problem with me.

429
00:30:56,527 --> 00:31:00,691
You tell me l don't need to know
what's in that box and l don't need to know.

430
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:03,665
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

431
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:07,693
and l find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

432
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:11,503
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

433
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,543
-Have you finished?
-Yes.

434
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:15,870
What's inside that box, young lady,

435
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:18,676
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

436
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:22,946
lt's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

437
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:24,852
Except you.

438
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,488
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

439
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,391
so l can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

440
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,191
-Of course.
-All right.

441
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:36,198
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

442
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:37,494
l don't.

443
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:42,298
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

444
00:31:43,974 --> 00:31:48,911
l'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

445
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,977
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

446
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,916
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier l'll be.

447
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:57,681
-ls that specific enough for you?
-No.

448
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,258
The contents of that box

449
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:06,519
are of great value to me.

450
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,958
So long as they remain my secret.

451
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:11,934
And if they're exposed?

452
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:22,869
l'll face some difficult questions.

453
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:26,312
-So, it stays locked or it disappears.
-Precisely.

454
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:28,681
-Can you make that happen?
-Yes.

455
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:32,119
l hope so.
l have to say, l can't help but be skeptical.

456
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:35,124
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

457
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:37,988
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

458
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,029
Steve?

459
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:49,269
lt's time for Steve-O.

460
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,106
l came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

461
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,548
Guess what l found?

462
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:04,053
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

463
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:05,213
Yeah.

464
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:17,090
Probably stolen.

465
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,635
Have them run it and check it for prints.

466
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:27,110
-Everybody on?
-Yep, l'm there.

467
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:29,841
(TELEPHONE RlNGlNG)

468
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:41,256
-Sure you got the right number?
-Absolutely.

469
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:53,330
Okay. Nothing yet.

470
00:33:56,073 --> 00:33:57,301
We got video.

471
00:33:57,374 --> 00:33:58,773
Let's have it.

472
00:34:01,578 --> 00:34:03,546
FRAZlER: What happened to that camera
right there?

473
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:05,946
ROURKE: Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

474
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:11,445
FRAZlER: Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

475
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:14,855
lt's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

476
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:17,450
lt's weird, isn't it?
lt's like nobody else sees it.

477
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:20,361
-You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
-lt could be infrared.

478
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,557
-What's that?
-lnfrared bulb.

479
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:25,627
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

480
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,727
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

481
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:29,032
FRAZlER: Right, right, right, right.

482
00:34:29,106 --> 00:34:30,903
ROURKE: He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

483
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:33,101
So, for approximately two minutes,

484
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:36,908
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

485
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,006
MlTCHELL: Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

486
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,607
lt was just a few minutes.

487
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:44,848
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

488
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:49,256
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

489
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:52,318
And then l just remember one of them

490
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:55,160
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

491
00:34:55,232 --> 00:34:57,097
-The video cameras?
-I don't know.

492
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:59,226
Anything else you want to share with us?

493
00:34:59,303 --> 00:35:00,361
No, just...

494
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:02,234
-You sure?
-Yeah, l...

495
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:05,398
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

496
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:07,466
l'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

497
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:08,943
-You okay?
-Thank you.

498
00:35:09,012 --> 00:35:10,104
Okay.

499
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,181
-lt was pretty awful.
-Was it bad?

500
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:14,410
l mean, they made us strip.

501
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:17,486
They made us take off our clothes.

502
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:21,920
l don't understand why they had to do that.

503
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,516
l really just thought...

504
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:25,926
l thought l was gonna be killed.

505
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:27,789
Well.

506
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,925
-All right, my dear.
-Okay.

507
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,465
-l can go?
-No.

508
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:36,233
-No?
-No, you got to stay.

509
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:37,796
-You got to stay.
-No, you can go.

510
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:40,069
No, stay. No, go.

511
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,701
Did you rob the bank?

512
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:43,040
-You did.
-Did you rob the bank?

513
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:44,580
-No.
-You sure?

514
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:47,346
-BERK: There's movement at the front door.
-Let's go.

515
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:53,813
HERNANDEZ: Put down the fucking weapon!
VlKRAM: Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

516
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,755
HERNANDEZ: Don't move! Don't move!

517
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:57,157
COP: He's got a device on him there.

518
00:35:57,227 --> 00:36:00,458
l said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

519
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,294
l said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

520
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:04,800
COP: Hands are tied!
HERNANDEZ: Hands are tied.

521
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:07,029
-Jesus, pat him down.
-All right.

522
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:09,004
-VlKRAM: l'm one of the hostages!
-Careful.

523
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:10,437
HERNANDEZ: Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

524
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:11,940
SNlPER 1 : l can't see him from where l'm at.

525
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:14,807
SNlPER 2: l can see him. l got a clear shot.
HERNANDEZ: Any weapons?

526
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:17,409
-Who are you?
-Vikram Walia. l work in the bank.

527
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:19,642
Okay. Vikram? ls this a bomb?

528
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:21,980
-Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
-What? No. l'm a Sikh!

529
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:23,110
-ls that a bomb?
-No.

530
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:24,346
-Answer me, Vikram. ls this a bomb?
-No.

531
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:25,820
-Are you booby-trapped?
-No, fuck, no.

532
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,550
Okay, Vikram, l need you to relax.

533
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:30,252
-Jesus, give me a hand.
-l don't know.

534
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:32,386
SNlPER 1 : Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

535
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:33,929
-Team, take him down.
-Mike, now, get him.

536
00:36:33,997 --> 00:36:35,430
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

537
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:38,161
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

538
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:41,768
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

539
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:43,203
Come on, shut up. Relax.

540
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,138
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

541
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,903
-You can't fucking rip my turban.
-Shut up, already.

542
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,137
-What the fuck?
-Come on, move it.

543
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:50,145
Get your fucking hands off me!

544
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,278
And the 1 1 :00 and 1 2:00...

545
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:59,481
And don't forget about your 1 :00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

546
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:01,922
-Oh, Madge. What a day...
-Your Honor.

547
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:03,721
Madeleine! How are you?

548
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:06,354
l'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

549
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,695
-Sure. Madge, are we through here?
-Yes, Mr. Mayor.

550
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,763
This way, Miss White.

551
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:16,702
l always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

552
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:18,638
Who are we saving this week?

553
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,472
Well, l'm doing a round of support

554
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:23,479
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

555
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,606
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

556
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:27,650
lf you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

557
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:31,654
lt would be my pleasure.
ls there anything else l can do to...

558
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:34,754
-What the fuck do you want?
-A favor.

559
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:38,659
-No shit. Which kind?
-The last one l'll ever ask of you.

560
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,392
That's the kind l had in mind.

561
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:44,032
You know about this hostage situation.

562
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:46,331
On my way. What's it to do with you?

563
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:48,530
All right, well, l need to keep an eye on it.

564
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:51,631
So, l want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

565
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,699
to extend me every courtesy.

566
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,912
You're out of your fucking mind.

567
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:02,213
lf it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

568
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:05,649
-lt's impossible.
-Nothing's impossible.

569
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,883
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

570
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,153
l may have to give out a few.

571
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:13,285
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

572
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:16,689
You're a magnificent cunt.

573
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,401
Thank you.

574
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:28,439
It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.

575
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:30,878
It's unclear how many hostages are inside

576
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:33,381
and how many robbers
police are dealing with.

577
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,715
Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,

578
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:39,688
but has turned into this hostage situation.

579
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:42,554
Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard

580
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:45,288
and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.

581
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,626
Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest

582
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:50,666
and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.

583
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:52,668
That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.

584
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:55,466
Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.

585
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,474
VlKRAM: ''Protect and serve'' my ass.
Where's my turban?

586
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:01,000
l'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

587
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:04,171
lt's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. l'm a Sikh.

588
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:05,544
MlTCHELL: Okay, we'll find your turban.

589
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:07,913
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

590
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:10,009
Now, no, l don't think you heard that.

591
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:12,418
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

592
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:14,457
-l didn't hear that.
-l heard what l heard.

593
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:16,617
l'll give you all the information you want.

594
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:19,594
l don't need this. l need my turban.
lt's part of my religion.

595
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:21,722
-We'll get you your turban.
-We'll find it for you.

596
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:24,232
No, no, no. Not ''get me.''
l want my turban now.

597
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:27,031
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

598
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,161
lt's a dangerous situation.

599
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:30,706
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

600
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:33,208
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

601
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:34,743
You can write a formal complaint.

602
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:37,177
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

603
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:39,306
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

604
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:42,044
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

605
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:45,679
l could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,

l make First Grade when l make First Grade.

911
00:59:58,549 --> 01:00:01,382
You want to speed that up,
l'm not gonna talk you out of it.

912
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:04,853
Then there's also the matter of $1 40,000
that seems to have walked away

913
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:06,787
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

914
01:00:06,858 --> 01:00:08,052
Oh, l see.

915
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,287
Well, l had nothing to do with that.

916
01:00:12,764 --> 01:00:15,096
HERNANDEZ: Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

917
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,828
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

918
01:00:17,935 --> 01:00:20,028
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

919
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:22,902
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

920
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:29,577
DALTON: Well?
FRAZlER: ls this the President of Albania?

921
01:00:29,981 --> 01:00:31,812
-Speaking.
-Pretty funny.

922
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:35,075
-You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
-Well, you better get used to it, pal.

923
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:37,178
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

924
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:38,415
You're damn right.

925
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:41,583
This time next week,
l'll be sucking down pina coladas

926
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:44,526
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

927
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:47,925
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

928
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,559
if you know what l mean.
And here's the bad news,

929
01:00:50,635 --> 01:00:53,763
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a pina colada.

930
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:59,735
-Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
-You really want to piss me off.

931
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:01,542
All right, here's where we stand.

932
01:01:01,612 --> 01:01:04,376
l don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

933
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:06,040

934
01:01:06,117 --> 01:01:08,483
-Sure, sure. l just meant...
-Here's where things stand.

935
01:01:08,553 --> 01:01:10,384
You're getting me what l asked you for.

936
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:12,354
You'll have it ready in the time l gave you

937
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:15,722
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what l said l would do. Clear?

938
01:01:15,793 --> 01:01:17,658
Very clear.
l'm trying to get you what you want.

939
01:01:17,728 --> 01:01:19,127
But you got to understand this.

940
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:23,498
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 7 47 s waiting around for days like today.

941
01:01:23,568 --> 01:01:25,934
l understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

942
01:01:26,003 --> 01:01:28,130
-then you might as well send a hearse.
-Please.

943
01:01:28,472 --> 01:01:30,906
Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?

944
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:33,409
Hey! You're not listening.

945
01:01:35,246 --> 01:01:38,875
You get me what l want, l won't kill anyone.

946
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:41,351
All right. l'm on it. l'm on it.

947
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,519
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

948
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:47,387
-Don't l sound calm to you?
-Yeah, you do.

-Damerjian.

951
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:50,712
-Damerjian. ls that Albanian?
-Just call me Kenneth.

952
01:02:50,788 --> 01:02:53,018
-Kenneth?
-ls that Albanian or...

953
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:54,614
lt's Armenian.

954
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,792
What's the difference?

955
01:02:57,561 --> 01:02:59,552
Detective, l was born in Queens.

956
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:03,762
l've never been to Armenia, Albania.
l went surfing in Australia once.

957
01:03:03,834 --> 01:03:05,426
Can l have a glass of water?

958
01:03:05,503 --> 01:03:07,869
-Are you thirsty?
-My throat's parched.

959
01:03:07,939 --> 01:03:09,566
-l'm not nervous.
-Your throat's parched?

960
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,403
-My throat's parched.
-His throat is parched.

961
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:13,306
-l just want a glass of water.
-Oh, shit!

962
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:16,443
When you start telling us
what really happened...

963
01:03:16,514 --> 01:03:18,379
-l just want a glass of water.
-His throat is parched.

964
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:20,110
-Here. You want some coffee?
-No, that's all right.

965
01:03:20,184 --> 01:03:21,446
-l don't drink that stuff.
-No, go ahead.

966
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:22,679
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

967
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:24,948
l didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

968
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:26,512
ls that why you held the door open
for them?

How do you know they robbed the bank?

970
01:03:27,825 --> 01:03:29,122
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

971
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:30,524
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

972
01:03:30,594 --> 01:03:32,255
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

973
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:35,959
l was in a bank and l was locked up
for who knows how long.

974
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:38,763
-Okay.
-Tied up in a room. l saw you see me.

975
01:03:38,836 --> 01:03:40,201
You saw me see you?

976
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:41,636
-ls that what you just said?
-Yeah.

977
01:03:41,706 --> 01:03:44,106
l was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

978
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:46,803
Listen, l can't work miracles over here.
l'm gonna need more time.

979
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:49,675
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that l gave you more efficiently,

980
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:51,271
you wouldn't be having this problem.

981
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:53,943
-What do you want me to say?
-That my plane is ready.

982
01:03:54,752 --> 01:03:56,219
Okay, listen.

983
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:01,084
l promise you, as God is my witness,
l'm working on it as hard as l can.

984
01:04:01,192 --> 01:04:02,955
lt's just gonna take a few more hours.

985
01:04:03,027 --> 01:04:04,517
Why should l give you any more time?

986
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:06,927
Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.

987
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:09,091
You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.

988
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:11,031
You got nothing to lose.

989
01:04:13,537 --> 01:04:15,664
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

990
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,538
l got a question for you.
You get it right, l give you more time.

991
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,134
-And?
-You know what happens if you don't.

Which weighs more?

993
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:29,181
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

994
01:04:30,354 --> 01:04:33,881
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

995
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,949
Here's a hint. lt's a trick question.

-Yeah, that's right.

1000

-So no trees were cut down.

1001

-Are you sure?
-Yeah. 100%.

01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:21,552
lt's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1057
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:25,083
-No, no. How you doing?
-l'm doing okay. l'm doing all right.

1058
01:07:25,162 --> 01:07:28,893
Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

1059
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,593
-You saw me on TV?
-Yeah.

1060
01:07:30,668 --> 01:07:33,159
-How'd l look?
-You looked good, baby. Real good.

1061
01:07:33,237 --> 01:07:35,899
-All right, listen. l got to go.
-All right. Hey.

1062
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,865
-Keep your head down.
-All right, l will. Love you.

1063
01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:41,772
Come on.

1064
01:07:44,715 --> 01:07:47,240
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1065
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:50,718
-There's no need to worry, Detective.
-l get paid to worry, okay?

1066
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:52,415
l just need you to look me in the eye

1067
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:56,152
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

1068
01:07:56,227 --> 01:07:57,888
-l understand.
-Okay.

1069
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:04,967
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1070
01:08:07,471 --> 01:08:08,961
-Hello?
-Who is this?

1071
01:08:09,106 --> 01:08:11,097
Let's not get into any names.

1072
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:13,609
-What matters is what l can offer you.
-And what's that?

1073
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:16,168
Well, if l can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

1074
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:18,442
l might be able to help you get
what you came for.

1075
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:19,811
l doubt that.

1076
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:23,920
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1077
01:08:23,988 --> 01:08:25,649
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1078
01:08:25,723 --> 01:08:29,250
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

1079
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,394
-Rich, of course.
-Of course.

1080
01:08:31,462 --> 01:08:33,896
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1081
01:08:33,964 --> 01:08:36,831
-How?
-l can't discuss that on the phone.

1082
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:39,160
-You work for the bank?
-No.

1083
01:08:39,803 --> 01:08:41,464
And you're not a cop.

1084
01:08:41,905 --> 01:08:43,270
That's right.

1085
01:08:44,975 --> 01:08:46,340
Come on in.

1086
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:55,108
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1087
01:08:55,185 --> 01:08:56,948
lf you're not out
before the lights come back on,

1088
01:08:57,021 --> 01:08:58,613
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1089
01:08:58,689 --> 01:09:01,157
-You don't need to threaten me.
-That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1090
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:04,353
l know this game is a mile over my head,
but l'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1091
01:09:04,428 --> 01:09:06,589
l got where l am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

1092
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:08,188
Trust me, okay?

1093
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:10,432
You're on your own.

1094
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,157
DALTON: What makes you think
l need help?

1095
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,996
MADELElNE: Well,
the hundred people outside, for starters.

1096
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,463
DALTON: lt's not a problem.

1097
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:46,025
MADELElNE: And they're fueling
your jet right now as we speak.

1098
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:49,371
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1099
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:52,168
Here's what l'm thinking.

1100
01:09:52,409 --> 01:09:54,969
lf you give up now,
l can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1101
01:09:55,045 --> 01:09:57,240
l'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1102
01:09:57,314 --> 01:09:58,406
You can arrange that?

1103
01:09:58,482 --> 01:10:00,541
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

1104
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:02,812
so yes, as a matter of fact, l can.

1105
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:05,888
-lt's not good enough.
-Well, l wasn't finished.

1106
01:10:06,523 --> 01:10:09,424
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1107
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:11,991
Will l? How?

1108
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:15,259
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

1109
01:10:15,264 --> 01:10:16,492
Thanks.

1110
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:18,824
But no, thanks.

1111
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:22,132
Oh, come on. l made you such a sweet offer.

1112
01:10:22,204 --> 01:10:24,604
l really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1113
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:28,667
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1114
01:10:28,778 --> 01:10:30,439
-l'm afraid l can't.
-l can.

1115
01:10:30,513 --> 01:10:32,105
Let me tell you a story.

1116
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,880
During World War ll, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1117
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:42,814
DALTON: Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history

1118
01:10:42,892 --> 01:10:45,793
was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.

1119
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:47,829
People like this man.

1120
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:52,663
He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him

1121
01:10:52,735 --> 01:10:55,295
people were being stripped
of everything they owned.

1122
01:10:56,806 --> 01:11:00,833
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1123
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:01,934
Now,

1124
01:11:03,646 --> 01:11:06,479
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1125
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:09,907
Or am l just whistling Dixie out of my ass?

1126
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:12,881
-l believe we understand each other.
-Good.

1127
01:11:14,757 --> 01:11:16,657
So, what the hell can you do for me

1128
01:11:16,726 --> 01:11:20,423
since l clearly know more than you do,
and l've planned this to perfection?

1129
01:11:20,496 --> 01:11:24,728
Believe me, if l need to,
l can change your entire program.

1130
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,893
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1131
01:11:26,969 --> 01:11:30,461
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1132
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:33,068
-What is it you want?
-Two minutes.

1133
01:11:33,142 --> 01:11:35,940
The safety deposit box room.
l just need to go to one box.

1134
01:11:38,314 --> 01:11:39,838
Looking for this?

1135
01:11:41,217 --> 01:11:43,845
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1136
01:11:44,653 --> 01:11:46,814
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1137
01:11:46,889 --> 01:11:48,880
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1138
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:54,262
Now, if the day ever comes
where l have to stand before a judge

1139
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,230
and account for what l did here,

1140
01:11:56,298 --> 01:11:58,664
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

1141
01:12:00,469 --> 01:12:02,596
You get out of here with that envelope,

1142
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:05,465
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1143
01:12:05,908 --> 01:12:07,170
l'll keep that in mind.

1144
01:12:07,243 --> 01:12:10,178
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1145
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,079
l'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1146
01:12:13,582 --> 01:12:16,210
-How did you know about all this?
-Doesn't matter.

1147
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:19,721
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1148
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:23,386
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

1149
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:25,890
-Murder will out?
-Precisely.

1150
01:12:26,796 --> 01:12:29,128
Well, l still don't get what you're
doing here.

1151
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:30,290
Really?

1152
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:32,858
DALTON: Good.

1153
01:12:37,373 --> 01:12:38,499
So, we spoke.

1154
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:40,303
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1155
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:42,037
-Let me have this window, fellows.
-Yes, sir.

1156
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:44,944
l told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1157
01:12:45,014 --> 01:12:47,983
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1158
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:49,108
And?

1159
01:12:49,852 --> 01:12:51,752
And that was basically it.

1160
01:12:53,088 --> 01:12:55,147
You know, l don't ordinarily get offended

1161
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:58,455
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1162
01:12:58,527 --> 01:13:02,122
Now, l know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

1163
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:03,529
Talk to me.

1164
01:13:04,066 --> 01:13:05,158
Look, Detective.

1165
01:13:05,234 --> 01:13:07,725
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1166
01:13:07,803 --> 01:13:09,600
l say it does, okay?

1167
01:13:09,972 --> 01:13:11,371
Okay, you don't own me.

1168
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,637
This check-cashing thing, this coke bust,
l can face that on my own.

1169
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:17,235
l know what l did and what l didn't do.

1170
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:19,781
-Talk to me.
-Off the record?

1171
01:13:19,849 --> 01:13:23,341
''Off the...'' Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1172
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:26,212
-Well, l gave him an incentive.
-Okay.

1173
01:13:26,589 --> 01:13:30,616
-Did he go for it?
-No. But l'd say he's considering it.

1174
01:13:31,961 --> 01:13:33,656
He's smart, isn't he?

1175
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:35,591
-He thinks he is.
-Yeah.

1176
01:13:36,098 --> 01:13:38,692
One of your types, like the lvy League type?

1177
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:41,769
-Clearly well educated.
-That's what l'm talking about.

1178
01:13:42,071 --> 01:13:43,971
That's exactly what l'm talking about.

1179
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:48,006
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1180
01:13:49,879 --> 01:13:52,279
-Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
-How do you know?

1181
01:13:52,348 --> 01:13:54,646
-Because he's not a murderer.
-How do you know?

1182
01:13:55,217 --> 01:13:57,378
l got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1183
01:13:57,453 --> 01:13:59,182
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1184
01:13:59,255 --> 01:14:02,452
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1185
01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:05,926
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1186
01:14:05,995 --> 01:14:09,396
lt doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1187
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,297
You're right.

1188
01:14:13,302 --> 01:14:14,860
So, you through?

1189
01:14:15,905 --> 01:14:18,169
-l guess. Are you saying l'm dismissed?
-Yes, l am.

1190
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,333
You got a card, in case l need to call you?

1191
01:14:21,443 --> 01:14:24,344
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1192
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:26,105
l don't think you can afford me.

1193
01:14:26,181 --> 01:14:29,617
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1194
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,517
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

1195
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:42,622
-So, how old are you, Brian?
-Eight and three-quarters.

1196
01:14:42,698 --> 01:14:45,292
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1197
01:14:46,502 --> 01:14:48,629
-Were you scared in there?
-No.

1198
01:14:48,704 --> 01:14:51,366
-No? Not at all, huh?
-Nope. l'm from Brooklyn.

1199
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,067
You're from Brooklyn, huh? l understand.

1200
01:14:53,142 --> 01:14:54,837
-Guns don't scare me.
-They don't scare you?

1201
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,343
-Brave, too, huh?
-Yeah.

1202

They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

So, lay it out for me.

1631
01:42:15,849 --> 01:42:18,409
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1632
01:42:18,485 --> 01:42:21,352
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

1633
01:42:21,422 --> 01:42:24,823
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1634
01:42:25,659 --> 01:42:29,095
We ask them if they could recognize
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1635
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:31,825
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1636
01:42:31,932 --> 01:42:34,662
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

lt's like the thing never happened.

-What about prints?
-Everywhere. So what?

1639
01:42:39,873 --> 01:42:43,400
-All it shows is that these people were there.
-Alibis?

1640
01:42:43,477 --> 01:42:44,842
Just about everyone.

1641
01:42:44,912 --> 01:42:46,812
Even if their alibi was weak,

1642
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,940
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1643
01:42:50,017 --> 01:42:51,575
There we are, back to square one.

1644
01:42:51,652 --> 01:42:52,676

1645
01:42:52,753 --> 01:42:56,245
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1646

Excuse me.

1647
01:42:58,192 --> 01:43:00,854
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1648
01:43:00,928 --> 01:43:03,658
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. mostly.

1649
01:43:04,698 --> 01:43:07,667
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1650
01:43:07,735 --> 01:43:09,760
-Bank cameras?
-Useless.

1651
01:43:09,837 --> 01:43:12,271
l'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1652
01:43:12,339 --> 01:43:14,671
-Sounded like everything to me.
-But this.

or the perp that was holding it.

-No shit.

also the matter of the $140,000

in your corner on that.

1700
01:45:47,194 --> 01:45:50,061
In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?

1701
01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:52,098
I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse

to be in my corner, Mr. Mayor.

she needs, or your career is over.

Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

1710
01:46:14,221 --> 01:46:15,745
What was Case hiding?

1711
01:46:18,926 --> 01:46:22,384
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1712
01:46:24,131 --> 01:46:27,328
''When there's blood on the streets,
buy property.''

1713
01:46:29,803 --> 01:46:32,829
l think Mr. Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1714
01:46:32,906 --> 01:46:35,704
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1715
01:46:37,177 --> 01:46:38,940
Let it go, Detective.

1716

You're a good cop.

This city needs you.

-Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
-l have an appointment.

(CASE CLEARlNG THROAT)

1724
01:47:39,806 --> 01:47:42,001
Well. What did he say?

1725
01:47:42,075 --> 01:47:45,101
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1726
01:47:45,178 --> 01:47:48,341
But l just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

1727
01:47:48,415 --> 01:47:51,384
l hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1728
01:47:51,818 --> 01:47:52,978
Where is it now?

1729
01:47:53,053 --> 01:47:55,954
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

1730
01:47:56,023 --> 01:47:59,151
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

1731
01:47:59,826 --> 01:48:02,590
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1732
01:48:02,663 --> 01:48:03,994
And what might that be?

1733
01:48:04,064 --> 01:48:07,363
Well, let's see.
ln a nutshell, that you got rich,

1734
01:48:07,568 --> 01:48:10,662
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

1735
01:48:13,941 --> 01:48:15,033
Yes.

1736
01:48:16,243 --> 01:48:19,337
lt was 60 years ago.
l was young and ambitious.

1737
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:22,778
l saw a short path to success and l took it.

1738
01:48:24,384 --> 01:48:25,908
l sold my soul.

1739
01:48:27,688 --> 01:48:30,680
And l've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

1740
01:48:30,757 --> 01:48:35,251
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1741
01:48:35,429 --> 01:48:39,263
l think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

1742
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:43,633
lf someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1743
01:48:44,471 --> 01:48:47,167
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1744
01:48:48,442 --> 01:48:50,501
-So, l guess that's it.
-l suppose so.

1745
01:48:50,577 --> 01:48:52,477
-Bullshit.
-l beg your pardon?

1746
01:48:52,546 --> 01:48:56,414
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1747
01:48:56,483 --> 01:48:59,316
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1748
01:48:59,386 --> 01:49:00,444
So?

1749
01:49:00,587 --> 01:49:04,990
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1750
01:49:05,959 --> 01:49:08,450
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

1751
01:49:08,528 --> 01:49:11,122
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1752
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:13,826
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

1753
01:49:15,836 --> 01:49:17,827
You don't have to tell me.

1754
01:49:17,904 --> 01:49:20,304
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1755
01:49:23,677 --> 01:49:24,837
Diamonds.

1756
01:49:25,779 --> 01:49:27,644
And then there's the ring.

1757
01:49:28,348 --> 01:49:29,747
Cartier ring.

1758
01:49:30,384 --> 01:49:33,353
lt belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1759
01:49:33,754 --> 01:49:36,416
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1760
01:49:37,090 --> 01:49:40,218
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

1761
01:49:40,293 --> 01:49:45,128
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1762
01:49:47,134 --> 01:49:48,761
We were friends.

1763
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:51,467
l could have helped them.

1764
01:49:53,407 --> 01:49:58,208
But the Nazis paid too well.

The ''where'' could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

1779
01:51:11,618 --> 01:51:13,210
But there is a vast difference

1780
01:51:13,286 --> 01:51:16,813
between being stuck in a tiny cell

That's also the ''when.''

As for the ''why, ''
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

it's exceedingly simple.

Which leaves us only with the ''how. ''

01:54:12,365 --> 01:54:13,923
Just like he planned.

1806
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,594
l got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

1807
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:18,604
Number 392.

1808
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,872
(STEVE-O SlGHlNG)

1809
01:54:29,816 --> 01:54:31,579
STEVE-O: Oh, thank God.

1810
01:54:37,324 --> 01:54:38,723
Where is it?

1811
01:54:39,492 --> 01:54:40,959
l left it in there.

1812
01:54:41,027 --> 01:54:42,722
This way, Detectives.

1813
01:54:42,796 --> 01:54:45,390
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1814
01:54:45,465 --> 01:54:46,727
Trust me.

1815
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:49,328
l left it in good hands.

1816
01:54:50,236 --> 01:54:51,828
DALTON: I'm no martyr.

1817
01:54:52,539 --> 01:54:54,166
I did it for the money.

1818
01:54:55,976 --> 01:54:59,503
But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.

1819
01:55:00,447 --> 01:55:03,075
Respect is the ultimate currency.

1820
01:55:05,919 --> 01:55:09,855
I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.

1821
01:55:11,758 --> 01:55:14,226
And then he tried to wash away his guilt.

1822
01:55:15,362 --> 01:55:19,389
Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.

1823
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,327
-Let me get that.
-Let me.

1824
01:55:22,402 --> 01:55:23,801
It almost worked, too.

1825
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:24,996
Okay.

1826
01:55:27,073 --> 01:55:28,472
But inevitably,

1827
01:55:29,409 --> 01:55:31,604
the further you run from your sins,

1828
01:55:32,412 --> 01:55:35,381
the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.

1829
01:55:35,715 --> 01:55:36,875
And they do.

1830
01:55:38,785 --> 01:55:40,309
Son of a bitch.

1831
01:55:40,387 --> 01:55:41,581
Certain.

1832
01:55:42,589 --> 01:55:44,250
It will not fail.

1833
01:55:48,661 --> 01:55:50,652
FRAZlER: What do you think that's worth?

1834
01:55:50,930 --> 01:55:53,592
(CHUCKLlNG) lf you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

1835
01:55:53,666 --> 01:55:56,066
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1836
01:55:58,171 --> 01:55:59,968
''Follow the ring''?

1837
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:16,955
-Detective Frazier.
-Mr. Case.

1838
01:56:17,157 --> 01:56:19,125
-How are you?
-l am great.

1839
01:56:19,559 --> 01:56:22,960
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1840
01:56:23,029 --> 01:56:25,020
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1841
01:56:25,098 --> 01:56:26,827
-Detective Mitchell.
-Mr. Case.

1842
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,868
-Be seated, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

1843
01:56:28,935 --> 01:56:31,233
-Can l offer you anything?
-No.

1844
01:56:31,304 --> 01:56:32,896
l must say

1845
01:56:33,273 --> 01:56:35,707
l was most impressed

1846
01:56:36,876 --> 01:56:38,776
by the way you handled that business.

1847
01:56:38,845 --> 01:56:40,176
Thank you, Mr. Case.

1848
01:56:40,246 --> 01:56:42,180
Whenever l hear the term
''New York's Finest''

1849
01:56:42,248 --> 01:56:43,977
you're who l think of.

1850
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:47,315
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1851
01:56:49,622 --> 01:56:51,988
-Pardon me.
-Well, what's so amusing?

1852
01:56:52,058 --> 01:56:55,027
When you say ''the rest of us,'' Mr. Case,
l mean, you got to look around.

1853
01:56:55,095 --> 01:56:59,156
''The rest of us'' is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1854
01:56:59,232 --> 01:57:01,962
Touche, Detective.
l won't deny it. l've done well.

1855
01:57:02,035 --> 01:57:04,196
Yes, you have. But l'm very confused.

1856
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:06,033
You see, l got a case

1857
01:57:06,773 --> 01:57:09,742
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1858
01:57:09,809 --> 01:57:11,140
lt is your bank, right?

1859
01:57:11,211 --> 01:57:13,111
Well, l'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1860
01:57:13,179 --> 01:57:14,874
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1861
01:57:14,948 --> 01:57:16,882
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1862
01:57:17,217 --> 01:57:18,616
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1863
01:57:18,685 --> 01:57:21,017
-You're asking me?
-Yes, l'm asking you.

1864
01:57:21,087 --> 01:57:23,282
l mean, it's your bank. You own it.
l'm asking you.

1865
01:57:23,356 --> 01:57:25,256
lt's a tiny part of our organization.

1866
01:57:25,325 --> 01:57:27,452
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1867
01:57:27,527 --> 01:57:29,620
lt's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1868
01:57:29,696 --> 01:57:30,856
l never heard of it before.

1869
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:33,990
So, you got to ask yourself, ''What the fuck
happened?'' Don't you, Mr. Case?

1870
01:57:34,067 --> 01:57:35,694
l'm not quite sure l like your tone, Officer.

1871
01:57:35,768 --> 01:57:38,134
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1872
01:57:38,204 --> 01:57:42,038
lt's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. lt's your baby.

1873
01:57:42,108 --> 01:57:44,167
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1874
01:57:44,244 --> 01:57:47,873
-l have no idea.
-Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1875
01:57:47,947 --> 01:57:49,380
l'll tell you what l think happened.

1876
01:57:49,449 --> 01:57:51,610
l think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

1877
01:57:51,684 --> 01:57:54,209
Miss White. l think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1878
01:57:54,287 --> 01:57:55,777
Look, this is absurd.

1879
01:57:55,855 --> 01:57:57,823
Are you implying that
l had anything to do with it?

1880
01:57:57,891 --> 01:57:59,518
392.

1881
01:58:00,059 --> 01:58:02,550
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1882
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:05,029
-l have no idea what you're...
-Don't lie to me, Mr. Case.

1883
01:58:05,098 --> 01:58:07,589
-l don't lie.
-l looked at all the records.

1884
01:58:07,667 --> 01:58:11,228
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1885
01:58:11,404 --> 01:58:14,100
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1886
01:58:14,874 --> 01:58:17,206
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1887
01:58:17,277 --> 01:58:19,245
l mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1888
01:58:19,312 --> 01:58:22,475
So l started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1889
01:58:22,549 --> 01:58:24,414
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1890
01:58:24,484 --> 01:58:26,816
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

1891
01:58:26,886 --> 01:58:29,616
lt doesn't add up, Mr. Case.
lt does not add up.

1892
01:58:30,657 --> 01:58:34,991
l'm afraid l can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

1893
01:58:36,129 --> 01:58:38,654
lt's something really bad, isn't it?

1894
01:58:39,365 --> 01:58:43,995
Mr. Frazier, l have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

1895
01:58:45,438 --> 01:58:47,497
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1896
01:58:48,775 --> 01:58:51,767
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that l've done.

1897
01:58:51,844 --> 01:58:54,904
You think they'll vouch for you
after l find out the truth about this ring?

1898
01:58:54,981 --> 01:58:56,380
l don't think so.

1899
01:59:01,054 --> 01:59:04,080
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1900
01:59:04,157 --> 01:59:06,785
l want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

1901
01:59:07,427 --> 01:59:08,758
How gracious.

1902
01:59:09,596 --> 01:59:12,258
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1903
01:59:19,272 --> 01:59:21,832
-Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
-What?

1904
01:59:21,908 --> 01:59:24,308
-Let me see your shoe.
-Why?

1905
01:59:24,377 --> 01:59:27,608
'Cause l have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1906
01:59:30,516 --> 01:59:32,211
Yeah, l guess l did, didn't l?

1907
01:59:32,285 --> 01:59:34,879
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1908
01:59:34,954 --> 01:59:37,286
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1909
01:59:46,199 --> 01:59:47,393
Good afternoon, sir.

1910
01:59:47,467 --> 01:59:49,367
-Do you have a reservation?
-Looking for the Mayor.

1911
01:59:49,435 --> 01:59:51,426
-May l have your hat, please?
-No, you cannot. Get your own.

1912
01:59:51,504 --> 01:59:54,098
MADELElNE: They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1913
01:59:54,173 --> 01:59:55,299
And that's all in place.

1914
01:59:55,408 --> 01:59:58,377
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1915
01:59:58,444 --> 02:00:02,210
''When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail.''

1916
02:00:02,882 --> 02:00:05,908
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

1917
02:00:07,987 --> 02:00:09,579
MAYOR: What's this about, Detective?

1918
02:00:09,656 --> 02:00:13,183
l believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1919
02:00:13,526 --> 02:00:15,790
That's a good word. Closure.

1920
02:00:15,862 --> 02:00:18,456
Case closed, you know what l mean?

1921
02:00:18,531 --> 02:00:19,862
This is the number

1922
02:00:19,932 --> 02:00:23,993
of the War Crimes lssues office
in Washington, D.C.

1923
02:00:25,638 --> 02:00:28,232
How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?

1924
02:00:28,308 --> 02:00:29,434
That'd be great.

1925
02:00:29,509 --> 02:00:32,842
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a ''z''.

1926
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:35,504
You can keep the pen.

1927
02:00:36,215 --> 02:00:37,705
You made copies?

1928
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:40,513
Please.

1929
02:00:40,953 --> 02:00:44,354
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honor.

1930
02:00:45,825 --> 02:00:48,487
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1931
02:00:52,865 --> 02:00:54,423
War crimes, huh?

1932
02:00:55,234 --> 02:00:57,464
What have you got me into this time?

1933
02:01:04,711 --> 02:01:05,939
(SNORlNG SOFTLY)

1934
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:18,148
Mama?

1935
02:01:22,862 --> 02:01:25,592
-Did you bring Big Willie?
-And the twins.

1936
02:01:39,245 --> 02:01:40,507
Slow down, girl.

1937
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,946
l'll get my gun off
before l get my gun off, okay?

1938
02:01:43,015 --> 02:01:44,277
Pow, pow.

1939
02:02:26,259 --> 02:02:27,954
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

1940
02:02:28,694 --> 02:02:30,321
FRAZlER: Why don't you
just walk out the door?

1941
02:02:30,396 --> 02:02:31,488
DALTON: I will.

1942
02:02:31,764 --> 02:02:34,631
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1943
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:35,997
Son of a bitch.

1944
02:02:43,376 --> 02:02:46,277
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.
