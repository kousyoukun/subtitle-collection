1
00:00:43,21 --> 00:00:45,50
我的名字是道顿・罗素
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:46,34 --> 00:00:48,25
请仔细听我说的话
Pay strict attention to what I say

3
00:00:48,34 --> 00:00:52,17
因为我要说的话很重要，而且不会重覆一次
because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself.

4
00:00:52,38 --> 00:00:55,26
我说出了名字，那是我的身份
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

5
00:00:56,72 --> 00:01:00,35
我在的地方可以形容为囚房
The "where" could most readily be described as a prison cell.

6
00:01:00,89 --> 00:01:02,35
但是被困在一个小囚房
But there's a vast difference

7
00:01:02,39 --> 00:01:06,11
和坐牢有很大的不同
between being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison.

8
00:01:07,52 --> 00:01:09,73
我做了什么事很容易解释
The "what" is easy.

9
00:01:09,90 --> 00:01:14,74
最近我策划并执行一起完美的银行抢劫案
Recently I planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:15,45 --> 00:01:17,41
我也说出了时间
That's also the "when."

11
00:01:17,99 --> 00:01:22,20
至于为什么，除了很明显的财务动机
As for the "why," beyond the obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:22,75 --> 00:01:24,75
原因其实非常简单
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:25,75 --> 00:01:27,67
因为我办得到
Because I can.

14
00:01:28,46 --> 00:01:31,00
现在只剩下我是怎么办到的
Which leaves us only with the "how."

15
00:01:31,42 --> 00:01:34,30
就像大文豪莎士比亚说的
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:35,59 --> 00:01:37,59
这就耐人寻味了
lies the rub.

有位小姐在帮你做学校作业
a certain young lady who's helping you with the Triborough Bridge project?

24
00:05:02,59 --> 00:05:04,55
-好吗？ -好的
-Okay? -All right, okay.

25

-哪里？51街吗？ -对，他现在还住在那里
-Now? On 51st? 50... -Yeah, that's where he is right now.

27
00:05:13,69 --> 00:05:17,73
不，他还在47街，不过地方比较小
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street, but it's a much smaller space.

28
00:05:17,82 --> 00:05:19,61
我要怎样…
What do I have to...

29
00:05:21,32 --> 00:05:24,82
咱们去吃龙虾，刷安先生的卡
Yeah, we'll get lobster. I'll put it on Mr. Ansinori's card.

30
00:05:24,91 --> 00:05:28,91
无所谓，反正他要去见客户
Whatever. It's a meeting with one of his clients or something.

31
00:05:30,62 --> 00:05:33,75
这一年来都是这样
Because it's been like over a year now. Yeah.

32
00:05:36,71 --> 00:05:39,04
我好想掐断这家伙的脖子
I want to snap this guy's neck, I swear to God.

只是花嘛，也许是送他阿嬷的
So what? They're flowers. They could've been to his grandmother.

35

也许是送我的，今天我生日
They could've been to me. It's my birthday, so...

36
00:05:53,68 --> 00:05:55,89
好啦，搞不好是送客户啦
Okay, so maybe it's a client's .

37
00:05:58,44 --> 00:06:00,48
这有够好笑
Okay. This is funny.

38
00:06:00,86 --> 00:06:04,61
这家伙以为我没看到他在瞄我
I got this guy in front of me that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

00:06:04,70 --> 00:06:07,91

Fantastic. God damn it.

-Excuse me. -Yeah.

请你小声一点
Can you lower your voice just a little bit, please?

好啦

-你不如把他赶走 -对哦，不行啦
-Can't you get rid of him? -I could, couldn't I?

108
00:09:51,38 --> 00:09:53,84
她很疼他，赶也赶不走
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do? Put him out in the street?

109
00:09:53,92 --> 00:09:55,51
-他喜欢你吗？ -爱得要命
-How's he feel about you? -Oh, he's thrilled.

110

You know, "If we had a bigger place, we wouldn't have this problem."

113
00:10:02,39 --> 00:10:04,94
如果我们结婚，就另当别论
Of course, if we got married then things would be different.

114
00:10:05,02 --> 00:10:07,98
-结婚有什么不好？ -筹备婚礼、布置房子、生小孩

-Come on, man. You've been married. -Please. I was 21.

你只要记得一件事
Here's all you need to know. You walk in unarmed.

132

手无寸铁走进去面对抢匪首领
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head and makes you get on your knees.

You look around. There are five armed men pointing Uzis at you.

134
00:10:54,90 --> 00:10:56,49
然后想像他们穿内衣裤的样子
Just picture them in their underwear.

135
00:10:56,57 --> 00:10:58,16
或是想像他们穿囚衣戴手铐
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

136
00:10:58,24 --> 00:11:01,74
-这就对了，你行的 -大坏蛋，我来也
-There you go, Keith. You can do this, man. -Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

137
00:11:26,35 --> 00:11:28,44
退到转角！退后！
Get back around the corner! Get back!

138
00:11:28,52 --> 00:11:31,02
我叫你们退后！
I told you, move it! Move it!

139
00:11:31,98 --> 00:11:34,73
把这些闲杂人等赶走！
Get those people back! Get them the hell out of here!

140
00:11:36,40 --> 00:11:39,49
一到了就下车，上吧
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up, I want everybody out.

141
00:11:42,07 --> 00:11:44,03
二楼窗口
The second floor window. Now.

142
00:11:44,54 --> 00:11:47,33
-让他们进去！ -上吧！
-Let them in there! -Let's go! Go now!

143
00:11:49,21 --> 00:11:50,58
什么状况？
Sarge, what do you got?

144
00:11:50,67 --> 00:11:53,38
抢匪在银行，可能有人质
I got a perp in the bank. Possible hostage situation.

145
00:11:53,46 --> 00:11:54,71
今天谁指挥？
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

146
00:11:54,80 --> 00:11:56,96
-何警官 -把他找来
-Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here. -Get him down here.

147
00:11:57,05 --> 00:11:59,47
-何警官？ -说吧
-Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air? -On the air. Go.

148
00:11:59,55 --> 00:12:02,30
柯巡警报的案
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here. He called this in.

149
00:12:02,39 --> 00:12:03,85
请你过来
Can you come over to the other side?

150
00:12:03,89 --> 00:12:06,14
马上来，上吧
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

151
00:12:18,03 --> 00:12:20,45
支援！走边边
Back up! Go around, around the corner.

152
00:12:20,53 --> 00:12:22,82
-撤退 -确保这里安全
-Pull back. Pull it back. -We got to keep this secure.

153
00:12:22,91 --> 00:12:25,03
-柯巡警，什么状况？ -何警官
-Collins? What you got? -Hernandez.

154
00:12:25,12 --> 00:12:28,79
抢匪持枪，他说有人质
I got a perp inside with a gun. He claims he's got some hostages in there.

155
00:12:30,41 --> 00:12:32,88
让出一条路
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

156
00:12:38,96 --> 00:12:40,67
纽约警局指挥站

157
00:12:52,81 --> 00:12:55,19
上吧，拉起拒马
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

158
00:12:55,81 --> 00:12:57,86
一切都在控制之下
We've got it under control.

159
00:12:58,57 --> 00:13:00,03
请退后
Step back, please!

160
00:13:00,11 --> 00:13:02,40
-退后 -回来，谢谢
-Step back! -Get back! Thank you.

161
00:13:02,45 --> 00:13:04,41
这里没什么好看的
There's nothing going on.

162
00:13:04,62 --> 00:13:06,45
你们今晚就会看到新闻了
You'll see it on the news tonight.

163
00:13:06,53 --> 00:13:08,20
请退后
Step back, please.

164
00:13:20,17 --> 00:13:21,42
寇先生？
Mr. Case?

165
00:13:21,51 --> 00:13:24,18
早安，凯萨琳，有什么事？
Oh, good morning, Katherine. What can I do for you?

166
00:13:24,26 --> 00:13:27,47
有一间分行发生抢案
Sir, there's a robbery in progress at one of our branches.

167
00:13:27,55 --> 00:13:29,10
天啊
Oh, my.

168
00:13:29,22 --> 00:13:33,23
-有人受伤吗？ -没有，不过有人质
-Has anybody been hurt? -I don't think so, but there are hostages.

169
00:13:34,14 --> 00:13:35,77
真糟糕
Oh, how awful.

170
00:13:36,98 --> 00:13:40,48
-哪一间分行？ -32分行，交易街20号
-Which branch is it? -Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

171
00:13:41,15 --> 00:13:43,61
-哪一间？ -交易街20号
-Which one? -20 Exchange Place.

172
00:13:46,41 --> 00:13:47,99
谢谢你，凯萨琳
Thank you, Katherine.

173
00:13:48,08 --> 00:13:49,83
很遗憾
I'm sorry, Mr. Case.

174
00:14:01,71 --> 00:14:03,26
天啊
Oh, dear God.

175
00:14:05,68 --> 00:14:08,30
把路人赶走，拉开拒马
Get these people out of here. Come on, open these gates. Back up.

176
00:14:08,39 --> 00:14:10,68
进来吧
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

177
00:14:16,02 --> 00:14:18,81
我是柯巡警，你是谈判专家？
Sergeant Collins, first on scene. Are you the hostage negotiator?

178
00:14:18,90 --> 00:14:21,61
对，费警探，这是米警探，什么状况？
That's right. Detective Frazier. This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

179
00:14:21,69 --> 00:14:23,61
银行烟雾弥漫
Not much. Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

180
00:14:23,69 --> 00:14:25,99
大门锁住，我探头进去
The door was locked. I tried to take a look inside

181
00:14:26,07 --> 00:14:29,49
抢匪打开大门，拿点357手枪指住我
and one of the gunmen opens the door, sticks a .357 in my face,

182
00:14:29,53 --> 00:14:32,12
用外国口音说要杀死人质
screaming in some foreign accent about killing hostages.

183
00:14:32,20 --> 00:14:34,96
-看到其他嫌犯吗？ -没，什么都看不到
-See any other gunmen? -No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

184
00:14:35,04 --> 00:14:36,67
-听到什么吗？ -也没
-You hear anything inside? -No, sir,

185
00:14:36,75 --> 00:14:40,75
他拿着枪指住我，我脑袋一片空白，对不起
but with that .357 sticking in my face, I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

186
00:14:41,21 --> 00:14:42,80
好吧
Okay.

187
00:14:43,80 --> 00:14:47,05
很好，你做得很好
Good, good. Good, good, good, good. You did a good job, Sergeant.

188
00:14:47,13 --> 00:14:49,43
有人拿枪指过你吗？
You ever had a gun stuck in your face before?

189
00:14:49,51 --> 00:14:50,64
-有一次 -真的？
-Yeah, once. -Really?

190
00:14:50,72 --> 00:14:52,47
12岁的小子
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

191
00:14:52,51 --> 00:14:55,98
-那次感觉怎样？ -不是很好的经验
-What was that like? -Not one of my better days.

192
00:14:56,06 --> 00:14:58,15
那是一定的
I bet. All right, well, look.

193
00:14:58,23 --> 00:15:00,90
把事情搞清楚你就能回家
As soon as we get this thing cleared up, we'll cut you loose, all right?

194
00:15:00,98 --> 00:15:02,90
你不介意的话，我想留下来
If you don't mind, I'd rather hang around a while,

195
00:15:02,98 --> 00:15:04,74
至少等到跟嫌犯有接触后
at least until we make contact.

196
00:15:04,82 --> 00:15:07,07
这样最好
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

197
00:15:25,30 --> 00:15:28,59
拜托，你干嘛这么做？
What? Come on. Why you doing this? Why you doing this to me?

198
00:15:30,05 --> 00:15:32,68
爸，怎么回事？
Pop, what's going on? Yo.

199
00:15:36,64 --> 00:15:39,73
银行职员举手
All bank employees, raise your hands!

200
00:15:40,77 --> 00:15:44,86
银行职员到这边，其他人到那边
Bank employees, this side! Everyone else, over there!

201
00:15:51,16 --> 00:15:55,70
我要每个人把手机和钥匙
Now, I need everybody to take your cell phones and your keys

202
00:15:55,74 --> 00:15:59,42
从口袋和皮包里拿出来举高
out of your pockets and handbags and hold them in the air.

203
00:16:20,19 --> 00:16:22,06
-你叫什么？ -彼得
-What's your name? -Peter.

204
00:16:22,15 --> 00:16:24,65
-彼得什么？ -彼得韩蒙
-Peter what? -Peter Hammond.

205
00:16:24,73 --> 00:16:28,03
-你的手机呢？ -留在家里
-Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond? -I left it at home.

206
00:16:30,15 --> 00:16:33,95
我下一个问题你要好好回答
Peter, think very carefully about how you answer the next question

207
00:16:34,03 --> 00:16:37,29
答错了你的墓碑铭会写…
because if you get it wrong, your headstone will read,

208
00:16:37,79 --> 00:16:40,46
大英雄彼得韩蒙英年早逝
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

209
00:16:40,96 --> 00:16:43,88
他试图阻止一场银行抢案
"who valiantly attempted to prevent a brilliant bank robbery

210
00:16:43,96 --> 00:16:46,80
把手机藏起来
"by trying to hide his cellular phone,

211
00:16:46,88 --> 00:16:50,47
“结果被一枪轰掉脑袋”
"but wound up getting shot in the fucking head."

212
00:16:51,84 --> 00:16:54,68
彼得
Now, Peter Hammond,

213
00:16:55,76 --> 00:16:57,10
你的手机呢？
where is your cell phone?

214
00:16:57,18 --> 00:16:59,68
我说过，我留在家里
I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

215
00:17:32,97 --> 00:17:35,18
通讯簿，彼得・韩蒙

216
00:17:54,86 --> 00:17:57,32
我不该说谎，对不起
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

217
00:17:57,37 --> 00:17:59,37
没关系
Hey. Don't worry about it.

218
00:18:19,81 --> 00:18:22,98
拜托，听我说
Just let me talk to you! Please, please, listen to me.

219
00:18:23,06 --> 00:18:24,73
让我解释
Let me explain.

220
00:18:26,52 --> 00:18:28,23
救命啊！
Help! Help me.

221
00:18:28,73 --> 00:18:30,36
住手！
Stop!

222
00:18:30,69 --> 00:18:32,32
住手！
Stop!

223
00:18:50,13 --> 00:18:52,92
还有人自以为比我聪明吗？
Anyone else here smarter than me?

224
00:18:59,60 --> 00:19:02,22
-你叫什么？ -威克姆・瓦里
-And you are? -Vikram Walia.

225
00:19:02,31 --> 00:19:05,06
谢了，威克姆
Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

226
00:19:05,10 --> 00:19:06,69
先生
Hey, mister.

227
00:19:11,52 --> 00:19:12,78
留着吧
Keep it.

228
00:19:12,82 --> 00:19:15,44
男人，这边，女人，这边
Men here. Women here.

229
00:19:16,78 --> 00:19:18,32
快点
Move!

230
00:19:23,95 --> 00:19:27,12
全身脱光，只剩内衣裤
I need all of you to strip down to your underwear.

231
00:19:29,04 --> 00:19:30,58
快点
Now.

232
00:19:52,36 --> 00:19:53,90
女士
Lady?

233
00:19:54,36 --> 00:19:59,15
相信我，平常我不会想看你的脱衣秀
Believe me. This is the only situation where I'd ask you to do this.

234
00:20:00,36 --> 00:20:03,83
-快给我脱衣服 -不
-But take off your fucking clothes. -No.

235
00:20:04,66 --> 00:20:07,16
你真不要脸
You should be ashamed of yourself.

236
00:20:08,66 --> 00:20:10,62
你是有毛病吗？
What's with you mishegoyim?

237
00:20:10,71 --> 00:20:13,00
有种就动手呀
Go ahead. Make my day.

238
00:20:13,09 --> 00:20:15,63
-把衣服给我脱掉 -不要！
-Take your fucking clothes off, lady. -No!

239
00:20:17,42 --> 00:20:19,05
史蒂威
Stevie?

240
00:20:22,18 --> 00:20:23,76
走吧
Let's go!

241
00:20:25,14 --> 00:20:27,47
现在，我要你们全部
Now, I need all of you

242
00:20:27,52 --> 00:20:30,48
穿上这些衣服，戴上面罩
to put on one of these suits and these masks.

243
00:20:40,70 --> 00:20:43,70
这是CBS记者香恩，我正在曼哈顿信托银行外面
I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News, outside Manhattan Trust Bank,

244
00:20:43,78 --> 00:20:46,29
警方表示
where we have just been told by investigators,

245
00:20:46,37 --> 00:20:48,04
银行遭到抢劫
the bank has been robbed.

246
00:20:48,12 --> 00:20:51,37
嫌犯挟持人质
The suspect or possible suspects are inside,

247
00:20:51,42 --> 00:20:53,29
人数不明
holed up with an unknown number of hostages.

248
00:20:53,38 --> 00:20:55,00
-戴队长？ -对
-Captain Darius? -Yeah.

249
00:20:55,04 --> 00:20:57,05
我是费警探，这是米警探
I'm Detective Frazier. This is Detective Mitchell.

250
00:20:57,13 --> 00:20:58,17
嘿
Hey.

251
00:20:58,26 --> 00:21:00,63
我受训时和你处理过
You may remember, we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

252
00:21:00,72 --> 00:21:02,34
人质事件
during my training?

253
00:21:02,43 --> 00:21:04,89
对，那次很遗憾
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

254
00:21:04,93 --> 00:21:07,14
是的
Yeah, it was. It was.

255
00:21:07,22 --> 00:21:08,47
什么状况？
So, what do we got?

256
00:21:08,56 --> 00:21:12,23
抢匪和人质人数不明
I got an unknown number of suspects and an unknown number of hostages,

257
00:21:12,31 --> 00:21:15,86
却有一百万个围观民众，银行啥都看不见
and a bank, and about a million spectators, and I can't see shit inside there,

258
00:21:15,90 --> 00:21:17,65
-我很忙 -我了解
-so I'm kind of busy. -I understand.

259
00:21:17,73 --> 00:21:20,40
我只跟高先生合作
The way this works, Mr. Frazier, is I deal with Mr. Grossman.

260
00:21:20,49 --> 00:21:22,78
有事请去找他，好吗？
So if you need anything, you can speak with him, okay?

261
00:21:22,86 --> 00:21:24,87
不好，队长
No, it's not okay, Captain.

262
00:21:24,91 --> 00:21:27,45
高警探在休假
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

263
00:21:27,53 --> 00:21:30,41
今天费警探当家作主
so Detective Frazier is the big dick today, all right?

264
00:21:30,45 --> 00:21:34,08
你有事请来找我，行吗？
Now, if you need anything, you can speak to me, all right?

265
00:21:34,17 --> 00:21:35,54
只好这样吧
I guess it'll have to be.

266
00:21:35,63 --> 00:21:37,92
没错，防弹背心？
That's the way it's gonna be. You got vests for us?

267
00:21:37,96 --> 00:21:39,25
-小珀 -有
-Berk! -Yo!

268
00:21:39,34 --> 00:21:41,26
-给他们防弹背心 -好
-Get these guys some vests! -Okay.

269
00:21:41,34 --> 00:21:43,22
-帮他们登记 -好
-And check them into the command log. -Okay.

270
00:21:43,26 --> 00:21:44,97
我们先让你
You know what? I'm gonna get out of your hair

271
00:21:45,05 --> 00:21:46,93
掌握犯罪现场
and let you get control of this crime scene, okay?

272
00:21:47,01 --> 00:21:49,26
准备好了再通知我
You'll let me know when you're ready with a detailed briefing?

273
00:21:49,35 --> 00:21:52,27
-好 -我们要去小馆子
-Okay. -We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

274
00:21:52,56 --> 00:21:55,31
行动之前先通知我们
Don't go in the bank without calling us first, all right? Okay?

275
00:21:55,40 --> 00:21:57,98
-没问题 -很高兴见到你
-All right. -Good to see you, Captain.

276
00:22:06,37 --> 00:22:08,41
我们不留在那儿吗？
Shouldn't we be in there?

277
00:22:08,78 --> 00:22:11,66
给他点时间，看他怎么做
Let's give him some time. See what he does. Come on.

278
00:22:12,79 --> 00:22:15,25
他没布署好前
Until he secures his position and gets the physical layout,

279
00:22:15,33 --> 00:22:16,58
只会向我们发飙
he'll only dump on us.

280
00:22:16,63 --> 00:22:19,04
行动之前他一定会通知我，相信我，我知道他会
If the show starts, he'll call us. Trust me. I've seen him work.

281
00:22:19,13 --> 00:22:20,25
你做主
Your call, Keith.

282
00:22:20,30 --> 00:22:22,63
麻烦你
Can you get that for me? I guess it is, isn't it?

283
00:22:22,67 --> 00:22:24,51
我一定要强势一点
That's the one thing I learned from Grossman,

284
00:22:24,59 --> 00:22:26,84
因为这些人不信谈判这一套
is these guys don't have much respect for what we do.

285
00:22:26,93 --> 00:22:29,30
-怎么说？ -他们只会硬着来蛮干
-How do you mean? -Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

286
00:22:29,39 --> 00:22:33,52
完全不懂谈判心理战术
Us being here means there's a mental side to it that they don't get.

287
00:22:33,60 --> 00:22:35,89
-我就说你一定行 -对
-Told you, you could handle this. -Yeah.

288
00:22:35,98 --> 00:22:39,36
我一直在等上级命令我
I keep waiting for someone higher up on the food chain to show up and say,

289
00:22:39,44 --> 00:22:40,57
“怎么做”
"Here's what we do."

290
00:22:40,65 --> 00:22:42,11
上次人质事件怎么回事？
What happened at the hospital?

291
00:22:42,15 --> 00:22:44,90
嫌犯杀死女友后自杀
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend. Thank you.

292
00:22:54,75 --> 00:22:56,71
我说过，我有…
I told you, I've got

293
00:22:58,88 --> 00:23:01,30
心脏病
a heart condition.

294
00:23:01,50 --> 00:23:03,05
起来
Get up.

295
00:23:28,61 --> 00:23:30,16
把枪放下
Put down your fucking weapons!

296
00:23:30,20 --> 00:23:32,53
-别动 -别开枪
-Don't move! Don't move! -Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

297
00:23:32,58 --> 00:23:34,75
-别动，过来！ -我还没…
-Don't move! Don't move! Come here! -I haven't got...

298
00:23:34,83 --> 00:23:38,29
-过来！ -我在银行上班
-Come here, come here, come here! -I work in the bank!

299
00:23:38,37 --> 00:23:40,21
跪下来！
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

300
00:23:40,29 --> 00:23:41,84
-他们派我出来 -现在
-They sent me out here! -Now!

301
00:23:41,88 --> 00:23:43,71
-他们派我出来 -现在
-They sent me out here! -Now!

302
00:23:43,80 --> 00:23:45,51
-他叫你们离远一点 -戴上手铐
-He said stay away! -Cuff him.

303
00:23:45,55 --> 00:23:48,05
不然就会丢出两具尸体
If you come near the bank, he'll throw out two dead bodies!

304
00:23:48,09 --> 00:23:50,05
-谁说的？ -我不认识！
-Who said this? Who? -I don't know who!

305
00:23:50,14 --> 00:23:51,55
拿着好大一把枪的…
The guy with the big fucking gun!

306
00:23:51,64 --> 00:23:53,35
-家伙说的 -好，起来，走吧
-That's who! -All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

307
00:23:53,39 --> 00:23:54,89
-一共有四个人 -来吧
-There's four of them in there! -Come on.

308
00:23:54,97 --> 00:23:56,14
天啊
Christ!

309
00:23:56,23 --> 00:23:57,48
-冷静点 -走吧
-Calm down! -Let's go!

310
00:23:57,56 --> 00:24:00,77
-我会上电视吗？ -会啦，大明星，走吧
-Am I gonna be on TV? -Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

311
00:24:03,86 --> 00:24:07,28
我有没有想过不能再见到家人？
Was it a time when I thought I might not see my family again? Yeah.

312
00:24:07,36 --> 00:24:10,03
当然有想过
Yeah, I thought about it. I mean, at first, I wasn't ...

313
00:24:10,07 --> 00:24:12,53
一开始我被枪指住完全呆掉
It was too much to think about at that point.

314
00:24:12,57 --> 00:24:15,62
过了一会儿…
You know, with a gun in your face, but after a while I...

315
00:24:15,70 --> 00:24:17,87
我才想到…
You know, I thought about...

316
00:24:19,87 --> 00:24:21,04
嗯…
Yeah.

317
00:24:21,08 --> 00:24:23,96
也许不能再见到我老婆小孩
My wife, you know, not seeing my wife again.

318
00:24:24,04 --> 00:24:28,42
我有一个10岁大的儿子，一个17岁大的女儿
My kids. I got a 10-year-old son, 17-year-old daughter.

319
00:24:30,01 --> 00:24:33,18
我当然会想到他们
Yeah, I thought about it, man. What do you think?

320
00:24:33,93 --> 00:24:35,93
他们是我的心肝宝贝
Those are my babies.

321
00:25:30,86 --> 00:25:32,20
太完美了
Beautiful.

322
00:25:49,09 --> 00:25:50,63
开始吧
Go ahead.

323
00:25:50,67 --> 00:25:52,76
魏小姐，请你放心
Miss White, I want you to rest assured

324
00:25:52,84 --> 00:25:55,68
我只想住在这个美好城市
my only intention is to spend time in your wonderful city

325
00:25:55,72 --> 00:25:57,51
好好地享受生活
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

326
00:25:57,60 --> 00:25:59,01
你没跟你叔叔做生意？
And no business with your uncle?

327
00:25:59,06 --> 00:26:01,35
我跟他没什么关系
In truth, I have very little to do with him these days.

328
00:26:01,43 --> 00:26:03,94
你也有九年没见过他了？
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years. Is that right?

329
00:26:04,02 --> 00:26:07,52
-你的消息很灵通 -这是一定要的，是的？
-You are extremely well informed. -I have to be. Yes?

330
00:26:07,61 --> 00:26:10,61
寇亚瑟先生来电
I have a Mr. Arthur Case on the phone for you.

331
00:26:12,36 --> 00:26:13,57
今天就到此结束
We'll need to end this here.

332
00:26:13,65 --> 00:26:15,66
我需要购买协议书
I'm gonna need a copy of your purchase agreement,

333
00:26:15,74 --> 00:26:17,83
和房贷申请表
your mortgage application, and the other documentation,

334
00:26:17,91 --> 00:26:20,12
-保持联络 -谢谢你，魏小姐
-and I'll be in touch. -Thank you, Miss White.

335
00:26:20,20 --> 00:26:21,95
这里请
Right this way, sir.

336
00:26:32,97 --> 00:26:34,84
寇亚瑟？你确定？
Arthur Case? You sure?

337
00:26:34,88 --> 00:26:36,97
-他是这么说 -是他本人说的
-That's what he said. -He said his name, just like that?

338
00:26:37,05 --> 00:26:39,39
不是秘书？
It wasn't his secretary saying he was on the line?

339
00:26:39,43 --> 00:26:41,39
-没错 -接过来
-No, ma'am. -All right. Put him through.

340
00:26:41,47 --> 00:26:42,98
好
Okay.

341
00:26:46,02 --> 00:26:48,90
-我是麦德琳・魏特 -我是寇亚瑟
-This is Madeleine White. -Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.

342
00:26:48,94 --> 00:26:50,40
早安
Oh, good morning, Mr. Case.

343
00:26:50,48 --> 00:26:54,40
-我们正式见过面吗？ -应该没有吧
-Have we met formally? -No, sir, I don't believe we have.

344
00:26:55,07 --> 00:26:57,70
我在南汉普敦的派对
Yet, you're always turning up

345
00:26:57,78 --> 00:27:00,16
你都有去
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

346
00:27:01,87 --> 00:27:04,87
是的，我们有相同的朋友
Yes, we know some of the same people.

347
00:27:04,96 --> 00:27:06,25
我猜是吧
It seems.

348
00:27:06,33 --> 00:27:08,58
我就直话直说了
I'll come right to the point.

349
00:27:09,25 --> 00:27:11,96
我有一件麻烦事
I have a small problem which requires someone

350
00:27:12,05 --> 00:27:15,34
需要能力强，能保密的人处理
with very special skills and complete discretion.

351
00:27:16,09 --> 00:27:19,22
你是这个人吗？还是误传的？
Are you such a person or have I been misinformed?

352
00:27:19,93 --> 00:27:21,64
请继续说
Go on.

353
00:27:21,89 --> 00:27:24,85
我五分钟后去接你
Can I pick you up in front of your office building in five minutes?

354
00:27:24,93 --> 00:27:27,23
-我会在楼下等你 -谢谢
-I'll be downstairs. -Thank you.

355
00:27:32,82 --> 00:27:36,28
他们计划周详、大费周章
They had a kind of genius plan

356
00:27:36,32 --> 00:27:38,86
把我们耍得团团转
for throwing us out of whack

357
00:27:38,95 --> 00:27:43,33
让我们完全搞不清状况
and depriving us of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

358
00:27:43,41 --> 00:27:45,50
他们的态度非常…
They were... They were very

359
00:27:48,00 --> 00:27:51,09
强硬，不过感觉却很疏离
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

360
00:27:51,13 --> 00:27:55,05
他们互相称呼史蒂夫小名
All I know is that they called each other a variation of Steve.

361
00:27:55,59 --> 00:27:58,22
史蒂芬、史蒂佛、史蒂威
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

362
00:27:58,30 --> 00:27:59,51
他们怎么称呼你？
And they called you what?

363
00:27:59,59 --> 00:28:01,60
没有，他们只…
They didn't call me anything. They just told me...

364
00:28:01,64 --> 00:28:04,77
你在说谎，老实说
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now. You're lying to me.

365
00:28:04,81 --> 00:28:06,68
看着我说实话
Tell me the... Look at me and tell me the truth.

366
00:28:06,77 --> 00:28:09,39
他们四个都有AK-47冲锋枪耶
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

367
00:28:09,48 --> 00:28:11,23
-你是枪械专家吗？ -不是
-You know a lot about guns. -No.

368
00:28:11,31 --> 00:28:14,27
-我对枪一点都不懂 -你就认得AK-47冲锋枪
-I don't know anything about guns, except... -But you know they had an AK-47.

369
00:28:14,32 --> 00:28:17,40
-每个人都认得吧 -每个人？
-Everybody knows what an AK-47 is. -Everybody?

370
00:28:17,49 --> 00:28:21,41
每个看过动作片的人都认得
Anybody who's ever watched a decent action movie would.

371
00:28:21,49 --> 00:28:24,12
-你抢过银行吗？ -开什么玩笑？
-You ever rob a bank before? -Are you kidding?

372
00:28:24,16 --> 00:28:26,87
我才没有咧
Me rob a bank? No.

373
00:28:27,08 --> 00:28:29,12
-你没偷过钱吗？ -没有
-Never stole a dollar? -Never.

374
00:28:29,16 --> 00:28:31,50
-从来没有？ -一次也没有
-Never? -Not ever.

375
00:28:31,54 --> 00:28:34,63
-其实咧 -一定有过一次
-You know what? -That one time. That one time, that one time.

376
00:28:34,71 --> 00:28:38,17
我从我外婆的皮包偷过五角
I stole a nickel from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

377
00:28:39,84 --> 00:28:41,64
她是波兰人
She was Polish.

378
00:28:42,01 --> 00:28:46,31
我都跟她说…
I used to go up to her and say, "Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah."

379
00:28:47,93 --> 00:28:52,44
有一天我打开她皮包看到五角
One day, I opened her pocketbook and there was a nickel.

380
00:28:52,52 --> 00:28:54,11
于是就拿走
I took it.

381
00:28:54,19 --> 00:28:56,36
我只拿走五角硬币
That was the only thing I ever took.

382
00:29:00,20 --> 00:29:03,03
我刚才不是故意找你碴
Look, Detective, I didn't mean to give you a hard time back there.

383
00:29:03,12 --> 00:29:05,33
算了，情况如何？
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

384
00:29:05,37 --> 00:29:09,16
被放的人质是古赫蒙，73岁
Well, the hostage they let go was Herman Gluck, 73.

385
00:29:09,20 --> 00:29:11,62
他的胸口疼痛，医务人员正在帮他检查
He was having chest pains. Paramedics have him.

386
00:29:11,71 --> 00:29:15,21
他说警方如果敢靠近大门
They told him to say that if any cops came near the door,

387
00:29:15,29 --> 00:29:17,63
他们就会丢出两具尸体
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

388
00:29:17,71 --> 00:29:21,59
他认为有四名抢匪扮成油漆工走进银行
He thinks there's four perps. Says they came in dressed as painters.

389
00:29:22,55 --> 00:29:25,01
银行有监视系统
There's a video system in the bank.

390
00:29:25,39 --> 00:29:27,01
我们正在下载
We're working on getting a download

391
00:29:27,06 --> 00:29:30,48
监视器画面，不过要花点时间
from Manhattan Trust's central security office, but it'll take a while.

392
00:29:30,56 --> 00:29:33,90
整条街封锁，狙击手守在窗口
We got the block locked up. I got men in the windows.

393
00:29:33,98 --> 00:29:36,69
我们也在检查下水道出口
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

394
00:29:36,77 --> 00:29:38,11
电话呢？
What about the phones?

395
00:29:38,19 --> 00:29:42,07
全都转到这里来，他们只能打给我们
Cut and diverted into M.C.C. We're the only ones they're gonna call.

396
00:29:42,36 --> 00:29:46,87
手机已受到监控，随时可以拦截通话讯号
Cell phones are monitored and we can jam the air whenever you say.

397
00:29:46,95 --> 00:29:50,20
也许人质会打手机求救
But we like to leave it clear in case a hostage is able to get through,

398
00:29:50,25 --> 00:29:52,41
目前没有任何消息
but so far nothing.

399
00:29:52,92 --> 00:29:55,46
-119报案中心呢？ -在荧幕上
-911? -It's up on the screen.

400
00:29:55,54 --> 00:29:58,55
所有相关报案电话都会转过来
Any call about a bank gets routed straight to us.

401
00:29:58,80 --> 00:30:02,42
这就是目前的状况
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

402
00:30:03,59 --> 00:30:05,09
好
Yeah.

403
00:30:05,84 --> 00:30:07,72
我还不要打给他们
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

404
00:30:07,76 --> 00:30:09,39
什么？
Beg your pardon?

405
00:30:10,10 --> 00:30:11,73
时机还不对
Doesn't feel right yet, you know what I mean?

406
00:30:11,81 --> 00:30:13,73
我不想先问他需要什么
I'm not gonna call him and ask what I can do for him.

407
00:30:13,77 --> 00:30:15,94
我要看他下一步做什么
Let's see what he does.

408
00:30:16,73 --> 00:30:18,36
你做主
Your call.

409
00:30:26,12 --> 00:30:28,74
让我解释我的做事方式
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you let me explain to you how I work?

410
00:30:28,83 --> 00:30:30,79
请说吧
Please. That would be nice.

411
00:30:31,16 --> 00:30:35,87
你说你的保险箱有传家之宝
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms inside your safety deposit box.

412
00:30:35,96 --> 00:30:37,33
没问题
That's fine.

413
00:30:37,42 --> 00:30:41,09
不过以我的经验，你这种人通常有人
But in my experience, people like you have people working for them

414
00:30:41,17 --> 00:30:42,63
处理这种事
that handle these kinds of things.

415
00:30:42,71 --> 00:30:45,68
不会亲自打电话给我
And when they can't , well, they don't call me.

416
00:30:45,76 --> 00:30:47,72
而是请亲信打给我
Their people call me.

417
00:30:47,80 --> 00:30:50,81
所以你在保险箱放的东西
So, immediately, I know that there's something in that box

418
00:30:50,89 --> 00:30:54,18
就连亲信都不想让他们知道
that you don't even want your closest aides to know about.

419
00:30:55,02 --> 00:30:56,65
这也没问题
No problem with me.

420
00:30:56,73 --> 00:31:00,90
我不必知道保险箱里有什么
You tell me I don't need to know what's in that box and I don't need to know.

421
00:31:00,98 --> 00:31:03,86
不过如果你说是棒球卡
But if you tell me that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

422
00:31:03,94 --> 00:31:07,91
我却发现是核弹发射密码
and I find out that it's the launch codes for a nuclear missile,

423
00:31:08,45 --> 00:31:11,70
那我们的协议就失效
then let's just say we no longer have an agreement.

424
00:31:11,79 --> 00:31:13,91
-你说完了吗？ -说完了
-Have you finished? -Yes.

425
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:16,08
保险箱里的东西
What's inside that box, young lady,

426
00:31:16,17 --> 00:31:18,88
比你还要老
has belonged to me since before you were born.

427
00:31:19,00 --> 00:31:23,13
而且非常珍贵，对任何人不会造成危险
It's very valuable and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

428
00:31:23,67 --> 00:31:25,47
除了你以外
Except you.

429
00:31:26,88 --> 00:31:29,68
首先，银行有持枪抢匪
Okay. Well, first, there are men with guns in there,

430
00:31:29,76 --> 00:31:31,60
我没办法保证能进去，同意吗？
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

431
00:31:31,68 --> 00:31:33,39
-当然了 -好
-Of course. -All right.

432
00:31:33,47 --> 00:31:36,39
你确定他们想抢你的保险箱？
Now, what makes you think that they want to rob your box?

433
00:31:36,48 --> 00:31:38,15
我不确定
I don't .

434
00:31:38,85 --> 00:31:42,48
你希望达到什么目的？
Well, why don't you tell me how you would like this to end?

435
00:31:44,19 --> 00:31:49,11
我不要任何人动我的保险箱
I'd prefer that nobody ever touch my safe deposit box.

436
00:31:49,36 --> 00:31:52,20
你、抢匪或警方都不能动
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

437
00:31:52,24 --> 00:31:55,12
这件事愈早收场我愈高兴
And the sooner this situation ends, the happier I'll be.

438
00:31:55,20 --> 00:31:57,87
-我说的够清楚吧？ -不够
-Is that specific enough for you? -No.

439
00:32:00,50 --> 00:32:02,46
保险箱里的东西
The contents of that box

440
00:32:04,71 --> 00:32:06,72
对我很重要
are of great value to me.

441
00:32:08,05 --> 00:32:10,18
那是我的秘密
So long as they remain my secret.

442
00:32:10,22 --> 00:32:12,26
如果这些秘密曝光？
And if they're exposed?

443
00:32:21,06 --> 00:32:23,07
我就会面对很多麻烦
I'll face some difficult questions.

444
00:32:23,23 --> 00:32:26,53
-最好锁起来或消失不见 -没错
-So, it stays locked or it disappears. -Precisely.

445
00:32:26,57 --> 00:32:28,90
-你办得到吗？ -办得到
-Can you make that happen? -Yes.

446
00:32:28,95 --> 00:32:32,32
希望如此，老实说，我对你没信心
I hope so. I have to say, I can't help but be skeptical.

447
00:32:32,41 --> 00:32:35,33
我也帮过向你推荐我的人士
Whoever gave you my number got the same deal.

448
00:32:35,49 --> 00:32:38,21
很显然他们对我很满意
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

449
00:32:46,09 --> 00:32:47,55
史蒂夫？
Steve?

450
00:32:47,59 --> 00:32:49,47
这次是史帝佛
It's time for Steve-O.

451
00:32:56,27 --> 00:32:59,31
我出去勘察现场
I came out here to take a look at the perimeter they laid down.

452
00:32:59,39 --> 00:33:00,77
你猜我发现什么？
Guess what I found?

453
00:33:00,81 --> 00:33:04,27
人质说抢匪扮成油漆工
That hostage they let out said these guys came in dressed like painters, right?

454
00:33:04,31 --> 00:33:05,82
对
Yeah.

455
00:33:15,74 --> 00:33:17,29
很可能是赃车
Probably stolen.

456
00:33:17,37 --> 00:33:19,83
请鉴识人员查指纹
Have them run it and check it for prints.

457
00:33:24,33 --> 00:33:27,30
-准备好了吗？ -好了
-Everybody on? -Yep, I'm there.

458
00:33:38,56 --> 00:33:41,48
-电话号码对吗？ -没错
-Sure you got the right number? -Absolutely.

459
00:33:51,82 --> 00:33:53,53
没人接
Okay. Nothing yet.

460
00:33:56,28 --> 00:33:57,49
调到监视画面了
We got video.

461
00:33:57,58 --> 00:33:59,20
放出来
Let's have it.

462
00:34:01,79 --> 00:34:03,75
摄影机怎么了？
What happened to that camera right there?

463
00:34:03,83 --> 00:34:06,17
等等
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

464
00:34:10,09 --> 00:34:11,63
对，这里，那家伙
Yeah, there it is. That guy right there.

465
00:34:11,72 --> 00:34:15,05
用手电筒破坏摄影机
It's like he blinds the camera with the flashlight.

466
00:34:15,14 --> 00:34:17,64
好奇怪耶，别人都没看见
It's weird, isn't it? It's like nobody else sees it.

467
00:34:17,72 --> 00:34:20,56
-闪光应该很亮才对 -可能是红外线
-You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh? -It could be infrared.

468
00:34:20,64 --> 00:34:22,77
-什么？ -红外线灯泡
-What's that? -Infrared bulb.

469
00:34:23,23 --> 00:34:25,81
肉眼看不见，摄影机能接收
See, humans can't see it, but a video camera will pick it up.

470
00:34:25,90 --> 00:34:27,94
他能神不知鬼不觉破坏摄影机
He could knock out the cameras without no one knowing.

471
00:34:28,02 --> 00:34:29,23
对
Right, right, right, right.

472
00:34:29,32 --> 00:34:31,11
那是早上十点的事
He knocked out the cameras about 10:00.

473
00:34:31,19 --> 00:34:33,32
整整有两分钟
So, for approximately two minutes,

474
00:34:33,36 --> 00:34:37,12
不知道有谁进出银行
we got no evidence of people leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

475
00:34:37,20 --> 00:34:40,20
玛莉莲，事发前你在银行多久？
Miriam, how long were you there before it began?

476
00:34:40,29 --> 00:34:41,83
几分钟而已
It was just a few minutes.

477
00:34:41,87 --> 00:34:45,04
爆炸和冒烟之后发生什么事？
Well, can you tell us what happened after the explosions and the smoke?

478
00:34:45,12 --> 00:34:49,46
他们叫我们趴下来，闭上眼睛
They just told us to put our heads down. And then close our eyes.

479
00:34:49,55 --> 00:34:52,51
其中一个
And then I just remember one of them

480
00:34:52,59 --> 00:34:55,38
叫其他人搞定摄影机
telling the others to just go down and fix the cameras.

481
00:34:55,43 --> 00:34:57,34
-监视摄影机？ -我不知道
-The video cameras? -I don't know.

482
00:34:57,39 --> 00:34:59,43
还有什么吗？
Anything else you want to share with us?

483
00:34:59,51 --> 00:35:00,56
没了
No, just...

484
00:35:00,64 --> 00:35:02,52
-你确定？ -确定
-You sure? -Yeah, I...

485
00:35:02,56 --> 00:35:05,60
请你招出抢匪的姓名
Could you give us the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

486
00:35:05,69 --> 00:35:07,69
我在耍你啦
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

487
00:35:07,73 --> 00:35:09,15
-没事吧？ -谢谢你
-You okay? -Thank you.

488
00:35:09,23 --> 00:35:10,36
好
Okay.

489
00:35:10,44 --> 00:35:12,40
-好可怕哦 -很恐怖吗？
-It was pretty awful. -Was it bad?

490
00:35:12,44 --> 00:35:14,61
他们逼我们脱衣服
I mean, they made us strip.

491
00:35:15,24 --> 00:35:17,70
逼我们把衣服全脱光
They made us take off our clothes.

492
00:35:19,37 --> 00:35:22,12
我不知道为什么
I don't understand why they had to do that.

493
00:35:22,20 --> 00:35:23,70
我真的以为…
I really just thought...

494
00:35:23,79 --> 00:35:26,12
我死定了
I thought I was gonna be killed.

495
00:35:26,92 --> 00:35:28,46
好了
Well.

496
00:35:30,09 --> 00:35:32,13
-没事了 -好
-All right, my dear. -Okay.

497
00:35:32,92 --> 00:35:34,67
-我能走了吗？ -不能
-I can go? -No.

498
00:35:34,76 --> 00:35:36,43
-不能？ -你得留下来
-No? -No, you got to stay.

499
00:35:36,51 --> 00:35:38,01
-你得留下来 -你可以走了
-You got to stay. -No, you can go.

500
00:35:38,09 --> 00:35:40,26
不行
No, stay. No, go.

501
00:35:40,35 --> 00:35:41,85
银行是你抢的吗？
Did you rob the bank?

502
00:35:41,93 --> 00:35:43,27
-就是你 -是不是你？
-You did. -Did you rob the bank?

503
00:35:43,31 --> 00:35:44,77
-不是 -你确定？
-No. -You sure?

504
00:35:45,27 --> 00:35:47,56
-大门有动静 -上吧
-There's movement at the front door. -Let's go.

505
00:35:51,02 --> 00:35:54,03
-把枪放下！ -别开枪
-Put down the fucking weapon! -Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

506
00:35:54,11 --> 00:35:55,94
别动！别动！
Don't move! Don't move!

507
00:35:56,03 --> 00:35:57,36
他身上有引爆装置
He's got a device on him there.

508
00:35:57,45 --> 00:36:00,66
手放在头后面，跪下来
I said put your hands on your head and get down on your fucking knees!

509
00:36:00,74 --> 00:36:03,33
我叫你手放在头后面，跪下来
I said put your hands on your head and down on your knees now!

510
00:36:03,41 --> 00:36:05,16
-他的手被绑住了 -他的手被绑住了
-Hands are tied! -Hands are tied.

511
00:36:05,25 --> 00:36:07,25
-搜他的身 -好
-Jesus, pat him down. -All right.

512
00:36:07,29 --> 00:36:09,21
-我是人质 -小心
-I'm one of the hostages! -Careful.

513
00:36:09,29 --> 00:36:12,13
-轻点，小心点 -我这里无法瞄准他
-Easy, be very careful, now. Easy. -I can't see him from where I'm at.

514
00:36:12,21 --> 00:36:15,01
-我这里可以 -有武器吗？
-I can see him. I got a clear shot. -Any weapons?

515
00:36:15,34 --> 00:36:17,63
-你是谁？ -威克姆・瓦里，银行职员
-Who are you? -Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

516
00:36:17,67 --> 00:36:19,84
这是炸弹吗？
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

517
00:36:19,93 --> 00:36:22,01
-靠，臭阿拉伯佬 -我是锡克教徒
-Oh, shit! A fucking Arab! -What? No. I'm a Sikh!

518
00:36:22,10 --> 00:36:23,31
-那是炸弹吗？ -不是
-Is that a bomb? -No.

519
00:36:23,39 --> 00:36:24,72
-说，这是炸弹吗？ -才不是
-Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb? -No.

520
00:36:24,81 --> 00:36:26,18
-这是陷阱吗？ -不是
-Are you booby-trapped? -No, fuck, no.

521
00:36:26,27 --> 00:36:27,77
威克姆，放轻松
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

522
00:36:27,81 --> 00:36:30,44
-帮我一下 -我不知道
-Jesus, give me a hand. -I don't know.

523
00:36:30,52 --> 00:36:32,61
银行有动静
Just watch. There's a lot of movement in that bank.

524
00:36:32,65 --> 00:36:34,15
-把他压住 -压住他
-Team, take him down. -Mike, now, get him.

525
00:36:34,19 --> 00:36:35,65
搞什么？轻点
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

526
00:36:35,69 --> 00:36:38,36
我的头巾，放开我
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

527
00:36:39,15 --> 00:36:41,99
把头巾还给我
Get... My turban! Look, fuck, give my turban back!

528
00:36:42,03 --> 00:36:43,41
闭嘴
Come on, shut up. Relax.

529
00:36:43,49 --> 00:36:45,33
你在干嘛？把头巾还给我
What the fuck are you doing? Give me my turban back.

530
00:36:45,41 --> 00:36:47,12
-你们不能扯掉我的头巾 -闭嘴
-You can't fucking rip my turban. -Shut up, already.

531
00:36:47,16 --> 00:36:48,33
-搞什么？ -快走
-What the fuck? -Come on, move it.

532
00:36:48,41 --> 00:36:50,33
把手拿开
Get your fucking hands off me!

533
00:36:54,84 --> 00:36:56,46
十一点和十二点…
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

534
00:36:56,55 --> 00:36:59,68
你一点和柯乔伊有约
And don't forget about your 1:00 with Chancellor Joel Klein.

535
00:36:59,76 --> 00:37:02,14
-今天真忙 -市长
-Oh, Madge. What a day... -Your Honor.

536
00:37:02,18 --> 00:37:03,93
麦德琳，你好
Madeleine! How are you?

537
00:37:04,01 --> 00:37:06,56
谢谢你临时抽空接见我
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

538
00:37:06,64 --> 00:37:09,89
-没事了吗？ -没事了
-Sure. Madge, are we through here? -Yes, Mr. Mayor.

539
00:37:10,19 --> 00:37:11,98
这里请
This way, Miss White.

540
00:37:12,60 --> 00:37:16,90
我一向都很乐意参加慈善晚会
I always have time to put on a tux and eat free food for a good cause.

541
00:37:16,98 --> 00:37:18,86
这星期又是什么场合？
Who are we saving this week?

542
00:37:18,90 --> 00:37:20,70
我正在帮…
Well, I'm doing a round of support

543
00:37:20,74 --> 00:37:23,70
裴氏脊髓研究纪念基金会筹备
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund for Spinal Cord Research

544
00:37:23,74 --> 00:37:25,83
募款晚会是下个月
and we're having our annual fundraiser next month.

545
00:37:25,87 --> 00:37:27,87
你大驾光临能助益不少
If you could attend, it would give us such a boost.

546
00:37:27,91 --> 00:37:31,87
我的荣幸，我还能帮什么…
It would be my pleasure. Is there anything else I can do to...

547
00:37:32,62 --> 00:37:34,96
-你他妈的要什么？ -帮一个忙
-What the fuck do you want? -A favor.

548
00:37:35,04 --> 00:37:38,88
-什么样的忙？ -我请你帮的最后一个忙
-No shit. Which kind? -The last one I'll ever ask of you.

549
00:37:39,38 --> 00:37:41,59
最好是这样
That's the kind I had in mind.

550
00:37:41,80 --> 00:37:44,22
你知道人质危机事件
You know about this hostage situation.

551
00:37:44,30 --> 00:37:46,56
这跟你有什么关系？
On my way. What's it to do with you?

552
00:37:46,60 --> 00:37:48,72
我要亲自在场监督
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

553
00:37:48,81 --> 00:37:51,85
我要你带我去告诉指挥官
So, I want you to bring me down there and tell whoever's in charge

554
00:37:51,89 --> 00:37:53,90
让我参与一切行动
to extend me every courtesy.

555
00:37:56,77 --> 00:37:59,11
你发疯了
You're out of your fucking mind.

556
00:37:59,69 --> 00:38:02,40
答应这件事，咱们就扯平
If it was easy, it wouldn't square us, would it?

557
00:38:02,70 --> 00:38:05,87
-这是不可能的事 -天下无难事
-It's impossible. -Nothing's impossible.

558
00:38:05,91 --> 00:38:08,08
一定有人欠你情
You just have to call in a few markers, that's all.

559
00:38:08,16 --> 00:38:10,37
我恐怕会欠别人的情
I may have to give out a few.

560
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:13,50
那你也只好这么做
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

561
00:38:14,88 --> 00:38:16,88
你真是个难缠的婊子
You're a magnificent cunt.

562
00:38:20,26 --> 00:38:21,97
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

563
00:38:25,43 --> 00:38:28,64
对峙局势持续了几个小时
It's been a very tense situation for several hours now.

564
00:38:28,72 --> 00:38:31,10
抢匪和人质的人数
It's unclear how many hostages are inside

565
00:38:31,14 --> 00:38:33,60
仍然不明
and how many robbers police are dealing with.

566
00:38:33,64 --> 00:38:36,94
警方只说一开始是抢案
Officials say this all started out as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,

567
00:38:36,98 --> 00:38:39,90
后来变成人质危机
but has turned into this hostage situation.

568
00:38:39,94 --> 00:38:42,78
谈判专家正在努力想办法
Negotiators are here on the scene, working very hard

569
00:38:42,82 --> 00:38:45,49
但是仍不确定是否有人质受伤
and it's still unclear on any possible injuries.

570
00:38:45,57 --> 00:38:47,83
我们会向大家报告最新消息
Of course, we'll keep you up to date with the very latest

571
00:38:47,91 --> 00:38:50,87
也会继续在现场进行连线报导
and we will remain here on the scene as this all unfolds.

572
00:38:50,95 --> 00:38:52,87
这是目前为止现场的最新消息
That's the latest from here in lower Manhattan.

573
00:38:52,96 --> 00:38:55,67
我是记者远藤珊卓
Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo. Back to you.

574
00:38:55,75 --> 00:38:58,67
人民保母个屁啦，我的头巾呢？
"Protect and serve" my ass. Where's my turban?

575
00:38:59,21 --> 00:39:01,21
没有头巾我什么都不说
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

576
00:39:01,30 --> 00:39:04,38
包头巾是尊敬上帝，我是锡克教徒
It's part of my religion, to cover my head in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

577
00:39:04,47 --> 00:39:05,76
我们会找到头巾
Okay, we'll find your turban.

578
00:39:05,80 --> 00:39:08,14
警察骂我是臭阿拉伯人
Not an Arab, by the way, like your cops called me outside.

579
00:39:08,18 --> 00:39:10,22
你一定是听错了
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

580
00:39:10,31 --> 00:39:12,64
情况很混乱，你没听清楚
There was a lot going on. You were probably disoriented.

581
00:39:12,68 --> 00:39:14,64
-我就没听到 -我听得很清楚
-I didn't hear that. -I heard what I heard.

582
00:39:14,73 --> 00:39:16,81
该说的我会说
I'll give you all the information you want.

583
00:39:16,90 --> 00:39:19,82
我不要冰袋，我要头巾
I don't need this. I need my turban. It's part of my religion.

584
00:39:19,86 --> 00:39:21,94
-我们会把头巾还给你 -我们马上就去找
-We'll get you your turban. -We'll find it for you.

585
00:39:21,98 --> 00:39:24,45
我现在就要
No, no, no. Not "get me." I want my turban now.

586
00:39:24,49 --> 00:39:27,24
你要替人质着想
You just got to start thinking about the people inside the bank now.

587
00:39:27,32 --> 00:39:28,37
现在情况危急
It's a dangerous situation.

588
00:39:28,45 --> 00:39:30,91
告诉我们银行发生什么事
You got to start telling us about what's going on inside the bank.

589
00:39:30,99 --> 00:39:33,41
你被打的事以后再说
We can talk about this later. We'll get an officer to come down.

590
00:39:33,50 --> 00:39:34,96
你可以提出申诉
You can write a formal complaint.

591
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:37,37
现在先处理眼前的问题
But for now, we got to deal with this situation.

592
00:39:37,46 --> 00:39:39,50
你们先打我，然后要我帮忙
First you beat me, and now you want my help.

593
00:39:39,59 --> 00:39:42,25
你得替你的同事着想
You need to start thinking about your coworkers.

594
00:39:42,34 --> 00:39:45,88
我可以替纽约警局向你道歉 但是骂你的人不是我们
I could apologize on behalf of the NYPD, but that was not us. We are detectives.

595
00:39:45,97 --> 00:39:48,01
-我们试着找出… -你们想知道什么？
-We're gonna try and find out... -What do you want to know?

596
00:39:48,09 --> 00:39:50,72
-有几名抢匪？ -四名
-How many were there? -I think there were about four.

597
00:39:50,80 --> 00:39:54,56
-几名人质？ -不知道，二、三十个
-How many hostages? -I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

598
00:39:56,02 --> 00:39:59,98
我受够了，我没有人权吗？
I'm fucking tired of this shit. What happened to my fucking civil rights?

599
00:40:00,02 --> 00:40:02,90
我走到哪里都被骚扰
Why can't I go anywhere without being harassed?

600
00:40:02,98 --> 00:40:05,19
我被挟持当人质、被骚扰
I get thrown out of a bank. I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

601
00:40:05,28 --> 00:40:06,40
到机场搭飞机
I go to the airport.

602
00:40:06,49 --> 00:40:09,28
也一定会被警卫随机搜身
I can't go through security without a "random" selection.

603
00:40:09,36 --> 00:40:11,20
去你的随机啦
Fucking random, my ass. I nearly lost my job...

604
00:40:11,24 --> 00:40:13,58
你一定拦得到计程车
I bet you can get a cab, though.

605
00:40:14,54 --> 00:40:16,54
也只有这个好处
I guess that's one of the perks.

606
00:40:17,16 --> 00:40:19,17
拿冰袋敷脸
Put the ice on your face.

607
00:40:23,55 --> 00:40:26,88
两辆加满油的巴士
"Two buses with full gas tanks. One jumbo jet with full gas tank

608
00:40:26,97 --> 00:40:29,64
“一架加满油的客机和驾驶员”
"and pilots at JFK, parked at the end of runway."

609
00:40:29,72 --> 00:40:31,35
时限是晚上九点
They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,

610
00:40:31,43 --> 00:40:33,89
然后就每小时杀一名人质
then they kill one hostage every hour in front of TV cameras.

611
00:40:33,97 --> 00:40:37,43
“银行放置塑胶炸弹，有必要就会引爆”
"Bank is secured with Semtex. We will demonstrate if necessary."

612
00:40:37,52 --> 00:40:41,40
-别给他飞机 -没有飞机，也许有巴士
-Whatever you do, don't give them a jet. -There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

613
00:40:41,48 --> 00:40:44,15
他不肯谈，什么都没有，连一杯咖啡都不给
Till I talk to them, they get nothing. Not even a cup of coffee.

614
00:40:44,23 --> 00:40:45,36
现在我们慢慢等
For now, we wait.

615
00:40:45,40 --> 00:40:47,86
让他们猜我们在干嘛
Let's let them wonder what we're doing, okay?

616
00:40:47,90 --> 00:40:50,20
这位是寇亚瑟
Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

617
00:40:50,24 --> 00:40:52,87
-他是… -我是董事长
-He's the... -I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

618
00:40:52,91 --> 00:40:56,04
-银行董事长，你要跟他谈吗？ -当然
-Of the bank. You wanna talk to him? -Absolutely.

619
00:40:56,08 --> 00:40:58,75
寇先生，你好，我是费警探
Mr. Case, how are you? I'm Detective Frazier.

620
00:40:58,83 --> 00:41:01,25
你有什么要告诉我们？
Anything in particular you think we should know?

621
00:41:01,29 --> 00:41:05,34
没有，我只是想来帮忙
No. I just wondered if I might be of some assistance.

622
00:41:07,42 --> 00:41:10,43
-他们提出要求吗？ -他们要一架喷射客机
-Have they made any demands? -They want a jet.

623
00:41:11,43 --> 00:41:13,10
我明白了
Oh, I see.

624
00:41:14,97 --> 00:41:17,77
你们要我安排吗？
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

625
00:41:24,31 --> 00:41:26,69
很抱歉，我误解了
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

626
00:41:26,78 --> 00:41:29,19
没关系
That's quite all right, Mr. Case.

627
00:41:29,82 --> 00:41:31,61
有事的话要怎么找你？
Where can we reach you if we need anything?

628
00:41:31,70 --> 00:41:33,57
他们是我的员工
Well, those are my people in there, you know,

629
00:41:33,62 --> 00:41:36,54
我想留下来，我不会碍事
and I would like to stay here for a while. And I won't disturb you.

630
00:41:36,62 --> 00:41:38,62
-我会很安静 -柯巡警
-I'll be very quiet right down... -Sergeant Collins!

631
00:41:38,70 --> 00:41:41,92
一有消息我们会通知你
Mr. Case, we'll try and keep you posted as best we can,

632
00:41:42,00 --> 00:41:43,96
请你先离开
but you're gonna have to excuse us for now, okay?

633
00:41:44,04 --> 00:41:45,75
-这里请 -谢谢
-Right this way, sir. -Thank you very much.

634
00:41:45,79 --> 00:41:46,96
-好 -这里请
-Absolutely. -This way, sir.

635
00:41:47,05 --> 00:41:49,72
-多谢了 -谢谢大家
-Thank you very much. -And thank you all so much.

636
00:41:49,80 --> 00:41:51,26
-谢谢你 -不客气
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

637
00:41:51,30 --> 00:41:52,93
这里请
This way, sir.

638
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:29,55
“五十个人肚子饿要吃东西”
"Fifty hungry people need food now."

639
00:42:40,02 --> 00:42:42,14
窃听器准备好了吗？
All right. Are we ready with the listening devices?

640
00:42:42,23 --> 00:42:44,48
我需要15分钟安装
I'm gonna need 15 minutes once we get the food.

641
00:42:44,52 --> 00:42:46,52
送披萨最好，不能给三明治
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

642
00:42:46,56 --> 00:42:48,52
-她是说真的吗？ -是吗？
-Is she for real? -Are you for real?

643
00:42:48,61 --> 00:42:51,90
十个披萨盒都装上窃听器
Well, if we send in, say, 10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

644
00:42:51,99 --> 00:42:54,78
就能听到一群人交谈
maybe we'll get some conversation if we give them something to group around.

645
00:42:54,86 --> 00:42:56,82
三明治可以带着走来走去
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

646
00:42:56,87 --> 00:42:59,54
不过我可没有五十个窃听器
They can move around and I don't have 50 transmitters.

647
00:42:59,62 --> 00:43:01,75
-这是什么？ -数位录音笔
-What's this? -It's a digital recorder.

648
00:43:01,83 --> 00:43:03,91
按一下就能录半小时
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

649
00:43:04,00 --> 00:43:06,42
-007情报员用的玩意 -拍卖网站就买得到
-James Bond shit. -Well, you can get them on Amazon.

650
00:43:06,50 --> 00:43:09,00
-你要交换一个人质？ -他给我们一个了
-You gonna ask for a hostage? -He already gave us one, didn't he?

651
00:43:09,09 --> 00:43:11,17
再要一个他一定会拒绝
I ask for another one, he says no, then what?

652
00:43:11,26 --> 00:43:13,09
他很清楚他在做什么
No, he knows what he's doing.

653
00:43:13,17 --> 00:43:15,13
给我们一个人质就能换吃的
He gave us a hostage. We'll give him some food.

654
00:43:15,22 --> 00:43:17,39
我不想虚张声势被他逮到
I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

655
00:43:23,02 --> 00:43:26,90
我不戴面罩，要杀要剐尽管来
Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

656
00:43:26,94 --> 00:43:28,52
你想害死大家吗？
Do you wanna get us all killed?

657
00:43:28,61 --> 00:43:30,73
安啦，不会有事的
You wanna relax? What the hell is the difference?

658
00:43:30,82 --> 00:43:33,65
他们正在忙着抢银行
They're out there robbing the bank!

659
00:43:33,74 --> 00:43:36,28
-他被痛扁一顿耶 -闭嘴
-Can't you see they fucked him up? -Shut up.

660
00:43:36,36 --> 00:43:38,37
我们穿成这样不是为了好玩
You think they dressed us like this for fun, puneta?

661
00:43:38,41 --> 00:43:39,74
-我搞不懂 -请闭嘴
-I have no idea -Please shut up.

662
00:43:39,83 --> 00:43:42,08
他们干嘛逼我们穿这玩意？
...why they made us put on all of this crap.

663
00:43:42,12 --> 00:43:45,08
也许是让警察分不出好人坏人
Probably so when the cops break in and try to rescue us

664
00:43:45,16 --> 00:43:47,37
-一古脑把我们都毙了 -天啊
-we all get fucking shot. -Oh, my God!

665
00:43:47,42 --> 00:43:49,59
有够天才，我才不上当
It's a great plan, but, no, thanks.

666
00:43:50,00 --> 00:43:52,17
我叫你闭嘴！放开他！
I told you to shut up! Leave him!

667
00:43:53,71 --> 00:43:56,88
别这样对我，求求你
No! Don't do this to me! Please, don't .

668
00:44:01,22 --> 00:44:05,27
我会照你说的做！救命！
I'll do as you say! No! Help! Help!

669
00:44:20,12 --> 00:44:21,99
求求你，不要
Please, don't ! Don't !

670
00:44:29,42 --> 00:44:31,42
其中一个发号施令
One guy did most of the talking.

671
00:44:32,09 --> 00:44:33,88
其他人都听他的
He told everyone else what to do.

672
00:44:33,96 --> 00:44:36,67
-他们会互相交谈吗？ -我听不见
-So they were talking amongst themselves? -We couldn't hear them.

673
00:44:36,76 --> 00:44:39,34
他们把我们关在房间
They had us in these rooms.

674
00:44:39,84 --> 00:44:42,10
房门关得紧紧的
The doors were locked all the time.

675
00:44:42,14 --> 00:44:44,18
根本不知道他们在干嘛
We didn't know what they were doing.

676
00:44:44,26 --> 00:44:46,98
-你听见什么吗？ -我的耳朵有毛病
-Did you hear anything they said? -I have problems with my hearing.

677
00:44:47,06 --> 00:44:48,85
-原来如此 -我得戴助听器
-I see. -I wear hearing aids.

678
00:44:48,94 --> 00:44:50,65
-在哪儿？ -我耳朵里头
-Where are they? -They're in my ears.

679
00:44:50,73 --> 00:44:51,90
-拿出来 -给我看
-Let's see. -Let me see them.

680
00:44:51,98 --> 00:44:54,57
-给我看，拿出来 -是助听器没错
-Yeah, let's take a look at them. -Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

681
00:44:54,65 --> 00:44:55,94
那是另一个？
That's your other one, there?

682
00:44:55,98 --> 00:44:57,99
颜色怎么不同？
What's the red part, there? What does that do?

683
00:44:58,03 --> 00:45:00,53
颜色不同
They're different colors. You need two different...

684
00:45:00,61 --> 00:45:02,57
才能分辨左右
And to distinguish right from left, also.

685
00:45:02,66 --> 00:45:04,08
-分辨左右 -对
-Distinguish right from left? -Yeah.

686
00:45:04,16 --> 00:45:05,66
或是对错？
Right from wrong.

687
00:45:05,74 --> 00:45:07,20
我不明白
I don't understand.

688
00:45:07,29 --> 00:45:09,67
-史蒂夫？ -什么？
-Steve? -I'm sorry?

689
00:45:09,75 --> 00:45:11,17
-我什么也没说 -噢
-I didn't say anything. -Oh.

690
00:45:11,21 --> 00:45:13,09
你叫史蒂夫吗？
Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

691
00:45:13,17 --> 00:45:15,13
史蒂威？史蒂佛？
Stevie? Steve-O?

692
00:45:15,17 --> 00:45:17,51
-他们要给你多少钱？ -什么？
-How much are they gonna pay you? -I'm sorry?

693
00:45:17,55 --> 00:45:20,13
-你听见了 -我没听见
-You heard me. -No, I didn't .

694
00:45:20,18 --> 00:45:24,01
-他们要给你多少钱？ -谁？
-How much are they going to pay you? -Who's gonna pay me?

695
00:45:24,10 --> 00:45:27,14
-这起抢案你有份吗？ -没有
-Were you involved in this robbery? -Absolutely not.

696
00:45:27,18 --> 00:45:29,48
这件事你有参一脚吗？
Were you involved in this situation?

697
00:45:30,64 --> 00:45:33,02
-什么事？ -别说谎
-What situation? -Don't lie. Don't lie.

698
00:45:51,50 --> 00:45:54,08
如果他给小费，我要留着
If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

699
00:45:54,50 --> 00:45:56,04
-把枪放下 -看那把枪
-Put that gun down! -Check that weapon!

700
00:45:56,13 --> 00:45:58,17
别紧张，冷静点
All right, everybody, relax. Calm down. Calm down.

701
00:45:58,26 --> 00:46:00,17
给我冷静点！
Calm the fuck down!

702
00:46:02,63 --> 00:46:04,18
你好
How you doing?

703
00:46:05,55 --> 00:46:08,93
我是费警探，人质谈判专家
I'm Detective Keith Frazier, Hostage Negotiation Team.

704
00:46:09,73 --> 00:46:11,44
你好吗？
How's it going?

705
00:46:11,98 --> 00:46:15,40
披萨可以吧，已经凉了
Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay. They might be a little cold.

706
00:46:15,73 --> 00:46:18,23
只要拿起电话
Listen, you pick up the phone anytime you want.

707
00:46:18,28 --> 00:46:19,74
都能打给我
It's a direct line to me.

708
00:46:19,78 --> 00:46:21,70
我想跟你谈谈
I would love to talk to you.

709
00:46:27,87 --> 00:46:29,83
很高兴跟你聊天
Nice talking to you.

710
00:46:58,77 --> 00:47:00,90
可恶，是臭俄国佬
Shit. Fucking Russians.

711
00:47:01,11 --> 00:47:04,28
请总部派俄语翻译来
Call Operations. See if they can get a Russian translator over here ASAP.

712
00:47:04,36 --> 00:47:06,12
顺便带几个尸袋来
And get some fucking body bags.

713
00:47:06,20 --> 00:47:07,99
你最好能搞定
I hope you know what you're doing.

714
00:47:08,08 --> 00:47:10,95
要是我的手下得跟他们火拼…
Because if my guys got to shoot it out with those fucking savages...

715
00:47:10,99 --> 00:47:12,75
好啦，米契
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

716
00:47:13,12 --> 00:47:14,83
去问人质
Check with either one of the hostages.

717
00:47:14,92 --> 00:47:18,71
有没有听到俄语或俄国口音
Find out if they heard any Russian or Russian accents when they were in there.

718
00:47:19,21 --> 00:47:20,96
不会有事的
We'll be all right.

719
00:47:38,94 --> 00:47:40,48
不要
No!

720
00:47:42,74 --> 00:47:44,36
趴下来
Down on the floor!

721
00:47:52,04 --> 00:47:54,25
小妞，跟我走
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

722
00:47:56,04 --> 00:47:58,00
别哭，给我闭嘴
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

723
00:48:01,46 --> 00:48:05,22
进去，坐下来，戴上面罩
Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

724
00:48:06,01 --> 00:48:08,34
走吧，波霸
Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

725
00:48:08,39 --> 00:48:11,85
-波霸？你说什么？ -你听到了，闭嘴
-"Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to? -Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

726
00:48:12,14 --> 00:48:14,39
-为什么？ -快走，肥婆
-Why? -Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

727
00:48:14,48 --> 00:48:15,77
肥婆？你在说笑？
"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

728
00:48:15,85 --> 00:48:18,73
闭嘴，小心我扁你
If you don't shut the fuck up, I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

729
00:48:23,03 --> 00:48:25,15
戴上面罩
Put your masks on!

730
00:48:25,19 --> 00:48:27,20
手放在地上
Put your hands on the ground!

731
00:48:27,24 --> 00:48:28,86
好，好
Okay, okay.

732
00:48:29,41 --> 00:48:31,53
手放在地上
On the floor. Hands are on the floor.

733
00:48:36,50 --> 00:48:38,17
戴上面罩
Masks on!

734
00:48:38,42 --> 00:48:40,50
手放在地上
Put your hands on the ground!

735
00:48:42,04 --> 00:48:43,38
走吧，波霸
Come on, boobs, let's go.

736
00:48:43,46 --> 00:48:45,80
坐下来
Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

737
00:48:55,14 --> 00:48:57,27
她排在我前面
She was on line in front of me.

738
00:48:57,73 --> 00:49:00,06
他是这一排的银行行员
He was the teller on my line.

739
00:49:00,15 --> 00:49:03,98
这家伙在我右边，他的儿子在他前面
This guy was to my right and his kid was in front of him.

740
00:49:04,07 --> 00:49:06,03
他在打电动
He was playing with a video game.

741
00:49:06,24 --> 00:49:07,74
我记得她
I remember her.

742
00:49:07,78 --> 00:49:10,16
-为什么？ -大咪咪
-Why do you remember her? -Great tits.

743
00:49:11,74 --> 00:49:16,08
-后来你有看到他们吗？ -我看到她一次
-You remember seeing any of them after? -Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

744
00:49:16,16 --> 00:49:19,67
-你怎么确定？ -波那么大我不会认错
-How are you sure you saw her again? -I could see under the suit.

745
00:49:20,25 --> 00:49:21,83
穿什么都遮不住
Can't hide quality like that.

746
00:49:21,92 --> 00:49:24,42
这家伙差点害死我们
This guy, he almost got us all killed.

747
00:49:24,50 --> 00:49:25,59
怎么说？
How?

748
00:49:25,67 --> 00:49:28,13
八、九个人被关在办公室
They put eight or nine of us in an office for a while.

749
00:49:28,22 --> 00:49:32,26
这家伙耍狠不戴面罩，然后还呛声说…
This guy took off his mask and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

750
00:49:32,34 --> 00:49:34,81
“我才不戴这个臭面罩咧”
"I don't have to wear this damn mask," you know?

751
00:49:34,89 --> 00:49:38,64
他们把他拖出去毒打一顿
So, they come in, pull him out of the room and smack him around a little.

752
00:49:40,10 --> 00:49:42,31
-你有再看到他吗？ -没
-You see him again after that? -No.

753
00:49:43,06 --> 00:49:45,36
-他没事吧？ -看起来没事
-Was he okay? -Seemed fine.

754
00:49:46,23 --> 00:49:47,25
You...

755
00:49:48,28 --> 00:49:52,11
-你认得其他人吗？ -我不确定
-You recognize anyone else from that room? -I can't be sure about the others.

756
00:49:52,61 --> 00:49:54,41
一个都不认得？
No one?

757
00:49:54,45 --> 00:49:57,29
-继续看 -当时我吓个半死
-Why don't you keep looking? -You know, I was terrified.

758
00:49:57,37 --> 00:49:58,70
案发之前
What about before it began?

759
00:49:58,79 --> 00:50:01,12
排队的时候呢？
You didn't look around while you were waiting in line?

760
00:50:01,21 --> 00:50:03,63
我在跟朋友讲电话
I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

761
00:50:07,50 --> 00:50:09,67
你想再替我拍一张吗？
You wanna take another picture?

762
00:50:09,84 --> 00:50:11,93
我可以弯下身捡铅笔
I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

763
00:50:12,80 --> 00:50:14,51
随你们便
Whatever.

764
00:50:14,80 --> 00:50:16,43
这家伙
This guy.

765
00:50:16,97 --> 00:50:18,60
大烂人
Asshole.

766
00:50:39,95 --> 00:50:42,08
搞什么，这不是俄语
What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

767
00:50:43,58 --> 00:50:45,54
那这是什么语言？
No? What the hell is it?

768
00:50:45,75 --> 00:50:48,09
不是波兰话，不是匈牙利话
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

769
00:50:48,46 --> 00:50:50,59
也许是保加利亚话
Bulgarian, maybe.

770
00:50:51,34 --> 00:50:53,59
应该算是中欧语言吧
It's Central European. Sort of.

771
00:50:53,68 --> 00:50:56,10
你是语言专家耶
That's it? I mean, you're the language expert.

772
00:50:56,18 --> 00:50:57,85
才不是咧
What? No.

773
00:50:58,47 --> 00:51:00,68
-你觉得怎样？ -我想…
-What do you think? -Well, okay.

774
00:51:00,93 --> 00:51:02,31
这是纽约
Well, this is New York City.

775
00:51:02,35 --> 00:51:04,23
哪一国人都有
Somebody on the street must know what it is.

776
00:51:04,31 --> 00:51:05,69
热狗小贩一定知道
Probably the hot-dog man.

777
00:51:05,73 --> 00:51:08,44
用喇叭放出来，借过
Berk, play that over the speaker for me. Excuse me.

778
00:51:12,19 --> 00:51:13,74
对不起
Excuse me!

779
00:51:13,82 --> 00:51:17,49
有人知道这是什么语言吗？
Does anybody know what language they're speaking? Anybody?

780
00:51:17,57 --> 00:51:18,87
我知道
Yo, my man.

781
00:51:18,95 --> 00:51:21,25
让这家伙过来
Hey, Phil, let that guy through. Come on.

782
00:51:26,04 --> 00:51:29,04
-你知道他们在讲什么话？ -对，阿尔巴尼亚语
-You know what language they're speaking? -Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

783
00:51:29,13 --> 00:51:32,17
-阿尔巴尼亚语？ -阿尔巴尼亚的阿尔巴尼亚语
-Albanian? -Albanian. From Albania.

784
00:51:35,09 --> 00:51:37,05
我这是在干嘛呀？
What am I doing here?

785
00:51:39,05 --> 00:51:40,85
我被逮捕了吗？
Yo, am I getting arrested for something?

786
00:51:40,89 --> 00:51:43,10
没有，进来
No, you're not getting arrested. Come on. Come on.

787
00:51:44,56 --> 00:51:46,06
哇
Whoa.

788
00:51:46,27 --> 00:51:49,82
-他们在说什么？ -我不知道
-Okay. What are they saying? -I have no idea what they're saying.

789
00:51:49,90 --> 00:51:51,73
你说你会讲阿尔巴尼亚话
You got no idea? I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

790
00:51:51,82 --> 00:51:52,99
我才没这么说
No. I never said I speak Albanian.

791
00:51:53,07 --> 00:51:54,11
你有
You said you spoke Albanian.

792
00:51:54,19 --> 00:51:55,36
我没有
I never said I speak Albanian.

793
00:51:55,40 --> 00:51:56,86
你怎知是阿尔巴尼亚话？
Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

794
00:51:56,91 --> 00:51:58,91
我前妻是阿尔巴尼亚人
My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

795
00:51:58,99 --> 00:52:01,45
她爸妈不会说英文
Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

796
00:52:01,54 --> 00:52:02,91
我完全听不懂
I have no idea what they're saying,

797
00:52:03,00 --> 00:52:05,66
不过百分百是阿尔巴尼亚话
but I'll tell you right now that the language is 100% Albanian.

798
00:52:05,75 --> 00:52:07,25
-百分百？ -百分百
-100% ? -100% .

799
00:52:07,33 --> 00:52:10,17
打给阿尔巴尼亚领事馆
Call the Albanian Consulate. See if they can get somebody over here

800
00:52:10,25 --> 00:52:12,09
找一个翻译来，快点
to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

801
00:52:12,13 --> 00:52:13,80
你留在后面
Okay, you hang out in the back for me, okay?

802
00:52:13,88 --> 00:52:15,51
不是吧
Oh, man, not again.

803
00:52:16,13 --> 00:52:19,64
箱型车是赃车，没采到指纹
Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean. No prints.

804
00:52:19,72 --> 00:52:22,01
-什么线索也没有？ -没有
-Nothing? -Nothing.

805
00:52:22,10 --> 00:52:23,35
阿尔巴尼亚语？
Albanian?

806
00:52:23,43 --> 00:52:26,60
我说过，百分百阿尔巴尼亚语
My man, like I told you, 100% Albanian.

807
00:52:28,94 --> 00:52:30,27
毫无疑问
Undeniable.

808
00:52:43,29 --> 00:52:45,41
-嘿 -谢谢
-Hey. -Thanks.

809
00:53:11,02 --> 00:53:13,27
喂，那混帐东西在那里
Yo, yo, yo. There go that motherfucker right there.

810
00:53:13,36 --> 00:53:15,98
你以为你跑得掉吗？
Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna get away with that shit, didn't you?

811
00:53:16,07 --> 00:53:17,61
这游戏怎么玩？
How does this game work?

812
00:53:17,65 --> 00:53:21,78
干坏事就能得分，像是偷车或是贩毒
You get points for doing dirt, like jacking a car or selling crack.

813
00:53:22,12 --> 00:53:25,58
你被劫车或被干掉就会失分
And you lose points if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

814
00:53:26,12 --> 00:53:27,50
来呀
Come on, baby.

815
00:53:27,58 --> 00:53:30,17
去死吧
Take that! Take this! What? What? What?

816
00:53:30,25 --> 00:53:31,75
你敢呛声，我听不到
Talk shit now! I don't hear you!

817
00:53:31,83 --> 00:53:33,13
杀死模拟人物
Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!

818
00:53:33,17 --> 00:53:35,17
吃这个吧！

819
00:53:35,25 --> 00:53:37,59
你死定了，拜了！
You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!

820
00:53:37,67 --> 00:53:39,22
天啊
Jesus!

821
00:53:39,51 --> 00:53:41,18
这有什么意义？
What's the point of this?

822
00:53:41,26 --> 00:53:44,72
我的偶像五角说过：“要钱不要命”
Like my man 50 says, "Get rich or die tryin'."

823
00:53:45,51 --> 00:53:48,39
抢银行得分才多咧
Yo, you'd get mad points for knocking over the bank.

824
00:53:48,48 --> 00:53:52,48
-你觉得很棒吗？ -对啊，你也想赚钱嘛
-You think that's cool? -Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

825
00:53:56,48 --> 00:53:59,11
吃完了我就带你找爸爸
Finish your slice. I'll take you back to your father.

826
00:54:00,99 --> 00:54:03,20
我得叫他不准你玩这游戏
I got to talk to him about this game.

827
00:54:11,33 --> 00:54:13,54
-好吃吗？ -好吃
-Is it good? -No doubt.

828
00:54:17,13 --> 00:54:18,88
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

829
00:54:19,63 --> 00:54:21,13
酷
Cool.

830
00:54:21,38 --> 00:54:23,39
你很快就能回家
You'll be home soon.

831
00:54:23,55 --> 00:54:25,18
棒呆了
That's whassup.

832
00:54:30,39 --> 00:54:31,52
-先生 -什么事？
-Sir? -Yeah.

833
00:54:31,60 --> 00:54:33,60
-阿尔巴尼亚领事馆不管用 -什么意思？
-No luck with the Albanian Consulate. -What do you mean?

834
00:54:33,69 --> 00:54:36,19
我听不懂，对方好像要钱
I couldn't tell what the guy was talking about. I think he wanted money.

835
00:54:36,27 --> 00:54:38,32
找国务院要等一个月
And I tried the State Department. That takes a month.

836
00:54:38,40 --> 00:54:39,86
好吧
Okay.

837
00:54:39,90 --> 00:54:41,78
-打给她 -你疯啦？
-Call her. -Are you crazy?

838
00:54:41,86 --> 00:54:44,24
-我，恨那婊子 -她会讲阿尔巴尼亚语？
-I hate that bitch. Come on. -You said she speaks Albanian, right?

839
00:54:44,28 --> 00:54:46,53
-她在那儿出生 -打给她
-Yeah, she was born there. -Call her.

840
00:54:46,62 --> 00:54:48,54
我一定会后悔
I'm gonna regret this.

841
00:55:28,91 --> 00:55:30,95
-哪位是费警探？ -我就是
-Who's Detective Frazier? -Right here.

842
00:55:31,04 --> 00:55:33,62
-这是伊兰娜・玛莉亚 -玛莉・亚塔
-I have llina Maria over here. -Miritia.

843
00:55:33,71 --> 00:55:35,17
-你好 -你好
-Oh, how you doing? -Hello.

844
00:55:35,25 --> 00:55:36,79
你好
How you doing?

845
00:55:37,21 --> 00:55:40,13
-这是什么？ -违规停车罚单，帮我注销
-What's this? -Parking tickets. You can fix them?

846
00:55:42,13 --> 00:55:44,30
我尽量想办法
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

847
00:55:44,63 --> 00:55:47,18
请你告诉我们他们在说什么
Can you listen to this and tell us what they're saying?

848
00:55:47,26 --> 00:55:49,14
这里不准吸烟
You can't smoke in here.

849
00:55:52,10 --> 00:55:53,77
尽管抽吧
Shit. Go ahead.

850
00:56:04,07 --> 00:56:06,61
有什么好笑？他们在说什么？
What's so funny? What, you know what they're talking about?

851
00:56:06,70 --> 00:56:09,83
我知道，我也知道是谁
I know what they're talking about. I even know who it is.

852
00:56:09,91 --> 00:56:11,99
你知道他们的名字？
You know who it is? You mean you know their names?

853
00:56:12,08 --> 00:56:13,83
-是谁？ -停车罚单呢？
-Who? I mean, who is it? -Parking tickets?

854
00:56:13,91 --> 00:56:16,46
-搞定了 -那是哈恩为赫克萨
-They're taken care of. Who is it? -It's Enver Hoxha.

855
00:56:16,54 --> 00:56:19,21
-谁？ -阿尔巴尼亚前总统
-Who? -He was the president of Albania.

856
00:56:19,75 --> 00:56:20,79
等等
Wait.

857
00:56:20,88 --> 00:56:23,76
阿尔巴尼亚前总统是抢匪？
You're telling me the former president of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

858
00:56:23,84 --> 00:56:25,09
他早就挂了
Enver Hoxha's dead.

859
00:56:25,17 --> 00:56:28,39
这是录音啦，他在大发厥词，说阿尔巴尼亚人很伟大
That's a tape of him discussing how Albanian people are great people.

860
00:56:28,43 --> 00:56:31,14
都是不死之身，我不会为这个担心的
They are immortal people. I wouldn't worry.

861
00:56:32,77 --> 00:56:34,85
你确定这是录音？
It's a tape. You're sure about that?

862
00:56:34,93 --> 00:56:37,10
我在学校每天都得听
I had to listen to all this nonsense in school.

863
00:56:37,19 --> 00:56:41,48
“共产主义最好，资本主义最坏，还有列宁、马克斯什么的”
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil. Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah."

864
00:56:41,57 --> 00:56:43,48
这是哈恩为赫克萨的录音
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

865
00:56:43,57 --> 00:56:47,32
带她回家吧
Okay. Okay, well, Officer, you can take her home.

866
00:56:47,40 --> 00:56:50,32
下次不要乱停车
And do me a favor, huh? Watch where you park next time, okay?

867
00:56:57,83 --> 00:56:59,33
他们放录音带？
So, they're playing tapes for us now.

868
00:56:59,42 --> 00:57:00,92
他们知道我们在窃听
They knew we were gonna bug them.

869
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:03,63
一点也没错，他们也知道我们如何窃听
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were gonna bug them. And they knew how.

870
00:57:03,71 --> 00:57:05,67
更糟的是，他们要我们窃听
What makes it even worse, they wanted us to bug them

871
00:57:05,76 --> 00:57:07,26
他们故意害我们浪费时间
so they could send us on a wild goose chase.

872
00:57:07,34 --> 00:57:10,22
上次我像这样被搞花了五块钱
Last time I had my johnson pulled that good, it cost me $5.

873
00:57:10,30 --> 00:57:11,97
五块钱？
$5?

874
00:57:12,51 --> 00:57:14,47
墨西哥，别问了
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

875
00:57:16,06 --> 00:57:18,27
你看，去它的
Look at the... Oh, fuck that.

876
00:59:12,42 --> 00:59:14,93
-费警探，幸会 -幸会
-Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you. -My pleasure.

877
00:59:15,01 --> 00:59:16,26
这位是麦德琳・魏特
This is Madeleine White.

878
00:59:16,35 --> 00:59:18,81
-你好，魏小姐 -幸会，警探
-How do you do, Miss White? -It's an honor, Detective.

879
00:59:18,89 --> 00:59:21,48
魏小姐也许能协助你
Miss White may be able to assist you.

880
00:59:21,64 --> 00:59:24,65
太好了，你有什么想法？
Good. Good. What do you have in mind?

881
00:59:24,73 --> 00:59:28,40
她有很大的影响力
She has a certain amount of influence in these matters

882
00:59:28,48 --> 00:59:31,11
我不能跟你多说
for reasons which I can't share with you.

883
00:59:33,49 --> 00:59:35,11
这是什么意思？
What are you trying to say, sir?

884
00:59:35,20 --> 00:59:38,33
他的意思是你的官阶不够高
What the Mayor means is that there are matters at stake here

885
00:59:38,41 --> 00:59:41,25
我不是故意冒犯
that are a little bit above your pay grade. No offense.

886
00:59:41,33 --> 00:59:43,37
他也想帮助你
And he's offering to help you.

887
00:59:44,25 --> 00:59:48,25
那就请市长升我的官
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor to raise my pay grade to the proper level

888
00:59:48,34 --> 00:59:49,80
问题就解决了
and problem solved.

889
00:59:49,88 --> 00:59:52,21
如果你圆滑一点
From what I hear, that would have happened a long time ago

890
00:59:52,34 --> 00:59:55,63
早就升官了，这件事可以商量
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic. But we can certainly discuss it.

891
00:59:55,72 --> 00:59:58,72
我在开玩笑啦，我要靠自己的能力升官
Look, I'm kidding. I mean, I make First Grade when I make First Grade.

892
00:59:58,80 --> 01:00:01,64
你想帮我一把也行
You want to speed that up, I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

893
01:00:01,72 --> 01:00:05,10
你负责侦办的贩毒案
Then there's also the matter of $140,000 that seems to have walked away

894
01:00:05,19 --> 01:00:07,02
有一张14万支票不翼而飞
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

895
01:00:07,10 --> 01:00:08,73
我知道了
Oh, I see.

896
01:00:09,90 --> 01:00:11,90
那件事与我无关
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

897
01:00:13,03 --> 01:00:15,36
狙击手在隔壁大楼的屋顶…
Yeah, Collins, we got snipers in the windows here.

898
01:00:15,40 --> 01:00:18,07
以及窗口等待指令
We got guys in the building next door. Guys up on the roof.

899
01:00:18,20 --> 01:00:20,28
我们也拿到银行平面图
We're trying to get the blueprints for the bank

900
01:00:20,37 --> 01:00:23,16
可以从通风孔进入银行
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft. Maybe we can come down.

901
01:00:27,46 --> 01:00:29,88
-喂？ -阿尔巴尼亚总统吗？
-Well? -Is this the President of Albania?

902
01:00:30,25 --> 01:00:32,21
-我就是 -很好笑
-Speaking. -Pretty funny.

903
01:00:32,30 --> 01:00:35,34
-你不该偷听别人讲话 -你最好习惯
-You shouldn't eavesdrop on people. -Well, you better get used to it, pal.

904
01:00:35,42 --> 01:00:37,43
监狱没有隐私
There's not gonna be much privacy where you're going.

905
01:00:37,51 --> 01:00:38,68
你说的对
You're damn right.

906
01:00:38,76 --> 01:00:41,85
下礼拜我会一边吸饮料
This time next week, I'll be sucking down pina coladas

907
01:00:41,93 --> 01:00:44,77
一边和六个辣妹洗三温暖
in a hot tub with six girls named Amber and Tiffany.

908
01:00:45,02 --> 01:00:48,19
你会和两个彪形大汉洗战斗澡
More like taking a shower with two guys named Jamal and Jesus,

909
01:00:48,27 --> 01:00:50,81
而且更惨的是
if you know what I mean. And here's the bad news,

910
01:00:50,90 --> 01:00:54,03
你吸的绝对是别的东西
that thing you're sucking on, it's not a pina colada.

911
01:00:56,45 --> 01:00:59,99
-也许你就喜欢那调调 -你真的很想惹毛我
-Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh? -You really want to piss me off.

912
01:01:00,45 --> 01:01:01,78
情况是这样
All right, here's where we stand.

913
01:01:01,87 --> 01:01:04,62
你不必向我报告情况
I don't need your fucking status report, Serpico.

914
01:01:04,70 --> 01:01:06,29
让我告诉你吧
I tell you where things stand.

915
01:01:06,37 --> 01:01:08,75
-好 -情况是这样
-Sure, sure. I just meant... -Here's where things stand.

916
01:01:08,79 --> 01:01:10,63
在时限内
You're getting me what I asked you for.

917
01:01:10,71 --> 01:01:12,59
把我要的东西给我
You'll have it ready in the time I gave you

918
01:01:12,67 --> 01:01:15,96
不然就等着看我大开杀戒，了吗？
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do just what I said I would do. Clear?

919
01:01:16,05 --> 01:01:17,93
我了，我正在努力
Very clear. I'm trying to get you what you want.

920
01:01:17,97 --> 01:01:19,80
不过你也要知道
But you got to understand this.

921
01:01:19,89 --> 01:01:23,76
747喷射客机不是说有就有
You know, it's not like the City of New York has 747 s waiting around for days like today.

922
01:01:23,81 --> 01:01:26,18
我知道，你弄不到一架飞机
I understand that if you don't get my plane ready,

923
01:01:26,27 --> 01:01:28,64
-就送一具棺材进来吧 -别这样
-then you might as well send a hearse. -Please.

924
01:01:28,73 --> 01:01:31,15
让我们好好商量该怎么合作
Let's focus on how we can both get what we want, all right?

925
01:01:31,23 --> 01:01:33,65
你没在听
Hey! You're not listening.

926
01:01:35,48 --> 01:01:39,11
我拿到我要的就不会杀人
You get me what I want, I won't kill anyone.

927
01:01:39,66 --> 01:01:41,62
好，我这就去办
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

928
01:01:42,37 --> 01:01:44,79
试着冷静下来
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

929
01:01:44,83 --> 01:01:47,83
-我听起来不够冷静吗？ -你听起来非常冷静
-Don't I sound calm to you? -Yeah, you do.

930
01:01:50,67 --> 01:01:52,42
你太冷静了
Yeah, you do.

931
01:02:45,97 --> 01:02:48,81
-德玛吉先生 -德莫吉
-So, Mr. Damerjian... -Damerjian.

932
01:02:48,85 --> 01:02:50,93
-那是阿尔巴尼亚名字吗？ -叫我肯尼
-Damerjian. Is that Albanian? -Just call me Kenneth.

933
01:02:51,02 --> 01:02:53,27
-肯尼？ -你是阿尔巴尼亚人吗？
-Kenneth? -Is that Albanian or...

934
01:02:53,31 --> 01:02:55,11
亚美尼亚人
It's Armenian.

935
01:02:55,61 --> 01:02:57,48
有什么不同？
What's the difference?

936
01:02:57,82 --> 01:02:59,78
我在皇后区出生
Detective, I was born in Queens.

937
01:03:00,78 --> 01:03:03,99
没去过亚美尼亚或阿尔巴尼亚，只去过一次澳洲
I've never been to Armenia, Albania. I went surfing in Australia once.

938
01:03:04,07 --> 01:03:05,66
我能喝水吗？
Can I have a glass of water?

939
01:03:05,74 --> 01:03:08,08
-你口渴？ -我的喉咙很干
-Are you thirsty? -My throat's parched.

940
01:03:08,16 --> 01:03:09,79
-我不是紧张 -你的喉咙很干？
-I'm not nervous. -Your throat's parched?

941
01:03:09,87 --> 01:03:11,62
-很干 -他的喉咙很干
-My throat's parched. -His throat is parched.

942
01:03:11,71 --> 01:03:13,87
-我只想喝水 -你真逗
-I just want a glass of water. -Oh, shit!

943
01:03:14,83 --> 01:03:16,67
先说出事情经过
When you start telling us what really happened...

944
01:03:16,75 --> 01:03:18,63
-我只想喝水 -他的喉咙很干
-I just want a glass of water. -His throat is parched.

945
01:03:18,67 --> 01:03:20,34
-你要喝咖啡吗？ -不要
-Here. You want some coffee? -No, that's all right.

946
01:03:20,42 --> 01:03:21,67
-我不喝咖啡 -喝吧
-I don't drink that stuff. -No, go ahead.

947
01:03:21,76 --> 01:03:22,97
你知道这是抢案吗？
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

948
01:03:23,01 --> 01:03:25,18
他们掏出枪来才知道
I didn't know they were robbing the bank until they pulled a gun in my face.

949
01:03:25,26 --> 01:03:26,68
所以你才帮他们开门？
Is that why you held the door open for them?

950
01:03:26,76 --> 01:03:28,18
你怎么知道他们是抢匪？
How do you know they robbed the bank?

951
01:03:28,22 --> 01:03:29,35
他们拿枪指着我
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

952
01:03:29,43 --> 01:03:30,77
那并不代表他们是抢匪
That doesn't mean they were robbing the bank.

953
01:03:30,85 --> 01:03:32,48
你有看到他们抢钱吗？
Did they take money? Did you see them take money?

954
01:03:32,56 --> 01:03:36,19
我被关在银行不知道多久
I was in a bank and I was locked up for who knows how long.

955
01:03:36,27 --> 01:03:38,98
-好 -双手被反绑，你明明看到我
-Okay. -Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

956
01:03:39,07 --> 01:03:40,44
你看到我看到你？
You saw me see you?

957
01:03:40,53 --> 01:03:41,86
-你是这个意思吗？ -对
-Is that what you just said? -Yeah.

958
01:03:41,94 --> 01:03:44,36
我被关在房间里，你进来的时候看到我被反绑
I was locked up in the room. You saw me gagged when you came in.

959
01:03:44,41 --> 01:03:47,03
我不是神，我需要时间
Listen, I can't work miracles over here. I'm gonna need more time.

960
01:03:47,12 --> 01:03:49,91
你应该善用我给你的时间
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time that I gave you more efficiently,

961
01:03:49,99 --> 01:03:51,50
就不会有这个问题
you wouldn't be having this problem.

962
01:03:51,58 --> 01:03:54,29
-你要我说什么？ -我的飞机准备好了
-What do you want me to say? -That my plane is ready.

963
01:03:55,00 --> 01:03:56,54
听好
Okay, listen.

964
01:03:57,71 --> 01:04:01,34
我对天发誓，我正在尽力
I promise you, as God is my witness, I'm working on it as hard as I can.

965
01:04:01,42 --> 01:04:03,22
再给我几小时
It's just gonna take a few more hours.

966
01:04:03,26 --> 01:04:04,76
我干嘛再多给你时间？
Why should I give you any more time?

967
01:04:04,84 --> 01:04:07,18
你给我时间就会得到你要的
Well, it's simple. You give me more time, you get what you want.

968
01:04:07,22 --> 01:04:09,35
不然你什么都得不到
You don't give me the time, you don't get what you want.

969
01:04:09,39 --> 01:04:11,27
反正你没任何损失
You got nothing to lose.

970
01:04:11,35 --> 01:04:12,39
食物

971
01:04:13,77 --> 01:04:15,89
我们会送更多食物进去
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

972
01:04:15,98 --> 01:04:18,77
我有个谜题，答对了就给你多一点时间
I got a question for you. You get it right, I give you more time.

973
01:04:18,86 --> 01:04:21,36
-答错呢？ -你知道后果是什么
-And? -You know what happens if you don't .

974
01:04:23,40 --> 01:04:25,40
哪一个比较重？
Which weighs more?

975
01:04:26,20 --> 01:04:29,41
一年经过中央站的火车
All the trains that pass through Grand Central Station in a year,

976
01:04:30,58 --> 01:04:34,12
或是用来印美钞砍的树比较重？
or the trees cut down to print all US currency in circulation?

977
01:04:34,71 --> 01:04:37,21
这是脑筋急转弯问题
Here's a hint. It's a trick question.

978
01:04:39,92 --> 01:04:42,42
搞什么？猜谜游戏吗？
What the hell is that? Playing games now?

979
01:04:42,50 --> 01:04:43,67
火车比较重
It's the trains.

980
01:04:43,76 --> 01:04:46,76
美钞是用棉布不是用纸印的
US money isn't printed on paper at all. It's cotton.

981
01:04:46,84 --> 01:04:48,47
-我听过 -没错
-Yeah, I heard that. -Yeah, that's right.

982
01:04:48,55 --> 01:04:49,89
-好 -根本就不必砍树
-Okay. -So no trees were cut down.

983
01:04:49,93 --> 01:04:52,43
-你确定？ -百分百确定
-Are you sure? -Yeah. 100% .

984
01:04:52,64 --> 01:04:54,22
好吧
Okay.

985
01:04:58,77 --> 01:05:00,06
我有答案了
I got it.

986
01:05:00,11 --> 01:05:02,69
-等一下 -我再打给你
-Wait a second. Wait a second. -I'll call you back.

987
01:05:07,07 --> 01:05:09,32
这是圈套，两者一样重
It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

988
01:05:09,41 --> 01:05:11,87
两者一样重，都没有重量
Tell him they both weigh the same. They both weigh nothing.

989
01:05:11,95 --> 01:05:13,91
是没重量还是一样重？
They both weigh nothing or they both weigh the same?

990
01:05:13,95 --> 01:05:15,08
两者一样重
Tell him they both weigh the same.

991
01:05:15,16 --> 01:05:16,75
跟他说一样重，就这么说
Tell him they both weigh the same. Do it now.

992
01:05:16,83 --> 01:05:18,79
都一样重，知道了
They both weigh the same. Got it.

993
01:05:22,67 --> 01:05:25,42
-怎样？ -它们都一样重
-Well? -They both weigh the same.

994
01:05:25,46 --> 01:05:27,47
这次我要三明治
This time, send sandwiches.

995
01:05:28,38 --> 01:05:31,35
不错，这家伙疯了
That's pretty good. This guy's nuts.

996
01:05:31,43 --> 01:05:33,76
他说“中央站”
He said, "Grand Central Station."

997
01:05:34,01 --> 01:05:36,68
中央车站才是火车站
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

998
01:05:36,77 --> 01:05:39,44
-中央站是邮局 -邮局
-Grand Central Station is the post office. -Is the post office.

999
01:05:39,48 --> 01:05:40,81
-他错了 -谁？
-He's wrong. -Who's wrong?

1000
01:05:40,85 --> 01:05:44,11
抢匪呀，火车不会经过中央车站
Perp One. Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

1001
01:05:44,82 --> 01:05:46,19
那是火车的终点站
It's the last stop for every train.

1002
01:05:46,28 --> 01:05:49,11
-地铁列车呢？ -北线地铁会经过中央车站
-What about the subway? They run through. -Metro-North goes there.

1003
01:05:49,15 --> 01:05:51,12
-你知道什么？ -北线地铁会经过那儿
-How the fuck do you know? -Metro-North goes there!

1004
01:05:51,16 --> 01:05:52,66
那是北线地铁的起点啦
No. Metro-North starts there.

1005
01:05:52,74 --> 01:05:54,83
你们到底在说什么？
What are you guys talking about? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1006
01:05:54,91 --> 01:05:57,70
-北线地铁会经过那儿 -去买三明治吧
-Metro-North goes through! -Let's just get the sandwiches.

1007
01:05:58,58 --> 01:06:02,13
-北线地铁… -可是他说经过耶
-Metro-North... -Deal is, he said, "Passes through."

1008
01:06:02,21 --> 01:06:04,34
北线地铁会经过那儿呀
Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up there, though.

1009
01:06:04,42 --> 01:06:06,80
别吵了，这不重要
Look, shut up. It doesn't matter, anyway.

1010
01:06:06,84 --> 01:06:09,97
他说的话跟他的意思不同
I know what he meant. What he said is one thing, but what he meant is another.

1011
01:06:10,05 --> 01:06:12,26
-这是个问题 -三明治
-Yeah. That's always a problem, isn't it? -Sandwiches.

1012
01:06:12,34 --> 01:06:14,01
我这就去
I'm on it, I'm on it.

1013
01:06:16,31 --> 01:06:19,48
我好想吃犹太热狗喝啤酒
You know, right now I could go for a nice kosher hot dog and a beer.

1014
01:06:19,52 --> 01:06:21,65
我本来要去看大都会职棒赛
I had Met tickets tonight. And Pedro's pitching!

1015
01:06:21,73 --> 01:06:23,48
反正他们会输得很惨
They're gonna get their asses kicked anyway.

1016
01:06:23,52 --> 01:06:26,28
-没错 -幸好我们没被拆散
-Tell me about it. I'm better off here. -I'm glad they didn't separate us.

1017
01:06:26,36 --> 01:06:29,03
-他们是恐怖份子吗？ -他们是抢匪啦
-Do you think they're terrorists? -They're robbers, not terrorists.

1018
01:06:29,11 --> 01:06:30,78
你怎么知道？搞不好是基地组织
How do you know? They could be Al-Qaeda.

1019
01:06:30,86 --> 01:06:32,53
相信我，我很有研究
Trust me. I've studied these things.

1020
01:06:32,61 --> 01:06:34,66
-你是以色列情报局干员吗？ -我以前是律师
-What are you, Mossad? -No. I was a lawyer.

1021
01:06:34,74 --> 01:06:37,75
现在是哥伦比亚大学法学院教授，教种族屠杀、奴工
Now I teach courses at Columbia Law on genocide, slave labor,

1022
01:06:37,83 --> 01:06:39,62
-和战争赔偿 -那…
-war reparation claims. -Mira.

1023
01:06:39,71 --> 01:06:43,08
-结束后我能告任何人吗？ -当然
-Can I sue anybody when this is over? -Oh, sure. Go nuts.

1024
01:06:43,38 --> 01:06:45,17
申请国赔吧
Go meshuga.

1025
01:06:47,71 --> 01:06:49,80
这会是个不错的屎坑
Now that's a good looking shithole.

1026
01:07:00,02 --> 01:07:01,69
-喂？ -宝贝，你好吗？
-Hello? -Hey, baby, how you doing?

1027
01:07:01,77 --> 01:07:03,81
我好担心，你要回家吗？
Baby, I'm worried about you. You coming home?

1028
01:07:03,90 --> 01:07:05,36
就快了
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

1029
01:07:05,44 --> 01:07:07,98
今晚不行，不用等我
It's gonna be a long night, though, so don't wait up for me.

1030
01:07:08,07 --> 01:07:09,53
我不能去吗？
Why don't you let me come down there?

1031
01:07:09,61 --> 01:07:12,24
我不想被你分心
Because I don't want to be distracted by you, that's why.

1032
01:07:12,32 --> 01:07:15,57
如果我去执勤你就会看到我
Well, if you're still there when I come on duty in the morning, you will see me.

1033
01:07:15,66 --> 01:07:18,74
-我等不及了 -还好吧？
-I cannot wait. I cannot wait. -So, how you doing?

1034
01:07:19,08 --> 01:07:21,79
还好，两名人质被放出来
It's all right. We got a couple of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1035
01:07:21,87 --> 01:07:25,33
-我说的是你 -我很好
-No, no. How you doing? -I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

1036
01:07:25,42 --> 01:07:29,13
市长在电视上说你表现得很好，我也看到你了
Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

1037
01:07:29,21 --> 01:07:30,84
-真的假的？ -真的
-You saw me on TV? -Yeah.

1038
01:07:30,92 --> 01:07:33,38
-我帅不帅？ -超帅的
-How'd I look? -You looked good, baby. Real good.

1039
01:07:33,47 --> 01:07:36,14
-我得走了 -好
-All right, listen. I got to go. -All right. Hey.

1040
01:07:36,60 --> 01:07:39,10
-小心点 -我会的，我爱你
-Keep your head down. -All right, I will. Love you.

1041
01:07:40,81 --> 01:07:42,39
来吧
Come on.

1042
01:07:44,94 --> 01:07:47,48
你知道基本规规吧？
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1043
01:07:48,11 --> 01:07:50,94
-别担心 -当警察一定会担心
-There's no need to worry, Detective. -I get paid to worry, okay?

1044
01:07:51,03 --> 01:07:52,65
我要你看着我
I just need you to look me in the eye

1045
01:07:52,74 --> 01:07:56,41
告诉我你了解我们同意的事
and make me believe that you understand everything we talked about.

1046
01:07:56,45 --> 01:07:58,12
-我了解 -好
-I understand. -Okay.

1047
01:07:58,20 --> 01:08:00,12
我们永远记得

1048
01:08:03,29 --> 01:08:05,21
有人想跟你讲话
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1049
01:08:07,71 --> 01:08:09,25
-喂？ -你是哪位？
-Hello? -Who is this?

1050
01:08:09,34 --> 01:08:11,34
我的名字不重要
Let's not get into any names.

1051
01:08:11,42 --> 01:08:13,84
-我能给你什么才重要 -你能给我什么？
-What matters is what I can offer you. -And what's that?

1052
01:08:13,92 --> 01:08:16,43
如果你能保护某些利益
Well, if I can be assured that certain interests are protected,

1053
01:08:16,47 --> 01:08:18,68
我就能帮你拿到你想要的
I might be able to help you get what you came for.

1054
01:08:18,80 --> 01:08:20,47
不太可能
I doubt that.

1055
01:08:21,18 --> 01:08:24,14
你想保护的利益是什么？
Tell me about these interests that you are trying to protect.

1056
01:08:24,23 --> 01:08:25,89
让我来担心这件事
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1057
01:08:25,98 --> 01:08:29,48
你到底想要什么？
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out of all this?

1058
01:08:29,69 --> 01:08:31,65
-发大财 -当然
-Rich, of course. -Of course.

1059
01:08:31,69 --> 01:08:34,15
也许你没有发横财的命
But you may have bitten off more than you can chew.

1060
01:08:34,19 --> 01:08:37,07
-怎么说？ -我不方便在电话上谈
-How? -I can't discuss that on the phone.

1061
01:08:37,32 --> 01:08:39,58
-你替银行做事？ -不是
-You work for the bank? -No.

1062
01:08:40,03 --> 01:08:41,99
你也不是警察？
And you're not a cop.

1063
01:08:42,16 --> 01:08:43,70
没错
That's right.

1064
01:08:45,21 --> 01:08:46,83
进来吧
Come on in.

1065
01:08:50,84 --> 01:08:52,21
交易街

1066
01:08:52,30 --> 01:08:53,71
汉诺瓦街
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1067
01:08:53,80 --> 01:08:55,34
你只有十分钟
If you're not out before the lights come back on,

1068
01:08:55,42 --> 01:08:57,18
时间到了不出来

1069
01:08:57,26 --> 01:08:58,84
就待在里头吧
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1070
01:08:58,93 --> 01:09:01,39
-你不必威胁我 -并没有
-You don't need to threaten me. -That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1071
01:09:01,47 --> 01:09:04,60
这整件事已经超出我的理解范围，如果你敢整我…
I know this game is a mile over my head, but I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1072
01:09:04,68 --> 01:09:06,81
我只会交朋友，不会树敌
I got where I am by collecting friends, not enemies.

1073
01:09:06,89 --> 01:09:08,52
相信我
Trust me, okay?

1074
01:09:09,27 --> 01:09:11,02
自求多福吧
You're on your own.

1075
01:09:36,59 --> 01:09:38,88
你凭什么认为我需要帮助？
What makes you think I need help?

1076
01:09:39,89 --> 01:09:42,22
外头有一百个警察
Well, the hundred people outside, for starters.

1077
01:09:42,39 --> 01:09:43,72
这不是问题
It's not a problem.

1078
01:09:43,76 --> 01:09:46,27
他们才不会替你弄到飞机
And they're fueling your jet right now as we speak.

1079
01:09:47,73 --> 01:09:49,69
你不会这么傻吧
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1080
01:09:50,77 --> 01:09:52,52
我的想法是
Here's what I'm thinking.

1081
01:09:52,65 --> 01:09:55,19
现在投降，我保证…
If you give up now, I can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1082
01:09:55,28 --> 01:09:57,49
你只要坐三、四年牢
I'm thinking three years, four years at the most.

1083
01:09:57,57 --> 01:09:58,65
你这么有办法？
You can arrange that?

1084
01:09:58,74 --> 01:10:00,78
你没伤害人质或抢走钱
Well, you haven't hurt anyone or stolen anything,

1085
01:10:00,86 --> 01:10:03,03
当然没问题
so yes, as a matter of fact, I can.

1086
01:10:03,70 --> 01:10:06,12
-这还不够 -我还没说完
-It's not good enough. -Well, I wasn't finished.

1087
01:10:06,75 --> 01:10:09,67
等你出狱就会有两百万元
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1088
01:10:09,96 --> 01:10:12,25
是吗？怎么会？
Will I? How?

1089
01:10:12,29 --> 01:10:15,50
你一出狱就会拿到钱
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be waiting for you when you get out.

1090
01:10:15,59 --> 01:10:17,13
谢了
Thanks.

1091
01:10:17,59 --> 01:10:19,13
不过敬谢不敏
But no, thanks.

1092
01:10:19,22 --> 01:10:22,43
这是很好的条件
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

1093
01:10:22,51 --> 01:10:24,93
你并没有其它选择
I really don't think you have much in the way of alternatives.

1094
01:10:24,97 --> 01:10:28,98
跟我谈谈你要保护的利益
Why don't you talk to me about these interests that you're in here to protect?

1095
01:10:29,10 --> 01:10:30,73
-我不能谈 -我可以
-I'm afraid I can't . -I can.

1096
01:10:30,81 --> 01:10:32,86
让我说个故事给你听
Let me tell you a story.

1097
01:10:35,07 --> 01:10:39,19
二次大战期间，有一个美国人替瑞士银行做事
During World War ll, there was an American working for a bank in Switzerland.

1098
01:10:40,61 --> 01:10:43,12
我不说你也知道在这段时期
Now, I don't need to tell you that this period in history

1099
01:10:43,20 --> 01:10:46,12
这种没道德良知的投机份子很多
was rife with opportunity for people of low morals.

1100
01:10:46,16 --> 01:10:47,62
就跟这个人一样
People like this man.

1101
01:10:47,66 --> 01:10:49,41
颁发给寇亚瑟终生成就奖
He used his position with the Nazis to enrich himself while all around him

1102
01:10:49,46 --> 01:10:52,96
他利用和纳粹的关系赚大钱

1103
01:10:53,04 --> 01:10:55,59
眼睁睁看着无辜百姓被剥夺一切
people were being stripped of everything they owned.

1104
01:10:57,13 --> 01:11:01,13
他用这笔黑心钱成立银行
Then he used his blood money to start a bank.

1105
01:11:01,22 --> 01:11:02,76
你…
Now,

1106
01:11:03,97 --> 01:11:06,81
是不是刚好替这个人做事？
does this sound like it might be the man you work for?

1107
01:11:07,72 --> 01:11:10,23
还是我讲的都是屁话？
Or am I just whistling Dixie out of my ass?

1108
01:11:10,98 --> 01:11:13,19
-咱们心照不宣 -很好
-I believe we understand each other. -Good.

1109
01:11:15,06 --> 01:11:16,98
你到底能为我做什么？
So, what the hell can you do for me

1110
01:11:17,02 --> 01:11:20,74
我知道的比你多，计划完全无缺
since I clearly know more than you do, and I've planned this to perfection?

1111
01:11:20,82 --> 01:11:25,03
相信我，我可以改变你的计划
Believe me, if I need to, I can change your entire program.

1112
01:11:25,12 --> 01:11:27,20
只要你不要成为我的问题
So, the sooner that you stop being my problem

1113
01:11:27,28 --> 01:11:30,79
而是我的解答，你就比较好过
and you start becoming my solution, the better off you'll be.

1114
01:11:31,16 --> 01:11:33,37
-你要什么？ -两分钟
-What is it you want? -Two minutes.

1115
01:11:33,46 --> 01:11:36,25
我只要到保险库拿一个保险箱的东西
The safety deposit box room. I just need to go to one box.

1116
01:11:38,63 --> 01:11:40,59
你在找这玩意吗？
Looking for this?

1117
01:11:41,51 --> 01:11:44,13
这对你的老板非常不利
This could be very embarrassing to your employer.

1118
01:11:44,97 --> 01:11:47,14
他早该把它毁了
He should have destroyed this a long time ago.

1119
01:11:47,18 --> 01:11:49,43
但是却没有，现在是我的
He didn't , so now it's mine.

1120
01:11:51,60 --> 01:11:54,56
如果有一天我被逮捕
Now, if the day ever comes where I have to stand before a judge

1121
01:11:54,65 --> 01:11:56,52
接受审判
and account for what I did here,

1122
01:11:56,61 --> 01:11:58,98
你和你老板要尽全力帮助我
you and your boss will do whatever it takes to help me.

1123
01:12:00,78 --> 01:12:02,90
你带着信封走出去
You get out of here with that envelope,

1124
01:12:03,70 --> 01:12:05,86
我们就会给你一大笔钱
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1125
01:12:06,20 --> 01:12:07,49
我会记得这一点
I'll keep that in mind.

1126
01:12:07,53 --> 01:12:10,49
你到底打算怎么出去？
You're not gonna tell me how you're planning to get out of here, are you?

1127
01:12:10,54 --> 01:12:13,37
直接走出大门，还有问题吗？
I'm gonna walk right out the front door. Anything else?

1128
01:12:13,87 --> 01:12:16,50
-你怎么知道这件事？ -这不重要
-How did you know about all this? -Doesn't matter.

1129
01:12:16,58 --> 01:12:20,05
所有的谎言和恶行都会被揭穿
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1130
01:12:20,50 --> 01:12:23,67
只能遮掩一时，不能永远逃避
You can cover them up for a while, but they don't go away.

1131
01:12:23,92 --> 01:12:26,22
-罪有应得？ -没错
-Murder will out? -Precisely.

1132
01:12:27,09 --> 01:12:29,43
我还是不知道你的目的
Well, I still don't get what you're doing here.

1133
01:12:29,51 --> 01:12:31,14
是吗？
Really?

1134
01:12:32,14 --> 01:12:33,68
很好
Good.

1135
01:12:37,69 --> 01:12:38,81
我们谈过话
So, we spoke.

1136
01:12:38,90 --> 01:12:40,61
我要知道更多
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me more than that.

1137
01:12:40,69 --> 01:12:42,36
-让一下 -是的
-Let me have this window, fellows. -Yes, sir.

1138
01:12:42,40 --> 01:12:45,24
我跟他说既然他还没杀人
I told him that, well, since he hadn't killed anyone,

1139
01:12:45,32 --> 01:12:48,28
只要投降就能从轻发落
it wasn't too late to surrender and get off with a lighter sentence.

1140
01:12:48,37 --> 01:12:50,03
然后呢？
And?

1141
01:12:50,16 --> 01:12:52,08
差不多就这样
And that was basically it.

1142
01:12:53,41 --> 01:12:55,46
别人把我当白痴
You know, I don't ordinarily get offended

1143
01:12:55,54 --> 01:12:58,75
我通常不会生气，不过你太超过了
the first time somebody treats me like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1144
01:12:58,83 --> 01:13:02,42
你并不是跟他说他知道的事实
Now, I know you did not go in there to tell this guy something he already knew.

1145
01:13:02,50 --> 01:13:04,26
老实跟我说
Talk to me.

1146
01:13:04,38 --> 01:13:05,47
听好
Look, Detective.

1147
01:13:05,55 --> 01:13:08,05
我并没有答应告诉你一切
Our arrangement doesn't include me giving you a detailed explanation.

1148
01:13:08,09 --> 01:13:09,89
你要老实说
I say it does, okay?

1149
01:13:10,26 --> 01:13:11,68
我可没被你收买
Okay, you don't own me.

1150
01:13:11,76 --> 01:13:14,93
我自己可以面对风纪组调查
This check-cashing thing, this coke bust, I can face that on my own.

1151
01:13:15,02 --> 01:13:17,56
我很清楚我没有做错事
I know what I did and what I didn't do.

1152
01:13:17,60 --> 01:13:20,11
-快说吧 -你能够保密？
-Talk to me. -Off the record?

1153
01:13:20,15 --> 01:13:23,65
和你有关的都很神秘，说吧
"Off the..." Everything about you is off the record. Just talk to me.

1154
01:13:24,44 --> 01:13:26,74
-我开了一个条件给他 -好
-Well, I gave him an incentive. -Okay.

1155
01:13:26,90 --> 01:13:30,91
-他有没有接受？ -没有，他说他会考虑
-Did he go for it? -No. But I'd say he's considering it.

1156
01:13:32,28 --> 01:13:34,12
他很聪明，对吧？
He's smart, isn't he?

1157
01:13:34,20 --> 01:13:36,33
-他自以为他很聪明 -对
-He thinks he is. -Yeah.

1158
01:13:36,41 --> 01:13:39,00
他跟你一样是名校出身？
One of your types, like the lvy League type?

1159
01:13:39,63 --> 01:13:42,29
-他的确受过良好教育 -我就是这个意思
-Clearly well educated. -That's what I'm talking about.

1160
01:13:42,38 --> 01:13:44,34
我就是这个意思
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1161
01:13:44,55 --> 01:13:48,30
你的谈吐和思想都跟他很像 你认为他会怎么做？
You talk like him, so think like him. What do you think he's gonna do?

1162
01:13:50,18 --> 01:13:52,60
-他不会杀人 -为什么？
-Well, he's not gonna kill anyone. -How do you know?

1163
01:13:52,64 --> 01:13:55,14
-他不是杀人犯 -你怎么知道？
-Because he's not a murderer. -How do you know?

1164
01:13:55,52 --> 01:13:57,68
杀人犯通常不知道
I got news for you. Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1165
01:13:57,77 --> 01:13:59,48
自己会杀人
weren't murderers until they killed somebody.

1166
01:13:59,56 --> 01:14:02,77
人被逼到困境什么事都做得出来
You never know what a person will do until you push him into a corner.

1167
01:14:03,82 --> 01:14:06,24
你并没有把他逼到困境
But it doesn't seem like you've pushed him into a corner.

1168
01:14:06,32 --> 01:14:09,70
没错，是他把自己逼到困境
It doesn't , does it? Seems more like he chose the corner.

1169
01:14:11,32 --> 01:14:12,99
你说的对
You're right.

1170
01:14:13,62 --> 01:14:15,58
你的事办完了吗？
So, you through?

1171
01:14:16,20 --> 01:14:18,50
-对，你要赶我走了？ -没错
-I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed? -Yes, I am.

1172
01:14:18,54 --> 01:14:21,04
你有名片吗？我可能需要打给你
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

1173
01:14:21,75 --> 01:14:24,67
不要生气
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1174
01:14:24,84 --> 01:14:26,42
你付不起我的费用
I don't think you can afford me.

1175
01:14:26,51 --> 01:14:29,93
你也别生气，去你的
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White. Kiss my black ass, okay?

1176
01:14:30,63 --> 01:14:34,81
说话小心点，我可不是好惹的
Careful, Detective Frazier. My bite's much worse than my bark.

1177
01:14:40,85 --> 01:14:42,94
-布莱恩，你几岁？ -八又四分之三
-So, how old are you, Brian? -Eight and three-quarters.

1178
01:14:43,02 --> 01:14:45,61
八又四分之三，很大
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1179
01:14:46,82 --> 01:14:48,94
-你害怕吗？ -不怕
-Were you scared in there? -No.

1180
01:14:49,03 --> 01:14:51,66
-一点都不怕？ -对，我来自布鲁克林
-No? Not at all, huh? -Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1181
01:14:51,74 --> 01:14:53,37
布鲁克林？
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

1182
01:14:53,45 --> 01:14:55,16
-我什么都不怕 -是吗？
-Guns don't scare me. -They don't scare you?

1183
01:14:55,20 --> 01:14:56,66
-你很勇敢？ -对
-Brave, too, huh? -Yeah.

1184
01:14:56,70 --> 01:15:00,04
拿枪的人有没有说什么？
So the guys that had the guns, do you remember them saying anything?

1185
01:15:00,29 --> 01:15:02,21
-有 -他说什么？
-Yeah. -What'd they say?

1186
01:15:02,25 --> 01:15:03,75
他问我在玩什么游戏
They asked me about my game.

1187
01:15:03,83 --> 01:15:06,42
-谁？ -那个抢匪呀，猪头
-Who did? -The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1188
01:15:07,17 --> 01:15:08,88
儿子，别骂人
Son, be respectful.

1189
01:15:08,96 --> 01:15:11,72
好吧，他是头头吗？
Okay, Brooklyn. But it... Was he the one in charge?

1190
01:15:11,80 --> 01:15:13,09
好
-Uh-huh. -Okay.

1191
01:15:13,18 --> 01:15:15,80
你不记得别的事？
And you don't remember anything else?

1192
01:15:15,97 --> 01:15:17,60
他很高
He was kind of tall.

1193
01:15:18,31 --> 01:15:19,52
戴了面罩
He had a mask.

1194
01:15:19,56 --> 01:15:23,52
布莱恩，你认得出他吗？
Brian, you think you can recognize him in any of these pictures?

1195
01:15:24,52 --> 01:15:26,82
慢慢来，仔细看
Take your time. Have a good look.

1196
01:15:27,36 --> 01:15:30,03
仔细看这些照片
Let's keep that over there. Just take a look.

1197
01:15:36,58 --> 01:15:39,79
-他们戴了面罩看起来都一样 -没错
-With the mask, they look all the same. -It's true.

1198
01:15:41,54 --> 01:15:44,50
戴了面罩看起来都一样
With the mask, they all look the same. That's right, Brian.

1199
01:15:44,58 --> 01:15:47,92
抢劫杂货店未遂
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

1200
01:15:48,21 --> 01:15:51,59
抢银行算是很大的进步
Well, this was a real step up for a small-timer like you, huh?

1201
01:15:52,38 --> 01:15:54,22
你真有一套，帕罗
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1202
01:15:54,26 --> 01:15:57,85
我叫保罗，不是帕罗
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo, okay?

1203
01:15:58,06 --> 01:15:59,68
对不起
Excuse me.

1204
01:16:00,31 --> 01:16:02,48
-吃口香糖吗？ -不要
-You want some gum? -No.

1205
01:16:02,94 --> 01:16:04,56
而且不是我干的
And second, I didn't do it, all right?

1206
01:16:04,65 --> 01:16:07,19
我年轻的时候误入歧途
What? I made a few mistakes when I was a kid.

1207
01:16:07,27 --> 01:16:10,57
我的朋友抢劫我刚好也在
I was out with some friends and they held up a liquor store.

1208
01:16:11,65 --> 01:16:13,57
我该怎么办？
What was I supposed to do?

1209
01:16:15,28 --> 01:16:17,41
你是不知民间疾苦的花花大少？
Where'd you grow up, you Wassa Wassa, Park Avenue?

1210
01:16:17,49 --> 01:16:20,04
-花什么？ -花花大少
-What's that? Wassa what? What'd you say? -Wassa Wassa.

1211
01:16:21,37 --> 01:16:23,62
我看你也不像
You know, a person that don't come to your neighborhood.

1212
01:16:23,71 --> 01:16:26,00
监狱西班牙话怎么说？
How do you say "Rikers Island" in Spanish?

1213
01:16:26,08 --> 01:16:27,84
这两个呢？
What about these two?

1214
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:29,63
有印象吗？
That ring a bell?

1215
01:16:29,71 --> 01:16:31,92
这两个？没有
These two? No.

1216
01:16:31,96 --> 01:16:33,26
-完全没有？ -没有
-Nothing? -Nothing.

1217
01:16:33,30 --> 01:16:34,76
你不觉得他们可疑吗？
Don't they look suspicious to you?

1218
01:16:34,80 --> 01:16:38,26
你不想知道他们是谁？
I mean, I would think that you would want to know who they are.

1219
01:16:38,55 --> 01:16:39,60
不想
No.

1220
01:16:39,64 --> 01:16:41,35
-谢谢你的合作 -谢谢
-Well, thank you very much. -Thank you.

1221
01:16:41,43 --> 01:16:44,14
你对钻石知道多少？
Hey, just out of curiosity do you know anything about diamonds?

1222
01:16:44,23 --> 01:16:46,27
不少，你需要什么？
A bit. What do you need?

1223
01:16:46,35 --> 01:16:48,65
一只钻戒要多少钱？
What do you think a guy like me should pay for a diamond ring?

1224
01:16:48,73 --> 01:16:50,69
这要看是几克拉
Depends. How many carats?

1225
01:16:50,77 --> 01:16:52,78
找我侄子
If you'd like, I could give you my nephew's number.

1226
01:16:52,82 --> 01:16:54,24
-好 -他会给你打折
-Okay. -You'll get a very good deal.

1227
01:16:54,32 --> 01:16:56,28
底下是什么？
What do you have on underneath?

1228
01:16:56,49 --> 01:16:58,70
-什么？ -你的衣服底下穿什么？
-Excuse me? -Underneath your painter's coat?

1229
01:16:58,78 --> 01:17:00,95
-你底下穿什么？ -小可爱
-What do you have on underneath? -Clothing.

1230
01:17:01,03 --> 01:17:03,16
让我们看
Could you show us, please?

1231
01:17:07,42 --> 01:17:09,46
你和另一个女人
You see, there's just you and one other woman

1232
01:17:09,50 --> 01:17:12,13
符合女嫌犯特征
that fit the physical description of the female suspect.

1233
01:17:12,17 --> 01:17:13,96
什么特征？
What's that?

1234
01:17:14,84 --> 01:17:18,14
身高、年龄还有…
It's your height, your age, and your...

1235
01:17:19,01 --> 01:17:20,39
罩杯大小
Your cup size.

1236
01:17:20,47 --> 01:17:23,93
我违反了第34条DD条款吗？
So, I violated Section 34 double-D?

1237
01:17:24,02 --> 01:17:25,93
是不是这意思？
That's what you're telling me?

1238
01:17:29,56 --> 01:17:32,82
这白痴真以为会有飞机吗？
How dumb do these morons have to be to think they're gonna get a plane?

1239
01:17:32,86 --> 01:17:34,03
他不是白痴
This guy's no moron.

1240
01:17:34,11 --> 01:17:36,82
不只是他，每一个挟持人质者
I don't just mean him. Any hostage taker.

1241
01:17:38,24 --> 01:17:40,87
慕尼黑奥运那些恐怖份子
Those ragheads at the Munich Olympics.

1242
01:17:41,33 --> 01:17:42,95
他们上得了飞机吗？
Who the fuck ever got a plane?

1243
01:17:43,04 --> 01:17:45,66
难道他不知道吗？
Shit, and these days? This guy doesn't know that?

1244
01:17:45,75 --> 01:17:49,46
这里戒备深严，狙击手在屋顶…
The area is flooded with law enforcement right now. Snipers are on rooftops...

1245
01:17:49,54 --> 01:17:50,83
你在干嘛？
What you doing there, Keith?

1246
01:17:50,88 --> 01:17:52,67
他要飞机我就给他飞机
He wants a plane. I'm gonna give him a plane.

1247
01:17:52,71 --> 01:17:55,51
-你不遵守谈判手册？ -我就是觉得不对劲
-What happened to playing it by the book? -That's what's bugging me.

1248
01:17:55,55 --> 01:17:59,89
他们好像也看过谈判手册
It's like the other team read the book, too, and they know exactly what we're gonna do.

1249
01:18:02,89 --> 01:18:06,39
从头到尾都不是我们在拖延时间
This whole time, we're trying to stall him, right?

1250
01:18:06,48 --> 01:18:08,27
而是他们在拖延时间
Wrong. They're the ones that are stalling.

1251
01:18:08,35 --> 01:18:10,77
什么狗屁谜语、阿尔巴尼亚录音
Think about it. The bullshit questions, the Albanian thing...

1252
01:18:10,85 --> 01:18:12,36
这代表什么？
So, you're saying he what?

1253
01:18:12,40 --> 01:18:15,53
他要给我们更多时间，他提出要求和时限
I'm saying that he wants to give us more time. He makes demands.

1254
01:18:16,19 --> 01:18:19,45
我们尽量拖，他就给更多时间
He gives us deadlines. We stall. Then he gives us more time.

1255
01:18:19,53 --> 01:18:20,91
他一点都不急
I don't think he's in a rush.

1256
01:18:20,95 --> 01:18:23,20
-为什么？ -我要去查清楚
-Why? -That's what I'm gonna find out.

1257
01:18:44,43 --> 01:18:46,01
-喂？ -飞机准备好了
-Yeah. -Your plane is ready.

1258
01:18:46,10 --> 01:18:47,22
是吗？
Is that a fact?

1259
01:18:47,31 --> 01:18:49,81
对，不过你要先为我做一件事
That's a fact, but I'm gonna need something from you first.

1260
01:18:49,89 --> 01:18:52,94
我要亲眼看到人质平安无事
I'm gonna need to come in there and make sure the hostages are okay.

1261
01:18:53,02 --> 01:18:54,73
你会在巴士上看到他们
You'll see them when they get on the bus.

1262
01:18:54,82 --> 01:18:58,24
我要确定你没留下任何人
I just need to make sure you're not leaving any bodies behind.

1263
01:19:00,74 --> 01:19:02,45
到前门找我
Meet me at the front door.

1264
01:19:08,54 --> 01:19:11,75
-怎么回事？ -你疯了才会进去
-What the hell just happened? -You got to be crazy to go in there.

1265
01:20:01,84 --> 01:20:03,43
楼下
Down the stairs.

1266
01:20:11,52 --> 01:20:13,56
-口香糖？ -什么？
-Gum? -Excuse me?

1267
01:20:13,64 --> 01:20:16,65
-你要吃口香糖吗？ -不要，谢了
-Would you like some gum? -No, thank you.

1268
01:21:06,03 --> 01:21:07,99
让我把小孩带走
Let me take the kid.

1269
01:21:09,24 --> 01:21:10,78
不行
No.

1270
01:21:11,24 --> 01:21:12,91
还有吗？
Any more?

1271
01:21:13,08 --> 01:21:15,21
有些人不乖乖听话
There are some who misbehaved.

1272
01:21:21,25 --> 01:21:22,88
救我！
Please help me!

1273
01:21:23,76 --> 01:21:25,17
救我们！
Please help us!

1274
01:21:25,26 --> 01:21:27,72
请你救救我们！
Please help us! Please!

1275
01:21:28,39 --> 01:21:30,51
我们一定会救你们出去
We're gonna get you all out of here.

1276
01:21:30,60 --> 01:21:32,35
我保证
I promise you.

1277
01:21:33,10 --> 01:21:34,81
参观结束
Tour is over.

1278
01:21:42,82 --> 01:21:46,24
-我问你一个问题 -没什么好谈的
-Can I ask you a question? -There is nothing to talk about.

1279
01:21:46,86 --> 01:21:48,57
我真的弄到飞机
What were you planning on doing

1280
01:21:48,61 --> 01:21:51,20
你会怎样？
if you actually got the plane and the pilots, huh?

1281
01:21:51,78 --> 01:21:54,58
-什么？ -你从头到尾都不要飞机
-Excuse me? -You don't want a plane. You never did.

1282
01:21:54,62 --> 01:21:57,96
谁听过银行抢匪带人质逃逸？
Who ever heard of bank robbers escaping on a plane with 50 hostages?

1283
01:21:58,00 --> 01:22:01,42
你也看过《热天午后》，你一直在拖延时间
You saw Dog Day Afternoon. You're stalling. Why? I don't know.

1284
01:22:02,29 --> 01:22:04,80
我不知道为什么，怎么？打不开保险库？
What's the matter? You can't get into the safe?

1285
01:22:04,84 --> 01:22:06,47
也许吧
Perhaps.

1286
01:22:07,34 --> 01:22:08,80
你只有两个选择
There's two ways out of this.

1287
01:22:08,84 --> 01:22:12,81
跟我一起走出这道门或是让霹雳小组进行攻坚
The easy way, we walk out the front door together, or the hard boys cut the power,

1288
01:22:12,85 --> 01:22:15,72
丢催泪弹，闯进来火拼一场
hit you with the tear gas, and come in strong through the glass.

1289
01:22:15,81 --> 01:22:18,77
你我都不希望有这种结果
It's your choice. You don't want that. I don't want that.

1290
01:22:18,81 --> 01:22:21,06
他们今晚就想行动
And, you know, they'd like to do it tonight.

1291
01:22:21,15 --> 01:22:23,02
你们有夜视镜
You got night vision?

1292
01:22:23,48 --> 01:22:26,11
-和防毒面罩吗？ -也许有
-You got gas masks? -Maybe.

1293
01:22:27,32 --> 01:22:29,86
-我就快要下令攻坚了 -废话少说
-I'm this close to ordering it. -Let's cut the crap.

1294
01:22:29,95 --> 01:22:32,95
没有死伤或威胁
First, you don't order an assault when no hostages have been killed

1295
01:22:32,99 --> 01:22:34,54
不能下令攻坚
and there's no immediate threat.

1296
01:22:34,62 --> 01:22:37,66
如果真的要火拼一场
Second, if it ends that way, whatever happens,

1297
01:22:37,75 --> 01:22:39,46
你的麻烦就大了
you don't get to be the hero.

1298
01:22:39,50 --> 01:22:41,71
你想唬我，想都别想
You want to bullshit me, try harder.

1299
01:22:42,50 --> 01:22:44,04
走吧
Let's go.

1300
01:22:45,59 --> 01:22:47,09
好
Okay.

1301
01:22:54,26 --> 01:22:57,22
告诉你，我不会有麻烦
I tell you what. My ass is covered, sport.

1302
01:22:57,31 --> 01:22:59,94
你也别想在这儿舒服地享福
But I would not get too comfortable in here if I were you.

1303
01:23:00,02 --> 01:23:02,65
才怪，礼拜三要装第四台了
No? I got the cable guy coming on Wednesday.

1304
01:23:03,31 --> 01:23:05,98
-你何不走出大门？ -我会的
-Why don't you just walk out the door? -I will.

1305
01:23:07,78 --> 01:23:10,90
我准备好就会大摇大摆走出去
I'm gonna walk out of that door when I'm good and ready.

1306
01:23:11,20 --> 01:23:13,20
今天行不行？
Can I get you to do that today?

1307
01:23:14,99 --> 01:23:16,33
不行
I didn't think so.

1308
01:23:16,37 --> 01:23:17,70
你有其它要求吗？
Any other proposals?

1309
01:23:17,75 --> 01:23:20,00
别说“求”这个字
Oh, please. Do not say "proposals."

1310
01:23:20,04 --> 01:23:22,83
我女友要我跟她求婚
My girlfriend, she wants a proposal from me.

1311
01:23:22,88 --> 01:23:26,59
-你觉得太年轻不想安定下来？ -不是太年轻，是太穷了
-You think you're too young to get married? -No, I'm not too young. Too broke.

1312
01:23:26,67 --> 01:23:28,88
也许我也该抢银行
Maybe I should rob a bank.

1313
01:23:29,97 --> 01:23:31,93
你们真心相爱吗？
You love each other?

1314
01:23:32,22 --> 01:23:34,01
当然了
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1315
01:23:34,18 --> 01:23:36,35
那钱就不是问题
Then money shouldn't really matter.

1316
01:23:36,89 --> 01:23:38,89
多谢开导，银行抢匪
Thank you, bank robber.

1317
01:23:38,93 --> 01:23:42,19
我只是说金钱买不到真爱
I'm just saying money can't buy love.

1318
01:23:43,94 --> 01:23:46,61
我真心地谢谢你
Thank you very much. I'm ...

1319
01:23:48,03 --> 01:23:50,28
我今天学到好多
I'm learning so much today, you know?

1320
01:23:51,03 --> 01:23:53,86
咱们不如一起去对街的酒吧
Look, why don't we go across the street to the Killarney Rose, huh?

1321
01:23:53,91 --> 01:23:55,78
忘了这件事
Forget about this dangerous hostage situation.

1322
01:23:55,87 --> 01:23:58,37
-我请你喝酒 -谢了，警探
-I'll buy you a beer. My treat. -Thanks, Detective,

1323
01:23:58,45 --> 01:24:01,58
我还不想坐牢
but I'm trying to stay away from bars, if you know what I mean.

1324
01:24:01,66 --> 01:24:05,17
你再好好考虑一下
Well, if you change your mind there's still a standing offer, all right?

1325
01:24:10,92 --> 01:24:13,13
你想被关进监牢
Cellblock or the graveyard?

1326
01:24:13,22 --> 01:24:15,01
还是埋在坟墓？
Prison whites or a toe tag?

1327
01:24:15,09 --> 01:24:18,56
-最好赶快决定，分秒必争 -嘿！
-Make up your mind. Tick tock, tick tock. -Hey! Hey!

1328
01:24:19,47 --> 01:24:21,39
你闹够了吗？
We done?

1329
01:24:23,52 --> 01:24:25,65
你做得太过份了
You just crossed the fucking line!

1330
01:24:27,44 --> 01:24:29,61
巴士，停在外面
Buses, Kojak, parked outside.

1331
01:24:30,15 --> 01:24:32,32
你以为我在虚张声势？
You think I'm bluffing?

1332
01:24:32,95 --> 01:24:35,32
你就等着瞧吧
You roll the dice and see what happens.

1333
01:24:44,29 --> 01:24:46,29
举起盾牌
All right. Now get the bunker up.

1334
01:24:46,38 --> 01:24:48,42
-怎么样？ -我让他完全掌控大局
-So, what's up? -Got him right where I want him.

1335
01:24:48,46 --> 01:24:49,63
怎么说？
Yeah? Where's that?

1336
01:24:49,71 --> 01:24:53,17
我让他把我吃得死死的
Right behind me with my pants around my ankles, but it's a start.

1337
01:24:53,26 --> 01:24:54,80
天啊
Jesus Christ.

1338
01:25:09,31 --> 01:25:10,77
-搞什么？ -还要多久？
-What the fuck, man? -How long?

1339
01:25:10,86 --> 01:25:12,15
-他把你撂倒了 -两小时
-He got the drop on you! -Two.

1340
01:25:12,23 --> 01:25:13,78
-多久？ -他看到你的脸怎么办？
-How long? -What if he saw your face?

1341
01:25:13,86 --> 01:25:15,40
-两小时 -如果我当时没枪怎么办？
-Two. -What if I didn't have my gun?

1342
01:25:15,49 --> 01:25:17,07
两、三小时
Two, maybe three hours.

1343
01:25:17,16 --> 01:25:20,45
你让那警察太接近了
You know, you're letting this cop get too fucking close.

1344
01:25:23,41 --> 01:25:24,62
怎么回事？
What happened?

1345
01:25:24,66 --> 01:25:26,67
我给他很多藉口把我一枪轰掉
I gave him every excuse to blow my brains out.

1346
01:25:26,75 --> 01:25:27,75
对
Yeah.

1347
01:25:27,83 --> 01:25:30,96
他却没下手，为什么？他不会杀人
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

1348
01:25:31,05 --> 01:25:33,55
让我们好好想想这一点
Let's just step back and think about this for a second.

1349
01:25:33,63 --> 01:25:37,13
他一切都计划周详，录音带、摄影机、工作服
We know that they planned this whole thing. The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1350
01:25:37,22 --> 01:25:39,55
计划并不包括飞机
There was a game plan, but it never included airplanes.

1351
01:25:39,64 --> 01:25:42,31
他另有目的，但是不会伤人
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

1352
01:25:46,31 --> 01:25:48,85
-我在听 -收讯品质如何？
-I'm listening. -How's the reception?

1353
01:25:49,27 --> 01:25:51,69
-什么？ -车上的摄影机
-Excuse me? -The camera on the truck.

1354
01:25:52,11 --> 01:25:54,74
给二楼窗口来个特写镜头
Give me a close-up on the second-floor window.

1355
01:25:55,44 --> 01:25:57,36
-小骆？ -马上好
-Rourke? -I'm on it, I'm on it.

1356
01:26:08,92 --> 01:26:11,42
不要！
No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1357
01:26:11,50 --> 01:26:13,05
我靠
Oh, shit.

1358
01:26:16,42 --> 01:26:19,22
基斯！
Keith! Keith! Keith!

1359
01:26:25,56 --> 01:26:27,89
你在干什么？
What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing?

1360
01:26:27,98 --> 01:26:30,06
这不是很明显吗？
You mean beyond the obvious?

1361
01:26:30,23 --> 01:26:32,73
你并不是在抢银行
That's what I mean. Come on, this ain't no bank robbery!

1362
01:26:32,77 --> 01:26:35,69
这是你的错，我叫你准备巴士
This is your fault. I told you to get the buses.

1363
01:26:35,73 --> 01:26:39,20
去你的，我没有杀任何人
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1364
01:26:41,28 --> 01:26:43,99
我还有五十个人质，你敢再惹我
I got 50 more people in here. You fuck with me again,

1365
01:26:44,08 --> 01:26:46,20
这两天会很漫长
I'll give you two of the longest days of your life.

1366
01:26:46,29 --> 01:26:50,58
告诉我你到底要什么，我一定替你办到
All right, look, just tell me what it is you really want and I'll get it for you.

1367
01:26:50,67 --> 01:26:53,50
-我保证 -我说过，两辆巴士、一架飞机
-I promise. -I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

1368
01:26:53,59 --> 01:26:56,30
还有洋基球场的贵宾包厢票
Right, right. And box seats behind home plate at Yankee Stadium.

1369
01:26:56,38 --> 01:26:58,63
别再唬弄我
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

1370
01:26:59,30 --> 01:27:01,76
你的计划周详
You planned every inch of this thing right from the start.

1371
01:27:01,80 --> 01:27:05,60
我们都被你牵着鼻子走，不过我不随你起舞了
You got everybody marching to your beat, including me, and I'm through buying it.

1372
01:27:08,77 --> 01:27:10,98
你太聪明，不该当警察
You're too damn smart to be a cop.

1373
01:27:11,06 --> 01:27:12,81
给我滚出去
Now get the fuck out of here.

1374
01:27:12,90 --> 01:27:14,77
你要杀我吗？
What? You going to shoot me?

1375
01:27:15,44 --> 01:27:16,98
下手呀，你都杀了人了
Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

1376
01:27:17,07 --> 01:27:19,36
没什么好损失的，开枪呀
I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose, so shoot me.

1377
01:27:19,78 --> 01:27:21,24
下手呀
Do it.

1378
01:27:21,28 --> 01:27:23,32
-杀了我 -去你的
-Shoot me. -Fuck you.

1379
01:27:24,03 --> 01:27:26,54
叫他们派个正常人来
Tell them to send someone sane over here.

1380
01:27:55,48 --> 01:27:56,94
出了大问题
We got a big problem.

1381
01:27:57,02 --> 01:27:59,11
今天你衰毙了
Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

1382
01:28:05,91 --> 01:28:07,66
你好，队长
How you doing, Captain?

1383
01:28:09,45 --> 01:28:11,50
我知道你信任我
Look, I know you put your trust in me and I just...

1384
01:28:11,58 --> 01:28:14,37
你是个好警察
Well, you're a good cop. Frazier, I need more like you.

1385
01:28:14,46 --> 01:28:16,79
不过这次我不能被你拖下水
But if you're going down on this one, I can't go with you.

1386
01:28:16,84 --> 01:28:18,46
你要明白…
You got to understand this, though, sir...

1387
01:28:18,50 --> 01:28:20,71
我的问题是
No, no, no. Let me just tell you what my problem is, okay?

1388
01:28:20,80 --> 01:28:22,76
我上床睡觉，一切OK
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

1389
01:28:22,84 --> 01:28:25,22
到了半夜就死了一个人质
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what? A dead hostage.

1390
01:28:25,30 --> 01:28:28,10
-对，不过我能阻止他… -事情结束了
-Right, right, right. But I can end this... -It is ended.

1391
01:28:28,51 --> 01:28:30,47
我也别无选择
See, you think I got options.

1392
01:28:30,52 --> 01:28:32,81
这是上头的命令
I got to answer to the Chief of D's .

1393
01:28:32,89 --> 01:28:35,35
戴队长负责指挥攻坚行动
Darius is calling the shots on this. That's it.

1394
01:28:52,45 --> 01:28:54,25
嘿，警官
Hey, Sarge.

1395
01:28:54,54 --> 01:28:56,67
-他怎么说？ -就这样
-What'd he say? -That's it.

1396
01:28:57,92 --> 01:28:59,50
可恶
Shit.

1397
01:29:00,59 --> 01:29:03,22
-这是一场恶梦 -我知道
-It's a tactical nightmare. -I know.

1398
01:29:03,30 --> 01:29:06,34
这是唯一的入口
Well, first, this is the only way in.

1399
01:29:06,43 --> 01:29:08,68
然后要摸黑到楼上
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

1400
01:29:08,76 --> 01:29:11,06
一上去立刻成为标靶
Once we get up there, we're right out in the open.

1401
01:29:11,14 --> 01:29:15,14
对方有掩护，可以一一把我们打挂
They have the advantage of cover. They can pick us off like sitting ducks.

1402
01:29:15,73 --> 01:29:19,31
到了楼下也一样
Then if we make it across the floor and down the stairs,

1403
01:29:19,40 --> 01:29:22,82
也分不出谁是坏人谁是好人
we still can't tell the homies from the good guys until they shoot at us.

1404
01:29:22,90 --> 01:29:25,99
就算没有炸弹，也是恶梦一场
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives, it's still a fucking nightmare.

1405
01:29:31,41 --> 01:29:33,08
上，上
Move! Move! Move!

1406
01:29:33,91 --> 01:29:35,62
开门
Open the door!

1407
01:29:49,34 --> 01:29:51,47
-继续前进 -往右
-Keep moving. -To the right.

1408
01:29:51,56 --> 01:29:53,06
注意情况
Watch the hands, watch the hands.

1409
01:29:53,10 --> 01:29:55,60
人质一定会死伤惨重
And let's not forget the possibility of hostages being killed.

1410
01:29:55,64 --> 01:29:57,48
把枪放下！
Right now! Put the gun down!

1411
01:29:57,56 --> 01:30:00,40
退后！不然我就开枪
Back off or I shoot! I said back off!

1412
01:30:00,44 --> 01:30:03,82
唯一的机会是让抢匪落单
Well, our best hope is to separate them from the hostages.

1413
01:30:03,90 --> 01:30:06,65
在楼上把他们除掉
If we can get two or three upstairs and take them out?

1414
01:30:06,74 --> 01:30:08,49
射死他们？
Kill them?

1415
01:30:16,12 --> 01:30:17,87
对方有枪！
Gun! Gun! Gun!

1416
01:30:27,01 --> 01:30:28,47
对方不只四个怎么办？
What if there's more than four?

1417
01:30:28,55 --> 01:30:33,26
穿工作服的人都可能是嫌犯
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it. Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

1418
01:30:33,43 --> 01:30:36,68
也许我们也该穿工作服
Maybe we should dress our guys up like a bunch of painters.

1419
01:30:37,56 --> 01:30:41,48
用橡胶子弹，瞄准头部，把他们打昏
And we should use rubber bullets. Take head shots. Put their lights out.

1420
01:30:43,32 --> 01:30:45,03
-好主意 -对
-Not a bad idea. -Yeah.

1421
01:30:45,11 --> 01:30:47,11
那就用橡胶子弹吧
Rubber bullets it is, baby.

1422
01:30:51,66 --> 01:30:53,66
这件事最后死伤惨重
If this goes down wrong,

1423
01:30:54,41 --> 01:30:57,62
责任都会推到你身上
they're going to dump this whole mess in your lap, you know?

1424
01:30:57,70 --> 01:30:59,50
-我要升任高级警探 -什么？
-I'm making First Grade. -What?

1425
01:30:59,58 --> 01:31:02,88
我要升任高级警探，眼见不能为凭
I'm making Detective First Grade. Things ain't all they appear to be.

1426
01:31:02,96 --> 01:31:07,01
-什么意思？ -高级警探费基斯
-What the fuck does that mean? -Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

1427
01:31:07,09 --> 01:31:09,22
-你在开玩笑吧？ -对
-Are you fucking kidding me? -Yes.

1428
01:31:09,30 --> 01:31:11,97
多谢市长和神秘贵宾
Thank the Mayor and our mystery guest for that.

1429
01:31:12,72 --> 01:31:14,72
你和他们谈条件？
You cut a deal with those guys?

1430
01:31:15,14 --> 01:31:17,39
我一定会升任高级警探
Never make First Grade? Shit.

1431
01:31:18,27 --> 01:31:20,14
我太努力了
Worked too hard to let that happen.

1432
01:31:20,19 --> 01:31:22,90
大家都升官，我也要升官
Everybody's getting theirs. I'm gonna get mine.

1433
01:31:24,82 --> 01:31:26,57
我会在外面
I'll be outside.

1434
01:31:32,20 --> 01:31:33,78
太扯了，太扯了
What a day, what a day.

1435
01:31:33,87 --> 01:31:37,62
攻坚行动你不参一脚？这不公平
Detective, they're gonna storm that bank without you? It's not right.

1436
01:31:38,70 --> 01:31:42,12
谈谈12岁小子拿枪指住你
So, tell me about the kid who pointed the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

1437
01:31:42,21 --> 01:31:44,08
-现在？ -对
-Now? -Yeah.

1438
01:31:44,54 --> 01:31:46,30
去年在33管区
Last year, up in the 33rd,

1439
01:31:46,38 --> 01:31:49,21
我到一所高中附近劝阻一场打架
I was breaking up a fight about a half a block from the high school.

1440
01:31:49,26 --> 01:31:52,01
小西班牙佬被扁得倒在地上
This one little spic is getting his clock cleaned by another one.

1441
01:31:52,05 --> 01:31:55,43
拜托，别用种族歧视字眼
Do me a favor, Sergeant. Just tone down the color commentary.

1442
01:31:57,39 --> 01:31:59,68
我把他们拆散
So I bust up the fight,

1443
01:31:59,73 --> 01:32:03,44
一转头这小子就拿枪指住我
I turn around and this kid is pointing a .22 at my chest.

1444
01:32:03,52 --> 01:32:07,57
-那小子是什么人？ -一个非裔美国人
-Is that right? Now, which kid was this? -Another kid, an African-American.

1445
01:32:07,65 --> 01:32:09,19
-非裔美国人 -对
-An African-American, right? -Yeah.

1446
01:32:09,28 --> 01:32:10,86
他突然冒出来
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

1447
01:32:10,90 --> 01:32:12,03
后来怎样？
So, what'd you do?

1448
01:32:12,11 --> 01:32:14,28
我告诉你
What did I do then? I'll tell you what I did then.

1449
01:32:14,36 --> 01:32:17,49
我胸口中了一枪
I got shot in the fucking chest. That's what I did then.

1450
01:32:17,70 --> 01:32:20,00
恕我直言哦，警探
Yeah, so you'll pardon my euphemisms, Detective,

1451
01:32:20,08 --> 01:32:23,67
我宁愿种族歧视也不想死
but I would rather wind up an old bigot than a handsome young corpse.

1452
01:32:23,75 --> 01:32:25,38
我没别的意思
Now, no offense, Detective,

1453
01:32:25,42 --> 01:32:27,92
我只是不想让警察被坏人杀死
but I'm just trying to keep them away from us.

1454
01:32:27,96 --> 01:32:31,22
咱们把人质安全救出来吧
Now, what do you say we just get these people safely out of the bank?

1455
01:32:31,26 --> 01:32:32,38
说的好
I hear that.

1456
01:32:32,47 --> 01:32:35,59
我下次说话会小心点
And I'll try and watch what I say in the future.

1457
01:32:35,68 --> 01:32:37,72
谁晓得谁会在听
You never know who's listening.

1458
01:32:52,11 --> 01:32:53,65
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1459
01:32:53,74 --> 01:32:55,28
可恶
Jesus. Shit.

1460
01:32:55,61 --> 01:32:57,57
他们在窃听我们
They bugged us.

1461
01:32:57,74 --> 01:32:59,70
他们在窃听我们
They bugged us.

1462
01:33:02,87 --> 01:33:04,50
戴队长
Darius!

1463
01:33:04,67 --> 01:33:06,63
戴队长，停止行动！
Darius, don't make a move!

1464
01:33:06,71 --> 01:33:08,54
-什么？ -这是圈套
-What? -It's all fucked up!

1465
01:33:08,63 --> 01:33:10,59
不能攻坚，把你的手下叫回来
Do not make a move! Keep your men back!

1466
01:33:10,67 --> 01:33:12,13
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1467
01:33:12,17 --> 01:33:13,84
我们说什么他们都听到
They heard everything we said in the M.C.C.

1468
01:33:13,92 --> 01:33:16,01
-什么？ -撤退！撤退！
-What? -Stand down! Stand down!

1469
01:33:16,09 --> 01:33:19,47
对方送来的告示板里面装了窃听器
The drawer with the demands in it! They heard everything we said!

1470
01:33:19,51 --> 01:33:21,85
我们说什么都被他们听见
They put a transmitter in it! They bugged us!

1471
01:33:21,93 --> 01:33:23,93
不行，我们要攻进去
No, no, no. I'm going in.

1472
01:33:25,48 --> 01:33:27,02
该死
Shit.

1473
01:33:34,70 --> 01:33:36,24
把大家找来
Get everyone together.

1474
01:33:36,32 --> 01:33:38,74
史蒂夫！史蒂佛！
Steve! Steve-O!

1475
01:33:41,70 --> 01:33:43,25
他们要攻进来
They're coming in.

1476
01:33:43,33 --> 01:33:45,12
-准备好了吗？ -好了
-Everybody good? -Yeah.

1477
01:33:45,16 --> 01:33:47,21
好了，大家出去
All right! Everybody out!

1478
01:33:47,29 --> 01:33:50,13
-把面罩戴上 -大家出去！出去！
-Put your masks on! -Everyone out! Out!

1479
01:33:51,42 --> 01:33:52,50
-去 -去
-Go now! -Go!

1480
01:33:52,59 --> 01:33:54,92
出去！
Go! Go! Go!

1481
01:33:56,18 --> 01:33:58,18
-现在 -快给我出去
-Now! -Get the fuck out!

1482
01:33:58,22 --> 01:33:59,34
快点！
Move!

1483
01:33:59,43 --> 01:34:02,56
大家上楼梯，快点！
Everybody up the fucking stairs! Move!

1484
01:34:12,57 --> 01:34:14,15
上吧
Move!

1485
01:34:42,05 --> 01:34:43,68
-别开枪！ -别开枪！
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot! -Don't shoot!

1486
01:34:43,76 --> 01:34:46,14
-趴下来 -别开枪！
-Get down! Get down on the ground! -Don't shoot!

1487
01:34:50,85 --> 01:34:52,48
停火！
Cease fire!

1488
01:34:52,77 --> 01:34:54,69
停火！停火！
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1489
01:34:55,94 --> 01:34:58,03
停火！停火！
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1490
01:35:00,82 --> 01:35:02,37
走吧
Let's go, people.

1491
01:35:19,05 --> 01:35:20,88
趴下来，手放头上！
Put your hands on your head! Get down!

1492
01:35:20,93 --> 01:35:22,26
手放头上
Put your hands on your head.

1493
01:35:22,34 --> 01:35:24,47
-谁能阻止他？ -趴下来！
-Will somebody stop him? -Get down!

1494
01:35:24,56 --> 01:35:26,31
手放头上
Put your hands on your head.

1495
01:35:26,39 --> 01:35:28,39
-手放头上 -趴下来
-Put your hands on your head. -Get them down!

1496
01:35:28,48 --> 01:35:31,40
-趴在地上！ -手放头上！
-On the ground! -Put your hands on your fucking heads!

1497
01:35:31,44 --> 01:35:32,98
别动！
Do not move!

1498
01:35:33,06 --> 01:35:36,19
-趴下来，手放头上！ -帮他们戴上手铐！走吧！
-Get down, put your hands on your head! -Put the cuffs on them! Let's go!

1499
01:35:40,07 --> 01:35:41,74
搞什么？
What's going on?

1500
01:35:47,37 --> 01:35:49,08
别想逃！
Don't take any chances!

1501
01:35:51,46 --> 01:35:54,08
不是我，我不是坏人
It wasn't me! I'm not a criminal!

1502
01:35:55,04 --> 01:35:56,67
手铐！
Cuffs!

1503
01:35:58,92 --> 01:36:00,05
别开枪！
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1504
01:36:00,13 --> 01:36:02,26
-别动！ -我没在动！
-Don't move! -I'm not moving!

1505
01:36:08,64 --> 01:36:10,77
-别动！ -别动！
-Don't move! -Do not move!

1506
01:36:10,85 --> 01:36:13,77
好好检查，确定他们身上没有武器
Check them. Make sure they ain't got no weapons on them and shit.

1507
01:36:13,81 --> 01:36:15,81
-小何 -我在这儿
-Hernandez! -Right here.

1508
01:36:18,07 --> 01:36:20,11
霹雳小组，集合
E.S.U. team, line up!

1509
01:36:31,16 --> 01:36:33,08
左边，左边
Door to the left, door to the left.

1510
01:36:33,17 --> 01:36:35,46
-右边安全 -安全
-Clear on the right. -Clear!

1511
01:36:38,00 --> 01:36:39,96
-左边安全 -安全
-Left side clear. -Clear!

1512
01:36:42,01 --> 01:36:44,22
-安全 -安全
-Clear. -Clear.

1513
01:36:44,30 --> 01:36:46,68
-一切安全 -检查桌底
-All clear! -Check under the desk.

1514
01:36:47,39 --> 01:36:50,14
-安全 -检查办公室，一切安全
-Clear. -Checking the office. All clear, Sarge.

1515
01:36:51,35 --> 01:36:52,94
-安全 -安全
-Clear. -Clear.

1516
01:36:53,02 --> 01:36:54,56
安全
Clear.

1517
01:36:55,19 --> 01:36:56,23
安全
Clear.

1518
01:36:56,31 --> 01:36:57,98
一切安全
All clear, Sarge.

1519
01:37:01,40 --> 01:37:03,99
安全，大家集合
All clear. E.S.U. on the stairs. Line it up!

1520
01:37:11,75 --> 01:37:14,29
去吧，快去！
Let's go, guys. Team in, team in. Let's go.

1521
01:37:19,75 --> 01:37:21,30
安全
Clear!

1522
01:37:21,38 --> 01:37:23,26
-安全 -安全
-Clear. -Clear.

1523
01:37:25,05 --> 01:37:26,97
-安全 -安全
-Clear. -Clear.

1524
01:37:27,05 --> 01:37:28,60
安全
Clear.

1525
01:37:28,76 --> 01:37:30,68
-安全 -安全
-Clear, Sarge. -Clear.

1526
01:37:31,35 --> 01:37:33,85
盾牌，我要盾牌
Give me a bunker up here. I need a bunker up front.

1527
01:37:33,93 --> 01:37:35,69
把盾牌拿来
Bringing the bunker up.

1528
01:37:35,73 --> 01:37:37,31
安全
Clear, Sarge.

1529
01:37:38,40 --> 01:37:39,98
安全
Clear.

1530
01:37:40,27 --> 01:37:43,03
-正在清除现场 -确定没有嫌犯
-We're almost clear down here. -Make sure you're sure.

1531
01:37:43,36 --> 01:37:45,03
-我正在搜查 -继续搜
-I'll keep looking. -Stay on it.

1532
01:37:45,07 --> 01:37:46,66
收到
Roger that.

1533
01:37:47,20 --> 01:37:49,20
好了吗？走吧
Ready? Let's go.

1534
01:37:52,87 --> 01:37:54,62
最后一道门
This is the last door.

1535
01:38:01,80 --> 01:38:04,26
-安全 -下来吧
-Clear, Sarge! -Come on down.

1536
01:38:11,72 --> 01:38:13,27
-找到死人质吗？ -没有
-Did you find a dead hostage? -Negative.

1537
01:38:13,35 --> 01:38:15,27
一定有哪里没搜到
If it ain't here, you must've missed something.

1538
01:38:15,35 --> 01:38:18,19
不过我确定这里只有我们
Maybe, but I'm pretty sure we're the only ones moving around down here.

1539
01:38:18,27 --> 01:38:21,07
你看，他们忘了抢钱了
Check this out. They forgot to rob the joint.

1540
01:38:21,15 --> 01:38:23,65
-我靠 -找不到抢匪？
-Holy shit. -And you didn't find anybody?

1541
01:38:23,73 --> 01:38:25,94
我们还在找，不过没有坏人
We're still looking, but there are no bad guys,

1542
01:38:26,03 --> 01:38:28,20
没有炸弹、没有隧道、没有破坏
no booby traps, no tunnels, no damage.

1543
01:38:28,28 --> 01:38:29,70
-也没有抢劫 -棒呆了
-And nothing missing. -Great, great, great.

1544
01:38:29,78 --> 01:38:32,66
我们干脆通缉大卫魔术师吧
We'll put out a city-wide description for David fucking Copperfield, then, huh?

1545
01:38:32,74 --> 01:38:34,75
我想你们也应该清楚
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you your jobs, Detectives,

1546
01:38:34,83 --> 01:38:36,87
除非抢匪能飞天遁地
but unless they swam out through the toilets,

1547
01:38:36,96 --> 01:38:38,75
不然他们就在人质之中
whoever did this is upstairs sucking pavement.

1548
01:38:38,83 --> 01:38:40,13
很好
All right, good job.

1549
01:38:40,21 --> 01:38:41,96
这是什么？
What's that?

1550
01:38:44,13 --> 01:38:45,67
手机
Cell phones.

1551
01:38:46,38 --> 01:38:49,30
-大伙儿，过来看 -好
-Hey, guys! You need to see this. -Okay.

1552
01:38:49,64 --> 01:38:53,60
柯巡警，找巡警点算钞票
Collins! Grab a uniform, make a quick count of that money in there, all right?

1553
01:38:53,68 --> 01:38:55,56
-是 -你在旁监督
-Yes, sir. -And stand by, all right?

1554
01:38:55,64 --> 01:38:57,52
别偷钱，包括你在内
Don't let anybody get tempted, including you!

1555
01:38:57,60 --> 01:38:59,19
是，长官
Yes, sir!

1556
01:38:59,27 --> 01:39:00,85
这里
Right here, Detective.

1557
01:39:00,94 --> 01:39:04,53
-找到什么？ -你一定会喜欢，玩具枪
-What do you got? -You're going to love this one. Toy guns.

1558
01:39:04,61 --> 01:39:06,78
开什么玩笑
Fake guns. You got to be kidding me.

1559
01:39:07,82 --> 01:39:10,57
-玩具枪 -越来越诡异了
-Toys. -As if it wasn't weird enough already.

1560
01:39:10,66 --> 01:39:12,83
队长，请到女厕
Cap, come to the ladies' room.

1561
01:39:13,41 --> 01:39:15,04
马上来
On my way.

1562
01:39:32,72 --> 01:39:34,35
你们看
Check it out.

1563
01:39:35,06 --> 01:39:37,14
不必找尸体了
We can stop looking for that body.

1564
01:39:37,68 --> 01:39:39,23
假枪
Fake guns.

1565
01:39:39,94 --> 01:39:41,65
假装杀人
Fake execution.

1566
01:39:42,65 --> 01:39:44,82
仔细盘问每个人质
Nobody goes home till we get everybody's story.

1567
01:39:44,86 --> 01:39:47,57
储藏室有东西
Cap, we got something else in the storage room.

1568
01:39:59,41 --> 01:40:01,33
-波卡？ -有
-Porcario? -Yo.

1569
01:40:01,67 --> 01:40:04,54
-男厕在哪里？ -走廊尽头左手边
-Where's the men's room? -Down the hallway on the left.

1570
01:40:15,14 --> 01:40:17,81
把他们带上车
Pick them up, pick them up. Toss them.

1571
01:40:17,89 --> 01:40:20,02
我是人质！别推我！
I'm a hostage. Stop pushing.

1572
01:40:43,50 --> 01:40:47,54
只有女警才能帮女人质搜身
Female hostages to be searched by female officers only!

1573
01:40:48,55 --> 01:40:50,71
把这些人带走
All right, listen, let's get these people up.

1574
01:40:50,80 --> 01:40:52,97
-我听不见，什么？ -薇洛莉齐普赛
-I can't hear you. What? -Valerie Keepsake.

1575
01:40:53,05 --> 01:40:54,97
上车
Valerie Keepsake. Go, go, get on the bus.

1576
01:40:55,05 --> 01:40:56,76
-肯尼德莫吉 -对
-Kenneth Damerjian. -Yeah.

1577
01:40:56,85 --> 01:40:58,18
第一个人
Person one.

1578
01:40:58,26 --> 01:41:00,93
-我是彼得・韩蒙 -艾瑞克・道奇
-I'm Peter Hammond. -Eric Dodge.

1579
01:41:01,02 --> 01:41:03,94
-等等 -凯姆，我叫凯姆
-Wait! -Chaim. My name's Chaim.

1580
01:41:05,73 --> 01:41:07,44
臭条子
Fucking cocksucker.

1581
01:41:08,11 --> 01:41:09,65
等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1582
01:41:09,73 --> 01:41:11,90
告诉我你的名字
Just give me your name. Just give me your name.

1583
01:41:11,94 --> 01:41:13,86
说出你的名字
Say your name.

1584
01:41:14,61 --> 01:41:16,57
我在银行上班
I work in the bank!

1585
01:41:16,78 --> 01:41:19,37
我是银行警卫，没有人在听我说话！
I'm the bank security guard! Nobody's listening!

1586
01:41:19,45 --> 01:41:20,74
我们会调查的
Okay, we'll straighten it out.

1587
01:41:20,79 --> 01:41:22,45
说要听结果没人听！
Everybody's saying listen! Nobody's listening!

1588
01:41:22,54 --> 01:41:23,96
我们会调查的，来吧
We'll straighten it out. Come on.

1589
01:41:24,00 --> 01:41:26,00
-我不要上车！ -不行
-Listen, I'm not getting on the bus! -Yes, you are.

1590
01:41:26,08 --> 01:41:28,46
-走！ -我在银行上班！
-Move! Move! Move! -I am not! I work at the bank!

1591
01:41:28,54 --> 01:41:30,05
你听到吗？
Collins, you got this?

1592
01:41:30,13 --> 01:41:31,55
我在银行上班
Listen, I work at the bank!

1593
01:41:31,63 --> 01:41:33,76
把他带上车
All right, just get him on the bus. Get him on the bus.

1594
01:41:33,80 --> 01:41:36,93
-没人听我说话！ -冷静一点，上车吧
-Nobody's listening! -All right. Calm down. Get on the bus.

1595
01:41:50,69 --> 01:41:52,86
-走吧 -这边
-Come on, guys, guys! -Over this way. Over this way.

1596
01:41:52,94 --> 01:41:54,99
把她带去给警官
Officer, take her over to Sarge. Come on.

1597
01:41:55,78 --> 01:41:59,12
走吧，去搞定在那边排队的人
Come on, let's get going with these people off that line over there.

1598
01:41:59,16 --> 01:42:00,74
快点
Come on.

1599
01:42:07,17 --> 01:42:10,79
整件事一片混乱
Captain, I'm telling you, this thing is a mess.

1600
01:42:11,67 --> 01:42:13,84
对方从头到尾都计划周详
They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

1601
01:42:13,92 --> 01:42:15,97
把事情给我交代清楚
So, lay it out for me.

1602
01:42:16,18 --> 01:42:18,72
我们拍下每个人质的照片
We photograph everybody that came out of the bank.

1603
01:42:18,80 --> 01:42:21,64
仔细盘问他们，把照片给他们看
We sit them down, we question them, we show them the photos.

1604
01:42:21,72 --> 01:42:25,14
多半都指认不出抢匪
Most of them can't point to anybody that's guilty of anything.

1605
01:42:25,98 --> 01:42:29,40
我们也问他们谁不是抢匪
We ask them if they could recognize anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1606
01:42:29,48 --> 01:42:32,15
就算其中有几个可能是嫌犯
Even if we considered someone as a possible suspect,

1607
01:42:32,23 --> 01:42:34,99
也有两、三人将他们排除在外
there's one or two or three other people that would rule them out.

1608
01:42:35,03 --> 01:42:36,45
好像这件事从没发生
It's like the thing never happened.

1609
01:42:36,53 --> 01:42:39,32
-指纹呢？ -到处都是，又怎样？
-What about prints? -Everywhere. So what?

1610
01:42:40,20 --> 01:42:43,70
-只能证明那里有很多人 -不在场证明？
-All it shows is that these people were there. -Alibis?

1611
01:42:43,79 --> 01:42:45,16
每个人都有
Just about everyone.

1612
01:42:45,20 --> 01:42:47,12
就算有可疑人士
Even if their alibi was weak,

1613
01:42:47,21 --> 01:42:50,25
人质也会证明他们是好人
a hostage would identify them as being one of the good guys.

1614
01:42:50,33 --> 01:42:51,88
一点进展也没有
There we are, back to square one.

1615
01:42:51,96 --> 01:42:53,00
前科犯？
Priors?

1616
01:42:53,05 --> 01:42:56,55
一名职员待过少年感化院
We got one employee who had some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1617
01:42:56,63 --> 01:42:58,18
抱歉
Excuse me.

1618
01:42:58,51 --> 01:43:01,18
一位客人没付孩子抚养金被别州通缉
One customer had an out-of-state warrant for child support.

1619
01:43:01,22 --> 01:43:03,97
另一个有窃盗前科
Another one had a couple of priors, G.L.A. mostly.

1620
01:43:05,02 --> 01:43:07,98
一样没证据，而且他是笨蛋
Again, same problem. Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1621
01:43:08,06 --> 01:43:10,06
-监视摄影机？ -没有用
-Bank cameras? -Useless.

1622
01:43:10,15 --> 01:43:12,56
他们几乎什么都想到了
I'm telling you, they thought of everything. Almost.

1623
01:43:12,65 --> 01:43:14,98
-应该是全都想到了吧 -除了这个
-Sounded like everything to me. -But this.

1624
01:43:15,07 --> 01:43:18,32
找不到手枪和持枪的抢匪
We haven't found that .357 or the perp that was holding it.

1625
01:43:18,40 --> 01:43:21,07
就算找到也采不到指纹
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

1626
01:43:21,91 --> 01:43:23,58
-就这样结案吧 -结案？
-Bury it. -Bury it?

1627
01:43:23,66 --> 01:43:25,95
你要我说什么？
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1628
01:43:30,00 --> 01:43:33,42
这起案子疑云重重
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell. I mean, somebody did something here.

1629
01:43:33,46 --> 01:43:35,05
你自己也说
You said it yourself.

1630
01:43:35,09 --> 01:43:37,72
没有抢案、没有嫌犯
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1631
01:43:38,26 --> 01:43:40,55
上头也没逼我破案
Nobody's breathing down my neck to come up with answers.

1632
01:43:40,63 --> 01:43:43,10
结案吧
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1633
01:43:46,72 --> 01:43:48,56
我没猜到会这样
I wasn't expecting this.

1634
01:43:48,60 --> 01:43:51,65
我保证会让你们办别的案子
I promise you, I'll find you guys more cases to solve.

1635
01:43:54,15 --> 01:43:55,65
好
Okay.

1636
01:43:57,03 --> 01:43:59,90
你大概早就猜到这件事
Oh, here's something that you probably did expect.

1637
01:43:59,95 --> 01:44:03,66
-他们找到遗失的支票 -真的假的？
-They found that missing Madrugada money. -No shit.

1638
01:44:04,28 --> 01:44:06,45
真的，你想知道在哪儿吗？
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1639
01:44:06,54 --> 01:44:08,75
-我的银行帐户？ -不是
-In my bank account? -No.

1640
01:44:08,79 --> 01:44:11,12
-我在山上的别墅？ -不是
-My summer house in Sag Harbor? -No.

1641
01:44:11,21 --> 01:44:13,38
-我的皮夹？ -也不是
-My wallet? -No.

1642
01:44:13,79 --> 01:44:16,55
那我就不想知道
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1643
01:44:24,34 --> 01:44:26,10
这太扯了
This is bullshit, man.

1644
01:44:26,14 --> 01:44:28,43
我们只想抓到坏人
I mean, we're the only ones left trying to catch the bad guys

1645
01:44:28,47 --> 01:44:30,14
他们却要整我们
and they're gonna come after us like that?

1646
01:44:30,23 --> 01:44:32,27
谁敢找你碴
I'll tell you what. Every one of your accusers, man,

1647
01:44:32,31 --> 01:44:35,77
咱们就报仇，像教父那样赶尽杀绝
I say we go after them all, Keith, Michael Corleone style.

1648
01:44:35,81 --> 01:44:37,86
“你唾弃撒旦吗？”
"Michael Corleone, do you renounce Satan?"

1649
01:44:37,94 --> 01:44:39,90
“我唾弃撒旦”
"Yes, I renounce him."

1650
01:44:40,74 --> 01:44:42,78
没有392号
There's no 392.

1651
01:44:42,82 --> 01:44:45,82
-什么？ -392号保险箱
-Huh? -Safety deposit box number 392.

1652
01:44:45,87 --> 01:44:48,12
根据记录它不存在
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

1653
01:44:48,20 --> 01:44:50,66
那个臭女人当面撒谎
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

1654
01:44:51,00 --> 01:44:54,17
-队长叫我们不要查下去 -走吧
-Didn't Coughlin say we should move on? -Let's go.

1655
01:45:03,59 --> 01:45:05,89
谢了，法官大人，我明天来拿
Thank you, again, Your Honor. I'll come pick it up tomorrow?

1656
01:45:05,97 --> 01:45:07,97
-没问题 -谢谢
-Yes, you're welcome. -Thank you.

1657
01:45:14,85 --> 01:45:16,36
你好
What are you doing, Detective?

1658
01:45:16,44 --> 01:45:18,98
你找巴法官有什么事？
Now, what business do you have with Judge Pasqua?

1659
01:45:19,07 --> 01:45:20,57
我在办案
Police business.

1660
01:45:20,65 --> 01:45:24,03
-你不是被要求结案吗？ -这案子我要办到底
-Weren't you told to bury this? -I got a job to do, Miss White.

1661
01:45:24,11 --> 01:45:26,95
曾几何时你的案子比你的饭碗重要
And since when is your job more important than your career?

1662
01:45:27,03 --> 01:45:29,45
-你忘了我们的协议吗？ -我们没有协议
-Or did you forget our arrangement? -We didn't have any arrangement.

1663
01:45:29,54 --> 01:45:30,95
让我告诉你
Let me tell you how this works. You...

1664
01:45:31,04 --> 01:45:33,04
不，让我告诉你
No, let me tell you how this works.

1665
01:45:33,12 --> 01:45:36,33
按这里录音，按这里播放
You press here to record and you press here to play.

1666
01:45:36,42 --> 01:45:40,00
你负责侦办的贩毒案
There's also the matter of the $140,000 that seems to have walked away

1667
01:45:40,09 --> 01:45:42,84
有一张14万支票不翼而飞
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

1668
01:45:43,05 --> 01:45:45,30
那件事与我无关
I didn't have anything to do with that, so...

1669
01:45:45,38 --> 01:45:47,43
我们愿意替你说好话
We'd like to be in your corner on that.

1670
01:45:47,51 --> 01:45:50,39
你们要我犯法吗？
In exchange for what? I mean, what, do you want me to do something unethical?

1671
01:45:50,43 --> 01:45:52,39
我不是瞧不起你们
I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse

1672
01:45:52,47 --> 01:45:54,52
但是我不需要市长帮忙
but I don't need you to be in my corner, Mr. Mayor.

1673
01:45:54,60 --> 01:45:55,94
我是无辜的
Look, I'm innocent.

1674
01:45:56,02 --> 01:45:58,81
不管怎样你都会被整得很惨
Innocent or guilty, you're still going down.

1675
01:45:59,65 --> 01:46:03,61
乖乖和魏小姐合作，不然就别想在警界混下去
Give Miss White whatever she needs, or your career is over.

1676
01:46:04,07 --> 01:46:05,53
你玩完了
Done.

1677
01:46:05,57 --> 01:46:07,20
全完了
Kaput.

1678
01:46:08,28 --> 01:46:11,24
你只要跟我合作
So? You gave me what I wanted.

1679
01:46:11,33 --> 01:46:14,46
就会飞黄腾达
Your career is blossoming and all is right with the world.

1680
01:46:14,54 --> 01:46:16,54
寇先生想隐瞒什么？
What was Case hiding?

1681
01:46:19,25 --> 01:46:22,71
罗士柴尔德男爵有句名言…
You know, there's a famous saying by the Baron de Rothschild.

1682
01:46:24,42 --> 01:46:27,63
“只要街头喋血，就开始投资”
"When there's blood on the streets, buy property."

1683
01:46:30,10 --> 01:46:33,14
寇先生对这点深信不疑
I think Mr. Case really took that sentiment to heart.

1684
01:46:33,22 --> 01:46:36,02
他和五百大企业老板没两样
But he is no different than half the Fortune 500.

1685
01:46:37,48 --> 01:46:39,23
罢手吧
Let it go, Detective.

1686
01:46:40,73 --> 01:46:42,48
你是好警察
You're a good cop.

1687
01:46:43,11 --> 01:46:44,82
人民需要你
This city needs you.

1688
01:47:13,01 --> 01:47:16,48
-小姐，这是男厕 -我约了人
-Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place. -I have an appointment.

1689
01:47:25,11 --> 01:47:26,65
亚瑟
Arthur.

1690
01:47:27,11 --> 01:47:29,66
-早安 -魏小姐
-Good morning. -Miss White.

1691
01:47:30,49 --> 01:47:32,03
请坐
Have a seat.

1692
01:47:33,70 --> 01:47:36,50
谢谢你，可以了
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now. Thank you.

1693
01:47:40,12 --> 01:47:42,29
他怎么说？
Well. What did he say?

1694
01:47:42,38 --> 01:47:45,42
费警探很聪明
Well, Detective Frazier turned out to be quite sharp.

1695
01:47:45,50 --> 01:47:48,63
我答应让他升官，把他搞定了
But I just fast-tracked his career a little and he's under control.

1696
01:47:48,72 --> 01:47:51,68
希望如此，那个信封
I hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1697
01:47:52,14 --> 01:47:53,30
它在哪里？
Where is it now?

1698
01:47:53,35 --> 01:47:56,27
它在抢匪首领手上
Well, the gang leader is going to hang on to it,

1699
01:47:56,35 --> 01:47:59,48
以免你向他报复
as an insurance policy to keep you from seeking revenge.

1700
01:48:00,14 --> 01:48:02,90
他抓住了你的把柄
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1701
01:48:02,98 --> 01:48:04,31
什么把柄？
And what might that be?

1702
01:48:04,36 --> 01:48:07,65
你在二次大战大屠杀期间
Well, let's see. In a nutshell, that you got rich,

1703
01:48:07,86 --> 01:48:10,99
和纳粹党做生意发大财
doing business with the Nazis during the Holocaust.

1704
01:48:14,24 --> 01:48:15,74
对
Yes.

1705
01:48:16,54 --> 01:48:19,66
那是六十年前的事，我很年轻，野心勃勃
It was 60 years ago. I was young and ambitious.

1706
01:48:20,29 --> 01:48:23,08
我走上成功的捷径
I saw a short path to success and I took it.

1707
01:48:24,71 --> 01:48:26,59
我出卖了灵魂
I sold my soul.

1708
01:48:28,01 --> 01:48:31,01
从此就一直想赎罪
And I've been trying to buy it back ever since.

1709
01:48:31,05 --> 01:48:35,55
你和对方达到共识吗？
But you and this mystery man, you have an understanding?

1710
01:48:35,72 --> 01:48:39,56
应该有，他把信封带出去
I think so. And he managed to get out of there with that envelope.

1711
01:48:40,60 --> 01:48:43,94
有一天他会勒索你
If someday he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1712
01:48:44,77 --> 01:48:47,48
你会付钱把信封拿回来
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1713
01:48:48,73 --> 01:48:50,82
-就这么简单 -我猜也是
-So, I guess that's it. -I suppose so.

1714
01:48:50,90 --> 01:48:52,78
-放屁 -你说什么？
-Bullshit. -I beg your pardon?

1715
01:48:52,86 --> 01:48:56,74
他大费周章不是为了你的信封
He didn't go through all that just to stick your envelope under his mattress.

1716
01:48:56,78 --> 01:48:59,62
他们一毛钱都没拿
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1717
01:48:59,70 --> 01:49:00,83
又怎样？
So?

1718
01:49:00,91 --> 01:49:05,29
他一定有拿走什么
So, he had to have walked out of there with something else.

1719
01:49:06,25 --> 01:49:08,75
银行说什么都没被拿走
The bank says that there was nothing missing.

1720
01:49:08,84 --> 01:49:11,42
你的保险箱
So, there had to have been something in that box

1721
01:49:11,51 --> 01:49:14,13
一定有更值钱的东西
that was worth more to him than your envelope.

1722
01:49:16,14 --> 01:49:18,14
你不必告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

1723
01:49:18,22 --> 01:49:20,60
不过只有一个可能
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1724
01:49:23,98 --> 01:49:25,56
钻石
Diamonds.

1725
01:49:26,11 --> 01:49:27,94
还有一只
And then there's the ring.

1726
01:49:28,65 --> 01:49:30,40
卡地亚钻戒
Cartier ring.

1727
01:49:30,69 --> 01:49:33,65
它属于一位巴黎银行家夫人
It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1728
01:49:34,07 --> 01:49:36,74
有钱的法国犹太家族
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1729
01:49:37,41 --> 01:49:40,54
战争爆发后，他们的财产被纳粹没收
And when the war came along, the ring and everything else they owned

1730
01:49:40,62 --> 01:49:45,42
全家被送到集中营，无一幸免
was confiscated and they were shipped off to concentration camps. None survived.

1731
01:49:47,46 --> 01:49:49,21
我们是朋友
We were friends.

1732
01:49:49,96 --> 01:49:51,96
我可以帮助他们
I could have helped them.

1733
01:49:53,72 --> 01:49:58,51
但是纳粹党给的条件太好
But the Nazis paid too well.

1734
01:50:00,47 --> 01:50:05,02
我能信任你会对这件事
Can I trust that you will keep what you've learned

1735
01:50:05,10 --> 01:50:08,44
守口如瓶吗？
here today confidential?

1736
01:50:09,48 --> 01:50:11,78
不管你怎么想
Despite whatever you may think?

1737
01:50:20,91 --> 01:50:22,54
没问题
Yes, Arthur.

1738
01:50:24,29 --> 01:50:27,46
我也很想骂你是个人渣
Well, I'd love to tell you what a monster you are,

1739
01:50:27,67 --> 01:50:31,80
不过我要替宾拉登的侄子买公寓
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1740
01:50:36,01 --> 01:50:38,51
如果是真的你就不会告诉我
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

1741
01:50:38,80 --> 01:50:41,01
我会把你列为他的担保人
We're listing you as a reference.

1742
01:50:55,44 --> 01:50:57,78
我的名字是道顿・罗素
My name is Dalton Russell.

1743
01:50:58,36 --> 01:51:00,16
请仔细听我说的话
Pay strict attention to what I say

1744
01:51:00,24 --> 01:51:03,87
因为我要说的话很重要，而且不会重覆一次
because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself.

1745
01:51:03,95 --> 01:51:06,66
我说出了名字，那是我的身份
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

1746
01:51:07,71 --> 01:51:11,38
我在的地方可以形容为囚房
The "where" could most readily be described as a prison cell.

1747
01:51:11,92 --> 01:51:13,50
但是被困在一个小囚房
But there is a vast difference

1748
01:51:13,59 --> 01:51:17,13
和坐牢有很大的不同
between being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison.

1749
01:51:18,84 --> 01:51:21,05
我做了什么事很容易解释
The "what" is easy.

1750
01:51:21,47 --> 01:51:26,18
最近我策划并执行一起完美的银行抢案
Recently I planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

1751
01:51:27,23 --> 01:51:29,19
我也说出了时间
That's also the "when."

1752
01:51:30,15 --> 01:51:34,53
至于为什么，除了很明显的财务动机
As for the "why," beyond the obvious financial motivation,

1753
01:51:35,23 --> 01:51:37,24
原因其实非常简单
it's exceedingly simple.

1754
01:51:37,40 --> 01:51:39,32
因为我办得到
Because I can.

1755
01:51:39,95 --> 01:51:42,24
现在只剩下我是怎么办到的
Which leaves us only with the "how."

1756
01:51:43,03 --> 01:51:46,04
就像大文豪莎士比亚说的
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

1757
01:51:47,12 --> 01:51:49,08
这就耐人寻味了
lies the rub.

1758
01:52:37,80 --> 01:52:41,43
-他一定会臭得要命 -一星期没洗澡当然会臭
-He's gonna smell like shit. -What do you expect after a week?

1759
01:52:43,80 --> 01:52:45,26
是啊
Yeah.

1760
01:52:45,30 --> 01:52:47,81
所以我才摇下车窗
Why do you think I rolled down the window?

1761
01:53:07,49 --> 01:53:09,04
糟糕
Oh, shit.

1762
01:53:14,17 --> 01:53:16,75
费警探和他的搭档走进银行
That cop, Frazier, and his partner are walking into the bank.

1763
01:53:16,84 --> 01:53:20,13
-他们来找我吗？ -不确定，只有他们俩
-Are they coming for me? -Can't say. It's just the two of them.

1764
01:53:27,76 --> 01:53:30,72
一切都没事
Yeah, everything's going great today. No.

1765
01:53:31,10 --> 01:53:34,06
对，五点半
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

1766
01:53:34,52 --> 01:53:37,06
听起来很好玩
Sounds like fun. Okay.

1767
01:53:37,86 --> 01:53:39,57
待会再聊
Talk to you later.

1768
01:54:00,80 --> 01:54:02,76
-对不起 -抱歉
-Sorry. -Excuse me.

1769
01:54:05,88 --> 01:54:07,26
韩先生？
Mr. Hammond?

1770
01:54:07,34 --> 01:54:09,10
早安，警探
Good morning, Detectives.

1771
01:54:12,68 --> 01:54:14,23
完全按照他的计划
Just like he planned.

1772
01:54:14,31 --> 01:54:16,90
我有搜票打开保险箱
I got a court order here to open a safe deposit box.

1773
01:54:16,98 --> 01:54:18,90
392号保险箱
Number 392.

1774
01:54:30,12 --> 01:54:31,87
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1775
01:54:37,62 --> 01:54:39,33
在哪里？
Where is it?

1776
01:54:39,79 --> 01:54:41,25
我留下来了
I left it in there.

1777
01:54:41,34 --> 01:54:43,05
这里请
This way, Detectives.

1778
01:54:43,09 --> 01:54:45,72
你把钻戒留给谁？
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1779
01:54:45,76 --> 01:54:47,38
相信我
Trust me.

1780
01:54:47,97 --> 01:54:49,72
对方很可靠
I left it in good hands.

1781
01:54:50,55 --> 01:54:52,31
我不是烈士
I'm no martyr.

1782
01:54:52,85 --> 01:54:54,60
我是为了钱
I did it for the money.

1783
01:54:56,27 --> 01:54:59,81
不过我也要对得起自己的良心
But it's not worth much if you can't face yourself in the mirror.

1784
01:55:00,77 --> 01:55:03,40
良知比金钱更重要
Respect is the ultimate currency.

1785
01:55:06,24 --> 01:55:10,16
我偷一个没有良知的人的钱
I was stealing from a man who traded his away for a few dollars.

1786
01:55:12,08 --> 01:55:14,54
他想用金钱洗清罪恶
And then he tried to wash away his guilt.

1787
01:55:15,66 --> 01:55:19,71
靠做善事获得尊重
Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds and a sea of respectability.

1788
01:55:20,50 --> 01:55:22,63
-让我来 -我自己来
-Let me get that. -Let me.

1789
01:55:22,71 --> 01:55:24,09
他也几乎成功了
It almost worked, too.

1790
01:55:24,17 --> 01:55:25,76
好吧
Okay.

1791
01:55:27,38 --> 01:55:28,93
然而
But inevitably,

1792
01:55:29,72 --> 01:55:32,01
你愈想逃避充满罪恶的过去
the further you run from your sins,

1793
01:55:32,72 --> 01:55:35,68
过去总有一天会追上来
the more exhausted you are when they catch up to you.

1794
01:55:36,02 --> 01:55:37,18
让你自食其果
And they do.

1795
01:55:37,27 --> 01:55:39,02
黄箭口香糖

1796
01:55:39,10 --> 01:55:40,60
好小子
Son of a bitch.

1797
01:55:40,69 --> 01:55:42,31
一定会
Certain.

1798
01:55:42,90 --> 01:55:44,86
这是不变的真理
It will not fail.

1799
01:55:46,74 --> 01:55:48,49
卡地亚-巴黎-伦敦-纽约

1800
01:55:48,99 --> 01:55:50,95
你猜这值多少钱？
What do you think that's worth?

1801
01:55:51,24 --> 01:55:53,91
你问我，你绝对买不起
If you got to ask, man, you can't afford it.

1802
01:55:53,99 --> 01:55:56,37
幸好我女朋友不在
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1803
01:55:56,45 --> 01:55:58,41
跟着钻戒走

1804
01:55:58,50 --> 01:56:00,46
“跟着钻戒走？”
"Follow the ring"?

1805
01:56:14,35 --> 01:56:17,27
-费警探 -寇先生
-Detective Frazier. -Mr. Case.

1806
01:56:17,47 --> 01:56:19,48
-你好吗？ -好得很
-How are you? -I am great.

1807
01:56:19,85 --> 01:56:23,27
银行没死人，皆大欢喜，我超爽的
Nobody got killed at the bank. Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1808
01:56:23,36 --> 01:56:25,32
太好了
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1809
01:56:25,40 --> 01:56:27,15
-米警探 -寇先生
-Detective Mitchell. -Mr. Case.

1810
01:56:27,19 --> 01:56:29,19
-两位请坐 -谢谢你
-Be seated, gentlemen. -Thank you.

1811
01:56:29,24 --> 01:56:31,53
-喝点什么吗？ -不了
-Can I offer you anything? -No.

1812
01:56:31,61 --> 01:56:33,20
老实说
I must say

1813
01:56:33,57 --> 01:56:36,04
我很佩服
I was most impressed

1814
01:56:37,20 --> 01:56:39,08
你们处理这件事的方法
by the way you handled that business.

1815
01:56:39,16 --> 01:56:40,50
谢谢夸奖
Thank you, Mr. Case.

1816
01:56:40,54 --> 01:56:42,50
你们真的是
Whenever I hear the term "New York's Finest"

1817
01:56:42,54 --> 01:56:44,29
人民保姆
you're who I think of.

1818
01:56:44,38 --> 01:56:47,63
保护平民老百姓的安全
You keep the rest of us safe and make it look easy.

1819
01:56:49,92 --> 01:56:52,30
-不好意思 -有什么好笑？
-Pardon me. -Well, what's so amusing?

1820
01:56:52,38 --> 01:56:55,35
你说平民老百姓，看看你自己
When you say "the rest of us," Mr. Case, I mean, you got to look around.

1821
01:56:55,39 --> 01:56:59,48
你应该不算是平民老百姓吧
"The rest of us" is a category that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1822
01:56:59,56 --> 01:57:02,27
说的好，我的确很成功
Touche, Detective. I won't deny it. I've done well.

1823
01:57:02,35 --> 01:57:04,52
没错，不过我搞不懂
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

1824
01:57:04,56 --> 01:57:06,36
这件案子
You see, I got a case

1825
01:57:07,07 --> 01:57:10,07
抢匪占据你的银行
where armed robbers laid siege to your bank.

1826
01:57:10,11 --> 01:57:11,45
那是你的银行，对吧？
It is your bank, right?

1827
01:57:11,53 --> 01:57:13,41
我是银行董事长
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1828
01:57:13,49 --> 01:57:15,20
然后…
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1829
01:57:15,24 --> 01:57:17,20
抢匪从人间蒸发
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1830
01:57:17,53 --> 01:57:18,91
一毛钱都没拿走
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1831
01:57:18,99 --> 01:57:21,33
-你在问我？ -对，我在问你
-You're asking me? -Yes, I'm asking you.

1832
01:57:21,41 --> 01:57:23,58
这是你的银行，我当然要问你
I mean, it's your bank. You own it. I'm asking you.

1833
01:57:23,67 --> 01:57:25,58
那只是我的企业的一小部份
It's a tiny part of our organization.

1834
01:57:25,63 --> 01:57:27,75
没有抢案、没有受害者，也没有丢掉一毛钱
No robbers. No real victims. No loot missing.

1835
01:57:27,84 --> 01:57:29,92
这一定是史上头一遭
It's got to be the first time in law-enforcement history.

1836
01:57:30,01 --> 01:57:31,17
我没听过这种怪事
I never heard of it before.

1837
01:57:31,26 --> 01:57:34,30
你一定会想，这是怎么回事？对不对？
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck happened?" Don't you, Mr. Case?

1838
01:57:34,39 --> 01:57:36,01
我不喜欢你的语气
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

1839
01:57:36,10 --> 01:57:38,43
不喜欢的话就说实话
You don't like my tone? Then give me a straight answer.

1840
01:57:38,51 --> 01:57:42,35
那是你开的第一家银行，也是你的心血结晶
It's the founding bank of your empire. You built it. It's your baby.

1841
01:57:42,43 --> 01:57:44,48
老实说，发生什么事？
Give me a straight answer. What do you think happened?

1842
01:57:44,56 --> 01:57:48,19
-我不知道 -少来这一套
-I have no idea. -Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1843
01:57:48,27 --> 01:57:49,69
让我告诉你吧
I'll tell you what I think happened.

1844
01:57:49,78 --> 01:57:51,90
你派那个女人搞定一件事
I think you sent that woman in there to patch things up.

1845
01:57:51,99 --> 01:57:54,53
你付钱请魏小姐办事，她替你办什么事？
Miss White. I think you paid her. What was she doing in there?

1846
01:57:54,61 --> 01:57:56,07
这太荒谬了
Look, this is absurd.

1847
01:57:56,16 --> 01:57:58,12
你在暗示我和抢案有关？
Are you implying that I had anything to do with it?

1848
01:57:58,05 --> 01:57:59,68
392.

1849
01:58:00,37 --> 01:58:02,87
392号保险箱是怎么回事？
Safe deposit box 392. What's the story on that?

1850
01:58:02,91 --> 01:58:05,54
392号
-I have no idea what you're... -Don't lie to me, Mr. Case.

1851
01:58:02,96 --> 01:58:05,33
-我不知道你在说什么？ -别想骗我

1852
01:58:05,42 --> 01:58:07,92
-我没有说谎 -我查过所有记录
-I don't lie. -I looked at all the records.

1853
01:58:07,96 --> 01:58:11,55
银行的每一个保险箱记录
All the bank records for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1854
01:58:11,71 --> 01:58:14,43
乍看之下没有问题
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1855
01:58:15,18 --> 01:58:17,51
但是有一个保险箱没有记录
but there was one safe deposit box that had no records.

1856
01:58:17,59 --> 01:58:19,56
从1948年起就没有记录
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1857
01:58:19,64 --> 01:58:22,77
我在想谁能解开这个谜？
So I started thinking. Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1858
01:58:22,85 --> 01:58:24,73
一定是1948年
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1859
01:58:24,81 --> 01:58:27,10
成立银行的人
that he built the bank in the first place in 1948.

1860
01:58:27,19 --> 01:58:29,94
这整件事都不对劲
It doesn't add up, Mr. Case. It does not add up.

1861
01:58:30,98 --> 01:58:35,28
我恐怕帮不了你的忙
I'm afraid I can't be of any further use to you, Detective.

1862
01:58:36,45 --> 01:58:38,95
你想隐藏一件可怕的秘密
It's something really bad, isn't it?

1863
01:58:39,66 --> 01:58:44,29
我一辈子都为社会奉献
Mr. Frazier, I have spent my whole life serving humanity.

1864
01:58:45,75 --> 01:58:47,79
你可以问我的朋友
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1865
01:58:49,08 --> 01:58:52,09
他们都会替我说好话，我做了太多善事了
They'll vouch for me, and for the things that I've done.

1866
01:58:52,17 --> 01:58:55,22
我查出这只钻戒的真相，他们还会替你说话吗？
You think they'll vouch for you after I find out the truth about this ring?

1867
01:58:55,30 --> 01:58:57,05
应该不会吧
I don't think so.

1868
01:59:01,35 --> 01:59:04,39
你说我们是人民保母
Oh, by the way, that thing you said about us being New York's finest?

1869
01:59:04,48 --> 01:59:07,10
多谢夸奖
I want you to know, we really appreciate that.

1870
01:59:07,73 --> 01:59:09,48
你真是客气
How gracious.

1871
01:59:09,90 --> 01:59:12,57
走吧，咱们要跟着钻戒走
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1872
01:59:19,57 --> 01:59:22,16
-老兄，让我看你的鞋子 -什么？
-Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe. -What?

1873
01:59:22,20 --> 01:59:24,62
-让我看你的鞋子 -为什么？
-Let me see your shoe. -Why?

1874
01:59:24,70 --> 01:59:27,92
你狠狠地踩到那老家伙的痛处
'Cause I have never seen anybody put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1875
01:59:30,83 --> 01:59:32,50
我猜是吧
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

1876
01:59:32,59 --> 01:59:35,17
你把他踩到无地自容
Oh, man. You cut him an ass the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1877
01:59:35,26 --> 01:59:37,59
他巴不得想挖个洞钻进去
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1878
01:59:46,52 --> 01:59:47,68
您好
Good afternoon, sir.

1879
01:59:47,77 --> 01:59:49,69
-您有订位吗？ -我来找市长
-Do you have a reservation? -Looking for the Mayor.

1880
01:59:49,73 --> 01:59:51,73
-请把帽子给我 -不行，你自己去买
-May I have your hat, please? -No, you cannot. Get your own.

1881
01:59:51,81 --> 01:59:54,40
他们要在四年内投资四十亿
They're looking to invest $4 billion over the next four years.

1882
01:59:54,48 --> 01:59:55,65
资金都到位了
And that's all in place.

1883
01:59:55,73 --> 01:59:58,70
市长先生，抱歉打扰了，不过有句美国名言说…
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Mayor, but there's an old American saying,

1884
01:59:58,74 --> 02:00:02,53
“只要街头喋血，就会有人坐牢”
"When there's blood on the streets, somebody's got to go to jail."

1885
02:00:03,20 --> 02:00:06,20
请你离开一下
Edwin, could you please excuse us for a minute?

1886
02:00:08,29 --> 02:00:09,87
有什么事？
What's this about, Detective?

1887
02:00:09,96 --> 02:00:13,50
费警探想要一个圆满结局
I believe Detective Frazier is looking for some closure?

1888
02:00:13,84 --> 02:00:16,09
说的好，圆满结局
That's a good word. Closure.

1889
02:00:16,17 --> 02:00:18,76
我要结案，了吗？
Case closed, you know what I mean?

1890
02:00:18,84 --> 02:00:20,18
这是
This is the number

1892
02:00:25,93 --> 02:00:28,56
你想登上『纽约时报』头版吗？
How'd you like to be on the front page of the New York Times?

1893
02:00:28,60 --> 02:00:29,73
棒呆了
That'd be great.

1894
02:00:29,81 --> 02:00:33,15
确定他们写对我的名字，费雪
Make sure they spell my name right, though. That's Frazier with a "z".

1895
02:00:34,27 --> 02:00:36,19
录音笔留着吧
You can keep the pen.

1896
02:00:36,53 --> 02:00:38,40
你有拷贝吗？
You made copies?

1897
02:00:39,61 --> 02:00:41,20
放心吧
Please.

1898
02:00:41,28 --> 02:00:44,66
我得去抓真正的罪犯
We got to keep the real criminals off the streets, Your Honor.

1899
02:00:46,12 --> 02:00:48,79
好了，多谢请客
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1900
02:00:53,17 --> 02:00:54,88
战争罪？
War crimes, huh?

1901
02:00:55,54 --> 02:00:57,76
这次你把我扯进什么事？
What have you got me into this time?

1902
02:01:17,36 --> 02:01:18,98
宝贝？
Mama?

1903
02:01:23,16 --> 02:01:25,91
-你回来了 -还带了一鸟二石
-Did you bring Big Willie? -And the twins.

1904
02:01:39,55 --> 02:01:40,80
别急
Slow down, girl.

1905
02:01:40,88 --> 02:01:43,26
我先把枪放下再掏另一把枪
I'll get my gun off before I get my gun off, okay?

1906
02:01:43,34 --> 02:01:44,80
砰
Pow, pow.

1907
02:01:52,64 --> 02:01:56,86
费基斯升任为高级警探

1908
02:02:26,55 --> 02:02:28,55
-对不起 -抱歉
-Sorry. -Excuse me.

1909
02:02:29,01 --> 02:02:31,68
-你何不走出大门？ -我会的
-Why don't you just walk out the door? -I will.

1910
02:02:32,06 --> 02:02:34,94
我准备好就会大摇大摆走出去
I'm gonna walk out of that door when I'm good and ready.

1911
02:02:35,02 --> 02:02:36,65
好家伙
Son of a bitch.

1912
02:02:43,69 --> 02:02:46,57
快点啦，手铐都冰了
Come on, honey. The handcuffs are getting cold.

1913
02:08:35,38 --> 02:08:36,34
剧终
