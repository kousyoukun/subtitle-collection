1
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,308
When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.

2
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,185
It was all just cops and robbers.

3
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,340
Fucking get down! Get down now!

4
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,620
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

5
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,582
But it wasn't for me.

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,900
Then came the Summer of Love.

7
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,182
Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene.

8
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,346
There were villains lock ed away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand,

9
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,110
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,905
for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.

11
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,705
I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.

12
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,099
Drugs changed everything.

13
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,378
Always remember that one day all
this drug monk ey-business will be legal.

14
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,662
They won't leave it to people lik e me
when they figure out

15
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,422
how much money there is to be made:
Not millions, fucking billions.

16
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,101
Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.

17
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,143
Good times today, stupor tomorrow.

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,143
But this is now.

19
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,138
So, until prohibition ends,
mak e hay while the sun shines.

20
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,145
I'm not against it.

21
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,138
I'm a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.

22
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,060
Ten years ago, charlie was for pop stars
or a celebrity's birthday bash.

23
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,149
It was demonised by Daily Mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars.

24
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,463
Now they're my biggest clients.

25
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,261
This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge
in Industrial Chemistry.

26
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,143
Well, he's got to pay off
his student loan somehow.

27
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,065
Today, I only deal in kilos.

28
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,862
Depending which tariff you use,

29
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,540
that'll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison,

30
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,786
which is more time than a rapist.

31
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,461
C'est la vie.

32
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,061
It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.

33
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,101
Always work in a small team.

34
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,861
Keep a very low profile. Only deal with
people who come recommended.

35
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,742
It's lik e selling anything:

36
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,225
Washing machines,
hand-made shoes, blow-jobs.

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,139
As long as you don't tak e the piss,
people will always come back for more.

38
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,468
That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that mak es two kilos into three,

39
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,343
but never be too greedy.

40
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,462
Know and respect your enemy.

41
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,027
It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.

42
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,180
And av oid lik e the fucking plague

43
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,223
loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters,

44
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,944
in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.

45
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,746
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, this is Duke.

46
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,226
Everything's sweet. When can we meet?

47
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,469
They don't mean to fuck up. They just do.

48
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,307
Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.

49
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,028
They are guaranteed to bring you trouble.

50
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,380
As do guns.

51
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,785
I hate guns. And violence.

52
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,187
But as some Roman general once said,

53
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,427
"If you seek peace, plan for war."

54
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,418
Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.

55
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,748
Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did ten years inside.

56
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,783
He's my bridge to the criminal world, and
he ensures that the traffic is one way.

57
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,069
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe... dorfe.

58
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,706
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

59
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,549
- Get in the car. I'm sure it's that way.
- Move up.

60
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,548
- I bet you it's that way.
- We've already been that way.

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,663
Yeah, but we're gonna go that way again.
Give us the map.

62
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,258
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

63
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,859
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

64
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,745
- All day you've been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

65
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,669
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

66
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,380
Morty.

67
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,989
Terence.

68
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,418
Clarkie.

69
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,264
Very, very important:
Pay your supplier prompt.

70
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,588
In our case, that's Mr Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.

71
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,669
Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.

72
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,909
You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.

73
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,467
Where the fuck is Gene?

74
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,106
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

75
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,187
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

76
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,618
Shut the fuck up.

77
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,542
Patience.

78
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,310
Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.

79
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,466
Been with him since way back.

80
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,309
All the drugs and cash go through Gene.

81
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,785
Jimmy trusts him with his life.

82
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,744
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

83
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,588
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

84
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,261
Why does everybody assume there's a
problem, just because he wants a word?

85
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,782
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

86
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,821
See you at Stoke Park at one.

87
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,429
This is just so beautiful.

88
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,905
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

89
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,022
Paul and the tide ain't gonna wait.

90
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,382
Everyone lik es to walk
through a door mark ed "Private".

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,980
Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.

92
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,750
I own a share
in a very successful letting agency.

93
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,989
It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.

94
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,980
Whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks,

95
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,978
now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.

96
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,988
That's a job for Mr Singh.
He does my laundry.

97
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,579
And in a week,
it will be ready for collection,

98
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,944
in the form of a nice, clean cheque
for a round million.

99
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,261
The business is on the up and up.

100
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,462
But I've always said,
have a plan and stick to it.

101
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,581
Quit while you're ahead.

102
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,623
So barring any fuck-ups,
I'm leaving it all behind.

103
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,821
No, we got the parcel.

104
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,225
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

105
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,945
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

106
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,382
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

107
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,707
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

108
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,698
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.
You're being paid to get my cargo home.

109
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,823
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

110
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,262
Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.

111
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,828
I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like a Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.

112
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,305
And then leave quietly forever.

113
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,701
This is pure class.

114
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,260
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

115
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,665
Mr Price is in the Oval Room.

116
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,899
- Your guests, Mr Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

117
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,908
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

118
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,102
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

119
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,870
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

120
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,822
We all have to do our bit.

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,828
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

122
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,625
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

123
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,582
Let's eat.

124
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,104
Right.

125
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,620
We've gotta test the snap-crackle-and-pop
factor on these babies.

126
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,663
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching 'em.

127
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,065
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

128
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,582
- Brian.
- What?

129
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,499
Sit down, mate. Got a little treat for you.

130
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,341
Help yourself.

131
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,101
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

132
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,621
What do you want, son?

133
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,060
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

134
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,026
A shot at the title? A seat by the band?

135
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,863
Well, I don't know, Mr Price.
That's a very expansive question.

136
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,459
Right, expansive. Good answer.

137
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,867
Years ago, people would've
thought you were a homosexual,

138
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,788
using a word like "expansive".

139
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,504
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

140
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,588
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

141
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,906
No, I didn't think you were.

142
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,102
No harm in it, I suppose. Times change.

143
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,909
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

144
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,348
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

145
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,020
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favour.

146
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,381
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

147
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,787
Not a two-a-penny loud-mouth.
Too many grasses around.

148
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,099
- It would be a pleasure, Mr Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

149
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,100
Now, this favour. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

150
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,542
Like a blood-brother.
We were at school together.

151
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,547
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

152
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,583
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

153
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,899
I'll give you a clue. Eddie Temple.
Does that name mean anything to you?

154
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,704
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

155
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,741
Charlie, bless her.

156
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,579
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

157
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,348
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

158
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,702
Or to give her her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

159
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,346
But she ain't behaving like a lady.

160
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,383
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong 'un.

161
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,344
This is where you come in, right?
You're gonna find her.

162
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,788
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

163
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,106
Well, you should get a private detective.

164
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:29,306
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

165
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,503
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

166
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,938
Rehab.

167
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,429
She got loved up in there with some
fucking low-life crackhead called Kinky.

168
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,586
I reckon they've gone back to London.

169
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,542
I wouldn't know where to begin.

170
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,538
Now and then we're asked
to do something beyond the call of duty.

171
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,019
It's called sacrifice, son.
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

172
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,388
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

173
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,024
Keep Mr McGuire posted.

174
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,782
I've also got a little business
more in your usual line.

175
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,662
Gene'll fill you in.

176
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,861
Everything was to your satisfaction?

177
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,584
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

178
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,583
"Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

179
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,907
"Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done."

180
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,307
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

181
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,540
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

182
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,819
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

183
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:49,388
Tell you about that bit of business.
I've set up a meet for five with the Duke.

184
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,181
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

185
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,506
These are super Es. We'll make millions!

186
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,259
I don't care. This is my boat-yard.

187
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,542
I want those pills
and that fucking idiot out of here now.

188
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,548
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

189
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,060
I've got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You'll be in your whack.

190
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,103
Here, chill. Have a pill.

191
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,138
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

192
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,818
Yeah, why are we dealing with this joker?

193
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,103
He's a fucking maniac, a relic,
a throw-back, belongs to the Dark Ages.

194
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,380
Will you just shut the fuck up?

195
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,548
We're dealing with him because
he has 1 million Ecstasy pills

196
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,423
of very high levels of MDMA, OK?

197
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,700
One million?

198
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,947
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

199
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,943
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger, this lot.

200
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,142
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

201
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,387
Calm down. You'll feel better
once you've got your money.

202
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,946
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

203
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,502
Come on.

204
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,907
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, OK?

205
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,748
Who? Me?

206
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,829
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I'm some kind of mug.

207
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,626
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

208
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,900
You want to know
how much they're worth.

209
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,021
Yes! Fucking! Please!

210
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,666
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market,

211
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,545
don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

212
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,978
They're not.

213
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,021
We've got to find a buyer.

214
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,587
They've got to split them into parcels.
They've got to find these people.

215
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,543
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

216
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,426
Then you've got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

217
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,748
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

218
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,908
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

219
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,148
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

220
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,549
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth five million easy.

221
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,980
- £5 each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

222
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,942
It doesn't work like that!

223
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,621
Don't keep fucking saying that to me!

224
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,459
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, OK?

225
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,742
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

226
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,340
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?

227
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,066
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

228
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,830
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

229
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,827
We know someone up North who'll buy.

230
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,739
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

231
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,262
What's really bothering me
is what colour to get the Aston.

232
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,542
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

233
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,342
- Green?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,542
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

235
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,308
Black. Yeah, black.

236
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,899
Black's the colour for a hearse or a taxi.

237
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,307
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

238
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,468
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

239
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,345
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

240
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,506
Hugo, follow me.

241
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,099
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

242
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,505
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

243
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,225
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

244
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,819
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

245
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,464
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

246
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,548
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

247
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,583
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

248
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,224
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

249
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,742
- How quickly?
- 20 grand quickly.

250
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,906
You've got our attention.

251
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,059
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

252
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,500
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

253
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,669
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

254
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,985
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.

255
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,146
Chuck 'em a few quid, they'll cough.

256
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,907
- Is there anything else?
- No.

257
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,021
We must get back to work, old boy.

258
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,508
Look...

259
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,147
All right, mate. I'm the Duke's nephew.

260
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,147
Remember me? Sidney.

261
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,025
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are you?
I'm just off. Have a nice night.

262
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,948
How you doing?
What you doing here?

263
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,108
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

264
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,824
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

265
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,585
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

266
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,339
He's a good mate of my uncle's, the Duke.
He was just going.

267
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,225
Yeah, well stick around and have a drink
before you do, yeah?

268
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,379
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

269
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,821
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

270
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,306
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

271
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,140
If you want anything, just tell me,
'cause I got 'em straightened out in here.

272
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,262
If you want any running about,
I'm your man...

273
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,379
- Line?
- What?

274
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,024
I said do you want a line?

275
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,779
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

276
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,227
Lovely, isn't she? Isn't she a darling?

277
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,988
Isn't she?

278
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,829
Siddy, baby, I could do with a livener.

279
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,701
Sidney, it's been great. I'll see you, man.
Thanks for the champagne.

280
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,866
All right.

281
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,903
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr Lucky.

282
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,500
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

283
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,306
- Everyone wants a slice as well.
- Same wherever you go. Greedy people.

284
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,149
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

285
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,740
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

286
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,066
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

287
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,422
Well, not you lot, but...

288
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,098
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

289
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,029
No offence, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

290
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,428
You really do surprise me,
do you know that?

291
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,825
Do you know something we don't?

292
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,150
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

293
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,901
Because I am not a fucking prick.

294
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,820
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it, Shanks. They really don't know.

295
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,386
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

296
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,387
Last weekend, right?

297
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,866
The whole place is alight with a rumour

298
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,107
about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end,

299
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,986
run by this joker called the Duke...

300
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,901
- Gazza, go and find them fucking pills.
- All right. Come on. Have a look in here.

301
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,539
They skank ed this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.

302
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,584
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

303
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,109
Shut up.

304
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,346
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

305
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,381
Shut up or I'll be the last.

306
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,904
Fuck me.

307
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,749
They got lucky.
He'd just knock ed up a massive batch.

308
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,978
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

309
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,304
Stay down there. Yes?

310
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,860
You watch them.

311
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,905
- That looks very heavy for you, darling.
- Fuck off.

312
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,349
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

313
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,782
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl. Shut up!

314
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,059
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

315
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,908
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

316
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,180
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

317
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,499
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

318
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,789
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

319
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,506
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

320
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,269
This will not be the end of this,
Mr Duke, believe me.

321
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,258
Gazza, go and load them pills.

322
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,509
But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.

323
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,703
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

324
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,665
They're wanted by the United
fucking Nations. Think about that.

325
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,349
Let's get this clear.

326
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,943
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

327
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,142
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

328
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,944
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

329
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,587
Word on the straat is they've unleashed
their top boy. His name is...

330
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,942
His party piece, right,

331
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,984
is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

332
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:19,663
It's all about honour and respect with
these head-banging nationalist outfits.

333
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,580
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

334
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,624
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

335
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,628
OK, we accept that.

336
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,301
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

337
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,744
Bad.

338
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,743
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

339
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,740
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

340
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:59,268
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.
Me and him need to have a little think.

341
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,940
Don't think too long. Someone's
gonna make a killing on these pills.

342
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,462
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

343
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,019
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

344
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,064
I told you he was trouble. But he ain't
gonna drag me down with him.

345
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,387
Try Gene again. What a fucking show-up!

346
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,789
- He's not answering, Mort.
- OK.

347
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,740
Try Jimmy at home.

348
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,906
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

349
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,946
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boat-yard.

350
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,543
- Somebody's about to get a fucking slap.
- Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

351
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,783
Paul?

352
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:37,899
What a way to go. An iron burning a hole
in your chest until your heart boils.

353
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,068
Paulie would've told him anything, then,
wouldn't he?

354
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:48,149
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

355
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,382
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make some
phone calls, but really quietly.

356
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,263
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

357
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,030
We're gonna need an insurance policy.

358
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,382
What's the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, you prick!

359
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,425
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!

360
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,383
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills ain't worth shit?

361
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,546
You don't know
the problems you've caused.

362
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,028
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes,

363
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,902
to find that bitch Charlie.

364
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,749
I fucking told you to do it!

365
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,340
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

366
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,859
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

367
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,298
I don't give a fuck!

368
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,307
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

369
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,627
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

370
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,708
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

371
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,346
No, I haven't. He's in here.

372
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,145
Kinky.

373
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,069
I still want to be paid.

374
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,830
So, if I'm correct, you three gearheads
are gonna be clucking very soon.

375
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,659
In fact, you're gonna be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

376
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,338
But I'm prepared to do you a favour.

377
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,189
We can do this one of two ways.

378
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,745
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you'll prefer.

379
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,259
Because the other way
is my friend takes you

380
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,540
and puts your head
through the window!

381
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,425
Right, so, was Charlie here with Kinky?

382
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,543
Yeah, she was here for a couple of days.
Kinky turned up with five grand.

383
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,583
- Who's giving Kinky five grand?
- We don't know.

384
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,907
They k ept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy

385
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,466
"taking the five grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.

386
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,342
Where is she now?

387
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,303
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

388
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,219
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there. It's dark.

389
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,946
But I sees this geezer all in black.
It's like something out of a kung-fu film.

390
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,541
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

391
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,504
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

392
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,669
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

393
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,338
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

394
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,905
You telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

395
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,624
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

396
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,786
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

397
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,902
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

398
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,260
Shut the fuck up!

399
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,426
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

400
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,904
Get the fucking money!

401
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,704
Morty! Morty!

402
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,140
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

403
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,228
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

404
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,308
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.

405
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,423
- All right. And ten G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

406
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,626
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

407
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,141
Hello. Ambulance, please.

408
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,626
185 Kirby House, Kings Cross.

409
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,426
There's a dead boy. The door's open.

410
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,702
My name...?

411
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,468
185 Kirby House.

412
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,063
I'm not happy.

413
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,141
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out or I'll sort you out.

414
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,625
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

415
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,745
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off down to Brighton.

416
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,100
Cody's gonna find her.

417
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,221
Look, I'm gonna freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

418
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,429
Morty?

419
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,108
Is that you?

420
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,460
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

421
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,899
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

422
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,468
Hello, Freddie.

423
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,505
So...

424
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,468
...Mr Mortimer.

425
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:20,107
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us a few quid,
for old times' sake?

426
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,140
You look well flush, bruv.

427
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,300
Fuck me, he's loaded.

428
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,421
Here, couldn't make it five, could you...

429
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,947
...mate?

430
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,584
- Let's make it ten.
- Yeah.

431
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,746
Ten's...

432
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,509
...a nice...

433
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,582
...round number.

434
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,869
What's the matter?

435
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,584
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

436
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,345
Going off? Or do you need a red light?

437
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,819
Stop, Morty. Enough. He's had enough.

438
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,148
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

439
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,062
But let's forget about all that.

440
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,500
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr Hurst.

441
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,108
What the fuck?

442
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,098
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

443
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,982
- It's me.
- Hey.

444
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,385
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.

445
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,742
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

446
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,783
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.

447
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,469
No, I'm fine, thank you.

448
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,542
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

449
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,538
He used to run with me, Morty and Jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm.

450
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,140
In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.

451
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,739
Yeah. Got shot, didn't he? Bit of a lunatic.

452
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,828
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.

453
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,986
Always doing loads of drugs.

454
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,823
- Not worried about k eeping a low profile.
- I love you.

455
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,180
Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.

456
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,699
No fucking problem. Boys will be boys.

457
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,664
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...

458
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,462
...shoots himself stone dead.

459
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,181
This is a bit of a dilemma.

460
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,019
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

461
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,028
Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty,

462
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,425
actually v olunteered
to dispose of the body.

463
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,622
No head. But things went a bit wrong.

464
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,140
The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.

465
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,786
The total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights

466
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,584
in a drunk en, drug-induced stupor.

467
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,625
Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.

468
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,469
Being black
was even worse than being Irish.

469
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,581
They threw the book at Morty.

470
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,099
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

471
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,427
Morty did ten years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

472
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,746
But he kept his mouth shut.

473
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,943
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

474
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,621
All because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic.

475
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:37,062
- Who?
- But you, you fuck!

476
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,589
Larry.

477
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,544
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

478
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,060
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

479
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,465
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

480
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,581
Probably.

481
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,580
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

482
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,347
Not for me.

483
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,140
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

484
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,626
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain haemorrhage.

485
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,629
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

486
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,027
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty

487
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,985
or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

488
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,265
You know, I will have one of those.

489
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,783
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

490
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,299
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

491
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,742
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

492
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,546
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs babysit these.

493
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,862
Gene, what the fuck
am I gonna do about these Serbs?

494
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,343
Come here. I have something for you.

495
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,108
- You're gonna need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

496
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,746
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

497
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,589
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

498
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,862
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

499
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,630
Hey, point it upwards.

500
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,745
Oh, for fuck's sake.

501
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,344
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

502
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,619
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

503
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,981
I can and I do.

504
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:05,628
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

505
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,385
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task

506
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,060
so the rest of the mind can find peace.

507
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,504
And you find peace with guns.

508
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,666
Well, on occasion. It has been known.

509
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,585
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

510
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,664
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never, ever tell a living soul.

511
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,341
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.

512
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,500
How did you get this number?

513
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,828
Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.

514
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,500
I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer,

515
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,305
and you're the person I should talk to
about the return of this cargo,

516
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,024
stolen by your associate, the Duk e.

517
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,064
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

518
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:29,105
Mr Duk e came to Amsterdam,
used your name, said he work ed for you.

519
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,500
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...

520
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,467
I've got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

521
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,219
I'll squeeze some orange juice
and we'll talk about this like adults.

522
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,581
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.

523
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,508
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

524
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,268
Well, fuck off, then.

525
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,982
Duk e's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.

526
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,307
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

527
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,786
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.

528
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,744
Well, you've got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I'm sending 'em back, OK?

529
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,862
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

530
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,745
It ain't worth the grief. We've gone
underground, off the radar.

531
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,259
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

532
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,102
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

533
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,906
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

534
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,149
Between you and that gobshite Duke,
he's promised Jimmy a bumper pay-day.

535
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,818
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

536
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,861
He put yous together.

537
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,903
You and Duke. That's his job.

538
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:07,582
If you two can't make music, he's gonna
want his whack out either way.

539
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,662
That's business.

540
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,704
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

541
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,549
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

542
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,662
Well, I am beginning to regret it now.

543
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,147
We've got to find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

544
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,864
We can't rely
on these monkeys to call Gene.

545
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,538
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

546
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,820
You can't find any of his firm?

547
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,865
Maybe this Dragan geezer's already found
the Duke and done the business.

548
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:53,142
Yeah, well, there is someone I can call.
Keep looking.

549
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,228
Wait. You're gonna leave it to us?

550
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,866
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

551
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,825
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

552
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,068
- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.

553
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,546
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.

554
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,469
- You sound sleepy. You just woken up?
- Not long ago.

555
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,266
- So when am I gonna see you?
- What are you doing now?

556
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:31,066
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

557
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,420
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.

558
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,548
- You lying there naked?
- I've got a little T-shirt on. But that's all.

559
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,820
Here, wait, listen to this.

560
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,542
What's that?

561
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,389
I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.

562
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,739
Did you lik e it?
My, oh my, it's fresh this morning.

563
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:07,185
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

564
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:12,464
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?
I'll book a table for lunch.

565
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,898
St Martin's Hotel.

566
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,908
Don't worry about a table.
We'll have room service.

567
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,941
- Yeah, OK.
- One hour.

568
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,826
Hang on.

569
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,625
Oh, shit.

570
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,342
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

571
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,021
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

572
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,709
Not round here, I hope.

573
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,062
No, over by Greenwich market.
So you can relax. It's just the two of us.

574
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,699
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

575
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,983
Stay put.

576
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,788
Hello, it's me. It's me. Shut up and listen.

577
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,029
Sidney, Duke's nephew is working down
by Greenwich Market. Go and look.

578
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,941
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

579
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,458
OK.

580
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,386
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

581
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:25,067
One moment, Mr Troop. I want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself.

582
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,703
I'm Jimmy's old colleague, Eddie Temple.

583
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,584
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

584
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,065
Hunt her down like some lost mongrel.

585
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,544
He said you asked for his help.

586
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,825
Mr Troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat.

587
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,627
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

588
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,548
You'd join that shit, Kinky,

589
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,867
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over.

590
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,542
The audacity. How fucking dare you?

591
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:18,186
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

592
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,984
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

593
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,499
Do you know what a remora fish is?

594
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,619
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

595
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:35,022
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

596
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:39,223
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

597
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,581
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

598
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,941
But you keep very, very bad company.

599
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,265
You know, I host
a charity golf tournament every year.

600
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,621
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

601
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:01,063
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious.

602
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,943
Drinks are on me. Drinks for everyone.

603
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,903
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

604
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:12,707
But I've come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

605
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,947
Jimmy, as usual
on the look out for titbits,

606
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,223
has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.

607
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,785
They're trawling the West
for investments.

608
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,905
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

609
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,819
They've sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.

610
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:36,820
Profits, shares, long-term investments,
short-term investments.

611
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:43,060
They've even made him an honorary
citizen. Even made him one of the tribe.

612
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:47,229
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears,

613
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,660
was that the hard-line
communist insurgents

614
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:53,545
who control the country
outside the mining areas...

615
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,344
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.

616
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,347
The communists have broken through.

617
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,700
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

618
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,741
What the fuck are you on about?

619
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:04,986
I got word they were planning a push.

620
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,260
The final coup de grâce. I told Jimmy.

621
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,222
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

622
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,945
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

623
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,745
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

624
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:21,068
Now, I explained that wasn't possible.
We thought we'd bought a government.

625
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,830
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

626
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,543
You win some, you lose some.

627
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,868
How much are we talking?

628
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,788
It's only a cheeky half-mill, Jim.

629
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,505
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

630
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,543
- 13.
- 13 what?

631
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:42,825
- 13 million pounds. I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

632
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:50,584
13 million pounds!
How could you be so fucking stupid?

633
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:53,429
You've been right grafted,
royally turned over.

634
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,145
- Like some Yank buying London Bridge.
- Don't talk to me like that.

635
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,181
He accused me of instigating it.

636
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,745
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

637
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,781
Are you fucking demented?

638
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,140
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister,

639
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:10,059
still parked up
in La Maison Grande, still eating well.

640
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:15,025
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

641
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,825
Jimmy thought he'd keep Charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money.

642
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:23,899
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

643
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,338
I'm sorry, what?

644
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,462
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

645
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,865
If I find you trying to find her,

646
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,788
I do his dirty work.

647
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:37,899
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

648
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,869
I've found out something
very interesting about Jimmy,

649
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,742
something I've long suspected.

650
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,263
But I'll let Jimmy explain.

651
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,938
You follow me.

652
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,388
You've no doubt suffered Jimmy's

653
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,502
"CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

654
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,587
The other chap's Albert Carter.

655
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,258
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighbourhood.

656
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,861
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax and enjoy.

657
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,584
It ain't lik e your lot in the old days.

658
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,463
- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.

659
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:04,379
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

660
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,744
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- It's the going rate, Jim.

661
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,269
Ten K. Hardly seems worth the bother.

662
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:18,669
Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.

663
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,867
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

664
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:29,621
What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...

665
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,946
...is too loyal for his own good.

666
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,908
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

667
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,261
- 'Cause it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

668
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,548
Mr Troop made it for me.

669
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,942
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

670
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,699
Don't you want to hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

671
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:56,745
I've got one for you.
Pluck ed and ready for the pot.

672
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,501
- Just give us a name and he's gone.
- In time.

673
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,304
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.

674
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:07,185
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?

675
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:11,429
Reck ons he can just waltz off
into retirement.

676
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,190
I want him away for 12.

677
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,587
If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.

678
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,509
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

679
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,429
He's got a few quid.
He'll come in handy.

680
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:27,669
I set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place.

681
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,179
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?

682
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,588
"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr Price."

683
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:39,386
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

684
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,741
You'd no idea what Jimmy was up to?

685
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,339
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

686
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,702
I would've thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

687
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,220
- Can I have that?
- Mr Troop.

688
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,821
Thank you.

689
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,858
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

690
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,460
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

691
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,742
Opera tonight. The Damnation of Faust.

692
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:15,546
Man sells his soul to the devil. All ends
in tears. These arrangements usually do.

693
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,984
One more thing, young man.

694
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:31,865
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

695
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,026
Bye-bye.

696
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,942
Fuck!

697
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,863
- I've got him.
- Got who?

698
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,024
Sidney, remember? Yellow Range Rover?

699
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,983
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

700
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,909
Good. Tell Morty.

701
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,745
- So what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

702
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:48,581
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.

703
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,907
If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.

704
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:57,059
Dragan, I've been doing some checking.

705
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,340
- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.

706
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,144
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

707
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,942
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...

708
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:08,905
- I'd rather meet you in a public place.
- You have nothing to fear.

709
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:13,979
- I'm a reasonable man.
- That's not what I've heard.

710
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,420
I'll meet you at...

711
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:22,226
I'll meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

712
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:25,149
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.

713
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:28,899
- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.

714
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,025
I'll be there.

715
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,824
That's rude, Mr Dragan.

716
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:52,107
It's Conditions Red down there.

717
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:56,144
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lock-up.

718
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,308
Have a look at the geezer at the front,
on the door.

719
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,068
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

720
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,067
What about the blokes in red?

721
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,579
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

722
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,543
The lorries come in one colour,
go out another.

723
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,900
But they're nothing to do with the Duke.

724
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,544
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

725
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,100
It doesn't matter. I've got work to do.

726
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:25,427
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

727
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,702
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean "night"?

728
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:32,505
- I've been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

729
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,628
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

730
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:01,618
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

731
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,789
I'm in the best of health, Mr Temple.
Thank you for asking.

732
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,860
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.

733
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,346
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.

734
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:15,462
No wonder it took him 60 years to write it.

735
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:17,581
How's the family?

736
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,667
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

737
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,748
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

738
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:25,145
Being a clever bastard, are we?

739
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:29,104
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.

740
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,859
Then we'll have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

741
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,823
I've been thinking, after
our chat the other day.

742
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:45,340
Your pills. How much for the lot?

743
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:49,466
No, I've already got a buyer.

744
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,821
Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.

745
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,305
I told you, lah. I'm still thinking.

746
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,661
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

747
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,509
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

748
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,826
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

749
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,782
They've got history.

750
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:09,265
Bad juju.

751
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:13,463
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

752
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:18,425
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely not...

753
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:23,658
I did you a big fucking favour
letting you know about Jimmy.

754
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,179
I think you owe me.

755
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,186
2½ million in sterling and euros,
high-denomination used notes.

756
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:35,702
So if I gave you three million,
that would keep everyone happy.

757
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,707
Let me state my position.

758
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:41,145
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

759
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:44,581
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

760
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,906
But I'll tell you,

761
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:52,184
I'll be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell 'em to me.

762
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,460
You understand?

763
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:02,062
OK, Mr Temple. Three million. Done.

764
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:07,229
- My buyer's not gonna be happy, though.
- Fuck him. He'll get over it.

765
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:18,424
I'm gonna need some help.

766
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,349
Someone who can eliminate the problem.
Someone who's a bit handy.

767
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:26,303
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

768
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:30,985
Mr Lucky does a drop of freelance work.

769
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,226
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

770
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,460
You tell him when,
and he'll come down on the train.

771
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:43,546
Thanks, Trev.

772
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,748
Excuse me.

773
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,378
Mr Temple.

774
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:56,104
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

775
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,744
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

776
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,384
Tuesday? I'm paying
over the odds, remember?

777
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:04,900
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

778
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,898
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

779
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:25,023
Yeah, everything's under control.

780
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:32,025
- Cody's been chasing his ten grand.
- Yeah. I'll call him later.

781
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,898
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

782
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,589
Oh, yeah? What's that?

783
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,665
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

784
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,306
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

785
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,103
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

786
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:56,188
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

787
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,826
- Open this fucking door!
- Why?

788
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:02,420
Open this fucking door!

789
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:10,589
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

790
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:16,023
Listen to me, Morty.
I got a call from a cozzer we've got bent.

791
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,539
They found Jimmy's body last night.

792
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,822
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

793
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,260
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

794
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,143
All right, look. Here. We'll see.

795
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:28,942
Read it. Read it out loud.

796
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:33,063
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

797
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,579
Read the fucking ballistics report.

798
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:39,624
"Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

799
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,502
"One recovered cartridge casing."

800
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:45,749
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

801
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,906
"...consistent with weapon used

802
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,468
"in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower aka Crazy Larry Flynn."

803
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:58,300
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.

804
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:02,503
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

805
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:05,065
The one he stole from my flat.

806
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:09,821
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

807
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:13,340
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

808
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:21,868
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

809
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:26,860
- He was a police informer!
- Jimmy a grass? Are you fucking mad?

810
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:30,665
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.

811
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:34,146
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

812
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:39,424
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

813
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,305
If he's lying, we'll both fucking kill him.

814
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:45,626
Mr Mortimer reck ons

815
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:51,223
the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.

816
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,581
They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.

817
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:58,863
I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.

818
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:03,541
Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?

819
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,663
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

820
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,623
What? About me working for the old firm?

821
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,981
Convinced?

822
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,261
You don't fuck about, do you?

823
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:30,183
Jimmy was skint, huh?

824
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:33,666
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

825
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:41,868
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

826
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,026
Really?

827
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,586
Why did you kill Larry?

828
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,110
Funnily enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

829
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:57,061
Jimmy never lik ed Larry.

830
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,501
Look at that wrong 'un waving
his money around. It ain't right.

831
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,865
Hey, I love you, man.

832
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:09,542
He saw the future was drugs
and it needed to be run like a business.

833
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,900
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

834
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:14,578
After that business with Kilburn Jerry...

835
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:18,624
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

836
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,269
...he wanted him gone.

837
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,148
I didn't have any problem doing him.

838
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,466
That's why I did it.

839
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,979
But why did you keep the gun?

840
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,739
Sounds silly now, but it was my favourite.

841
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:44,101
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you've got favourites.

842
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,264
So what's the next move, boss?

843
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,505
Well, I'm going to bed.

844
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:02,385
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

845
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:36,307
Sorry?

846
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:42,866
Sorry, mate, what was that?

847
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:46,107
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week.

848
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:48,983
OK. OK, I'm sorry. I was just saying...

849
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:06,224
So when does the target get here, then?

850
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:09,467
The target? The target's gonna be here
at exactly midday.

851
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:10,898
Where?

852
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,226
- Here, right fucking here.
- Got a photo?

853
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,466
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

854
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,662
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.

855
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,067
I could get the 13.10 home from here.

856
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,828
Let's have a little recce.

857
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,183
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

858
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,984
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

859
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,226
Don't run, whatever you do.

860
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,627
The first five minutes,
nobody'll have a clue what's going on.

861
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,742
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.

862
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,304
So try to stay relaxed.

863
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:50,381
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

864
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:52,581
Or me.

865
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:58,342
Afterwards, take me to the Underground
station. I'll look after myself.

866
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,338
There.

867
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,581
Time?

868
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:11,705
Six minutes to twelve.

869
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,702
I hope he's not gonna be late.

870
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,381
- Maybe he'll be early.
- That'll be nice.

871
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:36,979
Can you see that guy on the left?

872
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:47,025
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

873
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:53,385
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I'm gonna call him.

874
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:56,909
It's up to you. You're the client.

875
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:07,389
- As soon as he answers, he's gone, OK?
- Okey-dokey.

876
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,029
Stand by.

877
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:18,667
Now.

878
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:23,665
Hello, may I help you?

879
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:30,260
Don't move a muscle.

880
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:34,588
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

881
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:39,989
You English, you have no idea
of honour and respect.

882
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:46,140
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duk e.

883
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:49,103
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.

884
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:54,826
Don't piss in my pock et
and tell me it's raining.

885
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:56,702
Now listen for the last time.

886
01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:01,267
- You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!

887
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:05,304
You have one more day.

888
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:12,307
See you tomorrow at dusk by the statue.
Remember, I will be watching you.

889
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,707
What the fuck were you thinking?

890
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,067
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

891
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:32,739
Trevor's gonna go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

892
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,180
- What a fucking mess.
- You've gone mad.

893
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,142
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

894
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,545
You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.

895
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:43,026
If you do it near me,
I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.

896
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:45,901
Stick to your fucking sums.

897
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,139
Listen. Listen to me.

898
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,500
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

899
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:55,020
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

900
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,824
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

901
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:02,069
- I wish.
- Fuck off! It could've been you or Morty.

902
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:08,698
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

903
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,899
What?

904
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:20,144
I should've told you this earlier.

905
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,828
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

906
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:28,979
Paul the boatman was topped last night.
I've got to get on my toes sharpish.

907
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,704
I want Jimmy
brought here right now, yeah?

908
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:36,222
Getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard
to tell Duke those pills were useless,

909
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,580
after sending us over in the first place.

910
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,621
Hang on, you've lost me now.

911
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:45,267
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.

912
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,030
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law.

913
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,141
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

914
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,023
Shut the fuck up!

915
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,503
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

916
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:16,349
You're not in there 'cause I like you.

917
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,020
I'm beginning to feel left out.

918
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:22,663
Why?

919
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:25,384
Freddie Hurst is still in intensive care

920
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:28,900
after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

921
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:31,340
Fucking hell, Duke.

922
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:33,939
For once, you might be of some use.

923
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:53,740
That was Gazza on the phone. It's on.

924
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,704
He'll pick you up at nine in the morning.
Gallows Corner. You know it?

925
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:59,184
Yeah.

926
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:04,862
With Jimmy gone, these pills will make
a nice contribution to my retirement fund,

927
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,664
so don't fuck things up again, OK?

928
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:13,945
If you do, you'll wish this Dragan had
shot you between the eyes, understand?

929
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,226
Best of luck.

930
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,589
Thanks.

931
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,504
Fuck off!

932
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:47,100
Sidney, I've told you,
stop answering my phone, OK?

933
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,948
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

934
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,663
- All right?
- Hello, Sidney.

935
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:31,101
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right. How are you?

936
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,868
I'm all right, mate, yeah.

937
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:05,860
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. 50 pence a pill.

938
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,220
That way, we all come out
with something.

939
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:13,550
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

940
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:17,504
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

941
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:20,622
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from,

942
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:23,025
they'd kill you like you'd take a piss.

943
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,819
Gazza, the Old Bill are outside!

944
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,100
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

945
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:34,060
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

946
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:36,340
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

947
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:40,145
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're gonna get us all shot.

948
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:43,228
Fuck it! Boat!

949
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,266
Stay there!

950
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,028
Fuck!

951
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,068
Come on!

952
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,661
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

953
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,428
Get in.

954
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:27,989
Is this for me?

955
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,427
Yes.

956
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:43,943
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.

957
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,062
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

958
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:50,421
- How do you know?
- I watched.

959
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:53,781
I don't believe this.
Captain's gonna go fucking spare!

960
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:57,187
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

961
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,143
Oh, fucking hell.

962
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,989
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox

963
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:06,341
that his suspect has scarpered
'cause of your blundering.

964
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:08,506
Knobheads. Helmets off.

965
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:19,464
Does this settle things, then?

966
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:41,624
Tango Foxtrot, over.

967
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,298
Delta Uniform...

968
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,822
How did that other errand go?

969
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,908
Success, as far as I could make out.

970
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,619
Where is my fucking prisoner?

971
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:05,708
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

972
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:08,378
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

973
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,979
- Indigo...
- Dingo Bongo.

974
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:14,829
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

975
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:16,429
You can fuck off, then.

976
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,661
So where are the pills, genius?

977
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:23,259
I think this is them now.

978
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:28,659
What the fuck?

979
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:33,700
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

980
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:39,983
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

981
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:44,149
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

982
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:47,387
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

983
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,058
Hello.

984
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:29,583
OK. Yes, I will do. Bye-bye.

985
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:36,939
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

986
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:42,067
Good news.

987
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:45,499
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

988
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,940
Listen, I've got one for you.

989
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:50,539
Irishman caught his son snorting charlie.

990
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,982
He said, " If I catch you doing that again,
I'll rub your fucking nose in it."

991
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:22,348
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

992
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:26,306
Boss wants to see you in his office.

993
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,219
Come in. Sit down.

994
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:44,705
Here you are. Payment.

995
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:00,059
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

996
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:06,300
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

997
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:09,627
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

998
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:13,618
I'm keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

999
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:18,221
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.

1000
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:22,059
The amount of trouble
you've caused the last few days.

1001
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:23,988
Jimmy.

1002
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:26,260
Poor little Jimmy.

1003
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,742
It would be in your interests

1004
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,022
if this thing finishes here, now, today.
Understand?

1005
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:36,898
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are gonna come after you.

1006
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:41,221
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country,

1007
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:44,467
looking for revenge. Look at 'em.

1008
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:48,299
Bunch of under-endowed,
ageing fuck pigs.

1009
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:50,182
Are you enjoying this?

1010
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:53,302
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

1011
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:55,387
You're a bright young man.

1012
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:58,388
This monkey business is in your blood,
under your skin.

1013
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:02,424
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I've every faith in you.

1014
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:09,229
One day, it will be you sitting here telling
some young Turk the facts of life.

1015
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:13,146
And they are, Mr Temple?

1016
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:22,464
You're born, you take shit.

1017
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:25,980
Get out in the world, you take more shit.

1018
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:30,308
Climb a little higher, you take less shit.

1019
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:33,183
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere,

1020
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,699
and you've forgotten what shit
even looks like.

1021
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,705
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

1022
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:59,862
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

1023
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:03,149
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

1024
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:06,907
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

1025
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:08,338
Goodnight.

1026
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:44,539
If you're gonna hang around in this game,
that's where you've got to be.

1027
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:48,709
In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work,

1028
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:50,980
while you deliver the suspect lecture

1029
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,421
to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.

1030
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:59,588
The art of good business
is being a good middleman.

1031
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:03,988
Putting people together. I'll always
thank Eddie for telling me that.

1032
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:08,263
It's all about honour and respect.

1033
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:12,346
This is the end, Mr Duke, as I told you.

1034
01:33:54,830 --> 01:34:00,382
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

1035
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:04,378
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

1036
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:08,981
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

1037
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:12,660
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

1038
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:17,944
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

1039
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,069
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1040
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:24,619
Did I really think Eddie was gonna
give me three million for those pills?

1041
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,866
Did I fuck.

1042
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:31,029
But suddenly there was a v oid
where once there was Jimmy Price.

1043
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:35,621
And after a couple of days, Eddie's little
getting-in-and-getting-out speech

1044
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:38,788
started to mak e sense.

1045
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:07,426
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1046
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:10,224
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

1047
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:19,027
The king is dead.

1048
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:21,582
Long live the king.

1049
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:28,062
Well, I'm honoured.

1050
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:33,381
But for me this is all over. I'm getting out.

1051
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:35,740
What was true then is true now.

1052
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:39,781
Have a plan. Stick to it.

1053
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:42,424
So I'm sure you must have
lots to discuss,

1054
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,985
but I have no business being here.

1055
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:49,140
