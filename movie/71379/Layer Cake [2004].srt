00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:20,993
When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.

2
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:25,870
It was all just cops and robbers.

3
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:40,025
Fucking get down! Get down now!

4
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:42,305
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

5
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:44,267
But it wasn't for me.

6
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,585
Then came the Summer of Love.

7
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:51,867
Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene.

8
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:05,031
There were villains locked away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand,

9
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:07,795
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months

10
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:11,590
for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.

11
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:15,390
I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.

12
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:20,784
Drugs changed everything.

13
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:34,063
Always remember that one day all
this drug monkey-business will be legal.

14
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:37,347
They won't leave it to people like me
when they figure out

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:43,107
how much money there is to be made -
not millions, fucking billions.

16
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:47,786
Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.

17
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,828
Good times today, stupor tomorrow.

18
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:03,828
But this is now.

19
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:07,823
So, until prohibition ends,
make hay while the sun shines.

20
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,830
I am not against it.

21
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,823
I am a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.

22
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:24,745
Ten years ago, Charlie was for pop stars
or a celebrity's birthday bash.

23
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:28,834
It was demonized by Daily Mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars.

24
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:33,148
Now they're my biggest clients.

25
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:38,946
This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge
in Industrial Chemistry.

26
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:41,828
Well, he's got to pay off
his student loan somehow.

27
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,750
Today, I only deal in kilos.

28
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,547
Depending which tariff you use,

29
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:53,225
that will cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison,

30
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,471
which is more time than a rapist.

31
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,146
C'est la vie.

32
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:02,746
It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.

33
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,786
Always work in a small team.

34
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:09,546
Keep a very low profile. Only deal with
people who come recommended.

35
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,427
It's like selling anything -

36
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:13,910
washing machines,
hand-made shoes, blow-jobs.

37
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:17,824
As long as you don't take the piss,
people will always come back for more.

38
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:22,153
That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that makes two kilos into three,

39
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:25,028
but never be too greedy.

40
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:34,147
Know and respect your enemy.

41
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:38,712
It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.

42
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,865
And avoid like the fucking plague

43
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,908
loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters,

44
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,629
in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.

45
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:56,431
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, this is Duke.

46
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:59,911
Everything's sweet. When can we meet?

47
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,154
They don't mean to fuck up. They just do.

48
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:16,992
Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.

49
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,713
They are guaranteed to bring you trouble.

50
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,065
As do guns.

51
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,470
I hate guns. And violence.

52
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:28,872
But as some Roman general once said,

53
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:32,112
"If you seek peace, plan for war.”

54
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:36,103
Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.

55
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:40,433
Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did ten years inside.

56
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:46,468
He's my bridge to the criminal world, and
he ensures that the traffic is one way.

57
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:49,754
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe...dorfe.

58
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:53,391
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

59
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:56,234
- Get in the car. I am sure it's that way.
- Move up.

60
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:59,233
- I bet you it's that way.
- We have already been that way.

61
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:03,348
Yeah, but we're going to go that way again.
Give us the map.

62
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:06,943
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

63
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,544
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

64
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:13,430
- All day you have been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

65
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:16,354
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

66
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:19,715
Morty.

67
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,674
Terence.

68
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,103
Clarkie.

69
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:29,949
Very, very important.:
pay your supplier prompt.

70
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:34,273
In our case, that's Mr. Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.

71
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:38,354
Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.

72
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:42,594
You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.

73
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,152
Where the fuck is Gene?

74
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:48,791
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

75
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,872
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

76
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,303
Shut the fuck up.

77
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:57,227
Patience.

78
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,995
Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.

79
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:02,151
Been with him since way back.

80
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,994
All the drugs and cash go through Gene.

81
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:07,470
Jimmy trusts him with his life.

82
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:17,429
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

83
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:22,273
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

84
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:26,946
Why does everybody assume there's a
problem, just because he wants a word?

85
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:31,467
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

86
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,506
See you at Stoke Park at one.

87
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:40,114
This is just so beautiful.

88
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,590
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

89
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:45,707
Paul and the tide ain't going to wait.

90
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:59,067
Everyone likes to walk
through a door marked "Private".

91
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:02,665
Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.

92
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,435
I own a share
in a very successful letting agency.

93
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:09,674
It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.

94
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:16,665
Whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks,

95
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,663
now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.

96
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,673
That's a job for Mr. Singh.
He does my laundry.

97
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,264
And in a week,
it will be ready for collection,

98
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:31,629
in the form of a nice, clean cheque
for a round million.

99
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,946
The business is on the up and up.

100
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,147
But I have always said,
have a plan and stick to it.

101
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,266
Quit while you're ahead.

102
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,308
So barring any fuck-ups,
I am leaving it all behind.

103
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,506
No, we got the parcel.

104
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,910
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

105
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,630
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

106
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:58,067
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

107
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:01,392
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

108
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:05,383
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.
You're being paid to get my cargo home.

109
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:10,508
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

110
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:15,947
Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.

111
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:21,513
I will treat tomorrow's lunch like a Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.

112
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:23,990
And then leave quietly forever.

113
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,386
This is pure class.

114
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:34,945
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

115
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,350
Mr. Price is in the Oval Room.

116
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:55,584
- Your guests, Mr. Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

117
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,593
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

118
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:01,787
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

119
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,555
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

120
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,507
We all have to do our bit.

121
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:09,513
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

122
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:13,310
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

123
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,267
Let's eat.

124
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:22,789
Right.

125
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:26,305
We have got to test the snap-crackle-and-pop
factor on these babies.

126
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,348
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching them.

127
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:31,750
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

128
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:38,267
- Brian.
- What?

129
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:42,184
Sit down, mate. Got a little treat for you.

130
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,026
Help yourself.

131
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,786
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

132
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,306
What do you want, son?

133
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:21,745
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

134
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:27,711
A shot at the title? A seat by the band?

135
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:36,548
Well, I don't know, Mr. Price.
That's a very expansive question.

136
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,144
Right, expansive. Good answer.

137
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:42,552
Years ago, people would have
thought you were a homosexual,

138
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:44,473
using a word like "expansive" .

139
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:47,189
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

140
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:50,273
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

141
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,591
No, I didn't think you were.

142
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,787
No harm in it, I suppose. Times change.

143
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:01,594
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

144
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:09,033
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

145
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,705
Anyway, I will get to the point.
I need a favor.

146
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:16,066
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

147
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:19,472
Not a two-a-penny loud-mouth.
Too many grasses around.

148
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:24,784
- It would be a pleasure, Mr. Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

149
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:29,785
Now, this favor. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

150
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:34,227
Like a blood-brother.
We were at school together.

151
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:36,232
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

152
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:39,268
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

153
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:45,584
I will give you a clue. Eddie Temple.
Does that name mean anything to you?

154
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,389
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

155
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,426
Charlie, bless her.

156
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:54,264
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

157
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,033
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

158
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:01,387
Or to give her her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

159
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,031
But she ain't behaving like a lady.

160
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:07,068
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong 'un.

161
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:11,029
This is where you come in, right?
You're going to find her.

162
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:15,473
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

163
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,791
Well, you should get a private detective.

164
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:23,991
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

165
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:28,188
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

166
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:29,623
Rehab.

167
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:35,114
She got loved up in there with some
fucking low-life crackhead called Kinky.

168
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,271
I reckon they have gone back to London.

169
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,227
I wouldn't know where to begin.

170
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:43,223
Now and then we're asked
to do something beyond the call of duty.

171
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:49,704
It's called sacrifice, son.
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

172
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:54,073
- I will do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

173
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,709
Keep Mr. McGuire posted.

174
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,467
I have also got a little business
more in your usual line.

175
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,347
Gene will fill you in.

176
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,546
Everything was to your satisfaction?

177
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:11,269
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

178
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:19,268
" Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

179
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,592
" Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done."

180
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,992
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

181
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:32,225
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

182
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,504
I will see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

183
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:44,073
Tell you about that bit of business.
I have set up a meet for five with the Duke.

184
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:54,866
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

185
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,191
These are super Es. We will make millions!

186
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:00,944
I don't care. This is my boat-yard.

187
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:04,227
I want those pills
and that fucking idiot out of here now.

188
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,233
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

189
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:10,745
I have got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You will be in your whack.

190
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,788
Here, chill. Have a pill.

191
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:18,823
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

192
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,503
Yeah, why are we dealing with this joker?

193
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:25,788
He's a fucking maniac, a relic,
a throw-back, belongs to the Dark Ages.

194
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:28,065
Will you just shut the fuck up?

195
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,233
We're dealing with him because
he has 1 million Ecstasy pills

196
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:34,108
of very high levels of MDMA, OK?

197
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:36,385
One million?

198
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:39,632
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

199
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,746
Jimmy wants 50% netto.

200
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:44,628
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger, this lot.

201
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:47,827
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

202
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:51,072
Calm down. You will feel better
once you have got your money.

203
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:54,631
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

204
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,187
Come on.

205
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:04,592
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, OK?

206
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:06,433
Who? Me?

207
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:10,514
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I am some kind of mug.

208
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:15,311
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

209
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,585
You want to know
how much they're worth.

210
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:19,706
Yes! Fucking! Please!

211
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:23,351
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market,

212
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:27,230
don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

213
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,663
They're not.

214
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,706
We have got to find a buyer.

215
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:35,272
They have got to split them into parcels.
They have got to find these people.

216
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,228
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

217
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:43,111
Then you have got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

218
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:47,433
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

219
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:50,593
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

220
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,833
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

221
00:16:57,035 --> 00:17:02,234
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth five million easy.

222
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,665
- £5 each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

223
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,627
It doesn't work like that!

224
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:11,306
Don't keep fucking saying that to me!

225
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:15,144
I have got some samples.
I will stay in touch through Gene, OK?

226
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:20,427
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

227
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:24,025
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?

228
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,751
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

229
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,515
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

230
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,512
We know someone up North who will buy.

231
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:37,424
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

232
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:43,947
What's really bothering me
is what color to get the Aston.

233
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:47,227
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

234
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:49,027
- Green?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,227
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

236
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:53,993
Black. Yeah, black.

237
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:56,584
Black's the color for a hearse or a taxi.

238
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:59,992
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

239
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:03,153
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

240
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:07,030
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

241
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:09,191
Hugo, follow me.

242
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:11,784
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

243
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:14,190
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

244
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:20,910
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

245
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,504
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

246
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:26,149
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

247
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,233
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

248
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:32,268
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

249
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,909
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

250
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:39,427
- How quickly?
- 20 grand quickly.

251
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,591
You have got our attention.

252
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:50,744
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

253
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,185
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

254
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:57,354
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

255
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:01,670
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.

256
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,831
Chuck them a few quid, they will cough.

257
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,592
- Is there anything else?
- No.

258
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,706
We must get back to work, old boy.

259
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,193
Look...

260
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:17,832
All right, mate. I am the Duke's nephew.

261
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,832
Remember me? Sidney.

262
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,710
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are you?
I am just off. Have a nice night.

263
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:25,633
How you doing?
What you doing here?

264
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:28,793
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

265
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:31,509
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

266
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:38,270
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

267
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:42,024
He's a good mate of my uncle's, the Duke.
He was just going.

268
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:45,910
Yeah, well stick around and have a drink
before you do, yeah?

269
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:53,064
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

270
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:00,506
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

271
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,991
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

272
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:08,825
If you want anything, just tell me,
because I got them straightened out in here.

273
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,947
If you want any running about,
I am your man...

274
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:41,064
- Line?
- What?

275
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,709
I said do you want a line?

276
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:47,464
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

277
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,912
Lovely, isn't she? Isn't she a darling?

278
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,673
Isn't she?

279
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,514
Siddy, baby, I could do with a livener.

280
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:09,386
Sidney, it's been great. I will see 
you, man. Thanks for the champagne.

281
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:11,551
All right.

282
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:30,588
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr. Lucky.

283
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:34,185
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

284
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:38,991
- Everyone wants a slice as well.
- Same wherever you go. Greedy people.

285
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:41,834
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

286
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:45,425
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

287
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:47,751
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

288
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:52,107
Well, not you lot, but...

289
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:54,783
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

290
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:57,714
No offence, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

291
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:02,113
You really do surprise me,
do you know that?

292
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:04,510
Do you know something we don't?

293
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:09,835
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

294
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:14,586
Because I am not a fucking prick.

295
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:19,505
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it, Shanks. They really don't know.

296
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:24,071
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

297
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:26,072
Last weekend, right?

298
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:29,551
The whole place is alight with a rumor

299
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:32,792
about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end,

300
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:37,671
run by this joker called the Duke...

301
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:43,586
- Gazza, go and find them fucking pills.
- All right. Come on. Have a look in here.

302
00:22:45,675 --> 00:22:49,224
They skanked this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.

303
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,269
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

304
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:54,794
Shut up.

305
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:57,031
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

306
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:59,066
Shut up or I will be the last.

307
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:03,589
Fuck me.

308
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:06,434
They got lucky.
He'd just knocked up a massive batch.

309
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,663
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

310
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,989
Stay down there. Yes?

311
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,545
You watch them.

312
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:27,590
- That looks very heavy for you, darling.
- Fuck off.

313
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:34,034
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

314
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:38,467
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl. Shut up!

315
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,744
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

316
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:47,593
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

317
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:49,865
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

318
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,184
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

319
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:03,474
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

320
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:08,191
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

321
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,954
This will not be the end of this,
Mr. Duke, believe me.

322
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:19,943
Gazza, go and load them pills.

323
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:24,194
But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.

324
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:28,388
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

325
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:33,350
They're wanted by the United
fucking Nations. Think about that.

326
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,034
Let's get this clear.

327
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:40,628
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

328
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:43,827
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

329
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:46,629
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

330
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:51,272
Word on the street is they have unleashed
their top boy. His name is...

331
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:03,627
His party piece, right,

332
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,669
is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

333
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:14,348
It's all about honor and respect with
these head-banging nationalist outfits.

334
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:19,265
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

335
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:23,309
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

336
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:26,313
OK, we accept that.

337
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:30,986
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

338
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:35,429
Bad.

339
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:40,428
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

340
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:45,425
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

341
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:53,953
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.
Me and him need to have a little think.

342
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:57,625
Don't think too long. Someone's
going to make a killing on these pills.

343
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:02,147
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

344
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:09,704
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

345
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:13,749
I told you he was trouble. But he ain't
going to drag me down with him.

346
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:17,072
Try Gene again. What a fucking show-up!

347
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:20,474
- He's not answering, Mort.
- OK.

348
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:24,425
Try Jimmy at home.

349
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,591
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

350
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:33,631
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boat-yard.

351
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:39,228
- Somebody's about to get a fucking slap.
- Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

352
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,468
Paul?

353
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:32,584
What a way to go. An iron burning a hole
in your chest until your heart boils.

354
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:35,753
Paulie would have told him anything, then,
wouldn't he?

355
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:42,834
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

356
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:50,067
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make some
phone calls, but really quietly.

357
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:52,948
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

358
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,715
We're going to need an insurance policy.

359
00:27:55,715 --> 00:28:00,067
What's the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, you prick!

360
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:05,110
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!

361
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:11,068
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills ain't worth shit?

362
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:13,231
You don't know
the problems you have caused.

363
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:17,713
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes,

364
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:19,587
to find that bitch Charlie.

365
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:22,434
I fucking told you to do it!

366
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:27,025
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

367
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:29,544
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

368
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:30,983
I don't give a fuck!

369
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:01,992
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

370
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:05,312
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

371
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:08,393
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

372
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:12,031
No, I haven't. He's in here.

373
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:22,195
Kinky.

374
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:26,754
I still want to be paid.

375
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:39,515
So, if I am correct, you three gearheads
are going to be clucking very soon.

376
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:43,344
In fact, you're going to be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

377
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:46,023
But I am prepared to do you a favor.

378
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:48,874
We can do this one of two ways.

379
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,430
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you will prefer.

380
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:55,944
Because the other way
is my friend takes you

381
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:58,225
and puts your head
through the window!

382
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:03,110
Right, so, was Charlie here with Kinky?

383
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:07,228
Yeah, she was here for a couple of days.
Kinky turned up with five grand.

384
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:10,268
- Who's giving Kinky five grand?
- We don't know.

385
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,592
They kept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy

386
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:17,151
"taking the five grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.

387
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,027
Where is she now?

388
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,988
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

389
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,904
The other night, I hears this noise.
I am looking out there. It's dark.

390
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:30,631
But I sees this geezer all in black.
It's like something out of a kung-fu film.

391
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:35,226
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

392
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:39,189
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

393
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:43,354
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

394
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:46,023
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

395
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:48,590
You telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

396
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:51,309
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

397
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,471
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

398
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:56,587
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

399
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,945
Shut the fuck up!

400
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:01,111
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

401
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:02,589
Get the fucking money!

402
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:05,389
Morty! Morty!

403
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,825
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

404
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,913
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

405
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:13,993
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I will double your money.

406
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:18,108
- All right. And ten G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

407
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,311
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

408
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:28,826
Hello. Ambulance, please.

409
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:32,311
185 Kirby House, Kings Cross.

410
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:37,111
There's a dead boy. The door's open.

411
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:40,387
My name...?

412
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:42,153
185 Kirby House.

413
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:54,748
I am not happy.

414
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:04,826
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out or I will sort you out.

415
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:07,310
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

416
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:14,430
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off down to Brighton.

417
00:32:14,635 --> 00:32:16,785
Cody's going to find her.

418
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:24,906
Look, I am going to freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

419
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,114
Morty?

420
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:33,793
Is that you?

421
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,145
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

422
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:42,584
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

423
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,153
Hello, Freddie.

424
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:03,165
So...

425
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,999
......Mr. Mortimer.

426
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:14,792
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us a few quid,
for old times' sake?

427
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,825
You look well flush, bruv.

428
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:22,985
Fuck me, he's loaded.

429
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:30,106
Here, couldn't make it five, could you...

430
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:32,632
...mate?

431
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:35,269
- Let's make it ten.
- Yeah.

432
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,431
Ten's...

433
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:40,194
...a nice...

434
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,267
...round number.

435
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:45,554
What's the matter?

436
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:06,269
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

437
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,030
Going off? Or do you need a red light?

438
00:34:18,195 --> 00:34:20,504
Stop, Morty. Enough. He's had enough.

439
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:24,833
- I will tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

440
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:34,747
But let's forget about all that.

441
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:37,185
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr. Hurst.

442
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:03,793
What the fuck?

443
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:07,783
I am sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

444
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,667
- It's me.
- Hey.

445
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,070
Come on up.
I will leave the door open.

446
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,427
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

447
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:56,468
Have you eaten?
I will have a Chinky sent up.

448
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:58,154
No, I am fine, thank you.

449
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,227
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

450
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:05,223
He used to run with me, Morty and Jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm.

451
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:08,825
In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.

452
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:11,424
Yeah. Got shot, didn't he? Bit of a lunatic.

453
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:14,513
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.

454
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,671
Always doing loads of drugs.

455
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:21,508
- Not worried about keeping a low profile.
- I love you.

456
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,865
Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.

457
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:26,384
No fucking problem. Boys will be boys.

458
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:30,349
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...

459
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:33,147
...shoots himself stone dead.

460
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,866
This is a bit of a dilemma.

461
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:39,704
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

462
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,713
Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty,

463
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:45,110
actually volunteered
to dispose of the body.

464
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:48,307
No head. But things went a bit wrong.

465
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:53,825
The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.

466
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:57,471
The total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights

467
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,269
in a drunken, drug-induced stupor.

468
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:05,310
Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.

469
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,154
Being black
was even worse than being Irish.

470
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:10,266
They threw the book at Morty.

471
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,784
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

472
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:16,112
Morty did ten years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

473
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:18,431
But he kept his mouth shut.

474
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:22,628
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

475
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:27,306
All because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic.

476
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:31,747
- Who?
- But you, you fuck!

477
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:33,274
Larry.

478
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:37,229
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

479
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:40,745
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

480
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:43,150
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

481
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:45,266
Probably.

482
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:50,265
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

483
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:54,032
Not for me.

484
00:37:56,515 --> 00:37:59,825
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

485
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:03,311
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage.

486
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:08,314
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

487
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:11,712
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty

488
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:16,670
or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

489
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:23,950
You know, I will have one of those.

490
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:33,468
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

491
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:35,984
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

492
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:40,427
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

493
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:45,231
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs baby-sit these.

494
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:51,547
Gene, what the fuck
am I going to do about these Serbs?

495
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:58,028
Come here. I have something for you.

496
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:08,793
- You're going to need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

497
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:14,431
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

498
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:17,274
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

499
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:20,547
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

500
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:23,315
Hey, point it upwards.

501
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,430
Oh, for fuck's sake.

502
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:32,029
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

503
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,304
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

504
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:54,666
I can and I do.

505
00:39:54,875 --> 00:40:00,313
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

506
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:06,070
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task

507
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:09,745
so the rest of the mind can find peace.

508
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:16,189
And you find peace with guns.

509
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,351
Well, on occasion. It has been known.

510
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:26,270
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

511
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:33,349
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never, ever tell a living soul.

512
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:55,026
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.

513
00:40:58,115 --> 00:41:00,185
How did you get this number?

514
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:04,513
Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.

515
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:08,185
I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer,

516
00:41:08,395 --> 00:41:11,990
and you're the person I should talk to
about the return of this cargo,

517
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:14,709
stolen by your associate, the Duke.

518
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:18,749
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

519
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:23,790
Mr. Duke came to Amsterdam,
used your name, said he worked for you.

520
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:30,185
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...

521
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:38,152
I have got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

522
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:41,904
I will squeeze some orange juice
and we will talk about this like adults.

523
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:45,266
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.

524
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:47,193
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

525
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:48,953
Well, fuck off, then.

526
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:02,667
Duke's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.

527
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,992
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

528
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:09,471
Calm down, Gazza.
I am sure Duke's just fine.

529
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:13,429
Well, you have got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I am sending them back, OK?

530
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:16,547
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

531
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:20,430
It ain't worth the grief. We have gone
underground, off the radar.

532
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,944
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

533
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:39,787
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

534
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:44,591
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

535
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:48,834
Between you and that gobshite Duke,
he's promised Jimmy a bumper pay-day.

536
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:51,503
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

537
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:53,546
He put yous together.

538
00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:56,588
You and Duke. That's his job.

539
00:42:56,795 --> 00:43:02,267
If you two can't make music, he's going to
want his whack out either way.

540
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:11,347
That's business.

541
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:21,389
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

542
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:24,234
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

543
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,347
Well, I am beginning to regret it now.

544
00:43:28,795 --> 00:43:31,832
We have got to find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

545
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:34,549
We can't rely
on these monkeys to call Gene.

546
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:37,223
We have looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

547
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:39,505
You can't find any of his firm?

548
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:44,550
Maybe this Dragan geezer's already found
the Duke and done the business.

549
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,827
Yeah, well, there is someone I can call.
Keep looking.

550
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:50,913
Wait. You're going to leave it to us?

551
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:54,551
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

552
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:59,510
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

553
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:09,753
- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.

554
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:13,231
- What took you so long to call?
- I have been busy.

555
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:16,154
- You sound sleepy. You just woken up?
- Not long ago.

556
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:20,951
- So when am I going to see you?
- What are you doing now?

557
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:25,751
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

558
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,105
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.

559
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:41,233
- You lying there naked?
- I have got a little T-shirt on. But that's all.

560
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:43,505
Here, wait, listen to this.

561
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,227
What's that?

562
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,074
I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.

563
00:44:51,715 --> 00:44:55,424
Did you like it?
My, oh my, it's fresh this morning.

564
00:44:55,635 --> 00:45:01,870
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

565
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:07,149
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?
I will book a table for lunch.

566
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:08,583
St Martin's Hotel.

567
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:11,593
Don't worry about a table.
We will have room service.

568
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,626
- Yeah, OK.
- One hour.

569
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:50,511
Hang on.

570
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:26,310
Oh, shit.

571
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:32,027
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

572
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:41,706
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

573
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:43,394
Not round here, I hope.

574
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:47,747
No, over by Greenwich market.
So you can relax. It's just the two of us.

575
00:46:56,675 --> 00:47:00,384
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

576
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:04,668
Stay put.

577
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:28,473
Hello, it's me. It's me. Shut up and listen.

578
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:32,714
Sidney, Duke's nephew is working down
by Greenwich Market. Go and look.

579
00:47:34,475 --> 00:47:37,626
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

580
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:40,143
OK.

581
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:49,071
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

582
00:48:15,315 --> 00:48:19,752
One moment, Mr. Troop. I want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself.

583
00:48:32,715 --> 00:48:35,388
I am Jimmy's old colleague, Eddie Temple.

584
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:39,269
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

585
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:41,750
Hunt her down like some lost mongrel.

586
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:46,229
He said you asked for his help.

587
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:52,510
Mr. Troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat.

588
00:48:52,715 --> 00:48:58,312
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

589
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,233
You'd join that shit, Kinky,

590
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:03,552
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over.

591
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:09,227
The audacity. How fucking dare you?

592
00:49:09,435 --> 00:49:12,871
I have known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

593
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,669
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

594
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:20,184
Do you know what a remora fish is?

595
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:24,304
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

596
00:49:25,555 --> 00:49:29,707
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

597
00:49:29,915 --> 00:49:33,908
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

598
00:49:34,115 --> 00:49:37,266
But I have checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

599
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,626
But you keep very, very bad company.

600
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:46,950
You know, I host
a charity golf tournament every year.

601
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:50,306
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

602
00:49:50,515 --> 00:49:55,748
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious.

603
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:58,628
Drinks are on me. Drinks for everyone.

604
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:01,588
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

605
00:50:01,795 --> 00:50:07,392
But I have come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

606
00:50:07,595 --> 00:50:10,632
Jimmy, as usual
on the look out for tidbits,

607
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:14,908
has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.

608
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,470
They're trawling the West
for investments.

609
00:50:17,675 --> 00:50:22,590
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

610
00:50:22,795 --> 00:50:26,504
They have sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.

611
00:50:26,715 --> 00:50:31,505
Profits, shares, long-term investments,
short-term investments.

612
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:37,745
They have even made him an honorary
citizen. Even made him one of the tribe.

613
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:41,914
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears,

614
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:44,345
was that the hard-line
communist insurgents

615
00:50:44,555 --> 00:50:48,230
who control the country
outside the mining areas...

616
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:51,029
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.

617
00:50:51,235 --> 00:50:53,032
The communists have broken through.

618
00:50:53,235 --> 00:50:55,385
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

619
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,426
What the fuck are you on about?

620
00:50:57,635 --> 00:50:59,671
I got word they were planning a push.

621
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,945
The final coup de grâce. I told Jimmy.

622
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:03,907
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

623
00:51:04,115 --> 00:51:07,630
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

624
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:11,430
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

625
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:15,753
Now, I explained that wasn't possible.
We thought we'd bought a government.

626
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:18,515
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

627
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:20,228
You win some, you lose some.

628
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,553
How much are we talking?

629
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:24,473
It's only a cheeky half-mill, Jim.

630
00:51:24,675 --> 00:51:28,190
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

631
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:31,228
- 13.
- 13 what?

632
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:37,510
- 13 million pounds. I am fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

633
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:45,269
13 million pounds!
How could you be so fucking stupid?

634
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:48,114
You have been right grafted,
royally turned over.

635
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:51,830
- Like some Yank buying London Bridge.
- Don't talk to me like that.

636
00:51:52,035 --> 00:51:53,866
He accused me of instigating it.

637
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:56,430
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

638
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:58,466
Are you fucking demented?

639
00:51:58,675 --> 00:52:00,825
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister,

640
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,744
still parked up
in La Maison Grande, still eating well.

641
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:09,710
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

642
00:52:09,915 --> 00:52:13,510
Jimmy thought he'd keep Charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money.

643
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:18,584
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

644
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:20,023
I am sorry, what?

645
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:23,147
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

646
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:25,550
If I find you trying to find her,

647
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:27,473
I do his dirty work.

648
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:32,584
- I am still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

649
00:52:33,675 --> 00:52:37,554
I have found out something
very interesting about Jimmy,

650
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,427
something I have long suspected.

651
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:45,948
But I will let Jimmy explain.

652
00:52:46,155 --> 00:52:48,623
You follow me.

653
00:53:35,435 --> 00:53:37,073
You have no doubt suffered Jimmy's

654
00:53:37,275 --> 00:53:40,187
" CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

655
00:53:40,395 --> 00:53:42,272
The other chap's Albert Carter.

656
00:53:42,475 --> 00:53:44,943
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood.

657
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:49,546
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax and enjoy.

658
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,269
It ain't like your lot in the old days.

659
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:55,148
- They have all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.

660
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:59,064
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

661
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:04,429
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- It's the going rate, Jim.

662
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:07,954
Ten K. Hardly seems worth the bother.

663
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:13,354
Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.

664
00:54:16,355 --> 00:54:19,552
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

665
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:24,306
What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...

666
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:26,631
...is too loyal for his own good.

667
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:31,593
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

668
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:34,946
- because it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

669
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:37,233
Mr. Troop made it for me.

670
00:54:38,395 --> 00:54:42,627
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

671
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:46,384
Don't you want to hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

672
00:54:46,595 --> 00:54:51,430
I have got one for you.
Plucked and ready for the pot.

673
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:55,186
- Just give us a name and he's gone.
- In time.

674
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,989
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.

675
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:01,870
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?

676
00:55:02,075 --> 00:55:06,114
Reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement.

677
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:08,875
I want him away for 12.

678
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:12,272
If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.

679
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,194
- I will put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

680
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,114
He's got a few quid .
He will come in handy.

681
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,354
I set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place.

682
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:24,864
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?

683
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:29,273
"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr. Price. "

684
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:34,071
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

685
00:55:34,275 --> 00:55:37,426
You'd no idea what Jimmy was up to?

686
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:40,024
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

687
00:55:40,235 --> 00:55:44,387
I would have thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

688
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:47,905
- Can I have that?
- Mr. Troop.

689
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:52,506
Thank you.

690
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:58,543
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

691
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,145
I will keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

692
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:05,427
Opera tonight. The Damnation of Faust.

693
00:56:05,635 --> 00:56:10,231
Man sells his soul to the devil. All ends
in tears. These arrangements usually do.

694
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:22,669
One more thing, young man.

695
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:26,550
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

696
00:56:26,755 --> 00:56:28,711
Bye-bye.

697
00:56:57,035 --> 00:56:58,627
Fuck!

698
01:02:10,715 --> 01:02:13,548
- I have got him.
- Got who?

699
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:16,709
Sidney, remember? Yellow Range Rover?

700
01:02:16,915 --> 01:02:19,668
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

701
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:22,594
Good. Tell Morty.

702
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:26,430
- So what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

703
01:03:40,035 --> 01:03:43,266
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.

704
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:46,592
If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.

705
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:51,744
Dragan, I have been doing some checking.

706
01:03:51,955 --> 01:03:54,025
- I have found out who you represent.
- Good.

707
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:56,829
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

708
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:58,627
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...

709
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,590
- I'd rather meet you in a public place.
- You have nothing to fear.

710
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:08,664
- I am a reasonable man.
- That's not what I have heard.

711
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:11,105
I will meet you at...

712
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,911
I will meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

713
01:04:17,115 --> 01:04:19,834
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.

714
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:23,584
- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.

715
01:04:24,435 --> 01:04:26,710
I will be there.

716
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:33,509
That's rude, Mr. Dragan.

717
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,792
It's Conditions Red down there.

718
01:04:46,995 --> 01:04:50,829
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lock-up.

719
01:04:51,035 --> 01:04:53,993
Have a look at the geezer at the front,
on the door.

720
01:04:56,955 --> 01:04:59,753
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

721
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:01,752
What about the blokes in red?

722
01:05:01,955 --> 01:05:04,264
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

723
01:05:04,475 --> 01:05:07,228
The lorries come in one color,
go out another.

724
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:09,585
But they're nothing to do with the Duke.

725
01:05:09,795 --> 01:05:12,229
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

726
01:05:13,475 --> 01:05:16,785
It doesn't matter. I have got work to do.

727
01:05:16,995 --> 01:05:20,112
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

728
01:05:20,315 --> 01:05:23,387
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean " night"?

729
01:05:23,595 --> 01:05:27,190
- I have been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

730
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:52,313
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

731
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:56,303
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

732
01:05:56,515 --> 01:06:00,474
I am in the best of health, Mr. Temple.
Thank you for asking.

733
01:06:01,315 --> 01:06:03,545
- How are you keeping?
- I am very well.

734
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:07,031
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.

735
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:10,147
No wonder it took him 60 years to write it.

736
01:06:10,355 --> 01:06:12,266
How's the family?

737
01:06:12,475 --> 01:06:14,352
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

738
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:17,433
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

739
01:06:17,635 --> 01:06:19,830
Being a clever bastard, are we?

740
01:06:20,035 --> 01:06:23,789
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I am not.

741
01:06:23,995 --> 01:06:27,544
Then we will have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

742
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:36,508
I have been thinking, after
our chat the other day.

743
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:40,025
Your pills. How much for the lot?

744
01:06:42,115 --> 01:06:44,151
No, I have already got a buyer.

745
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:47,506
Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.

746
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:49,990
I told you, lah. I am still thinking.

747
01:06:50,195 --> 01:06:53,346
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

748
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:56,194
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

749
01:06:56,395 --> 01:06:58,511
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

750
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,467
They have got history.

751
01:07:01,675 --> 01:07:03,950
Bad juju.

752
01:07:04,155 --> 01:07:08,148
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

753
01:07:08,355 --> 01:07:13,110
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely not...

754
01:07:13,315 --> 01:07:18,343
I did you a big fucking favor
letting you know about Jimmy.

755
01:07:18,555 --> 01:07:20,864
I think you owe me.

756
01:07:22,595 --> 01:07:25,871
2½ million in sterling and euros,
high-denomination used notes.

757
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:30,387
So if I gave you three million,
that would keep everyone happy.

758
01:07:30,595 --> 01:07:32,392
Let me state my position.

759
01:07:33,475 --> 01:07:35,830
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

760
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:39,266
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

761
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:41,591
But I will tell you,

762
01:07:41,795 --> 01:07:46,869
I will be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell them to me.

763
01:07:47,075 --> 01:07:49,145
You understand?

764
01:07:53,755 --> 01:07:56,747
OK, Mr. Temple. Three million. Done.

765
01:07:58,035 --> 01:08:01,914
- My buyer's not going to be happy, though.
- Fuck him. He will get over it.

766
01:08:10,675 --> 01:08:13,109
I am going to need some help.

767
01:08:14,155 --> 01:08:18,034
Someone who can eliminate the problem.
Someone who's a bit handy.

768
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,988
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

769
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:25,670
Mr. Lucky does a drop of freelance work.

770
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:29,911
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

771
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:34,145
You tell him when,
and he will come down on the train.

772
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,231
Thanks, Trev.

773
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,433
Excuse me.

774
01:08:44,835 --> 01:08:46,063
Mr. Temple.

775
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:50,789
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

776
01:08:50,995 --> 01:08:53,429
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

777
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:56,069
Tuesday? I am paying
over the odds, remember?

778
01:08:56,275 --> 01:08:59,585
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

779
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,583
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

780
01:09:15,795 --> 01:09:19,708
Yeah, everything's under control.

781
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:26,710
- Cody's been chasing his ten grand.
- Yeah. I will call him later.

782
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:34,583
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

783
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,274
Oh, yeah? What's that?

784
01:09:36,995 --> 01:09:39,350
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

785
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:42,991
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

786
01:09:44,955 --> 01:09:47,788
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

787
01:09:47,995 --> 01:09:50,873
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

788
01:09:51,075 --> 01:09:54,511
- Open this fucking door!
- Why?

789
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:57,105
Open this fucking door!

790
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:05,274
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

791
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:10,708
Listen to me, Morty. I got a call 
from a cozzer we have got bent.

792
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,224
They found Jimmy's body last night.

793
01:10:13,435 --> 01:10:16,507
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

794
01:10:16,715 --> 01:10:18,945
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

795
01:10:19,155 --> 01:10:21,828
All right, look. Here. We will see.

796
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:23,627
Read it. Read it out loud.

797
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:27,748
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

798
01:10:27,955 --> 01:10:30,264
Read the fucking ballistics report.

799
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:34,309
" Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

800
01:10:34,515 --> 01:10:36,187
"One recovered cartridge casing."

801
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:40,434
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

802
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:42,591
" ...consistent with weapon used

803
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:48,153
" in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower a.k.a. Crazy Larry Flynn."

804
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:52,985
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must have killed Jimmy.

805
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:57,188
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

806
01:10:57,395 --> 01:10:59,750
The one he stole from my flat.

807
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:04,506
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

808
01:11:04,715 --> 01:11:08,025
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

809
01:11:13,595 --> 01:11:16,553
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

810
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:21,545
- He was a police informer!
- Jimmy a grass? Are you fucking mad?

811
01:11:21,755 --> 01:11:25,350
- You will have to do better than that.
- I have got a recording at home.

812
01:11:25,555 --> 01:11:28,831
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

813
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:34,109
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

814
01:11:34,315 --> 01:11:37,990
If he's lying, we will both fucking kill him.

815
01:11:38,195 --> 01:11:40,311
Mr. Mortimer reckons

816
01:11:40,515 --> 01:11:45,908
the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.

817
01:11:46,115 --> 01:11:49,266
They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.

818
01:11:49,475 --> 01:11:53,548
I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.

819
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:58,226
Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?

820
01:11:58,435 --> 01:12:02,348
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

821
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:05,308
What? About me working for the old firm?

822
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:09,666
Convinced?

823
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,946
You don't fuck about, do you?

824
01:12:22,035 --> 01:12:24,868
Jimmy was skint, huh?

825
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:28,351
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

826
01:12:32,355 --> 01:12:36,553
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

827
01:12:36,755 --> 01:12:38,711
Really?

828
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:43,271
Why did you kill Larry?

829
01:12:46,235 --> 01:12:49,795
Funnily enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

830
01:12:49,915 --> 01:12:51,746
Jimmy never liked Larry for the start.

831
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:55,186
Look at that wrong 'un waving
his money around. It ain't right.

832
01:12:56,275 --> 01:12:58,550
Hey, I love you, man.

833
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:04,227
He saw the future was drugs
and it needed to be run like a business.

834
01:13:04,435 --> 01:13:06,585
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

835
01:13:06,795 --> 01:13:09,263
After that business with Kilburn Jerry...

836
01:13:09,475 --> 01:13:13,309
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

837
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:15,954
...he wanted him gone.

838
01:13:18,955 --> 01:13:21,833
I didn't have any problem doing him.

839
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,151
That's why I did it.

840
01:13:28,355 --> 01:13:30,664
But why did you keep the gun?

841
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:34,424
Sounds silly now, but it was my favorite.

842
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:38,786
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you have got favorites.

843
01:13:44,515 --> 01:13:46,949
So what's the next move, boss?

844
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:53,190
Well, I am going to bed.

845
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:57,070
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

846
01:14:29,195 --> 01:14:30,992
Sorry?

847
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:37,551
Sorry, mate, what was that?

848
01:14:37,755 --> 01:14:40,792
Would you pack that in?
I have got a fucking test next week.

849
01:14:40,995 --> 01:14:43,668
OK. OK, I am sorry. I was just saying...

850
01:14:58,315 --> 01:15:00,909
So when does the target get here, then?

851
01:15:01,115 --> 01:15:04,152
The target? The target's going to be here
at exactly midday.

852
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:05,583
Where?

853
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:07,911
- Here, right fucking here.
- Got a photo?

854
01:15:08,115 --> 01:15:10,151
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

855
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:13,347
I will have some binoculars.
I will give you a little signal.

856
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:16,752
I could get the 13.10 home from here.

857
01:15:16,955 --> 01:15:18,513
Let's have a little recce.

858
01:15:20,035 --> 01:15:22,868
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

859
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:25,669
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

860
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,911
Don't run, whatever you do.

861
01:15:28,115 --> 01:15:31,312
The first five minutes,
nobody will have a clue what's going on.

862
01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:34,427
Hopefully, it will be mayhem.

863
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:40,989
So try to stay relaxed.

864
01:15:41,915 --> 01:15:45,066
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

865
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:45,995
Or me.

866
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:53,027
Afterwards, take me to the Underground
station. I will look after myself.

867
01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:58,023
There.

868
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:02,266
Time?

869
01:16:04,035 --> 01:16:06,390
Six minutes to twelve.

870
01:16:09,635 --> 01:16:11,387
I hope he's not going to be late.

871
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:18,066
- Maybe he will be early.
- That will be nice.

872
01:16:29,355 --> 01:16:31,664
Can you see that guy on the left?

873
01:16:36,795 --> 01:16:41,710
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

874
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:48,070
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I am going to call him.

875
01:16:48,955 --> 01:16:51,594
It's up to you. You're the client.

876
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:02,074
- As soon as he answers, he's gone, OK?
- Okey-dokey.

877
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:07,714
Stand by.

878
01:17:11,475 --> 01:17:12,475
Now.

879
01:17:14,675 --> 01:17:18,350
Hello, may I help you?

880
01:17:20,155 --> 01:17:24,945
Don't move a muscle.

881
01:17:25,155 --> 01:17:29,273
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

882
01:17:29,475 --> 01:17:34,674
You English, you have no idea
of honor and respect.

883
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:40,825
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duke.

884
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:44,788
- I haven't got your pills.
- Just give me a day.

885
01:17:46,155 --> 01:17:49,511
Don't piss in my pocket
and tell me it's raining.

886
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:51,387
Now listen for the last time.

887
01:17:51,595 --> 01:17:55,952
- You will bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!

888
01:17:56,155 --> 01:17:59,989
You have one more day.

889
01:18:01,235 --> 01:18:06,992
See you tomorrow at dusk by the statue.
Remember, I will be watching you.

890
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:17,392
What the fuck were you thinking?

891
01:18:19,555 --> 01:18:22,752
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

892
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:27,424
Trevor's going to go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

893
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:29,865
- What a fucking mess.
- You have gone mad.

894
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:31,827
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

895
01:18:32,035 --> 01:18:34,230
You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.

896
01:18:34,435 --> 01:18:37,711
If you do it near me,
I will put you in a fucking wheelchair.

897
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:40,586
Stick to your fucking sums.

898
01:18:41,435 --> 01:18:43,824
Listen. Listen to me.

899
01:18:44,035 --> 01:18:46,185
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

900
01:18:46,395 --> 01:18:49,705
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

901
01:18:49,915 --> 01:18:52,509
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

902
01:18:52,715 --> 01:18:56,754
- I wish.
- Fuck off! It could have been you or Morty.

903
01:18:59,595 --> 01:19:03,383
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

904
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,525
What?

905
01:19:12,235 --> 01:19:14,829
I should have told you this earlier.

906
01:19:15,555 --> 01:19:18,513
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

907
01:19:18,715 --> 01:19:23,664
Paul the boatman was topped last night.
I have got to get on my toes sharpish.

908
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:26,389
I want Jimmy
brought here right now, yeah?

909
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:30,907
Getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard
to tell Duke those pills were useless,

910
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:33,265
after sending us over in the first place.

911
01:19:33,475 --> 01:19:35,306
Hang on, you have lost me now.

912
01:19:35,515 --> 01:19:39,952
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I will call the fucking law.

913
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:42,715
- What are you talking about?
- I will call the law.

914
01:19:42,715 --> 01:19:44,826
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

915
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:47,708
Shut the fuck up!

916
01:20:05,435 --> 01:20:08,188
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

917
01:20:08,395 --> 01:20:11,034
You're not in there because I like you.

918
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,705
I am beginning to feel left out.

919
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:17,348
Why?

920
01:20:17,555 --> 01:20:20,069
Freddie Hurst is still in intensive care

921
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:23,585
after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

922
01:20:23,795 --> 01:20:26,025
Fucking hell, Duke.

923
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,624
For once, you might be of some use.

924
01:20:45,115 --> 01:20:48,425
That was Gazza on the phone. It's on.

925
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:52,389
He will pick you up at nine in the morning.
Gallows Corner. You know it?

926
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:53,869
Yeah.

927
01:20:54,075 --> 01:20:59,547
With Jimmy gone, these pills will make
a nice contribution to my retirement fund,

928
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:02,349
so don't fuck things up again, OK?

929
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:08,630
If you do, you will wish this Dragan had
shot you between the eyes, understand?

930
01:21:09,955 --> 01:21:11,911
Best of luck.

931
01:21:13,955 --> 01:21:15,274
Thanks.

932
01:21:36,915 --> 01:21:38,189
Fuck off!

933
01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:41,785
Sidney, I have told you,
stop answering my phone, OK?

934
01:21:41,995 --> 01:21:43,633
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

935
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,348
- All right?
- Hello, Sidney.

936
01:22:22,555 --> 01:22:25,786
- How you doing, then?
- I am all right. How are you?

937
01:22:25,995 --> 01:22:27,553
I am all right, mate, yeah.

938
01:22:55,835 --> 01:23:00,545
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. 50 pence a pill.

939
01:23:00,755 --> 01:23:02,905
That way, we all come out
with something.

940
01:23:03,115 --> 01:23:08,235
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

941
01:23:08,235 --> 01:23:12,189
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

942
01:23:12,395 --> 01:23:15,307
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from,

943
01:23:15,515 --> 01:23:17,710
they'd kill you like you'd take a piss.

944
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,504
Gazza, the Old Bill are outside!

945
01:23:23,555 --> 01:23:25,785
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

946
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:28,745
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

947
01:23:28,955 --> 01:23:31,025
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

948
01:23:31,235 --> 01:23:34,830
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're going to get us all shot.

949
01:23:36,195 --> 01:23:37,913
Fuck it! Boat!

950
01:23:57,995 --> 01:23:59,951
Stay there!

951
01:24:11,075 --> 01:24:12,713
Fuck!

952
01:24:18,115 --> 01:24:19,753
Come on!

953
01:24:28,115 --> 01:24:31,346
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

954
01:24:31,555 --> 01:24:33,113
Get in.

955
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:22,674
Is this for me?

956
01:25:26,315 --> 01:25:28,112
Yes.

957
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,628
Your cargo's gone, I am afraid.

958
01:25:38,835 --> 01:25:41,747
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

959
01:25:41,955 --> 01:25:45,106
- How do you know?
- I watched.

960
01:25:45,315 --> 01:25:48,466
I don't believe this.
Captain's going to go fucking spare!

961
01:25:48,675 --> 01:25:51,872
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

962
01:25:52,075 --> 01:25:54,828
Oh, fucking hell.

963
01:25:55,035 --> 01:25:57,674
Leave it to me, lads.
I will explain to Inspector Cox

964
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:01,026
that his suspect has scarpered
because of your blundering.

965
01:26:01,235 --> 01:26:03,191
Knobheads. Helmets off.

966
01:26:11,635 --> 01:26:14,149
Does this settle things, then?

967
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:36,309
Tango Foxtrot, over.

968
01:26:36,515 --> 01:26:38,983
Delta Uniform...

969
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,507
How did that other errand go?

970
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:51,593
Success, as far as I could make out.

971
01:26:54,995 --> 01:26:57,304
Where is my fucking prisoner?

972
01:26:57,515 --> 01:27:00,393
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

973
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:03,063
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

974
01:27:03,275 --> 01:27:05,664
- Indigo...
- Dingo Bongo.

975
01:27:06,795 --> 01:27:09,514
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

976
01:27:09,715 --> 01:27:11,114
You can fuck off, then.

977
01:27:12,115 --> 01:27:15,346
So where are the pills, genius?

978
01:27:15,555 --> 01:27:17,944
I think this is them now.

979
01:27:20,955 --> 01:27:23,344
What the fuck?

980
01:27:26,155 --> 01:27:28,385
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

981
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:34,668
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

982
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:38,834
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

983
01:27:39,035 --> 01:27:42,072
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

984
01:28:17,515 --> 01:28:18,743
Hello.

985
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:24,268
OK. Yes, I will do. Bye-bye.

986
01:28:27,995 --> 01:28:31,624
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

987
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:36,752
Good news.

988
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:40,184
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

989
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:42,625
Listen, I have got one for you.

990
01:28:42,835 --> 01:28:45,224
Irishman caught his son snorting Charlie.

991
01:28:45,435 --> 01:28:49,667
He said, " If I catch you doing that again,
I will rub your fucking nose in it."

992
01:29:14,155 --> 01:29:17,033
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

993
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:20,991
Boss wants to see you in his office.

994
01:29:29,515 --> 01:29:31,904
Come in. Sit down.

995
01:29:37,115 --> 01:29:39,390
Here you are. Payment.

996
01:29:51,035 --> 01:29:54,744
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

997
01:29:54,955 --> 01:30:00,985
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

998
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:04,312
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

999
01:30:04,515 --> 01:30:08,303
I am keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

1000
01:30:08,515 --> 01:30:12,906
I think I am entitled. Simple. End of.

1001
01:30:13,115 --> 01:30:16,744
The amount of trouble
you have caused the last few days.

1002
01:30:16,955 --> 01:30:18,673
Jimmy.

1003
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,945
Poor little Jimmy.

1004
01:30:21,675 --> 01:30:23,427
It would be in your interests

1005
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:26,707
if this thing finishes here, now, today.
Understand?

1006
01:30:27,795 --> 01:30:31,583
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are going to come after you.

1007
01:30:32,675 --> 01:30:35,906
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country,

1008
01:30:36,115 --> 01:30:39,152
looking for revenge. Look at them.

1009
01:30:39,355 --> 01:30:42,984
Bunch of under-endowed,
ageing fuck pigs.

1010
01:30:43,195 --> 01:30:44,867
Are you enjoying this?

1011
01:30:45,075 --> 01:30:47,987
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

1012
01:30:48,195 --> 01:30:50,072
You're a bright young man.

1013
01:30:50,275 --> 01:30:53,073
This monkey business is in your blood,
under your skin.

1014
01:30:53,275 --> 01:30:57,109
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I have every faith in you.

1015
01:30:57,315 --> 01:31:03,914
One day, it will be you sitting here telling
some young Turk the facts of life.

1016
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,831
And they are, Mr. Temple?

1017
01:31:14,555 --> 01:31:17,149
You're born, you take shit.

1018
01:31:17,355 --> 01:31:20,665
Get out in the world, you take more shit.

1019
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:24,993
Climb a little higher, you take less shit.

1020
01:31:25,195 --> 01:31:27,868
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere,

1021
01:31:28,075 --> 01:31:30,384
and you have forgotten what shit
even looks like.

1022
01:31:33,115 --> 01:31:35,390
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

1023
01:31:51,555 --> 01:31:54,547
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

1024
01:31:55,195 --> 01:31:57,834
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

1025
01:31:58,395 --> 01:32:01,592
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

1026
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:03,023
Goodnight.

1027
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:39,224
If you're going to hang around in this game,
that's where you have got to be.

1028
01:32:39,435 --> 01:32:43,394
In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work,

1029
01:32:43,595 --> 01:32:45,665
while you deliver the suspect lecture

1030
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:49,106
to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.

1031
01:32:50,155 --> 01:32:54,273
The art of good business
is being a good middleman.

1032
01:32:54,475 --> 01:32:58,673
Putting people together. I will always
thank Eddie for telling me that.

1033
01:33:00,115 --> 01:33:02,948
It's all about honor and respect.

1034
01:33:03,755 --> 01:33:07,031
This is the end, Mr. Duke, as I told you.

1035
01:33:49,515 --> 01:33:55,067
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

1036
01:33:55,275 --> 01:33:59,063
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

1037
01:34:00,515 --> 01:34:03,666
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

1038
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:07,345
I will let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

1039
01:34:07,555 --> 01:34:12,629
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

1040
01:34:13,275 --> 01:34:14,754
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1041
01:34:15,595 --> 01:34:19,304
Did I really think Eddie was going to
give me three million for those pills?

1042
01:34:19,515 --> 01:34:21,551
Did I fuck.

1043
01:34:21,755 --> 01:34:25,714
But suddenly there was a void
where once there was Jimmy Price.

1044
01:34:25,915 --> 01:34:30,306
And after a couple of days, Eddie's little
getting-in-and-getting-out speech

1045
01:34:30,515 --> 01:34:33,473
started to make sense.

1046
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:02,111
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1047
01:35:02,315 --> 01:35:04,909
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

1048
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:13,712
The king is dead.

1049
01:35:14,595 --> 01:35:16,267
Long live the king.

1050
01:35:21,075 --> 01:35:22,747
Well, I am honored.

1051
01:35:24,835 --> 01:35:28,066
But for me this is all over. I am getting out.

1052
01:35:28,275 --> 01:35:30,425
What was true then is true now.

1053
01:35:31,315 --> 01:35:34,466
Have a plan. Stick to it.

1054
01:35:34,675 --> 01:35:37,109
So I am sure you must have
lots to discuss,

1055
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,670
but I have no business being here.

1056
01:35:41,595 --> 01:35:43,825
I have got someone to meet.

1057
