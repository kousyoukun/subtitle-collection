1
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:31,886
<i>When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.</i>

2
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:36,998
<i>It was all just cops and robbers.</i>

3
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:51,747
Fucking get down! Get down now!

4
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,078
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

5
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,118
<i>But it wasn't for me.</i>

6
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>Then came the Summer of Love.</i>

7
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,924
<i>Hashish and LSD
arrived on the scene.</i>

8
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,601
<i>There were villains
locked away for 12 years...</i>

9
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,674
<i>... for robbing a bank of 10 grand...</i>

10
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,539
<i>... doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months...</i>

11
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,514
<i>... for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.</i>

12
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:28,449
<i>I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.</i>

13
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:34,159
<i>Drugs changed everything.</i>

14
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,997
<i>Always remember that one day this
drug monkey-business will be legal.</i>

15
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,441
<i>They won't leave it to people like me
when they figure out...</i>

16
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:57,448
<i>... how much money there is to be
made: Not millions, fucking billions.</i>

17
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:02,316
<i>Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.</i>

18
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:05,493
<i>Good times today, stupor tomorrow.</i>

19
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,030
<i>But this is now.</i>

20
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:23,201
<i>So, until prohibition ends,
make hay while the sun shines.</i>

21
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,553
<i>I'm not a gangster.</i>

22
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:35,714
<i>I'm a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.</i>

23
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:40,863
<i>Ten years ago, charlie was for pop
stars or a celebrity's birthday bash.</i>

24
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:45,091
<i>It was demonized by Daily Mail
readers getting drunk in wine bars.</i>

25
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:49,601
<i>Now they're my biggest clients.</i>

26
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:55,674
<i>This is Clarkie. Double first
at Cambridge in Industrial Chemistry.</i>

27
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,677
<i>Well, he's gotta pay off
his student loan somehow.</i>

28
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>Today, I only deal in kilos.</i>

29
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,716
<i>Depending which tariff you use...</i>

30
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:10,552
<i>... that'll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison...</i>

31
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,889
<i>... which is more time than a rapist.</i>

32
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,690
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

33
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:20,461
<i>It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.</i>

34
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:22,606
<i>Always work in a small team.</i>

35
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:27,574
<i>Keep a very low profile. Only deal
with people who come recommended.</i>

36
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,474
<i>It's like selling anything:</i>

37
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,149
<i>Washing machines,
handmade shoes, blowjobs.</i>

38
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,218
<i>As long as you don't take the piss,
people will come back for more.</i>

39
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:40,722
<i>That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that makes two kilos three...</i>

40
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>... but never be too greedy.</i>

41
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,160
<i>Know and respect your enemy.</i>

42
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:57,968
<i>It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.</i>

43
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:05,446
<i>And avoid like the fucking plague...</i>

44
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,621
<i>... loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters...</i>

45
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:11,449
<i>... in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.</i>

46
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:16,458
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, it's the Duke.

47
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:20,098
Everything's sweet.
When can we meet?

48
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,498
<i>They don't mean to fuck up.
They just do.</i>

49
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:37,910
<i>Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.</i>

50
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:41,788
<i>They are guaranteed
to bring you trouble.</i>

51
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,218
<i>As do guns.</i>

52
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,722
<i>I hate guns. And violence.</i>

53
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,294
<i>But as some Roman general
once said:</i>

54
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,660
<i>"If you seek peace, plan for war."</i>

55
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:57,827
<i>Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.</i>

56
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,338
<i>Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did 10 years inside.</i>

57
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:05,545
<i>He's my bridge
to the criminal world...</i>

58
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:08,648
<i>... and he ensures that
the traffic is one-way.</i>

59
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:12,049
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe... dorfe.

60
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:15,882
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

61
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,821
- Get in the car. I'm sure it's that way.
- Move up.

62
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,928
- I bet you it's that way.
- We've already been that way.

63
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,226
Yeah, but we're gonna go
that way again. Give us the map.

64
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:29,996
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

65
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,696
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

66
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:36,742
- All day you've been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

67
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:39,778
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

68
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,746
Morty.

69
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:46,421
Terence.

70
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:47,918
Clarkie.

71
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,993
<i>Very, very important:
Pay your supplier prompt.</i>

72
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:58,497
<i>In our case, that's Mr. Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.</i>

73
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,637
<i>Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.</i>

74
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,037
<i>You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.</i>

75
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,709
Where the fuck is Gene?

76
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:13,508
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

77
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,684
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

78
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,376
Shut the fuck up.

79
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,315
Patience.

80
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:25,188
<i>Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.</i>

81
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,555
<i>Been with him since way back.</i>

82
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,494
<i>All the drugs and cash
go through Gene.</i>

83
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,101
<i>Jimmy trusts him with his life.</i>

84
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:43,670
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

85
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:48,548
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

86
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:53,348
Why does everybody assume there's
a problem because he wants a word?

87
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:58,154
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

88
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:00,297
See you at Stoke Park at one.

89
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:07,098
This is just so beautiful.

90
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,671
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

91
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,935
Paul and the tide ain't gonna wait.

92
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,853
<i>Everyone likes to walk
through a door marked "Private."</i>

93
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:30,619
<i>Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.</i>

94
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,491
<i>I own a share in a very successful
letting agency.</i>

95
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,931
<i>It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.</i>

96
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:45,208
<i>Whereas years ago scallywags were
trying to get money out of banks...</i>

97
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:49,370
<i>... now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.</i>

98
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:52,517
<i>That's a job for Mr. Singh.
He does my laundry.</i>

99
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,210
<i>And in a week,
it will be ready for collection...</i>

100
00:07:55,422 --> 00:08:00,826
<i>... in the form of a nice clean check
for a round million.</i>

101
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,297
<i>The business is on the up and up.</i>

102
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:07,625
<i>But I've always said,
have a plan and stick to it.</i>

103
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,825
<i>Quit while you're ahead.</i>

104
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:13,006
<i>So barring any fuck-ups,
I'm leaving it all behind.</i>

105
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,198
No, we got the parcel.

106
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,708
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

107
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:22,576
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

108
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,249
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

109
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:31,721
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

110
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:33,951
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.

111
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,255
You're being paid to get
my cargo home.

112
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:41,329
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

113
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:46,998
<i>Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.</i>

114
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,806
<i>I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like the Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.</i>

115
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,381
<i>And then leave quietly forever.</i>

116
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,542
This is pure class.

117
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:09,458
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

118
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,958
Mr. Price is in the Oval Room.

119
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,975
- Your guests, Mr. Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

120
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:34,015
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

121
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:37,314
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

122
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:40,218
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

123
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,257
We all have to do our bit.

124
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:45,395
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

125
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:49,328
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

126
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,533
Let's eat.

127
00:10:57,943 --> 00:10:59,308
Right.

128
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:02,970
We've gotta test the "snap, crackle
and pop" factor on these.

129
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:06,345
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching them.

130
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:08,645
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,421
- Brian.
- What?

132
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:19,531
Sit down, mate.
Got a little treat for you.

133
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,603
Help yourself.

134
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,348
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

135
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,259
What do you want, son?

136
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:00,896
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

137
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,109
A shot at the title?
A seat by the band?

138
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:16,417
Well, I don't know, Mr. Price.
That's a very expansive question.

139
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:18,957
Right, expansive. Good answer.

140
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:22,652
Years ago, people would've
thought you were a homosexual...

141
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:24,492
...using a word like "expansive."

142
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,327
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

143
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:30,528
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

144
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:32,969
No, I didn't think you were.

145
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:36,303
No harm in it, I suppose.
Times change.

146
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:42,345
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

147
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:50,288
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

148
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:54,122
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favor.

149
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,390
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

150
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,933
Not a two-a-penny loudmouth.
Too many grasses around.

151
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:06,770
- It would be a pleasure, Mr. Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

152
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,979
Now, this favor. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

153
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:16,576
Like a blood brother.
We were at school together.

154
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,550
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

155
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,725
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

156
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:25,760
I'll give you a clue. Eddie Temple.

157
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:28,295
Does that name
mean anything to you?

158
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,229
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

159
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,335
Charlie, bless her.

160
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,337
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

161
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,239
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

162
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,778
Or to give her her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

163
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,475
But she ain't behaving like a lady.

164
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:50,814
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong one.

165
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:54,787
This is where you come in, right?
You're gonna find her.

166
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:59,422
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

167
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,997
Well, you should get
a private detective.

168
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,469
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

169
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:12,803
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

170
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,206
Rehab.

171
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:20,079
She got loved up in there with
some lowlife crackhead called Kinky.

172
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:22,310
I reckon they've gone
back to London.

173
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,113
I wouldn't know where to begin.

174
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:28,282
Now and then we're asked to do
something beyond the call of duty.

175
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:30,961
It's called sacrifice, son.

176
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,057
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

177
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:39,595
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

178
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:42,366
Keep Mr. McGuire posted.

179
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:50,439
I've also got a little business
more in your usual line.

180
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,413
Gene will fill you in.

181
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,678
Everything was to your satisfaction?

182
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:57,516
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

183
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:05,859
Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

184
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:09,297
Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done.

185
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:12,869
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

186
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,544
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

187
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:26,085
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

188
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:31,884
Tell you about that bit of business. I've
set up a meet for five with the Duke.

189
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,068
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

190
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,501
These are super Es.
We'll make millions!

191
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:49,404
I don't care. This is my boatyard.

192
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,774
I want those pills and that fucking idiot
out of here now.

193
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:55,882
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

194
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:59,781
I've got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You'll be in your whack.

195
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:02,721
Here, chill. Have a pill.

196
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:08,021
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

197
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,825
Yeah, why are we
dealing with this joker?

198
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:15,266
He's a fucking maniac, a relic, a
throwback, belongs to the Dark Ages.

199
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:17,666
Will you just shut the fuck up?

200
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:20,934
We're dealing with him because
he has one million Ecstasy pills...

201
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:23,941
...of very high levels
of MDMA, okay?

202
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,341
One million?

203
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:29,708
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

204
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,910
Jimmy wants 50 percent netto.

205
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,920
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger,
this lot.

206
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,254
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

207
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:41,624
Calm down. You'll feel better
once you've got your money.

208
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:45,528
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

209
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,133
Come on.

210
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:55,771
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, okay?

211
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,675
Who? Me?

212
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:01,779
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I'm some kind of mug.

213
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:06,923
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

214
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,285
You wanna know
how much they're worth.

215
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:11,688
Yes, fucking, please!

216
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:15,298
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market...

217
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,334
...don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

218
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,005
They're not.

219
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,139
We've gotta find a buyer.

220
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,744
They've gotta split them into parcels.
They've gotta find these people.

221
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,813
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

222
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:35,919
Then you've got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

223
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,883
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

224
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:43,721
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

225
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,359
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

226
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:55,836
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth 5 million easy.

227
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,374
- Five pound each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

228
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,443
It doesn't work like that!

229
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:05,310
Don't keep fucking
saying that to me!

230
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,318
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, okay?

231
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,824
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

232
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,554
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?

233
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,326
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

234
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,597
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

235
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,672
We know someone up north
who'll buy.

236
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,743
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

237
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,581
What's really bothering me
is what color to get the Aston.

238
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,756
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

239
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,651
- Green?
- Yeah.

240
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,919
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

241
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,756
Black. Yeah, black.

242
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,455
Black's the color
for a hearse or a taxi.

243
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,999
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

244
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:59,298
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

245
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:03,341
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

246
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,804
Hugo, follow me.

247
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:08,312
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

248
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:10,815
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

249
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:17,818
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

250
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,518
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

251
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,288
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

252
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:25,990
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

253
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:29,659
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

254
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:32,397
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

255
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:37,136
- How quickly?
- Twenty grand quickly.

256
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:39,371
You've got our attention.

257
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,921
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

258
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,717
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

259
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:55,829
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

260
00:19:56,566 --> 00:20:00,332
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.

261
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:02,562
Chuck them a few quid,
they'll cough.

262
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,441
- Is there anything else?
- No.

263
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,934
We must get back to work, old boy.

264
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:12,313
Look.

265
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:17,215
All right, mate.
I'm the Duke's nephew.

266
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:19,285
Remember me? Sidney.

267
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:23,323
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are
you? I'm just off. Have a nice night.

268
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,518
How you doing?
What you doing here?

269
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:28,822
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

270
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,467
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

271
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,509
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

272
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,440
He's a good mate of my uncle's,
the Duke. He was just going.

273
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:46,707
Yeah, well, stick around and
have a drink before you do, yeah?

274
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:53,952
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

275
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:01,690
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

276
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:05,334
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

277
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,903
If you want anything, just tell me...

278
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:10,370
...because I got them
straightened out in here.

279
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:13,635
If you want any running about,
I'm your man...

280
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:44,006
- Line?
- What?

281
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,735
I said do you want a line?

282
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:50,676
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

283
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:58,421
Lovely, isn't she?
Isn't she a darling?

284
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,252
Isn't she?

285
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:03,224
Siddy, baby,
I could do with a livener.

286
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:13,536
Sidney, it's been great. I'll see you,
man. Thanks for the champagne.

287
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,766
All right.

288
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:35,623
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr. Lucky.

289
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,392
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

290
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:41,296
Everyone wants a slice as well.

291
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:44,598
Same wherever you go.
Greedy people.

292
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:47,366
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

293
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:51,341
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

294
00:22:51,713 --> 00:22:53,545
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

295
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:58,083
Well, not you lot, but...

296
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:01,051
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

297
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,157
No offense, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

298
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,654
You really surprise me,
do you know that?

299
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:11,163
Do you know something we don't?

300
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:16,772
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

301
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:21,706
Because I am not a fucking prick.

302
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:26,872
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it. They really don't know.

303
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:31,546
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

304
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,484
Last weekend, right?

305
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,126
The whole place is alight
with a rumor...

306
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:40,490
...about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end...

307
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:45,600
...run by this joker called the Duke...

308
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:48,237
Gazza, go and find
them fucking pills.

309
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:51,771
All right. Come on.
Have a look in here.

310
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:57,876
<i>They skanked this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.</i>

311
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:02,075
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

312
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:03,651
Shut up.

313
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:05,981
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

314
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,090
Shut up or I'll be the last.

315
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,725
Fuck me.

316
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,728
<i>They got lucky. He'd just
knocked up a massive batch.</i>

317
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:21,201
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

318
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,699
Stay down there. Yes?

319
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,372
You watch them.

320
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:36,479
That looks very heavy for you,
darling.

321
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:37,882
Fuck off.

322
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,524
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

323
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:49,234
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl. Shut up!

324
00:24:54,374 --> 00:24:56,807
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

325
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:58,477
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

326
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:01,169
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

327
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,882
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

328
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,960
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

329
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:19,962
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

330
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:28,065
This will not be the end of this,
Mr. Duke, believe me.

331
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:32,234
Gazza, go and load them pills.

332
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:36,883
<i>But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.</i>

333
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:41,111
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

334
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,052
They're wanted
by the United-fucking-Nations.

335
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:48,020
- Think about that.
- Let's get this clear.

336
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:53,800
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

337
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:57,129
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

338
00:25:57,337 --> 00:26:00,068
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

339
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:04,507
<i>Word on the straat is they've
unleashed their top boy.</i>

340
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,859
His party piece, right...

341
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,258
...is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

342
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:24,455
It's all about honor and respect...

343
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:29,070
...with these head-banging
nationalist outfits.

344
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:34,174
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

345
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:38,244
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

346
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:41,382
Okay, we accept that.

347
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:46,544
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

348
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,149
Bad.

349
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:56,361
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

350
00:26:56,566 --> 00:27:01,435
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

351
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:08,172
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.

352
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,312
Me and him need to have
a little think.

353
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,138
Don't think too long. Someone's
gonna make a killing on these pills.

354
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:18,879
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

355
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,760
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

356
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:30,957
I told you he was trouble. But he
ain't gonna drag me down with him.

357
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,434
Try Gene again.
What a fucking show-up!

358
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,903
- He's not answering, Mort.
- Okay.

359
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:42,038
Try Jimmy at home.

360
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,511
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

361
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:51,618
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boatyard.

362
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:54,519
Somebody's about
to get a fucking slap.

363
00:27:54,726 --> 00:27:57,455
Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

364
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,712
Paul?

365
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:47,945
What a way to go.

366
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:53,077
An iron burning a hole in your chest
until your heart boils.

367
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:56,484
Paulie would've told him anything,
then, wouldn't he?

368
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:03,763
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

369
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:11,299
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make
some phone calls, but really quietly.

370
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:14,303
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

371
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:17,171
We're gonna need
an insurance policy.

372
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:21,974
What's the idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, prick!

373
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:26,984
<i>- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!</i>

374
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:33,183
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills ain't worth shit?

375
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:35,293
<i>You don't know
the problems you've caused.</i>

376
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:40,060
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes...

377
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,099
...to find that bitch Charlie.

378
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:45,034
I fucking told you to do it!

379
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,833
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

380
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,878
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

381
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,276
I don't give a fuck!

382
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:26,310
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

383
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:29,747
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

384
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:32,979
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

385
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,751
No, I haven't. He's in here.

386
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:49,071
Kinky.

387
00:30:49,272 --> 00:30:52,106
I still wanna be paid.

388
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:05,249
So, if I'm correct, you three gearheads
are gonna be clucking very soon.

389
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:09,415
In fact, you're gonna be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

390
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:11,857
But I'm prepared to do you a favor.

391
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,194
We can do this one of two ways.

392
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,968
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you'll prefer.

393
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,572
Because the other way
is my friend takes you...

394
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:24,936
...and puts your head
through the window!

395
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:30,044
Right, so, was Charlie here
with Kinky?

396
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:34,310
Yeah, she was here for a couple days.
Kinky turned up with 5 grand.

397
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:37,420
- Who's giving Kinky 5 grand?
- We don't know.

398
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:40,889
<i>They kept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy...</i>

399
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:44,654
<i>... taking the 5 grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.</i>

400
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,456
Where is she now?

401
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,734
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

402
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:53,803
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there. It's dark.

403
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:58,967
But I sees this geezer all in black.
Like something out of a kung fu film.

404
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:03,513
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

405
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:07,652
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

406
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:11,984
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

407
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:15,059
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

408
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:17,457
You're telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

409
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:20,565
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

410
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,531
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

411
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:25,795
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

412
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:28,497
Shut the fuck up!

413
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,768
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

414
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:32,275
Get the fucking money!

415
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:35,038
Morty! Morty!

416
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:37,774
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

417
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:40,784
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

418
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:44,014
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.

419
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:48,286
- All right. And 10 G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

420
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,592
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

421
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:59,404
Hello. Ambulance, please.

422
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:03,042
185 Kirby House, King's Cross.

423
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:08,047
There's a dead boy.
The door's open.

424
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,481
My name?

425
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:13,314
185 Kirby House.

426
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,731
I'm not happy.

427
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:36,941
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out, or I'll sort you out.

428
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,808
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

429
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:47,116
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off to Brighton.

430
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:49,484
Cody's gonna find her.

431
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:58,064
Look, I'm gonna freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

432
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,540
Morty?

433
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,405
Is that you?

434
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,875
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

435
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:16,480
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

436
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,249
Hello, Freddie.

437
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,007
So...

438
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:45,182
...Mr. Mortimer.

439
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:50,047
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us
a few quid, for old times' sake?

440
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,220
You look well flushed, bruv.

441
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,592
Fuck me, he's loaded.

442
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:06,000
Here, couldn't make it 5,
could you...

443
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,637
...mate?

444
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,508
- Let's make it 10.
- Yeah.

445
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,736
Ten's...

446
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,514
...a nice...

447
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:19,746
...round number.

448
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,118
What's the matter?

449
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,708
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

450
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:52,018
Going off?
Or do you need a red light?

451
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:58,757
Morty. Enough.
He's had enough.

452
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:03,191
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

453
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:13,037
But let's forget about all that.

454
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,970
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr. Hurst.

455
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:43,634
What the fuck?

456
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,799
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

457
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:00,118
<i>- It's me.
- Hey.</i>

458
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,621
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.

459
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,351
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

460
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:38,523
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.

461
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,287
No, I'm fine, thank you.

462
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,493
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

463
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,899
He used to run with me, Morty and
Jimmy in this real kamikaze firm.

464
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:51,405
<i>In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.</i>

465
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:54,133
<i>Yeah. Got shot, didn't he?
Bit of a lunatic.</i>

466
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:57,542
<i>That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.</i>

467
00:37:57,749 --> 00:37:59,579
<i>Always doing loads of drugs.</i>

468
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:03,817
<i>Not worried about
keeping a low profile.</i>

469
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:05,216
I love you.

470
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:07,323
<i>Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.</i>

471
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,960
No fucking problem.
Boys will be boys.

472
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:14,098
<i>Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...</i>

473
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,990
<i>... shoots himself stone dead.</i>

474
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,829
This is a bit of a dilemma.

475
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,600
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

476
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,743
<i>Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty...</i>

477
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:29,471
<i>... actually volunteered
to dispose of the body.</i>

478
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,810
No head.
But things went a bit wrong.

479
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:38,421
<i>The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.</i>

480
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:42,117
<i>The total imbecile had fallen asleep
at some traffic lights...</i>

481
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,058
<i>... in a drunken,
drug-induced stupor.</i>

482
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:50,292
<i>Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.</i>

483
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,267
<i>Being black was even worse
than being Irish.</i>

484
00:38:53,473 --> 00:38:55,703
<i>They threw the book at Morty.</i>

485
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:58,104
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

486
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:01,803
Morty did 10 years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

487
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:03,949
But he kept his mouth shut.

488
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,950
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

489
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:10,884
All because some kid
was being ridden against his will...

490
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:13,924
...by a psychotic lunatic.
- Who?

491
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:18,089
<i>But you, you fuck!</i>

492
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,064
Larry.

493
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:23,965
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

494
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:27,503
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

495
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:30,006
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

496
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,042
Probably.

497
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:37,412
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

498
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:41,346
Not for me.

499
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:47,388
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

500
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:51,031
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage.

501
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:56,236
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

502
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:59,770
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty...

503
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:04,935
...or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

504
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:12,386
You know, I will have one of those.

505
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:22,230
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

506
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:24,866
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

507
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:29,505
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

508
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,972
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs babysit these.

509
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:41,115
Gene, what the fuck
am I gonna do about these Serbs?

510
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:47,857
Come here.
I have something for you.

511
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:59,067
- You're gonna need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

512
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:05,004
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

513
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,905
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

514
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:11,445
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

515
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:14,277
Hey, point it upwards.

516
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,518
Oh, for fuck's sake.

517
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,349
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

518
00:41:41,046 --> 00:41:43,481
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

519
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:46,982
I can, and I do.

520
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:52,852
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

521
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,020
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task...

522
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:02,894
...so the rest of the mind can find
peace.

523
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:09,502
And you find peace with guns.

524
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,871
Well, on occasion.
It has been known.

525
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,847
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

526
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:27,259
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never ever tell a living soul.

527
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:50,013
<i>- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.</i>

528
00:42:53,221 --> 00:42:55,279
How did you get this number?

529
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,790
<i>Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.</i>

530
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,623
<i>I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer...</i>

531
00:43:03,865 --> 00:43:07,596
<i>... and you're the person I should talk
to about the return of this cargo...</i>

532
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:10,897
<i>... stolen by your associate,
the Duke.</i>

533
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:14,637
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

534
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,606
<i>Mr. Duke came to Amsterdam,
used your name...</i>

535
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,906
<i>... said he worked for you.</i>

536
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,580
<i>- Are you listening?
- Dragan...</i>

537
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:34,889
...l've got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

538
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:38,658
I'll squeeze some orange juice,
and we'll talk about this like adults.

539
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,303
<i>- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.</i>

540
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:44,233
<i>- Do you know where I live?
- No.</i>

541
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,134
Well, fuck off, then.

542
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:00,583
<i>Duke's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.</i>

543
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:03,884
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

544
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:07,688
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.

545
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:11,833
You've got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I'm sending them back, okay?

546
00:44:12,035 --> 00:44:15,096
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

547
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:18,399
It ain't worth the grief. We've gone
underground, off the radar.

548
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:21,077
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

549
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:39,089
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

550
00:44:39,296 --> 00:44:44,132
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

551
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:46,303
Between you and
that gobshite Duke...

552
00:44:46,503 --> 00:44:48,529
...he's promised Jimmy
a bumper payday.

553
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,333
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

554
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,408
He put yous together.

555
00:44:53,612 --> 00:44:56,637
You and Duke. That's his job.

556
00:44:56,848 --> 00:45:02,548
If you two can't make music, he's
gonna want his whack out either way.

557
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:12,026
That's business.

558
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,405
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

559
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:25,634
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

560
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:28,870
Well, I am beginning
to regret it now.

561
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:33,582
We've gotta find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

562
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:36,220
We can't rely on these monkeys
to call Gene.

563
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:39,220
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

564
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:41,393
You can't find any of his firm?

565
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:44,029
Maybe this Dragan geezer's
already found the Duke...

566
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,698
...and done the business.

567
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:50,062
Yeah, well, there is someone
I can call. Keep looking.

568
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:53,433
Wait. You're gonna leave it to us?

569
00:45:53,674 --> 00:45:57,041
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

570
00:45:57,244 --> 00:46:02,443
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

571
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,950
<i>- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.</i>

572
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,597
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.

573
00:46:16,798 --> 00:46:19,789
<i>- You sound sleepy. Just woken up?
- Not long ago.</i>

574
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,494
<i>- So when am I gonna see you?
- What are you doing now?</i>

575
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:29,803
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

576
00:46:32,914 --> 00:46:35,280
<i>- You still in bed?
- Yeah.</i>

577
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:41,148
You lying there naked?

578
00:46:41,356 --> 00:46:45,690
<i>I've got a little T-shirt on.
But that's all.</i>

579
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:48,192
<i>Here, wait, listen to this.</i>

580
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:52,990
What's that?

581
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:56,534
<i>I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.</i>

582
00:46:56,738 --> 00:47:00,732
<i>Did you like it?
My, oh, my, it's fresh this morning.</i>

583
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:07,473
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

584
00:47:07,683 --> 00:47:11,313
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?

585
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:13,715
I'll book a table for lunch.
St. Martin's Hotel.

586
00:47:13,922 --> 00:47:17,449
Don't worry about a table.
We'll have room service.

587
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:19,752
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- One hour.</i>

588
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:57,927
Hang on.

589
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,271
Oh, shit.

590
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,204
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

591
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:51,414
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

592
00:48:51,623 --> 00:48:53,148
Not round here, I hope.

593
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,853
No, over by Greenwich market. So
you can relax. It's just the two of us.

594
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:10,908
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

595
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:15,345
Stay put.

596
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:34,199
Come on.

597
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:40,370
Hello, it's me. It's me.
Shut up and listen.

598
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,738
Duke's nephew is working down by
Greenwich Market. Go and look.

599
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,912
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

600
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,548
Okay.

601
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:01,823
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

602
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:30,491
One moment, Mr. Troop.

603
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:33,787
I want to hear what this bastard
has to say for himself.

604
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:50,112
I'm Jimmy's old colleague,
Eddie Temple.

605
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,972
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

606
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,617
Hunt her down
like some lost mongrel.

607
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,146
He said you asked for his help.

608
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:07,820
Mr. Troop could find anyone
on the planet in 10 minutes flat.

609
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:13,833
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

610
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,005
You'd join that shit, Kinky...

611
00:51:16,178 --> 00:51:19,443
...who thought he could take
my 5 grand and fuck me over.

612
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:25,251
The audacity.
How fucking dare you?

613
00:51:25,454 --> 00:51:28,982
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

614
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:31,888
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

615
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,590
Do you know what a remora fish is?

616
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:40,892
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

617
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:46,632
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

618
00:51:46,943 --> 00:51:50,846
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

619
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:54,347
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

620
00:51:54,551 --> 00:51:57,849
But you keep
very, very bad company.

621
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:04,621
You know, I host a charity
golf tournament every year.

622
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:07,956
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

623
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:13,626
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my
friends find him absurdly hilarious.

624
00:52:13,937 --> 00:52:16,736
Drinks are on me.
Drinks for everyone.

625
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:19,807
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

626
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:26,007
But I've come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

627
00:52:26,217 --> 00:52:29,243
<i>Jimmy, as usual
on the lookout for tidbits...</i>

628
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:33,652
<i>... has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.</i>

629
00:52:33,858 --> 00:52:36,520
<i>They're trawling the West
for investments.</i>

630
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:41,688
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

631
00:52:41,933 --> 00:52:45,631
<i>They've sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.</i>

632
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:51,003
<i>Profits, shares, long-term
investments, short-term investments.</i>

633
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,735
<i>They've even made him
an honorary citizen.</i>

634
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:57,506
Even made him one of the tribe.

635
00:52:57,882 --> 00:53:01,842
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears...

636
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:05,046
...was that the hardline
communist insurgents...

637
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:08,420
<i>... who control the country
outside the mining areas...</i>

638
00:53:08,627 --> 00:53:13,155
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.
The communists have broken through.

639
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:15,766
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

640
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:18,096
What the fuck are you on about?

641
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:20,499
<i>I got word they were
planning a push.</i>

642
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,902
The final coup de grâce.
I told Jimmy.

643
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,940
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

644
00:53:25,144 --> 00:53:28,808
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

645
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:32,576
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

646
00:53:32,786 --> 00:53:37,280
I explained that wasn't possible. We
thought we'd bought a government.

647
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:40,154
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

648
00:53:40,361 --> 00:53:41,952
You win some, you lose some.

649
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:44,390
How much are we talking?

650
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,395
It's only a cheeky half-mil, Jim.

651
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,059
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

652
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:53,433
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen what?

653
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,705
- Thirteen million pounds. I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

654
00:53:59,914 --> 00:54:04,317
Thirteen million pounds!

655
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:08,046
How could you be
so fucking stupid?

656
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:10,757
You've been right grafted,
royally turned over.

657
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,086
Like some Yank buying
London Bridge.

658
00:54:13,294 --> 00:54:14,886
Don't talk to me like that.

659
00:54:15,129 --> 00:54:17,030
He accused me of instigating it.

660
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:19,733
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

661
00:54:19,934 --> 00:54:21,835
Are you fucking demented?

662
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:24,266
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister...

663
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:28,102
...still parked up in La Maison Grande,
still eating well.

664
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:33,270
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

665
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,472
Jimmy thought he'd keep
Charlotte hostage...

666
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:37,515
...while you went to get his money.

667
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:42,713
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

668
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:44,119
I'm sorry, what?

669
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:47,420
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

670
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:52,089
If I find you trying to find her,
I do his dirty work.

671
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:57,465
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

672
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:02,435
I've found out something
very interesting about Jimmy...

673
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:04,408
...something I've long suspected.

674
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:11,353
But I'll let Jimmy explain.

675
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:13,988
You follow me.

676
00:56:02,706 --> 00:56:03,901
You've no doubt suffered...

677
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:07,909
...Jimmy's "CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

678
00:56:08,113 --> 00:56:09,774
The other chap's Albert Carter.

679
00:56:09,981 --> 00:56:12,883
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood.

680
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:17,419
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax, enjoy.

681
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:20,284
<i>It ain't like your lot in the old days.</i>

682
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:23,291
<i>- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.</i>

683
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:27,364
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

684
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:33,197
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- That's the going rate, Jim.

685
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,636
<i>Ten K. Hardly seems
worth the bother.</i>

686
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:42,474
<i>Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.</i>

687
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:48,948
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

688
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:53,922
<i>What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...</i>

689
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:56,357
...is too loyal for his own good.

690
00:56:58,364 --> 00:57:01,357
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

691
00:57:01,568 --> 00:57:05,026
- Because it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

692
00:57:05,606 --> 00:57:07,403
Mr. Troop made it for me.

693
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,877
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

694
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:16,743
Don't you wanna hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

695
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:22,217
<i>I've got one for you.
Plucked and ready for the pot.</i>

696
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:25,988
- Just give us a name, and he's gone.
- In time.

697
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,027
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.

698
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:33,098
<i>Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?</i>

699
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:37,362
<i>Reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement.</i>

700
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:40,268
<i>I want him away for 12.</i>

701
00:57:40,475 --> 00:57:43,933
<i>If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.</i>

702
00:57:44,145 --> 00:57:46,841
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

703
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:50,018
He's got a few quid.
He'll come in handy.

704
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:54,348
<i>I set him up with that slippery
accountant in the first place.</i>

705
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,956
<i>Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?</i>

706
00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:01,491
<i>"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr. Price. "</i>

707
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:06,566
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

708
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:09,966
You'd no idea what
Jimmy was up to?

709
00:58:10,172 --> 00:58:12,697
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

710
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:17,208
I would've thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

711
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:20,940
- Can I have that?
- Mr. Troop.

712
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,744
Thank you.

713
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:32,017
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

714
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:36,027
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

715
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:39,201
<i>Opera tonight.
The Damnation of Faust.</i>

716
00:58:39,402 --> 00:58:42,496
Man sells his soul to the devil.
All ends in tears.

717
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:44,367
These arrangements usually do.

718
00:58:54,684 --> 00:58:57,210
One more thing, young man.

719
00:58:57,421 --> 00:59:01,255
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

720
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:03,517
Bye-bye.

721
00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:34,719
Fuck!

722
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:03,098
<i>- I've got him.
- Got who?</i>

723
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,362
Sidney, remember?
Yellow Range Rover?

724
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,470
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

725
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,505
Good. Tell Morty.

726
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:19,201
- So, what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

727
01:06:33,258 --> 01:06:36,750
<i>Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.</i>

728
01:06:36,962 --> 01:06:40,056
<i>If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.</i>

729
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:45,430
Dragan, I've been doing
some checking.

730
01:06:45,637 --> 01:06:47,731
<i>- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.</i>

731
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:50,670
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

732
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:52,777
<i>- Come to my hotel...
- Look...</i>

733
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:55,811
...l'd rather meet you
in a public place.

734
01:06:56,014 --> 01:07:00,144
<i>You have nothing to fear.
I'm a reasonable man.</i>

735
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:03,049
That's not what I've heard.

736
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:05,620
I'll meet you at...

737
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:11,690
I'll meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

738
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:14,696
<i>- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.</i>

739
01:07:14,901 --> 01:07:18,803
<i>- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.</i>

740
01:07:19,505 --> 01:07:21,905
<i>I'll be there.</i>

741
01:07:26,413 --> 01:07:28,973
That's rude, Mr. Dragan.

742
01:07:40,928 --> 01:07:42,829
Condition's red down there, pal.

743
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:47,230
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lockup.

744
01:07:47,435 --> 01:07:50,335
Have a look at the geezer
at the front, on the door.

745
01:07:53,408 --> 01:07:56,308
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

746
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,604
What about the blokes in red?

747
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:01,042
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

748
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:04,116
The lorries come in one color,
go out another.

749
01:08:04,386 --> 01:08:06,616
But they're nothing to do
with the Duke.

750
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:09,346
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

751
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:14,083
It doesn't matter. I've got work to do.

752
01:08:14,296 --> 01:08:17,527
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

753
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:20,964
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean "night"?

754
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:25,129
- I've been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

755
01:08:46,762 --> 01:08:51,131
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

756
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:55,498
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

757
01:08:55,705 --> 01:08:59,835
I'm in the best of health, Mr. Temple.
Thank you for asking.

758
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:03,035
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.

759
01:09:03,246 --> 01:09:06,477
<i>- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.</i>

760
01:09:06,683 --> 01:09:09,743
No wonder it took him
60 years to write it.

761
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:11,944
How's the family?

762
01:09:12,155 --> 01:09:14,123
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

763
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:17,487
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

764
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:19,889
Being a clever bastard, are we?

765
01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:23,965
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.

766
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:27,898
Then we'll have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

767
01:09:34,445 --> 01:09:37,414
<i>I've been thinking, after
our chat the other day.</i>

768
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:41,073
Your pills. How much for the lot?

769
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:45,386
No, I've already got a buyer.

770
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:48,321
<i>Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.</i>

771
01:09:48,527 --> 01:09:51,290
I told you, lah. I'm still thinking.

772
01:09:51,496 --> 01:09:54,795
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

773
01:09:54,999 --> 01:09:57,662
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

774
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,360
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

775
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,438
They've got history.

776
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:05,836
Bad juju.

777
01:10:06,043 --> 01:10:10,208
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

778
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:15,582
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely...

779
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:21,056
I did you a big fucking favor
letting you know about Jimmy.

780
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:23,660
I think you owe me.

781
01:10:25,265 --> 01:10:28,893
Two and a half million in sterling and
euros, high-denomination used notes.

782
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:33,401
So if I gave you 3 million,
that would keep everyone happy.

783
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:35,665
Let me state my position.

784
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:39,077
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

785
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,680
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

786
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:45,146
But I'll tell you...

787
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:50,584
...l'll be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell them to me.

788
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,986
You understand?

789
01:10:57,765 --> 01:11:01,097
Okay, Mr. Temple.
Three million. Done.

790
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:06,468
- My buyer's not gonna be happy.
- Fuck him. He'll get over it.

791
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:18,008
I'm gonna need some help.

792
01:11:19,153 --> 01:11:23,283
Someone who can eliminate the
problem. Someone who's a bit handy.

793
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,359
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

794
01:11:28,662 --> 01:11:31,223
Mr. Lucky does a drop
of freelance work.

795
01:11:32,033 --> 01:11:35,662
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

796
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:39,965
You tell him when,
and he'll come down on the train.

797
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,204
Thanks, Trev.

798
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:46,510
Excuse me.

799
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:52,547
Mr. Temple.

800
01:11:53,356 --> 01:11:57,417
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

801
01:11:57,627 --> 01:12:00,061
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

802
01:12:00,263 --> 01:12:02,754
Tuesday? I'm paying
over the odds, remember?

803
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:06,833
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

804
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:23,051
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

805
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:27,451
Yeah, everything's under control.

806
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:34,887
- Cody's been chasing his 10 grand.
- Yeah. I'll call him later.

807
01:12:40,237 --> 01:12:42,865
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

808
01:12:43,073 --> 01:12:44,734
Oh, yeah? What's that?

809
01:12:45,342 --> 01:12:48,072
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

810
01:12:48,278 --> 01:12:51,873
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

811
01:12:53,985 --> 01:12:56,544
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

812
01:12:56,753 --> 01:13:00,087
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

813
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:02,589
- Open the fucking door!
- Why?

814
01:13:04,162 --> 01:13:06,629
Open the fucking door!

815
01:13:11,135 --> 01:13:14,832
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

816
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,774
Listen to me, Morty. I got a call
from a cozzer we've got bent.

817
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,413
They found Jimmy's body last night.

818
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:26,414
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

819
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:29,086
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

820
01:13:29,287 --> 01:13:32,155
All right, look. Here. We'll see.

821
01:13:32,358 --> 01:13:34,018
Read it. Read it out loud.

822
01:13:34,225 --> 01:13:38,356
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

823
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:41,158
Read the fucking ballistics report.

824
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:45,360
"Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

825
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:47,334
One recovered cartridge casing."

826
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:51,771
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

827
01:13:51,977 --> 01:13:54,003
"...consistent with weapon used...

828
01:13:54,214 --> 01:13:59,652
...in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower a.k.a. Crazy Larry Flynn."

829
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:04,756
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.

830
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,985
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

831
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,891
The one he stole from my flat.

832
01:14:12,098 --> 01:14:16,729
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

833
01:14:16,937 --> 01:14:20,667
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

834
01:14:26,313 --> 01:14:29,406
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

835
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:31,107
He was a police informer!

836
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:34,616
Jimmy a grass?
Are you fucking mad?

837
01:14:34,855 --> 01:14:38,382
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.

838
01:14:38,592 --> 01:14:42,084
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

839
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:47,563
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

840
01:14:47,768 --> 01:14:51,761
If he's lying,
we'll both fucking kill him.

841
01:14:51,972 --> 01:14:53,998
<i>Mr. Mortimer reckons...</i>

842
01:14:54,209 --> 01:14:59,875
<i>... the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.</i>

843
01:15:00,082 --> 01:15:03,518
<i>They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.</i>

844
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:07,815
<i>I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.</i>

845
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:12,858
<i>Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?</i>

846
01:15:13,395 --> 01:15:16,991
<i>What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?</i>

847
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,225
<i>What? About me
working for the old firm?</i>

848
01:15:22,538 --> 01:15:24,630
Convinced?

849
01:15:29,077 --> 01:15:31,376
You don't fuck about, do you?

850
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,546
Jimmy was skint, huh?

851
01:15:40,757 --> 01:15:44,090
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

852
01:15:48,264 --> 01:15:52,667
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

853
01:15:52,869 --> 01:15:54,895
Really?

854
01:15:57,473 --> 01:15:59,669
Why did you kill Larry?

855
01:16:02,745 --> 01:16:05,613
Funny enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

856
01:16:06,582 --> 01:16:08,517
<i>Jimmy never liked Larry.</i>

857
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,280
Look at that wrong one waving
his money around. It ain't right.

858
01:16:13,223 --> 01:16:15,783
Hey, I love you, man.

859
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:21,523
He saw the future was drugs and
it needed to be run like a business.

860
01:16:21,733 --> 01:16:23,962
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

861
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:26,729
<i>After that business
with Kilburn Jerry...</i>

862
01:16:26,938 --> 01:16:31,170
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

863
01:16:31,376 --> 01:16:33,935
...he wanted him gone.

864
01:16:36,881 --> 01:16:39,873
<i>I didn't have any problem
doing him.</i>

865
01:16:44,255 --> 01:16:46,553
That's why I did it.

866
01:16:46,758 --> 01:16:49,057
But why did you keep the gun?

867
01:16:49,261 --> 01:16:52,991
Sounds silly now,
but it was me favorite.

868
01:16:54,266 --> 01:16:57,564
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you've got favorites.

869
01:17:03,509 --> 01:17:06,069
So, what's the next move, boss?

870
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:12,548
Well, I'm going to bed.

871
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:16,812
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

872
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:51,990
Sorry?

873
01:17:55,396 --> 01:17:58,832
Sorry, mate, what was that?

874
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:02,195
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week.

875
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:05,372
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.
I was just saying...

876
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:23,185
So when does the target
get here, then?

877
01:18:23,391 --> 01:18:26,919
The target? The target's gonna
be here at exactly midday.

878
01:18:27,129 --> 01:18:29,619
- Where?
- Here, right fucking here.

879
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:30,819
Got a photo?

880
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:32,830
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

881
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:36,163
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.

882
01:18:36,371 --> 01:18:39,704
I could get the 10 past 1
home from here.

883
01:18:39,907 --> 01:18:41,739
Let's have a little recce.

884
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:46,080
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

885
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:49,011
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

886
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:51,344
Don't run, whatever you do.

887
01:18:51,553 --> 01:18:54,887
The first 5 minutes,
nobody'll have a clue what's going on.

888
01:18:55,091 --> 01:18:58,116
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.

889
01:19:02,431 --> 01:19:04,992
So try to stay relaxed.

890
01:19:05,935 --> 01:19:09,427
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

891
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:11,539
Or me.

892
01:19:11,741 --> 01:19:16,201
Afterwards, take me to
the Underground station.

893
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:17,744
I'll look after myself.

894
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:22,950
There.

895
01:19:25,088 --> 01:19:27,148
Time?

896
01:19:28,993 --> 01:19:31,461
Six minutes to 12.

897
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:36,857
I hope he's not gonna be late.

898
01:19:40,537 --> 01:19:43,836
- Maybe he'll be early.
- That'd be nice.

899
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:57,820
Can you see that guy on the left?

900
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:08,497
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

901
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:14,936
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I'm gonna call him.

902
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:18,601
It's up to you. You're the client.

903
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:27,714
As soon as he answers,
he's gone, okay?

904
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,511
Okey-dokey.

905
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:35,382
Stand by.

906
01:20:39,632 --> 01:20:41,293
Now.

907
01:20:42,668 --> 01:20:46,695
<i>Hello, may I help you?</i>

908
01:20:48,374 --> 01:20:53,368
<i>Don't move a muscle.</i>

909
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:57,943
<i>- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.</i>

910
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:03,611
<i>You English, you have no idea
of honor and respect.</i>

911
01:21:03,824 --> 01:21:09,922
<i>I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duke.</i>

912
01:21:10,163 --> 01:21:13,223
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.

913
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:18,996
<i>Don't piss in my pocket
and tell me it's raining.</i>

914
01:21:19,206 --> 01:21:20,935
<i>Now listen for the last time.</i>

915
01:21:21,174 --> 01:21:25,907
<i>- You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!</i>

916
01:21:26,113 --> 01:21:29,913
<i>You have one more day.</i>

917
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:33,050
<i>See you tomorrow at dusk
by the statue.</i>

918
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:37,213
<i>Remember, I will be watching you.</i>

919
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,261
What the fuck were you thinking?

920
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,831
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

921
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:58,609
Trevor's gonna go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

922
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,146
- What a fucking mess.
- You've gone mad.

923
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,180
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

924
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:05,683
You wanna play?
You do it somewhere else.

925
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:09,324
If you do it near me,
I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.

926
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,451
Stick to your fucking sums.

927
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,688
Listen. Listen to me.

928
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:18,163
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

929
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:21,962
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

930
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:24,662
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

931
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:29,174
- I wish.
- Fuck off! Could be you or Morty.

932
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:36,073
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

933
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:42,557
What?

934
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:48,024
I should've told you this earlier.

935
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:51,997
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

936
01:22:52,202 --> 01:22:54,670
Paul the boatman was topped
last night.

937
01:22:54,872 --> 01:22:57,362
I've gotta get on my toes sharpish.

938
01:22:57,574 --> 01:23:00,203
I want Jimmy brought here
right now, yeah?

939
01:23:00,411 --> 01:23:04,905
Getting that smug yuppie bastard to
tell Duke those pills were useless...

940
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:07,379
...after sending us over
in the first place.

941
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:09,519
Hang on, you've lost me now.

942
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:14,350
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.

943
01:23:14,558 --> 01:23:17,220
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law.

944
01:23:17,428 --> 01:23:19,419
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

945
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:22,463
Shut the fuck up!

946
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,517
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

947
01:23:43,755 --> 01:23:46,553
You're not in there
because I like you.

948
01:23:49,094 --> 01:23:51,427
I'm beginning to feel left out.

949
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:53,154
Why?

950
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:55,926
Freddie Hurst is still
in intensive care...

951
01:23:56,135 --> 01:23:59,764
...after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

952
01:23:59,972 --> 01:24:02,202
Fucking hell, Duke.

953
01:24:02,408 --> 01:24:04,899
For once, you might be of some use.

954
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:25,757
That was Gazza on the phone.
It's on.

955
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:29,663
He'll pick you up at 9 in the
morning. Gallows Corner. Know it?

956
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:31,234
Yeah.

957
01:24:32,472 --> 01:24:35,770
With Jimmy gone, these pills
will make a nice contribution...

958
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:40,276
...to my retirement fund,
so don't fuck things up again, okay?

959
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,243
If you do...

960
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:46,818
...you'll wish this Dragan had shot you
between the eyes, understand?

961
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:50,047
Best of luck.

962
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,558
Thanks.

963
01:25:16,117 --> 01:25:17,448
Fuck off!

964
01:25:17,652 --> 01:25:21,179
Sidney, I've told you,
stop answering my phone, okay?

965
01:25:21,389 --> 01:25:23,324
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

966
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,491
- What's up, mate?
- Hello, Sidney.

967
01:26:03,699 --> 01:26:07,067
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right. How are you?

968
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:08,930
I'm all right, mate, yeah.

969
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:43,339
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. Fifty pence a pill.

970
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:45,771
That way, we all come out
with something.

971
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:51,347
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

972
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,451
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

973
01:26:55,654 --> 01:26:58,554
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from...

974
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:01,351
...they'd kill you like
you'd take a piss.

975
01:27:03,794 --> 01:27:06,423
Gazza, the old bill are outside!

976
01:27:07,566 --> 01:27:09,625
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

977
01:27:10,669 --> 01:27:12,933
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

978
01:27:13,138 --> 01:27:15,299
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

979
01:27:15,507 --> 01:27:19,274
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're gonna get us all shot.

980
01:27:20,412 --> 01:27:22,471
Fuck it! Boat!

981
01:27:43,503 --> 01:27:45,471
Stay there!

982
01:27:56,817 --> 01:27:58,784
Fuck!

983
01:28:04,457 --> 01:28:06,119
Come on!

984
01:28:14,601 --> 01:28:17,968
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

985
01:28:18,171 --> 01:28:19,799
Get in.

986
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:11,489
Is this for me?

987
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:17,157
Yes.

988
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:28,108
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.

989
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:31,336
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

990
01:29:31,547 --> 01:29:34,847
- How do you know?
- I watched.

991
01:29:35,051 --> 01:29:38,612
I don't believe this.
Cox's gonna go fucking spare!

992
01:29:38,822 --> 01:29:42,154
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

993
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:44,987
Oh, fucking hell.

994
01:29:45,462 --> 01:29:48,056
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox...

995
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:51,324
...that his suspect has scarpered
because of your blundering.

996
01:29:51,534 --> 01:29:53,968
Knobheads. Helmets off.

997
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,407
Does this settle things, then?

998
01:30:26,037 --> 01:30:28,505
<i>Tango Foxtrot, over.</i>

999
01:30:28,707 --> 01:30:31,300
<i>Delta Uniform.</i>

1000
01:30:39,284 --> 01:30:41,149
How did that other errand go?

1001
01:30:41,386 --> 01:30:44,412
Success, as far as I could make out.

1002
01:30:47,926 --> 01:30:50,394
Where is my fucking prisoner?

1003
01:30:50,595 --> 01:30:53,393
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

1004
01:30:53,598 --> 01:30:56,397
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

1005
01:30:56,602 --> 01:30:59,126
- Go.
- Dingo Bongo.

1006
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,967
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

1007
01:31:03,176 --> 01:31:04,802
You can fuck off, then.

1008
01:31:05,778 --> 01:31:09,179
So where are the pills, genius?

1009
01:31:09,382 --> 01:31:12,044
I think this is them now.

1010
01:31:15,021 --> 01:31:17,581
What the fuck?

1011
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,793
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

1012
01:31:26,265 --> 01:31:29,235
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

1013
01:31:29,436 --> 01:31:33,532
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

1014
01:31:33,741 --> 01:31:37,073
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

1015
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:15,314
Hello.

1016
01:32:16,684 --> 01:32:20,950
Okay. Yes, it will do. Bye-bye.

1017
01:32:24,827 --> 01:32:28,626
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

1018
01:32:32,133 --> 01:32:33,965
Good news.

1019
01:32:35,037 --> 01:32:37,527
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

1020
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:40,072
Listen, I've got one for you.

1021
01:32:40,276 --> 01:32:42,709
Irishman caught his son
snorting charlie.

1022
01:32:42,912 --> 01:32:46,541
He said, "If I catch you doing that
again, I'll rub your fucking nose in it."

1023
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:16,069
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

1024
01:33:17,881 --> 01:33:20,214
Boss wants to see you in his office.

1025
01:33:28,992 --> 01:33:31,484
Come in. Sit down.

1026
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:39,392
Here you are. Payment.

1027
01:33:51,415 --> 01:33:55,283
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

1028
01:33:55,519 --> 01:34:01,789
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

1029
01:34:02,027 --> 01:34:05,257
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

1030
01:34:05,463 --> 01:34:09,491
I'm keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

1031
01:34:09,701 --> 01:34:14,229
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.

1032
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:18,239
The amount of trouble
you've caused the last few days.

1033
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:20,378
Jimmy.

1034
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,604
Poor little Jimmy.

1035
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:25,078
It would be in your interests...

1036
01:34:25,285 --> 01:34:28,742
...if this thing finishes here,
now, today. Understand?

1037
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:33,816
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are gonna come after you.

1038
01:34:34,861 --> 01:34:38,261
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country...

1039
01:34:38,463 --> 01:34:41,490
...looking for revenge. Look at them.

1040
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:45,728
Bunch of underendowed,
aging fuck-pigs.

1041
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:47,372
Are you enjoying this?

1042
01:34:47,573 --> 01:34:50,701
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

1043
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52,902
You're a bright young man.

1044
01:34:53,113 --> 01:34:55,910
This monkey business is
in your blood, under your skin.

1045
01:34:56,115 --> 01:35:00,449
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I've every faith in you.

1046
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:04,146
One day, it will be you sitting here...

1047
01:35:04,358 --> 01:35:07,555
...telling some Young Turk
the facts of life.

1048
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:11,625
And they are, Mr. Temple?

1049
01:35:18,405 --> 01:35:21,340
You're born, you take shit.

1050
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:24,841
Get out in the world,
you take more shit.

1051
01:35:25,046 --> 01:35:29,277
Climb a little higher,
you take less shit.

1052
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:32,280
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere...

1053
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:34,920
...and you've forgotten
what shit even looks like.

1054
01:35:37,891 --> 01:35:40,360
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

1055
01:35:57,078 --> 01:36:00,343
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

1056
01:36:00,949 --> 01:36:03,748
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

1057
01:36:04,186 --> 01:36:07,451
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

1058
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:09,221
Good night.

1059
01:36:42,859 --> 01:36:44,724
<i>If you're gonna hang around
in this game...</i>

1060
01:36:44,928 --> 01:36:46,759
<i>... that's where you've
got to aim to be.</i>

1061
01:36:46,963 --> 01:36:51,024
<i>In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work...</i>

1062
01:36:51,234 --> 01:36:53,362
<i>... while you deliver
the suspect lecture...</i>

1063
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:57,165
<i>... to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.</i>

1064
01:36:58,276 --> 01:37:02,542
<i>The art of good business
is being a good middleman.</i>

1065
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:07,217
<i>Putting people together. I'll always
thank Eddie for telling me that.</i>

1066
01:37:08,586 --> 01:37:11,612
<i>It's all about honor and respect.</i>

1067
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:15,851
This is the end, Mr. Duke,
as I told you.

1068
01:38:00,038 --> 01:38:05,840
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

1069
01:38:06,044 --> 01:38:10,004
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

1070
01:38:11,517 --> 01:38:14,885
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

1071
01:38:15,088 --> 01:38:18,649
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

1072
01:38:18,858 --> 01:38:24,160
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

1073
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:26,356
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1074
01:38:27,267 --> 01:38:31,136
<i>Did I really think Eddie was gonna
give me 3 million for those pills?</i>

1075
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:33,464
<i>Did I fuck.</i>

1076
01:38:33,673 --> 01:38:37,804
<i>But suddenly there was a void
where once there was Jimmy Price.</i>

1077
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:41,413
<i>After a couple days, Eddie's little
"getting in and getting out" speech...</i>

1078
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:45,881
<i>... started to make sense.</i>

1079
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:15,708
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1080
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:18,681
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

1081
01:39:26,095 --> 01:39:27,994
The king is dead.

1082
01:39:28,763 --> 01:39:30,527
Long live the king.

1083
01:39:35,504 --> 01:39:37,267
Well, I'm honored.

1084
01:39:39,407 --> 01:39:42,844
But for me this is all over.
I'm getting out.

1085
01:39:43,045 --> 01:39:45,275
What was true then is true now.

1086
01:39:46,182 --> 01:39:49,481
Have a plan. Stick to it.

1087
01:39:49,685 --> 01:39:52,415
So I'm sure you must have
lots to discuss...

1088
01:39:52,622 --> 01:39:54,886
...but I have no business being here.

1089
01:39:57,093 --> 01:39:59,221
I've got someone to meet.

1090
01:40:01,464 --> 01:40:03,057
Adios, amigos.

1091
01:40:12,743 --> 01:40:14,506
<i>Paul the boatman.</i>

1092
01:40:14,711 --> 01:40:16,201
<i>Kinky.</i>

1093
01:40:16,413 --> 01:40:17,710
<i>The Duke.</i>

1094
01:40:17,914 --> 01:40:19,677
<i>Slasher.</i>

1095
01:40:19,883 --> 01:40:21,476
<i>Kilburn Jerry.</i>

1096
01:40:21,686 --> 01:40:23,346
<i>Crazy Larry.</i>

1097
01:40:23,553 --> 01:40:25,282
<i>Mr. Lucky.</i>

1098
01:40:25,489 --> 01:40:27,219
<i>Troop.</i>

1099
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,183
<i>Jimmy.</i>

1100
01:40:31,963 --> 01:40:34,362
<i>I don't want to add my name
to that list.</i>

1101
01:40:37,201 --> 01:40:40,329
My name? If you knew that,
you'd be as clever as me.

1102
01:40:40,538 --> 01:40:42,506
No!

1103
01:40:46,744 --> 01:40:48,974
I'm sorry.
