1
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,897
Hello? (Subtitle Revised by HchC)

2
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,778
What do you look like?

3
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,618
Talk louder!

4
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,494
I can't hear you!

5
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,246
Hey, hello!

6
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,957
Hello! I can't hear you!

7
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,139
Five.

8
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,688
I don't know.

9
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,984
I don't know.

10
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:48,556
Get her in focus! Here I come!

11
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:56,937
Open up! Shit!

12
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:08,113
Jesus H. Christ!
What are you--?

13
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:13,702
What happened?

14
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,126
Now he's got pressure.
He has a receiver!

15
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:28,047
When it's time to relax

16
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,716
One beer stands clear

17
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,301
Oh, damn it!

18
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:47,146
Tweety?

19
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,615
Oh, shit, Tweety! Couldn't you
have waited for a school day?

20
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:08,581
Won't you please

21
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:10,207
Please won't you be

22
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,459
Who the hell is this guy?

23
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,878
What the hell's going on?

24
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:20,008
Freeling, what's goin' on here?

25
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,094
I apologize!
My neighbor's on the same remote!

26
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:28,640
I bet my life on this game!
Are you kiddin' me?

27
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,644
Hi, Ben. We got a good
football game goin' on here.

28
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:36,354
My kids wanna watch
"Mr. Rogers."

29
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:39,983
I don't care what you're watchin'!
Just show some mercy with that thing!

30
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,112
Come on, Steve!

31
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,405
Move your set.

32
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,369
- Move yours, Ben.
- There it is. Don't move.

33
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:59,132
Tweety doesn't like that smell.

34
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:02,010
Sweetheart,
Tweety can't smell a thing.

35
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,720
Put a flower with him.

36
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,763
A flower?

37
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:17,773
For when he's hungry.

38
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:24,320
For when he's lonely.

39
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,032
For when it's nighttime.

40
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,624
Oh, it's okay.

41
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,699
Now I lay me down to sleep...

42
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,909
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

43
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,911
- Oh, brother.
- Stifle it.

44
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,372
If I should die before I wake...

45
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:27,915
It did.

46
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,626
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

47
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:33,253
That was lovely.
Lovely, honey.

48
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,256
Mom, when it rots,
can we dig up the bones?

49
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:40,134
Robbie! Will you come
on down out of the tree?

50
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:41,135
E. Buzz!

51
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:43,846
Can I have a goldfish now?

52
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,977
Come and get it.

53
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,313
Come and get it.

54
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,735
You're overfeeding them.

55
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,737
Tweety Two and Tweety Three
want seconds.

56
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,572
You know what happens
when you overfeed goldfish?

57
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,661
They grow up to be... sharks!

58
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,500
Good night.

59
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,673
Mom, there's a big storm
headed this way.

60
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:18,383
You'll be asleep by the time
it gets here if you hurry.

61
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,927
Come on. In you go.

62
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,765
Good night, sweetie.

63
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,226
Okay, lights out.

64
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,354
Closet light!

65
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,355
My fault.

66
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,899
Turn it on, Mommy!

67
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,531
That enough?

68
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,702
- Okay?
- Good night, Mom.

69
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,369
Night, Mommy.

70
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,543
Good night.

71
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:10,427
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.

72
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,929
You're not crazy, Pete.

73
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:16,140
You mean I'm dead?

74
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,851
I'm--

75
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,522
You mean--
You mean this is for good?

76
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:26,274
Sleepwalking.

77
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:30,110
Nocturnal somnambulism.
You know what?

78
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:33,280
I will bet you anything
it's genetic.

79
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:38,701
I mean, Carol Anne last night
and all last week.

80
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:41,995
And me when I was ten.

81
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,541
- Would you deal with this?
- Sure.

82
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,588
You know...

83
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,884
once I slept-walked four blocks...

84
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,013
and I fell asleep
in the back of this guy's car.

85
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:08,309
He drove all the way to work
before discovering me.

86
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:11,186
God, I woke up,
I started screaming.

87
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:14,272
People came running, called the cops.

88
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:17,776
The cops took
this poor dude downtown.

89
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:21,779
- My father, Ed--
- Big.

90
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,075
Big Ed has me examined
for bruises and hickeys.

91
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,453
God, I was so embarrassed!

92
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:36,332
Oh, shit, Steve.

93
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,918
What if we dig the pool,
you know...

94
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:42,630
and Carol Anne sleepwalks and falls
into it before there's any water?

95
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,798
Oh, honey, no.

96
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:48,677
Have you ever dove off
a three-meter board, sweetheart?

97
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:52,263
- What's three meters?
- It's about ten feet.

98
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:57,059
Let's dig the pool closer to the house
and let the kids jump off the roof.

99
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,644
No, honey, honey, honey.

100
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,523
A three-meter board is like
an air pocket, sweetheart.

101
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:07,359
When you dive off,
it's like free-falling, okay?

102
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,529
You gotta get your feet in position.
Three meters.

103
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,114
Honey, your diving days are over.

104
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:17,242
We're talkin' Olympics,
Diane, okay?

105
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:21,662
Let me see your tuck position.

106
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:25,374
We can jackknife into the swan.

107
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,377
Twist, turn...

108
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,922
and splash!

109
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:37,385
Honey, it's right to
the Nautilus machine.

110
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:40,553
Look at this, honey.
Before, after.

111
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,889
Before, after.
Before, after.

112
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,033
- Don't.
- I love you.

113
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,088
Oh, God, I love it
when you talk dirty!

114
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,341
Storm is coming closer.

115
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:19,511
Hey, partner.

116
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,930
Hi, honey.

117
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,473
Is everything okay?

118
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,978
It's thundering.

119
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,897
Come on. Hop up.

120
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:38,653
I'm the wind and you're the feather.
Say good night to Mom.

121
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:41,113
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.

122
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:47,702
Here we go.

123
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,126
I don't like the tree, Dad.

124
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:01,797
That's an old tree.
It's been around here a long time.

125
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,507
It was here before my company
built the neighborhood.

126
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,509
I don't like its arms.

127
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:10,680
- It knows I live here, doesn't it?
- It knows everything about us.

128
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:13,849
That's why I built the house next to it,
so it could protect us.

129
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:17,227
You and Carol Anne
and Dana and your mom and me.

130
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,438
It's a very wise old tree.

131
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:24,024
It looks at me.
It knows I live here.

132
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,196
I think the storm's gonna pass us.

133
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,863
How do you know?

134
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:33,908
'Cause I can count.

135
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,201
You know what you do?

136
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,578
When you see the lightning...

137
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,998
you count 'til you hear the thunder.

138
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:45,625
If you can count higher each time,
that means the storm's movin' away.

139
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:49,212
Wanna try it?

140
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,131
We need some lightning.

141
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,884
Wait. It's comin'.

142
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:05,142
Okay, count.
One, two, three.

143
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:12,065
Next time, you'll be able to count
to at least four or five. Bet you.

144
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,900
Daddy, it's for you.

145
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,193
Tell them to take
a message, sweet pea.

146
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:18,069
My dad wants to take a message.

147
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,325
Night.

148
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,621
It's too hot.

149
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,790
Okay. Night, angel.

150
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:35,876
- Happy dreams, okay?
- Night, Daddy.

151
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:40,755
One...

152
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,340
two...

153
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,050
three--

154
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:55,059
I did not. Come on!

155
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:58,812
- Good night, Dana.
- Good night, Dad.

156
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,817
- Get off the phone, Dana.
- Okay, Dad.

157
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,491
One...

158
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:13,658
two--

159
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,702
Three...

160
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:16,786
four--

161
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:17,953
Five--

162
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,699
They're here.

163
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:47,129
Listen to me, Jeff.
No, I'm not kidding.

164
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:51,217
I know. How could anybody
sleep through a 6.5?

165
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,303
There was damage. Yeah, the bedroom.
There's stuff in pieces all over.

166
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:01,767
We're listening to the radio.
There's nothing on the radio at all.

167
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,482
You are so obnoxious!
You drive me nuts!

168
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,484
Force field.

169
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,487
- You are so obnoxious.
- Got my nose.

170
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,532
This means war, and I mean it!

171
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,161
- Hey, watch out.
- Honey, chew your food ten times.

172
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:27,330
You're a big barf bag.

173
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,540
You're a doggie bag.

174
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,377
- I won't eat it.
- There you go.

175
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:37,797
Sweetheart, last night
when you said, "They're here"--

176
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:40,091
Can I take my goldfish to school?

177
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:44,386
Maybe the fault line runs directly under
our house. Wouldn't that be a scream?

178
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:46,804
The ceiling got crumbs
all over my bed.

179
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:50,766
Remember last night when you woke up
and said, "They're here"?

180
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,811
Who did you mean?
Who's here?

181
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:56,813
The TV people.

182
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:00,107
- She's stoned.
- What do you know?

183
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,818
More than you! Ask Dad!

184
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,528
- "Ask Dad!"
- "Ask Dad!"

185
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:07,405
"Ask Dad!"

186
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:12,659
It's not my mess!

187
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:15,704
Thanks a lot, jerko.
I've got class in 20 minutes.

188
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,290
Give me this
before you cut yourself.

189
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,542
Did the earth move for you?

190
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:24,795
It wasn't quite the same
thing for us, Jeff. Huh?

191
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:28,256
Okay. Yeah, right. Okay.

192
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:33,719
- Give me that before you cut yourself.
- It's not my fault.

193
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:36,138
Bye, sweet pea.
I'm outta here.

194
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,556
- Bye, honey.
- I'm outta here.

195
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,975
- You I can handle.
- I got school.

196
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,728
- Well, breakfast first.
- All right. I'll just flunk.

197
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,126
It happens on every job.

198
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:14,128
Look at this!

199
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,591
I love that swing.

200
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:23,719
I love you. I love you.

201
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:28,473
I love it.

202
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,608
E. Buzz, no, no!
Get down.

203
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:44,904
Carol Anne, I've told you guys
to push your chairs in when you're done.

204
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:52,660
Honey, you're gonna ruin your eyes.
This is not good for you.

205
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:14,971
What's the matter?

206
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:18,682
What are you doing?

207
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:56,089
- How is it?
- Great, Mrs. Freeling.

208
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:59,425
- Okay, Bluto, give me my cup.
- You sure make good coffee.

209
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:19,734
Oh, Jesus!
Don't do that, honey.

210
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:23,862
You wanna see Mommy lying in a cigar box
covered with licorice?

211
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,697
Did you do this?

212
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,327
You guys.

213
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:35,038
I asked you
not to pull the chairs out.

214
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,351
The TV people?

215
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:10,902
Do you see them?

216
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,077
Do you?

217
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,217
I think you're really
gonna enjoy this kitchen.

218
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:43,095
This is our latest development.
We call this phase four.

219
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:45,097
Where do you live, Mr. Freeling?

220
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:49,393
We were the first family to set up house
in the Cuesta Verde Estates.

221
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:50,977
Oh, phase one.

222
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:53,813
We had to pass through
my neighborhood to get here.

223
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,774
Oh, that area with
the lived-in look.

224
00:30:56,816 --> 00:31:00,110
It has that, but in a couple of months
you won't be able to distinguish...

225
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:04,113
phase one from phase three to phase--

226
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,990
We have a saying around here.

227
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,826
"The grass grows greener
on every side."

228
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,289
- That's the way I feel about it.
- I can't tell one house from the other.

229
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,416
I think you're right.

230
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,295
But I think our construction standards
are really very liberal.

231
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,839
I have this neighbor, and he built
his Jacuzzi in his bedroom...

232
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:28,425
and it has a running aqueduct
connected to a wading pool outside.

233
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:31,094
It's built half in
and half out of his living room.

234
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:34,096
It was featured in last month's
issue of "Town and Country."

235
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,432
I'll show you the den.

236
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,741
Honey, come here, quick!

237
00:31:57,867 --> 00:32:01,078
- Hurry, before it stops again!
- But the cans--

238
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:05,623
- Easy.
- All right.

239
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:12,337
Just stand right here, okay?

240
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,883
I've kept Dana and Robbie out of this,
but Carol Anne was here so she knows.

241
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:20,052
Dana would blab, and Robbie
would be up for three weeks.

242
00:32:20,178 --> 00:32:23,055
I think you should sit down.

243
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:26,766
Now just stand, okay?

244
00:32:26,892 --> 00:32:29,435
Now just be calm.

245
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:32,938
Now reach back into our past
when you used to have an open mind.

246
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:34,772
Remember that?

247
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:38,734
Just try to use that
for the next couple of minutes.

248
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,486
- Okay?
- Okay.

249
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:42,904
Mother didn't cook any dinner.

250
00:32:42,947 --> 00:32:45,741
We'll go to Pizza Hut, okay?

251
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,950
Now just look.

252
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,494
Just look. Just watch.

253
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,400
Come here, sweetheart.

254
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:32,279
Honey, could you move
the chair out of the way...

255
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,531
and just stay down there?

256
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:36,700
- Let's show Daddy.
- I'm hungry.

257
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,868
Now don't argue with Mommy.

258
00:33:38,994 --> 00:33:41,245
Let's just do this once.

259
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,540
Okay, here we go.

260
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:47,292
I want pepperoni pizza.

261
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,089
Mommy, that burns.

262
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,259
The floor needs more wax.
Steven, you do it.

263
00:33:57,843 --> 00:33:59,302
Honey, try.

264
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:02,597
It's like there's this tickling...

265
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,599
right in here,
and it starts to pull you.

266
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:08,435
It pulls you, and suddenly
it's like there's no air...

267
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:12,396
except that you can breathe,
and you're getting pulled along--

268
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,607
- Hi, Ben.
- Mr. Tuthill, hi.

269
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:19,319
My TV's not on, so if you're
havin' problems with your set--

270
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:23,198
It's nothing like that.
Diane and I were just wondering--

271
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:26,784
-This will sound strange coming from me.
-I doubt that.

272
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:32,288
The mosquitoes are awful.

273
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,289
They're chowin' down.

274
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,583
I've never been bothered by 'em.

275
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,795
I don't think I've ever
been bitten by one of 'em.

276
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:44,631
As far as I know, nobody in my family's
ever been affected by 'em.

277
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,634
Mosquito ever suck on you, son?

278
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,344
- I don't know, Dad.
- He don't know.

279
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,641
Look.

280
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,106
I'm sorry.

281
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,775
Uh, Mr. Tuthill, look.

282
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,319
We were just--
What we were wondering--

283
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:12,656
Diane, my wife,
and I were wondering, Ben...

284
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:16,033
somethin' funny's
goin' on here next door.

285
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:17,952
Somethin', uh--

286
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:21,663
We were wondering if maybe you had
experienced any disturbances lately.

287
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,541
What kind of disturbances?

288
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,836
Um, oh, you know, like...

289
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:32,547
dishes or furniture
moving around by themselves.

290
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,969
Don't scratch.
You're gonna infect 'em.

291
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,430
Just let me put this on.

292
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,516
- Don't.
- Boy, did I feel like a fool.

293
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:48,269
I'm sorry, but I had to say something.
We were losing blood.

294
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,938
- We'll keep this thing in the family.
- Don't scratch.

295
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,981
Tomorrow I'll call somebody.

296
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:56,526
Who, for instance?
I already looked in the Yellow Pages.

297
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,820
Furniture movers we got.
Strange phenomena, there's no listing.

298
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,741
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

299
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:07,577
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand...

300
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:10,287
five, one thousand--

301
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,372
Honey, look.

302
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:16,418
I lived with this freaky thing all day
and nothing bad happened.

303
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:21,422
It's like another side of nature, a side
that we're not qualified to understand.

304
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:25,758
When you overreact, it makes
what happened much too important.

305
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:28,845
No one's goin' in the kitchen
'til I know what's happening.

306
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,598
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

307
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,892
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand--

308
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:45,900
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three--

309
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,073
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand--

310
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:08,044
Help me!

311
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,778
Help me!

312
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:44,491
- Help me, Dad!
- Be careful!

313
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,351
Dad, come on!

314
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,144
Help me!

315
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:23,524
He's coming!

316
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,151
It's taking me in!

317
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:26,818
- He's coming!
- It's hurting me!

318
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:29,988
- Steven, hurry!
- Dad, help me!

319
00:38:30,114 --> 00:38:32,115
- Hold on!
- Hold on to him!

320
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,051
Hold me, Dad!

321
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:01,473
- I got him!
- My leg!

322
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,725
Dad, my leg!

323
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,435
Help me, Dad!

324
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:17,362
Look, Mom, Dad!
It's a tornado!

325
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:21,198
It must've just skimmed us.
There wouldn't be a house left if--

326
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:25,618
I left her upstairs!

327
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:32,749
Baby, we're coming!

328
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,488
- I'll go check the kitchen.
- No! I'll do it!

329
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:10,489
You check your room.

330
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:29,672
Baby?

331
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:43,934
Sweetheart?

332
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:49,356
Baby?

333
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:02,282
Did you find her?

334
00:41:02,408 --> 00:41:04,993
I've looked everywhere.
This is crazy.

335
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:09,413
Oh, my-- My God.

336
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,126
The swimming pool.

337
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,425
Be careful, honey!

338
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:39,440
Mommy!

339
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:46,028
Nothing!

340
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:54,744
Thank God.

341
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:01,666
What?

342
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,004
Oh, Carol Anne, thank God! Baby!

343
00:42:08,214 --> 00:42:09,923
Baby, where are you?

344
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:16,804
- Mommy, come over here!
- What is it?

345
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:18,888
What, baby?

346
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:26,896
I can't hear you, Mommy.

347
00:42:26,938 --> 00:42:28,897
Where are you?

348
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,115
I can't hear you, Mommy!

349
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,116
Where are you?

350
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:53,251
What members of the household
are involved...

351
00:42:53,252 --> 00:42:55,378
and what are their ages?

352
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,964
There's Diane, my wife.
She's 31.

353
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:01,717
Uh, 32. I'm sorry.

354
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:06,096
My oldest daughter, Dana.
She's 16.

355
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:09,098
My son, Robert, is eight.

356
00:43:13,102 --> 00:43:14,519
Five.

357
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:19,231
Has there been any publicity
about these events?

358
00:43:19,274 --> 00:43:21,233
Absolutely nothing.

359
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:24,694
Can you be reasonably sure...

360
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:27,405
of not letting any get started?

361
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:29,573
That's the last thing we want.

362
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:32,409
We haven't even gone to the police.

363
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:36,537
Would your family welcome...

364
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,875
a serious investigation
of these disturbances...

365
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,419
by someone who can make
firsthand observations?

366
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:48,256
Look, Dr. Lesh,
we don't care about the disturbances--

367
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:52,343
the pounding and the flashing...

368
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:55,553
the screaming, the music.

369
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:00,432
We just want you
to find our little girl.

370
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:14,611
I guess I should warn you that...

371
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:17,989
we keep the room locked off
from the rest of the house.

372
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,496
Robbie's sleeping with us now, and Dana
spends a lot of time with friends.

373
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:30,333
How many disturbances
have you recorded in the room?

374
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,043
We don't go in the room anymore.

375
00:44:35,588 --> 00:44:40,300
Mr. Freeling, we'll record
any psychotropic energy or event.

376
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:44,303
Yes, Ryan photographed an extraordinary
episode on a case in Redlands.

377
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:48,973
That's right. It was a child's toy,
a very small Matchbox vehicle.

378
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:52,101
It rolled seven feet
across a linoleum surface.

379
00:44:52,227 --> 00:44:54,687
The duration of the event
was seven hours.

380
00:44:54,771 --> 00:44:56,689
Seven hours for what?

381
00:44:56,772 --> 00:44:59,357
For the vehicle
to complete the distance.

382
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:03,361
Of course, this would never
register on the naked eye...

383
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:05,904
but I have it recorded
on time-lapse camera.

384
00:45:06,656 --> 00:45:09,116
It's fantastic.

385
00:45:45,563 --> 00:45:49,274
We've been trying to
hold ourselves together as a family.

386
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,692
Of course,
no one's been sleeping much.

387
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:53,986
Steven has missed so much work.

388
00:45:54,112 --> 00:45:57,239
But he's been wonderful.
Really wonderful.

389
00:45:58,574 --> 00:46:01,117
How long have you been
investigating haunted houses?

390
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,869
- Mrs. Freeling--
- Diane.

391
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:09,166
The determination as to whether
your home is haunted is not very easy.

392
00:46:10,418 --> 00:46:12,711
What I meant to say was...

393
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,005
it might very well be
a poltergeist intrusion...

394
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:18,841
instead of a classic haunting.

395
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:22,552
There's a difference?

396
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:24,595
Did you see that?

397
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:27,265
There'll be two more.
They travel in pairs.

398
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:29,141
Dr. Casey.

399
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:35,021
Gotta be quicker than that.

400
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:39,608
It's electrical.
You can smell the charge.

401
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,443
What about poltergeists?

402
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:46,781
Poltergeists are usually
associated with an individual.

403
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:49,742
Haunting seem to be connected...

404
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:53,161
with an area,
a house, usually.

405
00:46:53,204 --> 00:46:56,373
Poltergeist disturbances
have a fairly short duration.

406
00:46:56,498 --> 00:46:58,624
Perhaps a couple of months.

407
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,626
Haunting can go on for years.

408
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:06,923
Are you telling me that all of this
could just suddenly end at any time?

409
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:09,341
Yes, it could.

410
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:11,510
Unless it's a haunting.

411
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:14,346
But haunting don't usually
revolve around living people.

412
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:18,975
Then we don't have much time, because
my daughter is alive in this house.

413
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:22,477
While trying to escape
from an unknown assailant.

414
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,231
Marshall is listed as critical
and under intensive care.

415
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:29,650
This is probably
gonna seem a little strange.

416
00:47:35,698 --> 00:47:38,366
We hear better on this channel.

417
00:47:38,408 --> 00:47:40,409
Don't ask me why.

418
00:47:41,911 --> 00:47:43,537
Well...

419
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,667
I guess I'll call her.

420
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,383
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

421
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,261
We wanna talk to you.

422
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,144
Please answer me, baby.

423
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:15,147
Please answer me.

424
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:18,150
Please talk to me, bunny.

425
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:25,947
Look at the dog.

426
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,704
Are you with us now?

427
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,875
Can you say hello to Daddy?

428
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,717
Hello, Daddy.

429
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,722
Hello, sweet pea.

430
00:48:59,768 --> 00:49:02,144
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

431
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:04,480
Hello, Mommy.

432
00:49:04,564 --> 00:49:06,315
Hello, baby.

433
00:49:09,735 --> 00:49:11,945
Can you see me?

434
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:15,155
Can you see Mommy?

435
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,329
Mommy, where are you?
Where are you?

436
00:49:22,454 --> 00:49:25,665
We're home, baby.
We're home.

437
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,043
- Can you find a way home to us, baby?
- Mommy, where are you?

438
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:32,587
I can't find you!
I can't!

439
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,674
I'm afraid of the light, Mommy!

440
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:38,884
I'm afraid of the light!

441
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:40,510
Tell her to stay away
from the light!

442
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,639
- Maybe it's a way out.
- It is, but not for her.

443
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:48,267
Tell her quickly.

444
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:51,228
- Stay away from the light!
- Tell her, Diane.

445
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,104
Stay away from the light!

446
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,648
The light is dangerous!
Don't go near it!

447
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,067
- Don't even look at the light!
- I don't believe it.

448
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,820
The voice could be coming
from a CB transmitter.

449
00:50:01,904 --> 00:50:03,822
This isn't a hoax!

450
00:50:19,711 --> 00:50:21,670
What the hell is this?

451
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:23,505
Anything?

452
00:50:23,547 --> 00:50:27,592
- Nothing's registered.
- Mommy, there's somebody here.

453
00:50:31,846 --> 00:50:35,390
Mommy, is that you?

454
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,267
No, it's not Mommy.
Who is it, Dr. Lesh?

455
00:50:38,393 --> 00:50:41,145
- Who's with you, baby?
- Who's with you?

456
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,105
Somebody's coming!
Help me, please!

457
00:50:45,107 --> 00:50:47,275
My God! My baby!

458
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:53,113
You bastards!
She's just a baby!

459
00:50:53,155 --> 00:50:56,991
Help her!
Can't you hear what's happening?

460
00:50:57,117 --> 00:50:59,118
Listen!

461
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,037
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

462
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:05,582
Mommy, help me!

463
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:25,891
She just moved through me.

464
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:27,934
My God!

465
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,144
I felt her.

466
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:35,482
I can smell her!

467
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:39,027
It's her!

468
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:41,862
Smell my clothes.
She's all over me.

469
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:43,489
- It's her.
- My God.

470
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,241
It's her. I felt her.

471
00:51:47,576 --> 00:51:49,744
It is. It's her.

472
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:51,203
It is.

473
00:51:51,204 --> 00:51:54,331
It's my baby.

474
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,460
She went through my soul.

475
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:29,361
I can't hear her anymore.
Honey?

476
00:52:32,531 --> 00:52:35,533
Where exactly do you suppose
Carol Anne was playing...

477
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:38,368
when she vanished from sight?

478
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,206
Where was Carol Anne playing
when she disappeared?

479
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,710
Her bedroom closet.

480
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,544
Let's go up there.

481
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:51,713
They won't let you in.

482
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,506
We'll just see about that.

483
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:58,260
Whatever happened to you?

484
00:52:58,261 --> 00:53:01,722
I was just about to check out
the kid's bedroom when-- I don't know.

485
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:03,723
Something took a bite outta me.

486
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,225
You got bit?

487
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:09,686
-That or the world's worst muscle spasm.
-Let's have a look.

488
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:16,400
-Think we'll spend the night downstairs.
-No. Wrong.

489
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,738
Honey, you take Dana and Robbie
and go and spend tonight in town.

490
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,406
I am not leaving here
without Carol Anne.

491
00:53:23,448 --> 00:53:26,283
Mom, Dad, I can't stay here anymore.

492
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:28,702
You go, baby, go.

493
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:31,747
I'm not gonna leave
anybody in this house alone.

494
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:50,763
Can we talk to you?

495
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:52,430
Let's go.

496
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:59,186
- Any movement from those things?
- There's been some ionization flux.

497
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:02,773
I'd like to make sure they're not caused
by humidity from structure leakage...

498
00:54:02,898 --> 00:54:05,483
but I'm not goin' up there
to find out.

499
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,778
We have got much more than the
paranormal episode taking place here.

500
00:54:08,903 --> 00:54:11,613
There is a measurable
physical science in this house...

501
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:15,658
that goes far beyond the creaking doors
or cold spots I've experienced.

502
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:18,786
The voice on television.
Where is it coming from?

503
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:22,873
The absence of a signal on a channel
that is not receiving a broadcast...

504
00:54:22,915 --> 00:54:27,335
means that it can receive a lot of noise
from many things, like short waves.

505
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:30,088
Solar disturbances,
car ignition sparkings.

506
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:33,799
Outer space.
Or inner space.

507
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:39,512
What if these people have an area
of bilocation in their own living room?

508
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:40,971
What do you mean?

509
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:43,098
If that is the way out...

510
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,561
then maybe somewhere in this house
there's a way in.

511
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:59,195
No, please.
Leave it on.

512
00:55:02,865 --> 00:55:04,366
Thanks.

513
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:09,120
You know,
when it's quiet like now...

514
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:12,706
I can imagine how all of this
must look from your side.

515
00:55:12,832 --> 00:55:15,250
I'm really embarrassed.

516
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:17,127
Nonsense.

517
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:20,671
I'm the one who should be embarrassed
being here with you nice people.

518
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:24,675
Parapsychology isn't something
you master in.

519
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:27,260
There are no
certificates of graduation...

520
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:30,555
no licenses to practice.

521
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,390
I am a professional psychologist.

522
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:37,728
I spend most of my time
engaged in this ghostly hobby.

523
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:42,106
Which makes me the most irresponsible
woman of my age that I know.

524
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,861
Would you like a glass for that?

525
00:55:47,903 --> 00:55:49,445
No, thank you.

526
00:55:53,992 --> 00:55:56,410
You know, you were very funny.

527
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:58,995
Your hands were shaking
about a mile a minute.

528
00:56:02,457 --> 00:56:04,458
This isn't over.

529
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:06,919
I'm absolutely terrified.

530
00:56:11,923 --> 00:56:15,050
It's all the things
that we don't understand.

531
00:56:17,762 --> 00:56:20,931
I feel like the protohuman,
coming out of the forest primeval...

532
00:56:21,056 --> 00:56:24,350
and seeing the moon for the first time
and throwing rocks at it.

533
00:56:24,476 --> 00:56:27,853
If I got killed,
would I come back...

534
00:56:27,895 --> 00:56:30,855
and get stuck in the house
like my sister?

535
00:56:30,898 --> 00:56:32,649
Your sister isn't dead, Robbie.

536
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:34,650
If I got killed...

537
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:37,861
could I visit her
and show her how to get back here?

538
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:40,781
You could tie a rope around me
and hold it tight...

539
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:45,326
then somebody could come and get us,
and we could live somewhere else.

540
00:56:47,745 --> 00:56:49,871
Some people believe...

541
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:52,791
that when you die,
your soul goes to heaven.

542
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:54,917
When Grandpa was dead...

543
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:58,629
I looked at him in the hospital bed
and I was watching...

544
00:56:58,629 --> 00:57:01,214
but I didn't see anything
go up out of him.

545
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,467
His soul is invisible, Robbie.
You couldn't see it.

546
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:07,469
But how come Grandpa isn't
on television with Carol Anne?

547
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,557
Some people believe
that when people die...

548
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,500
there's a wonderful light...

549
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:17,627
as bright as the sun...

550
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:20,797
but it doesn't hurt
to look into it.

551
00:57:20,881 --> 00:57:24,468
All the answers to all the questions
that you ever want to know...

552
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,054
are inside that light.

553
00:57:27,096 --> 00:57:31,225
And when you walk to it,
you become a part of it forever.

554
00:57:32,602 --> 00:57:35,062
And then, some people die...

555
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:37,648
but they don't know
that they've gone.

556
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:41,402
They think they're still alive?

557
00:57:44,281 --> 00:57:47,075
Maybe they didn't want to die.

558
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:49,369
Maybe they weren't ready.

559
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:51,370
Maybe they hadn't
lived fully yet...

560
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:55,541
or they'd lived a long time,
but they still wanted more life.

561
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,920
They resist going into that light...

562
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:02,299
however hard the light wants them.

563
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:05,386
They just hang around...

564
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:09,682
watch TV,
watch their friends grow up...

565
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:13,227
feeling unhappy and jealous.

566
00:58:13,269 --> 00:58:16,147
Those feelings are bad.

567
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,941
They hurt.

568
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,112
And then...

569
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:24,448
some people...

570
00:58:24,573 --> 00:58:28,285
just get lost
on the way to the light...

571
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,122
and they need someone
to guide them to it.

572
00:58:32,164 --> 00:58:34,708
So some people get angry...

573
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:37,461
and throw things around,
like in my bedroom?

574
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:42,466
Just like in school.

575
00:58:42,592 --> 00:58:45,178
Like, some kids are nice to you...

576
00:58:45,261 --> 00:58:47,179
some kids are mean.

577
00:58:47,263 --> 00:58:49,932
I got beat up once
by three kids.

578
00:58:50,016 --> 00:58:51,934
They took my lunch money.

579
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:55,313
Maybe they got hit by a truck,
and they're upstairs right now.

580
00:58:55,439 --> 00:58:59,318
Listen, partner, maybe we oughta
get some shut-eye, okay?

581
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,029
You know what?

582
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,198
When we called Grandma tonight...

583
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:07,201
she got really excited that
you're comin' to stay with her...

584
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:11,247
and she's plannin' all these
neat things for you guys to do.

585
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,624
Can I take E. Buzz with me
when we go?

586
00:59:13,624 --> 00:59:15,959
Sure you can.

587
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:18,463
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetie.

588
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:20,172
Night, lady.

589
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,676
Night, Dad.

590
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,178
Night, Rob.

591
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:29,098
I love you.

592
00:59:30,684 --> 00:59:32,811
Good night, Carol Anne.

593
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:33,708
I'm gonna go
get something to eat.

594
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:02,719
What is it?

595
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:21,156
Roll it back.

596
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:28,706
I think we got one.
I think it recorded.

597
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:37,297
Yes. It recorded.

598
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,485
Look at all of them.

599
01:06:57,569 --> 01:06:59,487
Is that our house?

600
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,160
Who are all those people?

601
01:07:06,162 --> 01:07:09,290
They're so alone. So alone.

602
01:07:14,629 --> 01:07:16,631
Where are they coming from?

603
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:19,759
I don't know.

604
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:55,380
Call me, okay?

605
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:03,846
This cameo is over
a hundred years old.

606
01:08:04,973 --> 01:08:06,432
Yeah, some haul, huh?

607
01:08:06,558 --> 01:08:09,978
And this watch is only
a few years old, and it's not yours.

608
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,523
Well, I'm off.

609
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:16,527
I'm taking these back to the lab
along with the tapes.

610
01:08:17,945 --> 01:08:20,697
I'm going to have to
display these, you know.

611
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,743
- Please, not on "60 Minutes."
- Or "That's Incredible!"

612
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:26,746
I'll get it. Excuse me.

613
01:08:46,016 --> 01:08:48,310
I'm leaving Ryan here with you.

614
01:08:49,437 --> 01:08:51,480
Marty won't be coming back.

615
01:08:56,778 --> 01:08:59,030
I am coming back.

616
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:06,162
And I'll bring some help.

617
01:09:06,204 --> 01:09:08,164
Try not to worry.

618
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,920
Thank you.

619
01:09:13,921 --> 01:09:15,923
We've missed you
down at the office.

620
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:20,761
The boys have gotten worried,
so I took it upon myself to--

621
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:24,056
Jesus, Steve, you look like shit.
Aren't you feeling any better?

622
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:27,643
I'm still weak, Mr. Teague.
I've got the flu, I can't get up--

623
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:30,229
Looks like you got
some cable problems here.

624
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:33,398
Yeah. The cable's been off
for a couple of weeks.

625
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:36,527
We'll have to look into that.
The rest of the block dark too?

626
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:39,947
No, just us.

627
01:09:40,073 --> 01:09:43,242
You got some electrical problems
as well here.

628
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:46,913
What have you got screwed in there,
a 300-watt bulb?

629
01:09:46,955 --> 01:09:48,957
You afraid of burglars,
or are you trying to attract...

630
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:50,959
every insect in Cuesta Verde?

631
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:55,506
- Steve, are you happy here?
- Yes, I am, sir.

632
01:09:55,548 --> 01:09:57,675
Forgive me for asking
all these questions...

633
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,636
but we don't want to lose
the best rep we've ever had...

634
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:03,847
to the flu
or other opportunities.

635
01:10:03,973 --> 01:10:06,517
Seeing all that software
in your living room...

636
01:10:06,559 --> 01:10:10,146
makes me wonder, maybe you've
got something going on the side.

637
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:12,690
No, I just read "Popular Mechanics."
I got hobbies.

638
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:14,818
Feel like going
for a little ride?

639
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:16,819
I'd like to show you something.

640
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:09,041
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

641
01:11:11,752 --> 01:11:14,755
One of your children
was born in your house, huh?

642
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:22,096
I understand that she's
missed a lot of school.

643
01:11:22,222 --> 01:11:25,934
One of Trask's daughters
is in the same nursery class.

644
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:28,227
She got the flu as well, huh?

645
01:11:28,228 --> 01:11:30,230
Yeah, we've all got
the same thing.

646
01:11:30,314 --> 01:11:31,481
I'm sorry.

647
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:35,944
- I didn't see her.
- She's around.

648
01:11:35,944 --> 01:11:39,781
I wonder if you'd mind
if I asked you a question.

649
01:11:39,824 --> 01:11:42,243
Are you thinking about
leaving Cuesta Verde?

650
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:47,206
How could anyone in the world
have a problem...

651
01:11:47,248 --> 01:11:49,208
on a day like this?

652
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:54,088
How's that spot
for a bay window?

653
01:11:56,508 --> 01:11:59,094
It's pretty nice if you're
living up here, but...

654
01:12:00,137 --> 01:12:02,097
not so great
down in the valley...

655
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:04,266
Looking at homes
cutting into the hillside.

656
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:06,685
You don't have to live
in the valley anymore.

657
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:09,979
What are you saying?

658
01:12:10,105 --> 01:12:12,691
We're starting phase five
right here where we're standing.

659
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:15,694
All of this can be
your master bedroom suite.

660
01:12:15,736 --> 01:12:18,405
That can be your view.
Interested?

661
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:23,161
Well, Mr. Teague,
that's a generous offer.

662
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:28,040
- I'm just not a developer.
- You're responsible for 42o/o of sales.

663
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:30,460
That's almost half
of everything down there.

664
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:34,005
Almost $70 million worth
of dwelling and properties.

665
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:36,549
That's a whole generation
of security...

666
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:38,843
that nobody
can put a price tag on.

667
01:12:38,885 --> 01:12:43,306
I know we should have made you
a full partner three years ago.

668
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:45,309
I don't want to lose you now.

669
01:12:51,357 --> 01:12:54,902
Not much room
for a pool, is there?

670
01:12:54,986 --> 01:12:57,196
We own all the land.

671
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,324
We've already made arrangements
for relocating the cemetery.

672
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:03,495
You're kidding me.

673
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:07,332
- That's sacrilegious, isn't it?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

674
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:11,044
After all, it's not ancient
tribal burial ground.

675
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,380
It's just... people.

676
01:13:14,673 --> 01:13:16,675
Besides, we've done it before.

677
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,302
When?

678
01:13:19,345 --> 01:13:22,306
In '76. Right down there.

679
01:13:28,062 --> 01:13:29,521
Cuesta Verde?

680
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,483
All 300 acres.
It was quite a deal.

681
01:13:32,525 --> 01:13:34,610
But I never heard
anything about it.

682
01:13:34,652 --> 01:13:37,196
It's not something
one advertises on a billboard...

683
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:39,240
or on the side of a bus.

684
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,493
Don't worry. Friends and relatives
can visit their loved ones...

685
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:44,496
in Broxton Memorial Park.

686
01:13:44,538 --> 01:13:46,540
It's only five minutes further.

687
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:49,375
Oh, yeah. Five minutes.
That's no great hardship.

688
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,380
I suppose that would be okay.

689
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:55,966
Okay with whom?

690
01:13:57,843 --> 01:13:59,386
Whomever might complain.

691
01:14:00,846 --> 01:14:02,848
Nobody's complained until now.

692
01:14:22,744 --> 01:14:26,831
We've had two experiences
in the kitchen. This is the den.

693
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,720
Y'all mind hangin' back?

694
01:14:39,762 --> 01:14:41,722
You're jammin' my frequencies.

695
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:34,944
So... what side of the rainbow
are we working tonight, Dr. Lesh?

696
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:41,076
- This your Knott's Berry Farm solution?
- I know what you're thinking.

697
01:15:41,118 --> 01:15:45,372
But you must take my word for it.
She's cleaned many houses.

698
01:15:45,414 --> 01:15:47,374
Her gifts have been documented--

699
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,711
We haven't heard Carol Anne
since last night.

700
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:51,963
Why is this door locked,
Mr. Freeling?

701
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,678
- Answer her, Steven.
- I am.

702
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,683
I am addressing the living.

703
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,395
I'm sorry.

704
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,855
That's the room
my son and daughter used to occupy.

705
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,941
We believe it's the heart
of the house.

706
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,402
This house has many hearts.

707
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,823
- What is the matter?
- What's the matter?

708
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:23,162
I was trying to answer her
with my mind...

709
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:25,289
and she couldn't hear me.

710
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:28,334
I thought you said this Tangina Barrons
was an extraordinary clairvoyant.

711
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:29,752
I am.

712
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:34,716
I just don't like trick answers.

713
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,893
Come here, honey...

714
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:47,897
and give me your hand.

715
01:16:49,315 --> 01:16:51,275
I'm not gonna bite you.

716
01:17:02,078 --> 01:17:06,040
Come on down here. You'll give me
a whiplash lookin' up at you.

717
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,925
Your daughter is alive
and in this house.

718
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:30,316
Where was the last incident
of bilocation?

719
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,951
I get my strongest feelin'...

720
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:44,372
the point of origin is in
the child's closet upstairs.

721
01:17:45,248 --> 01:17:48,501
Yes. I believe that too.

722
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:53,507
Honey, you're gonna be strong for me
and for your daughter.

723
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:57,261
I can do absolutely nothing
without your faith in this world...

724
01:17:57,303 --> 01:17:59,388
and your love for the children.

725
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:01,974
I will.
Believe me, I will.

726
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:05,727
And will you do anything I ask,
even if it comes contrary...

727
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:08,981
to your beliefs as a human being
and a Christian?

728
01:18:08,982 --> 01:18:11,568
Yes, I promise. Please!

729
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:20,576
Would you all come on in?

730
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:22,704
Gather 'round.

731
01:18:27,459 --> 01:18:29,419
There is no death.

732
01:18:30,713 --> 01:18:36,010
It is only a transition to
a different sphere of consciousness.

733
01:18:36,135 --> 01:18:40,347
Carol Anne is not like those
she's with.

734
01:18:41,724 --> 01:18:44,435
She is a living presence...

735
01:18:44,477 --> 01:18:47,897
in their spiritual earthbound plane.

736
01:18:47,981 --> 01:18:51,860
They are attracted
to the one thing about her...

737
01:18:51,902 --> 01:18:57,032
that is different from themselves--
her life force.

738
01:18:57,074 --> 01:18:59,660
It is very strong.

739
01:18:59,743 --> 01:19:03,163
It gives off
its own illumination.

740
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,666
It is a light that implies life...

741
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,211
and memory of love and home...

742
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,590
and earthly pleasures--

743
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,636
something they
desperately desire...

744
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,764
but can't have anymore.

745
01:19:21,349 --> 01:19:24,685
Right now, she's the closest thing
to that...

746
01:19:25,937 --> 01:19:29,774
and that is
a terrible distraction...

747
01:19:29,816 --> 01:19:33,903
from the real light
that has finally come for them.

748
01:19:35,114 --> 01:19:37,241
Do you understand me?

749
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:46,000
These souls, who for
whatever reason are not at rest...

750
01:19:46,084 --> 01:19:49,504
are also not aware
that they have passed on.

751
01:19:50,713 --> 01:19:54,550
They're not part of consciousness
as we know it.

752
01:19:54,634 --> 01:19:57,929
They linger in
a perpetual dream state...

753
01:19:59,014 --> 01:20:02,100
a nightmare from which
they cannot awake.

754
01:20:03,268 --> 01:20:08,273
Inside the spectral light
is salvation--

755
01:20:09,525 --> 01:20:12,403
a window to the next plane.

756
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:14,571
They must pass through
this membrane...

757
01:20:14,697 --> 01:20:18,951
where friends are waiting
to guide them to new destinies.

758
01:20:20,578 --> 01:20:23,873
Carol Anne must help them
cross over...

759
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:28,837
and she will only hear
her mother's voice.

760
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,466
Now...

761
01:20:34,593 --> 01:20:36,845
hold on to yourselves.

762
01:20:41,058 --> 01:20:43,018
There's one more thing.

763
01:20:44,603 --> 01:20:47,856
A terrible presence
is in there with her.

764
01:20:48,774 --> 01:20:53,195
So much rage.
So much betrayal.

765
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,448
I've never sensed
anything like it.

766
01:20:57,742 --> 01:21:00,870
I don't know
what hovers over this house...

767
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:04,665
but it was strong enough to punch
a hole into this world...

768
01:21:04,749 --> 01:21:06,751
and take your daughter
away from you.

769
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:12,632
It keeps Carol Anne
very close to it...

770
01:21:12,674 --> 01:21:15,051
and away from the spectral light.

771
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:18,514
It lies to her.

772
01:21:18,514 --> 01:21:22,768
It says things
only a child can understand.

773
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:26,313
It has been usin' her
to restrain the others.

774
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:33,362
To her, it simply is
another child.

775
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,536
To us, it is the beast.

776
01:21:54,552 --> 01:21:56,637
Now let's go get your daughter.

777
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:05,563
Red ribbons,
handkerchiefs, tennis balls.

778
01:22:05,647 --> 01:22:07,565
Okay, rope's ready.

779
01:22:07,649 --> 01:22:10,527
- Bathwater?
- I shut it off. It's ready too.

780
01:22:10,568 --> 01:22:13,571
All right. Call to her.

781
01:22:23,457 --> 01:22:25,751
Carol Anne, it's Mommy.
Can you hear me?

782
01:22:30,548 --> 01:22:32,716
Carol Anne,
please tell Mommy hello.

783
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,762
Try again.

784
01:22:38,598 --> 01:22:40,600
Can you say hello to Daddy?

785
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:44,145
Daddy and I miss you so much.

786
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:48,191
So much. We love you so much.

787
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:50,443
Please, just say hello.

788
01:22:50,485 --> 01:22:53,196
- She's under restraint.
- What?

789
01:22:53,322 --> 01:22:56,158
- Who's restraining her?
- There are many arms about her.

790
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:00,913
She thinks it's safe. Who is she more
threatened by, you or your husband?

791
01:23:00,996 --> 01:23:03,915
Neither. Steve decides
the punishment the children--

792
01:23:03,999 --> 01:23:05,917
That's not fair.
I've never laid a hand--

793
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:09,213
Fight about it later.
Steven, make Carol Anne answer you.

794
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:14,468
Be cross with her.

795
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,220
It's Daddy.

796
01:23:16,346 --> 01:23:18,932
Be angry with her,
or you'll never see her again.

797
01:23:19,015 --> 01:23:21,601
Carol Anne, I want you
to answer me.

798
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:24,771
Tell her if she doesn't answer you,
she'll get a spankin'.

799
01:23:24,813 --> 01:23:27,774
- I've never spanked the children.
- Honey, please. Just tell her.

800
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:33,363
Carol Anne,
you answer your parents...

801
01:23:33,489 --> 01:23:35,949
or you're gonna get
a real spanking from the both of us!

802
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:38,076
Mommy! Help me!

803
01:23:39,328 --> 01:23:43,248
- She's away from him.
- From whom? Is she all right?

804
01:23:43,332 --> 01:23:45,250
Diane, ask about the light.

805
01:23:48,212 --> 01:23:50,130
Mommy, help me, please!

806
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:55,219
- Honey, do you see a light?
- Help me, please!

807
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:57,222
Mommy! Help me!

808
01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:00,016
Tell her to go to the light.

809
01:24:01,727 --> 01:24:04,521
They'll follow her. They've been
followin' her for weeks.

810
01:24:04,563 --> 01:24:07,566
- You must do what I say!
- Tell her, Diane.

811
01:24:07,566 --> 01:24:10,569
Mommy, I can't find you!

812
01:24:10,653 --> 01:24:13,572
Run to the light!
Run as fast as you can!

813
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:15,574
- I am in the light!
- No, honey.

814
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,743
- Tell her you are.
- No, it's a lie!

815
01:24:17,869 --> 01:24:21,414
You can't choose between life and death
when dealin' with what is in between.

816
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:23,415
Tell her before it's too late.

817
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,710
Run to the light, baby.

818
01:24:26,753 --> 01:24:29,339
- Mommy is in the light.
- Tell her you're waiting for her.

819
01:24:29,422 --> 01:24:32,675
Mommy is waiting for you in the light.
I hate you for this.

820
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:37,180
Now clear your minds.
It knows what scares you.

821
01:24:37,264 --> 01:24:39,599
It has from the very beginning.

822
01:24:39,683 --> 01:24:42,269
Don't give it any help.
It knows too much already.

823
01:24:43,729 --> 01:24:45,772
Now, open the door.

824
01:25:21,602 --> 01:25:26,356
Ryan, get downstairs
and wait by the target!

825
01:25:29,652 --> 01:25:33,656
Give me the tennis ball
marked number 1 !

826
01:26:09,694 --> 01:26:13,823
Dr. Lesh! It's my handwriting!
It came right out of thin air!

827
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:17,869
The ball came back.
It's his handwriting!

828
01:26:25,711 --> 01:26:27,337
Kiss my ass!

829
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:29,131
Number 2!

830
01:26:30,424 --> 01:26:32,592
Give me your hand!

831
01:26:55,617 --> 01:26:58,495
She's at the mouth
of the corridor!

832
01:26:58,579 --> 01:27:03,208
Tell her to stop!
Tell her not to go into the light!

833
01:27:05,503 --> 01:27:10,466
Listen to me.
Do not go into the light.

834
01:27:10,508 --> 01:27:13,511
Stop where you are.
Turn away from it.

835
01:27:13,636 --> 01:27:15,387
Don't even look at it.

836
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:18,057
Hurry with the rope!

837
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,314
Throw it into the light!

838
01:27:32,364 --> 01:27:34,240
Fantastic.

839
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:36,534
I got it!

840
01:27:37,953 --> 01:27:41,790
Tell him
to take up the slack gently.

841
01:27:41,832 --> 01:27:43,250
Take up the slack!

842
01:27:44,127 --> 01:27:46,087
Take up the slack!

843
01:28:11,989 --> 01:28:14,575
Help me tie this around my waist!

844
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,118
What are you doing?

845
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,288
I'm goin' in after her!

846
01:28:19,414 --> 01:28:22,125
She won't come to you!
Let me go!

847
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:24,960
You've never done this before!

848
01:28:25,003 --> 01:28:26,587
Neither have you!

849
01:28:27,672 --> 01:28:29,674
You're right. You go.

850
01:28:30,675 --> 01:28:32,009
No! Let me!

851
01:28:32,052 --> 01:28:35,180
You can't! Who's strong enough
to stay here and hold the rope?

852
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,752
I love you!

853
01:29:03,793 --> 01:29:08,756
No! Go downstairs
and wait by Ryan...

854
01:29:08,799 --> 01:29:11,468
and pull only when I say so!

855
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:13,470
Only when I say.

856
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,427
Don't let go!

857
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:54,262
Never!

858
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,692
It's coming.

859
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,110
How will we know she's got her?

860
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,114
When will we know?

861
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,007
Cross over, children.

862
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:30,342
All are welcome.

863
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:32,886
All welcome.

864
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:35,013
Go into the light.

865
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,433
You said, "No" !

866
01:30:37,558 --> 01:30:42,146
There is peace and serenity
in the light.

867
01:30:42,272 --> 01:30:44,148
You said don't go into the light!

868
01:30:53,909 --> 01:30:56,036
Steven, not yet!

869
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:16,390
- They're here!
- They're back!

870
01:31:18,393 --> 01:31:20,687
Diane! No, please, no!

871
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:22,480
Get 'em into the water!

872
01:31:22,606 --> 01:31:25,317
- Oh, God!
- No, I'm helping you!

873
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:26,318
Don't worry.

874
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,119
Get 'em in the water.
She's gonna be all right.

875
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:43,920
Come on. Breathe now.

876
01:31:43,961 --> 01:31:47,923
Just take a breath.
Breathe.

877
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:49,842
Breathe. Damn it, breathe!

878
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,097
Breathe!

879
01:31:54,139 --> 01:31:57,017
That's it. Come on.

880
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,978
Come on. Breathe. Yeah.
That's it. Breathe.

881
01:32:10,698 --> 01:32:12,116
Baby.

882
01:32:15,745 --> 01:32:17,246
Sweetheart.

883
01:32:18,873 --> 01:32:22,042
Sweet pea, it's Daddy.
Come on, honey.

884
01:32:22,126 --> 01:32:24,044
Come on, pumpkin.

885
01:32:29,301 --> 01:32:30,594
Hi, Daddy.

886
01:32:50,573 --> 01:32:53,033
This house is clean.

887
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,929
Be careful.

888
01:33:18,394 --> 01:33:20,354
Mom, I'm going to dinner
with Janice and Brian.

889
01:33:20,396 --> 01:33:23,315
- Is your room packed up?
- Everything but the bed.

890
01:33:23,357 --> 01:33:27,361
- Are we gonna sleep here tonight?
- I guess not.

891
01:33:27,403 --> 01:33:31,657
So you better get Brian
to bring you home right after dinner.

892
01:33:31,699 --> 01:33:35,202
Dad wants us to stay
at the Holiday Inn on I-74.

893
01:33:35,245 --> 01:33:37,664
Oh, yeah.
I remember that place.

894
01:33:37,706 --> 01:33:38,790
You what?

895
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:41,835
Are you gonna do anything
about this?

896
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,379
- About what?
- Your new gray?

897
01:33:44,504 --> 01:33:47,423
Oh. You don't like it?

898
01:33:47,508 --> 01:33:49,968
You don't think
it's kind of punk?

899
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:51,678
Bye, Mom.

900
01:33:54,974 --> 01:33:56,392
Honey, I don't know.

901
01:33:58,394 --> 01:34:00,396
Okay, Rob.
That thing almost killed me.

902
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:06,110
You okay?
Don't hurt your back.

903
01:34:07,862 --> 01:34:09,822
How you feelin'?

904
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:11,532
Oh, I'm good.

905
01:34:11,575 --> 01:34:14,119
I feel a little hung over,
like I've been asleep for a few days...

906
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:17,372
but... I feel good, Steven,
I really do.

907
01:34:23,003 --> 01:34:25,005
She doesn't seem
to remember any of it.

908
01:34:28,592 --> 01:34:30,594
Oh, what a day.

909
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:33,139
Smell that mimosa.

910
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:36,434
You better cut a bouquet and
take it with you. We're not stayin'.

911
01:34:36,476 --> 01:34:38,603
I know.

912
01:34:40,897 --> 01:34:42,899
We worked so hard for this.

913
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:46,068
A thousand beautiful memories.

914
01:34:46,152 --> 01:34:49,739
I gotta go to the office, pick up
some stuff, clean up a few things.

915
01:34:49,906 --> 01:34:51,449
I'll be back early.

916
01:34:51,491 --> 01:34:53,367
We're leaving tonight for sure?

917
01:34:53,452 --> 01:34:55,454
Yeah, we are.

918
01:34:55,496 --> 01:34:58,582
If the kids get sleepy,
let 'em sleep 'til I get home.

919
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:00,876
How's Teague taking it?

920
01:35:00,918 --> 01:35:03,587
You know Teague. He won't take
"Go to hell" for an answer.

921
01:35:03,629 --> 01:35:05,756
- What will you tell him?
- I'll give him directions.

922
01:35:36,247 --> 01:35:39,792
"...colored mixture generously
directly from applicator to hair.

923
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:41,794
- Gently work it through--"
- Let me have that.

924
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:44,505
I want my truck back. Stop!

925
01:35:46,257 --> 01:35:47,550
That's my truck!

926
01:35:47,634 --> 01:35:49,135
Gimme it.

927
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:55,266
"Gently work it through with fingers
to saturate every strand.

928
01:35:55,267 --> 01:35:58,103
Then comb through
with a brush and a comb...

929
01:35:58,103 --> 01:36:00,939
to be sure entire width
of every hair is wet.

930
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:02,524
Do not lather."

931
01:36:33,265 --> 01:36:36,685
- Get out of the solar system.
- Gimme it.

932
01:36:36,727 --> 01:36:38,854
- It's getting late, guys.
- Gimme it.

933
01:36:38,896 --> 01:36:40,898
- Give it back to me.
- Give it.

934
01:36:40,981 --> 01:36:43,984
- Stop it.
- I'm gonna be in the bathtub.

935
01:36:44,026 --> 01:36:46,153
Could you answer the phone--

936
01:36:46,737 --> 01:36:49,323
Could you answer the phone
for me, please?

937
01:36:49,323 --> 01:36:51,366
And can you
tuck yourselves in, please?

938
01:36:52,034 --> 01:36:53,577
Yes, we will.

939
01:36:53,619 --> 01:36:56,038
Thank you.
Good night, sweetheart.

940
01:36:56,164 --> 01:36:57,915
- See what you get?
- Good night.

941
01:37:11,722 --> 01:37:14,641
- Good night, Robbie.
- Good night, Carol Anne.

942
01:40:10,367 --> 01:40:11,743
You're not real!

943
01:40:16,165 --> 01:40:17,708
Oh! Help!

944
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:20,128
Help me!

945
01:40:33,308 --> 01:40:37,020
You're not real!

946
01:40:38,397 --> 01:40:41,066
Let me go!

947
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,906
I hate you!

948
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:49,741
You're done! I hate you!

949
01:40:49,784 --> 01:40:51,577
I hate you!

950
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:53,579
I hate you!

951
01:40:58,042 --> 01:41:00,002
Carol Anne, Robbie, run!

952
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:37,249
Open the door!

953
01:41:37,334 --> 01:41:39,252
Carol Anne, Robbie, run!

954
01:41:40,963 --> 01:41:44,049
Don't touch my babies!

955
01:41:55,561 --> 01:41:58,814
You--
Help me, somebody!

956
01:42:11,953 --> 01:42:12,995
No more.

957
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:18,543
Mr. Tuthill!

958
01:42:18,585 --> 01:42:23,173
Ben! Help!
Please help me!

959
01:42:23,299 --> 01:42:26,260
Somebody help me! Please!

960
01:43:56,646 --> 01:44:00,107
Listen!
What sort of sound is that?

961
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,944
I've got to get them!
Come on!

962
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:05,280
- What's going on?
- Don't go!

963
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:08,116
- Please, Ben! Help me!
- No, don't go!

964
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,160
Help me!

965
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:15,999
Get away from my babies!
Get away!

966
01:44:38,732 --> 01:44:40,025
Help!

967
01:45:02,757 --> 01:45:04,717
Give me your hand!

968
01:45:08,347 --> 01:45:10,223
Give me your hand!

969
01:45:14,186 --> 01:45:16,062
I can't reach you!

970
01:45:24,071 --> 01:45:27,240
- Now grab your sister!
- Take my hand!

971
01:45:27,367 --> 01:45:28,660
Come on!

972
01:45:28,743 --> 01:45:30,619
Hold on!

973
01:45:33,665 --> 01:45:37,252
God, help me!

974
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:16,125
Help us!

975
01:46:37,982 --> 01:46:42,027
You moved the cemetery,
but you left the bodies, didn't you?

976
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:46,449
You son of a bitch! You left the bodies
and you only moved the headstones!

977
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:48,702
You only moved the headstones!

978
01:46:48,744 --> 01:46:51,622
Why?

979
01:47:09,766 --> 01:47:12,226
Hurry, Dad, hurry!

980
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,647
- Dad, hurry!
- Come on.

981
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:17,773
Hurry.

982
01:47:22,362 --> 01:47:26,324
- Hurry, Dad!
- Come on. Damn it, Steven, hurry!

983
01:47:42,258 --> 01:47:44,552
What's happening?

984
01:47:44,677 --> 01:47:46,804
What's happening?

985
01:47:46,846 --> 01:47:48,681
What's happening?

986
01:47:49,391 --> 01:47:51,518
- Get in the car!
- What is it?

987
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,812
Drive away! Daddy, drive away!

988
01:47:56,523 --> 01:47:58,107
Steven, hurry!

989
01:50:01,523 --> 01:50:04,107
