1
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,303
Hello.

2
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,393
What do you look like?

3
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,152
Talk louder. I can't hear you.

4
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,488
Hey, hello, hello!

5
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,324
I can't hear you!

6
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,218
Five.

7
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,891
Yes.

8
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:34,606
I don't know.

9
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,025
Whoa. Aah! Whoa! Ow!

10
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,241
Get her in focus, boys.
Here I come!

11
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,958
Open up! Aw, shit!

12
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,928
- I'm sorry. Shit!
- Jesus H. Christ! What are you...?

13
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,598
What happened?

14
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,189
He's had all the time
in the world to throw it and he hasn't.

15
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,859
Now he's got pressure!
He has a receiver, Jim Youngblood!

16
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,369
Damn it!

17
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,883
Tweety?

18
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:54,055
Ohh.

19
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,395
Oh, shit. Tweety, couldn't you have
waited for a school day?

20
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,241
Who the hell is this guy?

21
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,243
What the hell is going on?

22
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,246
- All right!
- Steven, what's going on?

23
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,582
Freeling, what's going on here?

24
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,127
I apologize.
My neighbor's on the same remote.

25
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,424
- I bet my life on this game!
- We're missing the game!

26
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,260
Hi, Ben.

27
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,346
We got a good football game
going on here.

28
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,098
My kids want to watch Mister Rogers.

29
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,769
I don't care what you're watching.
Just show a little mercy with that thing!

30
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,857
Steve, look at this guy!

31
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,234
Move your set.

32
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,405
Move yours.

33
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,075
There it is. Okay, don't move.
That's perfect.

34
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,098
Tweety doesn't like that smell.

35
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,018
Sweetheart, Tweety can't smell a thing.

36
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,686
Put a flower with him.

37
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,730
A flower?

38
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay.

39
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,034
For when he's hungry.

40
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,373
For when he's lonely.

41
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,670
And when it's nighttime.

42
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,555
Oh, it's okay. Shh.

43
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,718
Now I lay me down to sleep...

44
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,888
...l pray the Lord my soul to keep.

45
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,264
Oh, brother.

46
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,141
Stifle it.

47
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,686
If I should die before I wake...

48
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,937
It did.

49
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,648
...l pray the Lord my soul to take.

50
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,359
That was lovely. Lovely, honey.

51
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,362
Mom, when it rots,
can we dig it up and see the bones?

52
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,491
Robbie! Will you come on down out
of the tree, please?

53
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,118
E. Buzz!

54
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,036
Can I get a goldfish now?

55
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:55,380
Come and get it.

56
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,352
Honey, you're overfeeding them.

57
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,022
Tweety Two and Tweety Three
want seconds.

58
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,858
You know what happens
when you overfeed goldfish?

59
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,821
They grow up to be...

60
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,198
...sharks!

61
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,829
Good night.

62
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,128
Mom, there's a big storm
headed this way.

63
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,048
You'll be asleep by the time
it gets here, if you hurry.

64
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,383
Come on. In you go.

65
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,056
- Good night.
- Good night.

66
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,392
Okay, lights out.

67
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,603
Closet light! Closet light!

68
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,647
My fault, my fault.

69
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,066
Turn it on, Mommy!

70
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,825
That enough?

71
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,079
- Okay?
- Good night, Ma.

72
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,747
Night, Mommy.

73
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,130
Good night.

74
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,850
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.

75
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,769
Well, you're not crazy, Pete.

76
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,772
- You mean I'm dead?
- Yes.

77
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,608
I'm....

78
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,612
You mean I....

79
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,114
This is for good?

80
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,615
Sleepwalking.

81
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,993
Nocturnal somnambulism.

82
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,536
You know what?

83
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,831
You know what?
I will bet you anything it's genetic.

84
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,004
I mean, Carol Anne last night,
and all last week, you know.

85
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,631
And me when I was 10.

86
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,554
- Would you deal with this for me?
- Sure.

87
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,559
You know....

88
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,189
You know,
once I slept-walked four blocks.

89
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:04,819
And I fell asleep in the back
of this guy's car.

90
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,699
He drove all the way to work
before discovering me.

91
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,660
God, I woke up, I started screaming.

92
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,539
People came running from everywhere.
They called the cops. The cops came.

93
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,667
They took this poor dude downtown.

94
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,295
- My father...
- Big....

95
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,671
- ...Ed.
- Mm-hm.

96
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:29,844
Big Ed has me examined for bruises
and hickeys. You name it.

97
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,804
God, I was so embarrassed.

98
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,352
Oh, shit, Steven.

99
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,356
What if we dig the pool
and Carol Anne sleepwalks...

100
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,067
...and she falls into it
before there's any water?

101
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,319
Oh, honey, no.

102
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,365
Have you ever dove off
a three-meter board, sweetheart?

103
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,701
- What's three meters?
- It's about 10 feet.

104
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,537
Let's just dig the pool
closer to the house...

105
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,040
...and let the kids jump off the roof.

106
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,917
No, honey, honey, honey.

107
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,921
Honey, a three-meter board,
it's like an air pocket, sweetheart.

108
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,548
When you dive off,
it's like free-falling, okay?

109
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,095
You got to get your position now.
These feet are positioning.

110
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,097
- Honey?
- Three meters.

111
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,890
Your diving days are over.

112
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,559
We're talking Olympics, Diane. Okay?

113
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,064
- And then I can--
- Let me see your tuck position. Ha-ha-ha!

114
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,942
Then we can jackknife into the swan.

115
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,906
You twist, turn and...

116
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,908
...splash!

117
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,746
Honey, it's right to the Nautilus machine.

118
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,498
Look at this, honey.

119
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,293
Before, after. Before, after. Before, after.

120
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,824
Don't. I'm telling you.

121
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,619
I love you. I love you!

122
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,829
You fool.

123
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,875
No, no!

124
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,297
Oh, God, I love it when you talk dirty.

125
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,761
The storm's coming closer.

126
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,848
Hey, partner.

127
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,350
Hi, honey.

128
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,811
Is everything okay?

129
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,358
It's thundering.

130
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,361
Come on. Come on. Hop up.

131
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,699
I'm the wind and you're the feather.

132
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,868
- Say good night to Mom.
- Good night.

133
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,537
Good night, sweetheart.

134
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,210
Here we go.

135
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,886
I don't like the tree, Dad.

136
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,099
It's an old tree.
It's been around here a long time.

137
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,018
It was here before my company
built the neighborhood.

138
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,104
I don't like its arms.

139
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,731
It knows I live here, doesn't it?

140
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,193
It knows everything about us.
That's why I built the house next to it.

141
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,736
So it could protect us.

142
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,656
You and Carol Anne and Dana
and your mom and me.

143
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,576
It's a very wise old tree.

144
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,037
It looks at me. It knows I live here.

145
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,751
I think the storm's gonna pass us.

146
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,336
How do you know?

147
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,922
Because I can count.

148
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,550
You know what you do?

149
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,052
When you see the lightning...

150
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,347
...you count till you hear the thunder.

151
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,266
If you can count higher each time...

152
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,227
...that means the storm's moving away
from us.

153
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,105
Want to try it? Okay.

154
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,900
Get some lightning.

155
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,361
Wait, it's coming.

156
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,116
Wow.

157
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,869
- Okay. One...
- One...

158
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,579
- ...two, three.
- ...two, three.

159
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,001
Okay, but I bet next time you'll be able
to count to at least four or five.

160
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,338
- Betcha.
- Daddy, it's for you.

161
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,632
You tell them to take a message,
sweetpea.

162
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,468
My dad wants to take a message.

163
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,932
Good night.

164
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,145
It's too hot.

165
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,647
Okay.

166
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,273
Good night, angel.

167
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,108
Happy dreams, okay?

168
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,444
Good night, Daddy.

169
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,407
One, two...

170
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,993
...three, four.

171
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,211
Did not!

172
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,171
Come on.

173
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,925
- Good night, Dana.
- Good night, Dad.

174
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,221
- Get off the phone, Dana.
- Okay.

175
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,681
Mm-hm.

176
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,106
One, two....

177
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,276
Three, four....

178
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,152
Five....

179
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,178
They're here.

180
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,736
Now listen to me, Jeff. No.
No, I'm not kidding.

181
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,406
I know, how could anybody
sleep through a 6.5?

182
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,200
There was damage.

183
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,827
The bedroom.
There's stuff in pieces all over.

184
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,581
Stop it! This is war!

185
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,834
We've been listening to the radio.
There's nothing on the radio.

186
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,294
Don't touch me.

187
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,922
It was two years after the Sylmar quake.

188
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,008
You are so obnoxious! You drive me nuts!

189
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,219
You're obnoxious.

190
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,555
- Force shields.
- You are so obnoxious.

191
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,766
That was a good one.

192
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,809
This means war, and I mean it!

193
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,690
- Hey, watch out!
- Chew your food 10 times, okay?

194
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,817
You're a big barf bag!

195
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,111
You're a doggy bag.

196
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,447
That's a good one. I'm not gonna eat it.

197
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,865
There you go, Rob.

198
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,620
Sweetheart, last night when you said,
"They're here"--

199
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,664
Can I take my goldfish to school?

200
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,667
Maybe the fault line runs
just directly under our house.

201
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,126
Wouldn't that be a scream?

202
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,045
The ceiling got crumbs on my bed.

203
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,964
- Who cares?
- Remember last night?

204
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,591
Do you remember when you woke up
and you said, "They're here?"

205
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,134
Uh-huh.

206
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,345
Who did you mean? Who's here?

207
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,347
The TV people.

208
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,642
- She's stoned.
- What do you know?

209
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,311
More than you! Ask Dad.

210
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,980
- Ask Dad.
- Ask Dad.

211
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,147
- Ask Dad.
- Shh!

212
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,400
Ask Dad. Ask Dad.

213
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,152
Hey!

214
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,779
It's not my mess.

215
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,449
Uch! Thanks a lot, jerko.
I've got class in 20 minutes.

216
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,828
- Mom! It's not my fault.
- Give me this before you cut yourself.

217
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,080
The earth moved for you?

218
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,208
It wasn't quite the same thing
for us, Jeff.

219
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,920
Okay. I'll talk-- Yeah, right. Okay.

220
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,632
Give me that before you cut yourself.

221
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,844
- It's not my fault.
- Bye, sweetpea.

222
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,804
- I'm out of here.
- Bye, honey.

223
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,431
- I'm out of here.
- Ah-ah!

224
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,765
You, I can handle.

225
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,851
- Got school.
- Yeah, well, breakfast first.

226
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,645
All right. I'll just flunk.

227
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,919
- Don't take it so serious.
- I told the son of a bitch to put--

228
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,464
- It happens on every job.
- Well, l--

229
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,716
Hey! Look at this!

230
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,220
I love that swing.

231
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,309
I love you! I love you!

232
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,186
I love you!

233
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,521
I love it!

234
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,697
No!

235
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,158
E. Buzz, no. Get down.

236
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,118
Robbie! Carol Anne!

237
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:47,873
I've told you guys to push your chairs in
when you're done at the table.

238
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,420
Honey, you're gonna ruin your eyes.
This is not good for you.

239
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,610
What's the matter, E. Buzz?

240
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,906
What are you doing?

241
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,651
- How is it?
- Great, Mrs. Freeling.

242
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,486
Okay, Bluto. Give me my cup.

243
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,989
You sure make good coffee.

244
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,425
Jesus! Don't do that, honey.

245
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,721
You want to see Mommy lying
in a cigar box covered with licorice?

246
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,348
- Uh-uh.
- Did you do this?

247
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,892
Uh-uh.

248
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,145
You guys.

249
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,149
I asked you not to pull the chairs out.

250
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,049
TV people?

251
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,928
Uh-huh.

252
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,559
Do you see them?

253
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,980
Uh-uh.

254
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,778
Do you?

255
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,075
Uh-uh.

256
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,921
I tell you, I think you're really gonna
enjoy this kitchen.

257
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,090
This is our latest development.

258
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,800
We call this Phase 4.

259
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,760
Where do you live, Mr. Freeling?

260
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:51,431
Well, we were the first family to set up
housekeeping in Cuesta Verde Estates.

261
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,766
Phase 1.

262
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,686
We had to pass through my neighborhood
to get to this one.

263
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,230
Oh, that area with the lived-in look.

264
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,899
It has that, but I think in a few months...

265
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,904
...you won't be able to distinguish
Phase 1 from Phase 3 to Phase....

266
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:11,618
You know, we have a saying around here.
The grass grows greener on every side.

267
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,080
That's the way I feel.

268
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,124
I can't tell one house from the other.

269
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,334
You know something? I think you're right.

270
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:23,005
But I think our construction standards
are really very liberal.

271
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,550
I have this neighbor and he built a Jacuzzi
in his bedroom...

272
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,304
...and it has a running aqueduct connected
to a wading pool outside.

273
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,806
It's built half in and half out
of his living room.

274
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,976
That house was featured
in Town and Country.

275
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,478
Come on, I'll show you the den.

276
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,499
Honey! Come here! Quick!

277
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,836
- Hurry! Before it stops again.
- What about the cans?

278
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,549
- Leave this here.
- Right.

279
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,093
They don't make the pick-ups yet.

280
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,222
- Okay, just stand right here. Okay?
- Huh?

281
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,725
Listen, I kept Dana and Robbie out of this...

282
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,685
...but Carol Anne was here,
so she knows.

283
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,647
But Dana would blab, and Robbie,
he'd be up for three weeks...

284
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,107
- ...sleeping on your side of the bed.
- You should sit down.

285
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,859
No, no, no.

286
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,612
Now just stand, okay?

287
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,031
- Now, just be calm.
- Okay.

288
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,785
Now reach back into our past
when you used to have an open mind.

289
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,286
- Remember that?
- Uh-huh.

290
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,415
Okay. Just try to use that
for the next couple of minutes.

291
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,209
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

292
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,503
Mother didn't cook any dinner.

293
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,505
We'll go to Pizza Hut, okay?

294
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,923
Okay, now....

295
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,591
Now just look.

296
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,551
Just look.

297
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,512
Just watch.

298
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,076
Woo-hoo!

299
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,123
Huh.

300
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,423
Come here, sweetheart.

301
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:36,263
Honey, could you move the chair
out of the way and just stay down there?

302
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,473
- Baby, let's show Daddy.
- I'm hungry!

303
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,600
Don't argue with Mommy. Come on.

304
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,562
Come on, let's just do this once.

305
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,231
Okay, here we go.

306
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,734
I want pepperoni pizza.

307
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,033
Mommy, that burns.

308
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,118
I'm sorry. The floor needs more wax.

309
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,995
- Steven, come on, you do it.
- No.

310
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,164
- Come on, honey, try.
- Uh-uh.

311
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,792
It's like there's this tickling,
you know, right in here.

312
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,754
And it starts to pull you.
The tickling pulls you.

313
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,466
All of a sudden it's like there's no air,
except that you can breathe.

314
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,134
And you're getting pulled along and--

315
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,637
- Hi, Ben.
- Mr. Tuthill. Hi.

316
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,848
If you're having problems
with your set....

317
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,392
No, no, no.
It's nothing like that.

318
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,353
Diane and I were just wondering....

319
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,606
This will sound strange
coming from me....

320
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,232
Doubt that.

321
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:36,198
- Those mosquitoes are something else.
- They're really chowing down.

322
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,200
I've never been bothered by them.

323
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,453
In fact, I don't think
I've ever been bitten by one.

324
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:46,124
As far as I know, nobody in my family's
ever been affected by them.

325
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,337
- A mosquito ever suck on you, son?
- I don't know, Dad.

326
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,380
He don't know.

327
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,508
Uh....

328
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,179
Look, Mr. Tuthill....

329
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,264
Ben.

330
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,977
- Ben.
- I'm really sorry.

331
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,521
Mr. Tuthill, look....

332
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,357
We were just....
What we were wondering is....

333
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:14,069
Look. Diane, my wife,
and I were wondering....

334
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,697
Ben, something funny
is going on here next door.

335
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,699
Something, uh....

336
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:24,579
We were wondering if maybe you had
experienced any disturbances lately.

337
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,207
What kind of disturbances?

338
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,375
Um....

339
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,585
Oh, you know, like...

340
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:34,506
...dishes or furniture moving around
by themselves.

341
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,929
Don't scratch them. You'll infect them.

342
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,265
- Just let me put this on.
- Okay.

343
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,683
Don't!

344
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,560
Boy, did I feel like a fool.

345
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,270
I'm sorry, but I had to say it.

346
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,230
We were losing pints of blood.

347
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,190
We'll keep this thing in the family.

348
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,568
- Don't scratch.
- Tomorrow, I'll call somebody in.

349
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,695
Yeah? Who, for instance?

350
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,823
I looked in the yellow pages.
Furniture movers, we got.

351
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,575
Strange phenomenon, no listing.

352
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,873
One one-thousand, two one-thousand,
three one-thousand...

353
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,916
...four one-thousand,
five one-thousand--

354
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,129
Honey, look....

355
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,798
I'm the one who lived
with this freaky thing all day...

356
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,425
...and nothing bad happened.

357
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:23,180
It's like another side of nature,
a side we're not qualified to understand.

358
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,225
When you overreact like this, it makes
what happened much too important.

359
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,604
No one's going in the kitchen
till I know what's happening.

360
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:37,569
One one-thousand, two one-thousand,
three one-thousand, four one-thousand....

361
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,746
One one-thousand,
two one-thousand, three one--

362
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,836
One one-thousand, two one-thousand--

363
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,183
- Robbie!
- Robbie!

364
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,726
Mommy!

365
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,372
Mommy!

366
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,958
Robbie!

367
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,795
Steven, hurry!

368
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,005
Dad!

369
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,508
Help me!

370
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,343
Robbie!

371
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,095
Help me, Dad! Help me!

372
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,346
Honey, be careful!

373
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,390
Mom!

374
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,351
Mommy!

375
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,025
Daddy!

376
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,041
Mom!

377
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,755
Mom! Help me! Help me! Help me!

378
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,842
- Help me!
- He's coming!

379
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,469
Mom! It's taking me in!

380
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,638
- Robbie!
- It's hurting me!

381
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,181
Steven, hurry!

382
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,726
- Dad, help me! It's taking me in!
- Hold on!

383
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,019
Honey, hold on to him!

384
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,491
No! No! No!

385
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,750
- Hold on to Daddy!
- Hold me, Daddy!

386
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,006
It's got my leg!

387
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,507
Dad, my leg!

388
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,303
Dad! Help me, Dad! Help me!

389
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,064
Look! Mom, Dad, it's a tornado!

390
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,274
It must have just skimmed us.

391
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,109
There wouldn't be a house left if....

392
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,652
Carol Anne!

393
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,780
I left her upstairs!

394
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,411
- Carol Anne!
- Baby!

395
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,288
Baby, we're coming!

396
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,124
Carol Anne!

397
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,323
- I'll go check the kitchen.
- No! No, I'll do it.

398
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,992
I'll check the kitchen.
You check your room.

399
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,713
- Carol?
- Carol Anne?

400
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,553
Baby?

401
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:38,560
Carol Anne?

402
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,525
Carol Anne? Sweetheart?

403
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,193
Carol Anne?

404
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,905
Baby?

405
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,533
Carol Anne?

406
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,877
- Diane!
- Did you find her?

407
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,005
No. I've looked everywhere.
This is crazy!

408
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,841
Oh, my....

409
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,384
My God!

410
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,929
The swimming pool.

411
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,557
The swimming pool! The swimming pool!

412
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,772
Be careful, honey.

413
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,483
Steven!

414
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,247
Mommy!

415
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,501
Mommy!

416
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,587
Nothing. Nothing.

417
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,257
Mommy!

418
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,842
Mom? Mama?

419
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,719
Mom! Mom!

420
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,596
Thank God. Thank God.

421
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,141
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

422
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,227
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

423
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:05,939
- Robbie! What's the matter?
- Mommy!

424
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,399
Carol Anne. Thank God. Baby.

425
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,819
Baby, where are you?

426
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,405
- Mommy!
- Carol Anne?

427
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,784
Mommy, come over here! Hurry!

428
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,787
- Mom! Mom!
- Robbie. What? What, baby?

429
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,415
Carol Anne! Carol Anne! Carol Anne!

430
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,961
Mommy! I can't see you, Mommy.

431
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,463
Where are you?

432
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:38,429
Mommy!

433
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,723
I can't see you, Mommy.

434
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,642
Where are you?

435
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,904
What members of the household
are involved...

436
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,532
...and what are their ages?

437
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,952
There's Diane, my wife. She's 31.

438
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,288
Thirty-two. I'm sorry.

439
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:07,292
And my oldest daughter, Dana, she's 16.

440
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,670
My son, Robert, is 8.

441
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,922
- Carol Anne....
- Hm.

442
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,009
Carol Anne, 5.

443
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,888
Has there been any publicity
about these events?

444
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,016
No, absolutely nothing.

445
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,855
Can you be reasonably sure
of not letting any get started?

446
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,566
That's the last thing in the world we want.

447
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,152
We haven't even gone to the police.

448
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,612
Hm.

449
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:41,784
Would your family welcome a serious
investigation of these disturbances...

450
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,372
...by someone who can make
first-hand observations?

451
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,002
Look, Dr. Lesh,
we don't care about the disturbances...

452
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,796
...the pounding and the flashing...

453
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,425
...the screaming, the music.

454
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,305
We just want you to find our little girl.

455
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:19,822
I should warn you that we keep the room
locked off from the rest of the house.

456
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:28,539
Robbie's sleeping with us now
and Dana spends a lot of time with friends.

457
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:32,251
Well, how many disturbances
have you recorded in the room?

458
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,046
We don't go in the room anymore.

459
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:42,261
Mr. Freeling, we'll record
any psychotronic energy or event.

460
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,182
Yes, Ryan photographed an extraordinary
episode on a case in Redlands.

461
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,600
That's right.

462
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,937
It was a child's toy,
a very small Matchbox vehicle.

463
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,190
Just rolled seven feet across
a linoleum surface.

464
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,609
The duration of the event
was seven hours.

465
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,112
Seven hours for what?

466
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,280
For the vehicle to complete the distance.

467
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,201
Of course, this would never register
on the naked eye.

468
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,787
But I have it recorded
on time-lapse camera.

469
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,373
It's fantastic.

470
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,208
Mm-hm.

471
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:51,164
We've been trying to hold ourselves
together as a family.

472
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,624
Of course, no one's been sleeping much.

473
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,877
Steven has missed so much work.

474
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,338
But he's been wonderful,
really wonderful.

475
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,009
How long have you been investigating
haunted houses?

476
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,428
- Well, Mrs. Freeling, l--
- Diane.

477
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:11,517
Diane, the determination as to whether
your home is haunted is not very easy.

478
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:18,065
I-- What I meant to say was, it might
very well be a poltergeist intrusion...

479
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,818
...instead of a classic haunting.

480
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,447
There's a difference?

481
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,365
Did you see that?

482
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,202
There'll be two more in a few seconds.
They always travel in pairs.

483
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,953
Dr. Casey.

484
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,085
Gotta be quicker than that around here.

485
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,297
It's electrical. You can smell the charge.

486
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,299
You were saying about poltergeists?

487
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:48,721
Poltergeists are usually associated
with an individual.

488
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,892
Hauntings seem to be connected
with an area.

489
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,061
A house, usually.

490
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,272
Poltergeist disturbances
are of fairly short duration.

491
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,483
Perhaps a couple of months.

492
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,568
Hauntings can go on for years.

493
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:08,825
Are you telling me that all of this
could just suddenly end at any time?

494
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,077
Yes, it could.

495
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,246
Unless it's a haunting.

496
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,249
But hauntings don't usually revolve
around living people.

497
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,000
Then we don't have much time...

498
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,962
...because my daughter is alive
somewhere inside this house.

499
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,715
--While trying to escape
from an unknown assailant.

500
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,427
Marshall is listed as critical
and under intensive care.

501
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,181
This is probably gonna seem
a little strange.

502
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,024
We hear better on this channel.
Don't ask me why.

503
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,820
Well, uh...

504
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,951
...l guess I'll call her.

505
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,457
Carol Anne?

506
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,460
Uh, it's Mommy, sweetheart.

507
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,921
Uh, we want to talk to you.

508
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,098
Please answer me, baby.

509
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,809
Please answer me.

510
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,146
Please talk to me, bunny.

511
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,987
Look at the dog.

512
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,745
Are you with us now?

513
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,958
Can you say hello to Daddy?

514
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,801
Hello, Daddy.

515
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,599
Hello, sweetpea.

516
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,106
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

517
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,609
Hello, Mommy.

518
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,361
Hello, baby!

519
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,408
Can you see me?

520
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,203
Can you see Mommy?

521
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,791
Mommy?

522
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,377
Where are you? Where are you?

523
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,880
We're home, baby. We're home.

524
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,217
Can you find me?
Can you find a way home to us, baby?

525
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,762
Mommy, where are you?
I can't find you. I can't!

526
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,724
I'm afraid of the light, Mommy.

527
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,935
I'm afraid of the light!

528
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,562
Tell her to stay away from the light.

529
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,564
Maybe it's a way out!

530
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,734
It is a way out, but not for her.
Tell her quickly.

531
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,321
- Uh, Carol Anne--
- Tell her to stay away from the light!

532
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,864
Tell her, Diane.

533
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,825
Sweetheart, stay away from the light.

534
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,910
The light is dangerous. Don't go near it.

535
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,204
- Don't even look at it.
- Dr. Lesh.

536
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't believe it, but the voice could be
coming from a CB transmitter in the house.

537
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,918
This isn't a hoax.

538
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,686
What the hell is this?

539
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,563
Anything?

540
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,981
Nothing's registering.

541
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,734
Mommy, there's somebody here.

542
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,782
Mommy, Mommy, is that you?

543
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,494
No, it's not Mommy. Who is it, Dr. Lesh?

544
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,705
- Who's with you, baby?
- Who's with you?

545
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,792
Mommy, somebody's coming.
Mommy, help me, please!

546
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,420
- God. My God. My baby.
- Mommy!

547
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,796
No.

548
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,134
You bastard! She's just a baby!

549
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,304
Help her! Can't you hear
what's happening? Help her!

550
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,017
- Listen! Listen!
- Help me! Get away from me!

551
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,310
Leave me alone!

552
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,730
Mommy, help me! Help me, Mommy!

553
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,500
She just moved through me.

554
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,002
My God!

555
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,171
I felt her.

556
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,301
I can smell her.

557
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,846
It's her.

558
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,058
Smell my clothes.
It's her. She's all over me.

559
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,060
- It's her. She's all over me.
- My God.

560
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,354
It's her. I felt her.

561
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,774
- It is. It's her.
- It's her.

562
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,111
It is. It is. It's my baby.

563
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,987
It's my baby.

564
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,407
She went through my soul.

565
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,675
Mommy!

566
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,935
Carol Anne?

567
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,522
I can't hear her anymore.
Carol Anne? Honey?

568
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:39,905
Where exactly do you suppose Carol Anne
was playing when she vanished from sight?

569
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,907
Diane?

570
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,245
Where was Carol Anne playing
when she disappeared?

571
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,748
Her bedroom closet.

572
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,334
Let's go up there.

573
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:56,255
- They won't let you in.
- We'll just see about that.

574
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,426
Whatever happened to you?

575
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,929
I was about to check out
the kid's bedroom when, I don't know...

576
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,848
...something took a bite out of me.

577
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,266
You got bit?

578
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,602
That or the worst muscle spasm
in the world.

579
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,770
Lift up your shirt. Let's have a look.

580
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,272
Wow!

581
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,359
We'll spend the night downstairs.

582
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,236
No. Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong.

583
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,614
Honey, I want you
to take Dana and Robbie...

584
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,157
...and spend tonight in town.

585
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,451
I am not leaving here
without Carol Anne.

586
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,329
I can't stay here.
I've gotta go to Lisa's place.

587
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,956
- No, you go, baby.
- I just don't want to stay here!

588
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,460
I'm not gonna leave anybody
in this house alone.

589
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,645
Can we talk to you?

590
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,438
Let's go.

591
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,360
Any movement out of them?

592
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,195
There's some ionization flux.

593
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:05,157
I'd like to see that they're not caused
by humidity from structure leakage...

594
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,660
...but I'm not going up there to find out.

595
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,288
We have got much more than
the paranormal episode taking place here.

596
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,917
There is a measurable physical science
in this house that goes beyond...

597
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,920
...any of the creaking doors
or cold spots I've experienced.

598
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,048
The voice on the television,
where is it coming from?

599
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:25,511
The absence of a signal on a channel that
is not receiving a broadcast means that...

600
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,682
...it's free to receive a lot of noise
from many things, like shortwaves.

601
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,518
Solar disturbances, car ignition sparkings.

602
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,061
Outer space.

603
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,854
Or inner space.

604
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:41,360
Yes. What if these people had an area
of bilocation in their own living room?

605
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,028
- What do you mean?
- No, I mean it.

606
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,531
If that is the way out...

607
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:50,327
...then maybe somewhere in this house
there's a way in.

608
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,005
No, please, leave it on.

609
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,719
Thanks.

610
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,056
You know, when it's quiet like now...

611
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,685
...l can imagine how all of this must look
from your side.

612
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,187
I'm really embarrassed.

613
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,897
Nonsense.

614
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,902
I'm the one who should be embarrassed,
being here with you nice people.

615
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,905
Parapsychology isn't something
you master in.

616
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,408
There are no certificates of graduation...

617
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,744
...no licenses to practice.

618
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,539
I am a professional psychologist...

619
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,793
...who spent most of my time engaged
in this ghostly hobby...

620
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:44,590
...which makes me, I suppose, the most
irresponsible woman of my age that I know.

621
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,928
Would you like a glass for that?

622
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,764
No, thank you.

623
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,479
You know, you were very funny.

624
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,814
Your hands were shaking
about a mile a minute.

625
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,695
It isn't over.

626
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,281
I'm absolutely terrified.

627
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,414
It's all the things
that we don't understand.

628
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,087
I feel like the protohuman,
coming out of the forest primeval...

629
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:26,465
...and seeing the moon for the first time
and throwing rocks at it.

630
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,303
If I got killed, would I come back as a ghost
and get stuck in the house...

631
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,846
...like my sister?

632
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,557
Your sister isn't dead, Robbie.

633
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,978
If I got killed, could I visit her
and show her how to get back here?

634
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:44,650
You could tie a rope around me and hold it,
then somebody could come and get us...

635
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,152
...and we'd go live somewhere else.

636
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:54,993
Some people believe that when you die
your soul goes to heaven.

637
00:56:55,495 --> 00:57:00,541
When Grandpa was dead, I looked at him
on the hospital bed, and I was watching...

638
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,168
...but I didn't see anything
go up out of him.

639
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,630
His soul was invisible, Robbie.
You couldn't see it.

640
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,675
But how come Grandpa isn't on television
with Carol Anne?

641
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,843
Shh.

642
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,762
Some people believe
that when people die...

643
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,224
...there's a wonderful light...

644
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:21,854
...as bright as the sun.
But it doesn't hurt to look into it.

645
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,108
All the answers to all the questions
that you ever want to know...

646
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,360
...are inside that light.

647
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:33,198
And when you walk to it,
you become a part of it forever.

648
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,909
And then...

649
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,455
...some people die,
but they don't know that they've gone.

650
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,208
They think they're still alive?

651
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,711
Yes.

652
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,881
Maybe they didn't want to die.

653
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,175
Maybe they weren't ready.

654
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,636
Maybe they hadn't lived fully yet
or they'd lived a long time...

655
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,389
...but they still wanted more life.

656
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,601
They resist going into that light...

657
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,437
...however hard the light wants them.

658
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,565
They just hang around...

659
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,569
...watch TV,
watch their friends grow up...

660
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,364
...feeling unhappy and jealous...

661
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,910
...and those feelings are bad.

662
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,703
They hurt.

663
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,165
And then...

664
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,751
...some people...

665
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:30,088
...just get lost on the way to the light.

666
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,926
And they need someone
to guide them to it.

667
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:39,264
So some people get angry and
throw things around, like in my bedroom?

668
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,767
Yes.

669
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,186
Just like in school.

670
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:48,941
Like some kids are nice to you,
some kids are mean.

671
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,652
I got beat up once by three kids.

672
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,737
They took my lunch money.

673
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,366
Maybe they got hit by a truck
and they're upstairs right now.

674
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,119
Listen, partner, maybe we ought
to get some shut-eye, okay?

675
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,454
Okay.

676
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,956
You know what?

677
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,167
When we called Grandma tonight,
she got really excited...

678
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,294
...that you're coming to stay with her...

679
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:13,173
...and she's planning all these neat things
for you guys to do.

680
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:17,177
- Can I take E. Buzz with me when we go?
- Sure, you can.

681
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,305
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetie.

682
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,140
Good night, lady.

683
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,477
Good night, Dad.

684
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,146
Good night, Rob.

685
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,732
I love you.

686
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,528
Good night, Carol Anne.

687
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,547
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

688
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,883
- Okay.
- Thanks.

689
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,459
What is it? What is it?

690
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,019
Roll it back!

691
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,277
I think we've got one. I think it recorded.

692
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,452
Yes, it recorded!

693
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,222
Look at all of them.

694
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,225
Is that our house?

695
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,980
Who are all those people?

696
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,733
They're so lonely.

697
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:11,651
So alone.

698
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,575
Where are they coming from?

699
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,619
I don't know.

700
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,399
Robbie?

701
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,696
Call me, okay?

702
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,581
This cameo is over 100 years old.

703
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:07,999
Yeah, some haul.

704
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,544
And this watch is only a few years old.
And it's not yours.

705
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,088
No.

706
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,340
Well, I'm off.

707
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:19,052
I'm taking these back to the lab
along with the tapes.

708
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,680
I'm gonna have to display these,
you know.

709
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,517
- Please, not on 60 Minutes.
- Or That's Incredible.

710
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,770
I'll get it. Excuse me.

711
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,125
I'm leaving Ryan here with you.

712
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,294
Marty won't be coming back.

713
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,760
I am coming back.

714
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,059
And I'll bring some help.

715
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,061
Try not to worry.

716
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,316
Thank you.

717
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:19,487
We've missed you down at the office.
The boys have gotten worried...

718
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,448
...so I took it upon myself to--

719
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:26,077
Jesus, Steve, you look like shit.
Aren't you feeling any better?

720
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,121
I'm still weak. I've got the flu.

721
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,916
- I can't get up and l--
- Looks like you got some cable problems.

722
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:35,461
Yeah, well, move over here.
Cable's been off for a couple months.

723
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,756
We'll have to look into that.
The rest of the block dark too?

724
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,383
No, it's just us.

725
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:45,054
Got some electrical problems
as well here.

726
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:48,600
What have you got screwed in there?
A 300-watt bulb?

727
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:52,770
You afraid of burglars or you trying
to attract every insect in Cuesta Verde?

728
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,441
Steve, tell me something.
Are you happy here?

729
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,152
- Yes, I am.
- Forgive me for asking these questions...

730
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,155
...but we don't want to lose the best rep
we've ever had...

731
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,450
...to the flu or other opportunities.

732
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:09,621
Seeing all that software in your living room
makes me wonder if, well...

733
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,623
...maybe you got something on the side.

734
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,334
No, I just read Popular Mechanics.
I got hobbies.

735
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,711
Feel like going for a little ride?

736
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,630
I'd like to show you something.

737
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:51,621
Hello?

738
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,835
Carol Anne?

739
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,683
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

740
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,355
One of your children was born
in your house, huh?

741
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:19,941
Carol Anne.

742
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,778
I understand that she's missed
a lot of school.

743
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:27,532
One of Trask's daughters
is in the same nursery class.

744
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,909
She caught the flu as well?

745
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,869
Yeah, we've all got the same thing.

746
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,538
I'm sorry.

747
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,707
I didn't see her.

748
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,500
She's around.

749
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:41,421
Listen, I wonder if you'd mind
if I asked you a question.

750
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:42,880
Are you leaving Cuesta Verde?

751
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:45,633
It's hard to believe the day
could be this beautiful.

752
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:50,722
How could anyone in the world
have a problem on a day like this?

753
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,227
How's that spot for a bay window, huh?

754
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:03,443
It's pretty nice if you're living up here,
but not so great down there in the valley...

755
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,987
...looking at those homes
cutting into the hillside.

756
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,490
You don't have to live
in the Valley anymore.

757
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,743
What are you saying?

758
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,495
We're starting Phase 5 right here
where we're standing.

759
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,248
All of this can be
your master-bedroom suite.

760
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,250
That can be your view.

761
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,085
Interested?

762
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,757
Mr. Teague, that's a generous offer.

763
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,927
- I'm just not a developer.
- You're responsible for 42 percent of sales.

764
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,096
That's almost half of everything there.

765
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:35,600
Almost $70 million worth
of dwelling and properties.

766
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,144
Now, that's a whole generation
of security...

767
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,438
...that nobody can put a price tag on.

768
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,443
Look, I know we should have made you
a full partner three years ago.

769
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,945
Well, I don't want to lose you now.

770
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,664
- Not much room for a pool, is there?
- We own all the land.

771
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:02,919
We've already made arrangements
for relocating the cemetery.

772
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,546
Oh, you're kidding.

773
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,133
- Come on. That's sacrilegious, isn't it?
- Don't worry about it.

774
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:12,762
After all,
it's not ancient tribal burial ground.

775
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,430
It's just...

776
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,099
...people.

777
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:18,935
Besides, we've done it before.

778
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:22,688
- When?
- In '76.

779
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,774
Right down there.

780
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,323
- Cuesta Verde?
- All 300 acres.

781
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,409
And let me tell you, it was quite a deal.

782
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,494
But I never heard anything about it.

783
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,163
It's not something one advertises
on a billboard...

784
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,832
...or on the side of a bus.

785
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,083
What's worrying you?

786
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:46,003
Friends and relatives can visit
their loved ones in Broxton Memorial Park.

787
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,506
It's only five minutes further,
for Christ's sake.

788
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,427
Yeah, well, five minutes.
You know, that's no great hardship.

789
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:55,513
I suppose that would be okay.

790
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,099
Okay with whom?

791
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,019
Whomever might complain.

792
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,356
Nobody's complained until now.

793
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,128
We've had two experiences
in the kitchen.

794
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,921
Uh, this is the den.

795
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,895
Would y'all mind hanging back?
You're jamming my frequencies.

796
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:37,448
So, what side of the rainbow
are we working tonight, Dr. Lesh?

797
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,160
Is this your Knott's Berry Farm solution?

798
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,413
I know what you're thinking.
But you must take my word for it.

799
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:46,832
She's cleaned many houses.

800
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,626
Her gifts have been documented--

801
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:51,379
Look, we haven't heard Carol Anne
since last night.

802
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,632
Why is this door locked, Mr. Freeling?

803
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,972
- Answer her, Steven.
- I am.

804
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,643
I am addressing the living.

805
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,104
I'm sorry. Sorry.

806
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,648
That's the room my son
and daughter used to occupy.

807
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,858
We believe it's the heart of the house.

808
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,319
This house has many hearts.

809
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,698
What is the matter?

810
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,283
What's the matter?

811
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,912
I was trying to answer her with my mind...

812
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,831
...and she couldn't hear me.

813
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:30,293
I thought you said Tangina Barrons
was an extraordinary clairvoyant?

814
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,044
I am.

815
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:36,632
I just don't like trick answers.

816
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,518
Come here, honey...

817
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,770
...and give me your hand.

818
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,482
I'm not gonna bite you.

819
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:08,456
Come on down here. You're gonna give
me whiplash looking up at you.

820
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:16,881
Your daughter is alive and in this house.

821
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:32,229
Where was the last incident
of bilocation?

822
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,572
I get my strongest feeling...

823
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,243
...the point of origin is
in the child's closet upstairs.

824
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,955
Yes, I believe that too.

825
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:55,086
Now, honey, are you gonna be strong
for me and for your daughter?

826
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:58,839
I can do absolutely nothing
without your faith in this world...

827
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,925
...and your love for the children.

828
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,844
I will. Believe me, I will.

829
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,805
And will you do anything I ask...

830
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:10,851
...even if it comes contrary to your beliefs
as a human being and a Christian?

831
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,479
Yes, I promise. Please.

832
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:22,947
Would you all come on in?

833
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,865
Gather round.

834
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,622
There is no death.

835
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,959
It is only a transition...

836
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,962
...to a different sphere of consciousness.

837
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,800
Carol Anne is not like those she's with.

838
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,095
She is a living presence...

839
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:49,598
...in their spiritual, earthbound plane.

840
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:53,352
They're attracted to the one thing
about her...

841
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,524
...that is different from themselves:
her life force.

842
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,318
It is very strong.

843
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,655
It gives off its own illumination.

844
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:08,242
It is a light that implies life...

845
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,078
...and memory of love and home...

846
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,665
...and earthly pleasures...

847
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:18,878
...something they desperately desire...

848
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:22,131
...but can't have anymore.

849
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:26,969
Right now,
she's the closest thing to that...

850
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:31,348
...and that is a terrible distraction...

851
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,350
...from the real light...

852
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:36,687
...that has finally come for them.

853
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:39,231
Do you understand me?

854
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:45,696
These souls, who, for whatever reason...

855
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,531
...are not at rest...

856
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,869
...are also not aware
that they have passed on.

857
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:56,165
They're not part of consciousness
as we know it.

858
01:19:56,333 --> 01:20:00,544
They linger in a perpetual dream state...

859
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:04,256
...a nightmare from which
they cannot awake.

860
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,802
Inside this spectral light...

861
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:10,221
...is salvation.

862
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,891
A window to the next plane.

863
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,560
They must pass through this membrane...

864
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:21,565
...where friends are waiting
to guide them to new destinies.

865
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:25,778
Carol Anne must help them cross over.

866
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,906
And she will only hear...

867
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,575
...her mother's voice.

868
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,579
Now...

869
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,749
...hold onto yourselves.

870
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:45,256
There's one more thing.

871
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:50,344
A terrible presence is in there with her.

872
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:54,890
So much rage, so much betrayal.

873
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,561
I've never sensed anything like it.

874
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:02,439
I don't know what hovers
over this house...

875
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,277
...but it was strong enough
to punch a hole into this world...

876
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:09,446
...and take your daughter away from you.

877
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:14,159
It keeps Carol Anne very close to it...

878
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,954
...and away from the spectral light.

879
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,082
It lies to her.

880
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:24,295
It says things
only a child can understand.

881
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:28,382
It has been using her
to restrain the others.

882
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:31,677
To her...

883
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:35,306
...it simply is another child.

884
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:39,310
To us...

885
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:41,395
...it is the beast.

886
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,038
Now let's go get your daughter.

887
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,460
Red ribbons...

888
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:05,961
...handkerchiefs...

889
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,838
...tennis balls.

890
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,089
Rope's right here.

891
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,051
- Bath water?
- I shut it off. It's ready too.

892
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:13,719
All right.

893
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,013
Call to her.

894
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,063
Carol Anne?

895
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:28,025
Carol Anne, it's Mommy.
Can you hear me?

896
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:35,199
Carol Anne, please tell Mommy hello.

897
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:38,202
Try again.

898
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,498
Can you say hello to Daddy?

899
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:46,293
Daddy and I miss you so much.

900
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:49,838
So much. We love you so much.

901
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,882
Please just say hello.

902
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:54,093
She's under restraint.

903
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,886
What? Who's restraining her?

904
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:59,723
There are many arms about her.
She thinks it's safe. Quickly!

905
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,434
Who is she more threatened by,
you or your husband?

906
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:05,896
Neither! Steve decides the punishment.
The children know that.

907
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,732
- That's not fair. I've never hit her.
- Fight later!

908
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,735
Steven, make Carol Anne answer you!

909
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:17,658
- Carol Anne? It's Daddy.
- Be cross with her.

910
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,577
Be angry with her,
or you'll never see her again.

911
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:23,288
Carol Anne, I want you to answer me!

912
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,333
Tell her if she doesn't answer you,
she'll get a spanking.

913
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:30,921
- Come on, I've never spanked the children.
- Honey, please, just tell her.

914
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,049
Carol Anne?

915
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,553
Answer your parents or you'll get
a real spanking from both of us!

916
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,555
Mommy, help me!

917
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:45,060
- She's away from him.
- Away from whom? Is she all right?

918
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:47,396
Diane, ask about the light.

919
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:51,734
Mommy, help me, please.

920
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,235
Carol Anne?

921
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:56,947
- Honey, do you see a light?
- Help me, please!

922
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,991
Mommy! Mommy, help me!

923
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,284
Shh.

924
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,287
- Tell her to go to the light.
- No!

925
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,874
They'll follow her, they've followed her
for weeks. Now tell her!

926
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,085
- You must do what I say.
- It's all right. Tell her, Diane.

927
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,171
Mommy, I can't find you!

928
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:15,466
Run to the light, Carol Anne!
Run as fast as you can!

929
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,301
- Are you in the light?
- No.

930
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,470
- Tell her you are.
- No! It's a lie!

931
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:23,182
You can't choose life or death when
we're dealing with what's in between.

932
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:25,642
Tell her before it's too late.

933
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,270
Run to the light, baby!

934
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:31,148
- Mommy's in the light!
- Tell her you're waiting for her.

935
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:35,360
Mommy is waiting for you in the light!
I hate you for this.

936
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:38,739
Now clear your minds.
It knows what scares you.

937
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,325
It has from the very beginning.

938
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:44,787
Don't give it any help.
It knows too much already.

939
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,956
Now, open the door.

940
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:24,701
Ryan!

941
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:28,372
Get downstairs and wait by the target!

942
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:30,249
Okay!

943
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,583
Steven!

944
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:35,671
Give me the tennis ball
marked number one!

945
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,752
Dr. Lesh! It's my handwriting!
It came right out of thin air!

946
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:20,132
The ball came back! It's his handwriting.

947
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:30,267
Kiss my ass! Number two!

948
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,935
Diane!

949
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,646
Give me your hand!

950
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,464
She's at the mouth of the corridor!

951
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,466
Tell her to stop!

952
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,177
Tell her not to go into the light!

953
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:08,805
Carol Anne? Listen to me!

954
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,892
Do not go into the light!

955
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,479
Stop where you are! Turn away from it!

956
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,356
Don't even look at it!

957
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:19,983
Hurry with the rope!

958
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,281
Throw it into the light!

959
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:36,541
Fantastic!

960
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,460
I got it!

961
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:43,757
Tell him to take up the slack gently.

962
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,844
Take up the slack!

963
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:49,513
Okay!

964
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:16,248
Help me tie this around my waist!

965
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,083
What are you doing?

966
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,253
I'm going in after her!

967
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,131
She won't come to you! Let me go!

968
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,341
You've never done this before.

969
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,885
Neither have you!

970
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:31,596
You're right. You go.

971
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,224
- No! No! Let me!
- You can't!

972
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:37,894
Who's strong enough to stay up here
and hold the rope?

973
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:05,255
I love you!

974
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,424
No!

975
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,260
No! Go downstairs and wait by Ryan...

976
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:15,432
...and pull only when I say so!
Only when I say!

977
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,258
Steven!

978
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,471
Don't let go!

979
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,306
Never!

980
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:07,651
It's coming.

981
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,986
How will we know she's got her?

982
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,948
When will we know?

983
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,376
Hey!

984
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,548
Cross over, children!

985
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,842
All are welcome!

986
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:34,428
All welcome.

987
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,930
Go into the light!

988
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:39,808
No! No! You said no!

989
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:44,020
There is peace and serenity in the light.

990
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,398
You said don't go into the light!

991
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:54,114
Diane!

992
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,993
Steven, not yet!

993
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,494
Diane!

994
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:18,763
- They're here!
- They're back.

995
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,726
Diane! No, please, no!

996
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,478
Get them into the water!

997
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,230
No, no, no. I'm helping you.

998
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,566
I'll get her something.... Don't worry.

999
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:38,158
Get her to the water. She's all right.
She's gonna be all right.

1000
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,745
Diane.

1001
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:45,916
Come on. Come on, breathe now.
Come on, breathe.

1002
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,336
Just take a breath.
Breathe, honey, breathe.

1003
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:51,922
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

1004
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:56,092
Diane. Diane, breathe, breathe, breathe!

1005
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:58,970
That's it. Come on, baby. Come on.

1006
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:01,932
Come on, breathe! That's it, breathe.

1007
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,319
Baby.

1008
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,282
Sweetheart.

1009
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:24,120
Sweetpea, it's Daddy. Come on, honey.

1010
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:25,956
Come on, pumpkin.

1011
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,295
Hi, Daddy.

1012
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:55,068
This house is clean.

1013
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:15,171
Uh, be careful.

1014
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,345
I'm going to dinner
with Janice and Brian.

1015
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:24,681
- Is your room packed?
- Everything but the bed.

1016
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,641
- Mom?
- Will we sleep here tonight?

1017
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:28,560
Uh, I guess not.

1018
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:33,064
So you better get Brian to bring you home
right after dinner.

1019
01:33:33,232 --> 01:33:36,735
Because Dad wants us to stay
at the Holiday Inn on I-74.

1020
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:39,279
- Oh, yeah. I remember that place.
- Mom?

1021
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,239
- You what?
- Mom?

1022
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:44,284
- Are you gonna do anything about this?
- About what?

1023
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:45,994
Your new gray.

1024
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:47,203
Oh.

1025
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:49,039
- Mom?
- You don't like it?

1026
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:51,541
- You don't think it's kind of punk?
- Mom?

1027
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:53,043
Bye, Mom.

1028
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,053
Okay, Rob. That thing almost killed me.

1029
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:09,059
- You okay? Don't hurt your back.
- Fine.

1030
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:13,063
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

1031
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:16,941
I feel a little hung over,
like I've been asleep for a few days...

1032
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:19,736
...but I feel good, Steven, I really do.

1033
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,410
She doesn't seem to remember any of it.

1034
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,207
Oh, what a day.

1035
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,626
Smell that mimosa.

1036
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:38,088
Cut yourself a bouquet to take with you,
because we're not staying.

1037
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,714
I know.

1038
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:44,719
We worked so hard for this.

1039
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:48,932
- Many beautiful memories.
- I gotta go to the office...

1040
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,351
...and pick up some stuff.
Clean up a few things.

1041
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,436
- Okay.
- I'll be back early.

1042
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:57,107
- So we're leaving tonight for sure?
- Yeah, we are.

1043
01:34:57,274 --> 01:35:01,361
I'll tell you what. If the kids get sleepy
just let them conk out till I get home.

1044
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,821
How's Teague taking it?

1045
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:05,115
He won't take "Go to hell"
for an answer.

1046
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:08,827
- What are you gonna tell him?
- I'll give him directions.

1047
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:24,259
I love you.

1048
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:42,360
"Working from front to back, apply
mixture directly from applicator to hair.

1049
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,154
- Gently work it--"
- Give me that.

1050
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:46,823
- No! Give me this!
- Give me my truck back!

1051
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,616
Stop!

1052
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:50,660
Give me my truck.

1053
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,662
Give me it!

1054
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:58,168
"Gently work it through
to saturate every strand...

1055
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:01,004
...then comb through
with a wide-tooth brush and a comb...

1056
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:05,592
...to be sure that every hair is wet.
Do not lather."

1057
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,749
- You! Give me this!
- Get out of the solar system!

1058
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,209
Give me it!

1059
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:41,377
- It's getting late, guys.
- Give me it!

1060
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:44,005
- Give it back to me! Stop it.
- Give me it!

1061
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:48,885
I'll be in the bathtub for a little while,
so could you please answer the phone?

1062
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:51,930
Robbie! Could you answer
the phone for me, please? Okay?

1063
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:54,140
And can you tuck yourselves in, please?

1064
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:55,391
- No!
- No.

1065
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:57,227
- Yes! We will.
- Thank you.

1066
01:36:57,394 --> 01:37:00,772
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night.

1067
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:17,622
- Good night, Robbie.
- Good night, Carol Anne.

1068
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:14,632
You're not real! Aah!

1069
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:17,635
Robbie!

1070
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,640
Help! Help me! Help me!

1071
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:34,527
No!

1072
01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:37,113
- No!
- You're not real!

1073
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:39,615
No! No!

1074
01:40:39,783 --> 01:40:41,034
No, let go!

1075
01:40:42,953 --> 01:40:43,953
Let me go!

1076
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:51,127
I hate you! I hate you!

1077
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:54,380
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

1078
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:02,847
Carol Anne! Robbie! Run!

1079
01:41:09,646 --> 01:41:11,314
Robbie!

1080
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:14,525
Mom!

1081
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:18,488
Mom! Mom!

1082
01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:30,333
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1083
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:38,883
Mom, open the door!

1084
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:42,095
- Open the door!
- Carol Anne! Robbie! Run!

1085
01:41:43,555 --> 01:41:46,224
No, don't touch my babies!

1086
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,352
No!

1087
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:02,615
Help me, somebody.

1088
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:15,795
No more.

1089
01:42:16,338 --> 01:42:18,089
Robbie!

1090
01:42:18,423 --> 01:42:20,299
Mr. Tuthill!

1091
01:42:21,718 --> 01:42:25,638
Ben! Ben! Help! Please help me!

1092
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:29,100
Somebody, somebody! Please!

1093
01:43:58,315 --> 01:43:59,357
Your children!

1094
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:00,942
- Listen!
- Help me!

1095
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:04,737
- What sort of sound is that?
- I've got to get them! Come on!

1096
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,782
- What's going on?
- No, Ben, don't go!

1097
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:10,701
- Please, Ben, please help me!
- No, don't go in there!

1098
01:44:10,869 --> 01:44:12,620
Help me!

1099
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:17,416
Get away from my babies!

1100
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,001
Get away!

1101
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,025
Help! Help!

1102
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:56,664
Help us! Help us!

1103
01:44:57,082 --> 01:45:00,209
- Mom!
- Grab me!

1104
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,047
Robbie!

1105
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:13,222
Give me your hand!

1106
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:16,017
Mommy!

1107
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,061
Mom! I can't reach you!

1108
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:28,487
- Now grab your sister!
- Take my hand!

1109
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:31,032
- Grab her!
- Take my hand!

1110
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,409
Hold on!

1111
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:39,915
- Robbie!
- God, help me!

1112
01:46:03,398 --> 01:46:04,815
Diane!

1113
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,447
- Get out!
- Where?!

1114
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:18,996
Steven, help us!

1115
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:35,763
Dad!

1116
01:46:40,977 --> 01:46:44,980
You son of a bitch, you moved the cemetery
but you left the bodies, didn't you?

1117
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:49,318
You son of a bitch, you left the bodies
and you only moved the headstones!

1118
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:52,029
You only moved the headstones!

1119
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:54,573
Why?! Why?!

1120
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:56,826
Steven!

1121
01:46:57,619 --> 01:46:59,036
Steven!

1122
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,509
Come on! Hurry, Dad, hurry!
