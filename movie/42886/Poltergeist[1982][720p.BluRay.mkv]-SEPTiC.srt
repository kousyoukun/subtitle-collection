1
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,031
Hello?

2
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,906
What do you look like?

3
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,739
Talk louder!

4
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,679
I can't hear you!

5
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,409
Hey, hello!

6
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:02,077
Hello! I can't hear you!

7
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,303
Five.

8
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:30,876
I don't know.

9
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:35,113
I don't know.

10
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,740
Get her in focus! Here I come!

11
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:58,083
Open up! Shit!

12
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,333
Jesus H. Christ!
What are you...?

13
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:14,864
What happened?

14
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,315
Now he's got pressure.
He has a receiver!

15
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:29,277
When it's time to relax

16
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,915
One beer stands clear

17
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,492
Oh, damn it!

18
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,333
Tweety?

19
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:00,844
Oh, shit, Tweety! Couldn't you
have waited for a school day?

20
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:09,758
Won't you please

21
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:11,420
Please won't you be

22
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,691
Who the hell is this guy?

23
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:16,063
What the hell's going on?

24
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:21,170
Freeling, what's goin' on here?

25
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:24,298
I apologize!
My neighbor's on the same remote!

26
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:29,876
I bet my life on this game!
Are you kiddin' me?

27
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:34,813
Hi, Ben. We got a good
football game goin' on here.

28
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,547
My kids wanna watch
"Mr. Rogers."

29
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:41,182
I don't care what you're watchin'!
Just show some mercy with that thing!

30
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,324
Come on, Steve!

31
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:47,624
Move your set.

32
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:54,595
- Move yours, Ben.
- There it is. Don't move.

33
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,299
Tweety doesn't like that smell.

34
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,201
Sweetheart,
Tweety can't smell a thing.

35
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,966
Put a flower with him.

36
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,974
A flower?

37
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,017
For when he's hungry.

38
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:25,492
For when he's lonely.

39
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,261
For when it's nighttime.

40
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,798
Oh, it's okay.

41
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,939
Now I lay me down to sleep...

42
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,106
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

43
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,115
- Oh, brother.
- Stifle it.

44
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,617
If I should die before I wake...

45
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,119
It did.

46
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,815
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

47
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,484
That was lovely.
Lovely, honey.

48
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,460
Mom, when it rots,
can we dig up the bones?

49
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,363
Robbie! Will you come
on down out of the tree?

50
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,365
E. Buzz!

51
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:45,062
Can I have a goldfish now?

52
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,175
Come and get it.

53
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,543
Come and get it.

54
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:50,924
You're overfeeding them.

55
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,935
Tweety Two and Tweety Three
want seconds.

56
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,767
You know what happens
when you overfeed goldfish?

57
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,906
They grow up to be... sharks!

58
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:09,716
Good night.

59
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,915
Mom, there's a big storm
headed this way.

60
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:19,654
You'll be asleep by the time
it gets here if you hurry.

61
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:22,196
Come on. In you go.

62
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,968
Good night, sweetie.

63
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,472
Okay, lights out.

64
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,599
Closet light!

65
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:35,609
My fault.

66
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:38,111
Turn it on, Mommy!

67
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,753
That enough?

68
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,954
- Okay?
- Good night, Mom.

69
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,584
Night, Mommy.

70
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,795
Good night.

71
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:11,673
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.

72
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:14,146
You're not crazy, Pete.

73
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:17,414
You mean I'm dead?

74
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:20,078
I'm...

75
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:25,749
You mean...
You mean this is for good?

76
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,522
Sleepwalking.

77
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:31,325
Nocturnal somnambulism.
You know what?

78
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,561
I will bet you anything
it's genetic.

79
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,969
I mean, Carol Anne last night
and all last week.

80
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,271
And me when I was ten.

81
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:48,747
- Would you deal with this?
- Sure.

82
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,845
You know...

83
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,149
once I slept-walked four blocks...

84
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:04,288
and I fell asleep
in the back of this guy's car.

85
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:09,568
He drove all the way to work
before discovering me.

86
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:12,468
God, I woke up,
I started screaming.

87
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,507
People came running, called the cops.

88
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:19,010
The cops took
this poor dude downtown.

89
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,046
- My father, Ed...
- Big.

90
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,349
Big Ed has me examined
for bruises and hickeys.

91
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,685
God, I was so embarrassed!

92
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,627
Oh, shit, Steve.

93
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,187
What if we dig the pool,
you know...

94
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:43,861
and Carol Anne sleepwalks and falls
into it before there's any water?

95
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:46,062
Oh, honey, no.

96
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:49,971
Have you ever dove off
a three-meter board, sweetheart?

97
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,533
- What's three meters?
- It's about ten feet.

98
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:58,275
Let's dig the pool closer to the house
and let the kids jump off the roof.

99
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:00,909
No, honey, honey, honey.

100
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:04,819
A three-meter board is like
an air pocket, sweetheart.

101
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:08,586
When you dive off,
it's like free-falling, okay?

102
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,790
You gotta get your feet in position.
Three meters.

103
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,332
Honey, your diving days are over.

104
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,494
We're talkin' Olympics,
Diane, okay?

105
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:22,963
Let me see your tuck position.

106
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,635
We can jackknife into the swan.

107
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,610
Twist, turn...

108
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,172
and splash!

109
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,616
Honey, it's right to
the Nautilus machine.

110
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:41,852
Look at this, honey.
Before, after.

111
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,189
Before, after.
Before, after.

112
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:57,326
- Don't.
- I love you.

113
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:11,338
Oh, God, I love it
when you talk dirty!

114
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,641
Storm is coming closer.

115
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,786
Hey, partner.

116
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:22,219
Hi, honey.

117
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,723
Is everything okay?

118
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,262
It's thundering.

119
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,163
Come on. Hop up.

120
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:39,966
I'm the wind and you're the feather.
Say good night to Mom.

121
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,372
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.

122
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:49,010
Here we go.

123
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:58,419
I don't like the tree, Dad.

124
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:03,050
That's an old tree.
It's been around here a long time.

125
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,757
It was here before my company
built the neighborhood.

126
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,766
I don't like its arms.

127
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:11,930
- It knows I live here, doesn't it?
- It knows everything about us.

128
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:15,167
That's why I built the house next to it,
so it could protect us.

129
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:18,472
You and Carol Anne
and Dana and your mom and me.

130
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:21,707
It's a very wise old tree.

131
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,342
It looks at me.
It knows I live here.

132
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,514
I think the storm's gonna pass us.

133
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,148
How do you know?

134
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:35,216
'Cause I can count.

135
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,523
You know what you do?

136
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,826
When you see the lightning...

137
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:43,299
you count 'til you hear the thunder.

138
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:46,929
If you can count higher each time,
that means the storm's movin' away.

139
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,506
Wanna try it?

140
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:53,400
We need some lightning.

141
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,181
Wait. It's comin'.

142
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:06,422
Okay, count.
One, two, three.

143
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,322
Next time, you'll be able to count
to at least four or five. Bet you.

144
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:15,160
Daddy, it's for you.

145
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:17,462
Tell them to take
a message, sweet pea.

146
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,366
My dad wants to take a message.

147
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,608
Night.

148
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,913
It's too hot.

149
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,075
Okay. Night, angel.

150
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,143
- Happy dreams, okay?
- Night, Daddy.

151
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:42,021
One...

152
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,650
two...

153
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:45,318
three...

154
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:56,329
I did not. Come on!

155
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,108
- Good night, Dana.
- Good night, Dad.

156
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:05,106
- Get off the phone, Dana.
- Okay, Dad.

157
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:13,787
One...

158
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,914
two...

159
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:17,016
Three...

160
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,082
four...

161
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,253
Five...

162
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:32,013
They're here.

163
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:48,428
Listen to me, Jeff.
No, I'm not kidding.

164
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:52,559
I know. How could anybody
sleep through a 6.5?

165
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:56,629
There was damage. Yeah, the bedroom.
There's stuff in pieces all over.

166
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:03,072
We're listening to the radio.
There's nothing on the radio at all.

167
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,810
You are so obnoxious!
You drive me nuts!

168
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,847
Force field.

169
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:16,824
- You are so obnoxious.
- Got my nose.

170
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:20,887
This means war, and I mean it!

171
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:26,490
- Hey, watch out.
- Honey, chew your food ten times.

172
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,628
You're a big barf bag.

173
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,899
You're a doggie bag.

174
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,675
- I won't eat it.
- There you go.

175
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:39,142
Sweetheart, last night
when you said, "They're here"...

176
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:41,445
Can I take my goldfish to school?

177
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:45,680
Maybe the fault line runs directly under
our house. Wouldn't that be a scream?

178
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,119
The ceiling got crumbs
all over my bed.

179
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:52,091
Remember last night when you woke up
and said, "They're here"?

180
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:56,153
Who did you mean?
Who's here?

181
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,131
The TV people.

182
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:01,468
- She's stoned.
- What do you know?

183
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:04,130
More than you! Ask Dad!

184
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:06,901
- "Ask Dad!"
- "Ask Dad!"

185
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:08,704
"Ask Dad!"

186
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,971
It's not my mess!

187
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:17,074
Thanks a lot, jerko.
I've got class in 20 minutes.

188
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,648
Give me this
before you cut yourself.

189
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:22,882
Did the earth move for you?

190
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,119
It wasn't quite the same
thing for us, Jeff. Huh?

191
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:29,560
Okay. Yeah, right. Okay.

192
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:35,097
- Give me that before you cut yourself.
- It's not my fault.

193
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,466
Bye, sweet pea.
I'm outta here.

194
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:39,904
- Bye, honey.
- I'm outta here.

195
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,305
- You I can handle.
- I got school.

196
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:46,039
- Well, breakfast first.
- All right. I'll just flunk.

197
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,466
It happens on every job.

198
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,439
Look at this!

199
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:19,972
I love that swing.

200
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:25,044
I love you. I love you.

201
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,844
I love it.

202
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:40,987
E. Buzz, no, no!
Get down.

203
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:46,265
Carol Anne, I've told you guys
to push your chairs in when you're done.

204
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:54,008
Honey, you're gonna ruin your eyes.
This is not good for you.

205
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:16,331
What's the matter?

206
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,059
What are you doing?

207
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:57,405
- How is it?
- Great, Mrs. Freeling.

208
00:28:57,473 --> 00:29:00,772
- Okay, Bluto, give me my cup.
- You sure make good coffee.

209
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:21,055
Oh, Jesus!
Don't do that, honey.

210
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,260
You wanna see Mommy lying in a cigar box
covered with licorice?

211
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,059
Did you do this?

212
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,666
You guys.

213
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:36,403
I asked you
not to pull the chairs out.

214
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,694
The TV people?

215
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,270
Do you see them?

216
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,488
Do you?

217
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:40,572
I think you're really
gonna enjoy this kitchen.

218
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:44,508
This is our latest development.
We call this phase four.

219
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,511
Where do you live, Mr. Freeling?

220
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:50,777
We were the first family to set up house
in the Cuesta Verde Estates.

221
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,374
Oh, phase one.

222
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:55,182
We had to pass through
my neighborhood to get here.

223
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:58,122
Oh, that area with
the lived-in look.

224
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,524
It has that, but in a couple of months
you won't be able to distinguish...

225
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:05,496
phase one from phase three to phase...

226
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:08,398
We have a saying around here.

227
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:11,198
"The grass grows greener
on every side."

228
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:16,703
- That's the way I feel about it.
- I can't tell one house from the other.

229
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:18,800
I think you're right.

230
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,711
But I think our construction standards
are really very liberal.

231
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:26,217
I have this neighbor, and he built
his Jacuzzi in his bedroom...

232
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,777
and it has a running aqueduct
connected to a wading pool outside.

233
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,449
It's built half in
and half out of his living room.

234
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,459
It was featured in last month's
issue of "Town and Country."

235
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,791
I'll show you the den.

236
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,139
Honey, come here, quick!

237
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,482
- Hurry, before it stops again!
- But the cans...

238
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,022
- Easy.
- All right.

239
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:13,759
Just stand right here, okay?

240
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:18,291
I've kept Dana and Robbie out of this,
but Carol Anne was here so she knows.

241
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,463
Dana would blab, and Robbie
would be up for three weeks.

242
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,406
I think you should sit down.

243
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,171
Now just stand, okay?

244
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,806
Now just be calm.

245
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,339
Now reach back into our past
when you used to have an open mind.

246
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,180
Remember that?

247
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:40,121
Just try to use that
for the next couple of minutes.

248
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,885
- Okay?
- Okay.

249
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,290
Mother didn't cook any dinner.

250
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:47,125
We'll go to Pizza Hut, okay?

251
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:49,324
Now just look.

252
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:51,867
Just look. Just watch.

253
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,803
Come here, sweetheart.

254
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,635
Honey, could you move
the chair out of the way...

255
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,939
and just stay down there?

256
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:38,104
- Let's show Daddy.
- I'm hungry.

257
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,273
Now don't argue with Mommy.

258
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,613
Let's just do this once.

259
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,978
Okay, here we go.

260
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:48,648
I want pepperoni pizza.

261
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:55,462
Mommy, that burns.

262
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,624
The floor needs more wax.
Steven, you do it.

263
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,690
Honey, try.

264
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,961
It's like there's this tickling...

265
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:07,030
right in here,
and it starts to pull you.

266
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:09,838
It pulls you, and suddenly
it's like there's no air...

267
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:13,779
except that you can breathe,
and you're getting pulled along...

268
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:17,010
- Hi, Ben.
- Mr. Tuthill, hi.

269
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:20,748
My TV's not on, so if you're
havin' problems with your set...

270
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:24,622
It's nothing like that.
Diane and I were just wondering...

271
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:28,218
- This will sound strange coming from me.
- I doubt that.

272
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:33,658
The mosquitoes are awful.

273
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:35,668
They're chowin' down.

274
00:34:35,736 --> 00:34:37,966
I've never been bothered by 'em.

275
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:41,201
I don't think I've ever
been bitten by one of 'em.

276
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:46,007
As far as I know, nobody in my family's
ever been affected by 'em.

277
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,013
Mosquito ever suck on you, son?

278
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,743
- I don't know, Dad.
- He don't know.

279
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:57,047
Look.

280
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:04,528
I'm sorry.

281
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:07,191
Uh, Mr. Tuthill, look.

282
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:10,702
We were just...
What we were wondering...

283
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,069
Diane, my wife,
and I were wondering, Ben...

284
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,439
somethin' funny's
goin' on here next door.

285
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,375
Somethin', uh...

286
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:23,040
We were wondering if maybe you had
experienced any disturbances lately.

287
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:25,981
What kind of disturbances?

288
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:30,283
Um, oh, you know, like...

289
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:33,985
dishes or furniture
moving around by themselves.

290
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,396
Don't scratch.
You're gonna infect 'em.

291
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:42,865
Just let me put this on.

292
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,903
- Don't.
- Boy, did I feel like a fool.

293
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,667
I'm sorry, but I had to say something.
We were losing blood.

294
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,335
- We'll keep this thing in the family.
- Don't scratch.

295
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,401
Tomorrow I'll call somebody.

296
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:57,971
Who, for instance?
I already looked in the Yellow Pages.

297
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:01,246
Furniture movers we got.
Strange phenomena, there's no listing.

298
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:06,186
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

299
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:08,953
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand...

300
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:11,689
five, one thousand...

301
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:13,788
Honey, look.

302
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:17,857
I lived with this freaky thing all day
and nothing bad happened.

303
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:22,804
It's like another side of nature, a side
that we're not qualified to understand.

304
00:36:22,873 --> 00:36:27,207
When you overreact, it makes
what happened much too important.

305
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:30,269
No one's goin' in the kitchen
'til I know what's happening.

306
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:34,980
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

307
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:37,316
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand...

308
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:47,322
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three...

309
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:54,528
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

310
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,474
Help me!

311
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:40,177
Help me!

312
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,912
- Help me, Dad!
- Be careful!

313
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:16,775
Dad, come on!

314
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,613
Help me!

315
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:24,917
He's coming!

316
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,619
It's taking me in!

317
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:28,252
- He's coming!
- It's hurting me!

318
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,457
- Steven, hurry!
- Dad, help me!

319
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:33,557
- Hold on!
- Hold on to him!

320
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:56,521
Hold me, Dad!

321
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,920
- I got him!
- My leg!

322
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:05,191
Dad, my leg!

323
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,896
Help me, Dad!

324
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,803
Look, Mom, Dad!
It's a tornado!

325
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:22,644
It must've just skimmed us.
There wouldn't be a house left if...

326
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:27,079
I left her upstairs!

327
00:39:31,256 --> 00:39:34,191
Baby, we're coming!

328
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:09,893
- I'll go check the kitchen.
- No! I'll do it!

329
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,951
You check your room.

330
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:31,113
Baby?

331
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:45,358
Sweetheart?

332
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:50,794
Baby?

333
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:03,769
Did you find her?

334
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,475
I've looked everywhere.
This is crazy.

335
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:10,843
Oh, my... My God.

336
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:14,551
The swimming pool.

337
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:23,855
Be careful, honey!

338
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:40,873
Mommy!

339
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:47,455
Nothing!

340
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,195
Thank God.

341
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:03,129
What?

342
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,431
Oh, Carol Anne, thank God! Baby!

343
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,371
Baby, where are you?

344
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:18,279
- Mommy, come over here!
- What is it?

345
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,320
What, baby?

346
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:28,358
I can't hear you, Mommy.

347
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,362
Where are you?

348
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:40,597
I can't hear you, Mommy!

349
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,608
Where are you?

350
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,682
What members of the household
are involved...

351
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:56,847
and what are their ages?

352
00:42:56,923 --> 00:43:00,415
There's Diane, my wife.
She's 31.

353
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,224
Uh, 32. I'm sorry.

354
00:43:03,296 --> 00:43:07,527
My oldest daughter, Dana.
She's 16.

355
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,592
My son, Robert, is eight.

356
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,973
Five.

357
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:20,671
Has there been any publicity
about these events?

358
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:22,680
Absolutely nothing.

359
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,146
Can you be reasonably sure...

360
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:28,846
of not letting any get started?

361
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:31,082
That's the last thing we want.

362
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,852
We haven't even gone to the police.

363
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:37,986
Would your family welcome...

364
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:42,363
a serious investigation
of these disturbances...

365
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:45,925
by someone who can make
firsthand observations?

366
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:49,701
Look, Dr. Lesh,
we don't care about the disturbances...

367
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:53,839
the pounding and the flashing...

368
00:43:53,912 --> 00:43:57,006
the screaming, the music.

369
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:01,881
We just want you
to find our little girl.

370
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:16,127
I guess I should warn you that...

371
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,465
we keep the room locked off
from the rest of the house.

372
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:28,010
Robbie's sleeping with us now, and Dana
spends a lot of time with friends.

373
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:31,809
How many disturbances
have you recorded in the room?

374
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:34,510
We don't go in the room anymore.

375
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:41,753
Mr. Freeling, we'll record
any psychotronic energy or event.

376
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:45,784
Yes, Ryan photographed an extraordinary
episode on a case in Redlands.

377
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:50,492
That's right. It was a child's toy,
a very small Matchbox vehicle.

378
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:53,627
It rolled seven feet
across a linoleum surface.

379
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:56,195
The duration of the event
was seven hours.

380
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:58,207
Seven hours for what?

381
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,834
For the vehicle
to complete the distance.

382
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:04,812
Of course, this would never
register on the naked eye...

383
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,371
but I have it recorded
on time-lapse camera.

384
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,641
It's fantastic.

385
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:50,751
We've been trying to
hold ourselves together as a family.

386
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:53,191
Of course,
no one's been sleeping much.

387
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:55,491
Steven has missed so much work.

388
00:45:55,563 --> 00:45:58,691
But he's been wonderful.
Really wonderful.

389
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:02,595
How long have you been
investigating haunted houses?

390
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:04,332
- Mrs. Freeling...
- Diane.

391
00:46:06,074 --> 00:46:10,670
The determination as to whether
your home is haunted is not very easy.

392
00:46:11,946 --> 00:46:14,243
What I meant to say was...

393
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:17,511
it might very well be
a poltergeist intrusion...

394
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:20,314
instead of a classic haunting.

395
00:46:21,522 --> 00:46:24,047
There's a difference?

396
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:26,092
Did you see that?

397
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,754
There'll be two more.
They travel in pairs.

398
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:30,626
Dr. Casey.

399
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:36,497
Gotta be quicker than that.

400
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:41,104
It's electrical.
You can smell the charge.

401
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:42,904
What about poltergeists?

402
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:48,312
Poltergeists are usually
associated with an individual.

403
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:51,282
Hauntings seem to be connected...

404
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,649
with an area,
a house, usually.

405
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:57,884
Poltergeist disturbances
have a fairly short duration.

406
00:46:57,957 --> 00:47:00,084
Perhaps a couple of months.

407
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,150
Hauntings can go on for years.

408
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:08,427
Are you telling me that all of this
could just suddenly end at any time?

409
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,833
Yes, it could.

410
00:47:10,903 --> 00:47:13,030
Unless it's a haunting.

411
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:15,836
But hauntings don't usually
revolve around living people.

412
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:20,504
Then we don't have much time, because
my daughter is alive in this house.

413
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:23,975
While trying to escape
from an unknown assailant.

414
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,747
Marshall is listed as critical
and under intensive care.

415
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,152
This is probably
gonna seem a little strange.

416
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,857
We hear better on this channel.

417
00:47:39,931 --> 00:47:41,922
Don't ask me why.

418
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:45,028
Well...

419
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:51,141
I guess I'll call her.

420
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,908
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

421
00:48:00,986 --> 00:48:03,750
We wanna talk to you.

422
00:48:11,362 --> 00:48:13,626
Please answer me, baby.

423
00:48:14,698 --> 00:48:16,632
Please answer me.

424
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:19,635
Please talk to me, bunny.

425
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,434
Look at the dog.

426
00:48:33,484 --> 00:48:35,247
Are you with us now?

427
00:48:37,521 --> 00:48:40,354
Can you say hello to Daddy?

428
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:50,265
Hello, Daddy.

429
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,204
Hello, sweet pea.

430
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:03,643
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

431
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:05,976
Hello, Mommy.

432
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:07,846
Hello, baby.

433
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:13,482
Can you see me?

434
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:16,654
Can you see Mommy?

435
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:23,859
Mommy, where are you?
Where are you?

436
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:27,197
We're home, baby.
We're home.

437
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:31,603
- Can you find a way home to us, baby?
- Mommy, where are you?

438
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:34,107
I can't find you!
I can't!

439
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:38,202
I'm afraid of the light, Mommy!

440
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,373
I'm afraid of the light!

441
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,041
Tell her to stay away
from the light!

442
00:49:43,118 --> 00:49:46,144
- Maybe it's a way out.
- It is, but not for her.

443
00:49:46,221 --> 00:49:49,816
Tell her quickly.

444
00:49:49,892 --> 00:49:52,759
- Stay away from the light!
- Tell her, Diane.

445
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:54,659
Stay away from the light!

446
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,164
The light is dangerous!
Don't go near it!

447
00:49:57,232 --> 00:50:00,598
- Don't even look at the light!
- I don't believe it.

448
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,330
The voice could be coming
from a CB transmitter.

449
00:50:03,404 --> 00:50:05,338
This isn't a hoax!

450
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:23,189
What the hell is this?

451
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:25,020
Anything?

452
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:29,153
- Nothing's registered.
- Mommy, there's somebody here.

453
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:36,893
Mommy, is that you?

454
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,837
No, it's not Mommy.
Who is it, Dr. Lesh?

455
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:42,704
- Who's with you, baby?
- Who's with you?

456
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:45,609
Somebody's coming!
Help me, please!

457
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:48,808
My God! My baby!

458
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:54,620
You bastards!
She's just a baby!

459
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:58,556
Help her!
Can't you hear what's happening?

460
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,616
Listen!

461
00:51:00,694 --> 00:51:03,595
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

462
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:07,155
Mommy, help me!

463
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,417
She just moved through me.

464
00:51:27,486 --> 00:51:29,511
My God!

465
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,681
I felt her.

466
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:37,025
I can smell her!

467
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:40,588
It's her!

468
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:43,396
Smell my clothes.
She's all over me.

469
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,061
- It's her.
- My God.

470
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:47,799
It's her. I felt her.

471
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:51,268
It is. It's her.

472
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,707
It is.

473
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:55,837
It's my baby.

474
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:59,976
She went through my soul.

475
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,906
I can't hear her anymore.
Honey?

476
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,053
Where exactly do you suppose
Carol Anne was playing...

477
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,953
when she vanished from sight?

478
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,721
Where was Carol Anne playing
when she disappeared?

479
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,289
Her bedroom closet.

480
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,061
Let's go up there.

481
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,295
They won't let you in.

482
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,032
We'll just see about that.

483
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,769
Whatever happened to you?

484
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,301
I was just about to check out
the kid's bedroom when... I don't know.

485
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,313
Something took a bite outta me.

486
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:06,746
You got bit?

487
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:11,253
- That or the world's worst muscle spasm.
- Let's have a look.

488
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,926
- Think we'll spend the night downstairs.
- No. Wrong.

489
00:53:17,993 --> 00:53:22,327
Honey, you take Dana and Robbie
and go and spend tonight in town.

490
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:24,923
I am not leaving here
without Carol Anne.

491
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,833
Mom, Dad, I can't stay here anymore.

492
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:30,235
You go, baby, go.

493
00:53:30,306 --> 00:53:33,275
I'm not gonna leave
anybody in this house alone.

494
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,284
Can we talk to you?

495
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,952
Let's go.

496
00:53:57,465 --> 00:54:00,764
- Any movement from those things?
- There's been some ionization flux.

497
00:54:00,835 --> 00:54:04,362
I'd like to make sure they're not caused
by humidity from structure leakage...

498
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:07,033
but I'm not goin' up there
to find out.

499
00:54:07,108 --> 00:54:10,373
We have got much more than the
paranormal episode taking place here.

500
00:54:10,445 --> 00:54:13,209
There is a measurable
physical science in this house...

501
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:17,240
that goes far beyond the creaking doors
or cold spots I've experienced.

502
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:20,377
The voice on television.
Where is it coming from?

503
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:24,413
The absence of a signal on a channel
that is not receiving a broadcast...

504
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:28,928
means that it can receive a lot of noise
from many things, like short waves.

505
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:31,624
Solar disturbances,
car ignition sparkings.

506
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:35,361
Outer space.
Or inner space.

507
00:54:37,304 --> 00:54:41,035
What if these people have an area
of bilocation in their own living room?

508
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:42,541
What do you mean?

509
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,702
If that is the way out...

510
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:49,144
then maybe somewhere in this house
there's a way in.

511
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,725
No, please.
Leave it on.

512
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:05,896
Thanks.

513
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:10,667
You know,
when it's quiet like now...

514
00:55:10,736 --> 00:55:14,297
I can imagine how all of this
must look from your side.

515
00:55:14,373 --> 00:55:16,841
I'm really embarrassed.

516
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:18,706
Nonsense.

517
00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:22,214
I'm the one who should be embarrassed
being here with you nice people.

518
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:26,251
Parapsychology isn't something
you master in.

519
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,810
There are no
certificates of graduation...

520
00:55:28,888 --> 00:55:32,153
no licenses to practice.

521
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:34,954
I am a professional psychologist.

522
00:55:35,026 --> 00:55:39,292
I spend most of my time
engaged in this ghostly hobby.

523
00:55:39,364 --> 00:55:43,664
Which makes me the most irresponsible
woman of my age that I know.

524
00:55:46,738 --> 00:55:49,434
Would you like a glass for that?

525
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:51,031
No, thank you.

526
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:57,981
You know, you were very funny.

527
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:00,609
Your hands were shaking
about a mile a minute.

528
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:06,047
This isn't over.

529
00:56:06,124 --> 00:56:08,524
I'm absolutely terrified.

530
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,590
It's all the things
that we don't understand.

531
00:56:19,336 --> 00:56:22,533
I feel like the protohuman,
coming out of the forest primeval...

532
00:56:22,606 --> 00:56:25,939
and seeing the moon for the first time
and throwing rocks at it.

533
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:29,411
If I got killed,
would I come back...

534
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,415
and get stuck in the house
like my sister?

535
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:34,246
Your sister isn't dead, Robbie.

536
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:36,252
If I got killed...

537
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,414
could I visit her
and show her how to get back here?

538
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,323
You could tie a rope around me
and hold it tight...

539
00:56:42,393 --> 00:56:46,921
then somebody could come and get us,
and we could live somewhere else.

540
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:51,426
Some people believe...

541
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:54,402
that when you die,
your soul goes to heaven.

542
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,461
When Grandpa was dead...

543
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:00,168
I looked at him in the hospital bed
and I was watching...

544
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,837
but I didn't see anything
go up out of him.

545
00:57:02,912 --> 00:57:06,040
His soul is invisible, Robbie.
You couldn't see it.

546
00:57:06,115 --> 00:57:09,050
But how come Grandpa isn't
on television with Carol Anne?

547
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:13,153
Some people believe
that when people die...

548
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:16,657
there's a wonderful light...

549
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,853
as bright as the sun...

550
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:21,954
but it doesn't hurt
to look into it.

551
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:25,625
All the answers to all the questions
that you ever want to know...

552
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:28,226
are inside that light.

553
00:57:28,303 --> 00:57:32,399
And when you walk to it,
you become a part of it forever.

554
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:36,267
And then, some people die...

555
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:38,836
but they don't know
that they've gone.

556
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:42,612
They think they're still alive?

557
00:57:45,487 --> 00:57:48,251
Maybe they didn't want to die.

558
00:57:48,323 --> 00:57:50,587
Maybe they weren't ready.

559
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,593
Maybe they hadn't
lived fully yet...

560
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:56,688
or they'd lived a long time,
but they still wanted more life.

561
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:00,098
They resist going into that light...

562
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:03,500
however hard the light wants them.

563
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:06,540
They just hang around...

564
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:10,839
watch TV,
watch their friends grow up...

565
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:14,403
feeling unhappy and jealous.

566
00:58:14,482 --> 00:58:17,315
Those feelings are bad.

567
00:58:17,385 --> 00:58:19,114
They hurt.

568
00:58:21,021 --> 00:58:23,251
And then...

569
00:58:23,324 --> 00:58:25,656
some people...

570
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:29,492
just get lost
on the way to the light...

571
00:58:29,563 --> 00:58:33,294
and they need someone
to guide them to it.

572
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,927
So some people get angry...

573
00:58:36,003 --> 00:58:38,665
and throw things around,
like in my bedroom?

574
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:43,675
Just like in school.

575
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:46,337
Like, some kids are nice to you...

576
00:58:46,413 --> 00:58:48,347
some kids are mean.

577
00:58:48,415 --> 00:58:51,111
I got beat up once
by three kids.

578
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:53,118
They took my lunch money.

579
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:56,519
Maybe they got hit by a truck,
and they're upstairs right now.

580
00:58:56,589 --> 00:59:00,525
Listen, partner, maybe we oughta
get some shut-eye, okay?

581
00:59:01,694 --> 00:59:03,184
You know what?

582
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:05,390
When we called Grandma tonight...

583
00:59:05,465 --> 00:59:08,366
she got really excited that
you're comin' to stay with her...

584
00:59:08,435 --> 00:59:12,462
and she's plannin' all these
neat things for you guys to do.

585
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:14,769
Can I take E. Buzz with me
when we go?

586
00:59:14,841 --> 00:59:17,172
Sure you can.

587
00:59:17,242 --> 00:59:19,608
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetie.

588
00:59:19,678 --> 00:59:21,339
Night, lady.

589
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:24,882
Night, Dad.

590
00:59:25,751 --> 00:59:27,343
Night, Rob.

591
00:59:28,554 --> 00:59:30,283
I love you.

592
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,983
Good night, Carol Anne.

593
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:34,874
I'm gonna go
get something to eat.

594
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:03,866
What is it?

595
01:06:20,888 --> 01:06:22,287
Roll it back.

596
01:06:27,595 --> 01:06:29,859
I think we got one.
I think it recorded.

597
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,431
Yes. It recorded.

598
01:06:56,256 --> 01:06:58,622
Look at all of them.

599
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:00,659
Is that our house?

600
01:07:04,364 --> 01:07:06,298
Who are all those people?

601
01:07:07,267 --> 01:07:10,395
They're so alone. So alone.

602
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:17,776
Where are they coming from?

603
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:20,878
I don't know.

604
01:07:54,212 --> 01:07:56,476
Call me, okay?

605
01:08:02,753 --> 01:08:05,017
This cameo is over
a hundred years old.

606
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,590
Yeah, some haul, huh?

607
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:11,150
And this watch is only
a few years old, and it's not yours.

608
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,625
Well, I'm off.

609
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:17,634
I'm taking these back to the lab
along with the tapes.

610
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:21,834
I'm going to have to
display these, you know.

611
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:24,898
- Please, not on "60 Minutes."
- Or "That's Incredible!"

612
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,911
I'll get it. Excuse me.

613
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,428
I'm leaving Ryan here with you.

614
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:52,592
Marty won't be coming back.

615
01:08:57,941 --> 01:09:00,136
I am coming back.

616
01:09:05,215 --> 01:09:07,274
And I'll bring some help.

617
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,284
Try not to worry.

618
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:15,017
Thank you.

619
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,081
We've missed you
down at the office.

620
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:21,892
The boys have gotten worried,
so I took it upon myself to...

621
01:09:21,964 --> 01:09:25,195
Jesus, Steve, you look like shit.
Aren't you feeling any better?

622
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:28,759
I'm still weak, Mr. Teague.
I've got the flu, I can't get up...

623
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:31,397
Looks like you got
some cable problems here.

624
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:34,567
Yeah. The cable's been off
for a couple of weeks.

625
01:09:34,643 --> 01:09:37,635
We'll have to look into that.
The rest of the block dark too?

626
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:41,114
No, just us.

627
01:09:41,183 --> 01:09:44,380
You got some electrical problems
as well here.

628
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:48,014
What have you got screwed in there,
a 300-watt bulb?

629
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,058
You afraid of burglars,
or are you trying to attract...

630
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:52,058
every insect in Cuesta Verde?

631
01:09:53,594 --> 01:09:56,620
- Steve, are you happy here?
- Yes, I am, sir.

632
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:58,824
Forgive me for asking
all these questions...

633
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,733
but we don't want to lose
the best rep we've ever had...

634
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:05,000
to the flu
or other opportunities.

635
01:10:05,073 --> 01:10:07,633
Seeing all that software
in your living room...

636
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:11,235
makes me wonder, maybe you've
got something going on the side.

637
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:13,837
No, I just read "Popular Mechanics."
I got hobbies.

638
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:15,906
Feel like going
for a little ride?

639
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:17,917
I'd like to show you something.

640
01:11:05,764 --> 01:11:10,201
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

641
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,897
One of your children
was born in your house, huh?

642
01:11:19,445 --> 01:11:23,245
I understand that she's
missed a lot of school.

643
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:27,081
One of Trask's daughters
is in the same nursery class.

644
01:11:27,153 --> 01:11:29,314
She got the flu as well, huh?

645
01:11:29,388 --> 01:11:31,356
Yeah, we've all got
the same thing.

646
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:32,583
I'm sorry.

647
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:37,026
- I didn't see her.
- She's around.

648
01:11:37,096 --> 01:11:40,896
I wonder if you'd mind
if I asked you a question.

649
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:43,331
Are you thinking about
leaving Cuesta Verde?

650
01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:48,299
How could anyone in the world
have a problem...

651
01:11:48,373 --> 01:11:50,307
on a day like this?

652
01:11:52,544 --> 01:11:55,240
How's that spot
for a bay window?

653
01:11:57,615 --> 01:12:00,175
It's pretty nice if you're
living up here, but...

654
01:12:01,286 --> 01:12:03,220
not so great
down in the valley...

655
01:12:03,288 --> 01:12:05,415
Iooking at homes
cutting into the hillside.

656
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,822
You don't have to live
in the valley anymore.

657
01:12:09,494 --> 01:12:11,121
What are you saying?

658
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:13,790
We're starting phase five
right here where we're standing.

659
01:12:13,865 --> 01:12:16,800
All of this can be
your master bedroom suite.

660
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:19,496
That can be your view.
Interested?

661
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:24,240
Well, Mr. Teague,
that's a generous offer.

662
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:29,174
- I'm just not a developer.
- You're responsible for 42% of sales.

663
01:12:29,246 --> 01:12:31,612
That's almost half
of everything down there.

664
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:35,140
Almost $70 million worth
of dwelling and properties.

665
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:37,653
That's a whole generation
of security...

666
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,951
that nobody
can put a price tag on.

667
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:44,426
I know we should have made you
a full partner three years ago.

668
01:12:44,494 --> 01:12:46,428
I don't want to lose you now.

669
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:55,994
Not much room
for a pool, is there?

670
01:12:56,073 --> 01:12:58,302
We own all the land.

671
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,434
We've already made arrangements
for relocating the cemetery.

672
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,643
You're kidding me.

673
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,445
- That's sacrilegious, isn't it?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

674
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:12,146
After all, it's not ancient
tribal burial ground.

675
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,519
It's just... people.

676
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,816
Besides, we've done it before.

677
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,388
When?

678
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:23,398
In '76. Right down there.

679
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:30,638
Cuesta Verde?

680
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:33,573
All 300 acres.
It was quite a deal.

681
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:35,701
But I never heard
anything about it.

682
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:38,302
It's not something
one advertises on a billboard...

683
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,314
or on the side of a bus.

684
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:43,579
Don't worry. Friends and relatives
can visit their loved ones...

685
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,586
in Broxton Memorial Park.

686
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,645
It's only five minutes further.

687
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:50,452
Oh, yeah. Five minutes.
That's no great hardship.

688
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,528
I suppose that would be okay.

689
01:13:55,797 --> 01:13:57,059
Okay with whom?

690
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:00,457
Whomever might complain.

691
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,938
Nobody's complained until now.

692
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:27,918
We've had two experiences
in the kitchen. This is the den.

693
01:14:38,872 --> 01:14:40,840
Y'all mind hangin' back?

694
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:42,842
You're jammin' my frequencies.

695
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:36,051
So... what side of the rainbow
are we working tonight, Dr. Lesh?

696
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:42,163
- This your Knott's Berry Farm solution?
- I know what you're thinking.

697
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:46,466
But you must take my word for it.
She's cleaned many houses.

698
01:15:46,538 --> 01:15:48,472
Her gifts have been documented...

699
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,838
We haven't heard Carol Anne
since last night.

700
01:15:50,909 --> 01:15:53,036
Why is this door locked,
Mr. Freeling?

701
01:15:57,616 --> 01:15:59,743
- Answer her, Steven.
- I am.

702
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,787
I am addressing the living.

703
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:07,491
I'm sorry.

704
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:09,992
That's the room
my son and daughter used to occupy.

705
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,028
We believe it's the heart
of the house.

706
01:16:12,096 --> 01:16:14,462
This house has many hearts.

707
01:16:16,834 --> 01:16:18,893
- What is the matter?
- What's the matter?

708
01:16:21,572 --> 01:16:24,268
I was trying to answer her
with my mind...

709
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:26,366
and she couldn't hear me.

710
01:16:26,444 --> 01:16:29,470
I thought you said this Tangina Barrons
was an extraordinary clairvoyant.

711
01:16:29,547 --> 01:16:30,878
I am.

712
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:35,785
I just don't like trick answers.

713
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:46,019
Come here, honey...

714
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:48,964
and give me your hand.

715
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,334
I'm not gonna bite you.

716
01:17:03,213 --> 01:17:07,149
Come on down here. You'll give me
a whiplash lookin' up at you.

717
01:17:12,722 --> 01:17:16,055
Your daughter is alive
and in this house.

718
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,405
Where was the last incident
of bilocation?

719
01:17:38,514 --> 01:17:41,005
I get my strongest feelin'...

720
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:45,452
the point of origin is in
the child's closet upstairs.

721
01:17:46,355 --> 01:17:49,552
Yes. I believe that too.

722
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:54,562
Honey, you're gonna be strong for me
and for your daughter.

723
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:58,326
I can do absolutely nothing
without your faith in this world...

724
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,458
and your love for the children.

725
01:18:00,535 --> 01:18:03,026
I will.
Believe me, I will.

726
01:18:03,104 --> 01:18:06,835
And will you do anything I ask,
even if it comes contrary...

727
01:18:06,908 --> 01:18:10,036
to your beliefs as a human being
and a Christian?

728
01:18:10,111 --> 01:18:12,636
Yes, I promise. Please!

729
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,654
Would you all come on in?

730
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:23,785
Gather 'round.

731
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:30,497
There is no death.

732
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:37,134
It is only a transition to
a different sphere of consciousness.

733
01:18:37,203 --> 01:18:41,435
Carol Anne is not like those
she's with.

734
01:18:42,842 --> 01:18:45,504
She is a living presence...

735
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:48,980
in their spiritual earthbound plane.

736
01:18:49,049 --> 01:18:52,917
They are attracted
to the one thing about her...

737
01:18:52,986 --> 01:18:58,117
that is different from themselves...
her life force.

738
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:00,751
It is very strong.

739
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:04,228
It gives off
its own illumination.

740
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:07,789
It is a light that implies life...

741
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:10,266
and memory of love and home...

742
01:19:11,704 --> 01:19:13,638
and earthly pleasures...

743
01:19:14,907 --> 01:19:17,705
something they
desperately desire...

744
01:19:18,777 --> 01:19:20,836
but can't have anymore.

745
01:19:22,448 --> 01:19:25,781
Right now, she's the closest thing
to that...

746
01:19:27,052 --> 01:19:30,852
and that is
a terrible distraction...

747
01:19:30,923 --> 01:19:34,950
from the real light
that has finally come for them.

748
01:19:36,228 --> 01:19:38,287
Do you understand me?

749
01:19:41,533 --> 01:19:47,095
These souls, who for
whatever reason are not at rest...

750
01:19:47,171 --> 01:19:50,572
are also not aware
that they have passed on.

751
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:55,609
They're not part of consciousness
as we know it.

752
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,979
They linger in
a perpetual dream state...

753
01:20:00,118 --> 01:20:03,212
a nightmare from which
they cannot awake.

754
01:20:04,355 --> 01:20:09,349
Inside the spectral light
is salvation...

755
01:20:10,595 --> 01:20:13,462
a window to the next plane.

756
01:20:13,531 --> 01:20:15,692
They must pass through
this membrane...

757
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:19,999
where friends are waiting
to guide them to new destinies.

758
01:20:21,639 --> 01:20:24,937
Carol Anne must help them
cross over...

759
01:20:25,008 --> 01:20:29,877
and she will only hear
her mother's voice.

760
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,576
Now...

761
01:20:35,686 --> 01:20:37,916
hold on to yourselves.

762
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,127
There's one more thing.

763
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:48,893
A terrible presence
is in there with her.

764
01:20:49,866 --> 01:20:54,269
So much rage.
So much betrayal.

765
01:20:54,337 --> 01:20:57,500
I've never sensed
anything like it.

766
01:20:58,809 --> 01:21:01,936
I don't know
what hovers over this house...

767
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:05,777
but it was strong enough to punch
a hole into this world...

768
01:21:05,848 --> 01:21:07,816
and take your daughter
away from you.

769
01:21:09,785 --> 01:21:13,687
It keeps Carol Anne
very close to it...

770
01:21:13,756 --> 01:21:16,088
and away from the spectral light.

771
01:21:16,992 --> 01:21:19,552
It lies to her.

772
01:21:19,628 --> 01:21:23,826
It says things
only a child can understand.

773
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:27,357
It has been usin' her
to restrain the others.

774
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:34,402
To her, it simply is
another child.

775
01:21:36,746 --> 01:21:40,579
To us, it is the beast.

776
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:57,689
Now let's go get your daughter.

777
01:22:02,437 --> 01:22:06,635
Red ribbons,
handkerchiefs, tennis balls.

778
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:08,642
Okay, rope's ready.

779
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:11,577
- Bathwater?
- I shut it off. It's ready too.

780
01:22:11,646 --> 01:22:14,615
All right. Call to her.

781
01:22:24,558 --> 01:22:26,822
Carol Anne, it's Mommy.
Can you hear me?

782
01:22:31,598 --> 01:22:33,759
Carol Anne,
please tell Mommy hello.

783
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,837
Try again.

784
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,631
Can you say hello to Daddy?

785
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:45,208
Daddy and I miss you so much.

786
01:22:46,446 --> 01:22:49,279
So much. We love you so much.

787
01:22:49,349 --> 01:22:51,510
Please, just say hello.

788
01:22:51,585 --> 01:22:54,280
- She's under restraint.
- What?

789
01:22:54,353 --> 01:22:57,220
- Who's restraining her?
- There are many arms about her.

790
01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:01,989
She thinks it's safe. Who is she more
threatened by, you or your husband?

791
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:04,962
Neither. Steve decides
the punishment the children...

792
01:23:05,031 --> 01:23:06,965
That's not fair.
I've never laid a hand...

793
01:23:07,033 --> 01:23:10,264
Fight about it later.
Steven, make Carol Anne answer you.

794
01:23:13,606 --> 01:23:15,540
Be cross with her.

795
01:23:15,608 --> 01:23:17,303
It's Daddy.

796
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,970
Be angry with her,
or you'll never see her again.

797
01:23:20,046 --> 01:23:22,640
Carol Anne, I want you
to answer me.

798
01:23:22,715 --> 01:23:25,809
Tell her if she doesn't answer you,
she'll get a spankin'.

799
01:23:25,885 --> 01:23:28,854
- I've never spanked the children.
- Honey, please. Just tell her.

800
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,450
Carol Anne,
you answer your parents...

801
01:23:34,526 --> 01:23:36,994
or you're gonna get
a real spanking from the both of us!

802
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:39,155
Mommy! Help me!

803
01:23:40,365 --> 01:23:44,301
- She's away from him.
- From whom? Is she all right?

804
01:23:44,369 --> 01:23:46,303
Diane, ask about the light.

805
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:51,232
Mommy, help me, please!

806
01:23:53,311 --> 01:23:56,280
- Honey, do you see a light?
- Help me, please!

807
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:58,282
Mommy! Help me!

808
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:01,114
Tell her to go to the light.

809
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:05,551
They'll follow her. They've been
followin' her for weeks.

810
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,592
- You must do what I say!
- Tell her, Diane.

811
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:11,628
Mommy, I can't find you!

812
01:24:11,695 --> 01:24:14,664
Run to the light!
Run as fast as you can!

813
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:16,666
- I am in the light!
- No, honey.

814
01:24:16,734 --> 01:24:18,827
- Tell her you are.
- No, it's a lie!

815
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:22,498
You can't choose between life and death
when dealin' with what is in between.

816
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:24,507
Tell her before it's too late.

817
01:24:25,309 --> 01:24:27,777
Run to the light, baby.

818
01:24:27,845 --> 01:24:30,439
- Mommy is in the light.
- Tell her you're waiting for her.

819
01:24:30,514 --> 01:24:33,711
Mommy is waiting for you in the light.
I hate you for this.

820
01:24:34,952 --> 01:24:38,251
Now clear your minds.
It knows what scares you.

821
01:24:38,322 --> 01:24:40,654
It has from the very beginning.

822
01:24:40,724 --> 01:24:43,318
Don't give it any help.
It knows too much already.

823
01:24:44,828 --> 01:24:46,852
Now, open the door.

824
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:27,398
Ryan, get downstairs
and wait by the target!

825
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:34,732
Give me the tennis ball
marked number 1!

826
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:14,841
Dr. Lesh! It's my handwriting!
It came right out of thin air!

827
01:26:16,017 --> 01:26:18,884
The ball came back.
It's his handwriting!

828
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:28,422
Kiss my ass!

829
01:26:28,496 --> 01:26:30,191
Number 2!

830
01:26:31,465 --> 01:26:33,660
Give me your hand!

831
01:26:56,656 --> 01:26:59,557
She's at the mouth
of the corridor!

832
01:26:59,626 --> 01:27:04,290
Tell her to stop!
Tell her not to go into the light!

833
01:27:06,566 --> 01:27:11,503
Listen to me.
Do not go into the light.

834
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:14,596
Stop where you are.
Turn away from it.

835
01:27:14,673 --> 01:27:16,470
Don't even look at it.

836
01:27:16,542 --> 01:27:19,067
Hurry with the rope!

837
01:27:22,848 --> 01:27:25,339
Throw it into the light!

838
01:27:33,392 --> 01:27:35,326
Fantastic.

839
01:27:36,395 --> 01:27:37,589
I got it!

840
01:27:39,031 --> 01:27:42,831
Tell him
to take up the slack gently.

841
01:27:42,901 --> 01:27:44,300
Take up the slack!

842
01:27:45,204 --> 01:27:47,138
Take up the slack!

843
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:15,658
Help me tie this around my waist!

844
01:28:15,733 --> 01:28:17,166
What are you doing?

845
01:28:17,235 --> 01:28:20,363
I'm goin' in after her!

846
01:28:20,438 --> 01:28:23,168
She won't come to you!
Let me go!

847
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:25,971
You've never done this before!

848
01:28:26,043 --> 01:28:27,635
Neither have you!

849
01:28:28,713 --> 01:28:30,703
You're right. You go.

850
01:28:31,715 --> 01:28:33,046
No! Let me!

851
01:28:33,116 --> 01:28:36,244
You can't! Who's strong enough
to stay here and hold the rope?

852
01:29:02,812 --> 01:29:04,780
I love you!

853
01:29:04,848 --> 01:29:09,784
No! Go downstairs
and wait by Ryan...

854
01:29:09,852 --> 01:29:12,514
and pull only when I say so!

855
01:29:12,588 --> 01:29:14,522
Only when I say.

856
01:29:51,559 --> 01:29:53,493
Don't let go!

857
01:29:54,395 --> 01:29:55,327
Never!

858
01:30:05,473 --> 01:30:06,735
It's coming.

859
01:30:06,808 --> 01:30:09,140
How will we know she's got her?

860
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:12,179
When will we know?

861
01:30:26,493 --> 01:30:29,053
Cross over, children.

862
01:30:29,129 --> 01:30:31,393
All are welcome.

863
01:30:31,465 --> 01:30:33,899
All welcome.

864
01:30:33,967 --> 01:30:36,026
Go into the light.

865
01:30:37,204 --> 01:30:38,501
You said, "No"!

866
01:30:38,572 --> 01:30:43,202
There is peace and serenity
in the light.

867
01:30:43,277 --> 01:30:45,211
You said don't go into the light!

868
01:30:54,921 --> 01:30:57,048
Steven, not yet!

869
01:31:15,274 --> 01:31:17,435
- They're here!
- They're back!

870
01:31:19,445 --> 01:31:21,743
Diane! No, please, no!

871
01:31:21,814 --> 01:31:23,543
Get 'em into the water!

872
01:31:23,616 --> 01:31:26,312
- Oh, God!
- No, I'm helping you!

873
01:31:26,385 --> 01:31:27,317
Don't worry.

874
01:31:33,759 --> 01:31:36,158
Get 'em in the water.
She's gonna be all right.

875
01:31:42,334 --> 01:31:44,928
Come on. Breathe now.

876
01:31:45,003 --> 01:31:48,939
Just take a breath.
Breathe.

877
01:31:49,007 --> 01:31:50,907
Breathe. Damn it, breathe!

878
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:55,101
Breathe!

879
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:58,047
That's it. Come on.

880
01:31:58,116 --> 01:32:01,017
Come on. Breathe. Yeah.
That's it. Breathe.

881
01:32:11,763 --> 01:32:13,127
Baby.

882
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,233
Sweetheart.

883
01:32:19,937 --> 01:32:23,100
Sweet pea, it's Daddy.
Come on, honey.

884
01:32:23,173 --> 01:32:25,107
Come on, pumpkin.

885
01:32:30,347 --> 01:32:31,609
Hi, Daddy.

886
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:54,092
This house is clean.

887
01:33:12,488 --> 01:33:13,921
Be careful.

888
01:33:19,429 --> 01:33:21,363
Mom, I'm going to dinner
with Janice and Brian.

889
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:24,332
- Is your room packed up?
- Everything but the bed.

890
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,358
- Are we gonna sleep here tonight?
- I guess not.

891
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:32,669
So you better get Brian
to bring you home right after dinner.

892
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:36,199
Dad wants us to stay
at the Holiday Inn on I-74.

893
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:38,678
Oh, yeah.
I remember that place.

894
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:39,805
You what?

895
01:33:40,882 --> 01:33:42,873
Are you gonna do anything
about this?

896
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:45,419
- About what?
- Your new gray?

897
01:33:45,487 --> 01:33:48,456
Oh. You don't like it?

898
01:33:48,523 --> 01:33:50,991
You don't think
it's kind of punk?

899
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:52,686
Bye, Mom.

900
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:57,430
Honey, I don't know.

901
01:33:59,434 --> 01:34:01,402
Okay, Rob.
That thing almost killed me.

902
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,140
You okay?
Don't hurt your back.

903
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,843
How you feelin'?

904
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:12,538
Oh, I'm good.

905
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,138
I feel a little hungover,
like I've been asleep for a few days...

906
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:18,379
but... I feel good, Steven,
I really do.

907
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:26,026
She doesn't seem
to remember any of it.

908
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,621
Oh, what a day.

909
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,133
Smell that mimosa.

910
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:37,432
You better cut a bouquet and
take it with you. We're not stayin'.

911
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,598
I know.

912
01:34:41,941 --> 01:34:43,932
We worked so hard for this.

913
01:34:45,144 --> 01:34:47,112
A thousand beautiful memories.

914
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,741
I gotta go to the office, pick up
some stuff, clean up a few things.

915
01:34:50,917 --> 01:34:52,441
I'll be back early.

916
01:34:52,519 --> 01:34:54,384
We're leaving tonight for sure?

917
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:56,445
Yeah, we are.

918
01:34:56,523 --> 01:34:59,583
If the kids get sleepy,
let 'em sleep 'til I get home.

919
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,850
How's Teague taking it?

920
01:35:01,928 --> 01:35:04,590
You know Teague. He won't take
"Go to hell" for an answer.

921
01:35:04,664 --> 01:35:06,757
- What will you tell him?
- I'll give him directions.

922
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:40,790
"...colored mixture generously
directly from applicator to hair.

923
01:35:40,866 --> 01:35:42,800
- Gently work it through..."
- Let me have that.

924
01:35:42,868 --> 01:35:45,530
I want my truck back. Stop!

925
01:35:47,306 --> 01:35:48,568
That's my truck!

926
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,164
Gimme it.

927
01:35:53,478 --> 01:35:56,242
"Gently work it through with fingers
to saturate every strand.

928
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:59,078
Then comb through
with a brush and a comb...

929
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:01,914
to be sure entire width
of every hair is wet.

930
01:36:01,986 --> 01:36:03,510
Do not lather."

931
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:37,651
- Get out of the solar system.
- Gimme it.

932
01:36:37,721 --> 01:36:39,848
- It's getting late, guys.
- Gimme it.

933
01:36:39,923 --> 01:36:41,891
- Give it back to me.
- Give it.

934
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:44,950
- Stop it.
- I'm gonna be in the bathtub.

935
01:36:45,028 --> 01:36:47,189
Could you answer the phone...

936
01:36:47,764 --> 01:36:50,289
Could you answer the phone
for me, please?

937
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:52,392
And can you
tuck yourselves in, please?

938
01:36:53,069 --> 01:36:54,559
Yes, we will.

939
01:36:54,638 --> 01:36:57,072
Thank you.
Good night, sweetheart.

940
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,903
- See what you get?
- Good night.

941
01:37:12,721 --> 01:37:15,656
- Good night, Robbie.
- Good night, Carol Anne.

942
01:40:11,329 --> 01:40:12,762
You're not real!

943
01:40:17,168 --> 01:40:18,657
Oh! Help!

944
01:40:18,735 --> 01:40:21,101
Help me!

945
01:40:34,318 --> 01:40:38,049
You're not real!

946
01:40:39,356 --> 01:40:42,086
Let me go!

947
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:48,895
I hate you!

948
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:50,729
You're done! I hate you!

949
01:40:50,801 --> 01:40:52,530
I hate you!

950
01:40:52,603 --> 01:40:54,537
I hate you!

951
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:00,975
Carol Anne, Robbie, run!

952
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:38,244
Open the door!

953
01:41:38,313 --> 01:41:40,247
Carol Anne, Robbie, run!

954
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:45,010
Don't touch my babies!

955
01:41:56,564 --> 01:41:59,795
You...
Help me, somebody!

956
01:42:12,913 --> 01:42:13,937
No more.

957
01:42:16,283 --> 01:42:19,514
Mr. Tuthill!

958
01:42:19,586 --> 01:42:24,182
Ben! Help!
Please help me!

959
01:42:24,258 --> 01:42:27,227
Somebody help me! Please!

960
01:43:57,616 --> 01:44:01,108
Listen!
What sort of sound is that?

961
01:44:01,185 --> 01:44:02,880
I've got to get them!
Come on!

962
01:44:02,953 --> 01:44:06,252
- What's going on?
- Don't go!

963
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:09,121
- Please, Ben! Help me!
- No, don't go!

964
01:44:09,193 --> 01:44:11,161
Help me!

965
01:44:12,897 --> 01:44:16,993
Get away from my babies!
Get away!

966
01:44:39,689 --> 01:44:40,986
Help!

967
01:45:03,713 --> 01:45:05,681
Give me your hand!

968
01:45:09,285 --> 01:45:11,219
Give me your hand!

969
01:45:15,191 --> 01:45:17,021
I can't reach you!

970
01:45:25,067 --> 01:45:28,230
- Now grab your sister!
- Take my hand!

971
01:45:28,303 --> 01:45:29,634
Come on!

972
01:45:29,705 --> 01:45:31,570
Hold on!

973
01:45:34,643 --> 01:45:38,204
God, help me!

974
01:46:15,616 --> 01:46:17,106
Help us!

975
01:46:38,939 --> 01:46:42,966
You moved the cemetery,
but you left the bodies, didn't you?

976
01:46:43,043 --> 01:46:47,377
You son of a bitch! You left the bodies
and you only moved the headstones!

977
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:49,642
You only moved the headstones!

978
01:46:49,716 --> 01:46:52,583
Why?

979
01:47:10,703 --> 01:47:13,194
Hurry, Dad, hurry!

980
01:47:14,506 --> 01:47:16,599
- Dad, hurry!
- Come on.

981
01:47:16,675 --> 01:47:18,768
Hurry.

982
01:47:23,349 --> 01:47:27,251
- Hurry, Dad!
- Come on. Damn it, Steven, hurry!

983
01:47:43,235 --> 01:47:45,532
What's happening?

984
01:47:45,603 --> 01:47:47,764
What's happening?

985
01:47:47,839 --> 01:47:49,670
What's happening?

986
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:52,468
- Get in the car!
- What is it?

987
01:47:52,543 --> 01:47:54,773
Drive away! Daddy, drive away!

988
01:47:57,515 --> 01:47:59,039
Steven, hurry!

989
01:48:00,385 --> 01:48:02,148
The house is coming!

990
01:48:03,521 --> 01:48:05,682
- Faster!
- Don't look back! 
