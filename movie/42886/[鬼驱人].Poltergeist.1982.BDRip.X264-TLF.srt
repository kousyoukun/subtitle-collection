1
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,897
喂?
Hello?

2
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,778
你长什么样?
What do you look like?

3
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,618
大声点
Talk louder!

4
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,494
我听不到
I can't hear you!

5
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,246
嘿,喂!
Hey, hello!

6
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,957
喂!我听不到你说话
Hello! I can't hear you!

7
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,139
5个
Five.

8
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,688
不知道
I don't know.

9
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,984
我不知道
I don't know.

10
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:49,556
让她精神集中点! 我来了
Get her in focus! Here I come!

11
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,937
开门,糟了
Open up! Shit!

12
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:09,113
上帝啊,你怎么--?
Jesus H. Christ!
What are you--?

13
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:14,702
怎么了?
What happened?

14
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,126
现在他有压力了,他拿到了球
Now he's got pressure.
He has a receiver!

15
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:29,047
当需要放松时
When it's time to relax

16
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:31,716
一罐啤酒足矣
One beer stands clear

17
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,301
哦,该死的
Oh, damn it!

18
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:48,146
特悌?
Tweety?

19
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,615
哦,该死,特悌,你就不能再等一个教学日吗?
Oh, shit, Tweety! Couldn't you
have waited for a school day?

20
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:09,581
请不要
Won't you please

21
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,207
请不要
Please won't you be

22
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,459
这家伙是谁?
Who the hell is this guy?

23
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,878
发生什么了?
What the hell's going on?

24
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:21,008
富勒里, 怎么回事?
Freeling, what's goin' on here?

25
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,094
我道歉
我邻居也是同一个频段
I apologize!
My neighbor's on the same remote!

26
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:29,640
我为这场比赛连命都赌上了,你开玩笑吧
I bet my life on this game!
Are you kiddin' me?

27
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,644
本,我们那正在放一场精彩的球赛
Hi, Ben. We got a good
football game goin' on here.

28
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:37,354
我的孩子要看"罗杰先生"
My kids wanna watch
"Mr. Rogers."

29
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,983
我不在乎你要看什么,你就算是可怜可怜我们
I don't care what you're watchin'!
Just show some mercy with that thing!

30
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,112
别啊,史迪夫
Come on, Steve!

31
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,405
把你的遥控器拿开
Move your set.

32
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,369
- 拿开,本
- 就这样,别换了
- Move yours, Ben.
- There it is. Don't move.

33
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,132
特悌不喜欢这个味道
Tweety doesn't like that smell.

34
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:03,010
甜心,特悌闻不到什么味道
Sweetheart,
Tweety can't smell a thing.

35
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,720
给他献朵花吧
Put a flower with him.

36
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,763
一朵花?
A flower?

37
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,773
为了他生气的时候
For when he's hungry.

38
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:25,320
为了他不再孤单
For when he's lonely.

39
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,032
为了他将度过的长夜.
For when it's nighttime.

40
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:39,624
没事了
Oh, it's okay.

41
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:18,699
现在我躺下长眠...
Now I lay me down to sleep...

42
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:21,909
我祈祷主宽恕我的灵魂
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

43
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:23,911
- 哦,天哪
- 忍着点
- Oh, brother.
- Stifle it.

44
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:27,372
如果我在醒来之际死去...
If I should die before I wake...

45
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:28,915
会的
It did.

46
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,626
我请求主带走我的灵魂
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

47
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:34,253
你这样很可爱,很可爱
That was lovely.
Lovely, honey.

48
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,656
妈,等尸体腐烂之后能把骨头挖出来吗?
Mom, when it rots,
can we dig up the bones?

49
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:41,534
罗比,你就不能从树上下来?
Robbie! Will you come
on down out of the tree?

50
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,535
E. Buzz!
E. Buzz!

51
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,246
我们现在能养条金鱼了吗
Can I have a goldfish now?

52
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,377
来吃啊
Come and get it.

53
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,713
来吃啊
Come and get it.

54
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,135
你把他们喂的太饱了
You're overfeeding them.

55
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:54,137
二十二和二十三还想要
Tweety Two and Tweety Three
want seconds.

56
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:56,972
你知道怎么回事吗,你喂的太多了?
You know what happens
when you overfeed goldfish?

57
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,061
他们要长成...鲨鱼
They grow up to be... sharks!

58
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:09,900
晚安
Good night.

59
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:17,073
妈妈.有大风暴要来了
Mom, there's a big storm
headed this way.

60
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:19,783
如果你们快点
风暴在你们入睡之后才会来
You'll be asleep by the time
it gets here if you hurry.

61
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,327
来,到被子里去
Come on. In you go.

62
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,165
晚安,宝贝
Good night, sweetie.

63
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,626
好,关灯了
Okay, lights out.

64
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,754
灯灭了!
Closet light!

65
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,755
我的错
My fault.

66
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,299
开灯,妈妈
Turn it on, Mommy!

67
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:46,931
够了吧?
That enough?

68
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:51,102
- 行吧?
- 晚安,妈
- Okay?
- Good night, Mom.

69
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,769
晚安.妈妈
Night, Mommy.

70
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,943
晚安
Good night.

71
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,827
我死了或是疯了
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.

72
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:14,329
皮特,你没有疯
You're not crazy, Pete.

73
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:17,540
那你是说我死了?
You mean I'm dead?

74
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,251
我--
I'm--

75
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,922
你是说--
你是说这是好事?
You mean--
You mean this is for good?

76
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,674
梦游啊
Sleepwalking.

77
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:31,510
晚上的梦游症,你不知道吗?
Nocturnal somnambulism.
You know what?

78
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:34,680
我跟你打赌,这是遗传的
I will bet you anything
it's genetic.

79
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:40,101
卡罗尔昨晚就是,整个星期的晚上都在梦游
I mean, Carol Anne last night
and all last week.

80
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,395
我十岁的时候也是
And me when I was ten.

81
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,941
- 你能搞定这个吗?
- 好
- Would you deal with this?
- Sure.

82
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:54,988
你知道..
You know...

83
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:59,284
一次我梦游外出...
once I slept-walked four blocks...

84
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,413
在一个伙计的车的后座上睡着了
and I fell asleep
in the back of this guy's car.

85
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:09,709
你一直开着车,去工作也没发现我
He drove all the way to work
before discovering me.

86
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:12,586
天,然后我醒来了,开始狂叫
God, I woke up,
I started screaming.

87
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,672
人们跑过来,叫了警察
People came running, called the cops.

88
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:19,176
警察把这个可怜的花花公子带到市区
The cops took
this poor dude downtown.

89
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:23,179
- 我父亲, Ed--
-Big.
- My father, Ed--
- Big.

90
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:28,475
Big Ed 还检查了我有没有受伤,
有没有被侮辱
Big Ed has me examined
for bruises and hickeys.

91
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,853
天啊,真是太尴尬了
God, I was so embarrassed!

92
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,732
哦,天,史迪夫
Oh, shit, Steve.

93
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,318
如果我们挖个水池.你知道...
What if we dig the pool,
you know...

94
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:44,030
在没有水之前,卡罗尔梦游时掉进去了会怎么样?
and Carol Anne sleepwalks and falls
into it before there's any water?

95
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:46,198
哦,亲爱的,别这样
Oh, honey, no.

96
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:50,077
甜心,你滑过3米长的滑板吗?
Have you ever dove off
a three-meter board, sweetheart?

97
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:53,663
- 三米是多少?
- 十英尺
- What's three meters?
- It's about ten feet.

98
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:58,459
我们把水池挖的离屋子近点
这样孩子们就可以从屋顶上跳下去了
Let's dig the pool closer to the house
and let the kids jump off the roof.

99
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,044
别,亲爱的
No, honey, honey, honey.

100
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,923
甜心,3米长的滑板就像个空气袋
A three-meter board is like
an air pocket, sweetheart.

101
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,759
当你跳水时就像自由落体一样?
When you dive off,
it's like free-falling, okay?

102
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,929
你要站好位置,3米远
You gotta get your feet in position.
Three meters.

103
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,514
亲爱的,你的跳水生涯已经结束了
Honey, your diving days are over.

104
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,642
我们在谈论奥林匹克,达尼,知道吧
We're talkin' Olympics,
Diane, okay?

105
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:23,062
让我看看你的起跳位置
Let me see your tuck position.

106
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,774
我们像天鹅一样展开
We can jackknife into the swan.

107
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,777
收缩,转身...
Twist, turn...

108
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,322
然后跳出去
and splash!

109
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:38,785
亲爱的,去鹦鹉螺号是对的
Honey, it's right to
the Nautilus machine.

110
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:41,953
看这个,收缩,伸展
Look at this, honey.
Before, after.

111
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,289
收缩,伸展
Before, after.
Before, after.

112
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,433
- 别了
- 我爱你
- Don't.
- I love you.

113
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,488
天,我喜欢你说脏话的样子
Oh, God, I love it
when you talk dirty!

114
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,741
风暴越来越近了
Storm is coming closer.

115
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:20,911
嘿, 搭档.
Hey, partner.

116
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,330
嘿,亲爱的
Hi, honey.

117
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:24,873
一切还好吧?
Is everything okay?

118
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,378
在打雷
It's thundering.

119
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:33,297
来,起来
Come on. Hop up.

120
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:40,053
你是风,我是风中的羽毛
跟妈妈说晚安
I'm the wind and you're the feather.
Say good night to Mom.

121
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:42,513
- 晚安.妈妈
- 晚安,宝贝
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.

122
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,102
走咯
Here we go.

123
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,526
我不喜欢那根树
I don't like the tree, Dad.

124
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:03,197
那是根老树了,在这很久了
That's an old tree.
It's been around here a long time.

125
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:05,907
在我的朋友成为邻居前就在这
It was here before my company
built the neighborhood.

126
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,909
我不喜欢它的手臂
I don't like its arms.

127
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:12,080
- 它知道我住在这里,是吧?
- 它知道我们的一切
- It knows I live here, doesn't it?
- It knows everything about us.

128
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:15,249
那就是我在它旁边建房子的缘故,
它能保护我们
That's why I built the house next to it,
so it could protect us.

129
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,627
你,卡罗尔,达纳,你妈妈和我
You and Carol Anne
and Dana and your mom and me.

130
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,838
这是根老而智慧的树
It's a very wise old tree.

131
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:25,424
它看着我,它知道我在这
It looks at me.
It knows I live here.

132
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:30,596
我想,风暴会掠过我们而去
I think the storm's gonna pass us.

133
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,263
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

134
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,308
我能算出
'Cause I can count.

135
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,601
你知道怎么做?
You know what you do?

136
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,978
看到闪电时...
When you see the lightning...

137
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,398
就开始数,知道听到雷声
you count 'til you hear the thunder.

138
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:47,025
如果数的多说明风暴远了
If you can count higher each time,
that means the storm's movin' away.

139
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:50,612
想试试吗?
Wanna try it?

140
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,531
需要一些闪电啊
We need some lightning.

141
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:57,284
等等,来了
Wait. It's comin'.

142
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,542
好,开始数,1,2,3
Okay, count.
One, two, three.

143
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:13,465
跟你打赌,下次肯定可以数到4或者5
Next time, you'll be able to count
to at least four or five. Bet you.

144
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,300
爸,找你的
Daddy, it's for you.

145
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,593
让他们留个信,亲爱的
Tell them to take
a message, sweet pea.

146
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,469
我爸让你们留话
My dad wants to take a message.

147
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,725
晚安
Night.

148
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,021
太热了
It's too hot.

149
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,190
好,晚安,小天使
Okay. Night, angel.

150
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,276
- 做个好梦,好吗?
- 晚安,爸
- Happy dreams, okay?
- Night, Daddy.

151
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:42,155
1...
One...

152
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:43,740
2...
two...

153
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,450
3--
three--

154
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:56,459
我没有.少来了
I did not. Come on!

155
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:00,212
- 晚安,达尼
- 晚安.爸
- Good night, Dana.
- Good night, Dad.

156
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,217
- 别打电话了,达尼
- 好的,爸
- Get off the phone, Dana.
- Okay, Dad.

157
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:13,891
1...
One...

158
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,058
2--
two--

159
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,102
3...
Three...

160
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:18,186
4--
four--

161
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:19,353
5--
Five--

162
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,099
他们来了
They're here.

163
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:48,529
听我说,杰夫
不,我不开玩笑
Listen to me, Jeff.
No, I'm not kidding.

164
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:52,617
我知道,但谁在6.5级的风暴中还睡的着呢?
I know. How could anybody
sleep through a 6.5?

165
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,703
卧室受到损害,碎片到处都是
There was damage. Yeah, the bedroom.
There's stuff in pieces all over.

166
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,167
我们在听收音机,但是什么都没有
We're listening to the radio.
There's nothing on the radio at all.

167
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:10,882
你真讨厌,让我疯了
You are so obnoxious!
You drive me nuts!

168
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,884
力场
Force field.

169
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,887
- 你真讨厌
- 击中我的鼻子了
- You are so obnoxious.
- Got my nose.

170
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,932
这意味着战争,我也这么认为
This means war, and I mean it!

171
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,561
- 嘿,看着点
- 宝贝,你应该把食物咀嚼10次
- Hey, watch out.
- Honey, chew your food ten times.

172
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:28,730
你像个呕吐袋
You're a big barf bag.

173
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:30,940
你才像
You're a doggie bag.

174
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:34,777
- 我不吃了
- 你要吃的
- I won't eat it.
- There you go.

175
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:39,197
甜心,昨晚你说 ''他们来了''之时--
Sweetheart, last night
when you said, "They're here"--

176
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:41,491
我能把金鱼带到学校去吗?
Can I take my goldfish to school?

177
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:45,786
也许出问题的地方正好在房子下
但那些不用发出尖叫声吧?
Maybe the fault line runs directly under
our house. Wouldn't that be a scream?

178
00:25:45,786 --> 00:25:48,204
天花板一直在我床头响
The ceiling got crumbs
all over my bed.

179
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:52,166
记得你昨晚醒来说"他们来了"吗?
Remember last night when you woke up
and said, "They're here"?

180
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,411
你说谁呢,谁来了?
Who did you mean?
Who's here?

181
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,413
电视里的人
The TV people.

182
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,707
- 她醉了
- 你怎么知道?
- She's stoned.
- What do you know?

183
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,418
比你强! 问爸爸吧!
More than you! Ask Dad!

184
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,128
- ''问爸爸吧''
- ''问爸爸吧!''
- "Ask Dad!"
- "Ask Dad!"

185
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:09,005
''问爸爸吧!''
"Ask Dad!"

186
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:14,259
不是我的错
It's not my mess!

187
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:17,304
真是太感谢你,笨蛋,20分钟后我要去上学
Thanks a lot, jerko.
I've got class in 20 minutes.

188
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,890
自责之前把这交给我处理吧
Give me this
before you cut yourself.

189
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,142
地球是为你而运转的吗?
Did the earth move for you?

190
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:26,395
杰夫,这对我们来说不是同样的事情?
It wasn't quite the same
thing for us, Jeff. Huh?

191
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:29,856
好,对,就是的
Okay. Yeah, right. Okay.

192
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:35,319
- 我来处理这些
- 不是我的错
- Give me that before you cut yourself.
- It's not my fault.

193
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:37,738
再见,我走了
Bye, sweet pea.
I'm outta here.

194
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,156
- 再见,甜心
- 我也走了.
- Bye, honey.
- I'm outta here.

195
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,575
- 我可以送你
- 我去学校了
- You I can handle.
- I got school.

196
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:46,328
- 好,先吃早餐
- 好,那我就不及格了
- Well, breakfast first.
- All right. I'll just flunk.

197
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:13,726
每种工作都会有意外发生
It happens on every job.

198
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,728
看这个
Look at this!

199
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:20,191
我喜欢那小妞
I love that swing.

200
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,319
我爱你,我爱你
I love you. I love you.

201
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:30,073
我喜欢
I love it.

202
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,208
E. Buzz, 不不,
下来
E. Buzz, no, no!
Get down.

203
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:46,504
卡罗尔,我叫你们吃完后把椅子放进去的
Carol Anne, I've told you guys
to push your chairs in when you're done.

204
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:54,260
你会毁了你的眼睛的,这样不好
Honey, you're gonna ruin your eyes.
This is not good for you.

205
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,571
怎么了啊?
What's the matter?

206
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,282
你干什么?
What are you doing?

207
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:57,689
- 如何?
- 很棒, 富勒里女士.
- How is it?
- Great, Mrs. Freeling.

208
00:28:57,731 --> 00:29:01,025
- 好,布努托,把杯子给我
- 你的咖啡不错
- Okay, Bluto, give me my cup.
- You sure make good coffee.

209
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:21,334
天,别那样
Oh, Jesus!
Don't do that, honey.

210
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:25,462
你想把妈妈吓死吗?
You wanna see Mommy lying in a cigar box
covered with licorice?

211
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,297
是你做的?
Did you do this?

212
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:32,927
你们啊
You guys.

213
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:36,638
我叫你们别把椅子拉出来
I asked you
not to pull the chairs out.

214
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:01,951
电视人?
The TV people?

215
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:12,502
你看见他们了?
Do you see them?

216
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,677
有吗?
Do you?

217
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,817
我想你们肯定会很喜欢这个厨房的
I think you're really
gonna enjoy this kitchen.

218
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:44,695
最新装修过,我们管这叫第四代
This is our latest development.
We call this phase four.

219
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:46,697
你住哪?, 富勒里先生?
Where do you live, Mr. Freeling?

220
00:30:46,823 --> 00:30:50,993
我们是第一批住到佛得角山脉的人
We were the first family to set up house
in the Cuesta Verde Estates.

221
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,577
第一代
Oh, phase one.

222
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:55,413
我要穿过邻居的房子才能到这
We had to pass through
my neighborhood to get here.

223
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:58,374
那块有圣灵的地方
Oh, that area with
the lived-in look.

224
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:01,710
是有那么个说法,但是很快就不能分辨...
It has that, but in a couple of months
you won't be able to distinguish...

225
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:05,713
第一代,第二代和第三代了--
phase one from phase three to phase--

226
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:08,590
我们这有句谚语
We have a saying around here.

227
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:11,426
''草在每边都长的更绿.''
"The grass grows greener
on every side."

228
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:16,889
- 那就是我摸索出来的
- 我分不清这些房子
- That's the way I feel about it.
- I can't tell one house from the other.

229
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:19,016
我想你是对的
I think you're right.

230
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:22,895
但是我觉得我们的建筑标准还是很宽大的
But I think our construction standards
are really very liberal.

231
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,439
我有个邻居,他在自家的浴室里按了个
极可意牌浴缸...
I have this neighbor, and he built
his Jacuzzi in his bedroom...

232
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:30,025
它的出水管连在外面的浅水池
and it has a running aqueduct
connected to a wading pool outside.

233
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:32,694
一半在屋子里,一半在外面
It's built half in
and half out of his living room.

234
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:35,696
还上了昨日"城市与乡村"的封页
It was featured in last month's
issue of "Town and Country."

235
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:38,032
我带你去看看
I'll show you the den.

236
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,341
甜心,过来,快
Honey, come here, quick!

237
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:02,678
-快带你,在停止之前
- 但是这些罐子--
- Hurry, before it stops again!
- But the cans--

238
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:07,223
- 放松
- 好
- Easy.
- All right.

239
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:13,937
站这吧?
Just stand right here, okay?

240
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:18,483
我没让达纳和罗比知道,但是卡罗尔在这
所以她看见了
I've kept Dana and Robbie out of this,
but Carol Anne was here so she knows.

241
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:21,652
达纳不会保密,而罗比肯定要吓死
Dana would blab, and Robbie
would be up for three weeks.

242
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:24,655
我想你应该坐下
I think you should sit down.

243
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:28,366
就站着,行吗?
Now just stand, okay?

244
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:31,035
现在冷静下来
Now just be calm.

245
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:34,538
当你放开思维时想想我们的过去
Now reach back into our past
when you used to have an open mind.

246
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,372
记得吧?
Remember that?

247
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:40,334
下几分钟都要那么想
Just try to use that
for the next couple of minutes.

248
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,086
- 好吗?
- 好
- Okay?
- Okay.

249
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,504
妈妈没给做晚餐
Mother didn't cook any dinner.

250
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:47,341
我们去吃比萨吧?
We'll go to Pizza Hut, okay?

251
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,550
看着
Now just look.

252
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,094
只要看着
Just look. Just watch.

253
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,000
过来,宝贝
Come here, sweetheart.

254
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:33,879
你能把椅子移开...
Honey, could you move
the chair out of the way...

255
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,131
然后坐在那行吗?
and just stay down there?

256
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:38,300
- 让爸爸看看
- 我饿了
- Let's show Daddy.
- I'm hungry.

257
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,468
别跟妈妈争了
Now don't argue with Mommy.

258
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:42,845
我们再做一遍
Let's just do this once.

259
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,140
好,开始了
Okay, here we go.

260
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:48,892
我想要意大利香肠比萨
I want pepperoni pizza.

261
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,689
妈妈,热
Mommy, that burns.

262
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:58,859
地板还要打点腊,史迪夫,你来
The floor needs more wax.
Steven, you do it.

263
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:00,902
宝贝,试试
Honey, try.

264
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:04,197
好像有种回旋力...
It's like there's this tickling...

265
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,199
就在这,开始拉你
right in here,
and it starts to pull you.

266
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,035
然后就好像突然没有了空气...
It pulls you, and suddenly
it's like there's no air...

267
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:13,996
除非你能呼吸,
然后你开始感觉被拉下来--
except that you can breathe,
and you're getting pulled along--

268
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,207
- 嘿 本.
- 杜希尔先生, 嘿
- Hi, Ben.
- Mr. Tuthill, hi.

269
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,919
我的电视没开,所以如果你的遥控器有什么问题--
My TV's not on, so if you're
havin' problems with your set--

270
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:24,798
不是这个
戴安和我想知道--
It's nothing like that.
Diane and I were just wondering--

271
00:34:24,923 --> 00:34:28,384
-这听起来比较荒唐
-我也不相信
-This will sound strange coming from me.
-I doubt that.

272
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,888
蚊子太恐怖了
The mosquitoes are awful.

273
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,889
它们真该死
They're chowin' down.

274
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,183
它们从不来烦我
I've never been bothered by 'em.

275
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:41,395
我觉得自己没被咬过
I don't think I've ever
been bitten by one of 'em.

276
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:46,231
据我所知,我们家还没被咬过
As far as I know, nobody in my family's
ever been affected by 'em.

277
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:48,234
蚊子从没咬过你,是吧儿子?
Mosquito ever suck on you, son?

278
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:50,944
- 我不知道,爸爸
- 他不知道
- I don't know, Dad.
- He don't know.

279
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:57,241
看
Look.

280
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,706
抱歉
I'm sorry.

281
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,375
嗯, 杜希尔先生,看
Uh, Mr. Tuthill, look.

282
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,919
我们只是--
我们想知道的是--
We were just--
What we were wondering--

283
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:14,256
戴安,我的妻子,
和我想知道,本...
Diane, my wife,
and I were wondering, Ben...

284
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,633
隔壁有些有趣的事情发生
somethin' funny's
goin' on here next door.

285
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:19,552
有些--
Somethin', uh--

286
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:23,263
我们想知道你们最近有没有被什么东西骚扰
We were wondering if maybe you had
experienced any disturbances lately.

287
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:26,141
什么骚扰?
What kind of disturbances?

288
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,436
你知道...
Um, oh, you know, like...

289
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,147
像盘子啊家具啊自己移动
dishes or furniture
moving around by themselves.

290
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:40,769
别抓,会影响痊愈的
Don't scratch.
You're gonna infect 'em.

291
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:43,230
让我给你涂上
Just let me put this on.

292
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:46,316
- 别
- 我像个傻瓜
- Don't.
- Boy, did I feel like a fool.

293
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,069
抱歉,但是得涂上,我想有点失血
I'm sorry, but I had to say something.
We were losing blood.

294
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:52,738
- 这事儿还得出现在我们家
- 别抓
- We'll keep this thing in the family.
- Don't scratch.

295
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,781
明天我去叫几个人
Tomorrow I'll call somebody.

296
00:35:54,907 --> 00:35:58,326
比如,谁呢?
我已经看过黄页了
Who, for instance?
I already looked in the Yellow Pages.

297
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,620
给我们搬家具得人
真奇怪,也没有清单
Furniture movers we got.
Strange phenomena, there's no listing.

298
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,541
1,1千,2,2千...
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

299
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,377
3,3千,4,4千...
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand...

300
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:12,087
5,5千--
five, one thousand--

301
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,172
看
Honey, look.

302
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:18,218
我天天遇到这种变态的事情但是也没什么坏处
I lived with this freaky thing all day
and nothing bad happened.

303
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:23,222
这好像就是大自然的另一方面,
一个我们没资格了解的方面
It's like another side of nature, a side
that we're not qualified to understand.

304
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:27,558
当你过度反映,那么发生的就很重要
When you overreact, it makes
what happened much too important.

305
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,645
我知道发生了什么之前不准进厨房
No one's goin' in the kitchen
'til I know what's happening.

306
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:35,398
1,1千,2,2千...
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

307
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,692
3,3千,--
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand--

308
00:36:44,573 --> 00:36:47,700
1,1千,2,1千,3---
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three--

309
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,873
1,1千,2,2千.--
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand--

310
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:09,844
救命
Help me!

311
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:40,578
救命
Help me!

312
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:46,291
- 救我,爸爸
- 小心
- Help me, Dad!
- Be careful!

313
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,151
爸,快点
Dad, come on!

314
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:18,944
救命
Help me!

315
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:25,324
他来了
He's coming!

316
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:26,951
它要吃下我了
It's taking me in!

317
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,618
- 他来了
- 它弄伤我了
- He's coming!
- It's hurting me!

318
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:31,788
- 史迪夫,快点
- 爸爸,快救我
- Steven, hurry!
- Dad, help me!

319
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:33,915
- 坚持住
- 抓住他
- Hold on!
- Hold on to him!

320
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,851
抓住我,爸爸!
Hold me, Dad!

321
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:03,273
- 抓住了
- 我的腿
- I got him!
- My leg!

322
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:05,525
爸爸,我的腿
Dad, my leg!

323
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,235
救命啊,爸爸
Help me, Dad!

324
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:19,162
看,爸妈,是龙卷风
Look, Mom, Dad!
It's a tornado!

325
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:22,998
它刚才肯定是忽略了我们
不会有一幢房子幸免的--
It must've just skimmed us.
There wouldn't be a house left if--

326
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:27,418
我把她留在了楼上
I left her upstairs!

327
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:34,549
宝贝,我们来了
Baby, we're coming!

328
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:10,288
- 我去查厨房
- 不,我去
- I'll go check the kitchen.
- No! I'll do it!

329
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:12,289
你检查自己的卧室
You check your room.

330
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:31,472
宝贝?
Baby?

331
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,734
甜心?
Sweetheart?

332
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,156
宝贝?
Baby?

333
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:04,082
找到她了?
Did you find her?

334
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:06,793
我哪都找了,真是疯了
I've looked everywhere.
This is crazy.

335
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:11,213
噢,我的天
Oh, my-- My God.

336
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:14,926
泳池
The swimming pool.

337
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:24,225
小心,亲爱的
Be careful, honey!

338
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:41,240
妈咪
Mommy!

339
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:47,828
没事
Nothing!

340
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:56,544
谢天谢地
Thank God.

341
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:03,466
什么?
What?

342
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,804
噢,卡罗尔,谢天谢地
Oh, Carol Anne, thank God! Baby!

343
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:11,723
宝贝,你在哪?
Baby, where are you?

344
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:18,604
- 妈咪.过来
- 什么?
- Mommy, come over here!
- What is it?

345
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:20,688
什么,宝贝?
What, baby?

346
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:28,696
妈妈,我听不到
I can't hear you, Mommy.

347
00:42:28,738 --> 00:42:30,697
你在哪?
Where are you?

348
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,915
我听不到你,妈妈
I can't hear you, Mommy!

349
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,916
你在哪?
Where are you?

350
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:55,051
有哪些家庭成员被牵扯进去...
What members of the household
are involved...

351
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,178
他们都多大了?
and what are their ages?

352
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,764
有达尼,我的妻子,31岁
There's Diane, my wife.
She's 31.

353
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:03,517
啊,是32,对不起
Uh, 32. I'm sorry.

354
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:07,896
我最大的女儿,16岁
My oldest daughter, Dana.
She's 16.

355
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:10,898
我的儿子,罗伯特,8岁
My son, Robert, is eight.

356
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:16,319
5个
Five.

357
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:21,031
这件事公开过吗?
Has there been any publicity
about these events?

358
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:23,033
绝对没有
Absolutely nothing.

359
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:26,494
你敢确定...
Can you be reasonably sure...

360
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,205
没有理由让这些发生?
of not letting any get started?

361
00:43:29,247 --> 00:43:31,373
这就是我们最后希望的
That's the last thing we want.

362
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:34,209
我们还没去过警察局呢
We haven't even gone to the police.

363
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:38,337
你的家庭会欢迎...
Would your family welcome...

364
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,675
一个对此事的严密调查吗...
a serious investigation
of these disturbances...

365
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,219
这项调查可以让他们掌握第一手资料?
by someone who can make
firsthand observations?

366
00:43:46,345 --> 00:43:50,056
听着, 莱斯博士,
我们不在乎那些--
Look, Dr. Lesh,
we don't care about the disturbances--

367
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:54,143
打扰你们的的重击,...
the pounding and the flashing...

368
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:57,353
尖叫,音乐
the screaming, the music.

369
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,232
我们只要你们找到我的小女儿
We just want you
to find our little girl.

370
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,411
我想应该警告你们...
I guess I should warn you that...

371
00:44:16,537 --> 00:44:19,789
我们把这间屋子锁起来跟其他房间隔开
we keep the room locked off
from the rest of the house.

372
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,296
罗比跟我们睡, 达纳多跟朋友呆着一起
Robbie's sleeping with us now, and Dana
spends a lot of time with friends.

373
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:32,133
这种事情一共发生过多少回?
How many disturbances
have you recorded in the room?

374
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:34,843
我们不进那个屋子了
We don't go in the room anymore.

375
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:42,100
富勒里先生,我们会记录下任何物理的能量
变化和力场波动
Mr. Freeling, we'll record
any psychotropic energy or event.

376
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:46,103
是, 赖安曾在红土地上拍下了
一起事件十分有趣的环节
Yes, Ryan photographed an extraordinary
episode on a case in Redlands.

377
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:50,773
是的,是一个小孩子的玩具,
一个火柴盒大小的交通工具
That's right. It was a child's toy,
a very small Matchbox vehicle.

378
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:53,901
它滚了7英尺,穿过了一张油布毯
It rolled seven feet
across a linoleum surface.

379
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,487
这持续了7个小时
The duration of the event
was seven hours.

380
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,489
怎么会7个小时?
Seven hours for what?

381
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:01,157
让它花时间完成这段距离
For the vehicle
to complete the distance.

382
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,161
当然,一般的肉眼难以相信...
Of course, this would never
register on the naked eye...

383
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,704
但是我用高速照相机拍下了
but I have it recorded
on time-lapse camera.

384
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,916
太奇妙了
It's fantastic.

385
00:45:47,363 --> 00:45:51,074
我们一直努力维护这个家庭
We've been trying to
hold ourselves together as a family.

386
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,492
当然,大家现在睡的都很少
Of course,
no one's been sleeping much.

387
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,786
史迪夫也错过了那么多工作
Steven has missed so much work.

388
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:59,239
但是他确实很想知道这是什么原因
But he's been wonderful.
Really wonderful.

389
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:03,117
你调查闹鬼的房子有多久了?
How long have you been
investigating haunted houses?

390
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,869
- 富勒里女士--
- 戴安
- Mrs. Freeling--
- Diane.

391
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:11,166
下决定说你的屋子闹鬼还不是件很容易的事情
The determination as to whether
your home is haunted is not very easy.

392
00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:14,711
我的意思是...
What I meant to say was...

393
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:18,005
可能是个恶作剧...
it might very well be
a poltergeist intrusion...

394
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:20,841
而不是所谓的闹鬼
instead of a classic haunting.

395
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,552
有区别吗?
There's a difference?

396
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:26,595
看见了吗?
Did you see that?

397
00:46:26,638 --> 00:46:29,265
会有两次的,总是这样
There'll be two more.
They travel in pairs.

398
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,141
凯西博士.
Dr. Casey.

399
00:46:35,312 --> 00:46:37,021
应该行动快点.
Gotta be quicker than that.

400
00:46:38,314 --> 00:46:41,608
是电路原因,你可以闻到
It's electrical.
You can smell the charge.

401
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,443
是不是会闹恶作剧的鬼?
What about poltergeists?

402
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:48,781
闹恶作剧的鬼通常跟个人联系在一起的
Poltergeists are usually
associated with an individual.

403
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,742
闹鬼通常跟...
Haunting seem to be connected...

404
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:55,161
屋里一块区域有关
with an area,
a house, usually.

405
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:58,373
这种骚乱一般时间很短
Poltergeist disturbances
have a fairly short duration.

406
00:46:58,498 --> 00:47:00,624
大概2个月
Perhaps a couple of months.

407
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,626
而闹鬼则可能持续几年
Haunting can go on for years.

408
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:08,923
你是说这些事情可以很快就结束?
Are you telling me that all of this
could just suddenly end at any time?

409
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:11,341
是的
Yes, it could.

410
00:47:11,384 --> 00:47:13,510
除非这不是一般的闹鬼
Unless it's a haunting.

411
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:16,346
但是闹鬼一般不会跟活人扯上关系啊
But haunting don't usually
revolve around living people.

412
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:20,975
我们时间不多了,我女儿还活在这房子里
Then we don't have much time, because
my daughter is alive in this house.

413
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:24,477
她正在躲避莫名其妙的攻击
While trying to escape
from an unknown assailant.

414
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,231
马歇尔别确定病危得到严密的照顾
Marshall is listed as critical
and under intensive care.

415
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:31,650
这有点奇怪
This is probably
gonna seem a little strange.

416
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:40,366
这个频道听起来好些
We hear better on this channel.

417
00:47:40,408 --> 00:47:42,409
别问我原因
Don't ask me why.

418
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:45,537
嗯...
Well...

419
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,667
我想我对她说几句话
I guess I'll call her.

420
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,383
是妈妈,甜心
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

421
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:04,261
我们想和你谈话
We wanna talk to you.

422
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:14,144
请回答我,宝贝
Please answer me, baby.

423
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,147
请回答我
Please answer me.

424
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,150
小乖乖,跟我说话啊
Please talk to me, bunny.

425
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:27,947
看看这狗
Look at the dog.

426
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,704
你和我们在一起吗?
Are you with us now?

427
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,875
你能跟爸爸打声招呼吗?
Can you say hello to Daddy?

428
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:50,717
嘿,爸爸
Hello, Daddy.

429
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:56,722
嘿,小宝贝
Hello, sweet pea.

430
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:04,144
是妈妈,甜心
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

431
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:06,480
喂,妈妈
Hello, Mommy.

432
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:08,315
喂,宝贝
Hello, baby.

433
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:13,945
你能看见我吗?
Can you see me?

434
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:17,155
你能看见妈妈吗?
Can you see Mommy?

435
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,329
妈妈,你在哪?
Mommy, where are you?
Where are you?

436
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:27,665
我们在家,宝贝
We're home, baby.
We're home.

437
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,043
- 你能找到回家的路,回到我们身边吗?
- 妈妈,你在哪?
- Can you find a way home to us, baby?
- Mommy, where are you?

438
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,587
我找不到你
I can't find you!
I can't!

439
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,674
我害怕灯光,妈妈
I'm afraid of the light, Mommy!

440
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:40,884
我怕光
I'm afraid of the light!

441
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:42,510
叫她离光远点
Tell her to stay away
from the light!

442
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:46,639
- 也许这是出来的路
- 也许是,但不是给她的
- Maybe it's a way out.
- It is, but not for her.

443
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:50,267
快告诉她
Tell her quickly.

444
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:53,228
- 离光远点
- 告诉她,戴安
- Stay away from the light!
- Tell her, Diane.

445
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,104
离光远点
Stay away from the light!

446
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,648
光很危险,别靠近
The light is dangerous!
Don't go near it!

447
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:01,067
- 甚至别看一眼
- 我不信
- Don't even look at the light!
- I don't believe it.

448
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,820
声音有可能是通过民用波段传过来的
The voice could be coming
from a CB transmitter.

449
00:50:03,904 --> 00:50:05,822
这不是什么愚弄
This isn't a hoax!

450
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:23,670
那是什么?
What the hell is this?

451
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,505
是什么?
Anything?

452
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:29,592
- 什么都不敢确定
- 妈妈,这有人
- Nothing's registered.
- Mommy, there's somebody here.

453
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:37,390
是你吗?
Mommy, is that you?

454
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:40,267
不是妈妈
这是谁, 莱斯博士?
No, it's not Mommy.
Who is it, Dr. Lesh?

455
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:43,145
- 谁跟你在一起?
- 谁跟你在一起?
- Who's with you, baby?
- Who's with you?

456
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,105
有人来了,救我啊
Somebody's coming!
Help me, please!

457
00:50:47,107 --> 00:50:49,275
我的天,我的孩子
My God! My baby!

458
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:55,113
你个混蛋,她只是孩子啊
You bastards!
She's just a baby!

459
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:58,991
救她,难道你没听出发生了什么?
Help her!
Can't you hear what's happening?

460
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:01,118
听
Listen!

461
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,037
别碰我,离我远点
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

462
00:51:04,163 --> 00:51:07,582
妈妈,救我啊
Mommy, help me!

463
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:27,891
她刚才穿过我了
She just moved through me.

464
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,934
天
My God!

465
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:32,144
我感觉到她了
I felt her.

466
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:37,482
我可以嗅到她
I can smell her!

467
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:41,027
是她
It's her!

468
00:51:41,152 --> 00:51:43,862
闻我的衣服
她跟我同在
Smell my clothes.
She's all over me.

469
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,489
- 是她
- 我的天
- It's her.
- My God.

470
00:51:45,614 --> 00:51:48,241
是她,我感觉到了
It's her. I felt her.

471
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:51,744
就是
It is. It's her.

472
00:51:51,786 --> 00:51:53,203
就是
It is.

473
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:56,331
是我的孩子
It's my baby.

474
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:00,460
她穿过了我的灵魂
She went through my soul.

475
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:31,361
我再也听不到她了?
I can't hear her anymore.
Honey?

476
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:37,533
当她从视线中消失的时候...
Where exactly do you suppose
Carol Anne was playing...

477
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,368
她是在哪玩的?
when she vanished from sight?

478
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,206
卡罗尔消失的时候在哪玩?
Where was Carol Anne playing
when she disappeared?

479
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:49,710
最靠近她的卧室
Her bedroom closet.

480
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,544
我们去哪
Let's go up there.

481
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:53,713
他们不让你进
They won't let you in.

482
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,506
我们要去看看
We'll just see about that.

483
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:00,260
你怎么啦?
Whatever happened to you?

484
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:03,722
我不知道-我只是去检查孩子的房间
I was just about to check out
the kid's bedroom when-- I don't know.

485
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,723
有东西咬了我一口
Something took a bite outta me.

486
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,225
你被咬了?
You got bit?

487
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:11,686
-世界上最恐怖的肌肉痉挛
-我看看
-That or the world's worst muscle spasm.
-Let's have a look.

488
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:18,400
-想想我们还是在楼下睡觉
-不,错了
-Think we'll spend the night downstairs.
-No. Wrong.

489
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:22,738
甜心,你带着孩子俩去镇里过夜
Honey, you take Dana and Robbie
and go and spend tonight in town.

490
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:25,406
我不离开卡罗尔
I am not leaving here
without Carol Anne.

491
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:28,283
爸妈,这我再也呆不下了
Mom, Dad, I can't stay here anymore.

492
00:53:28,326 --> 00:53:30,702
好,宝贝,你们去
You go, baby, go.

493
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:33,747
我不会丢下这房子里的任何人的
I'm not gonna leave
anybody in this house alone.

494
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:52,763
能和你谈谈吗?
Can we talk to you?

495
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:54,430
走
Let's go.

496
00:53:57,892 --> 00:54:01,186
- 这些东西动了吗?
- 能测到一些点离子
- Any movement from those things?
- There's been some ionization flux.

497
00:54:01,312 --> 00:54:04,773
我想确定是不是因为潮湿导致结构的变化...
I'd like to make sure they're not caused
by humidity from structure leakage...

498
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:07,483
但我不去那查什么原因
but I'm not goin' up there
to find out.

499
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:10,778
这儿发生的事情已经超过正常范围了
We have got much more than the
paranormal episode taking place here.

500
00:54:10,903 --> 00:54:13,613
这房子里的科学力量...
There is a measurable
physical science in this house...

501
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:17,658
已经远远超过我遇到过的那些奇怪现象
that goes far beyond the creaking doors
or cold spots I've experienced.

502
00:54:17,784 --> 00:54:20,786
电视上的声音
它是从哪来的?
The voice on television.
Where is it coming from?

503
00:54:20,912 --> 00:54:24,873
没有接受任何电视信号...
The absence of a signal on a channel
that is not receiving a broadcast...

504
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:29,335
意味着它可以从很多东西那接受到声音.比如短波
means that it can receive a lot of noise
from many things, like short waves.

505
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:32,088
太阳黑子波动
汽车的电火花
Solar disturbances,
car ignition sparkings.

506
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:35,799
外太空,或是地下
Outer space.
Or inner space.

507
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:41,512
但是如果有块区域可以让人同时在两地出现?
What if these people have an area
of bilocation in their own living room?

508
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:42,971
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

509
00:54:43,055 --> 00:54:45,098
如果那就是出来的路...
If that is the way out...

510
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,561
那就是说这房子有进去的路
then maybe somewhere in this house
there's a way in.

511
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:01,195
别,开着吧
No, please.
Leave it on.

512
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,366
谢谢
Thanks.

513
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:11,120
你知道,当这么安静时...
You know,
when it's quiet like now...

514
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:14,706
我就知道从你们的角度该如何审视这些事情了
I can imagine how all of this
must look from your side.

515
00:55:14,832 --> 00:55:17,250
我真的很困惑
I'm really embarrassed.

516
00:55:17,376 --> 00:55:19,127
废话
Nonsense.

517
00:55:19,252 --> 00:55:22,671
我应该是那个跟你们来这受到困惑的人
I'm the one who should be embarrassed
being here with you nice people.

518
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:26,675
超心理学不是你该学习的东西
Parapsychology isn't something
you master in.

519
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:29,260
已经有两个毕业证书...
There are no
certificates of graduation...

520
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:32,555
但却没有工作执照
no licenses to practice.

521
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,390
我是个专业心理学家
I am a professional psychologist.

522
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:39,728
我毕生都献给了这些鬼鬼祟祟的事情
I spend most of my time
engaged in this ghostly hobby.

523
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:44,106
这让我成了这个年龄段最难让人接受的女人
Which makes me the most irresponsible
woman of my age that I know.

524
00:55:47,151 --> 00:55:49,861
你不用拿个杯子吗?
Would you like a glass for that?

525
00:55:49,903 --> 00:55:51,445
不,谢谢
No, thank you.

526
00:55:55,992 --> 00:55:58,410
你知道,你很搞笑
You know, you were very funny.

527
00:55:58,452 --> 00:56:00,995
你的手抖的很厉害
Your hands were shaking
about a mile a minute.

528
00:56:04,457 --> 00:56:06,458
还没结束
This isn't over.

529
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:08,919
我十分的恐惧
I'm absolutely terrified.

530
00:56:13,923 --> 00:56:17,050
尽是些我们无法理解的事情
It's all the things
that we don't understand.

531
00:56:19,762 --> 00:56:22,931
我感觉,那些猿人从原始森林走出来...
I feel like the protohuman,
coming out of the forest primeval...

532
00:56:23,056 --> 00:56:26,350
第一会看见了月亮,向它仍石子
and seeing the moon for the first time
and throwing rocks at it.

533
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:29,853
如果我被杀了,我能回来...
If I got killed,
would I come back...

534
00:56:29,895 --> 00:56:32,855
像我的女儿一样被陷在房子里吗?
and get stuck in the house
like my sister?

535
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:34,649
你妹妹没死
Your sister isn't dead, Robbie.

536
00:56:34,774 --> 00:56:36,650
如果我被杀了...
If I got killed...

537
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:39,861
我能去看望她,告诉如何出来吗?
could I visit her
and show her how to get back here?

538
00:56:39,904 --> 00:56:42,781
你可以系跟绳子在我身上,紧紧的拉住...
You could tie a rope around me
and hold it tight...

539
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:47,326
那么人们就可以拉住我们不让我们陷进去
then somebody could come and get us,
and we could live somewhere else.

540
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:51,871
有人相信...
Some people believe...

541
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:54,791
人死后灵魂会升入天堂
that when you die,
your soul goes to heaven.

542
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,917
外公死时...
When Grandpa was dead...

543
00:56:56,918 --> 00:57:00,629
我在医院的病床上看着他...
I looked at him in the hospital bed
and I was watching...

544
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:03,214
但是我没有见到有东西从他身上升起来
but I didn't see anything
go up out of him.

545
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,467
罗比,他的灵魂是看不见的
His soul is invisible, Robbie.
You couldn't see it.

546
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:09,469
但是外公为什么不和卡罗尔一起出现在电视上呢?
But how come Grandpa isn't
on television with Carol Anne?

547
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,557
有人相信人死后...
Some people believe
that when people die...

548
00:57:15,084 --> 00:57:17,545
有个非常棒的灯...
there's a wonderful light...

549
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:19,672
和太阳一样明亮...
as bright as the sun...

550
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:22,842
并且并不刺眼
but it doesn't hurt
to look into it.

551
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:26,513
你所想知道所有问题的所有答案...
All the answers to all the questions
that you ever want to know...

552
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:29,098
都在这灯里面
are inside that light.

553
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,269
而当你走向它，你就永远成了它的一部分
And when you walk to it,
you become a part of it forever.

554
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:37,106
然后，一些人死了...
And then, some people die...

555
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:39,692
但是他们自己并不知道
but they don't know
that they've gone.

556
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:43,446
他们以为他们自己还活着?
They think they're still alive?

557
00:57:46,324 --> 00:57:49,118
是的，可能他们并不想死
Maybe they didn't want to die.

558
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,412
可能他们还没有准备好
Maybe they weren't ready.

559
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:53,414
可能他们还没活够...
Maybe they hadn't
lived fully yet...

560
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:57,585
或者他们已经活了很长时间，
但是他们还想继续活下去
or they'd lived a long time,
but they still wanted more life.

561
00:57:57,585 --> 00:58:00,964
他们拒绝走向那个灯光...
They resist going into that light...

562
00:58:01,005 --> 00:58:04,342
无论那个灯多需要他们
however hard the light wants them.

563
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:07,428
他们留在了附近...
They just hang around...

564
00:58:07,428 --> 00:58:11,724
看电视，看着他们的朋友长大...
watch TV,
watch their friends grow up...

565
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:15,270
感到不开心和嫉妒
feeling unhappy and jealous.

566
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:18,189
那些感情很不好
Those feelings are bad.

567
00:58:18,273 --> 00:58:19,983
他们感到受伤害了
They hurt.

568
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:24,153
然后...
And then...

569
00:58:24,195 --> 00:58:26,489
那些人...
some people...

570
00:58:26,614 --> 00:58:30,326
失去了前往灯光的道路...
just get lost
on the way to the light...

571
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:34,163
他们需要有人来引导他们
and they need someone
to guide them to it.

572
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:36,749
所以那些人生气了...
So some people get angry...

573
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:39,502
并乱扔东西，像我的卧室一样?
and throw things around,
like in my bedroom?

574
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:44,507
就像在学校
Just like in school.

575
00:58:44,632 --> 00:58:47,218
一些小朋友对你很好...
Like, some kids are nice to you...

576
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:49,220
另一些对你刻薄
some kids are mean.

577
00:58:49,304 --> 00:58:51,973
我有一次被3个小孩打了
I got beat up once
by three kids.

578
00:58:52,056 --> 00:58:53,975
他们拿走了我的午饭钱
They took my lunch money.

579
00:58:54,058 --> 00:58:57,353
可能他们被卡车撞了，现在正在楼上呢
Maybe they got hit by a truck,
and they're upstairs right now.

580
00:58:57,478 --> 00:59:01,357
听着, 也许我们该睡觉了，好吗?
Listen, partner, maybe we oughta
get some shut-eye, okay?

581
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:04,068
你知道吗?
You know what?

582
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,237
当我们告诉奶奶今晚...
When we called Grandma tonight...

583
00:59:06,362 --> 00:59:09,240
她很兴奋你打算去陪她...
she got really excited that
you're comin' to stay with her...

584
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:13,286
她打算好好接待你们
and she's plannin' all these
neat things for you guys to do.

585
00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:15,663
我可以带E. Buzz和我一起去吗?
Can I take E. Buzz with me
when we go?

586
00:59:15,663 --> 00:59:17,999
当然可以
Sure you can.

587
00:59:18,082 --> 00:59:20,502
- 晚安，妈妈
- 晚安，亲爱的
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetie.

588
00:59:20,543 --> 00:59:22,212
晚安，女士
Night, lady.

589
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:25,715
晚安，爸爸
Night, Dad.

590
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,218
晚安, 罗比.
Night, Rob.

591
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:31,137
我爱你
I love you.

592
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:34,849
晚安, 卡罗尔.
Good night, Carol Anne.

593
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,743
我想去找点吃的
I'm gonna go
get something to eat.

594
01:06:01,986 --> 01:06:04,739
那是什么?
What is it?

595
01:06:21,756 --> 01:06:23,174
回放一下
Roll it back.

596
01:06:28,429 --> 01:06:30,723
我想我们应该已经录下来了
I think we got one.
I think it recorded.

597
01:06:37,146 --> 01:06:39,315
是的，录下来了
Yes. It recorded.

598
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:59,502
看看他们所有人
Look at all of them.

599
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:01,504
那是我们的房子吗?
Is that our house?

600
01:07:05,216 --> 01:07:07,177
那些人是谁?
Who are all those people?

601
01:07:08,178 --> 01:07:11,306
他们是这样孤独，这样孤独
They're so alone. So alone.

602
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:18,646
他们从哪里来?
Where are they coming from?

603
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:21,774
我不知道
I don't know.

604
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:57,393
打电话给我，好吗?
Call me, okay?

605
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,860
这块宝石已经有一百多年的历史了
This cameo is over
a hundred years old.

606
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:08,446
是的，挺长时间了?
Yeah, some haul, huh?

607
01:08:08,571 --> 01:08:11,991
而这块表只有几年的历史，而它不是你们的
And this watch is only
a few years old, and it's not yours.

608
01:08:13,868 --> 01:08:15,537
嗯，我先走了
Well, I'm off.

609
01:08:15,578 --> 01:08:18,540
我要带着这些东西和录像带去实验室
I'm taking these back to the lab
along with the tapes.

610
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,710
你知道，我不得不展示它们
I'm going to have to
display these, you know.

611
01:08:22,752 --> 01:08:25,755
- 请不要再“60分钟”上面
- 或是“难以置信”
- Please, not on "60 Minutes."
- Or "That's Incredible!"

612
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,758
对不起
I'll get it. Excuse me.

613
01:08:48,027 --> 01:08:50,321
我会把赖安留在这里陪你
I'm leaving Ryan here with you.

614
01:08:51,447 --> 01:08:53,491
马蒂不会回来了
Marty won't be coming back.

615
01:08:58,788 --> 01:09:01,040
我会回来的
I am coming back.

616
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:08,173
并且我会带回来一些有帮助的东西
And I'll bring some help.

617
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:10,175
不要担心
Try not to worry.

618
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:15,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

619
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,932
我们在办公室很想你
We've missed you
down at the office.

620
01:09:18,057 --> 01:09:22,770
小伙子们很担心，所以我过来看看--
The boys have gotten worried,
so I took it upon myself to--

621
01:09:22,812 --> 01:09:26,065
天啊，史迪夫, 你看上去很糟糕
你现在感到好点了吗?
Jesus, Steve, you look like shit.
Aren't you feeling any better?

622
01:09:26,107 --> 01:09:29,652
我还是感到很虚弱，逖格先生
我感冒了，我起不来--
I'm still weak, Mr. Teague.
I've got the flu, I can't get up--

623
01:09:29,694 --> 01:09:32,238
你这里看上去好像有线电视坏了
Looks like you got
some cable problems here.

624
01:09:32,363 --> 01:09:35,408
是的，有线坏了几个星期了
Yeah. The cable's been off
for a couple of weeks.

625
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:38,536
我们应该查一查。
这个街区的其他用户也坏了吗?
We'll have to look into that.
The rest of the block dark too?

626
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,956
不，只是我们
No, just us.

627
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:45,251
你这里电路好像也有点问题
You got some electrical problems
as well here.

628
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:48,922
你把什么东西装这里了，300瓦的灯泡?
What have you got screwed in there,
a 300-watt bulb?

629
01:09:48,963 --> 01:09:50,965
你怕遭贼，或是打算吸引...
You afraid of burglars,
or are you trying to attract...

630
01:09:50,965 --> 01:09:52,967
在佛得角山脉的所有昆虫?
every insect in Cuesta Verde?

631
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:57,514
- 史迪夫, 你在这里开心吗?
- 是的，先生
- Steve, are you happy here?
- Yes, I am, sir.

632
01:09:57,555 --> 01:09:59,682
恕我冒昧问这些问题...
Forgive me for asking
all these questions...

633
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:02,644
但我们不想失去我们最好的职员...
but we don't want to lose
the best rep we've ever had...

634
01:10:02,685 --> 01:10:05,855
因为感冒或是其他问题
to the flu
or other opportunities.

635
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,525
看了你起居室里的所有软件...
Seeing all that software
in your living room...

636
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:12,153
使我怀疑，也许你已经
得出点什么东西了
makes me wonder, maybe you've
got something going on the side.

637
01:10:12,153 --> 01:10:14,697
不，我只是在看 “普通机械学”
我有这嗜好
No, I just read "Popular Mechanics."
I got hobbies.

638
01:10:14,822 --> 01:10:16,824
想兜兜风吗?
Feel like going
for a little ride?

639
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:18,826
我有点东西想给你看
I'd like to show you something.

640
01:11:06,624 --> 01:11:11,045
哦，天啊! 对不起!
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

641
01:11:13,756 --> 01:11:16,759
你的一个孩子是在这屋子
里生下来的，对吗?
One of your children
was born in your house, huh?

642
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:24,100
我理解她错过了很多学校
I understand that she's
missed a lot of school.

643
01:11:24,225 --> 01:11:27,937
崔斯克的一个女儿也是在同一个护士班
One of Trask's daughters
is in the same nursery class.

644
01:11:28,062 --> 01:11:30,231
她也感冒了，是吗?
She got the flu as well, huh?

645
01:11:30,231 --> 01:11:32,233
是的，我们都感冒了
Yeah, we've all got
the same thing.

646
01:11:32,317 --> 01:11:33,484
对不起
I'm sorry.

647
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:37,947
- 我没看到她
- 她就在附近
- I didn't see her.
- She's around.

648
01:11:37,947 --> 01:11:41,784
我想，你不介意我问你个问题吧
I wonder if you'd mind
if I asked you a question.

649
01:11:41,826 --> 01:11:44,245
你是不是打算离开佛得角山脉?
Are you thinking about
leaving Cuesta Verde?

650
01:11:45,997 --> 01:11:49,209
为什么这世界上的所有人在这样
的一天都会有个问题？
How could anyone in the world
have a problem...

651
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:51,208
on a day like this?

652
01:11:53,421 --> 01:11:56,090
这个位置放个落地窗不错吧?
How's that spot
for a bay window?

653
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,095
你住在这里的话是不错，但是...
It's pretty nice if you're
living up here, but...

654
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:04,098
对于山谷里来说...
not so great
down in the valley...

655
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,267
看到山上有人家，就不怎么好看了
Looking at homes
cutting into the hillside.

656
01:12:06,392 --> 01:12:08,686
你不需要继续住在山谷里了
You don't have to live
in the valley anymore.

657
01:12:10,396 --> 01:12:11,981
你说什么?
What are you saying?

658
01:12:12,106 --> 01:12:14,692
我们将在我们现在站的地方开始5个阶段
We're starting phase five
right here where we're standing.

659
01:12:14,734 --> 01:12:17,695
这里可以成为你的主卧室套间
All of this can be
your master bedroom suite.

660
01:12:17,737 --> 01:12:20,406
那里可以成为你的观景台，
有兴趣吗?
That can be your view.
Interested?

661
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:25,161
嗯，逖格先生，你真大方阿
Well, Mr. Teague,
that's a generous offer.

662
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:30,041
- 我不是个开发商
- 你负责 42% 的销售
- I'm just not a developer.
- You're responsible for 42o/o of sales.

663
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,460
那几乎是下面所有的一半了
That's almost half
of everything down there.

664
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:36,005
几乎是价值7千万美元的房产
Almost $70 million worth
of dwelling and properties.

665
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,550
那是一整套安全的发展计划...
That's a whole generation
of security...

666
01:12:38,591 --> 01:12:40,844
没人可以往上面贴价格标签
that nobody
can put a price tag on.

667
01:12:40,885 --> 01:12:45,306
我认为我们应该3年前就使你
成为我们的完全合伙人
I know we should have made you
a full partner three years ago.

668
01:12:45,348 --> 01:12:47,308
我现在不想失去你
I don't want to lose you now.

669
01:12:53,356 --> 01:12:56,901
这里没有空间造个游泳池吧?
Not much room
for a pool, is there?

670
01:12:56,985 --> 01:12:59,195
我们有整块土地
We own all the land.

671
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:02,323
我们已经有了重新安排墓地的协议
We've already made arrangements
for relocating the cemetery.

672
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,493
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding me.

673
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:09,330
- 这会遭天遣的，不是吗?
- 哦，不要担心
- That's sacrilegious, isn't it?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

674
01:13:09,372 --> 01:13:13,042
毕竟，这不是古代部落的墓场
After all, it's not ancient
tribal burial ground.

675
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:15,378
这只是...人
It's just... people.

676
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:18,673
另外，我们以前也做过
Besides, we've done it before.

677
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:21,301
什么时候?
When?

678
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:24,304
76年，就在山谷里
In '76. Right down there.

679
01:13:30,059 --> 01:13:31,519
佛得角山脉?
Cuesta Verde?

680
01:13:31,603 --> 01:13:34,480
总共300亩土地，挺大的生意
All 300 acres.
It was quite a deal.

681
01:13:34,522 --> 01:13:36,608
我从没听说过
But I never heard
anything about it.

682
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:39,194
这又不值得在广告牌上登广告...
It's not something
one advertises on a billboard...

683
01:13:39,235 --> 01:13:41,237
或是登在汽车上
or on the side of a bus.

684
01:13:41,237 --> 01:13:46,496
不要担心，朋友和亲属可以
在布朗斯顿公墓看望故去的人
Don't worry. Friends and relatives
can visit their loved ones...
in Broxton Memorial Park.

685
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:48,536
只有5分钟的路程
It's only five minutes further.

686
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,372
哦，是的，5分钟路程，不太远
Oh, yeah. Five minutes.
That's no great hardship.

687
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:55,376
我想应该没问题
I suppose that would be okay.

688
01:13:56,669 --> 01:13:57,962
谁没问题?
Okay with whom?

689
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:01,382
可能会抱怨的人
Whomever might complain.

690
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:04,844
现在为止都没人抱怨
Nobody's complained until now.

691
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:28,827
我们在厨房有两种经历，这里是房间
We've had two experiences
in the kitchen. This is the den.

692
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:41,714
你们不要跟过来好吗?
Y'all mind hangin' back?

693
01:14:41,756 --> 01:14:43,716
你们会干扰我的频率
You're jammin' my frequencies.

694
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:36,936
那么... 我们今晚研究彩虹的
哪一边, 莱斯博士?
So... what side of the rainbow
are we working tonight, Dr. Lesh?

695
01:15:39,689 --> 01:15:43,067
- 这就是你的解决方案?
- 我知道你在想什么
- This your Knott's Berry Farm solution?
- I know what you're thinking.

696
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:47,363
但是你要记住我的话，她已经
驱清了很多屋子的鬼
But you must take my word for it.
She's cleaned many houses.

697
01:15:47,405 --> 01:15:49,365
她的能力有所记载--
Her gifts have been documented--

698
01:15:49,407 --> 01:15:51,701
那晚以后，我们没再听见过卡罗尔
We haven't heard Carol Anne
since last night.

699
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:53,953
这门为什么锁了，富勒里先生?
Why is this door locked,
Mr. Freeling?

700
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,668
- 回答她, 史迪夫.
- 我会的
- Answer her, Steven.
- I am.

701
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:05,673
我是说那个起居室
I am addressing the living.

702
01:16:06,382 --> 01:16:08,384
对不起
I'm sorry.

703
01:16:08,426 --> 01:16:10,845
那个房间是我的儿子和女儿住的
That's the room
my son and daughter used to occupy.

704
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,931
我们相信那是这个屋子的心脏
We believe it's the heart
of the house.

705
01:16:12,972 --> 01:16:15,391
这个屋子有很多心脏
This house has many hearts.

706
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:19,812
- 怎么啦?
- 怎么啦?
- What is the matter?
- What's the matter?

707
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,151
我试图用我的意念来回答她...
I was trying to answer her
with my mind...

708
01:16:25,235 --> 01:16:27,278
但她听不见我
and she couldn't hear me.

709
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,323
我记得你说过坦基纳 柏恩
具有透视能力
I thought you said this Tangina Barrons
was an extraordinary clairvoyant.

710
01:16:30,406 --> 01:16:31,741
我是有
I am.

711
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:36,704
我只是不喜欢欺骗性的答案
I just don't like trick answers.

712
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:46,881
过来，亲爱的...
Come here, honey...

713
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:49,884
把你的手给我
and give me your hand.

714
01:16:51,302 --> 01:16:53,263
我不会伤到你的
I'm not gonna bite you.

715
01:17:04,065 --> 01:17:08,027
低下来点，让我能够俯视你
Come on down here. You'll give me
a whiplash lookin' up at you.

716
01:17:13,616 --> 01:17:16,911
你女儿还活在这间屋子里
Your daughter is alive
and in this house.

717
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:32,302
最后一次事件发生在哪里?
Where was the last incident
of bilocation?

718
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:41,936
我强烈感觉到...
I get my strongest feelin'...

719
01:17:41,936 --> 01:17:46,357
源头起于孩子楼上的壁橱
the point of origin is in
the child's closet upstairs.

720
01:17:47,233 --> 01:17:50,486
是的，我也这样相信
Yes. I believe that too.

721
01:17:50,528 --> 01:17:55,492
亲爱的，你要为了我和为了你
的女儿而坚强点
Honey, you're gonna be strong for me
and for your daughter.

722
01:17:55,533 --> 01:18:01,388
没有了你的信心和对孩子的爱，
我什么都做不了...
I can do absolutely nothing
without your faith in this world...
and your love for the children.

723
01:18:01,414 --> 01:18:03,958
我会的，相信我，我会的
I will.
Believe me, I will.

724
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:10,981
那你会照我说的做吗？即使违背了
你作为一个人类和基督徒的信仰
And will you do anything I ask,
even if it comes contrary...
to your beliefs as a human being
and a Christian?

725
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:13,551
是的，我会的
Yes, I promise. Please!

726
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:22,560
你们都过来好吗?
Would you all come on in?

727
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:24,687
聚在一起
Gather 'round.

728
01:18:29,442 --> 01:18:31,402
这里没有死亡
There is no death.

729
01:18:32,695 --> 01:18:37,992
只是另一种不同的意识的转换
It is only a transition to
a different sphere of consciousness.

730
01:18:38,117 --> 01:18:42,330
卡罗尔和她身边的东西不同
Carol Anne is not like those
she's with.

731
01:18:43,706 --> 01:18:46,417
她是活生生地生存着的...
She is a living presence...

732
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:49,879
在他们的精神空间里
in their spiritual earthbound plane.

733
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:53,842
他们被她的一样东西所吸引...
They are attracted
to the one thing about her...

734
01:18:53,883 --> 01:18:59,013
对他们来说完全不同--
她的生命力
that is different from themselves--
her life force.

735
01:18:59,055 --> 01:19:01,641
非常强大
It is very strong.

736
01:19:01,724 --> 01:19:05,144
它散发出自己的光芒
It gives off
its own illumination.

737
01:19:05,186 --> 01:19:08,648
它意味着生命的光辉...
It is a light that implies life...

738
01:19:08,731 --> 01:19:11,192
爱和家庭的回忆...
and memory of love and home...

739
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,571
和现世的快乐--
and earthly pleasures--

740
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,616
这是他们绝对渴望的...
something they
desperately desire...

741
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:21,744
但却再也没有的
but can't have anymore.

742
01:19:23,329 --> 01:19:26,666
现在，她最靠近...
Right now, she's the closest thing
to that...

743
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:31,754
那个可怕的娱乐物...
and that is
a terrible distraction...

744
01:19:31,796 --> 01:19:35,884
有着来自他们的真实光线
from the real light
that has finally come for them.

745
01:19:37,093 --> 01:19:39,220
你听懂我说的吗?
Do you understand me?

746
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:47,979
这些灵魂，不知什么原因，没有停息...
These souls, who for
whatever reason are not at rest...

747
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:51,482
也没有意识到他们已经死了
are also not aware
that they have passed on.

748
01:19:52,692 --> 01:19:56,529
他们不是我们所知的意识
They're not part of consciousness
as we know it.

749
01:19:56,613 --> 01:19:59,908
他们永远徘徊于一种梦幻状态...
They linger in
a perpetual dream state...

750
01:20:00,992 --> 01:20:04,078
一个他们永远醒不来的噩梦中
a nightmare from which
they cannot awake.

751
01:20:05,246 --> 01:20:10,251
在七色光中是超度--
Inside the spectral light
is salvation--

752
01:20:11,503 --> 01:20:14,380
隔着窗口看来世
a window to the next plane.

753
01:20:14,422 --> 01:20:16,549
他们必须穿过这层隔膜...
They must pass through
this membrane...

754
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:20,929
那里有朋友等着引导他们去新的目的地
where friends are waiting
to guide them to new destinies.

755
01:20:22,555 --> 01:20:25,850
卡罗尔必须帮助他们去穿越...
Carol Anne must help them
cross over...

756
01:20:25,934 --> 01:20:30,813
而她只能听见她母亲的声音
and she will only hear
her mother's voice.

757
01:20:34,317 --> 01:20:35,443
现在...
Now...

758
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:38,821
要坚持住
hold on to yourselves.

759
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:44,994
还有件事
There's one more thing.

760
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:49,833
一个可怕的东西在那里和她在一起
A terrible presence
is in there with her.

761
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:55,171
非常粗暴，非常狂野
So much rage.
So much betrayal.

762
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:58,424
我以前从没感受过它这样的
I've never sensed
anything like it.

763
01:20:59,717 --> 01:21:02,846
我不知道什么东西盘旋在这个屋子里...
I don't know
what hovers over this house...

764
01:21:02,887 --> 01:21:06,641
但是它有足够的能力打个洞
来到这个世界...
but it was strong enough to punch
a hole into this world...

765
01:21:06,724 --> 01:21:08,726
并带走你们的女儿
and take your daughter
away from you.

766
01:21:10,645 --> 01:21:14,607
它使卡罗尔非常靠近它...
It keeps Carol Anne
very close to it...

767
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:17,026
远离七色光
and away from the spectral light.

768
01:21:17,902 --> 01:21:20,488
它对她说谎
It lies to her.

769
01:21:20,488 --> 01:21:24,742
它说些只有孩子听得懂的话
It says things
only a child can understand.

770
01:21:24,784 --> 01:21:28,288
它利用她来控制其它幽灵
It has been usin' her
to restrain the others.

771
01:21:30,206 --> 01:21:35,336
对她来说，它只是另一个孩子
To her, it simply is
another child.

772
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:41,509
对我们来说，它是个野兽
To us, it is the beast.

773
01:21:56,524 --> 01:21:58,610
现在，让我们来找回你女儿
Now let's go get your daughter.

774
01:22:03,364 --> 01:22:07,535
红缎带, 手帕, 网球
Red ribbons,
handkerchiefs, tennis balls.

775
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:09,537
好的，绳子准备好了
Okay, rope's ready.

776
01:22:09,621 --> 01:22:12,499
- 浴缸里的水呢?
- 我关了，也已经准备好了
- Bathwater?
- I shut it off. It's ready too.

777
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,543
好的，呼叫她吧
All right. Call to her.

778
01:22:25,428 --> 01:22:27,722
卡罗尔, 我是妈妈，
你听得见我吗？
Carol Anne, it's Mommy.
Can you hear me?

779
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:34,687
卡罗尔,
请对妈妈说hello
Carol Anne,
please tell Mommy hello.

780
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:38,733
再试试
Try again.

781
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:42,570
你能对爸爸说声Hello吗?
Can you say hello to Daddy?

782
01:22:43,821 --> 01:22:46,115
我和你爸爸都很想你
Daddy and I miss you so much.

783
01:22:47,325 --> 01:22:50,161
我们都非常想你，
So much. We love you so much.

784
01:22:50,286 --> 01:22:52,413
只要说声Hello
Please, just say hello.

785
01:22:52,455 --> 01:22:55,166
- 她被压抑住了
- 什么?
- She's under restraint.
- What?

786
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:58,127
- 谁在压抑她?
- 她被许多手臂围住了
- Who's restraining her?
- There are many arms about her.

787
01:22:58,169 --> 01:23:02,882
她认为很安全。你们谁更能威吓到她？
你还是你丈夫？
She thinks it's safe. Who is she more
threatened by, you or your husband?

788
01:23:02,966 --> 01:23:05,885
都不行。史迪夫判定对孩子们的惩罚--
Neither. Steve decides
the punishment the children--

789
01:23:05,969 --> 01:23:07,887
不公平，我从没打过他们--
That's not fair.
I've never laid a hand--

790
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:11,182
以后再吵，史迪夫,
让卡罗尔回答你们
Fight about it later.
Steven, make Carol Anne answer you.

791
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:16,437
对她生气
Be cross with her.

792
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:18,189
我是爸爸
It's Daddy.

793
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:20,900
对她发怒,否则你将再也见不到她
Be angry with her,
or you'll never see her again.

794
01:23:20,984 --> 01:23:23,570
卡罗尔, 我要你回答我
Carol Anne, I want you
to answer me.

你会打她屁股
Tell her if she doesn't answer you,
she'll get a spankin'.

- 亲爱的，不要这样，告诉她
- I've never spanked the children.
- Honey, please. Just tell her.

797
01:23:32,787 --> 01:23:35,331
卡罗尔,你快回答你的父母...
Carol Anne,
you answer your parents...

798
01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:37,917
否则我们都会狠狠地打你屁股
or you're gonna get
a real spanking from the both of us!

799
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:40,044
妈妈! 救我!
Mommy! Help me!

800
01:23:41,296 --> 01:23:45,216
- 她离开了他
- 离开了谁? 她还好吗?
- She's away from him.

801
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,218
达尼, 问问灯的事

妈妈，请救我!

803
01:23:54,225 --> 01:23:57,187

01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:01,983
告诉她，去灯那里
Tell her to go to the light.

806
01:24:03,693 --> 01:24:06,487
他们会跟着她，
他们已经跟着她几个星期了
They'll follow her. They've been
followin' her for weeks.

807
01:24:06,529 --> 01:24:09,532

妈妈，我找不到你!

跑向灯光那里!
用你最快的速度!
Run to the light!
Run as fast as you can!

810
01:24:15,663 --> 01:24:17,540
- 我就在灯光里!
- 不，亲爱的
- I am in the light!
- No, honey.

811
01:24:17,665 --> 01:24:19,709
- 告诉她，你在灯光里
- 不，这是谎言!
- Tell her you are.
- No, it's a lie!

812
01:24:19,834 --> 01:24:23,379
当你的孩子处于困境中，
你可以帮助她选择生或死
You can't choose between life and death
when dealin' with what is in between.

813
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:25,381
告诉她，否则会太晚了
Tell her before it's too late.

814
01:24:26,216 --> 01:24:28,676
孩子，跑向灯光那里

- 妈妈就在灯光里
- 告诉她，你在等她
- Mommy is in the light.
- Tell her you're waiting for her.

816
01:24:31,387 --> 01:24:34,641
妈妈正在灯光里等你。
我讨厌这样做
Mommy is waiting for you in the light.
I hate you for this.

817
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:39,145
现在什么都别想，它知道什么能使你害怕
Now clear your minds.
It knows what scares you.

818
01:24:39,229 --> 01:24:41,564
它从一开始就知道
It has from the very beginning.

819
01:24:41,648 --> 01:24:44,234
不要给它任何帮助。
它已经知道的够多了
Don't give it any help.
It knows too much already.

820
01:24:45,693 --> 01:24:47,737
现在，打开门

Tell her to stop!

Listen to me.
Do not go into the light.

831
01:27:12,465 --> 01:27:15,468
不管你在哪里，停下来。
转过身去
Stop where you are.
Turn away from it.

832
01:27:15,593 --> 01:27:17,345
甚至不要再看灯了
Don't even look at it.

833
01:27:17,428 --> 01:27:20,014
绳子快点!

834
01:27:23,726 --> 01:27:26,271
扔到灯光里去!
Throw it into the light!

835
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,197
太棒了
Fantastic.

836
01:27:37,323 --> 01:27:38,491

帮我把这围在我腰上!
Help me tie this around my waist!

841
01:28:16,654 --> 01:28:18,072
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

842
01:28:18,114 --> 01:28:21,242
我去把她带回来!
I'm goin' in after her!

843
01:28:21,367 --> 01:28:24,078
她不会跟你走的!
我去吧!
She won't come to you!
Let me go!

844
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,915
你以前从没做过!

不，让我去!
No! Let me!

848
01:28:34,005 --> 01:28:37,133
你不行！这里只有你足够
强壮能拉住绳子
You can't! Who's strong enough
to stay here and hold the rope?

849
01:29:03,701 --> 01:29:05,703

不要走开!
Don't let go!

01:29:55,336 --> 01:29:56,212
不会的!

01:30:06,347 --> 01:30:07,640

856
01:30:07,682 --> 01:30:10,059
我们怎么知道她找到了她?

857

我们什么时候能知道?

858
01:30:27,368 --> 01:30:29,954

你说过，“不要”!

灯里有和平和宁静

你说过不要走进灯里!

865
01:30:55,855 --> 01:30:57,982
史迪夫, 还没到时间!

866
01:31:16,167 --> 01:31:18,336
- 她们在这里!
- 她们回来了!

- They're back!

867
01:31:20,338 --> 01:31:22,632
达尼! 不要这样，不要!

把她们放进水里!

884
01:33:13,409 --> 01:33:14,869
当心
Be careful.

885
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,293
妈，我要去和贾尼斯和布赖恩一起吃饭
Mom, I'm going to dinner
with Janice and Brian.

886
01:33:22,335 --> 01:33:25,255
- 你房间都收拾好了吗?
- 所有的东西，除了床
- Is your room packed up?

887
01:33:25,296 --> 01:33:29,300

哦，你不喜欢?

895
01:33:49,445 --> 01:33:51,906
你不认为这有点庞克的味道?

亲爱的，我不知道

I feel a little hung over,
like I've been asleep for a few days...

903
01:34:16,097 --> 01:34:19,309
但... 我觉得很好, 史迪夫,
我真的感觉很好

闻上去像含羞草
Smell that mimosa.

907
01:34:35,116 --> 01:34:38,369
你最好割束花带着，我们不再住这里了
You better cut a bouquet and
take it with you. We're not stayin'.

908
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,538

我们为此而辛苦工作

如果孩子们睡着了，就让他们睡到我回来
If the kids get sleepy,
let 'em sleep 'til I get home.

916
01:35:01,267 --> 01:35:02,810
逖格怎么想?
How's Teague taking it?

917
01:35:02,852 --> 01:35:05,522
你知道逖格. 他不会把“去死吧”
当作一种答案
You know Teague. He won't take
"Go to hell" for an answer.

918
01:35:05,563 --> 01:35:07,690
- 你会告诉他什么?
- 我会给他方向
- What will you tell him?
- I'll give him directions.

directly from applicator to hair.

920

让我来玩

我想要回我的卡车!
