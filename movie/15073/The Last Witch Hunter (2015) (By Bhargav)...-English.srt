00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,592
I swear to you,

3
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:32,858
every single mother and daughter,

4
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:37,525
father and son taken from us

5
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:40,359
<i>by the Black Plague will be avenged.</i>

6
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:45,724
<i>It is their Witch Queen</i>

7
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,758
<i>who brought this
curse upon our lands.</i>

8
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:53,024
<i>And in her death lies our salvation.</i>

9
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,992
<i>Be warned, brothers.</i>

10
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:02,392
<i>She will never truly perish</i>

11
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:06,025
<i>until her heart beats its last.</i>

12
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,392
<i>Let fear be dead to us.</i>

13
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,892
<i>There is no going back,</i>

14
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,792
<i>for there is nothing to go back to.</i>

15
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:29,091
What is it, Dolan?

16
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:37,859
The Hexen are amongst us.

17
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,692
This place reeks of death.

18
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:45,092
Keep your wits about you.

19
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:47,059
Stay close.

20
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:52,824
It's her!

21
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,825
It's the Queen!

22
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,592
The magic.

23
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,025
Stay back!

24
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,492
By iron and fire!

25
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,591
Help us!

26
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,726
- Dolan!
- The Queen!

27
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:08,526
Heavenly Father,

28
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,091
protect us from these demons.

29
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,992
Ah!

30
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,026
Stay in formation, men!

31
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,492
Father!

32
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,460
Father!

33
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:53,092
Father, I missed you.

34
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,725
You're not real.

35
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,059
You can't be.

36
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:33,458
You breed like rats.

37
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:34,959
You put stone on top of stone

38
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:37,492
and then live in your own filth.

39
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:41,524
You are trespassers on our world.

40
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:45,425
This is why I created the Plague.

41
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:49,758
It's why every one of you must perish.

42
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,125
Ah!

43
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,424
By iron

44
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,791
and fire.

45
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,425
Everyone you love is gone.

46
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,925
I've seen it in your eyes.

47
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,759
You wish for death.

48
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,925
Today we both die.

49
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:13,159
I curse you with life.

50
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:17,659
To never know peace.

51
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:23,126
To walk the Earth alone for eternity.

52
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,624
You will never die.

53
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,625
Thank you.

54
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,125
Excuse me, miss?

55
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,491
Sir, how can I help you?

56
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,391
Magic.

57
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:24,925
Hey...

58
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:27,158
Watch it!

59
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,791
Sorry. Totally my fault.

60
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:33,992
Excuse me.

61
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:39,991
You're the witch hunter.

62
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,892
Yeah.

63
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,159
I didn't do anything.

64
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:44,658
Let's see it.

65
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:46,758
See what?

66
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:47,959
Come on.

67
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:52,958
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

68
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,491
<i>the Captain has turned on...</i>

69
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,959
Be glad you didn't get them wet.

70
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,892
I've been looking
for these for a while.

71
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:04,092
These are ancient runes.

72
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,792
They can manipulate weather.

73
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:08,658
Rain, wind, cold, heat...

74
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,758
And you just jammed them
together in your bag?

75
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,391
You know what you get
when you mix a thunderstorm

76
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,525
with cool, moist air at 40,000 feet?

77
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,725
It's simple science.

78
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,624
Unbelievable.

79
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:32,358
You witches have no idea
the power you've got.

80
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,758
Oh, my God.

81
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,792
Are you gonna turn
me over to the Witch Council?

82
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,458
No.

83
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,092
You're gonna kill me?

84
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,758
Kill you?

85
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,625
I'm tryin' to stop you
from killing yourself.

86
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,791
Enjoy New York.

87
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,391
Sir, "Fasten seatbelts" signs are on.

88
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:45,392
I need you to take a seat.

89
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,392
My name is Kaulder.

90
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,892
I need you to get back
to your seat, Kaulder.

91
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,592
I'd love to hear about
growing up in Sefrou.

92
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,824
How'd you know?

93
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,825
Haven't had an accent in years.

94
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,925
I've met a lot of people in my life.

95
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,359
You'd be amazed what you pick up.

96
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,724
<i>Witches
live among us in secret.</i>

97
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,924
<i>Their magic passed down
from an ancient race,</i>

98
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,925
<i>diluted, half-forgotten,
but dangerously powerful.</i>

99
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,625
<i>After centuries of conflict,
a truce was forged.</i>

100
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,392
<i>Witches would be allowed to live</i>

101
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,158
<i>and govern themselves
if they followed</i>

102
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:33,057
<i>one strict rule, that magic
never be used against humans.</i>

103
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:35,558
<i>But a truce is a fragile thing.</i>

104
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:36,625
<i>There are some who long for</i>

105
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,892
<i>the return of the old ways,</i>

106
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,625
<i>the dark days of the Witch Queen.</i>

107
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,024
<i>It is those whom Kaulder deals with.</i>

108
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:51,024
<i>For 800 years, he has
served The Axe and Cross.</i>

109
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:56,025
<i>Together we have kept
watch and kept the peace.</i>

110
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,024
Uh, I'm sorry, Father
Dolan. He's in a meeting.

111
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:10,992
Oh.

112
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,991
The meeting has concluded.

113
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:26,491
<i>I serve The Axe and Cross</i>

114
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:28,023
<i>in a very different manner.</i>

115
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,425
<i>I am the 36th Dolan, and
I write Kaulder's history.</i>

116
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,658
<i>I am his handler, his confessor,</i>

117
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,392
<i>and, I like to think, his friend.</i>

118
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:39,158
You have no sense of time.

119
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,624
Course I do. It's just
different than yours.

120
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:45,557
I assume
your mission was a success?

121
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,492
You recovered the weather
runes without incident?

122
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,825
What happened to the iPad I gave you?

123
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,925
I re-gifted it.

124
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,824
We're not all as adaptable as you.

125
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:56,524
You know paper's the past.

126
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:59,424
It's also a useful object
on which to record it.

127
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:04,625
Are you reminiscing
about the Ludwig affair?

128
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,358
I'm in a sentimental mood.

129
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:10,792
Ah.

130
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:12,824
About my retirement?

131
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,759
That's why you've come back.

132
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:16,858
We have had a good run.

133
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:19,424
We took out some nasty covens.

134
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,525
You're really ready to call it quits?

135
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,923
It's only been 50 years.

136
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:24,725
I'm finally getting used to you.

137
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,991
Oh. Is that all it took?

138
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,892
I'll miss you, kid.

139
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,425
This is a Waterman 402.

140
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,758
I had your initials engraved on it.

141
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,424
It's very rare.

142
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,058
Probably lowered the value quite a bit.

143
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:42,025
Not to me.

144
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,923
You reconsider, you can still keep the pen.

145
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:49,991
I think
you'll like my successor.

146
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,491
I'm leaving you in more modern hands.

147
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,458
What about the vow you took?

148
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:58,624
I vowed to face death at your side.

149
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:01,457
Not to work until I keel over.

150
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,024
Thirty-five Dolans have come before you.

151
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,392
Here's to the only one

152
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:08,724
whose advice I ever listened to.

153
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,991
Only to ignore it.

154
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,592
But I always listen.

155
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:16,391
What if you were retiring, too?

156
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,657
I mean, what would you do

157
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:21,457
if your next mission was your last?

158
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:22,557
But it won't be.

159
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:23,891
Humor me.

160
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,591
I have no complaints.

161
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,891
Every day I wake up,

162
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,525
the world sleeps a little easier.

163
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,891
Kaulder, you have tasted more of life

164
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,125
than I can ever imagine,

165
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,157
but it's been a long time
since you really lived.

166
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:40,591
You're missing out on the best part

167
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,024
of our brief stay in this world.

168
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,890
The part where you share it.

169
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,890
Find someone to trust.

170
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,657
I trust you.

171
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,692
Perhaps someone
a little more comely.

172
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:58,592
I know, I haven't lived

173
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,392
as long and rich a life as you,

174
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,058
but I do know that there is more to it

175
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,391
than a parade of stewardesses

176
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:08,024
marching to the dulcet tones
of <i>Moonlight Sonata.</i>

177
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,458
Now what in the world do you know

178
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,792
about stewardesses anyway?

179
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,457
I wasn't born a priest.

180
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,090
Let's do some work.

181
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,624
I know you think it's dull,

182
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:24,458
but let's start at the beginning.

183
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:49,023
It goes without saying,

184
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:51,790
but you've served with great distinction.

185
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,057
If I may, when I meet Kaulder tomorrow,

186
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:55,958
I should play it cool, right?

187
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:58,090
No coffee until after the ritual.

188
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,857
Don't worry about your style.

189
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:01,759
He'll take the piss out of you anyway.

190
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,726
But you'll be fine.

191
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:09,624
It's, uh, Kaulder that I worry about.

192
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:11,457
You worry about Kaulder?

193
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:12,924
Do you know how the elders

194
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,023
of The Axe and Cross refer to him?

195
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,392
They call him "The Weapon."

196
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,624
When I put in my reports,

197
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:19,091
all they want to know is numbers.

198
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,524
How many witches I've
turned over for detention.

199
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,591
How many slain for breaking the law.

200
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,458
Can you blame them? What
he does is so important.

201
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:30,823
Yes, that's true, but
he isn't just a weapon.

202
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:33,492
And those of us who know the truth,

203
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,791
we bear responsibility.

204
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:41,625
Whatever happens, promise
me you'll watch out for him.

205
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,023
Of course. That's my job.

206
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:55,359
Taxi!

207
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,690
Hello?

208
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,492
<i>Kaulder?</i>

209
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:43,557
<i>Dolan the 36th passed away
peacefully last night.</i>

210
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,625
<i>The ceremony will be tomorrow.</i>

211
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,624
<i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

212
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,958
Thirty-six have taken
the name "Dolan" before you.

213
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:57,890
Are you worthy of becoming the 37th?

214
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,957
I testify that I am.

215
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,524
Do you promise to serve

216
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,757
our brother Kaulder in all things?

217
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:08,591
To know him only as he knows himself?

218
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,757
I promise.

219
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,891
So you're the new guy.

220
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:47,924
We've actually met before.

221
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:51,492
A long time ago.

222
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,757
You see that cornerstone?

223
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,023
I watched them lay it in

224
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:02,458
when this was nothing
more than a cornfield.

225
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,358
That was a long time ago.

226
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:12,657
I pledge my life and loyalty
to you as the 37th Dolan.

227
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,791
I swear to help you carry
out your duty to the Order...

228
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,957
When they were building this city,

229
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,057
construction crews discovered

230
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:23,391
a mass gravesite, 60 feet below ground,

231
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:26,457
filled with thousands of forgotten slaves.

232
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,723
Know what they did?

233
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:30,490
No.

234
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:33,591
Worked by night, filled the hole,

235
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,357
and kept building.

236
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:39,425
There are shades of evil everywhere.

237
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,023
So,
I'm sorting you out with

238
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:49,591
fresh credit cards, new
passport, and a new identity.

239
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,791
Just gettin' used to the old one.

240
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:52,492
Well, it's out of date.

241
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:54,858
There are global databases now, CCTV's,

242
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,424
smartphones and geotracking.
The world is changing.

243
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,424
Only on the surface.

244
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,924
Right. But it's important
to keep a low profile.

245
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,023
Mmm-hmm.

246
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:04,590
Uh...

247
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:07,157
I guess we should be thankful it's not red.

248
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:09,124
May I ask where we're going?

249
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:12,757
I've seen people get old, retire, and die.

250
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,091
Rarely on the same day.

251
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,558
He was found at his desk.

252
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,857
What are we looking for?

253
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:40,425
How do you know when there's
magic in the vicinity?

254
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:42,723
A witch's magic comes from four elements,

255
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,457
fire, water, earth and air.

256
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,891
Applying the correct alchemical triggers

257
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,857
will reveal its presence.

258
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,758
No magic here.

259
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,891
Just wanted to be sure.

260
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:14,824
If the window hasn't been opened,

261
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:18,491
how did that get in here?

262
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,158
One means nothing.

263
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,891
Two, a coincidence.

264
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,359
Three, trouble.

265
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,857
Get down!

266
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:00,857
What?

267
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:04,457
He was killed by witches.

268
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:05,923
Never in the history of The Axe and Cross

269
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:07,924
has a Dolan ever been murdered.

270
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:10,624
You wanna quit?

271
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,758
No.

272
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,158
I want a raise.

273
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,491
This is a declaration of war.

274
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,991
Who could have done this?

275
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,790
A concealment spell was placed

276
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:21,557
to make everything look normal.

277
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:22,923
They were searching for something,

278
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,890
didn't want us to know.

279
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:29,491
Elemental magic is neutral.

280
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:34,058
At its root it's neither good nor evil.

281
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:39,125
But this is different.

282
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,423
This is dark magic.

283
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:43,657
Beyond evil.

284
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:49,890
They tied him to the chair.

285
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,724
"Death."

286
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,390
Is that part of the spell?

287
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:09,790
You were here last night
before he died, right?

288
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,757
Yes.

289
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:17,057
Let me see your hands.

290
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,623
Now.

291
00:24:28,957 --> 00:24:31,057
I was five years old

292
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:33,724
when witches set our house on fire.

293
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,424
My parents died.

294
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,491
But you walked through the flames,

295
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:37,824
wrapped me in a blanket,

296
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:40,124
and jumped out the second story window.

297
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:42,091
Your body broke the fall.

298
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,590
I told you we'd met before.

299
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:48,958
If you don't remember, I
can refer you to the entry...

300
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:52,791
No. I remember.

301
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:58,890
You hunted down the witches
and brought them to justice.

302
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:04,391
I've waited my entire life for
the opportunity to help you.

303
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,657
Well, now's your chance.

304
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,057
You can help me hunt the
witches that did this.

305
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:20,890
Shouldn't I have a gun or
an iron mallet or something?

306
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,691
Take a deep breath. Center yourself.

307
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,557
Right. Of course.

308
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,391
Because resisting enchantment
requires a clear mind.

309
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:30,424
Now, Max is a 14th level warlock,

310
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,758
there's nothing you can
do. May as well relax.

311
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:38,391
Free sample, Father?

312
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:40,823
Oh. Thank you.

313
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:42,790
I'd think twice about that.

314
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:50,623
I don't know that I can do $10,000.

315
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,957
You know the level of enchantment

316
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:53,590
they are getting from that.

317
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:54,824
Business is good, right?

318
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:56,723
Yeah.

319
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:57,891
Oh, crap.

320
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,924
Shop's closed, Max.

321
00:26:12,624 --> 00:26:15,157
Kaulder. It has been too long.

322
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:17,958
It is not illegal to
sell mind-altering bugs.

323
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,058
When they're used on humans, it is.

324
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:21,090
They're mixing them in the cupcakes.

325
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:23,157
I hadn't noticed.

326
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:25,124
Notice this?

327
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:30,691
Griffin's Henbane. Very rare and forbidden.

328
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:33,723
This is used in necromancy. Dark magic.

329
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:36,923
You know I do not deal in
these kinds of bad things.

330
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:40,890
Max, you're too smart to go down that road.

331
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:43,891
One can only imagine how
many times I've been lied to.

332
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,158
More than anyone in history, actually.

333
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:47,457
Come on, Kaulder.

334
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:49,890
You must understand, anyone
who would use this herb

335
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:52,923
is not afraid of you. And that scares me!

336
00:26:52,957 --> 00:26:56,390
More than I scare you?

337
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:58,490
Max.

338
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:03,990
The man who came to see
me has an odor on his skin.

339
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,057
A whiff of garlic that was not garlic.

340
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,623
Arsenic. Anything else?

341
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:13,125
And moldering crabapples.

342
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:16,858
Thank you, Max.

343
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:18,090
Be careful.

344
00:27:18,124 --> 00:27:19,125
Not in the habit.

345
00:27:19,158 --> 00:27:21,658
Not you. Him.

346
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:28,424
So, all that made sense to you?

347
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,424
It didn't to you?

348
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,124
No.

349
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:36,591
Arsenic was used for embalming
back in the Civil War.

350
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,791
Whoever killed Dolan

351
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,858
is likely living in what
was once a funeral parlor.

352
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:45,758
We just have to find one
with a crabapple tree.

353
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,391
What's that for?

354
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:52,723
A cab.

355
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:55,123
You're not qualified for what happens next.

356
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:56,624
Oh.

357
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:59,758
Right. I'll get a receipt.

358
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,691
Whoa.

359
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,990
Didn't your mother ever teach you

360
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:02,957
not to eat candy from trees?

361
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,557
Go home, kid.

362
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:02,691
Go away.

363
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:03,957
It's okay.

364
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,924
- Get away from me.
- Shh.

365
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:08,923
It's okay.

366
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,757
Get away from me now.

367
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:13,056
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Go away!

368
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,623
It's okay.

369
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,957
Ah...

370
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:29,090
Oh, shit.

371
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,624
You killed Dolan. Why?

372
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:43,656
Who the bloody hell's Dolan? Huh?

373
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,957
I never met the man in my life!

374
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,491
Do you like my new pen? Huh?

375
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:15,724
When I imagined my first prosecution

376
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:16,923
in front of the Council,

377
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:18,124
I never thought it would be

378
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:20,156
for a crime against one of our own.

379
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:22,591
Ellic Lemasniel.

380
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,757
Hello, Father. Whoo!

381
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,491
You look like a good man,

382
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:29,391
tasty little thing, you. I never went...

383
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:32,790
Please don't think less of me.

384
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,624
I'll confess it later.

385
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:01,624
The Witch Council receives you,

386
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:04,457
37th Dolan of The Axe and Cross.

387
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:06,890
The peace endures.

388
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:10,057
The peace endures.

389
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,157
I present the accused,

390
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:15,023
Ellic Lemasniel, for judgment,

391
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:18,156
for the murder of Dolan the 36th.

392
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,723
I present the evidence found
in the accused's dwelling.

393
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:23,889
Found? Oh, come on.

394
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:28,156
What? You look like a
terrible band from the '80s.

395
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:32,690
Look at your hair!

396
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,123
He will be judged.

397
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,889
Blah, blah, blah.

398
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,656
You know my great-grandfather's

399
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,423
grandfather served The Queen, huh?

400
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:41,922
The Queen.

401
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:43,591
You're a bureaucracy o' cowards

402
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,623
and I don't recognize the authority

403
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,124
here in this council.

404
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:48,523
Nor do I abide by your law.

405
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:52,857
The laws serve to
control and contain magic.

406
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:55,923
It is only by the
operations of this council

407
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,957
that another war does not begin.

408
00:32:57,991 --> 00:32:59,922
I won't lie! I'm proud of what I done!

409
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:02,157
I murdered your priest!

410
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:05,956
I drip-dried him like he was a stuck pig!

411
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,031
Our priest, and my friend.

412
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:09,490
Kaulder.

413
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:11,524
Oh, shit. This guy again.

414
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:15,523
So we're to judge him
without interrogation?

415
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:17,757
Has anyone asked him
who he was workin' with?

416
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,156
There's no Three of Pentacles card.

417
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,390
That means he worked alone.

418
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,557
The cards are wrong.

419
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,023
He cast a shape-shifting spell.

420
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,889
I haven't seen that crafted in 800 years.

421
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:36,989
Not since the time of the Witch Queen.

422
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:39,056
Ha! The Witch Queen is long dead.

423
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,724
That her magic could return is impossible.

424
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,089
- Is it impossible?
- It is.

425
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,758
- You have the authority...
- Enough!

426
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,022
...to
turn this city inside out.

427
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,123
For the crimes of illegal crafting...

428
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,123
Find who he's working with.

429
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,922
...and human sacrifice...

430
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:50,923
- And I'm proud o' what I done.
- ...we sentence...

431
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,022
...Ellic Lemasniel...

432
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:53,624
I'm proud o' what I done.

433
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,557
- ...to incarceration...
- I took a stand!

434
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:56,823
...in the bedrock
beneath this chamber.

435
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:58,591
You are sad reflections of...

436
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,157
Arise, Sentinel,

437
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:03,658
and carry the condemned to prison.

438
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,889
You'll never see daylight again.

439
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:25,423
No, no! You may hold me now,

440
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:28,357
but you'll never have us all!

441
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:42,823
What is that?

442
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:50,756
Hey, kid.

443
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,756
What are you doing?

444
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,423
Hello, Father.

445
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:15,956
Still with us, old friend.

446
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,457
He's alive?

447
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,456
Barely.

448
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,989
He's been cursed.

449
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,123
How?

450
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:24,491
Musca Mali.

451
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,790
Plague fly.

452
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,056
13th-century black magic.

453
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,822
They were created in the
tree of the Queen, correct?

454
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:32,056
That's right.

455
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,124
Why didn't they just murder him?

456
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:36,423
They wanted to interrogate him.

457
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:38,490
When a Plague fly burrows inside of you,

458
00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:40,457
it breaks your will.

459
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,156
Whatever the killers wanted to know,

460
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,990
he would have told them.

461
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,823
But the question remains,
what did they want to know?

462
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:54,557
He isn't getting up.

463
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:56,390
Not unless we could break the curse.

464
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:57,590
And the only way to do that

465
00:35:57,624 --> 00:35:59,123
is to kill the witch who cast it.

466
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,090
The one Ellic works for.

467
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,656
Dolan's got two days, tops.

468
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,890
Hang in there, for me.

469
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,989
"Death."

470
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:28,789
It's a message from Dolan, not the killer.

471
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,457
"Remember your death."

472
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,491
What does it mean?

473
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:43,523
There's only one way
to remember my death...

474
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:45,457
Magic.

475
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:51,491
Hey, Chloe.

476
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,391
I have one more drink here.

477
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,490
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're good.

478
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:01,090
Are we having a good night, gentlemen?

479
00:37:01,124 --> 00:37:02,890
Do a love shot with me, baby.

480
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:05,558
Oh, no. I'm not looking for love tonight.

481
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,757
- You guys okay?
- Yep.

482
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,724
- Want another one?
- All right.

483
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:36,655
Oh, no, come on! No, not you, too.

484
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,491
I heard that you can't tell
before it happens. Okay?

485
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:39,656
He's just standing there
all chilly calm, and then...

486
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,023
Wham! He cuts your head off

487
00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:42,689
and puts it in a sack on his belt.

488
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:43,690
C'mon! That's just a
story nannies tell children

489
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:44,957
so they behave.

490
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:48,490
Chloe, you need to leave.

491
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:51,589
Miranda. Miranda!

492
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:01,023
We're up to code. There are no humans here.

493
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:03,089
Beautiful place.

494
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:04,957
Thank you.

495
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,590
How much do you charge?

496
00:38:07,624 --> 00:38:09,123
Well, that depends on what you're buying.

497
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,890
A memory.

498
00:38:11,924 --> 00:38:13,924
Five hundred dollars.

499
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,723
Deal.

500
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:20,957
Did I just say "Hundred"? I...

501
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:23,856
No, you know what? I actually
meant "Five thousand."

502
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,124
Five thousand, is that what you meant?

503
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:26,989
I did. I meant "Five thousand."

504
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:28,957
Sold.

505
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:30,923
Fifty thousand.

506
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,623
Shall we start?

507
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:35,957
No. You know what? No.

508
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:38,823
I changed my mind. We're cl...

509
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:45,024
Fear potion.

510
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:50,090
Now, what in the world
would you be afraid of?

511
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:52,489
Public speaking.

512
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:53,622
You know what I'm afraid of?

513
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:55,124
Enlighten me.

514
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:57,923
Nothing. It's boring, really.

515
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:03,057
See now, I know that you have a code.

516
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,124
And I also know that I
haven't done anything wrong,

517
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:12,789
so unless you're gonna put
a gun to my head, get out.

518
00:39:12,823 --> 00:39:16,689
You know, you're right. I do have a code.

519
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:20,924
But I'm also not leaving.

520
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:25,523
What do you want a
memory potion for, anyway?

521
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:27,689
Are you hunting a witch?

522
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:29,957
To help an old friend.

523
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:45,590
But a word of warning to you.

524
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:46,690
If you get injured in your memory,

525
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:48,922
you get injured out here.

526
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:50,789
Which means to say that
if you die in there,

527
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:51,790
you will also die...

528
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,389
I can't die anywhere.

529
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:56,656
I have to make a
disclaimer for my insurance.

530
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:04,924
Bottoms up.

531
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:33,890
Say "Witch hunter."

532
00:40:33,924 --> 00:40:35,856
Witch hunter.

533
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:42,724
Be nice.

534
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:43,857
"Remember your death."

535
00:42:43,891 --> 00:42:46,956
What did you want me to see?

536
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,889
Kaulder!

537
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:52,057
Kaulder.

538
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:57,490
Kaulder, wake up.

539
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,623
Well, hello, witch hunter.

540
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:18,989
I was yanked out of a memory spell once.

541
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:21,455
My mind was scrambled eggs for hours.

542
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:27,656
You know, people shouldn't
root around in their past.

543
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,390
Some things are best left forgotten.

544
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:53,789
Ah...

545
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,390
You cursed my friend.

546
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,789
Your friend,

547
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:34,856
he lasted about five
minutes longer than most.

548
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:46,856
Doesn't take much balls
to get in a bar fight

549
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,823
when you can't get hurt.

550
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:55,856
Too bad your mind isn't as tough

551
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,823
as the rest of you.

552
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,523
No more bar.

553
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:03,090
No more memory potions for you.

554
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:52,824
Breathe.

555
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:54,956
Breathe.

556
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:19,656
After 800 years, you've run out of time.

557
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,522
Death is coming, witch hunter!

558
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:40,489
You are the monster they say you are.

559
00:46:41,724 --> 00:46:44,357
Damn you! This place was all I had!

560
00:49:10,756 --> 00:49:11,889
Chloe!

561
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:13,855
Grab my hand!

562
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:34,623
Nice view.

563
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,555
Just hold on, kid.

564
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:57,788
I promise I'll find who did
this and break the curse.

565
00:49:57,822 --> 00:49:59,456
Kaulder! Come see this!

566
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:02,023
I've got the FBI database online.

567
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:10,523
Stop, go back one.

568
00:50:10,557 --> 00:50:11,557
Continuing.

569
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,489
No, not him.

570
00:50:13,523 --> 00:50:14,622
Stop.

571
00:50:14,656 --> 00:50:16,956
That's him.

572
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,821
But why doesn't he want
me to remember my death?

573
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:22,389
Born Baltasar Ketola.

574
00:50:22,423 --> 00:50:23,989
Goes by Belial. Finnish national.

575
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:26,821
He's the one Ellic was working for.

576
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:29,921
The one who cursed Dolan?

577
00:50:29,955 --> 00:50:31,422
Every generation has to be given

578
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:33,623
their chance to destroy the world.

579
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:36,156
Yet most of us aren't like him, you know.

580
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,021
We're the same as you.

581
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:42,389
You may look like us, but you're not.

582
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:44,690
You've got magic in your blood.

583
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:47,022
Magic that can do very bad things.

584
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:48,689
We were interrupted back in your bar.

585
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:50,490
- Oh, yes.
- I have to try again.

586
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:52,755
Yes, my bar!

587
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:56,489
Where everything I cared
about burnt to the ground.

588
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:58,821
But I'm not blaming you for destroying

589
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,988
my life or anything.

590
00:51:01,022 --> 00:51:03,956
I'm just making an observation.

591
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:08,490
An observation on how
you destroyed my life.

592
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,056
I'm leaving.

593
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,689
Look, I don't like it any more than you do,

594
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:18,755
but if you help me, I
promise to keep you safe.

595
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,056
I'll need more Snowdonia hawkweed

596
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:27,156
to mix another memory potion.

597
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,622
Miranda, the girl who works for me,

598
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:29,856
has a pretty good stash.

599
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,922
Um, I'll text her.

600
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:32,889
Thank you.

601
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:37,423
Belial had red soil on his jacket.

602
00:51:37,457 --> 00:51:38,789
Red soil?

603
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:41,455
Analyze this and see what we get.

604
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:42,655
Of course.

605
00:51:46,922 --> 00:51:48,855
It's Miranda.

606
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:52,688
She's a cat person.

607
00:51:52,722 --> 00:51:55,021
Hey! Hey, there.

608
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:57,490
No, I'm not dead yet.

609
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:58,756
Right, so when she gets here,

610
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,423
don't make any sudden moves, okay?

611
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:03,622
Don't make eye contact.

612
00:52:03,656 --> 00:52:05,489
Or talk.

613
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,756
Whoa.

614
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:10,722
Sorry.

615
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,023
This is it here.

616
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,089
No, it hasn't sprouted yet.

617
00:52:30,123 --> 00:52:31,556
How many witch hunter

618
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,788
discussion groups are you a part of?

619
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:37,390
"Genocidal immortal fascist..."

620
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,055
So that's what you
witches think of me, huh?

621
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:45,089
What is it that people
know about us, anyway?

622
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,523
That we have green skin

623
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:48,589
and like to wear pointy hats,

624
00:52:48,622 --> 00:52:49,888
and that we're mean

625
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,755
and got burned at the stake in Salem?

626
00:52:55,822 --> 00:52:58,422
Salem was wrong,

627
00:52:58,456 --> 00:53:01,022
and those women innocent.

628
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:04,155
But what if those women
really were witches?

629
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:06,555
Would it then have been okay?

630
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:10,923
See, I remember thinking
if it was me found guilty,

631
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:14,622
no one would care.

632
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:16,589
I would.

633
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,389
The hawkweed's gone. It's gone.

634
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,557
I mean, someone's taken it. It's not here.

635
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:33,822
Kaulder?

636
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:37,022
What?

637
00:53:37,056 --> 00:53:39,921
- What?
- No.

638
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:41,856
Miranda.

639
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,422
Miranda!

640
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:54,489
<i>You're
too late, witch hunter.</i>

641
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:58,155
<i>She died badly, screaming.</i>

642
00:53:58,189 --> 00:54:00,654
<i>Alone.</i>

643
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:02,654
<i>Just like you will.</i>

644
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:17,156
You're gonna get who did this, right?

645
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,122
I'll handle Belial.

646
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,422
Good.

647
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:27,490
I don't know where else to
get the stuff that we need.

648
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:31,956
There is one place.

649
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:38,822
But it's old money, old
magic, and dangerous.

650
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,122
I'm sorry.

651
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:15,156
Kaulder?

652
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,123
Sonya.

653
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,522
Danique's been so busy,

654
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:25,088
I'm surprised that she agreed to see you.

655
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:26,089
I don't think she would have liked

656
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:27,589
the alternative.

657
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:47,621
Mr. Kaulder, you've made my night.

658
00:55:49,424 --> 00:55:51,390
Please have a seat.

659
00:55:52,956 --> 00:55:55,156
Where'd you rescue your little
friend from, a thrift shop?

660
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,190
- Little friend...
- Oh...

661
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:02,655
So tell me, what is this emergency?

662
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:04,089
What is it you just must remember?

663
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:07,390
He lost his car keys.

664
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,089
How much do I owe you?

665
00:56:09,123 --> 00:56:11,422
Oh, nothing. You have a drink
with me. That's my price.

666
00:56:11,456 --> 00:56:13,555
You know what I'm here for.

667
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:20,156
So many of us pretend to
be something that we're not.

668
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,521
But you, you've lived.

669
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:26,921
A man who's walked through history.

670
00:56:26,955 --> 00:56:30,522
To have known Napoleon, Stalin,

671
00:56:30,556 --> 00:56:32,455
Hitler...

672
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,389
No need to be nostalgic.
We have enough evil now.

673
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:39,589
They're not so different than you.

674
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:42,022
They used their power to change the world.

675
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:44,689
You can't change what you've done.

676
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,622
Kaulder! There's something
wrong with this plant.

677
00:56:58,423 --> 00:56:59,388
You're here.

678
00:56:59,422 --> 00:57:01,356
Kaulder...

679
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:05,654
Kaulder! Kaulder!

680
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,621
- Enjoy paradise.
- Kaulder!

681
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:09,588
Kaulder, it's smoke. Don't...

682
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:18,422
Look, Daddy. Look!

683
00:57:18,456 --> 00:57:20,388
They're flying south for the winter.

684
00:57:26,157 --> 00:57:29,389
<i>Kaulder, listen to me.</i>

685
00:57:29,423 --> 00:57:32,655
<i>You are in a trap and
I need you to wake up.</i>

686
00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:44,888
You're not gonna find any answers here.

687
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:47,622
The longer you wait, the
harder it is to get out.

688
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:58,655
Kaulder. Kaulder.

689
00:57:58,689 --> 00:58:01,688
I need you to wake up.
None of this is real.

690
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:03,755
Kaulder, you are in a trap!

691
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:10,989
Come back.

692
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,455
Kaulder, if you
don't wake up right now,

693
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:18,122
we are both going to die!

694
00:58:18,156 --> 00:58:20,156
Wake up!

695
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:22,123
Chloe...

696
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:31,856
This isn't real.

697
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,589
<i>Kaulder! Wake up!</i>

698
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:38,488
Pull the car into the alley

699
00:58:38,522 --> 00:58:39,955
and throw him in the trunk.

700
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,822
We're going down in history

701
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:43,856
as the ones who beat the witch hunter.

702
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,589
Come on.

703
00:58:50,623 --> 00:58:52,555
Get out.

704
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:03,389
Burial dirt.

705
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:06,356
Nothing more powerful for dark magic.

706
00:59:10,122 --> 00:59:12,454
What does Belial want with it?

707
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:14,488
Who?

708
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:18,089
"Remember my death."

709
00:59:18,123 --> 00:59:21,356
What is it that he doesn't want me to see?

710
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,988
Stop! Please.

711
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:30,654
Belial didn't tell me anything.

712
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:32,822
I helped him get the dirt.

713
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:34,956
I just took a little bit for myself.

714
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,922
He has tons of it.

715
00:59:37,956 --> 00:59:39,889
Please?

716
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:49,022
Thanks for the drink.

717
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,388
You are a traitor to your kind!

718
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:58,455
You know what I like about thrift shops?

719
00:59:59,789 --> 01:00:01,923
Everything in them is old.

720
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:07,722
Oh!

721
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:28,022
Bitch.

722
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:39,356
So now you know.

723
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:46,454
You're a dream-walker.

724
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:49,455
Everyone knows that
dream-walking is a black gift.

725
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:56,488
I've spent my entire life
trying to hide from it.

726
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:59,722
You knew I would discover your
secret, and you didn't care.

727
01:01:01,722 --> 01:01:04,022
You still pulled me out of that trap.

728
01:01:05,056 --> 01:01:08,055
It was a very brave thing to do.

729
01:01:08,089 --> 01:01:11,022
Lemme show you something. Come on.

730
01:01:12,122 --> 01:01:14,355
Good night, Max!

731
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:44,121
You are a disgrace to our kind.

732
01:01:44,155 --> 01:01:46,554
Belial, I had no choice.

733
01:01:46,588 --> 01:01:48,722
Kaulder threatened to beat me
to death with his bare hands.

734
01:01:48,756 --> 01:01:50,856
We have plans for you, traitor.

735
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:53,810
You must understand, Belial.

736
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:58,622
Enjoy the shadows.

737
01:02:20,588 --> 01:02:25,121
This is the history of
witches. Your history.

738
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:28,121
That's you.

739
01:02:28,155 --> 01:02:29,589
Yeah.

740
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:31,989
Least they got your eyes right.

741
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:36,622
These are the dream-walkers.

742
01:02:36,656 --> 01:02:39,122
The Witch Queen's deadliest assassins.

743
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,955
Somehow they used to jump into your mind

744
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:43,589
and pry out your most precious memories.

745
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:47,756
And then they'd twist 'em
into your worst nightmares.

746
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,020
What, you're giving a history lesson here

747
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:50,856
or you're just trying to scare me?

748
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:53,522
There's something no one
knows about dream-walkers.

749
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,789
They don't need memory potions.

750
01:02:57,823 --> 01:03:00,989
That power lies within them.

751
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:03,555
I have something buried deep in my mind

752
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:05,656
that I must remember.

753
01:03:07,556 --> 01:03:10,622
And you're the only one that can help me.

754
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:11,889
No, I can't.

755
01:03:11,923 --> 01:03:13,588
Chloe...

756
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,555
No, I can't.

757
01:03:17,989 --> 01:03:19,856
You know, I have a younger brother,

758
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,155
and, uh,

759
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:26,921
he had this knack for just pissing me off.

760
01:03:26,955 --> 01:03:29,087
And one day he pushed it too far,

761
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:32,388
and I somehow entered his mind.

762
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:34,955
I hurt him. I didn't mean to,

763
01:03:34,988 --> 01:03:38,422
but I hurt him badly.

764
01:03:38,456 --> 01:03:40,689
So I ran away.

765
01:03:59,556 --> 01:04:03,988
What were their names,
your wife and daughter?

766
01:04:04,022 --> 01:04:05,955
Helena.

767
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:09,021
Elizabeth.

768
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:15,555
I haven't said their names
out loud in a long time.

769
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:22,856
Kaulder, even if I wanted to help you,

770
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,823
I wouldn't know where to begin.

771
01:04:27,755 --> 01:04:31,722
Think of a word that you associate with me.

772
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:34,388
Could be anything.

773
01:04:34,422 --> 01:04:37,622
Empty everything else out of your head.

774
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:43,020
And just focus on that one word.

775
01:04:43,054 --> 01:04:44,987
One word.

776
01:04:46,756 --> 01:04:49,554
If you tell me the word,
I'll focus on it, too.

777
01:04:49,588 --> 01:04:51,588
Sometimes that helps.

778
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:53,689
What's the word?

779
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:57,422
Alone.

780
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,822
Take my hand.

781
01:06:05,188 --> 01:06:07,988
This way, men!

782
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:10,121
Brother Dolan, look.

783
01:06:15,822 --> 01:06:17,554
Kaulder.

784
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:23,121
What is that? Dolan?

785
01:06:23,155 --> 01:06:25,621
Tread with care.

786
01:06:25,655 --> 01:06:27,789
He did it.

787
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:32,854
So ends the Queen.

788
01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:38,155
In the name of the Father...

789
01:06:38,189 --> 01:06:39,954
He's possessed!

790
01:06:39,988 --> 01:06:42,021
Kaulder is alive.

791
01:06:42,055 --> 01:06:43,955
Our nightmare ends with a miracle.

792
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:46,555
Help him.

793
01:06:46,589 --> 01:06:48,087
Help him.

794
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:53,087
It's her heart.

795
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:56,155
When we destroy it, we destroy her.

796
01:06:56,189 --> 01:06:58,122
End it, Brother Dolan.

797
01:07:18,889 --> 01:07:20,888
Destroy her, Dolan!

798
01:07:23,523 --> 01:07:25,455
No!

799
01:07:31,556 --> 01:07:33,556
You kept it.

800
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:38,621
It's over. The Witch Queen is dead.

801
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:46,054
They betrayed you from the start.

802
01:07:46,088 --> 01:07:49,421
That's why they tortured your friend.

803
01:07:49,455 --> 01:07:51,887
Because he knew where the heart was.

804
01:07:51,921 --> 01:07:53,854
They're gonna bring back the Queen.

805
01:08:01,821 --> 01:08:03,554
For eight hundred years,

806
01:08:03,588 --> 01:08:05,320
we've waited for her return.

807
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:09,021
You should be honored, traitor.

808
01:08:09,055 --> 01:08:12,122
You will be sacrificed for our cause.

809
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:17,887
Kaulder, I know where
Belial brought all that dirt.

810
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:20,154
The truck he rented had
a standard GPS locator...

811
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:21,721
You lied to me!

812
01:08:21,755 --> 01:08:25,920
You saved her heart. "Remember your death."

813
01:08:25,954 --> 01:08:27,921
It's not what you think.

814
01:08:30,155 --> 01:08:32,622
You knew what it meant all
along, and you said nothing.

815
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:34,788
Because I wasn't going to be responsible

816
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:37,455
for the dissolution of The Axe
and Cross on my very first...

817
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,588
They're bringing back the Queen.

818
01:08:42,054 --> 01:08:44,088
You don't know what you've done.

819
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:48,556
I swore an oath to keep it secret.

820
01:08:49,722 --> 01:08:54,020
This lie has kept Apocalypse
at bay for hundreds of years.

821
01:08:54,054 --> 01:08:56,522
We were afraid if the
Queen's heart was destroyed,

822
01:08:56,556 --> 01:08:58,622
you'd lose your immortality. Or die.

823
01:08:58,655 --> 01:09:00,855
That wasn't your choice to make!

824
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:06,389
That's what the old man thought.

825
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:11,454
The night he was attacked,

826
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:13,588
I think he was going to destroy it.

827
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,556
For you.

828
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:24,122
To set you free.

829
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:37,088
At least The Axe and Cross
still has their weapon.

830
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:45,088
You will serve the Queen...

831
01:09:45,122 --> 01:09:47,122
No, please.

832
01:09:47,156 --> 01:09:49,954
...like it or not.

833
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:04,621
Ah!

834
01:10:16,788 --> 01:10:19,621
Go to my apartment. You'll be safe there.

835
01:10:19,655 --> 01:10:22,454
No, the deal was that we stick together.

836
01:10:22,488 --> 01:10:24,087
I'm going alone. If I can't trust

837
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:26,587
my own people, how the
hell can I trust you?

838
01:10:29,156 --> 01:10:32,454
This isn't who you are.

839
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:34,654
It's all I am.

840
01:11:04,888 --> 01:11:06,887
Pierce her with iron.

841
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:10,155
Scour her by fire.

842
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:12,854
Bring her endless death.

843
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:43,654
I've missed you, Kaulder.

844
01:11:43,688 --> 01:11:46,487
Here's what you don't understand.

845
01:11:46,521 --> 01:11:49,455
What your kind never understood.

846
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:52,021
I've shown mercy.

847
01:11:52,055 --> 01:11:55,455
I could have killed every last one of you.

848
01:11:55,488 --> 01:11:58,020
I've done the math.

849
01:11:58,054 --> 01:12:00,054
I've had the time.

850
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:03,888
You're different now. So confident.

851
01:12:03,922 --> 01:12:06,356
Maybe you shouldn't have made me immortal.

852
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:10,854
Kaulder, I came to help.

853
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:14,054
Chloe. I told you not to...

854
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:49,787
Immortality was never yours. It was mine.

855
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:53,101
You just carried it for me.

856
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:57,221
Until now.

857
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:03,722
I am reborn.

858
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:13,988
Ah!

859
01:13:34,587 --> 01:13:37,553
Your race

860
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:40,988
has always been frightened.

861
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:46,987
Hiding in caves.

862
01:13:47,021 --> 01:13:49,521
Huddling around fire.

863
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:52,721
Finally.

864
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:01,055
Hey, kid. I was afraid I was too late.

865
01:15:01,089 --> 01:15:03,988
I hope I don't look as rough as you do.

866
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:07,687
Okay.

867
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:12,654
I killed the one who cursed you.

868
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:15,121
Here.

869
01:15:15,155 --> 01:15:17,089
Drink this.

870
01:15:22,621 --> 01:15:24,555
Thank you.

871
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:29,555
The Witch Queen has returned.

872
01:15:30,854 --> 01:15:32,653
I thought my immortality

873
01:15:32,687 --> 01:15:35,155
was the way that she punished me.

874
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:38,987
But she just used me
to save it for herself.

875
01:15:39,021 --> 01:15:42,020
I'm afraid I bear some responsibility.

876
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:44,088
It was hubris to think

877
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:47,588
that our secret wouldn't
be discovered by the enemy.

878
01:15:47,622 --> 01:15:50,588
I've seen what comes next.

879
01:15:50,622 --> 01:15:52,688
Death.

880
01:15:54,188 --> 01:15:58,087
The Witch Queen will
cast another plague curse.

881
01:15:58,121 --> 01:16:02,055
Haven't covens with that
kind of power been destroyed?

882
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:04,154
We don't destroy witches anymore.

883
01:16:04,188 --> 01:16:06,888
We incarcerate them.

884
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:11,621
We took all the most powerful witches

885
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:12,696
that ever walked the Earth

886
01:16:12,722 --> 01:16:14,887
and put 'em in one place.

887
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:17,154
The witch prison.

888
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:21,653
And they've been waiting,
waiting to be released.

889
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:24,022
Waiting to exact revenge.

890
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:29,122
We created the perfect coven.

891
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:35,021
Now I'm right back where I started.

892
01:16:36,988 --> 01:16:40,020
You defeated her once.

893
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,954
You can defeat her again.

894
01:16:42,988 --> 01:16:44,922
Kaulder,

895
01:16:46,122 --> 01:16:48,055
you must go.

896
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:51,787
You have to fight.

897
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:10,555
Kaulder.

898
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:18,022
I never had a name for it.

899
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:22,754
But my enemies came to call it "Hexenbane."

900
01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:26,553
Witch Slayer.

901
01:17:26,587 --> 01:17:28,388
I'm coming, too.

902
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:30,988
Our agreement depended
on me keeping you safe.

903
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:32,821
No, our agreement was that if I helped you,

904
01:17:32,855 --> 01:17:34,754
you'd keep me safe.

905
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:37,020
If I get hurt now, I stay hurt.

906
01:17:37,054 --> 01:17:39,988
Where would that leave you?

907
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:42,521
You know, I don't care!

908
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:44,755
Who says that a witch can't hunt witches?

909
01:18:01,755 --> 01:18:03,688
Chloe.

910
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:06,955
Kaulder.

911
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,554
What is this?

912
01:18:22,588 --> 01:18:24,620
It's a plague tree. She's here.

913
01:18:24,654 --> 01:18:26,055
When the spell is done,

914
01:18:26,088 --> 01:18:28,721
the fly swarm will be released.

915
01:18:28,755 --> 01:18:30,922
We haven't much time.

916
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:43,688
Stay close.

917
01:18:50,954 --> 01:18:53,588
Kaulder, where are the prisoners?

918
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:03,555
My God!

919
01:19:06,022 --> 01:19:08,154
Every witch I ever caught.

920
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:10,755
The Queen's using their
power to release the plague.

921
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:12,388
How?

922
01:19:12,422 --> 01:19:14,121
The chant.

923
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:15,554
No witch would be strong enough

924
01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:16,821
to cast this spell alone.

925
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:18,453
But the Witch Queen's

926
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,121
linking their minds like a chain.

927
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,088
So how do we stop them?

928
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:25,754
Every chain has a weak link.

929
01:19:58,822 --> 01:20:00,854
- I'll do the honors.
- No.

930
01:20:00,888 --> 01:20:02,754
It's not his body we need to destroy.

931
01:20:02,788 --> 01:20:04,821
It's his mind.

932
01:20:06,654 --> 01:20:08,054
But if he dies in his dreams,

933
01:20:08,088 --> 01:20:09,986
the plague will be stopped.

934
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,088
I wish there was another way.

935
01:20:15,622 --> 01:20:17,888
You'll still be here
when I get back, right?

936
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:23,687
You're taking on the
Queen alone, aren't you?

937
01:20:23,721 --> 01:20:25,854
It has to end.

938
01:20:31,754 --> 01:20:34,421
Hey.

939
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,187
Be careful in there.

940
01:20:37,788 --> 01:20:40,755
So are you worried about me then?

941
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:43,488
Well, I've gotten used to you.

942
01:20:46,087 --> 01:20:47,687
Good hunting.

943
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:49,821
You, too.

944
01:21:21,587 --> 01:21:22,919
The Sentinel.

945
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:24,787
And it won't stop until this prisoner

946
01:21:24,821 --> 01:21:27,920
is put back in his cell.

947
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:37,086
It's coming for Ellic.

948
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,121
Kaulder?

949
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,388
If there's any sign she's
getting hurt in there,

950
01:23:31,422 --> 01:23:33,554
you have to wake her up.

951
01:23:33,588 --> 01:23:34,853
And promise me you'll get her as far away

952
01:23:34,887 --> 01:23:36,053
from here as you can.

953
01:23:36,087 --> 01:23:38,021
Of course.

954
01:24:45,554 --> 01:24:48,354
The chanting stopped.

955
01:24:49,753 --> 01:24:51,886
She did it.

956
01:25:44,654 --> 01:25:47,987
A dream-walker
shows your past.

957
01:25:48,021 --> 01:25:50,886
Only I can show the future.

958
01:25:52,187 --> 01:25:55,986
You will fail, and humanity will fall.

959
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,787
I've taken this world back.

960
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:06,754
Not yet.

961
01:26:12,121 --> 01:26:14,121
Can you feel it?

962
01:26:14,155 --> 01:26:16,820
Your mortality?

963
01:26:16,854 --> 01:26:20,421
Your life ebbing away?

964
01:26:57,188 --> 01:26:59,121
<i>Father!</i>

965
01:27:03,587 --> 01:27:05,053
Kaulder.

966
01:27:11,188 --> 01:27:13,553
<i>You are trespassers on our world.</i>

967
01:27:13,587 --> 01:27:15,587
<i>Father!</i>

968
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:17,453
<i>I've seen it in your eyes.</i>

969
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:20,553
<i>You wish for death.</i>

970
01:27:52,455 --> 01:27:55,587
You know the benefit of eternal life?

971
01:27:55,621 --> 01:27:57,587
I get to kill you twice.

972
01:27:59,054 --> 01:28:00,552
Stop!

973
01:28:00,586 --> 01:28:02,754
Kaulder!

974
01:28:02,788 --> 01:28:04,087
Now...

975
01:28:04,121 --> 01:28:05,421
- Chloe...
- I'm sorry.

976
01:28:05,455 --> 01:28:08,154
Release my Queen.

977
01:28:08,188 --> 01:28:10,652
Those witches you rescued
me from when I was a kid...

978
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:13,819
They didn't kill my parents.
They were my parents.

979
01:28:13,853 --> 01:28:15,453
But sadly, I was born without magic.

980
01:28:15,486 --> 01:28:16,454
You're a witch.

981
01:28:16,487 --> 01:28:18,421
Yep.

982
01:28:20,053 --> 01:28:22,586
- No! No!
- Get back here!

983
01:28:24,486 --> 01:28:26,653
Get away from him! Let go!

984
01:28:39,554 --> 01:28:41,487
Dream-walker.

985
01:29:37,821 --> 01:29:39,452
Look at you,

986
01:29:39,486 --> 01:29:42,953
you ugly bitch of a morning.

987
01:29:54,654 --> 01:29:56,453
You turned against those

988
01:29:56,487 --> 01:29:57,987
you were charged with protecting.

989
01:29:58,021 --> 01:29:59,887
Yes, my Queen.

990
01:29:59,921 --> 01:30:03,054
Make me whole. Help me reach my destiny.

991
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:05,519
Grant me the gift of magic.

992
01:30:05,553 --> 01:30:08,019
Clay cannot be turned to gold.

993
01:30:08,053 --> 01:30:11,887
Without magic, you're just a human.

994
01:30:39,586 --> 01:30:41,519
Father?

995
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,653
My love.

996
01:30:52,187 --> 01:30:54,519
You must get up.

997
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,721
Father, you need to get up.

998
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:02,886
Save them.

999
01:31:09,521 --> 01:31:13,021
Go, my love. Fight.

1000
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,787
You cling to your pathetic life.

1001
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:58,787
And for what reason?

1002
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:02,886
Those closest to you betray you,

1003
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,620
and those you claim to protect
don't even know your name.

1004
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,520
By iron

1005
01:32:13,187 --> 01:32:15,419
and fire!

1006
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,687
Try doing that with an iPad.

1007
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:35,120
Kaulder!

1008
01:33:35,154 --> 01:33:37,088
Kaulder?

1009
01:33:42,487 --> 01:33:44,552
Kaulder?

1010
01:34:20,954 --> 01:34:23,552
As long as the Hexen heart beats,

1011
01:34:23,586 --> 01:34:26,020
she's never truly dead.

1012
01:34:27,653 --> 01:34:30,053
No, you can't! You'll die.

1013
01:34:31,487 --> 01:34:32,953
I'm ready to face that reality.

1014
01:34:32,987 --> 01:34:35,853
No! There must be another way.

1015
01:34:35,887 --> 01:34:38,620
Listen to me.

1016
01:34:38,654 --> 01:34:40,786
When I was pulled into the shadows,

1017
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:44,152
I saw that there were
things much worse than her.

1018
01:34:44,186 --> 01:34:47,687
In the darkness. Waiting.

1019
01:34:47,721 --> 01:34:49,986
Waiting for what?

1020
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,986
The world without you.

1021
01:34:53,186 --> 01:34:56,487
We still need you.

1022
01:34:56,521 --> 01:34:58,854
I need you.

1023
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:05,786
The Axe and Cross betrayed me.

1024
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,152
I can't trust anyone.

1025
01:35:07,186 --> 01:35:09,387
You can trust me.

1026
01:35:11,988 --> 01:35:14,853
800 years I've been on this road.

1027
01:35:19,753 --> 01:35:22,953
Always hunting.

1028
01:35:22,987 --> 01:35:26,053
- Always...
- Alone.

1029
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:28,553
You wouldn't be.

1030
01:35:35,086 --> 01:35:37,652
Besides,

1031
01:35:37,686 --> 01:35:40,953
you still owe me fifty thousand dollars.

1032
01:35:42,119 --> 01:35:43,653
Five thousand.

1033
01:35:43,687 --> 01:35:46,820
Oh. So we're negotiating, then?

1034
01:35:55,052 --> 01:35:57,119
The Axe and Cross would be bothered that

1035
01:35:57,153 --> 01:35:58,394
they're no longer in possession

1036
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,954
of the Queen's heart.

1037
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:02,819
I don't serve The Axe and Cross anymore.

1038
01:36:02,853 --> 01:36:04,820
This time I do it for me.

1039
01:36:04,854 --> 01:36:06,787
Well, it's about time.

1040
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:11,086
You know, I used to think

1041
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,687
the universe ran in endless circles,

1042
01:36:13,721 --> 01:36:16,887
always repeating itself,
always predictable.

1043
01:36:18,453 --> 01:36:20,387
And now?

1044
01:36:22,186 --> 01:36:25,586
I don't know what happens next.

1045
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:28,854
Do you know what we mortals call that?

1046
01:36:28,888 --> 01:36:30,887
Living.

1047
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:38,653
You know,

1048
01:36:38,687 --> 01:36:41,619
I still need you.

1049
01:36:41,653 --> 01:36:43,854
Well, then

1050
01:36:43,888 --> 01:36:46,053
I'm at your service.

1051
01:36:48,486 --> 01:36:51,019
Come on. You're not getting any younger.

1052
01:36:54,653 --> 01:36:56,886
So you ready to go, or what?

1053
01:36:58,621 --> 01:37:00,554
I'm driving.

1054
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:06,018
Okay.

1055
01:37:29,453 --> 01:37:34,448
