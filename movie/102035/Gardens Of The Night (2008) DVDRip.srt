1
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:29,737
<i>She reached a large
plain where the light shone.</i>

2
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:35,805
<i>He spent a long time since
the Mowgli had moved away from his people.</i>

3
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:42,568
<i>"I'll see," she said,
"Let's see how people are changed."</i>

4
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:47,882
<i>The cabin door opened and
a woman emerged from the darkness.</i>

5
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:52,696
<i>"Who called you," the woman said.
With an anxious tone.</i>

6
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:59,145
<i>"Remember," said Mowgli.
His throat was dry when he spoke.</i>

7
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:11,312
- Have you ever stayed in a shelter before?
- Just in passing, but never overnight.

8
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:15,955
Both parents are dead, right?

9
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,428
- Leslie?
- Yes.

10
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:25,636
How old were you when they die?
Sorry, must have been very difficult.

11
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:29,060
- How old were you?
- About seven.

12
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:34,442
No, he was eight. Eight years.

13
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:43,884
And you had any close relative with whom they live,
to take care of you?

14
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:52,273
- An uncle. We live with an uncle.
- We? Who are these "we"? You and who else?

15
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:55,477
My brother.

16
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:14,338
Trixie, come on, girl!
Come on, Trixie!

17
00:04:16,163 --> 00:04:19,161
Trixie, we have to go now!

18
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,269
Where are you, girl?

19
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:25,664
Come on, Trixie!

20
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,769
Where are you?

21
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:31,623
Hey, baby, you live near here?

22
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,539
Have you seen my dog? A white terrier
with black patches around the eyes?

23
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,931
- No.
- Oh balls, we were here to work and

24
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:43,329
then came a big farmer and
went out together. I've looked everywhere.

25
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:47,485
- I'm a farmer.
- A farmer tan?

26
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:51,219
- Did you see if he was playing with a small
white terrier? - No.

27
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:53,949
Are you sure?

28
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,470
- How do you call your dog?
- Elvis.

29
00:04:56,556 --> 00:05:00,887
Elvis? It's a good name.
My dog \u200b\u200bis named Trixie.

30
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,893
- Do you think she might be playing in your garden?
- No idea.

31
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,428
- Your mother is at home?
- She is at work.

32
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,440
Yes? I bet they are now
even destroy the garden of his father.

33
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:14,662
Can we go see?
Too fast? C'mon!

34
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,930
Come on, sweetie.

35
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,029
- Hello, Elvis.
- Hey, Elvis.

36
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,702
Viste a Trixie?
Trixie!

37
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:30,601
Come on, Trixie!

38
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:31,979
Come here, girl!

39
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:37,258
Thanks for helping me look.
I'll see the kennel, will probably be there.

40
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,241
From time to time, behaves badly.

41
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:44,586
Are you going to school?
Oh no, I'm slow you down.

42
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,200
Sorry.
For school going?

43
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:50,962
- St. Andrews. - St. Andrews? I know where you stand.
For the sides of Hoover?

44
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:54,950
C'mon, I give you a ride!

45
00:05:55,036 --> 00:06:00,503
Come in, we're still in time.
Come on.

46
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,620
Why not?

47
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:06,008
- What was your name again?
- Leslie.

48
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:09,583
Leslie, I'm Alex and this is Frank.

49
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:16,882
St. Andrews. Mrs. Williams
continues to teach music there?

50
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:24,087
Has red hair, should look a certain age.
She always played tuba, really badly.

51
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:35,331
It's your lucky day, Leslie. I took a shortcut,
it used to take when I went to school.

52
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,725
- As you said that was your nickname?
- Whitehead.

53
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,427
Whitehead?

54
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,981
Mr. Whitehead is your father?

55
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:48,989
Oh my God, can you believe it! We
worked for Mr. Whitehead, it's our boss!

56
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:53,607
- In the water company?
- Yes! In the water company!

57
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:57,767
You know, I work there
almost as long as he is.

58
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:02,218
Sometimes I do errands for him. I think it was me
who bought your last birthday.

59
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:06,402
- Did you get a great doll for your birthday?
- No.

60
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,934
It's still something we need, right Frank.

61
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,844
What will he say when you know that we give a ride
to his daughter not to be late to school?

62
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:19,866
Here we are.
Ok

63
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,904
Have a nice day.

64
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:09,889
<i>I'm almost done my homework,
I just have a long last chapter.</i>

65
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,337
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,668
- Hello, Leslie. Soon, we'll give you a lift.
- What?

67
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:58,141
Your father asked us to take you,
there is a problem in the water company.

68
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:01,478
- I'm going home.
- They are not there, honey.

69
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,925
- Where are they?
- Come in, then I explain it to you.

70
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,855
Come on, Leslie.
Get in the car.

71
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,767
Your father is in trouble,
we must go immediately.

72
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:13,080
- Where is my mother?
- She went to him directly from work.

73
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,984
- Why did not they came for me?
- Because they asked us to do so.

74
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,531
It was urgent. We took you to them.
Come on. So come on!

75
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,376
Ok We take you to them.
Do not worry.

76
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:33,230
Why can not they waited for me?
I'm not understand.

77
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:37,117
Everything happened very fast. Your father called me
the office and asked me to come get it.

78
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:41,383
He said: "I'm having some small problems, but
nothing serious. "So do not worry.

79
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:46,668
Just eat your hamburger and drink your drink,
and then we took you back soon.

80
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:50,688
Go there.
Bebe.

81
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,508
- You have to make a phone call, Alex?
- Yes, indeed.

82
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,164
If anyone sees a cabin
telephone, I will call there.

83
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,852
Yes, she is with us
and all is well.

84
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:09,461
Ok, no problem.
We heard you, Mr. Whitehead.

85
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,968
Ok Thanks. Goodbye.

86
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,909
It was your father and he said it's all
in order. He'll call us later.

87
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:28,784
- When can I go home?
- Soon. Now drink your drink, darling.

88
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,073
It's hot.

89
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,189
If you drink this whole
then after I give you a cold.

90
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:46,527
Come on, drink it.

91
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:09,401
Where are we?

92
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:19,117
Okay, guys! It's time to take a bath!

93
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:26,937
Ok, now you undress and jump into it.

94
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,005
Come on, Leslie. It's just
a bath, you will not bite.

95
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,660
I'm also shy.

96
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:59,253
Hey, you gotta rub well
if you want to stay clean. Ok?

97
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,218
Nobody likes boys with dirty hair.

98
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:09,083
Leslie has already told you
a dog called Elvis?

99
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:14,279
Yellow is a farmer.
Right, honey?

100
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:18,650
Where is Trixie?

101
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:23,143
- What, Who...?
- Your dog Trixie.

102
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:33,051
The Trixie, well... Frank tried to throughout
city, but still could not find it...

103
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:35,781
so I think she must be lost.

104
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,322
Poor Trixie.

105
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:43,432
Walking around lost.

106
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:49,878
Excuse me.

107
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,478
Hello?
Mr. Whitehead!

108
00:15:57,564 --> 00:16:01,620
It is Alex.
Yes, she's fine.

109
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:05,929
<i>... And for how long?</i>

110
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:09,588
<i>Are you sure?</i>

111
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:18,998
<i>Okay, wait a second, we like to have
us. We waited until you return. Ok!</i>

112
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:23,656
They still are not back.

113
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,744
Hey, how is your hair?
Do not want to wash?

114
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,242
I do not believe you.
I do not believe you.

115
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:35,177
- What did I do wrong?
- Nothing.

116
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:39,976
I want to connect them. I want to talk to them.
They would not abandon me.

117
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:43,155
Will you, I know
phone number of your father.

118
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:46,003
You can!

119
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:21,424
It's okay, honey. We're here.
Let us take care of you.

120
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,881
I, Frank and Donny, Donny is not?

121
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:32,509
We take care of you.
So do not worry, everything will be OK.

122
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:36,167
- I want to talk to them.
- Sure you do.

123
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:40,572
Why do not you guard your phone number
with you, and you may want to reconnect.

124
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:47,176
Ok? Frank should be here
new clothes for you.

125
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:53,512
Let us pray.

126
00:17:57,434 --> 00:18:03,914
Lord, bless the food we have received
We are very grateful.

127
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,976
Bless this house and all residents and looks
by the mother of Donny, hoped to return soon.

128
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:18,738
Bless the parents of Leslie
and helps them through this difficult period.

129
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:23,157
So they can return to it.
Amen.

130
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:33,522
Good appetite.

131
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:58,219
You walk in school?

132
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:03,993
What does it say here?

133
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:10,372
- Action Jack. You do not you read?
- No.

134
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:39,205
I actually said
you could take that cookie?

135
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:43,752
That's what I said? No, I
not say that you could eat.

136
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,677
What do you say?

137
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,028
It seems you do not pretend to listen.

138
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:58,677
I'll tell you a little secret?

139
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:05,460
Your father and your mother does not want you anymore.

140
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:09,068
They have not phoned or written, so...

141
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:12,942
it seems they are very happy without you.

142
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,613
Sometimes things are very weird...

143
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:58,093
and no use trying to understand,
because you'll never understand.

144
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:02,518
Why are they doing this to you.

145
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,426
Maybe Frank was right.

146
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:11,041
Whatever the reason,
even if your father and mother.

147
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:16,160
Life is difficult.
And if she is going badly for them,

148
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:25,038
then suddenly you are away, nobody knows why
but your life can be a little more easy here.

149
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:32,218
Your father, he was always
only a few days with you, right?

150
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,824
Your mother told you it was because of work.

151
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,902
But he did not even have time to buy you a
gift for your birthday, remember?

152
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:43,588
Remember?

153
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:48,560
I bought them for him for you.

154
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:53,309
My father was like yours.

155
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:58,415
I remember that he was
a long time traveling...

156
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:06,284
and then came home and got together all the
night, playing and reading to me.

157
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,011
And I remember I thought this
was the best night of my life.

158
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:20,612
And then he said: "I have to go buy a pack
cigarettes, but I'll be right back, do not worry. "

159
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:29,347
But he never returned.
And I never went back to see him.

160
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,940
So I know how you feel, dear.

161
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:39,014
I know I could never be your father,
I look to him or take his place...

162
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:46,523
but I could be like an uncle... Uncle Alex.

163
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,959
Rest a little.

164
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:27,111
- Are you crying?
- No.

165
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:34,501
Good. You can not cry, no one likes
girls crying, girls seem ugly.

166
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:38,775
Then you'll be a beautiful girl, huh.

167
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:47,573
- The Alex's favorite girl.
- And you are my favorite boy.

168
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,238
Start the car.

169
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,798
Leslie, this is Orlando.
He is a good friend of ours.

170
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:22,943
He will take care of you for a while, ok.
You must do everything he tells you.

171
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:26,871
- Ok
- She realized.

172
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:29,426
Do not worry.
She looks good.

173
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:33,205
- Ok
- Go up to bed.

174
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:38,762
The only thing I want
is to have fun, Leslie.

175
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,098
It can also be fun for you.

176
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:55,671
Ever... Shoe Shine
your father to earn a dollar?

177
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:59,826
Have you ever did on the something like this?

178
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:05,523
Mowing the lawn, wash the car?

179
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:11,787
I think that's what little boys do,
mow the lawn and wash and car.

180
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:23,571
You understand, if you you do something,
receive a reward.

181
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,811
You work as you usually do...

182
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:31,316
As in school...

183
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:36,707
rather than just good grades,
earned money.

184
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,539
If you can earn enough money,
you will not need to sleep on the street.

185
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:50,219
You do not want that to happen.
On the streets where the demons live.

186
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:54,919
On the street you can lose yourself forever.

187
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:15,469
Hey baby, what's going on?

188
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:19,987
Are you afraid?

189
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:25,636
What we do is good.

190
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:29,324
It's beautiful.

191
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:38,100
It is because of me?
It is the color of my skin?

192
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:43,226
This is not anything that you may be afraid
I feel exactly the same as you.

193
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:50,236
Want to play?

194
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:58,205
There is nothing wrong with it.
You know that?

195
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:04,733
I am sure that this is still unknown
for you, you know, except you.

196
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,789
There is nothing wrong with playing.

197
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:12,625
Everyone does.

198
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:22,005
Teachers do, doctors do,
police do.

199
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:25,045
Everyone does.

200
00:28:25,131 --> 00:28:28,356
Even his father does.

201
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:34,249
Your father has had touched you,
if you had stayed at home.

202
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:39,116
- Very soon, he would have you touched.
- No!

203
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,621
- What?
- No!

204
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:44,665
I want you!
Come here!

205
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:50,860
Shut up!
Shut up!

206
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:55,226
I was talking to you!
I tried to be nice, bitch!

207
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:58,740
What the hell are you doing with it?

208
00:29:07,017 --> 00:29:11,444
Honey, it's okay.
It's okay, honey.

209
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,855
It's okay.

210
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:19,792
- What the hell happened?
- Get in the car. Go! Go!

211
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:25,834
Christ, Alex. Fuck!

212
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,062
I told you that you would always protect?

213
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:33,574
Do not let this happen again,
because I will not allow.

214
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,116
Hey! This is murder, man!
This is murder, fuck it!

215
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:42,648
- We are all involved.
- It's all right, Frank. No one saw us!

216
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:47,252
The only thing we have to do
is to keep us together. And to rely on each other.

217
00:29:56,968 --> 00:30:01,028
Leslie, now we are all part of something terrible.

218
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:09,916
But if we help each other and
to rely on each other, then everything is fine.

219
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:12,043
You know you?

220
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:16,473
Because I will not say anything to anyone
and you do not, do you?

221
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,624
No.

222
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,372
Do not worry.

223
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:52,154
Why they left me here?

224
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,482
I hate them!
I hate them!

225
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,195
Lesley...

226
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:04,439
Leslie!

227
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,755
It's okay, honey.

228
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:18,064
Forget the past, dear
You have to leave it behind.

229
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:25,900
It's like a caterpillar, it has to shake his
skin off to become a beautiful butterfly.

230
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:29,885
And you think that the caterpillar does not suffer?

231
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:36,325
Of course, dear. But this is the only way
it becomes a beautiful butterfly.

232
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:43,553
And this is where you you will become.
Something very, very beautiful.

233
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,402
Leslie, I think you're beautiful.

234
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:56,788
Leslie, I'll never hurt you.
I'll never hurt you, baby.

235
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:01,697
It's okay, honey.
It's okay now.

236
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,606
It's okay.

237
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:12,220
<i>You got me.
You got me, baby. It's okay.</i>

238
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:17,609
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

239
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:27,018
<i>"Something is up the hill,
said the mother wolf to Mowgli. "</i>

240
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,275
<i>Get ready.</i>

241
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:34,133
<i>Behind the bushes was a small wolf
sitting in the lap of his father, ready to go.</i>

242
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:38,438
<i>"People," he said. "Young people. Look."</i>

243
00:33:38,524 --> 00:33:45,198
<i>Directly in front of him, a low branch,
was a naked brown baby...</i>

244
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:47,605
<i>I could barely walk.</i>

245
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:54,967
<i>So fast and smoothly the evening came
and the wolves disappeared to his cave.</i>

246
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:57,931
<i>He looked at the face of the father wolf and laughed.</i>

247
00:33:58,017 --> 00:34:02,853
<i>"Is it that men are like that," said the mother wolf.
"I've never seen one before."</i>

248
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:10,207
<i>Bring him here. Small, naked
and so courageous, "said Mother Wolf softly.</i>

249
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:16,157
<i>The baby took the wrong road between the boy
to approach and appeal.</i>

250
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:19,676
<i>He will eat with the others.</i>

251
00:34:19,762 --> 00:34:22,481
<i>He looks like a toad, "said the father wolf.</i>

252
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:27,744
<i>Then we call it that,
Mowgli the frog.</i>

253
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:39,194
<i>We should have a name secret between us.</i>

254
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,320
<i>I can be Mowgli and you can be the Wolf.</i>

255
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:48,808
<i>- Who are they?
- They are the great apes....</i>

256
00:34:57,288 --> 00:35:02,240
<i>The Mowgli is lost in
jungle and the Wolf will find me,</i>

257
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:05,400
<i>and protect me from evil monkeys nuts.</i>

258
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:10,988
<i>This is our forest
and nobody will come here.</i>

259
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:38,353
I once had a birthday party.
It was with an old woman.

260
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:42,975
She made me a cake
a chocolate cake.

261
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:46,933
He had five candles on top.

262
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:51,429
- Why you ran away from home?
- My mother was crazy...

263
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:56,151
She said she used drugs at the library.

264
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:02,313
- And then your father?
- He lives in a caravan somewhere.

265
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:07,205
- Where's your mother?
- They put her in a hospital.

266
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:11,587
That was why they had to sell you?

267
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:21,174
You have more photos like these?

268
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,401
- I do not...
- No matter, I'll get some more.

269
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:30,106
Then they go in the book.
The book will go nationwide.

270
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:32,677
I'll send it by FEDEX.

271
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:36,655
If they like what they see, you will have
with the client or the client comes to you.

272
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,872
If children I fly with them.

273
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:46,638
I treat the new identity.
Divided 50/50. Profitable and safe.

274
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:50,968
- Sure, sounds good.
- This is important.

275
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:59,766
- We partner discount, so
if anything... - No, I do not.

276
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:03,883
Sorry, I do not.
I'm not like that.

277
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:06,854
- Me neither.
- Right. Good

278
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:11,908
Anyway... So nice children.
Adorable.

279
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:17,431
Yes they are. But do not want to see the fly.

280
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:23,982
- Ok
- Okay?

281
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:29,611
- Maybe another time.
- Yes, maybe.

282
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:45,947
Ok, so... tomas one bath.

283
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:49,617
Tomas a bath first, I like that.

284
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:53,914
Do not forget, is a free county.

285
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,954
It will be okay.

286
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,155
You know where you are going?
Home of a judge.

287
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:01,839
You know what that means?

288
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:05,484
It is a good person. The judges are fair,
are always doing good things.

289
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,996
So, do what thou wilt. If the Judge
say okay, okay.

290
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:22,824
I just leave you only with good people.

291
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:26,843
With good people.

292
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:31,184
People like your parents.

293
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:35,875
Ok?

294
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:42,964
Come on.

295
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:49,485
<i>"Look, Mowgli," said Wolf.</i>

296
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:53,650
<i>"I'll give you all the rules
Jungle for the people of the jungle. "</i>

297
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:57,432
<i>Except for the monkeys
living in trees.</i>

298
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:02,804
<i>They have no rules,
are proscribed.</i>

299
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,370
<i>They have no proper language,</i>

300
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:09,241
<i>but use words stolen
that they intercepted,</i>

301
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:14,109
<i>pending
hidden behind the branches.</i>

302
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,645
You're already dressed...

303
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:26,144
Why not dress it?

304
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:33,552
<i>Your ways are not our ways,
they have no leader, no memory.</i>

305
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:40,962
<i>They are both happy to pretend they are great
people to do great things in the jungle.</i>

306
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,835
- Who is she?
- A friend of mine, Jimmy...

307
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:46,194
came by to greet me.

308
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,373
And I said it was good for
she leave it here a bit.

309
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:53,098
- He will return soon?
- Yes.

310
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:57,891
- How is your name?
- Leslie.

311
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:01,876
Want to climb with me
stairs and play a little?

312
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,804
Girls, I want to take care of Leslie.
She will stay with us a little bit, okay?

313
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:14,655
The father and I then saw
tell you good night.

314
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,355
I do not see any.

315
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:25,712
Everything became funny.

316
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:29,868
The tourists know they are going to die?

317
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:34,602
- Everything seems to go so slow.
- Yes.

318
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:37,655
Yes, indeed.

319
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:41,556
Be right back.

320
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:58,172
What?

321
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:04,719
- The cold is over. The ice, the ice cream over.
- Why is it over?

322
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:09,112
What the fuck.

323
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,486
- Only a few brain cells every time.
- I just wanted to use them as a sweet tooth.

324
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:18,668
I just let it unfold
as you do, that's all.

325
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,840
Want ice cream?

326
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:30,865
Yes? So you, Donny, do you want ice cream?
So we buy the ice cream shop.

327
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:34,495
- Alex.
- Who wants to sit on my back?

328
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:40,268
Each day of the year alone.
What you'll want to eat, Leslie?

329
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:44,160
- Strawberry, chocolate...
- Strawberries.

330
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:56,995
We have ice cream with chunks of walnuts.

331
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:04,229
We flavored with vanilla, any variety
chocolate. Black, milk, white chocolate.

332
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:08,268
Strawberries, blueberries.
We may also combine three flavors together.

333
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:13,405
<i>This is one of my favorites.
And then there's the "Rocky Road".</i>

334
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:31,645
- They are $ 7.95.
- Keep the change.

335
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:35,324
Here you are.
Thanks!

336
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,759
I want to share, but I want
get the first part of the Rocky Road.

337
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:02,598
C'mon! Come on!
Arise!

338
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:08,185
Little fuss.
Shut up.

339
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,464
Alex! Alex!

340
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,435
Quick! Quick!

341
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:26,668
Alex, what the hell are you doing?
C'mon!

342
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:29,919
Their faces are all here!

343
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,039
Come on! Come on!

344
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:47,713
- Turn left, left.
- I can not, there is a one truck!

345
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,189
- Try to sing a song.
- What?

346
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:53,375
Tries to sing a song, please!

347
00:45:09,198 --> 00:45:10,953
They schemed us!

348
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,749
- Lower yourself, your little shit!
- What are you doing coming back here again?

349
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:16,202
- Where are you going?
- I am trying to find a way out of here.

350
00:45:16,288 --> 00:45:18,826
Everything was in our favor.
Everything.

351
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:21,579
- They have nothing.
- Bullshit!

352
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:26,413
Are precisely the people's ice cream shop.
What were they doing there?

353
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:29,065
How do I know?

354
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:32,593
It was you.
You...!

355
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,682
- Do not blame Leslie!
- Why?

356
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:36,762
- Think a bit!
- She fucked up!

357
00:45:36,848 --> 00:45:41,650
She has no guilt!
Leslie never said anything!

358
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:46,345
Well no, dear?
Because we have a little secret, right?

359
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:52,452
We have a secret. Frank.
Sai outside. Get out!

360
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:01,394
<i>- Stay away from me, bitch!
- Easy, boy.</i>

361
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,649
<i>- Do not touch me, Alex! Do not touch me!
- Calm yourself.</i>

362
00:46:04,735 --> 00:46:08,005
<i>- We'll escape this, okay?
- What do we do?</i>

363
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:12,833
<i>I'll think of something.
Now calm down.</i>

364
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:42,751
<i>- So early tomorrow, but should be good.
- Yes, yes. Understood. I appreciate that.</i>

365
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:47,363
<i>- I have dealt with everything, okay?
- Must be good stuff.</i>

366
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,773
<i>I'll give you everything
what I have to offer.</i>

367
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,945
Is very nervous today!
Let me see what you have.

368
00:46:58,031 --> 00:47:01,126
- This is all good stuff?
- Yes, everything.

369
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:04,653
Bob, you know what?
You will earn a bonus.

370
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,877
Ok?
Now give me the money!

371
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:13,290
They are really good looking!

372
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:18,199
- You know that place where...
- Yes!

373
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:21,439
Which has a large placard of Coca-Cola?

374
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:29,484
<i> The last thing I remember the Mowgli was
feel his hands on his arms and legs. </ i>

375
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:33,070
<i> And then the branches hit your face. </ i>

376
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:36,507
<i> And then he sits there looking down
to trees full of vines, </ i>

377
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:43,367
<i> as the monkeys scream
triumphant from the treetops. </ i>

378
00:47:44,243 --> 00:47:45,967
<i> Then they begin their long journey. </ i>

379
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:53,723
<i> A trip with us to Cheer Monkey Land.
is one of those things nobody can describe. </ i>

380
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,430
Let's make a promise, Donny.

381
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:12,401
What promise?

382
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:15,334
Vamos ficar sempre juntos. Sempre.

383
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,206
Se algo acontecer e isso não for possível,
vamos encontrar-nos num certo sítio.

384
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:24,419
Ok. Onde?

385
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:36,458
Meet me there.
In Wonderland. Ok

386
00:48:36,544 --> 00:48:39,093
Ok

387
00:49:46,265 --> 00:49:48,751
Arise. </ P> We slept late. </ P> <i> Hey, you want a ride </ i>

388
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,967
- Ok, let's go.
- You've got a home

389
00:52:55,276 --> 00:52:58,138
- Excuse me, sir. This is my sister.
- Donny, what are you doing? </ P> I have no idea what she told you
but she is very romantic. </ P>

390
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:07,146
You know, flowers, Margarita's, quiet music...

391
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:10,619
Do we agree now, damn

392
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:14,376
This lady takes us in its beak. 
She does not like such scenes.

393
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:17,997
So maybe you should try something more...
Come, run away

394
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,294
- Let's call your wife , you pervert!
- Give me the radius of my phone

395
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,379
Esta senhora leva-nos no bico.
Ela não gosta desse tipo de cenas.

396
00:53:24,465 --> 00:53:29,172
Então talvez você devesse tentar algo mais ...
Vamos lá, foge!

397
00:53:29,258 --> 00:53:34,417
- Vamos ligar para a sua esposa, seu pervertido!
- Devolve-me o raio do meu telemóvel!

398
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:57,947
- What does it say there?
- Armed Forces.

399
00:53:59,591 --> 00:54:02,179
What does that mean?

400
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,647
Guns, bombs, etc..

401
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:08,800
Why does not say directly, weapons

402
00:54:08,886 --> 00:54:10,806
Arms... I mean...

403
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:15,611
I bet a lot of people
should find the same crap that I...

404
00:54:15,697 --> 00:54:19,486
Forces. </ P> Weapon... Armed...

405
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,337
<i> We can not enter this war unprepared

406
00:54:30,904 --> 00:54:33,147
<i> is important for us to know < br /> number and strength of their armaments. </ i>

407
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:38,582
Armas.

408
00:54:38,668 --> 00:54:40,239
<i> But brother, any action...</ i>

409
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:44,324
So, my

Hey, man, what is...?< br /> You're crazy, man!

411
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:05,008
How are you?

412
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:12,327
You are crazy, fucking my

413
00:55:12,594 --> 00:55:15,181
Tu estás maluco, porra meu!

414
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:21,761
Now everything is fine with me

415
00:55:21,847 --> 00:55:25,567
other kind, which...

416
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:29,270
... It is a coward. </ P> Excuse me, sir. Been to any bar?
Cheap drinks, the best sex in the city. </ P> The best part is you do not have to pay anything,
you just have to sit and watch and...!

417
00:55:31,897 --> 00:55:38,838
Come on, think about it! We have young girls, we
coals hot babes, come on! </ P> <i> can get me some change. </ I>

418
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:42,924
Ok, man. How much you want for this phone? </ P> I do not know.
About 100 or 120. </ P> Are you serious? </ P> <i> Come on, man. It is a beautiful phone. </ I>

419
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:47,200
I find myself with you in the "Boar"

420
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:50,333
You have no fear of...

421
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:57,151
Ok, pá. Quanto queres por esse telemóvel?

422
00:55:57,237 --> 00:56:00,144
Eu não sei.
Cerca de 100 ou 120.

423
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:03,641
Estás a falar a sério?

424
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,757
<i>Vá lá, meu. É um belo telemóvel.</i>

425
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:27,447
Eu encontro-me contigo no "Boar"!

426
00:56:32,646 --> 00:56:36,149
Tu não tens medo da ...

427
00:56:36,235 --> 00:56:41,090
your friend into a car and never come back

428
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:07,899
Is everything okay?

429
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:12,087
Great! I'm almost done. </ P> Hey, Leslie!
Come

430
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:58,624
Hey, want to fuck a little while, okay?
It is close by.

431
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:02,602
- What is it? How are you?
- Hey, Cooper. I'm fine. </ P> - If you want a date, I have one for you on
motorway. - Yeah, right. </ P> - Are you still with that kid?
- Yes

432
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,469
Why are you still with him?
He is the man of your life

433
00:58:05,555 --> 00:58:10,760
- I think not.
- Yes, but do you think.

434
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:16,200
Listen, dear friends are people who do not fuck
before.

435
00:58:16,286 --> 00:58:20,874
Are you sure you're okay?
All is well.

436
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,538
I'm fine.

437
00:58:23,624 --> 00:58:27,933
Look.

438
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:34,026
Tens a certeza que está tudo bem?
Tudo está bem.

439
00:58:34,112 --> 00:58:36,736
Eu estou óptima.

440
00:58:38,011 --> 00:58:40,101
Olha.

441
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:45,735
- Take this. A gift.
- Thanks. </ P> You see the black bastards of our neighbors. </ P> Do you remember Donna?
She's still that way.

442
00:58:46,943 --> 00:58:49,850
She also wanted to be like you.
I wanted to be independent.

443
00:58:49,936 --> 00:58:54,886
But that's okay.
One day a gang of blacks came in here </ p >

444
00:58:55,953 --> 00:59:00,744
fucked her, took her,
directly and placed them in the street.

445
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:07,556
Want to know why they like working with
white girls

446
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:15,086
To receive money from the whites.

447
00:59:15,172 --> 00:59:18,230
Who are you fucks.

448
00:59:18,316 --> 00:59:21,663
Hey Leslie, I want to show you something.
come with me?

449
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:25,364
You know the refuge on the streets of India

450
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:33,084
What do you think of going there
and get her out there?

451
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:13,290
- To ti?
- Yes

452
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:17,431
O que achas de ir até lá
e tirá-la de lá para fora?

453
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:21,616
- Para ti?
- Sim.

454
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,778
But first I want you change your hairstyle, then
then bring it to me.

455
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:27,139
I'm not one ray of a stupid goose.

456
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:30,749
I know, but...
not have your special abilities, right?

457
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:34,974
I mean, it tells you how I can help
, and then bring it here.

458
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,880
I helped her a lot of times now and she left.

459
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:43,482
I'm offering you something very special here.

460
01:00:43,568 --> 01:00:48,449
I know you.
When close your eyes can you see something better.

461
01:00:48,535 --> 01:00:51,306
I can imagine the people I know.

462
01:00:51,392 --> 01:00:55,121
You will not need to beg for more money
again.

463
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:58,988
Okay?
Think about this.

464
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:41,102
Hey, how are you?
I did this for you.

465
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:45,371
- Meu Deus. Obrigado.
- De nada.

466
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:51,291
- Então, o que queria o Cooper?
- Nada.

467
01:01:51,377 --> 01:01:56,605
- So he just gave you this?
- Perhaps like me.

468
01:01:56,691 --> 01:02:01,330
- Yes, he is an imbecile. What do you think?
- He's cool. Just a little tense at times. </ P> Hey guys, how are you?
Want some plants

469
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:05,421
- I'll get them when needed, ok?
- Every night.

470
01:02:05,507 --> 01:02:10,529
I'll stay awake.
So if you want to sleep all is well.

471
01:03:46,082 --> 01:03:52,256
You want me, right? Would you like me so much,
not know what to do. </ P> So feel it is so wet. </ P> I feel you... I feel it is so great...
back and forth. It's so big. Almost too big

472
01:04:39,177 --> 01:04:44,476
Tu queres-me, certo? Tu queres-me tanto,
que não sabes o que fazer.

473
01:04:44,562 --> 01:04:49,782
Então sente isto, é tão molhado.

474
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:59,857
Eu sinto-o ... eu sinto-o, é tão grande ...para trás
e para a frente. É tão grande. Quase grande demais!

475
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:05,147
Vá lá, baby. Fode-me!
Vá lá! Fode-me!

476
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:10,282
Vá lá, vem-te dentro de mim! Ejacula! Ejacula!
Vamos lá, deixa-o explodir!

477
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:13,571
Oh my God! Let it blow so hard,
that will cross up to my throat!

478
01:05:13,657 --> 01:05:22,312
Oh my God, I am come to me! I am come to me!
I am come to me. And then it came up.

479
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:26,666
Thirty-two seconds.

480
01:05:26,752 --> 01:05:31,661
It crosses my throat?
How do you remember using it.

481
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:33,862
Did you really have to talk that way?

482
01:05:33,948 --> 01:05:37,493
I remember one time...
He was a Chinese brand.

483
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:43,864
He had a small penis, very small.
A "little things".

484
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:49,062
And he said:
"You like my big dick?"

485
01:05:49,148 --> 01:05:51,430
Pila great!

486
01:05:51,516 --> 01:05:54,764
He paid me $ 100 extra I
continue to say it. I like is a big dick.

487
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,247
Why are men so
obsessed with the size of your penis?

488
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:02,183
- Because we are.
- No, this is not true. Not everyone.

489
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:05,565
- I heard how great, how good and how
I feel good... - No, no!

490
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:09,754
I do exactly the same things as you,
but you never heard me say this.

491
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,732
Maybe you do not be a
great conversationalist, Donny.

492
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:17,493
- What the hell does the word shit?
- It means that you're not there very talkative.

493
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:21,065
No, we speak.
Just do not talk of such scenes.

494
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:23,391
- And then talk about what?
- Fuck you.

495
01:06:23,477 --> 01:06:33,291
Football, man. Football and politics.
This is what we speak, those nasty things.

496
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:48,902
Understood.

497
01:06:48,988 --> 01:06:58,151
The Rat may go to Fort Lauderdale...
maybe we should go together.

498
01:06:58,237 --> 01:07:00,443
Why?

499
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:05,240
I once went to a fair
which began in March and

500
01:07:05,326 --> 01:07:06,838
traveled throughout the years, I and thou.

501
01:07:06,924 --> 01:07:13,293
Maybe we can get a job as a salesman
hot dogs or popcorn cart.

502
01:07:13,379 --> 01:07:17,716
I have some friends that last time
were very impressed with me.

503
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:21,127
They liked it very much.

504
01:07:22,082 --> 01:07:25,381
It looks very cool.

505
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:28,072
I'm tired of always changing me.

506
01:07:28,158 --> 01:07:35,036
Will not you leave the house, the pool,
the dog and everything else?

507
01:07:35,742 --> 01:07:38,744
- A dog would be cool.
- Yes.

508
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,724
A dog would be cool.

509
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,025
- Have you sold the phone?
- No, not yet signed a deal with the Rat.

510
01:07:46,111 --> 01:07:48,389
Donny, how long are you bringing
to sell the fucking phone?

511
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:53,619
I told you that the Rat would stay with him.
I'm just waiting for him.

512
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:59,819
You do not care that we
sleeping on the beach or park?

513
01:08:13,693 --> 01:08:16,836
Thanks.
Thanks.

514
01:08:33,478 --> 01:08:40,108
Do you ever wonder how is Alex, Frank and all?

515
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:45,868
- No.
- Never?

516
01:08:46,675 --> 01:08:49,826
I do not think about it.

517
01:08:53,905 --> 01:08:56,964
I think.

518
01:08:59,088 --> 01:09:04,221
I know it sounds weird, but...

519
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:09,289
without them we would never have known.

520
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:31,898
You have nothing to do with me
and I have nothing to do with you.

521
01:09:49,153 --> 01:09:54,211
Everyone should have that part.

522
01:11:39,235 --> 01:11:43,009
- How old are you, Leslie?
- Eighteen.

523
01:11:44,108 --> 01:11:47,533
I'm doing almost seventeen.

524
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:56,844
Both parents are dead?

525
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:02,588
- Yes.
- Sorry, must have been very difficult for you.

526
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:06,857
- How old were you when they die?
- Seven.

527
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:09,293
Eight.

528
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:13,454
And you had any close relative with whom they live,
to take care of you?

529
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,029
An uncle. We live with an uncle.

530
01:12:16,115 --> 01:12:21,289
- We? Who are these "we"?
- My brother.

531
01:12:26,394 --> 01:12:30,667
- Where is this uncle now?
- No idea.

532
01:12:30,753 --> 01:12:34,894
And his brother?

533
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,357
I do not know.

534
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:43,338
- Have you ever stayed in a shelter before?
- Just in passing, but never overnight.

535
01:12:43,424 --> 01:12:50,064
Okay, Leslie. No alcohol or drugs
this building or on the playground outside.

536
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:53,636
If caught, then you will be
expelled without mercy.

537
01:12:53,722 --> 01:12:57,363
Tears or whatever
will not change our decision.

538
01:12:57,449 --> 01:13:00,896
If you must smoke,
will smoke outside.

539
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:05,339
Not inside the building, okay?

540
01:13:05,425 --> 01:13:07,783
You are free to go wherever you want during the day.

541
01:13:07,869 --> 01:13:12,604
But the doors close at nine o'clock at night and
not reopen until eight o'clock in the morning.

542
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:15,184
The shelter is there to help her.

543
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:22,845
He is here to help her leave
drugs, prostitution and suicide.

544
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:28,355
You understand?

545
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:30,894
You came here for
to escape from something,

546
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:35,733
but you should leave this
thing outside, ok?

547
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:40,570
- Understand?
- Yes.

548
01:13:41,089 --> 01:13:44,724
- Do not bring it into them.
- Okay.

549
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,301
Great.

550
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:21,732
- Hi
- Hi

551
01:14:26,271 --> 01:14:33,226
- They sent me away from home.
- An orphanage. Everything has a different name.

552
01:14:33,312 --> 01:14:42,307
Sweet Mac, Player, Gorilla, Meat Dealer, is just
another name for someone to make money with you.

553
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:46,008
Strawberry was a name that someone used.

554
01:14:46,874 --> 01:14:49,007
What you have to do is your own family.

555
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:53,581
Someone keep your eyes open,
while you close your.

556
01:14:55,061 --> 01:15:01,537
This place is not better, selling drugs
in the kitchen, diverting money for yourself.

557
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:05,316
You can always save money for you.

558
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:12,876
The whole world does,
but you know not only that.

559
01:15:13,255 --> 01:15:18,661
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

560
01:15:58,556 --> 01:16:02,068
- How are you?
- Not bad, man.

561
01:16:02,154 --> 01:16:06,220
- A nice sea breeze, a magnificent night.
- How much?

562
01:16:06,306 --> 01:16:10,558
Dude, you can not keep me,
I'm too expensive for you.

563
01:16:10,644 --> 01:16:14,577
Okay, fuck you, asshole.

564
01:16:14,663 --> 01:16:18,669
Hey wait man!
Fuck! You do not realize the radius of a joke?

565
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:22,034
Laugh at this, motherfucker!

566
01:17:16,733 --> 01:17:22,047
- This is Cooper, who told you.
- You are a beautiful girl, you know?

567
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:31,115
Leslie will take care of you.
I hope there is much for you, you know?

568
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:36,564
We could say you were perfect
well, but we can still improve.

569
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:08,571
Are you sure that this
is the right thing to do?

570
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:11,990
Yes, why?

571
01:18:12,527 --> 01:18:16,922
I'm a little scared.

572
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:19,972
Hey, everything will be fine.

573
01:18:20,058 --> 01:18:22,960
You know what this is like?

574
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:26,435
It's like when a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly.

575
01:18:26,521 --> 01:18:29,655
You think that hurts?

576
01:18:29,741 --> 01:18:33,530
It's the only way she can become a butterfly.

577
01:18:33,937 --> 01:18:40,538
And this is you.
You will become something very beautiful.

578
01:18:42,582 --> 01:18:46,853
Do not worry.
I'll take care of you, okay?

579
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:50,047
- Hey, dude, where's Leslie?
- What?

580
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:52,552
Where the hell is she? You know well the
I'm talking about. Where's Leslie?

581
01:19:52,638 --> 01:19:54,317
- Man, puts you in hell.
- Fuck you!

582
01:19:54,403 --> 01:20:01,379
Listen, you idiot. I have nothing to do
with it, ok? She was, she even wanted to go.

583
01:20:02,773 --> 01:20:05,368
- What?
- You are lying, man.

584
01:20:05,454 --> 01:20:08,371
Do you think she would walk to wander
with you the rest of your life?

585
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:11,369
- That's a lie.
- These are her words, my!

586
01:20:11,455 --> 01:20:14,252
She had an opportunity to
up and you pass up the story.

587
01:20:14,338 --> 01:20:17,926
You're a loser.

588
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:38,188
What!

589
01:22:16,344 --> 01:22:24,514
I can feel it, is so great...
is so great, when entering and leaving.

590
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,466
- Fuck me, come on.
- Fuck me, little one.

591
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:35,409
Come on, you come inside me!
Ejaculates to cross over to my throat!

592
01:22:35,495 --> 01:22:40,573
Oh, baby, come on.
Oh, Baby, come on.

593
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:45,690
I am come to me.
I am come to me, little one.

594
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:53,669
Just come up. Why has not it come from?
Come up. Come to drugs! Why not come?

595
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:56,888
Get out of my way!

596
01:22:56,974 --> 01:23:01,683
I do not need this shit.
I do not need this shit!

597
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,629
Fucking crazy bitch.

598
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:27,086
<i>It's okay.</i>

599
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:32,977
<i>Forget the past, dear
You have to leave it behind.</i>

600
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:39,341
<i> You're now my girl
and this is our secret. </ i>

601
01:25:33,532 --> 01:25:38,187
<i> You do not like me, I'm just
to say to be careful. </ i>

602
01:25:38,273 --> 01:25:41,480
<i>
think I'm some kind of animal or what? </ i>

603
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:48,295
Wake up. Wake up.
Listen to me. I lied to you. </ P> These people will not protect you,
they will make thee terrible things. </ P> They will make you the worst things in the 
world, so we have to leave.

604
01:25:48,381 --> 01:25:53,774
Slow.
Come here.

605
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:59,491
Hey, you know where is the shelter, right?
Go there

606
01:26:03,376 --> 01:26:06,429
Hey, Christian, damn you! Where's Leslie?
Where's that bitch? </ P> <i> swear to God I do not know...</ i>

607
01:26:34,133 --> 01:26:40,610
You must really be the last head.
yet know surf?

608
01:26:46,315 --> 01:26:50,855
Ei, Christian, seu maldito! Onde está a Leslie?
Onde está aquela cabra?

609
01:26:50,941 --> 01:26:54,181
<i>Juro por Deus que não sei...</i>

610
01:27:23,176 --> 01:27:26,624
Tu deves ser mesmo passada da cabeça.
Ainda sabes surfar?

611
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:28,615
- also want to end up dead in a bathroom?
- I'm looking for Donny.

612
01:27:30,775 --> 01:27:35,852
The Donny? The Donny is far away, dear.
Left the city with Ratboy. </ P> He left the city?
When he left

613
01:27:35,938 --> 01:27:38,419
I do not know . But it's been a long time.
Just see if you pyres of here, okay? </ P> expected

614
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:43,655
He said where he went

615
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:45,215
Yes, look for America.

616
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,381
Leslie, you are assured that the
his father and mother are dead?

617
01:27:47,467 --> 01:27:51,194
Do you really believe that?

618
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:08,139
Are you still living in their house when they died

619
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:12,578
No.

620
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:22,810
So how do you know they are dead

621
01:28:22,896 --> 01:28:25,808
- They said me.
- They told him.

622
01:28:27,184 --> 01:28:30,432
Who told you that?

623
01:28:30,518 --> 01:28:34,193
And where was his home

624
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:37,672
Quem lhe disse isso?

625
01:28:47,537 --> 01:28:50,387
E onde era a sua casa?

626
01:28:50,473 --> 01:28:54,728
- Leslie, where is that kept?
- I do not remember.

627
01:28:55,846 --> 01:28:59,859
I think we all remember our
home.

628
01:29:05,586 --> 01:29:10,937
You know what I think?
I think you wanted to run...

629
01:29:11,023 --> 01:29:17,856
perhaps because they wanted to,
maybe not, maybe you had to do.

630
01:29:21,377 --> 01:29:28,185
And I think that's ever happened to both
time that you no longer know how to go back.

631
01:29:28,287 --> 01:29:33,458
Like the fact that we do not know if
say their parents are dead or not.

632
01:29:33,544 --> 01:29:39,617
If you can not even admit the possibility of
their parents are alive.

633
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:47,990
- Why can not admit it, Leslie? 
- They just do not want me.

634
01:29:49,072 --> 01:29:51,439
They have abandoned me and I never came
more and get me...

635
01:29:51,525 --> 01:29:57,931
I heard them on the phone and they said
"Soon." But they never came. </ P> I guess you just
heard one side of the story. </ P> Have you any idea how many children I have ever had here
last year because of a telephone conversation

636
01:30:02,733 --> 01:30:08,474
One side of the phone call, while the other is just a
tone, you know how many?

637
01:30:08,626 --> 01:30:16,098
Many. </ p >

638
01:30:16,184 --> 01:30:23,803
What's happening?

639
01:30:23,889 --> 01:30:26,696
It seems to me that you really wanted to have.

640
01:30:53,937 --> 01:30:56,088
I can not go back. They do not want me
. They do not want me. </ P> I did many bad things, they do not want
. </ P> Of course it was to come.
Course they want her back.

641
01:31:10,057 --> 01:31:14,087
You do not understand.
They will not want me back now.

642
01:31:17,077 --> 01:31:23,499
Eu não posso voltar atrás. Eles não
me querem. Eles não me querem mais.

643
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:30,431
Eu fiz muitas coisas más,
eles não me querem.

644
01:31:30,517 --> 01:31:36,532
Claro que devia voltar.
Claro que eles a querem de volta.

645
01:31:36,618 --> 01:31:42,895
Você não entende.
Eles não vão querer-me de volta agora.

646
01:31:51,585 --> 01:31:55,984
Leslie, it's time for you to go home.

647
01:34:39,578 --> 01:34:43,303
You're really here.

648
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:50,015
Leslie, there is something you must know, we...</ p >

649
01:34:50,118 --> 01:34:54,893
... His mother and I want to tell you something. </ P> You have a brother and a sister. </ P> - What do you mean?
- Well, after you...

650
01:34:54,979 --> 01:35:00,283
... we had two more children.

651
01:35:00,637 --> 01:35:05,343
- Where are they?
- are with friends, we wanted to see you first.

652
01:35:06,689 --> 01:35:10,455
- They knew I existed?
- Claro. Of course. </ P> - What they said?
- We told them that...

653
01:35:16,678 --> 01:35:24,147
who had a beautiful sister who
old enjoyed it.

654
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:29,744
And that was in heaven.

655
01:35:31,798 --> 01:35:36,937
That's what you thought?
They thought I was dead

656
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:43,692
que tinham uma bela irmã mais
velha de quem gostamos muito.

657
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:50,091
E que estava no céu.

658
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:56,953
Era isso que vocês achavam?
Pensavam que eu estava morta?

659
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:03,222
No. No! No! We never lost hope
. Never! Never

660
01:36:08,854 --> 01:36:11,911
Leslie...

661
01:36:15,988 --> 01:36:19,379
I want you back home. </ P> - This is Dylan.
- This is Gracie.

662
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:42,814
This is your sister.

663
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,921
- Hi
- Tu turns up the sky

664
01:36:47,007 --> 01:36:52,073
- No.
- So turns where you

665
01:36:54,655 --> 01:37:00,009
I was in a forest.

666
01:37:04,329 --> 01:37:07,481
- What forest?
- was far from here.

667
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:13,246
What were you doing there

668
01:37:13,332 --> 01:37:17,006
I was lost.

669
01:37:19,237 --> 01:37:22,243
- You were afraid?
- Sometimes.

670
01:37:22,329 --> 01:37:26,818
Why?

671
01:37:26,904 --> 01:37:29,869
Why were monsters in the forest.

672
01:37:34,861 --> 01:37:39,392
Why do not we all
to the dining room,

673
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:42,410

cake, made specially for her , ok

674
01:37:42,496 --> 01:37:49,279
então a mãe vai mostrar à Leslie o grande
bolo, feito especialmente para ela, ok?

675
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:02,689
of "Jamin", mom said it's your favorite.

676
01:38:25,709 --> 01:38:28,589
Since the catches you?
With your hand, you got it

677
01:38:28,675 --> 01:38:32,451
Great.
is colored. Look. </ P> You always fear? </ P> To make this kind of stuff

678
01:40:36,437 --> 01:40:39,518
You only need to have
someone to look after you , is everything.

679
01:40:40,711 --> 01:40:44,158
<i> And this is our
jungle and no one can enter here. </ i>

680
01:40:45,514 --> 01:40:50,266
<i> "Volta," she whispered .
"Tour, because I love you." </ i>
