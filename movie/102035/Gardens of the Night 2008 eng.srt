00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,739
We should make secret
names for each other.

507
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,839
I could be Mowgli,
and you could be Wolf.

508
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,129
DONNIE:
And who are they?

509
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,390
LESLIE:
They are the monkey people.

510
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,109
And Mowgli's lost in
the jungle, and Wolf

511
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,099
has to find me and protect me
from the evil, crazy monkeys.

512
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,470
And this is our jungle, and
nobody can come into it.

513
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,879
I had a birthday party once.

514
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,269
It was at the old woman's.

515
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,329
She made me a cake...
A chocolate cake.

516
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,430
It had five candles on it.

517
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,009
Why'd you run away from home?

518
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,389
My Mom went crazy.

519
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,970
She said she wanted to
stuff dogs in a library.

520
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,639
What about your Dad?

521
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,890
He lives in a van somewhere.

522
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,339
Where's your Mom?

523
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,799
They put her in a hospital.

524
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,490
Is that why she sold you?

525
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,639
Do you have any pictures like that?

526
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,909
Uh... I don't.

527
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,609
It's OK.

528
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,529
I could take some.

529
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,419
Then they go in the book.

530
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,449
The book gets sent all over the country.

531
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,189
I send it by Fed Ex.

532
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,259
If they get picked, they're
gonna be flown to the client,

533
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,409
or sometimes the client flies to you.

534
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,359
If the kids fly, I go with them.

535
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,389
I arrange the ID.

536
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,399
And the split is an even 50-50.

537
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,939
It's profitable and safe.

538
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,639
Safe?

539
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,649
That's good.

540
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,469
It's important.

541
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,539
Yeah.

542
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,240
Yeah.

543
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,419

You know where you're going?

That's a good man.

571
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,419
Judges are fair.

They always do the right thing.

So whatever he wants, you do.

They have no laws.

but use the stolen words they

They have no memories.

They boast and chatter and pretend

they are great people about to
do great things in the jungle.

He ran off to do an errand for me,

LESLIE (VOICE-OVER):
The next thing...

753

Mowgli remembered was feeling
hands on his arms and legs

754
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:33,369
and then a swatch of
branches in his face.

755
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,299
And then he was staring down
through the strange tree limbs

756
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,939
as the monkey people howled with triumph

757
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,890
and scuffled him away
to the other branches.
