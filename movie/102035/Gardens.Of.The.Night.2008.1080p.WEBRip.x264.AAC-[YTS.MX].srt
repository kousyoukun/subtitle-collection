we stayed up all night playing

371
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,553
games, and he read to me.

372
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:11,725
And I remember thinking, this is
the greatest night of my life.

373
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:16,021
And then he said, I have to
go buy a pack of cigarettes.

374
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,606
But don't worry, because
I'll be right back.

375
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:29,492
But he never came back, and
I never saw my daddy again.

376
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:32,829
So I know how you feel, honey.

377
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:36,583
I know I could never be your
daddy or be anything like him

378
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:42,839
or take his place, but I
could be like an uncle.

379
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:43,881
Uncle Alex?

380
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,515
[moaning]

381
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,563
OK.

382
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,814
Get some rest.

383
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,820
[moaning]

384
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,952
[door slamming]

385
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,538
[door locking]

386
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,756
FRANK: Are you crying?

387
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,800
No.

388
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,468
Good.

389
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,553
You can't cry.

390
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,822
Nobody likes little
girls who cry.

391
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,641
It makes you look like shit.

392
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,083
So your Alex's
little girl now, huh?

393
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,481
Alex's favorite little girl?

394
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:47,529
And you are my
favorite little boy.

395
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,655
Just drive the car.

396
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,591
[knocking on door]

397
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,804
[chatter on tv]

398
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,848
ALEX: Leslie, this is Orlando.

399
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,725
He's a good friend of ours.

400
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,561
He's gonna look after
you for a while, OK?

401
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:20,922
I want you to do
whatever he asks.

402
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,066
OK?

403
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,317
She understands.

404
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,569
FRANK: Don't worry about it.

405
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,029
She's fine.

406
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,779
All right.

407
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,656
Go and sit on the bed.

408
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:38,288
All we gonna do is have
a little fun, Leslie.

409
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,748
Could be fun for you, too.

410
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:52,302
Hey, you ever clean
your daddy's shoes,

411
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,384
each one you get a dollar?

412
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,640
Don't you do nothing like that?

413
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,686
Mow the lawn?

414
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,729
Clean the car?

415
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,985
I guess that's what little
boys do, mow the lawn

416
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,027
and clean the car.

417
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:20,747
You see, if you work at
something, it pays off.

418
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:30,757
If you work like you're supposed
to, like you would at school.

419
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,968
Only instead of good
grades, you get money.

420
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,557
And you pull in enough
money, you ain't

421
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,679
got to live on the streets.

422
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,897
And you don't want to do that.

423
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,733
The streets is where
the devils live.

424
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,694
[pouring drink]

425
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,696
The streets, you'll
get lost forever.

426
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:15,969
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

427
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,012
Are you scared?

428
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,978
You know what we're
gonna do is OK.

429
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,730
It's beautiful.

430
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,819
Is it me?

431
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:38,742
Is it the color of my skin?

432
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,052
That ain't nothing
to be frightened of.

433
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,703
Feels just the same as yours.

434
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,709
You want to touch it?

435
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,175
Nothing wrong with that, either.

436
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,261
Did you know that?

437
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,680
I bet that's been kept
a secret from you.

438
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,724
I bet you everybody
knows except for you.

439
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,188
Nothing wrong with touching.

440
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,229
Everybody does it.

441
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,113
Teacher does it.

442
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,239
Doctors do it.

443
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,201
The police officers do it.

444
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:24,913
Everybody does it.

445
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,999
Even your daddy does it.

446
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,835
Your daddy touches people.

447
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:35,298
And if you had stayed
home, pretty soon

448
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,217
he'd have been touching you.

449
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,218
No.

450
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,469
- What?
- No.

451
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,221
Hey.
Where are you going?

452
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,222
Get over here.

453
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,223
[muffled cry]

454
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,225
Just settle...

455
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,226
[crying loudly]

456
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,143
What's wrong?

457
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,144
Sit down there.

458
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,813
Shut up!

459
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:50,855
[crying loudly]

460
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:51,856
You hear me talking to you?

461
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,733
I'm trying to be
nice to you bitch.

462
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,151
[door opening]

463
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,152
ALEX: (SHOUTING) What the
fuck are you doing to her?

464
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:57,070
ORLANDO: Lie down.

465
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,154
Just stay down.

466
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,156
[grunting]

467
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,117
Motherfucker!

468
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,120
[gunshots]

469
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,746
[panting]

470
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:07,706
ALEX: Honey.

471
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:08,748
It's OK.

472
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,708
It's OK, baby.

473
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,084
[crying]

474
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,126
It's all right.

475
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,214
FRANK: Alex!

476
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,316
What the fuck happened?
ALEX: Get in.

477
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,258
Get in.
Go, go, go.

478
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,217
Go, go.

479
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,761
Go, go, go!

480
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,179
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

481
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:23,888
Christ, Alex!

482
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,057
For fuck's sake!

483
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,060
Now, didn't I tell you I'd
always be there to protect you?

484
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,645
Huh?

485
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,107
And nothing's ever gonna happen
to you because I won't let it.

486
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,233
FRANK: Hey.

487
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,735
This is murder, man.

488
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,111
This is fucking murder.

489
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,904
We're all involved in
this, all three of us.

490
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,824
It's OK, Frank,
because no one saw us.

491
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,051
All we gotta do
is stick together

492
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,745
and support each other.

493
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,455
[crickets chirping]

494
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,330
Shit.

495
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,290
Fucking cocksucker.

496
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,331
Fuck!

497
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,129
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

498
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,274
ALEX: You know, Leslie, we
all are a part of something

499
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:01,134
really terrible now.

500
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:07,140
But if we help each other,
and we stand by each other,

501
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,684
then everything's gonna be OK.

502
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,020
You understand?

503
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,247
Because I'm not
gonna tell anybody,

504
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:16,107
and you're not gonna
tell anybody, are ya?

505
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,152
No.

506
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,194
Don't worry.

00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:31,956

LESLIE: Why did
they leave me here?

510
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,186
I hate them.

511
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,229
I hate them!

512
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,861
Leslie?

513
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,989
[crying softly]

[light bulb buzzing]

517
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:09,095
It's OK, honey.

518
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,138
Shh.

519
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,307
That's the old you, honey.

520
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,933
You're just leaving it behind.

521
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,268
That's all.

522
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,269
Honey.

523
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,896
Shh.

524
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,066
It's just like the caterpillar.

525
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:24,444
He has shed his skin to become
the beautiful butterfly.

526
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,196
Shh.

527
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,990
And you don't think that
hurts the caterpillar?

528
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,118
Of course it does, honey.

529
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,206
But it's the only way he can
become a beautiful butterfly.

530
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:40,168
And that's what you're
becoming, something really,

531
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,338
really beautiful, honey.

532
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,051
Leslie, I think
you're beautiful.

533
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:52,722
Leslie, I would never hurt you.

534
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:56,142
I would never hurt you, honey.

535
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,102
Shh.

536
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,312
It's OK, honey.

537
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,439
It's OK now.

538
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,149
It's OK.

539
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,401
Shh.

540
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,528
You've got me.

541
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,488
You got me, honey.

542
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,451
It's all right.

543
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,370
I'm so proud of you.

544
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,088
Something is coming uphill, said

545
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,298
Mother Wolf, twitching one ear.

546
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,508
Get ready.

547
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,094
The bushes rustle a
little in the thicket,

548
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,972
and Father Wolf dropped,
ready for his leap.

549
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:37,308
Man, he snapped, a man's cub.

550
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,643
Look!

551
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:42,313
Directly in front of him,
holding a low branch,

552
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:47,277
sit a naked brown baby
who could just walk,

553
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:51,322
as soft and as dimpled

555
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,121
He looked up into Father
Wolf's face, and laughed.

556
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,832
Is that a man's cub,
said Mother Wolf.

557

I've never seen one before.

558
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,502
Bring it here.

559
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:10,342
How little, how naked, and how
bold, said Mother Wolf softly.

560
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:13,803
The baby was pushing
his way between the cubs

561
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:16,139

He's taking his meal
with the others.

He looks like a frog,
said Father Wolf.

564

Then that's what we'll call him.

the jungle, and Wolf

has to find me and protect me
from the evil, crazy monkeys.

574
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,232
And this is our jungle.

It was at the old woman's.

Why'd you run away from home?

My mom went crazy.

I send it by FedEx.

gonna be flown to the client,

client flies to you.

If the kids fly, I go with them.

I arrange the ID.

Hey, can I interest
you in a bar?

Why the fuck do you hang
out with him for, huh?

Has he got the guide

I don't think so.

1001

how I'm gonna help her,

01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:36,126
It's like you can't
even admit to yourself

1455
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:39,587
that your parents aren't dead.

1456
01:29:39,629 --> 01:29:41,589
Right.

1457
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:44,384
Why can't you
admit that, Leslie?

1458
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:45,706
They just fucking
didn't want me.

1459

never came back to get me.

And I fucking...

1461
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:55,145
I heard them on the phone,
and they kept saying soon,

1462
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:56,186
and then they never came.

1463
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:04,446
Well, I would imagine you heard

1464
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:08,491
one side of a conversation.

1465

kids I've had in here

1466
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:16,082

end of a telephone conversation?

1467
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:20,920
One side of a call, where the
other side is only a dial tone?

1468

something that you have to know.

We, um... oh, your
mother and I wanted

1495
01:34:50,982 --> 01:34:54,694
to be the ones to tell you.

1496
01:34:54,736 --> 01:34:57,739
You have a brother and a sister.

1497
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:01,701
What do you mean?

1498
01:35:01,743 --> 01:35:03,119
Well, after you, um...

1499
01:35:06,122 --> 01:35:07,999
we... we had two more children.

Where are they?

They're, um...
they're at a friend's.

We wanted to see you first.

1503

Do they know about me?

1504
01:35:25,266 --> 01:35:26,685
Of course.

1505

Of course they do.

1506
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:28,644
They do.

1507
01:35:31,773 --> 01:35:33,566
Well, what'd you tell them?

1508
01:35:33,608 --> 01:35:36,903
We told them that, um, that they

1509
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:44,945
had a beautiful older sister
who we love very much,

1510
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:47,122

You thought I died?

No.

No, we never stopped hoping.

No.

Where did you come back from?

1525
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:06,951
I was in a forest.

1526
01:37:06,993 --> 01:37:07,993
What forest?

1527
01:37:10,372 --> 01:37:12,874

Sometimes.

1532
01:37:26,096 --> 01:37:27,096
Why?

1533
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:39,150
Because there were
monsters in the forest.

Taylor, why don't we
