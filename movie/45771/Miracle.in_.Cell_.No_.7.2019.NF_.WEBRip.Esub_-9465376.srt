7

<i>The death penalty is now abolished.</i>

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,708

9

10

<i>From now on,</i>

<i>The European Union especially</i>

12
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:41,500

Ova Koyuncu.

APRIL 22, 1983

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,208
Well done, Ova.

22
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,333
-Lingo lingo!
-Bottles!

23
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,125
-Lingo lingo!
-Bottles!

24
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:30,208
Dad, look. I won a ribbon.

25
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,250
It's red, Ova!

26
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,375
Yes it is!

27
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,208
Look at the idiot! Retards.

28
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,042
Crazy! Crazy!

29
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,750
-Look, look.
-Children.

30
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,708
Children!

31
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,208
Shame on you.

32
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,292
We're sorry, teacher.

33
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,000
Good. Go on.

34
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,458
Teacher!

35
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,417
Idiot!

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,333
Come on.

37
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,375
Ova, look at the birds.

38
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,500
-Dad, stop. You can't catch them.
-Ova, but birds!

39
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:08,875
Birds!

40
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,333
Say hello to my Ayşe for me, birds!

41
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,875
Birds! Tell them we are fine!

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,292
Kemal, keeping on trimming?

43
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,750
A Heidi backpack!

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,708
Heidi backpack!

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,958
What's up, Memo?

46
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,125
How's it going, girl? How's school?

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,875
-How much for this backpack?
-400.

48
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,583
It's very expensive.

49
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,792
Give me what you have.
We can take care of the rest later.

50
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,708
No, no.

51
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,083
-Take it, boy.
-No, Grandma will be mad.

52
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,583
-My goodness!
-Come on.

53
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,167
We can't buy it, right?
It's too expensive.

54
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm going to sell candy apple
tomorrow at the parade.

55
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,292
Then we'll buy it, just like that!

56
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,125
Always the same.

57
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,958
This can't go on, Rıza!

58
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,000
You have to do what everyone else does.

59
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,875
I'll tell Grandma, I swear.

60
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,167
Look at Hasan.

61
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,375
Allow him, you aren't--

62
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,333
Come here.

63
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:17,792
Come here.

64
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,542
Nana.

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
What's wrong with my dad?

66
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,250
What's wrong with him?

67
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,333
Is my dad crazy?

68
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,917
Mind your words!

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,667
Don't make me slap you.

70
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,208
But they say so.

71
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,417
Who says so?

72
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,292
The kids in school.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
You tell them,

74
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,875
''If you call my dad crazy again,

75
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,917
I'm going to tell Nana

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,417
and she's going to cut your tongues.''

77
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,917
I'll tell Nellie over there, I swear.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,833
Rıza.

79
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,625
But he's not like the other dads at all.

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,958
No, he's not.

81
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,708
He's not like anyone else at all.

82
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,875
Do you know why?

83
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:09,042
Because your father
is the same age as you.

84
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,792
My father is the same age as me.

85
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,708
All right, go.

86
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,833
Enough already.

87
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,167
Enough, go on.

88
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,667
All right, enough. Go.

89
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,750
Walk, come on.

90
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,667
Come here.

91
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,125
Walk! Come with me.

92
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,333
"Heidi

93
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,083
loves to

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,292
go to the meadow

95
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,375
with Peter

96
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,417
and the goats.

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
very much."

98
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,792
Dad.

99
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,250
Dad.

100
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,583
Heidi's mom and dad are dead.
Did you know that?

101
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,667
Yes, they became angels.

102
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,625
That's why her aunt looked after Heidi.

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,750
Then her aunt got a job in the big city.

104
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,667
Dad.

105
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,833
You won't die, right?

106
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,583
You won't go away like Mom.

107
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:24,708
Dad won't go, Ova.

108
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,875
I will always stay with you.

109
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:36,083
"They lived happily

110
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,083
like this,

111
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,167
until one day

112
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,125
Heidi's aunt

113
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:52,208
turned up."

114
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,542
It's too thin, Memo.

115
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,917
Add some more.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,375
Garnet, garnet.

117
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,667
Garnet, add some.

Nana!

119
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,208
Dad!

120
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,250
We're out here!

121
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,417
We made candy out of apples!

122
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,458
Come on, then.

123
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,542
Go wash up, then eat your bread.

124
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:35,292
She's been going on about
that Heidi backpack all night.

125
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,458
Neither of us had any sleep at all.

126
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,750
<i>Give me five coins</i>
<i>Give me five coins</i>

<i>-Give me five coins</i>
<i>-</i>Daddy will, once he sells these.

129
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,458
This is an anthem, Dad.
You don't know anything.

130
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,542
<i>Give me five coins</i>
<i>Give me five coins</i>

131
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,708
<i>-If you don't have it</i>
<i>-</i>Why did you say that?

132
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,667
Grandma always does too.
She says, ''Memoş doesn't know.''

133
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,667
-Why did you say that?
<i>-Give me five--</i>

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,167
-Why--
-Heidi backpack!

135
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,167
Heidi backpack!

136
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,542
Thank you!

137
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,292
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

Heidi backpack is gone!

171
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,875
Heidi backpack is gone!

172
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,875
-Thank you.
-Enjoy it.

173
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,542
But sir, 
we were going to buy that backpack.

174
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,208
We brought the money.

175
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll order another one, all right?

176
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,083
But we were going to buy that, here's 400.

177
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,042
What is this?

178
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,792
-Don't mind them, sir.
-Move.

179
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,000
They were interested in it for some time.

180
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,125
Leave it, son.

181
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,333
Memo, stop. Come back here.

182
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,042
Sir?

183
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,625
Here's the money, you take it.

184
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,208
-Step away.
-But, this...

185
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,667
This is the one Ova likes. It's Ova's.

186
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,750
Sir.

187
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,667
Dad!

188
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,583
Who are you to touch my daughter?

189
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,667
Don't, sir. He's a half-wit.

190
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,208
It's all right. Go back to your posts.

191
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:20,833
Mount vehicle.

192
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,625
Come on, daughter.

193
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,000
Lunatic! It's nothing.

194
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,333
Sheep, come here.

195
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,583
Where's the backpack?

196
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,958
There isn't one. It's gone.

197
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:49,958
Gone where?

198
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,542
Seda's father bought it for her.

199
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,750
Oh, dear!

200
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,458
Whatever.
Don't be so sad. It's just Heidi.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,583
That's not why I'm sad.

202
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:05,083
Seda's father hit Dad.

203
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,708
Memoş?

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,958
You're okay, right?

205
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,375
Huh?

206
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,875
You're fine, right?

207
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,083
Grandma.

208
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,583
Will Ova smile?

209
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,917
She will. She will.

210
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,208
Don't you feel small.

211
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,125
You're no different than any of them.

212
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,208
You have more, not less.

213
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,792
You have a beautiful heart, son.

214
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,125
Come on, get up.

215
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,583
Get up and herd the sheep.

216
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,125
Come on.

217
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:28,250
-It was a great idea to come here, right?
-Yes, sir.

218
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,042
-Are you hungry?
-Yes sir, real hungry.

219
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,042
Thank you for the invitation, sir.

220
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,542
Of course, Staff Sergeant.

221
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,083
-Fresh air is nice.
-Yes, sir.

222
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,625
Don't fan that much, you're going to
burn the meat. Slow down.

223
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, sir.

224
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,542
These young privates are like children.

225
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,875
They don't know anything.

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,625
Don't call grown men children, sir.

227
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,917
Those anarchists we called children
almost burned the country down.

228
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,458
-Seda!
-Brother!

229
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,375
Stop!

230
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,000
Stay with your mother, Rıza.

231
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,250
Blue!

232
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,208
There's blue on the crazy guy! Go!

233
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,792
Blue! Blue!

234
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,625
Crazy, crazy! You're really crazy!

235
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,208
Crazy, crazy! You're really crazy!

236
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,958
Brother! Enough, he's Ova's dad.

237
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,375
Heidi backpack!

238
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,167
-Kids, the meat is ready. Come here!
-Come on, Seda.

239
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,042
Do you like this backpack that much?

240
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,125
It's the Heidi backpack.

241
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,333
Seda's dad bought it for her.

242
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,167
Enough with the backgammon.
Dinner is served.

243
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,042
Come on, come on.

244
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,083
You can't catch me!

245
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,875
Look at my backpack!

246
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,625
Red backpack!

247
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,792
Come on. Run.

248
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,458
Heidi backpack!

249
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,417
You can't catch me.

250
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,417
Run.

251
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,500
Come on. Come here.

252
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,917
Look at my backpack.

253
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:25,625
Run.

254
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:31,625
Come on.

255
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,292
Come on, come here.

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,333
<i>Rotten apple, rotten apple</i>

257
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,792
Don't go. Stop. Grandma will be mad.

258
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,250
Grandma will be mad.
Don't go there. It's too high.

259
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,708
Grandma. Grandma will be mad!

260
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,500
Don't, don't.

261
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,167
All right, it's dinner time.

262
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,292
There you go.

263
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,917
Have some, daughter.

264
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,375
Son, where's your sister?

265
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,250
She's playing with the crazy guy.
I called her but she didn't come.

266
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,375
Aydın?

267
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,583
Can you check on her?

268
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,000
He said she's playing with the crazy guy.
Go check on her.

269
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,708
He got her. Memo got her. Memo got her.

270
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,792
Her heart?

271
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,292
Her heart?

272
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:12,083
Shh, shh, Ova.

273
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,083
Grandma.

274
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,167
Grandma, is she asleep?

275
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,458
Is she asleep or an angel, Grandma?

276
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,458
Grandma.

277
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:37,875
Her heart.

278
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,667
Her heart!

279
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,375
-Seda!
-Daughter!

280
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,917
Daughter!

281
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,417
Seda! Seda!

282
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,250
Daughter! Daughter!

283
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,500
She's asleep. She's asleep.

284
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,083
What have you done to her?

285
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,292
What have you done to her?

286
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,625
-What have you done to her?
-Memo didn't.

287
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,583
-Sir! Sir!
-Let me go!

288
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,458
-Don't do it, sir. Stop!
-Let me go!

289
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,542
What have you done to her?

290
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,917
Seda!

291
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,083
My daughter!

292
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,167
Don't do it, sir. Don't do it!

293
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,583
Sir!

294
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:33,708
No, stop!

295
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,958
Stop!

296
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
I have to go home. Grandma will be mad.

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,708
It's nighttime, I should go home.

298
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,042
I should go home.

299
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,208
Where are you going?

300
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,458
Son.

301
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,250
Mehmet Koyuncu.

302
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,417
Is Mehmet Koyuncu here?

303
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,417
Sign it!

304
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,375
Back, back.

305
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,875
The one-eyed giant saw it, then--

306
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,542
Press your thumb.

307
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,667
Press it.

308
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,583
-I didn't do it.
-Hey!

309
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,875
She-- She lost her grip.

310
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,083
She fell. Jumped, plop!

311
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,292
Shut up!

312
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,875
We got the confession, sir.

313
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:39,625
Stop!

314
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:40,750
Stop!

315
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:01,917
Soldier!

316
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,417
Yes, sir!

317
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,583
-The prisoner is being released. Eyes up!
-Yes, sir!

318
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,583
Commander.

319
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,625
Commander. Son.

320
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,542
-Yes, ma'am?
-Mehmet.

321
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,875
I want to see Mehmet Koyuncu.

322
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,583
-What's your relation?
-He's my grandson.

323
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:16,958
You can't see him.

324
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,083
-You shouldn't see him.
-Why? Why shouldn't I see him?

325
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,417
He drowned a little girl in the lake.

326
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,708
Mehmet?

327
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,875
-Mehmet wouldn't do such a thing.
-He did.

328
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,917
-There are witnesses.
-He wouldn't, son.

329
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,208
He has a daughter that he dotes upon.

330
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,292
He confessed, ma'am.

331
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,750
-No, he wouldn't.
-Go away.

332
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,125
-I'm busy. Go.
-Just let me speak with him.

333
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,583
He's like a child.

334
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,833
Only I can understand him.

335
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,333
Son, just let me speak to him.

336
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,000
Please, for the love of God.

337
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,583
Memoş!

338
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,583
Son!

339
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,333
Dad!

340
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,708
Mehmet!

341
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,083
Dad!

342
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,500
Dad!

343
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:05,333
-Dad!
-Ova!

344
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,625
-Dad!
-Ova!

345
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,417
-Move aside, girl.
-Open the gate.

346
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,958
-Dad! Dad!
-Ova, stop!

347
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,292
-Dad!
-Ova?

348
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,375
I want my dad!

349
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,708
-Ova!
-Dad!

350
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,625
Ova.

351
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,458
She's Memo's child.

352
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,000
Dad!

353
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,667
Dad!

354
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,125
I want to go to Daddy!

355
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:30,833
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Can I see my child?

356
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,208
You can't.

357
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,083
She shouldn't see you like this.

358
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,417
-Dad, don't go!
-Stop, dear.

359
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,583
Ova.

360
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,708
-Ova!
-Dad!

361
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,208
-Stop, Ova. Stop!
-Let my dad go!

362
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,917
Dad!

363
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,875
Stop. Don't go.

364
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,208
One-eyed giant.

365
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,500
-Let my dad go!
-Ova!

366
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,042
The one-eyed giant saw it, Ova!

367
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,167
The one-eyed giant saw it, Ova!

368
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,583
Dad?

369
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,708
What does this one look like?

370
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,375
A sheep.

371
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,042
And the one in the back?

372
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,917
Another sheep with smaller ears.

373
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,667
What about that rock?

374
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,625
Which one?

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,042
That one.

376
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,917
A one-eyed giant.

377
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,542
Yes, it's a one-eyed giant!

378
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,167
The one-eyed giant saw it.

379
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,667
What are you talking about?

380
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,333
The one-eyed giant saw it!

381
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,583
MUĞLA E-TYPE
CLOSED PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION

382
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,583
Dede Efendi, huh?

383
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,917
Never mind Dede Efendi,

384
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,500
even God himself can't
straighten this place out.

385
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,000
That's blasphemy, son.

386
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,958
You're talking like this now
because you're in prison,

387
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:59,042
what are you going to do
when you're in Hell?

388
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,250
My God!

389
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,167
Didn't you say on my first day here,

390
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,375
''God makes people he loves suffer here,
you will be all right in the next world''?

391
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,625
What happened to that?

392
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,792
That wasn't from the book.

393
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,833
Just something my late mom used to say.

394
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:15,833
I never saw my mom's kind of Islam
in any book, to tell you the truth.

395
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,708
''Mother is the Truth,

396
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,417
Have you learned this secret?''
says the song.

397
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:25,667
This is what I've read, Askorozlu.
What you say is <i>shirk.</i>

398
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,542
And this is what Neşet said, Hafiz.

399
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,042
Whatever it may be.

400
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,083
It's all about concentration.

401
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,875
-I don't remember asking.
-What happens when you concentrate?

402
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,417
Do these walls come down?

403
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,083
Concentrate on your own business.
No one's talking to you.

404
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,875
Just give me an answer, what happens?

405
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,042
He's still concentrating on me.

406
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,833
What is he doing in the open?

407
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,583
Askorozlu punished him
after his last suicide.

408
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,958
He has to look at other women
until he's free of heartache.

409
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,042
The girl he snatched got married.

410
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,583
It doesn't fucking work!

411
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,667
It doesn't work!

412
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,542
It doesn't work!

413
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,208
I can't fucking concentrate!

414
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,958
How can she do this to me?

415
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,792
How can she? How?

416
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:08,833
Cut it out!

417
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:10,375
Stop it!

418
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,458
Don't make Askorozlu lose his temper.

419
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,083
Warden, the new inmates are here.

420
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:45,083
Move. Stand in line. Over there.

421
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,333
Good afternoon, Faruk.

422
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,542
It's Captain, Warden.

423
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,208
These aren't bird shit.

424
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,667
There's special instruction
for one of the inmates.

425
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,083
Don't bother trying to take
him to interrogation.

426
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:05,750
The Gendarmerie can't just take people
anymore. Regulations have changed.

427
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,208
Read it.

428
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,125
Which one of you is Mehmet Koyuncu?

429
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,333
-Me, officer.
-This one!

430
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,667
Don't, don't.

431
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,583
Enough!

432
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,333
He is our responsibility now.

433
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,542
Captain.

434
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:37,750
So be it.

435
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:38,708
Warden.

436
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,417
If you make even one wrong move,

437
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,208
I will kill you myself.

438
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:07,375
Got it?

439
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,625
Can I go home?

440
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,750
Take him in.

441
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,875
-All of them. Come on.
-Come on!

442
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,667
-Come on.
-Go.

443
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,208
Inside.

444
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,417
Don't let others know what he did.

445
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,292
You're right. They would kill him.

446
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,250
Strip, boy!

447
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,750
Quickly!

448
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,833
I said strip!

449
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,375
Hello.

450
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,542
What are you doing here?

451
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,708
Cooking mushrooms. You?

452
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,625
One of my friends
fell down into the lake here.

453
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,042
I saw.

454
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,750
Did you, really?

455
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,750
Yes.

456
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,542
Did you see my dad too?

457
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,458
The shepherd?

458
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,833
They thought he did it.

459
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,500
Can I bring my nana?

460
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,042
Will you tell her too?

461
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes, I will.

462
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:00,958
Hooray!

463
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,833
Wait here, I'll be right back.

464
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,208
-Okay?
-Okay.

465
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,792
Would you like some bread and cheese?

466
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,500
Halt.

467
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,875
You come with me.

468
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:41,125
And you stay right here. Got it?

469
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,375
Don't you move an inch!

470
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,167
Why isn't he coming?

471
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,708
I'm going to give you your mattresses.

472
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,375
I can't deal with him right now.
You take both of them.

473
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:19,875
What's up?

474
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,542
What are you doing?

475
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,458
What do you want, boy?

476
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:33,250
Are you mad?

477
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:36,917
Askorozlu.

478
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Call Ali.

479
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,042
Is he staying here?

480
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,042
-Take your mattress.
-Ali.

481
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:44,958
Get in.

482
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,708
Get in.

483
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,833
Ali is the ward representative.

484
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,125
He will tell you the rules and such.

485
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,083
-May God save you.
-You go over there.

486
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,542
And you there.

487
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,583
-What did they do?
-I said go!

488
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,833
The tall one is a prisoner of fate.

489
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:07,292
The other one's not to be told.
Warden's orders.

490
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,167
Don't make me mad, now!

491
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,625
-Warden's orders, my ass. Tell me.
-He...

492
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,625
They beat him up pretty good.

493
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,542
What did he do?

494
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,875
He killed a little girl.

495
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,458
Come on, Nana. Here.

496
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:21,417
Where is he?

497
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,125
Where is he, dear?

498
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,833
He isn't here. He's gone.

499
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm scared!

500
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,958
-I'm scared. It's dark!
-Move aside.

501
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:55,042
It's dark!

502
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:58,792
I'm scared.

503
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:00,792
I'm scared.

504
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,625
You're scared, huh? Fuck you!

505
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,583
You fuck!

506
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:13,167
No, Nana. Let's wait a little longer.
Maybe he'll come back.

507
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,917
Come on, girl.

508
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,542
It's almost dark.

509
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,875
I'm not going.

510
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,458
I'm staying here!

511
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,500
Ova.

512
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,125
My child.

513
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,542
Are you sure
that it wasn't your imagination?

514
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,042
Yes, I'm sure it wasn't.

515
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,500
I really saw him.

516
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,708
He said that he would tell you.

517
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,583
Don't cry, sweetie.

518
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,083
Don't cry, my child.

519
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,042
Come on.

520
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:55,958
Come on.

521
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,625
How is he?

522
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,458
It's a miracle that he's still alive.
There are a lot of broken bones.

523
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,042
Let's keep him
in the infirmary for a while.

524
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay, it'd be better.

525
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,667
Do we know who did it?

526
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,375
How can we, Warden?

527
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,917
They found out what he did.

528
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,458
They won't let him live.

529
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,000
Captain Faruk.

530
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,833
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Aydın.</i>

531
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,125
Yes, sir.

532
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:47,083
I sent special instructions to you
regarding Mehmet Koyuncu.

533
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,167
<i>We're following it to the letter, sir.</i>

534
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,625
The Warden wrote a petition.

535
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:55,042
He asked him to be transferred
for his safety.

536
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,667
Sir, the inmates in the ward--

537
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,667
Shut up!

538
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:01,792
Would I send him there
if I wanted to kill him?

539
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,375
I will have him hanged,
make an example out of him.

540
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,625
Everyone will read in the newspaper

541
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,417
what happened to the man
who did this to my daughter.

542
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,708
That dog will not silently disappear!

543
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,542
Understood, Captain?

544
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,042
Understood, sir.

545
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:20,125
Sorry?

546
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,292
Yes, sir!

547
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:55,542
Skipper.

548
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,292
This is Cengiz.

549
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,167
He has a request.

550
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,042
No need.

551
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,167
May God save you.

552
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,083
Thank you, sir.

553
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,333
I'm listening.

554
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:07,833
I was going to say...

555
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,958
Be quick!

556
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,292
Sir, I play the <i>bağlama.</i>

557
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,792
They took my bağlama.

558
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,208
The guards didn't let it in.

559
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,792
Got it, all right.
I'll tell them to bring it here.

560
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,042
-Ali.
-Thank you, sir.

561
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,042
-Get up!
-Come on, get up!

562
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,125
-Get down from there!
-On your feet!

563
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,583
-Over there!
-Move!

564
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,667
-Get up!
-Form a line!

565
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,750
-Move!
-Get in line!

566
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,875
-Move over!
-Get in line!

567
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,500
-What the hell is this?
-Move!

568
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,417
-What is this?
-What are these?

569
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,375
What are these?

570
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,458
Good evening, gentlemen.

571
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,458
What did you do?

572
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,542
Huh?

573
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,083
Did you think that you were
bringing the child killer to justice?

574
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,917
Her father is a Lieutenant Colonel!

575
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,458
Lieutenant Colonel!

576
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,958
He's God, as far as you're concerned.

577
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,792
You will not touch him!

578
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,083
You will not touch him!

579
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,333
He'll be on the end of a rope
when the time comes.

580
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,292
We will punish him, not you!

581
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,458
Do you fucking get it?

582
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,125
Anyone touches a hair on him,

583
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,208
and he will never see
the light of day again.

584
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,208
10 DAYS LATER

585
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,000
MUĞLA E-TYPE
CLOSED PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION

586
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,083
INFIRMARY

587
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,333
Can I speak?

588
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,417
Don't mind me asking, but...

589
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,625
What are you staring at like that?

590
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:04,750
Nothing.

591
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,458
Here you are, Uncle Yusuf.

592
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,208
Here you go, Skipper.

593
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:10,667
So, Selim...

594
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,125
It's warmer now, why are you still here?

595
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,292
My hand slipped this time, Skipper.

596
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,333
I missed a little,
so the judge missed a little too.

597
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,542
My release is postponed
to the end of July.

598
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:24,292
But God willing,
I'll be back here next winter.

599
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,375
He's like a seasonal worker.

600
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,500
It's a sin.

601
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,250
How can you stab someone

602
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,542
just so that you aren't
on the street in the winter?

603
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,875
You don't know how cold it is in our town.

604
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,292
Piss off, you heretic.

605
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:39,625
Tevfik.

606
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,458
Are you feeling better?

607
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,625
I'm fine, Hafız. Thank you.

608
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,917
Why do you do this, son?

609
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,750
You're so young.

610
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,125
What happens to those who
try killing themselves?

611
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,625
Do you know?

612
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,208
Nisa surah states that,

613
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,750
''Don't kill yourselves.

614
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,542
Those who take their own life

615
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:14,042
will suffer greatly and severely
in the afterlife.

616
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,292
And remain in Hell forever.''

617
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:19,958
God speaks the truth.

618
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:21,625
Yes, brother.

619
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,250
Skipper, what should we do with him?

620
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,000
Do whatever you want, just don't kill him.

621
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,333
Put him with Selim, he can help him.

622
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,792
-Selim!
-Yes, brother?

623
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,333
For the love of God!

624
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,625
Fuck off! I'll rip your arms off!

625
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,667
It's okay, Skipper.

626
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,333
For the love of God!

627
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,292
Take him.

628
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,458
-He's with you now.
-All right.

629
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,417
Walk.

630
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,292
-What was I--
-Have some.

631
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,208
-Thank you.
-My visitor brought them.

632
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,000
You have some too.

633
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,333
Time...

634
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,375
heals all, Tevfik.

635
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,083
What's in this?

636
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,958
There's cognac in them, Hafız.

637
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,208
God damn you! Fuck off, heretic!

638
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,833
Birds!

639
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,583
-Look at him. 
-What's he doing?

640
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:31,667
Fuck off!

641
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,833
Lunatic!

642
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,250
He's going to get himself killed. Maniac.

643
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,583
Come, come. Fly.

644
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:46,792
He's crazy.

645
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,208
Its heart is beating.

646
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,667
Can you do a flip?

647
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,208
Like flap, flap.

648
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:12,917
Do you have any children?

649
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,083
I have. Ova.

650
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,458
Memo's child, Ova.

651
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,167
I miss Ova very much.

652
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:23,875
Say hi to her.

653
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,167
Say hi to my Ayşe too.

654
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:28,500
Come on, fly, fly.

655
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
What are you doing?

656
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,375
Writing a letter, can't you see?

657
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,458
-Let me see.
-Hey!

658
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,583
Here.

659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,500
<i>Peace be with you, Ova.</i>

660
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:15,708
<i>I miss you very much.</i>

661
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,833
<i>How are you, good?</i>

662
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:20,542
<i>How's Grandma?</i>

663
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,250
<i>Dad is fine.</i>

664
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,542
<i>This place is really nice.</i>

665
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,958
<i>Your dad made a lot of friends.</i>

666
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,667
<i>They all treat Dad very nice.</i>

667
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,792
<i>Askorozlu is my best friend here.</i>

668
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,167
<i>He said ''Keep Memo alive.''</i>

669
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,125
<i>There's Teacher Selim.</i>

670
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,292
<i>I cook.</i>

671
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,292
<i>I do laundry.</i>

672
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:43,292
<i>The day dawned</i>

673
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,333
<i>We all woke up and rallied to the trenches</i>

674
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,875
<i>The day dawned</i>

675
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,542
<i>We all woke up and rallied to the trenches</i>

676
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,583
<i>They sing songs here.</i>

677
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,125
<i>They get mad at me</i>
<i>because I don't know them.</i>

678
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,500
<i>But I want to sing too.</i>

679
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,500
<i>How's Rıza? Is he still naughty?</i>

680
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,417
<i>I miss you very much.</i>

681
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:21,917
Ova!

682
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:24,833
Ova!

683
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,542
Ova!

684
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,000
Ova!

685
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,083
Ova!

686
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,833
Don't close it, Ova can't hear!

687
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,542
Guard!

688
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:45,125
She's there, Teacher.
Just like I told you.

689
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,708
Ova.

690
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:50,125
Tell your teacher why you skipped school.

691
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,625
Ova.

692
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,333
Why do you do this?

693
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:58,125
In case that man comes again.

694
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,333
I'm tired of this, Mine. I'm tired.

695
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,375
Nana doesn't believe me anymore.

696
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,708
No, she does.

697
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:08,333
Would she ask everybody
with you if she didn't?

698
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,917
But you don't believe me
anymore too, Teacher.

699
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,167
Ova.

700
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,500
If you come to the school
every single day,

701
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,167
I'll take you to see your dad.

702
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:29,417
-They don't let us see him.
-They will.

703
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:32,083
This time, they will. You know why?

704
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:36,083
Because we'll write a petition
with a lawyer and get a permit.

705
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,208
<i>The court has reached a decision.</i>

706
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,542
<i>According to witness testimony</i>

707
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:54,375
and the evidence gathered,

708
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,958
it is decided that

709
00:47:57,042 --> 00:48:01,917

712
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,625

MUĞLA E-TYPE
CLOSED PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION

716
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,042
-Inmate's name?
-Mehmet Koyuncu.

717
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:07,792
He can't have visitors.

718
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:10,292
Come here.

719
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:13,625
Come on.

720
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,958
You wait, Fatma.

721
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,167
We have a permit.
Warden Nail was informed as well.

722
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,542
Captain has specific orders.

723
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,500
Call me someone in charge, please.

724
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,000
The military is in charge.

725
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:37,167
-If Captain's not here, you can't see him.
-Call the Captain, then.

726
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,250
The Warden, your commander, whoever.

727
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,500
They are his family,
they have a right to visit.

728
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,250
-Got it?
-Hang on a second.

729
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,250
-What is this?
-Who are you?

730
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,583
I'm Warden Nail. Yes?

731
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,875
I'm Teacher Mine, we spoke on the phone.

732
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,375
-About Mehmet Koyuncu's family.
-Yes, I remember.

733
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,083
His grandma and daughter are here.

734
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:00,333
Memo has a daughter?

735
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,250
Ova.

736
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:03,917
Ova?

737
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,125
Ova is gone!

738
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:10,375
Dad! Dad!

739
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,542
Dad!

740
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,208
Dad!

741
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:26,792
Dad!

742

Lingo lingo!

00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,833
Lingo lingo!

747
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,375
Dad!

748
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,542
Lingo lingo!

749
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:28,458
Bottles?

750
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:29,583
Lingo lingo!

751
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,750

Bottles!

754
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,458
Ova! Ova!

755
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,292
Is Ova here? Ova!

756
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,333
Dad!

757
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:56,958
Ova!

758
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,625
Dad, where are you?

759
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,250
I'm here, Ova!

760
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,417
Dad, I've found you!

761
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,292
And I've found you, Ova!

762
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,042
And I've found you!

763
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,500
Dad, they're not letting us in!

764
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,417
Why, why?

765
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,542
Someone saw it, Dad!

766
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,000
The one-eyed giant saw it!

767
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:25,083
He saw it! The one-eyed giant saw it!

768
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,542
I found him, Dad.
I found the one-eyed giant!

769
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,792
Ova!

770
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,125
Ova! There are tumbler birds here!

771
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,667
-Dad!
-Ova!

772
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,375
-There she is! Get her!
-Dad!

773
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,375
Dad!

774
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:39,292
-Dad!
-Ova!

775
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,667
-Let me go!
-Ova! Let her go!

776
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:44,375
Let her go! Let her go!

777
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:47,208
-Memo, all right. Calm down!
-Let her go!

778
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,292
-Memo, get away from there!
-Hey!

779
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,750
She's my daughter!

780
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,958
-What's going on here?
-She's my daughter!

781
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:55,208
Stop, let him go!

782
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,875
He's not trying to escape!

783
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,542
Brother, brother!

784
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:03,042
Let him go, brother!

785
00:53:04,042 --> 00:53:06,042
-Memo!
-What's going on?

786
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,125
-Stop!
-It's okay.

787
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:09,333
-Take him inside!
-Help me!

788
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,625
Askorozlu, help me!

789
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,375
-Help me, help me!
-Take him away!

790
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,083
-Let me go!
-Let her go!

791
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:23,375
Get away, don't touch her!
Let her go!

792
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,292
It's okay.

793
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,333
It's all right.

794
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:28,125
Come on, let's go.

795
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,292
Shame on you.

796
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,125
Shame on you!

797
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:27,500
Ali!

798
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:44,042
Thank you, brother.

799
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:47,208
So, they made up their mind, huh?
They're going to hang him.

800
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,417
The dead girl is the Commander's daughter.

801
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,667
Nobody can save him.

802
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,125
Never mind all that.

803
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,875
This man is crazy.

804
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:01,292
He shouldn't even be in here,
let alone be executed.

805
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,667
I asked Şeref.

806
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,167
He said that
the health board cleared him, but...

807
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
Cleared him?

808
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
He has a brain the size of a pea!

809
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:20,125
Maybe they made him the scapegoat
for someone else's crime?

810
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:21,458
It's possible.

811
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,167
Damn it.

812
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:28,125
He should be able to see
his child before he dies.

813
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,375
Where's my mom, Nana?

814
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,417
She's an angel now, I told you.

815
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,750
She went to Heaven.

816
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:51,083
When do you go to Heaven?

817
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:57,375
You go whenever the man upstairs
calls you, my child.

818
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,167
Who's the man upstairs?

819
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:00,583
God, my dear.

820
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,708
Will you go to Heaven too?

821
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,417
I hope so.

822
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Only God knows that.

823
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,208
So...

824
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,917
If you go to Heaven,
who's going to take care of me?

825
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,833
Don't worry, Ova.
I'm going to be here until you grow up.

826
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,083
I won't leave you.

827
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:32,250
Go to sleep now.

828
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:40,417
How many days until Dad comes back, Nana?

829
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,000
Not many.

830
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:50,125
I don't know exactly, but not many.

831
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,042
Go to sleep already.

832
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:54,542
Come on.

833
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,000
I am going to...

834
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,542
tell you two things, Ova.

835
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:35,583
The first one is about the truth.

836
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,083
Get your <i>bağlama, </i>Cengiz.

837
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:44,375
All right, brother.

838
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:47,583
Take these, give them to Askorozlu.

839
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:48,500
Go.

840
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:53,250
Here you go.

841
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:55,000
Skipper.

842
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,125
-Skipper, let me have just one.
-No.

843
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,250
-Here you go, brother.
-Thanks, brother.

844
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,417
Here you go.

845
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,375
-Come, sit down.
-Enjoy.

846
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:05,750
Come on.

847
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,208
Put it down, boy.

848
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:34,292
<i>Passenger, born of a mother</i>

849
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,500
<i>Passenger, born of a mother</i>

850
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:42,583
<i>Did you love this world</i>
<i>when you laid eyes on it?</i>

851
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:46,667
<i>Did you love this world</i>
<i>when you laid eyes on it?</i>

852
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:58,708
<i>Some are big,</i>
<i>some are bugs, some are slaves</i>

853
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:02,542
<i>Some are big,</i>
<i>some are bugs, some are slaves</i>

854
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:06,417
<i>Have you ever wondered and asked why?</i>

855
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:10,958
<i>Have you ever wondered why is it so?</i>

856
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:17,917
So? Doesn't she have anyone else?

857
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,667
-There's Grandma.
-It's better than nothing.

858
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,583
Her mother?

859
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,000
My Ayşe became an angel.

860
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:25,083
When Ova was a baby.

861
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,417
God rest her soul.

862
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,708
Ova doesn't remember it, but I do.

863
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:32,875
Look at him laugh.

864
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:34,958
Was it love at first sight?

865
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:38,875
I don't get it.

866
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,500
Skipper asked how it happened.

867
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:43,167
Did you see her at the bazaar
or at the market?

868
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,042
Or did she see you first and liked you?

869
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,333
You're quite the catch!

870
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,583
-I got it.
-You didn't get shit!

871
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:57,125
Where did she see you,
how did it happen? Tell us.

872
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,333
I saw her at home.

873
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,417
Grandma. Grandma took me.

874
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,292
Said, ''You are getting married.''

875
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:07,792
Ayşe looked at me, and smiled.

876
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,417
Then I smiled at her.

877
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:13,125
Imam came and married us.

878
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:15,125
After that, we went home.

879
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,458
We got in the room...

880
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:20,667
Good God!

881
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:23,708
-This guy!
-My goodness!

882
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:25,167
Hey!

883
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,667
What about the wedding?

884
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,333
-There wasn't one.
-Why?

885
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,500
I don't know.

886
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:31,958
What do you know, Memo?

887
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,833
I don't know.

888
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:36,792
I'm not very smart.

889
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,167
-Grandma says so too.
-What does she say?

890
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,458
''Memoş doesn't know.''

891
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:41,750
Why does she say that?

892
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:44,625
So that they don't get mad!

893
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:53,458
<i>We're all passengers, we come and we go</i>

894
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:57,500
<i>We're all passengers, we come and we go</i>

895
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:01,375
<i>Is the world your country,</i>
<i>your homeland?</i>

896
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:08,250
<i>Is the world your country,</i>
<i>your homeland?</i>

897
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,042
-What a talent!
-Congratulations.

898
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,750
Thank you.

899
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,458
BLOOD IS CLEANED WITH WATER
NOT VENGEANCE

900
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,958
-Get over there.
-What are you doing?

901
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,458
-Get over there.
-Who the hell are you?

902
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,083
You don't know me, Askorozlu.

903
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,375
And I don't know you.

904
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,917
Hüseyin Ağa sent me. He sends his regards.

905
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:44,750
Hüseyin Ağa?

906
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,250
Hüseyin--

907
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:47,875
Memo, stop!

908
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,500
-Stop! Memo!
-Stop!

909
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,583
Stop! Memo!

910
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:52,667
Fuck!

911
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,750
Memo!

912
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:54,833
Get over here!

913
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:55,958
Get over here!

914
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:57,667
You got stabbed!

915
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,708
It hurts! It hurts!

916
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:00,833
It hurts, Askorozlu!

917
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:03,125
I'm going to fuck you up!

918
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,917
-No, it's a sin! It hurts!
-I'm going to fuck him up! Let me go!

919
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Askorozlu!

920
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,583
-What's going on?
-What happened?

921
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,583
It's okay. This asshole attacked me!

922
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:14,500
-Get up!
-Stand up!

923
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:15,917
It burns! It burns!

924
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,833
Hafız!

925
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,125
It's okay.

926
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,292
It's okay, Memo.

927
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:21,625
-It's a sin, don't do it!
-Are you okay?

928
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,042
You're unbelievable.

929
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:27,958
It's all right.

930
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:47,167
How did he get the knife inside?

931
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,208
He didn't.

932
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,417
We did.

933
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:54,167
He snuck it in the <i>bağlama, </i>the dog.

934
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:58,333
Thank God Memo came in time.

935
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,542
So, what do you say?

936
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,042
Are we doing this?

937
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,500
-Skipper, we'll dig our own graves.
-This is nonsense.

938
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:08,458
How can--

939
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:10,458
Which one of us is
as good of a father as him?

940
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:15,083
Who in this ward is
that aware of their fatherhood?

941
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:16,042
Tell me.

942
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,542
This is going to happen.

943
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,875
This is a debt of life now.

944
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,833
If they find out, we're done.

945
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,500
We'll never get out of here.

946
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:28,500
-That's what I'm saying, if they--
-God hears who praises Him.

947
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,542
Can you do this?

948
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,792
I'll be damned if I can't.

949
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,667
Welcome.

950
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,875
Thank you, Skipper.

951
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:51,958
I'm going to ask you
something important this time.

952
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:54,375
I'm listening.

953
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:01,167
You will sneak a child in here.

954
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,792
-Sorry?
-Psst!

955
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:06,583
A child.

956
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,208
So, what is it?

957
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:17,542
Askorozlu wanted a gun, we got it.

958
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:20,417
He wanted a rifle, we got it.
He wanted <i>rakı, </i>we got it.

959
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,750
Now a child?

960
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,167
He wanted a child?

961
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:24,250
For what?

962
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:26,000
She's going to see her dad.

963
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:27,750
Who's her dad?

964
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,750
He didn't say. He got pissed.

965
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,875
Think about it. Who can he be?

966
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:45,958
Come in.

967
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:47,792
Warden.

968
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,333
Order of execution.

969
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:54,583
Mehmet Koyuncu.

01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,667
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
DEATH SENTENCE NOTICE

971
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,208
-Here she comes.
-Okay.

972
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:21,250
Lingo lingo!

973
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:23,458
Bottles?

974
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:27,083
How do you know that?

975
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,583
Come here.

976
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:31,958
Your dad sent us.

977
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:35,250
We're going to take you to him.
But you can't tell anyone.

978
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,875
She knows him. I swear.

979
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:49,792
She got it from just a word.

980
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,917
She knows him, right?

981
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:53,958
She got it right away.

982
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,708
She has his eyes.

983
01:06:58,125 --> 01:06:59,875
No, I don't think so.

984
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,417
Don't make Hatice go crazy!

985
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,958
Are you mad at me?

986
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:05,875
No, my dear.

987
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,708
Why would I be mad at you?
You're innocent.

988
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:12,542
But my dad is innocent too.

989
01:07:13,792 --> 01:07:15,875
Of course, he's so innocent.

990
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:40,167
I WENT TO SEE DAD

991
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:01,667
There, dear.

992
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,583
Your father is over there.

993
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,167
But, you go by that door for now.

994
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,833
-Where's my dad?
-Over there. He's coming.

995
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:11,417
You can't see him here,
it has to be in there. Go.

996
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,958
Be quiet, okay? Go.

997
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:35,708
Welcome, Hatice.

998
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:45,208
I brought your child.

999
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:46,375
Don't worry.

1000
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,083
Thank you.

1001
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,458
Thank you.

1002
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,583
What gives?

1003
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,083
Something's wrong.

1004
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,500
What is it?

1005
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,375
I have something to say to you.

1006
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:04,542
Then I will get out of here.

1007
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,083
What happened?

1008
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,750
I was 17 years old.

1009
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,208
What did you tell me?

1010
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:14,625
Huh?

1011
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:16,000
That we'd run away.

1012
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,000
What did I do?

1013
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,083
My parents didn't approve.

1014
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:21,208
What did I do?

1015
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:22,958
I ran away, didn't I?

1016
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,542
What did you do?

1017
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:25,917
You stabbed someone.

1018
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,292
Where were you when
I gave birth to the first boy?

1019
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:32,083
You trashed Pepe's store
and smashed his head.

1020
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,000
Hands off!

1021
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:34,125
Off!

1022
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,542
What did you do
when the second boy was born?

1023
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:37,750
You cut someone again.

1024
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:40,000
What did you do
when your daughter was born?

1025
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:41,958
You shot someone.

1026
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,375
You told me
not to bring your daughter here

1027
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,042
so she wouldn't see you here.

1028
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:47,958
My daughter...

1029
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:50,500
Our daughter... Look at me!

1030
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,458
Look. Off!

1031
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:54,083
What did I say to all of this?

1032
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:55,875
I said okay, didn't I?

1033
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,458
What am I going to say now?

1034
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,417
I'm going to say no!

1035
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,500
I'm going to say no!

1036
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:01,917
-What are you--
-Let me go!

1037
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,958
Sit the hell down!

1038
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,458
What the hell are you talking about?

1039
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:08,083
You're going to say no to what?

1040
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,708
She's so cute, praise be!

1041
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,042
She has your eyes.

1042
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:16,708
Shame on you.

1043
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:19,083
Shame on you.

1044
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:20,000
Who?

1045
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:21,875
The girl?

1046
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,625
That girl is not mine.
What are you talking about?

1047
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:30,417
What are you talking about?
Don't make me yell.

1048
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,125
Gentlemen.

1049
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:39,958
Tea is on the house.

1050
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:14,667
Dad?

1051
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,000
Ova?

1052
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,083
Dad!

1053
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:32,125
Ova!

1054
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:35,792
-I missed you so much!
-Ova! Ova!

1055
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,417
Ova!

1056
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,083
I'm here, my dear Daddy!

1057
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:45,542
I'm here, Daddy, I'm here!

1058
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:51,625
Memo's child!

1059
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,750
Ova went to the one-eyed giant.

1060
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:04,083
There was someone there, she found him.

1061
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,667
He said that the girl fell.

1062
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,625
He said that Ova's dad is a good man.

1063
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,833
That he'd tell what he saw.

1064
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:11,083
He said he'd tell.

1065
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,208
I, Ova...

1066
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,042
went, la, la, la.

1067
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:16,042
I went, one eyed-giant there,

1068
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,125
She went ahead, stop, stop. She--

1069
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,417
What happened?

1070
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:21,500
Ouchie.

1071
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,667
But, here too.

1072
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,292
And here, and here.

1073
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:34,958
Welcome.

1074
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,583
Is your name Ova?

1075
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,375
What a beautiful name.

1076
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,375
Ova.

1077
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,875
Would you like this?

1078
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:47,292
You can have it.

1079
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,542
A present, Ova!

1080
01:13:50,917 --> 01:13:52,500
Teacher, present, teacher.

1081
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,542
Ova, come back. No, no.

1082
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,458
Look.

1083
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:04,083
I can't make those, Ova.

1084
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:07,083
I wrote you a letter, Ova.
Why didn't you reply?

1085
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:10,917
Are you looking at the tree?

1086
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:24,917
Ova!

1087
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:40,333
Ova!

1088
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:56,333
God save us!

1089
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,625
Where would she go?

1090
01:14:58,708 --> 01:14:59,750
Ova.

1091
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,083
My child.

1092
01:15:40,292 --> 01:15:41,208
Swords!

1093
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:42,417
Brother!

1094
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,583
Is she here?

1095
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,125
He's not my dad. You are.

1096
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,375
Memo's child.

1097
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,000
Whose child is she? I don't get it.

1098
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,792
I fried my brain laughing.

1099
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,500
Dad, is everyone here a bad man?

1100
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,208
Girl.

1101
01:16:00,583 --> 01:16:01,958
Is that so?

1102
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:02,875
No, no.

1103
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,375
Everyone here is my friend, Ova.

1104
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,000
My friend.

1105
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:09,000
Girl.

1106
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:12,917
I got you.

1107
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,417
Memo got Ova.

1108
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:17,042
You rascals!

1109
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,667
I can't find him.

1110
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,750
He doesn't come when I'm there.

1111
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:27,625
This witness can really save Memo.

1112
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,000
Well done, girl.

1113
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,625
You're so smart.

1114
01:16:32,792 --> 01:16:33,625
Smart Ova!

1115
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:35,750
It's time. We're going.

1116
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:36,667
Dad?

1117
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:37,917
Ova?

1118
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,833
Ova.

1119
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,250
Your dad is sick.

1120
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,458
Once he gets better, I'll send him to you.

1121
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,208
I'm staying with dad.

1122
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:47,625
And I'm staying with Ova.

1123
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,333
But this is a hospital, my dear.

1124
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,167
These guys are all sick.

1125
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,667
But you all look well.

1126
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:55,583
No, no.

1127
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:57,042
We're all sick.

1128
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,125
What is your illness?

1129
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:01,708
Me?

1130
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,333
My illness...

1131
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:08,000
He got sick because of a girl,
but he's getting better.

1132
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:09,708
How?

1133
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:14,875
I saw a very pretty girl
and snatched her--

1134
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:15,875
Whoa!

1135
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:17,792
-Whoa, nellie!
-You fucking--

1136
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,333
-Good God!
-God forgive me.

1137
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:22,083
I wanted to marry her without her consent.

1138
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,000
When she didn't want me...

1139
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,417
I wanted to kill myself.

1140
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:28,958
That was my illness.

1141
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,667
To kill yourself?

1142
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,083
It was stupid.

1143
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:36,833
As it turns out, love...

1144
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,042
is not to kill yourself for someone,
but is to live no matter what.

1145
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,833
Hello?

1146
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:08,750
Ms. Mine, how are you?

1147
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:14,125
I'm sorry?

1148
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:16,542
What's your illness?

1149
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,250
My illness?

1150
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,000
It's...

1151
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,750
I used to fool people unintentionally.

1152
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,167
I used to take their money.

1153
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,875
I've never heard of such an illness.

1154
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,333
Don't you get it?

1155
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:32,167
I fooled them and ran away with it.

1156
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,708
There was a Beril in our class.

1157
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:37,542
She fooled me and ran away with my bread.

1158
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,250
Just like Halil.

1159
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,333
Halil, it's a sin. It's a sin.

1160
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,333
Did you need money?

1161
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:45,667
A lot.

1162
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,000
Here. I'm not going to buy anything.

1163
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,583
Nana gave it to me.

1164
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:54,708
I can't take it.

1165
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,000
Take it.

1166
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,083
Take that too. Don't be shy.

1167
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,417
I got the news yesterday.

1168
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,417
My brother won the lottery.

1169
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:08,250
We don't need money anymore.

1170
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:10,333
Did you hear that, Ova?

1171
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:12,000
He won the lottery!

1172
01:19:16,542 --> 01:19:17,542
Don't count me in.

1173
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,417
I just work here.

1174
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,417
He's a seasonal worker, Ova.

1175
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
He comes in the winter,
goes in the summer.

1176
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:26,708
And you?

1177
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:28,125
Me?

1178
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:32,292
You're a very lucky girl, you know that?

1179
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:33,750
Why?

1180
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:35,875
I...

1181
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,500
had a son.

1182
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,208
And his mother, of course.

1183
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,333
When my son was a baby,

1184
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:44,708
I couldn't protect him and his mother

1185
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:46,583
like your father protects you.

1186
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:48,750
What happened to them?

1187
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:51,917
They became angels.

1188
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:54,208
Because of me.

1189
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,375
Did you get better?

1190
01:19:58,375 --> 01:19:59,875
For me...

1191
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:01,917
it will take some time, Ova.

1192
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:04,042
Come on, Ova.

1193
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:05,375
We're late, let's go.

1194
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,708
You didn't tell, what's your illness?

1195
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,667
I made a lot of people angels.

1196
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,542
Did you make my mom too?

1197
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,417
No. That wasn't me.

1198
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,958
I quit. I don't make angels anymore.

1199
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:20,875
Why?

1200
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:25,125
Because I may have made some
a little too early.

1201
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,500
Come on, we're late. Let's go.

1202
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:29,583
-My dad?
-Me, me!

1203
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:33,792
I will bring him to you when he's better.

1204
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,667
-Promise?
-Yes, I promise.

1205
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:37,250
Come on.

1206
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,000
Come on, let's go.

1207
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:42,917
Ova?

1208
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,417
Maybe it's better if you didn't ask him.

1209
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,625
What's your illness?

1210
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,000
I...

1211
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,792
believed those who lied to me.

1212
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:10,625
My daughter of wedding age...

1213
01:22:35,542 --> 01:22:36,542
Come on, Ova.

1214
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,500
Come on, dear. We're leaving.

1215
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,250
-We're late. Come--
-We're fucked!

1216
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:42,333
-Quickly!
-Don't curse, there's a child!

1217
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:43,917
The guards, they're all here!

1218
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,375
-Shit!
-What's happening?

1219
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:47,292
Hide!

1220
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:50,000
Over here! Ali, over here!

1221
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,958
Lying is the worst.

1222
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:56,042
Both in this world and beyond,

1223
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,750
when you are--

1224
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,125
Welcome, Warden.

1225
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,917
What is this? What are you doing?

1226
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,083
We're having our usual conversation.

1227
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,167
Is your daughter here?

1228
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,083
Move.

1229
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,167
Ova, you're it! Run!

1230
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,417
What do you think you're doing?

1231
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:50,833
What?

1232
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:53,667
Hafız, for God's sake!

1233
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Any of you.

1234
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:56,792
Give me a sensible answer.

1235
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,583
Askorozlu, what is this?

1236
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,083
Ward confinement, two days. No courtyard.

1237
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,250
Don't you see?

1238
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:06,250
You asked where she is,

1239
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:07,917
and he showed you.

1240
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:10,917
He has a brain the size of a pea!

1241
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,625
I have a report from the board
that says this man is sane!

1242
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,000
A martial law commander put him in here!

1243
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,625
Of course it says that!

1244
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:20,875
Warden.

1245
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:26,000
We believe that Memo is innocent.

1246
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:29,083
The whole ward, we all believe it.

1247
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:30,250
The dead girl

1248
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,417
is the Commander's daughter.

1249
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:35,708
This man was found next to her,
covered in blood.

1250
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:37,417
What can anyone do now?

1251
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,708
The girl mentioned a witness.

1252
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:41,167
Talk to her.

1253
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:45,292
If you find that witness,
you'll save Memo from the noose.

1254
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:46,250
Just talk to her.

1255
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,167
-The girl's just--
-Nail!

1256
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,417
You're a good man.

1257
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,000
What do you have to lose?

1258
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:55,583
What if she's telling the truth?

1259
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:09,167
Act as if you don't know me, okay?

1260
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,667
You don't know me, okay?

1261
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:11,875
Never saw me before.

1262
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:12,792
Okay.

1263
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:13,708
Good girl.

1264
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,625
Ahmet, take him to the ward.

1265
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:24,750
Yes, sir. Come on, Memo. Get up.

1266
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,458
Ova, eat your food, okay?
I eat here, you eat too.

1267
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:29,958
Askorozlu will send me when I get better.

1268
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,208
-Come on.
-You promised.

1269
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,750
-Get up, come on.
-Yes, I did.

1270
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:35,000
-Come on, move.
-Can I stay a little longer?

1271
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,583
Let him go, my dear.

1272
01:25:36,667 --> 01:25:38,250
-Come on, get up.
-Ova.

1273
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,708
All right, walk. Come on.

1274
01:25:39,792 --> 01:25:41,042
Walk, Memo. Come on.

1275
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,500
Come on.

1276
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:47,292
I'll take you home.

1277
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,833
Ova.

1278
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:56,208
Maybe you can tell me about
that witness on the way.

1279
01:25:58,083 --> 01:25:58,917
Come on.

1280
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:16,500
Teacher! Teacher!

1281
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:19,333
They believed me! They believed me!

1282
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:21,542
Of course they did.

1283
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,250
Everyone believes truth tellers.

1284
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:27,500
Why is everybody in our house?

1285
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:30,000
Nana!

1286
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:32,167
Ova.

1287
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:34,750
Where's Nana?

1288
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:38,167
Ova.

1289
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:42,375
Your nana, Fatma...

1290
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:45,583
became an angel.

1291
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,375
Did she go to Heaven?

1292
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,042
She went to Heaven.

1293
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,833
But she told me she wouldn't.

1294
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:02,583
She said that
she wouldn't leave until I grow up.

1295
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,708
Who's going to take care of me now?

1296
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,333
-Peace be with you.
-And with you.

1297
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:20,875
There's supposed to be
some ruins around here.

1298
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,542
-Do you know where?
-Yes.

1299
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:26,917
Can you show me?

1300
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,208
The kid was trying
to tell us all this time.

1301
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,417
It's obvious why the witness is missing,
he's a deserter!

1302
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,250
Nail, he's a martial law commander!

1303
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,583
His daughter is dead!

1304
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:43,125
Does someone being there
make what she says true?

1305
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:44,667
Okay, you're right.

1306
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:46,792
Shouldn't we investigate?

1307
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,500
It's a possibility,
even if it's a small one.

1308
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,333
What if she's right?

1309
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:55,042
This man doesn't feel like a killer.

1310
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,167
Do you think that it's that easy?

1311
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,667
We would all be fucked!

1312
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:04,208
Faruk.

1313
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:07,875
We have to find the deserter
and listen to him.

1314
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:11,792
Patience, patience.

1315
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,667
There's more if you like, Memo.

1316
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,500
Let me eat this one first.

1317
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,042
Eat.

1318
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:20,000
Eat, Memo. Enjoy.

1319
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,042
Slow down. Don't eat the spoon.

1320
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:29,875
Slowly, eat slowly.

1321
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:57,292
<i>Dad!</i>

1322
01:29:58,333 --> 01:29:59,625
<i>Dad!</i>

1323
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,000
<i>Dad!</i>

1324
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,958
We always thought

1325
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,625
that it's just a stain on the wall.

1326
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:22,958
It really looks like a tree.

1327
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,708
That stain, Hafız...

1328
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:34,250
is the tree I buried my daughter under.

1329
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:36,625
My innocent daughter.

1330
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:42,375
Now tell me, Hafız.
Where do I go in the afterlife?

1331
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,083
What about my daughter?

1332
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:51,333
Where does she go?

1333
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:52,750
Heaven.

1334
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,625
Would the man upstairs
allow me into His Heaven?

1335
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:03,042
He works in mysterious ways.

1336
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,625
God is forgiving.

1337
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,542
You will get out of here in 1.5 years.

1338
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,292
I will not.

1339
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:11,500
Hafız. I can't.

1340
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:16,750
I can't live anymore,
not in here, not out there.

1341
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,708
-I don't deserve the sun.
-No.

1342
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,542
Don't talk like that.
How can you say that?

1343
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:24,958
Nisa surah states that--

1344
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:26,958
Don't start with that now.

1345
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:30,500
I'm not that callow boy.

1346
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:33,792
I can't be with my daughter,

1347
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:35,958
not even in the great beyond.

1348
01:31:36,042 --> 01:31:37,542
Only God knows that.

1349
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:43,083
Jesus said, ''Let him who is without sin
cast the first stone.''

1350
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,500
Are you the only sinner here?

1351
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:46,708
Just look around.

1352
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,458
Everybody carries something
that keeps them up at night.

1353
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:54,792
You can't find happiness
by staring at a stain or a tree.

1354
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:57,250
You have to stand up
and ask for forgiveness.

1355
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:59,042
You have to get out of here.

1356
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,500
If you hurt your own daughter,

1357
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:03,667
you have to save other children.

1358
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:40,250
Ova.

1359
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,958
I have great news.

1360
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,583
The Warden found something on that hill.

1361
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:47,125
You were right.

1362
01:32:47,917 --> 01:32:49,542
There was really someone there.

1363
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,833
They're doing all they can to find him.

1364
01:32:57,125 --> 01:32:58,708
They'll find him eventually.

1365
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:00,917
I'm sure of it.

1366
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,500
I, too, love my dad very much,
you know that?

1367
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:23,375
Just...

1368
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:27,250
My dad is a little strict.

1369
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,500
He's not like your dad.

1370
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:34,708
He looks that way.

1371
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:38,667
So they don't think that he's weak.

1372
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:43,250
He's not really like that.

1373
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:49,000
I always wanted to...

1374
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,750
hug him like you do, just once.

1375
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:57,917
I couldn't.

1376
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:03,792
He always took great care
of me and my sister.

1377
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:08,292
But he didn't hug us once.

1378
01:34:08,917 --> 01:34:10,500
Like your dad.

1379
01:34:22,667 --> 01:34:24,792
Would you like me to take you to your dad?

1380
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,708
Gendarmerie Captain Faruk Önder.

1381
01:34:37,292 --> 01:34:38,750
Patch me to Lieutenant Turan.

1382
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:42,958
Turan.

1383
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,333
Hi.

1384
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:50,083
Anything new on the thing
I mentioned last night?

1385
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:52,958
The girl was right.

1386
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:56,083
A deserter was there when it happened.
Şeref told me.

1387
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:57,542
So?

1388
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:01,500
-The Warden's trying to find the deserter.
-What if he can't in time?

1389
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:03,583
He will! Don't be negative!

1390
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:04,750
Don't speak ill.

1391
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:18,375
Look.

1392
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,208
-Hatice.
-Aziz.

1393
01:35:29,417 --> 01:35:30,250
My daughter.

1394
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:31,250
Sweetie.

1395
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:32,708
Sweetie.

1396
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:35,750
My dear girl.

1397
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:37,500
Let me look at my boy.

1398
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,458
My boy.

1399
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,375
How are you?

1400
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:41,292
Come here.

1401
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,208
My dear boy.

1402
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:48,625
Take a seat.

1403
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:50,250
Come on.

1404
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:51,417
Come here.

1405
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:53,667
How are you, Hatice?

1406
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,792
God be praised.

1407
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,542
-How are you, Aziz?
-I'm fine.

1408
01:35:58,167 --> 01:35:59,000
I'm fine.

1409
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,458
I'm better now that you're here.

1410
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:05,208
They've grown so much. Look at them!

1411
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:07,000
Come over here.

1412
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:08,125
Sit next to me.

1413
01:36:12,417 --> 01:36:13,833
How are you, Dad?

1414
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,625
I'm fine, my dear boy.

1415
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:18,583
This time it was my turn, but we all came.

1416
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:20,125
I'm going to come next time too.

1417
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:22,417
Come, boy.

1418
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:24,333
Come, my boy.

1419
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:26,208
Come all together from now on.

1420
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:28,708
No more turns.

1421
01:36:28,792 --> 01:36:30,292
Did you hear that?

1422
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:31,833
You can stop nagging me.

1423
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:37,458
How are your parents?

1424
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:38,875
They're well.

1425
01:36:39,167 --> 01:36:41,208
Praise be. They said hello.

1426
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:46,167
Hatice.

1427
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:47,917
I've been thinking...

1428
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:51,000
When I get out, I...

1429
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:53,833
I'm going to take my boat from my brother.

1430
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:56,042
Work on my own.

1431
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,083
And from now on...

1432
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,667
These guys will help me, right?

1433
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,708
-Okay, Dad.
-We will, Dad.

1434
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:08,667
My boy.

1435
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,417
Thank you, Mr. Nail.

1436
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,417
-If you didn't...
-Don't mention it.

1437
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,625
I wish I could do more.

1438
01:37:34,042 --> 01:37:35,208
What are they doing?

1439
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:38,875
They're setting up the gallows.

1440
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:57,500
This fast?

1441
01:37:58,167 --> 01:37:59,333
They're in a hurry.

1442
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:02,458
They want to get it done
before the elections.

1443
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:04,250
Objections, petitions...

1444
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:06,125
Nobody cares.

1445
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:08,833
An appeal for show.

1446
01:38:09,292 --> 01:38:10,125
That's all.

1447
01:38:15,042 --> 01:38:16,542
They're going to execute Memo.

1448
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:22,208
-Hasan?
-He's fine too.

1449
01:38:22,292 --> 01:38:23,167
And Zeynep?

1450
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:25,625
She's fine too. They're all fine.

1451
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:27,625
Naughty Rıza?

1452
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:28,625
Fine.

1453
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:30,750
But you said you didn't have anyone.

1454
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,083
I don't. I have Grandma and Ova.

1455
01:38:33,167 --> 01:38:34,625
But you mentioned 50 people.

1456
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,917
Not 50, eight.

1457
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Who are those?

1458
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:38,833
The sheep.

1459
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:42,125
You gave people names to the sheep?

1460
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,333
This asshole--

1461
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:45,917
Not all of them.

1462
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,208
What, then?

1463
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:48,792
There's Milky, there's Coffee.

1464
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:51,292
Why are those different?

1465
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,042
Because one is the color of milk.

1466
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:55,167
And the other one has stains like coffee.

1467
01:38:57,292 --> 01:38:58,625
Good God!

1468
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:00,750
Ova, how's Grandma?

1469
01:39:03,542 --> 01:39:05,333
Nana became an angel, Dad.

1470
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:32,708
I'm sorry, son.

1471
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:50,125
Dad.

1472
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:51,292
Dad.

1473
01:39:51,542 --> 01:39:52,375
Dad.

1474
01:39:58,167 --> 01:39:59,042
Grandma.

1475
01:40:22,542 --> 01:40:23,375
At ease.

1476
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:28,667
Did you desert from the Gölbaşı
Gendermarie Command on April 23rd?

1477
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:29,875
Yes, sir.

1478
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:32,458
Were you around Kapıkırı

1479
01:40:32,542 --> 01:40:34,042
at 1600 hours on the same day?

1480
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:35,208
Yes, sir.

1481
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:37,417
Did you witness the incident on the rocks?

1482
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:40,292
I did, sir.

1483
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:41,667
Speak.

1484
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:48,917
We found him, Nail.

1485
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:50,917
He verified everything
the little girl said.

1486
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,083
Memo is innocent.

1487
01:40:52,625 --> 01:40:53,458
Let's go.

1488
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:02,500
Come in.

1489
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:05,167
-Sir.
-Come in, Cevdet.

1490
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,250
-Remove the cuffs.
-Sir, yes sir!

1491
01:41:46,792 --> 01:41:47,625
You can leave.

1492
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,375
Sir, yes sir.

1493
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,333
Why did you desert your outfit?

1494
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:01,042
I couldn't take it anymore, sir.

1495
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:03,333
It's hard, huh?

1496
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,458
-No, sir. It's not that--
-Shut up!

1497
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,542
He couldn't take it.

1498
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:20,917
You witnessed the incident.

1499
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:21,833
Yes, sir.

1500
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:24,000
Good.

1501
01:42:25,958 --> 01:42:27,958
What you know can save the crazy man.

1502
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:28,875
Yes, sir.

1503
01:42:42,917 --> 01:42:44,000
Tell me.

1504
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,000
The kids were playing by the lake, sir.

1505
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:48,625
Then that shepherd came.

1506
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:51,500
Other kids went away, the girl stayed.

1507
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:55,667
The girl was showing
her backpack to the shepherd, sir.

1508
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,167
She was playing with him.

1509
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:08,708
-He tried to escape.
-Sir, yes sir!

1510
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:31,167
Turan.
What's going on? What's with the face?

1511
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:34,292
<i>Lieutenant learned everything</i>
<i>from the boy.</i>

1512
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,583
<i>The witness said that Memo is innocent.</i>

1513
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:39,500
But then the Commander wanted to
speak to the boy.

1514
01:43:39,583 --> 01:43:42,000
When they were speaking,
he tried to escape.

1515
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:43,250
And the Commander shot him.

1516
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,750
Is he dead?

1517
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:46,625
He died right there.

1518
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:49,958
He's really bent on Memo.

1519
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:53,375
What the hell is this?

1520
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,500
A deserter died,
who's going to investigate?

1521
01:43:59,292 --> 01:44:00,125
God forgive.

1522
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:02,750
Fuck this shit!

1523
01:44:03,417 --> 01:44:04,708
Can't we do anything?

1524
01:44:26,083 --> 01:44:29,542
WHO COMES IN DECENTLY
LEAVES RESPECTFULLY

1525
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:30,458
Memo.

1526
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:32,333
Come with me.

1527
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:35,583
Get up, boy.

1528
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:38,750
Ova's here.

1529
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:56,333
Teacher, why are we waiting here?

1530
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:58,125
We're going to see your dad.

1531
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:00,667
Why don't we see him downstairs?

1532
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,292
He's coming upstairs.

1533
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:04,708
But I have friends in the ward too.

1534
01:45:04,792 --> 01:45:05,833
Really?

1535
01:45:06,292 --> 01:45:07,542
Did you hear that?

1536
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:09,125
Ova has friends downstairs.

1537
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,208
Of course, lots of them.

1538
01:45:11,833 --> 01:45:13,833
You can see them anytime you like.

1539
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:15,583
Come in.

1540
01:45:19,417 --> 01:45:21,625
-Ova!
-Dad!

1541
01:45:24,542 --> 01:45:26,583
They said that we're meeting here today.

1542
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:32,125
Ova doesn't eat.

1543
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,042
She's thin like Milky.

1544
01:45:35,792 --> 01:45:38,083
Heidi has an aunt, Ova doesn't.

1545
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:39,667
Grandma is gone too.

1546
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,333
So... who's going to take care of Ova?

1547
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:45,208
No, Memo. I take very good care of Ova.

1548
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:46,625
Don't you worry.

1549
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:50,667
I'm staying at my teacher's for now.
We'll go home when you get back.

1550
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:51,625
Our home.

1551
01:45:52,292 --> 01:45:53,833
Yes, we will. Memo will come,

1552
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:55,333
and we will go home.

1553
01:45:55,917 --> 01:45:57,292
Yes, Dad.

1554
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:06,833
Can I go with Ova?

1555
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:09,792
Be patient, Memo. In a couple of days.

1556
01:46:10,625 --> 01:46:11,542
Look, Dad.

1557
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:15,208
We go to sleep, wake up, go to sleep,
wake up and then you'll be home.

1558
01:46:18,417 --> 01:46:19,750
I'm going to come get Ova, right?

1559
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,083
Yes, Memo.

1560
01:46:26,083 --> 01:46:28,417
Teacher's going to
take care of Ova until then.

1561
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,667
Of course I am.

1562
01:46:33,542 --> 01:46:35,167
Why are you doing this, Dad?

1563
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:41,458
I'm going to take care.

1564
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:43,458
Lingo lingo!

1565
01:46:43,917 --> 01:46:44,958
Bottles.

1566
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,917
We're almost there, Dad. All right?

1567
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:53,042
Ova, we should go now.

1568
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:55,875
Ova.

1569
01:46:56,833 --> 01:46:58,708
-Dad, don't.
-Come on.

1570
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:01,667
Ova, Ova! Memo's child Ova!

1571
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,583
Dad, don't. Why are you sad?

1572
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,250
You don't separate children.

1573
01:47:05,333 --> 01:47:07,125
-Why are you doing this, Dad?
-Come on, Ova.

1574
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,708
We'll come again.

1575
01:47:08,792 --> 01:47:10,208
-Come on, Ova.
-Let Ova stay.

1576
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:13,583
Okay, Memo. She can come back anytime.
I'll sneak her in.

1577
01:47:13,667 --> 01:47:14,750
I want to go too.

1578
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:17,667
-Memo, don't make this harder.
-I want to go too.

1579
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:19,833
Dad, don't be sad. Don't do that.

1580
01:47:19,917 --> 01:47:21,750
-Ova, come on.
-I don't want to!

1581
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:23,958
-Don't, Dad.
-I don't want to!

1582
01:47:24,042 --> 01:47:25,500
I don't want to be an angel!

1583
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:27,875
-Dad!
-Who's going to take care of Ova?

1584
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,875
I don't want to.

1585
01:47:31,583 --> 01:47:33,917
Ova, come on. We'll come again.

1586
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:36,708
Me execution.

1587
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:44,375
Me execution.

1588
01:47:51,167 --> 01:47:52,000
Teacher.

1589
01:47:52,917 --> 01:47:54,000
Memo execution?

1590
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:02,542
Dad execution?

1591
01:48:07,292 --> 01:48:08,292
No.

1592
01:48:08,958 --> 01:48:11,375
No, Dad said it wrong. Not execution.

1593
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:12,625
Not execution.

1594
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:15,250
Dad is good man.

1595
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:17,583
Dad is good man.

1596
01:48:29,458 --> 01:48:31,000
Come on, Memo.

1597
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:32,000
Come on.

1598
01:48:32,917 --> 01:48:34,458
-Come on, son.
-Get up.

1599
01:48:34,542 --> 01:48:36,000
-Come on, Memo.
-Come on.

1600
01:48:36,917 --> 01:48:38,542
Come on. Good boy.

1601
01:49:04,167 --> 01:49:05,000
Memo?

1602
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:06,833
Get up, son.

1603
01:49:06,917 --> 01:49:07,750
Come on.

1604
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:09,000
Come on.

1605
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:19,833
<i>I'm going to tell you two things, Ova.</i>

1606
01:49:21,167 --> 01:49:24,083
<i>The first one is about truth.</i>

1607
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:27,417
<i>You know the birds</i>

1608
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,583
<i>that your father runs after?</i>

1609
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:33,375
<i>They aren't flying to Heaven.</i>

1610
01:49:34,292 --> 01:49:35,958
<i>They come in the summer,</i>

1611
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:37,917
<i>and leave in the winter.</i>

1612
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:55,292
<i>The second one...</i>

1613
01:49:55,917 --> 01:49:57,667
<i>is about your father, Ova.</i>

1614
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,625
<i>Whatever they say,</i>

1615
01:50:01,125 --> 01:50:03,042
<i>whatever they order,</i>

1616
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:05,750
<i>whatever punishment they give,</i>

1617
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:08,708
<i>your father is a good man.</i>

1618
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,833
<i>Remember that.</i>

1619
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:14,667
<i>Your father is a good man.</i>

1620
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,625
Give me your blessing, son.

1621
01:50:44,792 --> 01:50:46,583
Come on, come on.

1622
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:58,208
Come on, come on.

1623
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:04,625
Come, son. Come with me.

1624
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,375
Come on, this way.

1625
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:08,583
-I forgot to kiss your hand.
-All right.

1626
01:51:08,792 --> 01:51:10,375
Okay. Come on.

1627
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:28,375
Come here, asshole.

1628
01:51:39,833 --> 01:51:41,333
Maybe I should stay here.

1629
01:51:41,417 --> 01:51:43,292
-Come on.
-I should stay.

1630
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:44,792
-Here, huh?
-Come on, Memo.

1631
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:46,875
I should chop onions.

1632
01:53:48,167 --> 01:53:49,125
Ova?

1633
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:50,417
Are you up? Come.

1634
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:52,458
Come here.

1635
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:55,458
You're going to be cold.

1636
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,333
Come with me.

1637
01:54:05,583 --> 01:54:06,417
Come.

1638
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:32,458
Good morning, Ova.

1639
01:55:05,667 --> 01:55:07,083
The man who sent you this...

1640
01:55:18,917 --> 01:55:19,750
TWO DAYS EARLIER

1641
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:20,917
Look, Yusuf Ağa.

1642
01:55:21,375 --> 01:55:24,292
You've really gone crazy
staring at that stain on the wall!

1643
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:25,542
Keep it down!

1644
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:26,875
Listen to him!

1645
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:28,333
He's right.

1646
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:30,167
Is this the solution?

1647
01:55:30,458 --> 01:55:31,417
Yes it is!

1648
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:34,042
What's he saying, Hafız?

1649
01:55:34,125 --> 01:55:36,458
Be quiet, Askorozlu.
God give me patience!

1650
01:55:36,542 --> 01:55:37,625
For the first time...

1651
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,500
I saw my daughter in my dream.

1652
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:44,375
For the first time.

1653
01:55:47,042 --> 01:55:47,875
That...

1654
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,000
was my final word.

1655
01:56:04,125 --> 01:56:04,958
Come in.

1656
01:56:08,125 --> 01:56:08,958
Warden.

1657
01:56:09,417 --> 01:56:11,125
Askorozlu wants to talk to you.

1658
01:56:11,917 --> 01:56:13,083
About what?

1659
01:56:15,208 --> 01:56:16,417
It's urgent, Warden.

1660
01:56:17,458 --> 01:56:19,208
Yusuf Ağa sent me.

1661
01:56:20,125 --> 01:56:21,500
I'm his messenger.

1662
01:56:34,792 --> 01:56:36,667
Faruk, say something, for God's sake.

1663
01:56:39,042 --> 01:56:41,708
This is the most ridiculous plan
I've ever heard.

1664
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:43,542
Yes.

1665
01:56:44,542 --> 01:56:45,375
Me too.

1666
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:57,250
Don't go crazy.

1667
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:59,500
It's a sensitive issue.

1668
01:56:59,583 --> 01:57:02,667
-It's been sensitive for years, sir.
-Pray that there's a soldier here.

1669
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,625
Enough!

1670
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:07,708
I need both of your help.

1671
01:57:11,417 --> 01:57:12,417
<i>What's going on?</i>

1672
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,083
<i>The left and right wingers, sir.</i>

1673
01:57:14,167 --> 01:57:15,583
<i>It's big this time.</i>

1674
01:57:15,667 --> 01:57:17,458
Send everybody there.

1675
01:57:17,542 --> 01:57:19,000
Everybody. You too. Quickly!

1676
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:21,000
Guards, you too. Come on!

1677
01:57:31,875 --> 01:57:33,375
Quickly! You too!

1678
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:11,417
Thank you, Askorozlu.

1679
01:58:12,042 --> 01:58:13,042
Thank you.

1680
01:58:13,833 --> 01:58:14,667
My Ağa.

1681
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:27,583
You...

1682
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:31,625
You are uniting a father and daughter
who don't have anyone else.

1683
01:58:32,375 --> 01:58:34,125
The place of a man who does this...

1684
01:58:35,417 --> 01:58:37,625
is Heaven, whatever his sin may be.

1685
01:58:39,583 --> 01:58:40,958
Thank you, brother.

1686
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,042
Thank you.

1687
01:58:49,167 --> 01:58:50,125
Give this...

1688
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:52,708
to Ova.

1689
01:58:53,833 --> 01:58:56,333
I have nothing else of value.

1690
01:59:03,042 --> 01:59:04,583
Thank you, Warden.

1691
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:05,958
Thank you.

1692
01:59:11,708 --> 01:59:13,167
Give me your blessing.

1693
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:14,958
It's yours.

1694
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:14,750
No, don't tie his hands.

1695
02:00:43,917 --> 02:00:45,083
Let's go, Prosecutor.

1696
02:01:05,917 --> 02:01:07,167
We can't wait any longer.

1697
02:01:07,417 --> 02:01:09,583
But the Prosecutor
and the Colonel aren't here yet.

1698
02:01:10,167 --> 02:01:11,417
It's almost prayer time.

1699
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,875
He escaped during last night's chaos.

1700
02:02:17,958 --> 02:02:19,458
Start a search, immediately.

1701
02:02:19,875 --> 02:02:21,000
He can't be far.

1702
02:02:22,958 --> 02:02:23,833
Go on.

1703
02:02:25,417 --> 02:02:26,417
Come on, come on!

1704
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:29,125
Alert all near stations, at once!

1705
02:02:30,625 --> 02:02:31,458
Where is he?

1706
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:33,167
I hid him in the back of my vehicle.

1707
02:02:33,583 --> 02:02:34,583
We should hurry.

1708
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,167
The man who sent you this...

1709
02:02:55,583 --> 02:02:56,917
also sent you your dad.

1710
02:03:21,792 --> 02:03:24,542
Lingo lingo!

1711
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:29,667
Bottles?

1712
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:30,833
Ova!

1713
02:03:32,125 --> 02:03:33,333
Dad!

1714
02:03:57,875 --> 02:03:58,958
Jump, jump!

1715
02:03:59,042 --> 02:03:59,958
Jump on Dad!

1716
02:04:00,333 --> 02:04:01,375
Dad is a horse!

1717
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:04,750
We're here!

1718
02:04:05,167 --> 02:04:06,417
We're here!

1719
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,542
Go fast!

1720
02:04:12,083 --> 02:04:13,667
Come on, very fast!

1721
02:04:46,625 --> 02:04:48,458
Memo's child!

1722
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:54,042
-Where did you come from?
-Turkey.

1723
02:04:54,583 --> 02:04:57,458
-Why?
-To escape police violence.

1724
02:04:57,917 --> 02:04:59,167
-Who's that?
-My dad.

1725
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:02,167
He looks funny, what's wrong with him?

1726
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,250
The soldiers did it.

1727
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:05,250
Good girl.

1728
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:07,667
Nail.

1729
02:05:09,333 --> 02:05:10,167
She...

1730
02:05:11,042 --> 02:05:12,417
shouldn't say soldiers.

1731
02:05:13,458 --> 02:05:16,833
She should say there was a clash
between rival groups or something.

1732
02:05:16,917 --> 02:05:20,083
Faruk, is that
what you're worried about right now?

1733
02:05:32,417 --> 02:05:33,250
Captain.

1734
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:40,458
Come on, someone will see us.

1735
02:05:41,375 --> 02:05:42,333
All right, come on.

1736
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:51,458
Say hi to my friends!

1737
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:53,167
Quiet!

1738
02:06:25,542 --> 02:06:26,958
Where are we going, Ova?

1739
02:06:27,042 --> 02:06:29,292
You don't know anything, Dad.

1740
02:12:00,375 --> 02:12:03,292
