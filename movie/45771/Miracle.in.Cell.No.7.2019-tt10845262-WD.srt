00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,291
Thank you, pa.

3
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,424
What's your plan?

4
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,137
I will file an urgent motion
to reopen the case.

5
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,306
It will not be easy, child.

6
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,228
It won't be easy, but it is not impossible.

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,564
Right there, Papa! Lift it a bit higher!

8
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,651
Here?

9
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,028
Right there. It's so pretty!

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,243
Wow! It's so pretty. It's spacious.

11
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,619
Is it perfect for my Yesha?

12
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,956
Thanks, Papa!

13
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,591
Let's paint it.

14
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,720
Look, Yesha.

15
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:33,194
Thank you Lord for the
blessings you've given us.

16
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,863
Amen.

17
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:42,620
Thank you God for Yesha.

18
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:54,716
In the name of the father, and of the son,
and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

19
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,052
Let's sleep.

20
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,848
Goodnight, Papa.

21
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,683
Goodnight, Yesha.

22
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,727
Sweet dreams.

23
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,104
Sweet dreams.

24
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,062
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

25
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,025
How I wonder what you are

26
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,278
Thank you, Papa.

27
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,117
Mambo!

28
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,788
Hey! I thought we were going
to surprise the pastor.

29
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,124
She is our surprise.

30
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,585
What is it?

31
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:17,090
Is she 18 years old? If she's a minor,
you're going back in jail.

32
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,013
Oh no, no. Spare me,
I don't want to go back to jail.

33
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,474
Stay away. Do not touch me,
do not talk to me. I don't--

34
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,185
You idiot! That's Yesha!

35
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,981
Is she… I knew it!

36
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,359
Yesha. Yesha?

37
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,902
Is it really you?

38
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:46,786
This is the day, this is the day
that the Lord has made.

39
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:57,296
Temptations and our worldly desires
drive us towards sin

40
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,091
Let us pray.

41
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,719
Lord

42
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,012
Lord

43
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,431
We come to you

44
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,474
We come to you

45
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,644
What are you doing here?

46
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,813
What are you doing here?

47
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,108
Yesha?

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,443
Yesha?

49
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
Yesha!

50
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,571
Yesha!

51
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:27,285
Whatever the verdict,
you did everything you could.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,084
Sign this.

53
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,257
Thank you.

54
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,772
Wait a minute.
I'm getting a bit nervous.

55
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,775
What are you afraid of?

56
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,028
I feel like we're about to be sentenced.

57
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,030
We are not accused.

58
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,575
There you are!
What's the news?

59
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,788
I have enough to defend my father.

60
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,084
Justice for Joselito Gopez!

61
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,919
Justice!

62
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,218
Papa, we've been looking
at my bag every single day

63
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,262
but we still haven't bought it

64
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,808
I can buy it tomorrow

65
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,939
Tomorrow? Really? Really, Papa?

66
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,607
Yay!

67
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,942
- Thank you, Papa!
- Yay!

68
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,193
Yay!

69
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,529
Yay! I'll finally have my bag!

70
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,363
Yay!

71
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,826
Wow!

72
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,327
Wow!

73
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,787
Wow!

74
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,684
My bag!

75
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,685
Hey!

76
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,353
Bag!

77
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,856
Oh! That's cute! Alright.

78
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,024
Go ahead and use it, yeah?

79
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,359
That is Yesha's bag.

80
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,862
We've been staring at
that bag every single day.

81
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
I mean to buy it tomorrow.
I'll have my pay tomorrow.

82
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,032
- What the hell are you doing?
- That is Yesha's bag.

83
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,284
What are you doing?

84
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,244
- I will buy this bag for Yesha.
- Do not touch my daughter!

85
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,620
- That's Yesha's Sailor Moon bag!
- Hey, you!

86
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,329
Sailor Moon bag--

87
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,039
Get your hands off my daughter!

88
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,252
Don't you know who I am?

89
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,753
Stay out of this!

90
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,589
Don't you know me?

91
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:45,965
- Please, mister!
- That's enough!

92
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,133
Don't you lay your hands
on my daughter!

93
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,759
That's enough. Let's go.

94
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,802
This is embarrassing.

95
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,928
We're leaving.

96
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,224
It's okay Papa...

97
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,268
I will get you your bag, Yesha, okay?

98
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,606
Don't cry, Yesha.

99
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,634
Papa…

100
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,803
What are we going to do about my bag?

101
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,099
I will try looking in other stores.

102
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,729
Uh…maybe they don't have it anymore.

103
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,358
Maybe they don't have it anymore

104
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,487
If you can't find it, it's fine.

105
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,490
If you can't find it, it's fine.

106
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,117
But my Yesha will be heartbroken.

107
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,412
I don't want my Yesha to be sad.

108
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,594
Papa!

109
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,887
Papa!

110
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:19,892
Yesha! Yesha!
She's not sad anymore!

111
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,477
I'm going to be late for school!

112
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,187
Papa!

113
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,774
Yesha!

114
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,902
Wait for me, okay?

115
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,821
What?

116
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,240
I said, wait for me.

117
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,783
What did you say?

118
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,618
I will wait for you?

119
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,370
Wait--

120
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,041
You won't hear me
with your hands like that.

121
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,711
But the music is too loud!

122
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,338
It's always better with music!
Happy, right?

123
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,717
What are you doing?

124
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,487
That stinks!

125
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,907
This smells better. Come on.

126
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,493
Eat all of your lunch, alright?

127
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,664
Yes, Papa. You do the same.
Eat your lunch, too.

128
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,083
Be careful when you cross the street.

129
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,879
You be careful, too,
when crossing the street.

130
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,674
Look to the left, look to the right.

131
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,343
Bye!

132
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,181
Bye Yesha!

133
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,599
Bye, Papa!

134
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,688
1…2…3!

135
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,492
Buh-bye!

136
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,160
Bye, Papa!

137
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,995
Bye Yesha!

138
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:19,553
Fifty…Sixty..Seventy..
 Fifty, sixty, seventy…

139
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,180
We'll go ahead, Joselito.

140
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,683
Buh-bye!

141
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,858
Joel, nevermind unloading the boxes, alright.

142
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,110
Joel, nevermind unloading the boxes, alright.
- Wait a minute.

143
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,611
Deliver them straight to General.

144
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,198
Jenny, don't fiddle with it.
Wait 'til we get home, please?

145
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,991
Let's go. Go inside the car. Come on.

146
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:41,909
Fifty…sixty…

147
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,660
Fifty…sixty…
- Jenny!

148
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,662
Mister! Mister!

149
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,664
I'm always getting interrupted!

150
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,291
Have you bought a Sailor Moon bag?

151
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,210
Sailor Moon bag?

152
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,045
Yesha wants a Sailor Moon bag!

153
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,881
Come with me. I know where they sell it.

154
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,217
Where? I'm buying a Sailor Moon bag.

155
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,677
Come on.

156
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,640
Wait for me! I'm buying a Sailor Moon bag!

157
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,101
Yesha will be surprised!

158
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,145
Why do you talk like that?

159
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,688
It's funny!

160
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,815
Come with me! Here! It's right here!

161
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,277
You're too fast.

162
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,028
Wait!

163
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,491
Wait! Wait for me.

164
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,048
Help!

165
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,508
Help!

166
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,510
Help!

167
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,892
Help!

168
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,460
They are bringing in the suspect
but the director has not yet arrived.

169
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,836
Here he comes.

170
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,006
Joselito! Joselito!

171
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,592
Is it true that you murdered the child?

172
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,720
What was running through your head when you did it?

173
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,391
Did you have accomplices?

174
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,519
Were you drunk or on drugs?

175
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,731
What was your motive?

176
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,650
Joselito! Joselito!

177
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,827
Okay, sir.

178
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,038
I'll take care of it, sir.

179
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,125
I am going home.

180
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,168
Yesha is waiting for me.

181
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,461
What is your name?

182
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,380
I am Joselito Gopez.

183
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,173
You may call me Lito.

184
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,925
Do you have any idea why you're here?

185
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,011
Yesha. Yesha is waiting for me.

186
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:48,804
Hold on. I'm leaving.

187
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,014
Hold on. I'm leaving.
- You can't.

188
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,473
You're not allowed to leave.

189
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,394
Wait, hold on. Yesha is all by herself.

190
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,437
It's dark!

191
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,273
Tell us! What made you do it?

192
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:01,859
Speak up.

193
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,237
I need to go to Yesha. Buh-bye!

194
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,572
Bye!

195
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,489
Buh-bye. I am going home.

196
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,741
Buh-bye. I am going home.
- You think you're getting away, huh?

197
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,535
- Hey, that's enough!
- Trying to get away?

198
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,412
You can't.

199
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,289
That hurts!

200
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,379
We are here at the location where the crime took place,

201
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,840
the murder of seven-year old Jenny Yulo,

202
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,717
the daughter of Secretary Johnny Yulo.

203
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,346
In a few moments we shall witness
the reenactment of the crime

204
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,308
involving the alleged suspect Joselito Gopez

205
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,144
And right on time, the suspect has just arrived.

206
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:24,608
Stay tuned for our blow-by-blow coverage
of the case as it happens.

207
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,779
Joselito! Joselito, what have you to say for yourself?

208
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,699
You are being accused for the murder of the child.

209
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,369
Joselito, what can you tell us?
You're being pointed as the suspect.

210
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,332
Why did you kill the little girl?

211
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,961
Show us what you did to the girl.

212
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,673
Show us! It won't take long.
Show us what you did.

213
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,592
Like this?

214
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,302
You strangled her?

215
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,512
Let him speak.

216
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,389
What were you doing with her pants?

217
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,852
Show us how it happened.
The jeans-- show us how you assaulted the little girl.

218
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:00,936
So we can all go home.

219
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,147
I'm going home to Yesha?

220
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,025
That's right. Show us how
you zipped open the child's pants.

221
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,360
Do it on your pants. Do it.

222
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,320
Show us!

223
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,740
Show us how you unzipped it.

224
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,079
You raped the child.

225
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,582
Confess. You raped her.

226
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,667
Yesha is looking for me.

227
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,960
We're taking you home if you confess.

228
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:27,211
You raped the child!

229
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,423
Admit it.

230
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,175
Just confess.

231
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,801
Confess.

232
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,845
You raped the child.

233
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,388
- Admit it.
- I'm going home to Yesha!

234
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,890
Confess.

235
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,975
- Papa!
- Yesha!

236
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,269
- Yesha!
- Papa!

237
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,437
Papa!

238
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,563
Papa!

239
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,273
Get the kid out of here!

240
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,237
Papa! Papa!

241
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,657
You're going to get sick, Yesha.

242
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,457
Wait for me at home!

243
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,501
You're going to catch a cold.

244
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,336
Wait for me at home!

245
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,338
Yesha!

246
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,589
Yesha!

247
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,678
This will be your new home.

248
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,430
Like the houses you came from,

249
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,267
respect this place.

250
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,229
You can think of these bars as your prison.

251
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:12,860
But you may yet find here the freedom
and peace that you seek.

252
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,779
Sir, the new inmates have arrived.

253
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:21,159
Sir, you look like you're about to leave.
Would you rather see them tomorrow?

254
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,786
Bring them in.

255
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,371
Yes, sir.

256
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,441
Get the rest behind bars.
Gopez stays here.

257
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,026
You heard the man, go!

258
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,707
I need to call Yesha. I'm going to use the phone.

259
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,709
5483, you want to use the telephone?

260
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,838
My name is Joselito. You may call me Lito.

261
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,006
I am going to call Yesha.

262
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,469
You are facing kidnapping, rape, and murder.
Isn't that right?

263
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,179
I'm calling Yesha.

264
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:24,598
Yesha is waiting for my call.

265
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,558
Okay, let him go.

266
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,101
Thank you.

267
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,108
Sir Johnny!

268
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,568
Sir Johnny, don't do it!

269
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,569
Sir Johnny, hey!

270
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,031
Get him out of here.

271
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,699
That hurts.

272
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,034
Yesha!

273
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,410
Sir Johnny.

274
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,314
Hey, Mambo.
What's wrong with you?

275
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,524
Are you trying to take a peek at me?

276
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,733
No, I wasn't.
I was reaching for the soap.

277
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,276
What soap?

278
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,486
You think I don't know?

279
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,946
You were feeling me up last night.

280
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,572
Hey, that wasn't me.
You're dreaming.

281
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,324
You fantasize too much,
I saw you last night.

282
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,117
What?

283
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,536
How about this? You want this?
You want this, huh?

284
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,620
Don't touch me, Choi!

285
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
This is what you want, right?

286
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,710
There you have it! Have at it! Go on!

287
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,879
- Hey!
- Smell it! Smell it!

288
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,588
HEY!

289
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,632
Enough with the monkey business!

290
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,938
Have some shame.

291
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,900
I don't want any trouble.

292
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,825
This is Boss Sol. He's the big man around here.

293
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,078
I'm Bong.

294
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:10,871
Boo!

295
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,124
How is everybody doing?

296
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,459
Hello.

297
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:17,919
Choi.

298
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:24,968
Mambo.

299
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,636
This is your spot.

300
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,139
The rest is occupied.

301
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,477
I'm Celso.

302
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,687
Just call me Tatang.

303
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,356
My name is Joselito.

304
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,150
You may call me Lito.

305
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,610
I'm from Laguna.

306
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,863
My birthday is on January 18, 1961.

307
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,033
My mother Berta had a difficult time giving birth to me.

308
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,870
She died when I was five years old.

309
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,914
I never met my father.

310
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,961
I was raised by my uncle and aunt.

311
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,088
You talk too much!

312
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,672
I don't want any trouble.

313
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,341
What are you in for?

314
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,760
They said it was kidnapping,

315
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,137
rape, and murder, they said.

316
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,306
Why, you're a rotten son of a bitch!

317
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,557
You animal!

318
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,780
Look after her.

319
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,406
The poor thing.

320
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,493
Alright, thank you.

321
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,343
Want to come inside?

322
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,180
I don't want to be here.

323
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,311
You know…

324
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,858
it is our responsibility to care for children.

325
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,237
So if any of the children try to run away,
leave, or get lost…

326
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,114
I don't look for them.

327
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,200
This is an orphanage,

328
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,870
not a Lost and Found.

329
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:16,830
Yesha,

330
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,791
you will like it here.

331
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,794
You will make many new friends.

332
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,507
Come with me. Let's go inside.

333
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,102
Here.

334
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:40,937
Baby oil.

335
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,064
Take it.

336
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,150
We're spot cash, alright.

337
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,445
Here's some soap.

338
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,241
If you want, we can end him right now.

339
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:56,828
Shampoo.

340
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,540
I'd take on anyone.

341
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,176
Boss Sol!

342
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,057
Joselito!

343
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,100
Joselito!

344
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,937
Perez!

345
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,438
Perez!

346
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,233
Joselito got stabbed!

347
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,827
Nobody move!

348
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,122
Here you are, Joselito.

349
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:42,832
You can keep this.

350
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,418
Thank you.

351
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,883
Thank you, Lito.

352
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,219
You saved my life.

353
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,721
What would you like for it?

354
00:25:59,474 --> 00:25:59,849
Bro,

355
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,601
you can ask for whatever you want.

356
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,812
Food, supplies, clothing?

357
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,981
We can even get a woman in here.

358
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,985
Bossing can get you anything, easy.

359
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,738
So think hard about what you really want.

360
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,573
Don't blow your chance.

361
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,287
I want to see Yesha.

362
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,538
Chesa?

363
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:22,998
Hmm?

364
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,165
Are chesa in season?

365
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,042
There's a big Chesa tree at Bong's.

366
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,294
At his house.

367
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,503
That works.

368
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:29,587
No problem at all.

369
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,672
No problem at all.
- Not Chesa.

370
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,134
Oh… you want some chicks.

371
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,635
You should have just said so sooner.

372
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Not chicks.

373
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,555
Yesha.

374
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,889
My daughter.

375
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,412
How did those kids get in here?

376
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,914
Take care of that.

377
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,088
Sir Johnny, Sec. Yulo wants you in the office.

378
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,226
Hey! Watch it!

379
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,103
- I'll help you with it.
- What? No, I'll do it.

380
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:27,812
No, I'll help you.

381
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,855
No, I can do it.

382
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:29,898
Sir, sir...

383
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,149
I really have to take a dump.

384
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,151
I'm sorry.

385
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,403
Fine, fine, go.

386
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,405
He's crazy.

387
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,790
Not so fast!

388
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,323
You really are gay.

389
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,507
Trash!

390
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,925
Collecting garbage!

391
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,557
Where are they? It's taking so long.

392
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,312
Trash! Trash!

393
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,489
This is wrong.

394
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,366
I shouldn't have done this!

395
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,375
- Papa!
- Yesha!

396
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,668
Shh!

397
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,212
Yesha... Yesha.

398
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,724
Papa!

399
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,646
Why did you leave me?

400
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,273
Why did you leave me?

401
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,691
No, Yesha. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

402
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,027
They threw me in here. I got jailed.

403
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,990
Oh jeez. We're dead.

404
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,619
We're going to get dragged into this shit.

405
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,912
I don't want anything to do with that.

406
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,497
I don't want to rot here.

407
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,373
- Guard! Guard!
- Shush!

408
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:54,626
Guard!

409
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,629
- Guard!
- What is it?

410
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,635
What's your problem?

411
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,387
WHAT?!

412
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:13,853
What do you want?

413
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,774
I'm hungry. Do you have some grub?

414
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,152
Are you taking the piss?

415
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,364
Earlier it was this buffoon- now, you.

416
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,534
You know, that's your problem.

417
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,537
Hey, you.

418
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,997
You're not done mopping.

419
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,291
I had to crap.

420
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,006
What is that?

421
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:47,804
A drum?

422
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:51,975
Okay.

423
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,329
There, we're even.

424
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,373
Thank you.

425
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,710
Yesha, my darling!

426
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:19,711
Yesha!

427
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,631
Let's not make too much noise.

428
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,927
Your daughter's a sharp one.

429
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:29,971
Is she really yours?

430
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,265
Yes.

431
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,058
Yesha Marie Gopez.

432
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:39,272
Born December 23, 1991, 12:28 in the afternoon...

433
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,316
at Fabella hospital.

434
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,320
The doctor said she's pretty
because her father is handsome.

435
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,614
5.9 pounds.

436
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,033
Here, this is for you.

437
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,327
Thank you, sir.

438
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,874
Papa, isn't this a prison?

439
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,252
Yes, it is.

440
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,049
Only bad people go to prison, right?

441
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,426
You're a good person, aren't you, Papa?

442
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,013
Yes, Papa's a good guy, Yesha.

443
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,806
I am not a criminal.

444
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,600
They are.

445
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,561
That's just great.

446
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,362
Wait, wait. Hold on a second.

447
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,946
Why are you coming back?

448
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:29,781
The show's over.

449
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,575
The concert's over?

450
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,535
That's a concert,
it shouldn’t be over so soon.

451
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,872
Two of the kids fainted, might be the heat.

452
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,505
Shit, get out of the way. Excuse me.

453
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,677
What is it? What's the matter?

454
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,470
The uh…the--

455
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,304
What's wrong?

456
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,723
The kids…the kids are leaving.

457
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,516
They're leaving?

458
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,226
Oh no, they're leaving.

459
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,769
I want to stay here!

460
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,563
We can't do that, Yesha.

461
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,315
I don't want to leave.

462
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,775
Hey, little girl.

463
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,777
You can't stay here.

464
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,320
Don't scare her.

465
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,364
Go on, hurry up or you'll get left behind.

466
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,532
Please let me stay here.

467
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,575
Can we hide her?

468
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,576
No way!

469
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,537
Yesha has to go to school.

470
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,664
Do you want her to grow up a fool?

471
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,624
A nitwit like…

472
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:22,875
like…

473
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,837
Like him! Like him! The lot of them!

474
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,213
Little girl, little girl…

475
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,548
if you stay here,

476
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,133
your Papa will get in trouble.

477
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,592
Papa!

478
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,720
No, Yesha.

479
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,054
Bossing will take care of it.

480
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,973
You will visit again.

481
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,057
Won't she, Bossing?

482
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,225
You think this is a mall?

483
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,977
Bossing…

484
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,896
do you promise?

485
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,568
Cross my heart. Go on, get going.

486
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,654
Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go!

487
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,450
Hold on!

488
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,827
- Papa.
- Yesha!

489
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:58,870
Yesha.

490
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,585
Why are you kissing me so much?

491
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,838
So you'll have spare kisses while I’m away!

492
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:12,841
Yesha!

493
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,389
That's enough. We should go.

494
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:19,932
Buh-bye!

495
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:25,395
Wait, wait.

496
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,899
- Wait, take this with you.
- Thank you, sir.

497
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,902
Goodbye, Papa.

498
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:32,694
Goodbye, Yesha!

499
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:34,738
Bye, Yesha!

500
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,254
Jesus! Jesus! Here we go.

501
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,590
Wait! Wait for us!

502
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:55,926
Geez, wait for us!

503
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,933
Wait.

504
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,103
What are we going to do about this?

505
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,564
Hold your horses. I'm thinking.

506
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,902
Trouble is it's easier to smuggle something in than out.

507
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,654
You are not helping.

508
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,157
Yesha…

509
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,450
Papa…

510
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,828
I'm hungry.

511
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:22,954
Son of a…

512
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,747
Hold on a second, just hold on.

513
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,499
What a hassle.

514
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,042
Okay, here.

515
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,755
Thank you.

516
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,092
Papa, let's share it.

517
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,010
It's fine. Papa's full, Yesha.

518
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,887
Go on, eat up.

519
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,430
Have a little picnic, no problem.

520
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,140
Thank you.

521
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,776
Damn, you let out a big one.

522
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,949
You've got to poop, Yesha?

523
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,452
You need to use the toilet.

524
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,829
She needs to poop.

525
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,330
She says she has to poop.

526
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,293
Don't you worry.

527
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,504
Pretty soon there will be visitors coming in again.

528
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,593
Performers, Born Again devotees
with their prayer meetings.

529
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,887
We will look out for it.

530
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,015
That's our chance to get Yesha out.

531
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,435
That's great, Choi. You really are a genius.

532
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,770
Probably why you're such a good swindler.

533
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,398
You've got a mouth on you, old man.

534
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,568
You're the one who hit it big with your fake insurance.

535
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,575
I found this in the trash.

536
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,412
Schedule.

537
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,497
Like I said!

538
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,499
When's the next one?

539
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,293
When does it say?

540
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,128
You read it.

541
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,212
Celso.

542
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,964
Figure it out.

543
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,342
Clean that up.

544
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,052
I want it done properly.

545
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,887
Hurry, hurry up.

546
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,419
Go to sleep! It's lights out.

547
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,600
Goodnight, my love.

548
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,898
Papa, is it my fault you're in here.

549
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,108
Go to sleep.

550
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,904
No, Yesha has no part in this.

551
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:09,412
I just wanted that Sailor Moon bag so badly.

552
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,330
No.

553
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,377
When I get out, I'll buy you that bag.

554
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,180
Wow.

555
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,225
Goodnight, everyone.

556
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,022
Goodnight, Papa.

557
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,942
Goodnight, Yesha.

558
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,162
What is this? What happened?

559
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,207
What happened, why does she have clothes on?

560
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,125
Who did this?

561
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,587
She was just wearing undies, mister!

562
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,424
Come on, Yesha… erase this drawing!

563
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,760
I transformed her to Sailor Moon!

564
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:48,552
What is that?

565
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,721
Sailor Moon! Yesha's favorite!

566
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,181
Watch me!

567
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,894
For Love and Justice, a sailor-suited
pretty soldier, Sailor Moon!

568
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,964
Hey! What's that noise?!

569
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,811
I thought I heard a female's voice.

570
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,646
Did you bring in a woman in here?

571
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,564
No way, Chief.

572
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,525
I'm watching you. Don't pull a fast one on me.

573
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,694
Sorry, Chief. We were just…

574
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,031
I've been trying to get him to stop.

575
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,874
A sailor…Sailor Moon!

576
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,894
You always pull this gay shit! Dammit!

577
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,188
I don't want to hear about you
being all up in one another.

578
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,566
Chief, chief. He was teaching me how to--

579
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,736
so when I get out, I can teach my kid.

580
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,654
What was that? How does it go?

581
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:47,630
Cut it out! If I catch you doing something weird.

582
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,100
- Show me again?
- There. Just like that.

583
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,407
Sir, have you chosen the pictures
we'll post on the bulletin board?

584
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:32,174
How about we put her in a basket
and throw her over the fence?

585
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,635
Don't pick on the kid.

586
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,303
She's a troublemaker!

587
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,723
I'm sorry, sir.

588
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,352
I don't mean to be a bother.

589
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:48,065
I just want to be with my father.

590
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,235
Don't you like having me around?

591
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,446
Don't worry about it.

592
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,285
Thank you, mister.

593
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,204
That's right. We won't get caught
if we just calm down.

594
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,539
Do nothing. Just relax.

595
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,499
Thanks, mister.

596
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,272
Shh. Someone's coming.

597
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,455
Sir.

598
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,248
Routine inspection.

599
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,667
Why start here?

600
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,045
Do the others, too. This is unfair.

601
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,130
Why are you singling us out?

602
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:01,930
Sir.

603
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,391
Sir.

604
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,990
Because you are the only ones hiding something.

605
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:30,626
Boneheads.

606
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,795
What kind of inspections were you carrying out?

607
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,839
Sir, I had my suspicions.

608
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,466
Then you're an even bigger moron.

609
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,385
You had your suspicions but you didn't investigate.

610
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,805
Sir, I wasn't assigned to their building.

611
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,932
You are assigned to every inmate in this prison.

612
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,684
I will have you both sacked!

613
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,854
I want every cell searched thoroughly!

614
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,065
Get to it!

615
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:54,900
Yesha...

616
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,692
Yesha...
- Get in there!

617
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,321
You have no right to be a father.

618
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,156
You have no right to be a father.

619
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,701
You murdered and raped an innocent child.

620
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,120
I didn't do it.

621
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,542
I didn't do anything wrong. I killed no one.

622
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,376
I didn't do anything wrong. I killed no one.
- Damn you!

623
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,671
You're not human. You are going to rot in here.

624
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,425
Out of your cells!

625
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,095
Everyone out if you don't want to get thrown in solitary!

626
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,930
We should confess.

627
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,224
Whatever happens, nobody talks.

628
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,267
But why?

629
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,018
We are going to hang for it.

630
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,562
We've already stuck our necks out.

631
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,356
Let's confess. If we do, we'll get off easy.

632
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,941
He's right, boss.

633
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,236
Who got caught with drugs?

634
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,863
It was a kid.

635
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:41,572
What?

636
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,991
Somebody sneaked their kid in here.

637
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,245
Damn it.

638
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:56,295
Quickly! Search every corner!

639
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,588
Faster!

640
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:09,224
Twinkle... twinkle... little star

641
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:16,940
How I wonder what you are...

642
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,788
Take good care of my Yesha.

643
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,460
She's afraid of thunder and lightning.

644
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,135
Why is that one still awake?

645
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,890
Tell her to get over it.

646
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,227
She might wake up the others.

647
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,105
Understood, sister.

648
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,941
Leave it to me.

649
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,079
Yesha...

650
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,665
Please stop crying, dear.

651
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,919
You should sleep.

652
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:31,348
I wish I could spend every second with you

653
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:40,774
I hope you feel the warmth of my love

654
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,360
Don't cry, Yesha.

655
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,005
Fire!

656
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,548
Open it quick!

657
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,758
Don't come any closer!

658
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,635
I will finish this place!

659
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,387
I will finish this place!

660
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,638
I will burn this place down!

661
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,434
Boss Johnny, there's a fire!

662
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,561
What? Where?

663
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,981
Ring the fire alarm!

664
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,199
Get them out.

665
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,285
Pancho.

666
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,329
Pancho, let's talk. Put that down.

667
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,997
Warden, don’t you come near me.

668
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,915
You will die here, too.

669
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,751
Pancho, what's the problem?

670
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,294
Tell me. I'll see what I can do.

671
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,343
I had to start a fire to get your attention?

672
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,385
I'm listening, Pancho.

673
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,930
I am asking you, for the sake of everyone, to stop this.

674
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,057
Listen to him, Pancho.

675
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,695
You let Joselito's kid visit him

676
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,364
And I'm not even allowed visitors!

677
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,407
Nobody's holding your visitation privileges, Pancho.

678
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,159
You're allowed visitors.

679
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,705
That's not true, my father won't let me just rot in here.

680
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,248
Let's call him right now.

681
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,750
Let's call him.

682
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,126
Go on, Pancho.

683
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,508
Wait, Joselito's not with us.

684
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,802
Chief, where's Joselito?

685
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,553
Joselito's not with us!

686
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,472
What's happening?!

687
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,142
Fire!

688
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,435
Fire!

689
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,399
We are all going down!

690
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,650
Pancho!

691
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,862
Let me out! Hey!

692
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:51,947
Let me go!

693
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:52,989
Pancho!

694
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:56,868
Come on, Pancho.

695
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,246
Over here.

696
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,873
Over here, Pancho. Quickly!

697
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,467
Get out!

698
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,510
Quickly!

699
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,279
Johnny!

700
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,781
It's sir Johnny! He needs help!

701
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,575
Somebody help!

702
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,163
Sir Johnny!

703
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,998
Sir Johnny!

704
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,718
You lost consciousness.

705
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,137
You inhaled a lot of smoke.

706
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,807
Good thing somebody got to you on time.

707
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,601
If he hadn't, you might not have made it.

708
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:04,895
Who?

709
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,315
Him.

710
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:15,739
According to the medic,
the man carried you but you got trapped.

711
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:22,329
He kept yelling out for help
so someone came to the rescue.

712
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,624
That's how you got out.

713
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:35,967
The medic told me he's your guy
for the Secretary Yulo case.

714
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,678
What of it?

715
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,472
He was groggy,

716
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,225
kept going on about things.

717
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,230
Saying he didn't kill anybody.

718
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:58,323
Class, for tomorrow, please read Chapter 8. Okay?

719
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,909
Yes, teacher.

720
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,370
Okay, see you tomorrow.

721
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,756
Yesha…

722
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:16,842
How are you?

723
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,804
I noticed you weren't too keen in class today.

724
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,181
And you haven't been eating.

725
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,934
Things are not fine, miss.

726
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,854
Why? What's the matter?

727
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:34,568
I want to see my Papa.

728
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,031
I also need to see your father and speak with him.

729
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,242
Let's go see him!

730
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,371
Here's your ID.

731
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,622
Thank you, mister.

732
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,671
This is where my Papa lives!
Come in.

733
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,817
There are your visitors.

734
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,245
Papa!

735
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,705
Yesha!

736
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,248
Yesha!

737
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,839
Yesha…

738
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,383
Why are you--

739
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,260
Why are you so thin?

740
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,970
You're not eating?

741
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,263
Are you?

742
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,057
You're pale, Yesha.

743
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:47,933
You're pale, Yesha.
- Papa.

744
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,476
This is my teacher.

745
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,945
How do you do, ma'am?

746
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:01,905
I'm teacher Marilou, sir.

747
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,490
Hello.

748
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,744
Papa, what happened to you?

749
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,746
It's nothing.

750
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,583
I'll kiss it so the pain goes away!

751
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:23,718
Yesha…promise me you will study hard
so you can be a doctor someday.

752
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:28,223
You should eat a lot so you don't feel weak

753
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,017
and you can think more clearly.

754
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,062
Yes, Papa. Promise you'll do the same?

755
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,359
- I will eat a lot as well.
- Visiting hours are over.

756
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,412
Yesha, we need to go home now.

757
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:51,955
Come with me.

758
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,501
Five minutes.

759
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,671
No. The others have gone back in.

760
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,463
Hurry up!

761
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,674
Come along, come along.

762
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,092
Five minutes?

763
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,219
Yesha.

764
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,013
Let's go. Come along.

765
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:08,847
Five minutes.

766
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,306
- Papa.
- Yesha.

767
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:16,896
Let's go.

768
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,107
Eat well.

769
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,942
- That's enough.
- Eat a lot.

770
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,402
Papa.

771
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,738
Goodbye!

772
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,699
Will you visit again?

773
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,659
I'll be back.

774
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,923
Celso, go check on Lito.

775
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:51,681
Lito…

776
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,433
boss Sol wants to talk to you.

777
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,396
I wonder what my Yesha is doing?

778
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,778
Don't worry. Somebody is looking after her.

779
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,572
Boss Sol called for you.

780
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,200
Forgive me for troubling you with this, deputy.

781
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,578
Yesha has no other relatives.

782
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,539
I didn't know who else to call.

783
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,710
I am glad you called me.

784
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,463
You see, we ran into a problem.

785
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,381
We are moving to a new place.

786
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:31,554
If Yesha does not get adopted or find foster parents,

787
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,057
she will have to move with us to the province.

788
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,521
Yesha?

789
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,107
Yesha.

790
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,360
You need to gain your strength back.

791
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,403
So you can go visit your father.

792
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,951
Mister Johnny, I want to steal.

793
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,578
Why would you want to steal? That's bad.

794
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,581
I want to get thrown in jail.

795
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,545
So I can be with my Papa.

796
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,632
Please let me come with you.

797
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,260
I beg you.

798
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,612
Aren't we going to pray?

799
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:46,254
Thank you, God, for our delicious food today and for--

800
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,342
the kind people who are caring for me.

801
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:52,510
Amen.

802
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,471
Go on, eat up.

803
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,099
Have as much as you want, okay?

804
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,227
Egg is good for you. For growing kids like you.

805
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,562
- Let's eat.
- Yesha...

806
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:10,904
When you're ready, we wouldn't mind
if you would call us Mama, Papa...

807
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,198
Mom, Dad, whatever you like.

808
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,534
I was right in my prayers.

809
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,122
Eat some more.

810
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,709
What about you? You should eat, too.

811
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,461
That's okay. Don't mind us.

812
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,926
You need to eat.

813
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,435
You, too.

814
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,187
Oh, my.

815
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,483
- Thank you.
- Is it good?

816
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,651
Yes, very good.

817
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,528
Sir, this is wrong.

818
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:57,575
You've done worse things
but you're still in here because I cover for you.

819
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,202
This is on a different level, sir.

820
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,162
My previous mess-ups were of my own stupidity.

821
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,748
This time we're messing up on purpose

822
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:04,958
I will take responsibility.

823
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,210
Sir, this won't end well for us.

824
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,339
What if we end up losing our retirement benefits?

825
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,424
Then I guess we're doomed to farm sweet potatoes.

826
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,344
I'm not too fond of sweet potatoes, sir.

827
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,972
Just get on board with the plan.

828
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,058
And start getting used to eating sweet potatoes.

829
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,478
Here you go, two sticks.

830
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,146
One sachet from me.

831
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,064
Let's share with that.

832
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:28,940
Sachet of what?

833
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,566
Shampoo.

834
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,110
Bong, here's my share.

835
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,695
Be clear about it next time.

836
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,531
Mine's going to be…

837
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,491
this soap!

838
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,159
Here's my share.

839
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,494
Mine, too?

840
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,413
You want it split with all of us?

841
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,455
Let it go.

842
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,624
This sly old man, wants a share with everything!

843
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,045
That's what I'm talking about.

844
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,006
That's it.

845
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,799
Surprise!

846
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,134
Got you!

847
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,025
Fooling around this early.

848
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,030
Joselito. You have a present.

849
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,157
It's not my birthday yet.

850
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,785
My birthday is on January 18, 1961.

851
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,122
Mama Berta had a difficult time giving birth to me.

852
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,207
- We know!
- We know.

853
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:29,917
Wonder what this is?

854
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,794
I hope it's an air-conditioner.

855
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,339
There are no druglords in here.

856
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:35,882
Maybe an electric fan.

857
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,259
Joselito, it's your mother Berta.

858
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,722
I wish it were Yesha.

859
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,271
- Papa!
- Yesha!

860
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,107
Yesha…

861
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,657
I missed all of you!

862
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,845
Wait here. And don't touch anything.

863
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:41,572
Boss Sol, please read to me.

864
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,703
Ask Grandpa Celso instead.

865
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,498
I'd like you to do it, please.

866
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:03,803
I saw three ducklings

867
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,599
One plump, one lean little ducklings.

868
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:14,480
But only one of them had wings on the back.

869
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,775
It was the leader going

870
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,988
Quack! Quack! Quack!

871
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,407
Quack! Quack! Quack!

872
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,451
Quack! Quack! Quack!

873
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,953
You're making fun of me.

874
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:32,999
My eyes are bad.

875
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,502
He doesn't know how to read.

876
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,090
Come over here.

877
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,847
I've never seen Boss Sol read anything.

878
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:48,890
Let me put on my reading glasses.

879
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,099
Let me put on my reading glasses.
- What are you trying to say?

880
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,810
He can't read!

881
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,689
The story about the friends.

882
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,026
David and Goliath.

883
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,613
Saul made him the captain of all his--

884
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,530
What is this?

885
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,406
A daycare center?

886
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,034
Why do you hate the kid so much?

887
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,285
She's not doing anything to you!

888
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:17,001
I just find it unfair, boss.
Lito can bring his child in here.

889
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:21,797
My wife's pregnant
and I won't even get to hear my kid crying.

890
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,591
Making another kid cry instead, then?

891
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,593
Pull yourself together.

892
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,222
Boss…

893
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,433
maybe you could arrange something.

894
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,978
I could.

895
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,148
Yeah, boss? How?

896
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,152
Commit a crime that lands you a death penalty.

897
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,863
Get a death sentence!
Since you're so jealous of Lito.

898
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:52,620
Boss, all I'm saying is I want to meet my child
and I want him to meet me.

899
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:53,955
Is that such a bad thing?

900
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,292
Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.

901
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,505
Do not touch that.

902
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,645
Your family?

903
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:04,108
Bean pastry for you.

904
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,611
You don't have to give me anything.

905
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,448
I did not let Yesha in for your sake.

906
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,411
I still want to thank you.

907
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,290
Lito.

908
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,631
You're a father, too.
You have a daughter.

909
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:29,967
How could you do it?

910
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,179
Do what?

911
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,767
To kill and rape a child.

912
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,853
I did not do that.

913
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,524
I just went to follow her.
She said there would be a Sailor Moon bag.

914
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,407
Goodbye.

915
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:12,635
Alright.

916
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,681
Do you remember that case
involving Joselito Gopez?

917
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,559
It's hard to forget.

918
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,186
Why is that?

919
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,816
The order that came from above...

920
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,402
is to close the case in a week.

921
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,528
Who are you referring to?

922
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,240
You really need to ask that question?

923
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,618
The victim was Secretary Yulo's daughter.

924
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,788
Give me a copy of Joselito Gopez's casefile.

925
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,748
I cannot do that.

926
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,084
That'll get me in trouble.

927
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,862
Make a copy of this for me.

928
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,948
You know that's not going to happen.

929
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,908
Classified information.

930
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,245
If you don't make me a copy, I will keep this one.

931
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:24,874
Yesha, come play with us!

932
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,292
Yesha, come play with us!
- No running on the stairs!

933
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,626
I'm okay. I'll pass.

934
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,758
Yesha…

935
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,635
Why don't you want to join them?

936
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,639
I don't like running.

937
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,895
Let's play together, the two of us.

938
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,354
Really?

939
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,691
Lucky I have games right here.

940
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,067
Check them out.

941
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,158
Is this a real cellphone?

942
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,827
Or is it a toy?

943
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,580
That's real. It just has games in it, too.

944
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,666
So I can play on it?

945
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,751
Yes. I'll show you.

946
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:11,462
There you go.

947
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,630
Go ahead.

948
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,927
Play for a bit while waiting for your guardian.

949
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:19,595
Thank you, teacher.

950
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,514
I will leave you for a while.

951
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,584
Mister Johnny!

952
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,216
Ba

953
01:08:57,966 --> 01:08:58,758
Ba

954
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,219
Be

955
01:09:01,511 --> 01:09:02,345
Be

956
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:03,556
Bi

957
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,599
Bi

958
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:06,933
Bo

959
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:08,017
Bo

960
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,228
Bu

961
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,105
Bu

962
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,985
Try writing your name.

963
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,779
That sounds hard.

964
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:19,989
Just give it a try.

965
01:09:20,738 --> 01:09:25,869
So…Li…Man.

966
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:39,300
S--So…

967
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:49,934
L-L…

968
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,694
L-L…

969
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:06,035
Iiiii…

970
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,461
Iiii...

971
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,215
Iiiii!

972
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,765
M-m…

973
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:32,061
Christ! Wake me up when it's finally over!

974
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,155
A-a…

975
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,032
A-a-a…

976
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:49,995
A-a…

977
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:57,127
N-n…

978
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,046
N-n…

979
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,552
You got it!

980
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,349
You're amazing!

981
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:13,602
Now write mine. Write my name.

982
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,269
Alright, good idea.

983
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:15,521
Yours is hard to write!

984
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,064
It's just Choi.

985
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,816
Choi. C… H…

986
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,401
This sucks!

987
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:21,902
What's the matter, Bong?

988
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,696
Pissed at the world again?

989
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,364
I still haven't got visitors?

990
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,950
You said your wife was due.

991
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,244
Maybe she already gave birth
that’s why she couldn't make it.

992
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:34,039
Oh, did you want to talk to your wife, sir?

993
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,041
Where?

994
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:36,959
In my dreams?

995
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:38,752
Chrissakes.

996
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:42,923
Here, use this.

997
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,384
- Hey!
- A cellphone!

998
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:47,970
Does this thing work?

999
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,179
Where did you get this?

1000
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,598
It's my teacher's. I forgot to give it back.

1001
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,062
Wait, wait, wait.

1002
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,648
It's ringing.

1003
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,567
It's ringing.

1004
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,694
It's stronger here.

1005
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,947
It got weak. It's getting weaker.

1006
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,200
- Try here.
- Go near the window.

1007
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,744
The signal is strong at the window.

1008
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,579
Hello? Hello?

1009
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,538
Honey?

1010
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,081
Honey?
- You keep saying hello. Who is this?

1011
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,833
Honey!

1012
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,209
Honey!

1013
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,670
Bong, what took you so long?

1014
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,256
Honey, yeah it's me. How are you?
How are you doing?

1015
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:25,924
I've given birth.

1016
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,509
You have? You've given birth.

1017
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:33,891
Shh. Hello? Did it hurt so much? Honey?

1018
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,603
I chose a normal delivery. I didn't want a C-section.

1019
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,189
Honey, honey, what's our baby, hmm?

1020
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:40,731
Tell me?

1021
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:41,899
G-g-g…

1022
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,734
- Gay?
- No signal!

1023
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:45,527
Signal! Signal!

1024
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,071
Hello? Hello? Honey, honey!

1025
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:47,821
What is our baby?

1026
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:48,906
It's a girl!

1027
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:49,573
Girl! Girl!

1028
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:50,574
Girl! Girl!

1029
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:52,493
Girl! Girl!

1030
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:53,994
What do you want to name her?

1031
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,704
She's asking for a name. Give me a name, a name.

1032
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:56,371
Uh…

1033
01:12:56,955 --> 01:13:00,292
Honey, uh..R-ro.. Rose Grazella. Is that good?

1034
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,086
Hm? Honey?

1035
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,672
Honey, could you place the phone
near the baby's ear, please

1036
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,135
My darling? Baby Rose? This is Papa.

1037
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,514
Yes, forgive me, okay?

1038
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,225
I'm sorry I can't be there right now, alright.

1039
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,020
Coo, no, I'm not there.

1040
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,190
But I want you to know this, listen closely, okay.

1041
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:27,027
Papa loves you very, very much, okay? Yes?

1042
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:32,825
My baby, always remember that.

1043
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,913
The signal's gone.

1044
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,415
Hey!

1045
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,211
What the hell.
You didn't flush it.

1046
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,337
Oh, I'm sorry.

1047
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,380
It's you old man!

1048
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,631
Where is the kid? Where's that darned kid?

1049
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,552
Yesha? Yesha, yes. Thank you!

1050
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,095
Thank you!

1051
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,888
Thank you so much!

1052
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,809
What did I tell you? She's heaven sent!

1053
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,645
My Yesha's amazing!

1054
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,107
We'll get to eat nutritious food now.

1055
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,025
Excuse me, Mambo.

1056
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:08,235
There we go.

1057
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:12,698
Are you feeling better?

1058
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:15,200
I'm great! Fantastic!

1059
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,703
Man, I'm jealous.

1060
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,496
I kind of miss my kid too.

1061
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,957
Huh? You have a kid?

1062
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,210
I do! I have a boy.

1063
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,755
I have three wives that's why I ended up here.

1064
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,590
What?

1065
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,592
How about that.

1066
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,887
No matter, I'll make it up to him when I get out.

1067
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,264
Me too, when I get out

1068
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,808
I will make up for lost time.

1069
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,394
Same here.

1070
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:47,191
You know, Joselito…

1071
01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:50,152
you're a good father.

1072
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,118
Hey, Gopez.

1073
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:00,662
Your hearing schedule's set for next week.

1074
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:01,955
Are you ready?

1075
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:03,916
I'm game.

1076
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,084
Hey, this is serious.

1077
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:15,886
Lito, we need to talk.

1078
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:21,516
Think very carefully.
Something is not right.

1079
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,518
Something is missing.

1080
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,813
How was she positioned on the pavement?

1081
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,316
She was lying on her back like she was sleeping.

1082
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,693
When he got here, the child was already on the floor.

1083
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,281
And nobody could have gotten near her.

1084
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,993
How did she slip?

1085
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:42,788
Watch it!

1086
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:46,959
When a person falls, the arms
will break the fall automatically.

1087
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,920
But why did the kid fall back head first?

1088
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,590
Something to do with the weight of her bag?

1089
01:15:58,512 --> 01:15:59,388
Ouch!

1090
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,390
Right! You hit the back of the head.

1091
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,141
When did the incident happen?

1092
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:08,188
It was February 27 because I got my pay that day.

1093
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:10,899
Boss, boss. The twenty-seventh. February.

1094
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,735
My niece's wedding. I had a visit at the time, remember?

1095
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,989
They told me the bride slipped because it was raining.

1096
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,991
The pavement was slippery because it was raining.

1097
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:20,742
But wait, wait.

1098
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:22,828
How did she get a bump on her forehead?

1099
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,204
Where did the rock come from?

1100
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,290
Here, let's try this. We might--

1101
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:26,832
Not that!

1102
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:28,166
Not that!

1103
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,334
What are you going to do?

1104
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,421
Bossing! Bossing!

1105
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:32,963
Wait a minute!

1106
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:34,381
There.

1107
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:36,174
Right.

1108
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,845
The girl slipped because it was raining
and something hit her on the head.

1109
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,764
They will ask you for certain -

1110
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:44,808
Why did you undress the child?

1111
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:50,105
I didn't. I just opened up the button
of her pants so she can breathe more freely.

1112
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,274
They said you were strangling her.

1113
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,401
That's not what it was.

1114
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,487
I was doing this on the chest. Like this.

1115
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:58,572
Compression?

1116
01:16:58,613 --> 01:16:59,114
Yes.

1117
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,491
They said you kissed her.

1118
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:02,951
No.

1119
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,872
Mouth to mouth.

1120
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:07,956
Mouth to mouth?

1121
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:08,999
You know about that?

1122
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,500
Where did you learn to do CPR?

1123
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:12,669
28, 29, 30.

1124
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:14,004
Two ventilations.

1125
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:15,589
Pinch, blow, release.

1126
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,800
We have to repeat that
until we reach the five cycles.

1127
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,887
That's right. I believe you.

1128
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,848
Everything you said sounds exactly like CPR.

1129
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,392
The investigators couldn't have missed that.

1130
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,936
Boss, they did.

1131
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,525
That's why the secretary intervened.

1132
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:36,902
That's how it is.

1133
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,279
Lito was rail-roaded.

1134
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,323
They used him as scapegoat.

1135
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,241
This is wrong.

1136
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,998
Thank you for granting me audience, sir.

1137
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,667
What do you need from me?

1138
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,879
It's about the case of Joselito Gopez.

1139
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,464
That case is closed.

1140
01:17:58,673 --> 01:18:07,057
With all due respect, sir. I discovered an error
was made in the investigation of that case.

1141
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,024
As I understand,

1142
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:21,530
your job is to make sure that the sentences
of your prisoners are duly carried out,

1143
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,909
acting as their lawyer is not part of that job.

1144
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:29,955
But sir…

1145
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,958
Have you lost a child?

1146
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,091
Sir, yes, sir.

1147
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:43,218
Then you know!

1148
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,722
You should be the first person to understand
what I am going through.

1149
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:51,351
I understand the anger.

1150
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,812
I feel the hurt.

1151
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:01,862
No words will come close to explaining
the relentlessness of this pain.

1152
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,157
And I know nothing can ever take it away.

1153
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:11,872
But what if our punishments have fallen on the innocent?

1154
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,260
Go, pass the ball. Travel.

1155
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,845
Go ahead.

1156
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:29,764
Wow, you sure are enjoying yourselves.

1157
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,057
Wow, you sure are enjoying yourselves.
- Dribble! Dribble!

1158
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:33,101
Hey! You're soaked!

1159
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,730
Let up a bit. Wipe your sweat off.

1160
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,607
Your shirt is soaked, honey.

1161
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:40,609
Let’s take a picture first.

1162
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,027
Another picture?

1163
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:43,069
Fine, fine. Let her.

1164
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,113
You know I love taking your pictures, don't you?

1165
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,907
It makes your mother so happy
because we are so handsome.

1166
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,992
Okay, picture. Crack a smile.
Smile even though you're smelly.

1167
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:49,784
Give me a smile, honey.

1168
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,536
1…2…3.

1169
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,789
There we go.

1170
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,125
Aw, it's so beautiful.

1171
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:59,252
You, too, hon. You're all sweaty.

1172
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:00,754
Close the gate, son.

1173
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,172
Let's grab something to eat.

1174
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,424
What did I tell you about
letting your sweat dry on your back.

1175
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,302
I'm telling you, you might get sick.

1176
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,513
You're drenched in sweat!

1177
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,140
This is the only time I get to exercise at home.

1178
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:14,351
You smell good!

1179
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,560
See, what did I tell you?

1180
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:24,194
Junjun!

1181
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,447
Junjun!

1182
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,247
We will say nothing but the truth.

1183
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:19,374
We have known the truth for a long time.

1184
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,794
We just never had the chance to tell it.

1185
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:27,465
You kidnapped the victim to get back to her father

1186
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,468
who beat you up at the mall. Am I right?

1187
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:34,431
I followed the little girl

1188
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,058
because of the Sailor Moon bag.

1189
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,185
That's not what we wrote.

1190
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,524
Papa, please focus on what they prepared for you.

1191
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:54,909
Jenny said, she will show me
where I can buy a Sailor Moon bag,

1192
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,370
that is why I followed her.

1193
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,331
You undressed the victim

1194
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,500
so you could molest her.

1195
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:07,047
No, I removed her button so she could breathe!

1196
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:09,257
Did you really hit her on the head?

1197
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,885
No. She slipped.

1198
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:15,764
Hey! How could you tell?
Did you see her actually slip?

1199
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,726
No. I saw her lying on the pavement.

1200
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,064
Yes. Think about your answers.

1201
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,692
What will you say if you can't remember some details?

1202
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,612
"I can't remember."

1203
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,494
Flush it when you're done.

1204
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,542
I did the CPR.

1205
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:54,219
- I did the CPR.
- Lito, get some rest.

1206
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:27,460
Your Honor, I have an intellectual disability.

1207
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:31,214
The investigator beat me up.

1208
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:39,639
He gave me a document
to sign my name and thumb mark.

1209
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:44,978
They promised they will give Yesha
a Sailor Moon bag so I agreed.

1210
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:52,610
But I do not know what is in the paper that I signed.

1211
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:06,124
Lito, Lito. There's a lawyer who wants to talk to you.

1212
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,169
Do you understand your case?

1213
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:10,795
What case?

1214
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,299
The rape and murder of the kid.

1215
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,051
Do you know who her father is?

1216
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,180
He's a bad man. He punches people.

1217
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,225
Joselito, do you understand what I'm saying?

1218
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,437
That girl you killed was Secretary Yulo's daughter.

1219
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:29,439
Me?

1220
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:30,648
Yes.

1221
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,525
You.

1222
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:34,235
You?

1223
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,365
It's so hard to talk to you.

1224
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:44,579
This case is hopeless.

1225
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,998
I'll be sticking my neck out. No way.

1226
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,584
You're on your own.

1227
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,136
I'm going now.

1228
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,056
Finished talking with Lito?

1229
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:03,848
Yes.

1230
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,350
That was fast.

1231
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,144
I can’t help him.

1232
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:09,979
This might help.

1233
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,148
Have you read his files?

1234
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:13,983
Well, of course.

1235
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,612
Then you should know Gopez
couldn't have come up with those statements?

1236
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:42,303
Lito, remember not to be pressured. Try to relax.

1237
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:46,182
Think hard about what they are asking
before you give an answer, okay?

1238
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:53,690
I want to go home.

1239
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,401
You will be home soon.

1240
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:18,756
Case No. 01 People of the Philippines versus Joselito Gopez

1241
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:22,886
Criminal Case Number 89098

1242
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:29,183
She said she was going to show me
where I can buy a Sailor Moon bag

1243
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:36,024
Jenny said she was going to show me
where I can buy a Sailor Moon bag

1244
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,696
Call the cases.

1245
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:45,491
Listen, you. I know who your daughter is.

1246
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:46,910
Yesha Gopez.

1247
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:56,920
Joselito Gopez.

1248
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,383
On February 27, 1997.

1249
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:09,641
You followed a seven-year old girl, Jennifer Yulo.

1250
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,226
I will make sure that everything
that happened to my daughter

1251
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,229
will happen to yours.

1252
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:17,857
Not my Yesha.

1253
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:20,652
You molested her

1254
01:27:21,152 --> 01:27:23,738
and then you crushed her skull

1255
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,698
using a rock

1256
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:28,534
which was the main cause of her death.

1257
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:34,582
Is that correct?

1258
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:37,126
Joselito, do you understand what I'm saying?

1259
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:41,589
- Why don't you answer so the court could hear.
- That girl you killed was Secretary Yulo's daughter.

1260
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,927
Papa, please focus on what they wrote for you.

1261
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,805
- Is that true...
- I will make sure everything

1262
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:52,350
- that you raped Jennifer Yulo?
- that happened to my daughter, will happen to yours.

1263
01:27:54,185 --> 01:28:00,274
And then you used a rock to crush her skull,
which caused her death...

1264
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,194
- ...only to take vengeance to his father.
- I promise you...

1265
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:04,612
- ...only to take vengeance to his father.
- I will kill your daughter!

1266
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:11,828
Yes, sir.

1267
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,329
Papa!

1268
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:14,872
Papa!

1269
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:20,378
Yes, I am the one who did all those things.

1270
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,213
Lito, why are you saying that?

1271
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:23,673
It's over.

1272
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,092
Tell the truth!

1273
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:26,843
Lito!

1274
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:27,677
Your Honor,

1275
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:31,347
Joselito Gopez has an intellectual disability

1276
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:34,017
This is all wrong. This is not right at all.

1277
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:35,476
I killed her.

1278
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:39,272
- Lito, you are innocent!
- Wherefore, premises considered,

1279
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:43,026
- the court finds the accused, Joselito Gopez,
- Please forgive me.

1280
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,986
 guilty beyond reasonable doubt

1281
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,280
for kidnapping, rape, and murder

1282
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:51,326
Accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of death.

1283
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:52,869
So ordered.

1284
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,540
We are here today

1285
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:01,294
for the new trial of the case of Joselito Gopez

1286
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:04,714
Because of various evidence

1287
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,550
that the previous trial has blatantly ignored.

1288
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:09,427
First of all,

1289
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,764
the official statement of Joselito Gopez
was not read in court

1290
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:17,477
He repeatedly denied every crime he had been accused of

1291
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,772
But the investigator still wrote false statements

1292
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:24,400
And made Joselito sign the document

1293
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,737
According to the investigation,

1294
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,864
Jenny allegedly died

1295
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,658
as a result of a crushed forehead.

1296
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,995
But based on the results of the autopsy,

1297
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,955
the report states that Jenny died from

1298
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:41,167
hitting the back of her head.

1299
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,045
But they stated that,

1300
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,464
Joselito strangled the victim

1301
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,218
But no marks of strangulation
were found on the neck of the victim.

1302
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:52,929
Papa,

1303
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,556
I know how to play the piano.

1304
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,266
Like this.

1305
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:01,562
And this.

1306
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:16,869
My Yesha is so talented.

1307
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:28,548
Papa

1308
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:30,842
I know

1309
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,303
you didn't do a bad thing

1310
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:42,770
Thank you.

1311
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:51,863
Let them have their rest.

1312
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,740
Yes, sir.

1313
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:02,665
Joselito,

1314
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:04,750
visiting hours are over.

1315
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:14,343
Goodbye, Papa.

1316
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:17,930
Goodbye.

1317
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,267
Promise me you will eat well.

1318
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:27,064
Yes, I will. I'll see you again.

1319
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:47,668
Papa!

1320
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,884
1…2…3!

1321
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:01,849
Papa.

1322
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:22,245
Sol.

1323
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,080
Here's a letter for you.

1324
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:26,832
Thank you.

1325
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,003
Y-your

1326
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:36,801
ch-chi-children a-and I…

1327
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,345
Jeez, boss, how many hours are you going to read that?

1328
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:40,137
How are you, Soliman?

1329
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:41,555
Your children and I are in good health.

1330
01:32:41,555 --> 01:32:43,391
Before school starts, we will come visit you.

1331
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,517
You will be surprised to see Junior had gotten so tall.

1332
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:45,434
He's a young man now.

1333
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:46,352
Don't forget to take good care of yourself.

1334
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:47,561
We love you very much.

1335
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:48,271
Thank you, Soliman.

1336
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:49,480
God bless you and your kind heart.

1337
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:50,398
All done!

1338
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:53,484
Papa,

1339
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:55,236
how are you doing?

1340
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,238
I sent this letter

1341
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:59,740
so you will always think of me.

1342
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:02,159
I miss you so much, Papa.

1343
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,745
I am doing fine in my new school.

1344
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,123
I made new friends.

1345
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,667
I will visit you again soon.

1346
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:11,919
I love you very much.

1347
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:17,425
Hey! Look at my daughter.

1348
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:19,552
Baby Grazella is so cute!

1349
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,803
Baby Rose Grazella!

1350
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:22,138
Isn't she cute?

1351
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:23,431
She's so cute.

1352
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,184
She doesn't look like you.

1353
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:29,645
W-what?

1354
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,022
You done with the toilet?

1355
01:33:32,648 --> 01:33:35,401
Are we going to join the talent contest
at the Christmas party?

1356
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,361
Do we have a talent?

1357
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:38,696
We can just sing!

1358
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,197
Sailor Moon!

1359
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:40,906
Right!

1360
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:41,574
Sailor Moon!

1361
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,451
Complete with dance moves!

1362
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:45,161
Five, six, seven, eight!

1363
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:58,591
Ha!

1364
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:00,801
You're all crazy!

1365
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,182
You better not copy our dance moves!

1366
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:16,108
Papa, I have a surprise for you.

1367
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:18,903
Is it a piano?

1368
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:20,446
No, it’s not.

1369
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,573
Surprise!

1370
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:28,329
Impressive!

1371
01:34:30,664 --> 01:34:31,957
My Yesha is so smart!

1372
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:42,968
Do we have a pardon?

1373
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:45,262
No.

1374
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,473
They have set a date.

1375
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,392
December 23rd.

1376
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:51,560
December 23rd?

1377
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,770
It's Christmas time.

1378
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:54,397
Zero considerations?

1379
01:34:59,026 --> 01:34:59,777
That's the word.

1380
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:06,033
They want it over and done with.

1381
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:08,911
They couldn't delay it till after Christmas day?

1382
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:12,123
We should protest.

1383
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:15,292
A forceful nudge from Yulo for sure.

1384
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:18,838
We have folks out there with
death sentences who are still alive.

1385
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:21,215
They're really pushing the guy.

1386
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,342
Poor thing.

1387
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,053
He probably doesn't even realize his days are numbered.

1388
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:30,683
We must do something for both of them.

1389
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:42,361
This.

1390
01:35:43,737 --> 01:35:44,780
This is what we're going to do.

1391
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:47,074
We're going to draw a picture?

1392
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:48,117
What is that?

1393
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:49,160
Is that ice cream?

1394
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:51,162
Oh, you're right…

1395
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,122
That looks like the lollipop I gave Yesha.

1396
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:54,874
No, you idiots.

1397
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,792
Leave it to me.

1398
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:22,610
I'm asking you earnestly.

1399
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:26,447
I'm really sorry, sir.

1400
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:29,408
We still need to get the permission from the principal.

1401
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,870
I'm begging because…

1402
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:37,291
this will be the last time

1403
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:41,629
Yesha gets to be with her father.

1404
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,014
We won't make it.

1405
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,058
We'll just improvise.

1406
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:57,853
Let's weave them all together.

1407
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:01,273
That works. We already have baskets, ropes.

1408
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,024
That should do it.

1409
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,276
What about the helium?

1410
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:05,945
And the materials for the balloon?

1411
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:07,738
Right, what about those?

1412
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:10,449
I need your help.

1413
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,202
What's in it for us?

1414
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,037
Whatever you like.

1415
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,291
Every sale that goes through this building is mine.

1416
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:20,709
All yours.

1417
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,712
I need materials:

1418
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,257
yards of cloth, sewing kit,

1419
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:27,758
and helium.

1420
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:30,261
You got it.

1421
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:49,572
The night is peaceful

1422
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:54,910
All the world is still

1423
01:37:55,536 --> 01:38:00,082
Even the stars

1424
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:05,212
in the dark blue sky

1425
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:09,341
Yesha knows what to do.

1426
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:12,845
- As though it were in love
- Alright, get ready.

1427
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:15,222
- As though it were in love
- Okay, tell 'em.

1428
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:20,144
with the quietness

1429
01:38:20,769 --> 01:38:25,149
of the whole world

1430
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:30,070
A time of peace

1431
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:35,367
is the soul of life

1432
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:40,456
God's blessing

1433
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:45,294
to all mankind

1434
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:50,841
The night is peaceful

1435
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:55,262
All the world is still

1436
01:38:55,971 --> 01:39:00,059
Even the stars

1437
01:39:00,934 --> 01:39:06,315
in the dark blue sky

1438
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,066
Come over here. Hurry.

1439
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:50,609
- Wow!
- Look there!

1440
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:51,402
Come on now.

1441
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:52,403
Lito, Yesha.

1442
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,612
Jump in.

1443
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:56,031
Don't let the others up here.

1444
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:57,491
Lito, come quickly.

1445
01:39:57,991 --> 01:39:59,243
Take care out there.

1446
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,202
Take care of each other.

1447
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:03,997
Take care.

1448
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:05,457
Goodbye

1449
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:07,751
Get inside.

1450
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:09,712
We made that!

1451
01:40:10,045 --> 01:40:10,754
Goodbye!

1452
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:13,298
Goodbye!

1453
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:14,007
No time to waste!

1454
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:16,969
Goodbye!

1455
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:18,762
Goodbye!

1456
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:19,680
Get in. Hurry up.

1457
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,058
- Take care.
- Goodbye everyone!

1458
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:25,227
Get in, get in.

1459
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,398
Papa, are we going home?

1460
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:31,400
We're going home!

1461
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:35,904
Goodbye!

1462
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,283
It's flying! It's flying!

1463
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,751
Oh, shit. Oh shit.

1464
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:49,585
It's stuck.

1465
01:40:51,503 --> 01:40:52,337
Wow.

1466
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:54,965
Wow.

1467
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,134
Yesha.

1468
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:02,973
Remember this moment forever, okay?

1469
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:05,684
I will, Papa.

1470
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:16,904
It's so beautiful.

1471
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:30,375
Bong's wife made this for us.

1472
01:41:42,387 --> 01:41:43,138
There's more!

1473
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:44,181
Check this out.

1474
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:46,934
What could it be?

1475
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:49,561
A cake!

1476
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:58,278
Happy birthday Yesha!

1477
01:41:59,112 --> 01:42:01,448
Blow the candle. Make a wish.

1478
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:08,956
I wish

1479
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:12,501
Papa and I can finally go home.

1480
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:24,221
Yesha,

1481
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,223
we have another surprise for you.

1482
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,811
Wow, she's so pretty!

1483
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:32,229
Thank you so much!

1484
01:42:33,146 --> 01:42:34,565
I also got something for you.

1485
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:37,901
Happy Birthday, Yesha.

1486
01:42:39,194 --> 01:42:40,153
Thank you.

1487
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:42,865
Choi and I got you a few things, too.

1488
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,785
Go on, reach in there.

1489
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:48,871
Go on,

1490
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:51,790
There's so many. Thank you, sirs.

1491
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:54,459
No, Yesha.

1492
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,795
Thank you.

1493
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:58,797
You brightened up our lives.

1494
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,091
Thanks to you

1495
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:03,719
we've gained back hope.

1496
01:43:05,053 --> 01:43:07,764
Thank you for the inspiration

1497
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:10,517
Thank you, Yesha.

1498
01:43:12,185 --> 01:43:12,978
Thank you.

1499
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:21,445
I have a surprise for you.

1500
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:35,083
My Sailor Moon bag!

1501
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:46,136
You fulfilled your promise, Papa.

1502
01:43:46,678 --> 01:43:48,597
Thank you.

1503
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:05,197
You're welcome, Yesha.

1504
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:19,086
What's that for, sir?

1505
01:44:20,712 --> 01:44:23,298
Not much, a souvenir.

1506
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,876
Thank you Boss Sol.

1507
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,768
Thank you, Choi.

1508
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:28,989
Old man.

1509
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:32,701
Thank you.

1510
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,135
Thank you Bong.

1511
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,021
Mambo,

1512
01:46:01,938 --> 01:46:02,731
thank you.

1513
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:06,735
Don't cry.

1514
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:10,238
Goodbye.

1515
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,325
Goodbye.

1516
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:17,496
Goodbye.

1517
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:25,253
Goodbye.

1518
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:52,048
Yesha…

1519
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:57,262
this is where we part.

1520
01:47:58,805 --> 01:47:59,931
But why?

1521
01:48:03,768 --> 01:48:06,646
You cannot follow where I'm going.

1522
01:48:09,774 --> 01:48:10,734
Goodbye.

1523
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:12,611
Don't worry, Papa.

1524
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:16,990
I will do well in school so next time I visit,

1525
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,950
you'll be proud of my high grades.

1526
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:22,454
Do well in school.

1527
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:23,788
and...

1528
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:29,836
eat well, okay?

1529
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:30,837
eat well, okay?
- Yes, Papa.

1530
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:39,763
Papa,

1531
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:42,349
Merry Christmas!

1532
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,145
Merry Christmas.

1533
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:50,774
I didn't get you anything.

1534
01:48:51,858 --> 01:48:52,609
Yes, you did.

1535
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:55,904
You.

1536
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,699
You are your gift to me.

1537
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:03,161
Because you love me very much.

1538
01:49:03,995 --> 01:49:05,121
Papa,

1539
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,875
why are you crying?

1540
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:11,253
Please don't cry.

1541
01:49:13,546 --> 01:49:14,589
Because...

1542
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,927
I love you very much.

1543
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,225
Papa loves you, Yesha.

1544
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:33,692
Goodbye.

1545
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:42,450
Goodbye, Papa.

1546
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:45,453
Bye, Yesha!

1547
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,172
Bye!

1548
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:03,638
One...

1549
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:05,473
two...

1550
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:06,891
three!

1551
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:14,316
One...

1552
01:50:15,483 --> 01:50:16,192
two...

1553
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:17,819
three!

1554
01:50:20,488 --> 01:50:21,614
Papa?

1555
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:25,785
Papa?

1556
01:50:28,496 --> 01:50:29,414
Papa?

1557
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:31,333
Papa?

1558
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,418
Papa?

1559
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:35,503
Papa?

1560
01:50:36,838 --> 01:50:38,048
- Yesha!
- Papa!

1561
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:41,801
- Yesha!
- Papa!

1562
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:47,349
- Yesha.
- Papa.

1563
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:51,144
Help me!

1564
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:53,521
Help me!

1565
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:56,399
Help me!

1566
01:50:56,733 --> 01:50:57,859
Sorry!

1567
01:50:58,568 --> 01:50:59,611
Sorry!

1568
01:51:00,403 --> 01:51:01,279
Sorry!

1569
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:04,032
Help me. Yesha!

1570
01:51:04,699 --> 01:51:05,825
Help me! Sorry!

1571
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:08,661
Help me! Sorry!
- Papa, I will come back.

1572
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:12,874
- Sorry!
- Please don't cry, Papa.

1573
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:14,918
Sorry.

1574
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,545
Sorry.

1575
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:18,630
Sir Johnny.

1576
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:21,508
Sir Johnny, please.

1577
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:22,842
Sir Johnny.

1578
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:29,099
Yesha!

1579
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,253
I stand before you today,

1580
01:51:58,253 --> 01:52:01,172
not only as Joselito Gopez's lawyer

1581
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:04,759
but also as his daughter.

1582
01:52:06,177 --> 01:52:07,762
In my whole life

1583
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:11,850
I have never met anyone

1584
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,770
as innocent as my father was.

1585
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:19,983
The only fault he had

1586
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:23,194
was that his mind was weak.

1587
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:26,781
He did everything he could--

1588
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:29,826
everything

1589
01:52:31,244 --> 01:52:36,166
to ensure no harm would come to his daughter

1590
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:39,419
even if it meant

1591
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:46,092
sacrificing himself and the truth.

1592
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:48,803
I implore you

1593
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:56,227
to again look closely at the evidence.

1594
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:01,357
Because even if Joselito is gone

1595
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:05,278
It matters that the truth should triumph

1596
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:10,867
for all that remains to him
is the integrity of his character.

1597
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:23,213
And I am certain

1598
01:53:27,091 --> 01:53:29,802
that if he were here with us right now

1599
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:35,350
he would easily choose forgiveness,

1600
01:53:37,268 --> 01:53:39,729
despite all he had to endure.

1601
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:43,942
What he may have lacked in mental capacity

1602
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:49,030
he more than made up for
with goodness of heart

1603
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:56,746
It has been a miracle to witness his life.

1604
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:02,877
He touched each one of us

1605
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:07,340
and changed the way we understand life.

1606
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:18,977
He changed each one of us

1607
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,981
and the way we see our lives.

1608
01:54:25,942 --> 01:54:28,236
The accused, Joselito Gopez -

1609
01:54:28,861 --> 01:54:31,489
due to his intellectual disability,

1610
01:54:32,323 --> 01:54:36,244
due to the forceful manner
by which his statement was taken,

1611
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:41,624
due to evidence ignored by earlier investigations,

1612
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:46,796
the court hereby acquits the accused, Joselito Gopez,
of the offenses as charged

1613
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:48,756
So ordered.

1614
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:10,862
One...

1615
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,241
two...

1616
01:55:19,621 --> 01:55:20,330
three!

1617
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:42,268
Papa.

1618
01:56:03,748 --> 01:56:05,541
Yesha!

1619
01:56:06,376 --> 01:56:07,126
Pa!

1620
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:22,058
Life's better with music.
Makes you happy, right?

1621
01:56:23,142 --> 01:56:24,977
I don't want my Yesha to be sad.

1622
01:56:42,537 --> 01:56:44,163
Goodbye, Yesha!

1623
01:56:45,206 --> 01:56:46,708
Goodbye, Papa!
