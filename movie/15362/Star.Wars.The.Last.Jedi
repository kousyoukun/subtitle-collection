1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,500
很久很久以前 在一个遥远的银河星系....

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
星球大战

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
星球大战

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,500
第八部 最后的绝地武士

5
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:42,300
邪恶的第一军团在最高领袖斯努克的统帅下
摧毁了和平的共和国政府
正在征服整个银河系

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:42,300
只有莱娅公主领导的一小股抵抗组织
自由战士仍在反抗暴政
抵抗组织希望卢克・天行者能归来
点燃胜利的希望

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,300
但第一军团已发现抵抗组织基地
并全速接近中
抵抗组织英雄正在紧急撤离

8
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,190
我们尚未装载完毕
We're not clear yet.

9
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,820
C碉堡还有30组炮塔炮弹没有运上飞船
There are still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker.

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,750
别管弹药了 没时间了 叫所有人登上运输机
Forget the munitions, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transports.

11
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,070
糟糕了
Oh, no.

12
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,270
他们这是在撤退啊 被我们抓个正着
We've caught them in the middle of their evacuation.

13
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,630
最高领袖斯努克亲自下达命令
I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

14
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,470
这是我们一举歼灭抵抗组织的机会
This is where we snuff out the Resistance once and for all.

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
通知卡纳迪舰长 准备好无畏舰
Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought.

16
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,350
焚毁他们基地 破坏他们的运输机 歼灭他们的舰队
Incinerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet.

17
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,750
将军 抵抗组织飞船靠近中 武器与护盾均处于攻击模式中
General, Resistance ship approaching. Guns and shields in attack mode.

18
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,180
一架轻型战斗机
A single light fighter.

19
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,020
来点开心的哔哔声 伙计
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

20
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,270
比这还疯狂的任务 我们都执行过
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

21
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,470
不好意思 达默龙指挥官
Just for the record, Commander Dameron,

22
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,110
这次我同意机器人的看法
I'm with the droid on this one.

23
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,150
感谢您的支持 将军
Thank you for your support, General.

24
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,460
开心的哔哔声
Happy beeps.

25
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,630

This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet,

27
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,670
我给猴斯将军带来了一份紧急公报
I have an urgent communiqué for General Hugs.

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,190
把通话接过来
Patch him through.

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,030
我是第一秩序的赫克斯将军
This is General Hux of the First Order.

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,510
共和国已不复存在
The Republic is no more.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,910
你们的舰队成员都是叛军渣滓和战争罪犯
Your fleet are Rebel scum and war criminals.

32
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,550
告诉你们那位"尊贵"的公主 我们不接受任何和平谈判...
Tell your precious princess there will be no terms,

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,230
不接受任何形式的投降
there will be no surrender.

34
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,430
嗨 我在等猴斯将军
Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,550
我是赫克斯将军 你和你的狐朋狗友们死定了
This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed.

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,790
我们会彻底铲除你们这些银河系的垃圾
We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.

37
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,750
行吧 我继续等着
Okay. I'll hold.

38
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,430
喂?
Hello?

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,310
喂?我还在呢
Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

40
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,790
你能..他听得见我说话么?
Can he hear me?

41
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,180
- 猴斯? C他听得见
- Hugs? - He can.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,590
就是名字里有个斯 骨瘦如柴的那个家伙 他肤色很白的
With an "H." Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.

43
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,070
我听得见你 你听得见我吗?
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

44
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,790
我不能一直在这等着 如果你能联系上他
Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him,

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,150
跟他说 莉亚有条紧急消息给他
tell him Leia has an urgent message for him...

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,590
我觉得他在捉弄你 长官
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,510
跟他母亲有关的
...about his mother.

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,390
开火！
Open fire!

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,030
BB-8 加速
BB-8, punch it!

50
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,310
他奔着无畏舰去了
He's going for the dreadnought.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,110
他这是疯了吧
He's insane.

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,230
哇 真刺激
Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.

53
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,390
现在摧毁那些炮塔
All right, taking out the cannons now.

54

56
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,230
卡纳迪舰长 为什么不炸掉那艘小船?
Captain Canady, why aren't you blasting that puny ship?

57
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,200
那艘船太小 距离太近
That puny ship is too small and at too close range.

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,710
我们本应该五分钟前
We need to scramble our fighters

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,910
就让战斗机起飞
five bloody minutes ago.

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,270
他打不穿我们的护盾
He'll never penetrate our armor.

61
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,230
他根本就没想要打穿我们的护盾
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

62
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,390
他想摧毁咱们飞船表面的炮塔
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,980
还剩一座炮塔
One cannon left.

64
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
好戏开始喽
And here comes the parade.

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,110
耶！我看到他了
Yeah! Yeah, I see him!

66
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,420
不...惨了
No, no, no. Damn it!

67
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,840
BB-8 飞机的武器系统失灵了
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,140
我们得摧毁最后一座炮塔
We gotta take out that last cannon

69
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,390
否则我们的轰炸机就完了
or our bombers are toast.

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,880
看你的了 伙计
Work your magic, buddy.

自动炮塔准备好了么?

准备就绪 长官
Primed and ready, sir.

73
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,470
那还等什么?
What are we waiting for?

74
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,910
开火! 攻击基地!
Fire on the base!

75
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,510
起飞！
Punch it!

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,990
最后一艘运输机升空 撤退完毕
The last transport is in the air. The evacuation is complete.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,220
你成功了 波
You did it, Poe.

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,630
把你的队员们带回来 咱们离开这里
Now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place.

79
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,790
不 将军...
No, General...

80
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,430
我们办得到 我们有机会...
We can do this. We have the chance

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,670
干掉这艘无畏舰
to take out a dreadnought.

82
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,310
这玩意是舰队杀手
These things are fleet killers.

83
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,470
不能放过这次消灭它的机会
We can't let it get away.

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,750
撤出战斗
Disengage now...

85
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,710
指挥官 这是命令
Commander. That is an or...

Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio.

87
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,830
好吧 我尽量 将军
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,140
我看上去很紧张么?
Nervous?

89
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,310
顶住啊 BB-8
Let's go, BB-8.

90
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,590
不成功便成仁！
It's now or never!

91
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,390
干得漂亮！
Yes!

It's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought,

99
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,430

in your performance cannot be overstated.

141
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,830
他们跑不掉的 最高领袖
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

142
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,190
绝对逃不出我们的手掌心
We have them tied on the end of a string.

143
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,350
蕾伊
Rey!

144
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,390
干的好 兄弟
Well done, pal.

145
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,190
"芬恩裸体漏袋"?你说什么?你的芯片烧坏了?
"Finn naked leaking bag"? What? Did you fry a chip?

146
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,270
芬恩 伙计
Finn! Finn, buddy.

147
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,510
真高兴见到你
It's so good to see you.

148
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,710
什么情况 我们..
What? Let's...

149
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,950
我得送你去换件衣服 来吧
We need to get you dressed. Come on.

150
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,340
你肯定有一大堆疑问
You must have a thousand questions.

151
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,790
蕾伊在哪里?
Where's Rey?

152
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,390
天行者大师?
Master Skywalker?

153
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,270
天行者大师?
Master Skywalker?

154
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,550
我来自抵抗组织
I'm from the Resistance.

155
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,590
令妹莉亚派我来的 我们需要您的帮助
Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help.

156
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,030
有人吗?
Hello?

157
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,830
走开
Go away.

158
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,110
楚伊 你怎么会在这里?
Chewie, what are you doing here?

159
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,230
他说你会回来帮我们的
He said you're coming back with us.

160
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,390
你是怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

161
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,230
说来话长 我们先一起登上千年隼号 再告诉你
Long story. We'll tell you on the Falcon.

162
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,790
千年隼号?
Falcon?

163
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,790
等等
Wait.

164
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,030
汉呢?
Where's Han?

165
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,950
果然他们逃不出我们的手掌心 赫克斯将军 非常好
Tied on a string indeed, General Hux. Well done.

166
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,310
抵抗组织很快就会任我们宰割
The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.

167
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,710
谢谢 最高领袖
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

168
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,110
你纳闷 我为什么在这至高的权力中心
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

169
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,630
养了这么一只疯狗?
in such a place of power?

170
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,550
如果把疯狗的弱点善加操控
A cur's weakness, properly manipulated,

171
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,420
就能使之成为一个有力的工具
can be a sharp tool.

172
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,270
你受的伤怎么样了?
How's your wound?

173
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,620
小伤而已 不值一提
It's nothing.

174
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,710
强大的凯洛・伦
The mighty Kylo Ren.

175
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,270
当我找到你的时候
When I found you,

176
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,030
我看到你身上有着所有大师梦寐以求的力量
I saw what all masters live to see.

177
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,080
原始的 尚未驯服的力量
Raw, untamed power.

178
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,670
还有着某种与众不同的特质
And beyond that, something truly special.

179
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,950
那就是你血脉中蕴含的潜能
The potential of your bloodline.

180
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,310
就像你的外祖父达斯・维达一样
A new Vader.

181
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,550
现在 我担心...
Now I fear

182
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
我是不是看走眼了
I was mistaken.

183
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,630
我已将一切奉献给您
I've given everything I have to you.

184
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
奉献给黑暗面
To the dark side.

185
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,070
把那可笑的玩意拿掉
Take that ridiculous thing off.

186
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,030
看看你啊
Yes, there it is.

187
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,870
你身上有太多你父亲的影子了
You have too much of your father's heart in you,

188
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,990
小索罗
young Solo.

189
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,790
我杀了汉・索罗 *【“千年隼号”的船长，星战7中死于其子本・索罗（即本电影的凯洛・伦）之手】
I killed Han Solo.

190
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,870
需要做出抉择的时候 我没有丝毫犹豫
When the moment came, I didn't hesitate.

191
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,590
看看你啊
And look at you,

192
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,990
那件事深深地折磨着你
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

193
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,620
你自乱阵脚
You were unbalanced,

194
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,510
一个连光剑都没拿过的女孩把你给击败了
bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber!

195
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,940
你失败了！
You failed!

196
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,550
天行者还活着
Skywalker lives.

197
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,470
绝地武士团的种子就存在
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

198
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,510
只要绝地武士团尚存
And as long as it does,

199
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,990
银河系就还有希望
hope lives in the galaxy.

200
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,430
我以为消灭这最后希望的人 是你
I thought you would be the one to snuff it out.

201
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,670
唉 你终究比不上维达
Alas, you're no Vader.

202
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,350
你只是个...
You're just a child

203
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,470
戴着面具的孩子罢了
in a mask.

204
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,310
准备好飞船
Prepare my ship.

205
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,030
凯洛・伦身上已不见光明
There's no light left in Kylo Ren.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,590
他只会越来越强大
He's only getting stronger.

207
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,500
第一秩序会在几周内控制所有主要星系
The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks.

208
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,670
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

209
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,430
我们需要重建绝地武士团
We need the Jedi Order back.

210
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,190
我们需要卢克・天行者
We need Luke Skywalker.

211
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,750
你们并不需要卢克・天行者
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

212
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,920
我刚刚说的话你有没有听进去?
Did you hear a word I just said?

213
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,990
你想怎么样?
You think what?

214
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,790
我会拿着一把激光剑登场 然后就击溃整个第一秩序?
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order?

215
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,630
你以为你来这找我 就能改变什么吗？
What did you think was going to happen here?

216
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,750
你以为我会无缘无故...
You think that I came

217
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,030
就来到这银河系最偏远的地方么?
to the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all?

218
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,950
你走吧
Go away.

219
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,310
你不走我就不走
I'm not leaving without you!

220
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,390
小心！
Careful!

221
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,950
你这是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

222
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,470
你是谁?
Who are you?

223
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,430
我知道这个地方
I know this place.

224
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,830
此地始建于几千年之前
Built a thousand generations ago

225
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,910
只为了保存这些
to keep these.

226
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,280
最初的绝地典籍
The original Jedi texts.

227
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,310
它们跟我一样 是绝地教团留下的最后痕迹了
Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion.

228
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,230
你说见过这地方
You've seen this place.

229
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,270
见过这座岛
You've seen this island.

230
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,870
只在梦中见过
Only in dreams.

231
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,870
你究竟是谁?
Who are you?

232
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,270
抵抗组织派我来的
The Resistance sent me.

233
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,630
他们派你来的?
They sent you?

234
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,030
你有什么特别之处?
What's special about you?

235
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,830
- 你的家在哪? C我没有家
- Where are you from? - Nowhere.

236
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,790
- 所有人都有家 C贾库星
- No one's from nowhere. - Jakku.

237
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,750
好吧 那地方的确不值一提
All right, that is pretty much nowhere.

238
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,550
来自不毛之地的蕾伊 你为何来这?
Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?

239
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,750
抵抗组织派我来的
The Resistance sent me.

240
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,030
我们需要你的协助
We need your help.

241
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,190
第一秩序锐不可当
The First Order's become unstoppable.

242
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,000
我问的是 你是为什么而来的？
Why are you here?

243
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,990
我内心深处一直有股力量
Something inside me has always been there.

244
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,310
现在它觉醒了
But now it's awake.

245
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,750
我很害怕
And I'm afraid.

246
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,030
我不知道它是什么
I don't know what it is

247
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,550
也不知道该如何运用它
or what to do with it.

248
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,110
我需要协助
And I need help.

249
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,990
你需要一个导师
You need a teacher.

250
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,220
我教不了你
I can't teach you.

251
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,070
为什么?
Why not?

252
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,390
我观察过你的日常作息 你又不忙
I've seen your daily routine. You're not busy.

253
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,310
我再也不会训练另一代的绝地武士了
I will never train another generation of Jedi.

254
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,950
我是来这座岛等死的
I came to this island to die.

255
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,670
是时候让绝地武士终结了
It's time for the Jedi to end.

256
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,710
为什么?
Why?

257
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,380
莉亚满怀希望 派我来到这里
Leia sent me here with hope.

258
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,390
如果她错了 理应让她知道原因
If she was wrong, she deserves to know why.

259
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,750
我们所有人都应该知道原因
We all do.

260
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,430
- 你降职了 - 什么?等等
- You're demoted. - What? Wait!

261
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,830
- 我们击落了一艘无畏舰啊 - 付出了多大的代价呢?
- We took down a dreadnought. - At what cost?

262
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,710
发动攻击就得一鼓作气
You start an attack, you follow it through.

263
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,470
波 动动脑子
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

264
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,670
有些事情
There are things that you cannot solve

265
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,750
不是跳上X翼战机丢丢炸弹就能解决的
by jumping in an X-wing and blowing something up!

266
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,870
我要你明白这一点
I need you to learn that.

267
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,750
在这次任务中牺牲的都是英雄
There were heroes on that mission.

268
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,390
都是阵亡的英雄
Dead heroes.

269
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,550
成不了领袖
No leaders.

270
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,950
这里真是一片不毛之地
We're really nowhere.

271
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,950
这下蕾伊要如何找到我们?
How's Rey gonna find us now?

272
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,870
隐蔽型双星信标
A cloaked binary beacon.

273
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,550
照亮她的返家之路
To light her way home.

274
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,110
在她回来之前 有什么计划?
All right, so until she gets back, what's the plan?

275
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,070
我们得找个新基地
We need to find a new base.

276
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,270
新的基地必须能够提供充足的电力
One with enough power

277
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,100
以便将求救信号发送给 散布于外环星域的盟友
to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

278
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,790
迫近紧报
Proximity alert!

279
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,070
他们发现我们了
They found us.

280
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,670
这不可能
That's impossible.

281
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,030
那是斯努克的旗舰
That's Snoke's ship.

282
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,590
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

283
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,430
我们能跳到光速吗?
- Can we jump to lightspeed? - We have enough

284
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,840
我们的燃料只够跳一次
fuel resources for just one jump.

285
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,190
那就跳吧 快离开这里
Well, then, do it. We gotta get out of here.

286
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,680
等等
Wait.

287
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,360
他们通过我们的光速撤离轨迹追踪到了我们
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

288
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,630
这是不可能办到的
That's impossible.

289
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,150
对
Yes.

290
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,630
然而他们却做到了
And they've done it.

291
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,830
如果我们用光速跳跃
So if we jump through lightspeed,

292
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,750
他们会再找到我们 到时燃料已耗尽
they'll just find us again and we'll be out of fuel.

293
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,830
我们无路可逃了
They've got us.

294
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,750
还没这么糟 还有办法
Not yet, they don't.

295
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,190
我请求 允许我驾驶X翼战机丢丢炸弹吧
Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up?

296
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,670
批准你的请求
Permission granted.

297
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,310
上将 迂回过去
Admiral, swing us around!

298
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,590
全速后退 旋转护盾
Full astern. Rotate shields!

299
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,790
各就各位 快...
To your stations! Move, move, move!

300
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,670
听我指挥
Follow my lead.

301
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,110
绿色中队前往出发位置
Green Squadron to launch position.

302
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,390
全体起飞
Clear all launch traffic.

303
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,070
不用等我 上飞机后就直接发动
Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!

304
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,190
技术人员 启用限制 补给仅供起飞之用
Technicians, lock down supplies for launch conditions.

305
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,870
快走
Move! Move!

306
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,030
波 你还好吗?
Poe, are you all right?

307
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,390
我们得撤至歼星舰射程之外
We need to get out of range of those Star Destroyers.

308
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,950
我们得什么?
We need to what?

309
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,470
引擎全速向前
Full engines ahead.

310
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,310
撤至歼星舰射程之外 战斗机就会撤退
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the fighters will fall back.

311
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,150
全体船舰 全速前进
All craft, full engines!

312
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,350
将护盾集中于飞船尾部
Concentrate rear shields.

313
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,870
伦 抵抗组织飞船已撤至我们射程范围之外
Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of range.

314
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,590
距离太远 我们无法掩护你
We can't cover you at this distance.

315
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,110
返回舰队
Return to the fleet.

316
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,340
如果连三艘小巡洋舰都炸不掉
What is the point of all this

317
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,910
那我们的追击还有什么意义?
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

318
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,070
它们的飞船比较轻型 速度更快 长官
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

319
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,030
它们甩不掉我们 但能和我们保持一定的距离
They can't lose us, but they can keep at a range

320
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,390
让我们的炮塔无法击穿他们的护盾
where our cannons are ineffective against their shields.

321
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,670
继续密集轰炸
Well, keep up the barrage.

322
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,300
至少提醒了他们 我们还在追击呢
Let's at least remind them that we're still here.

323
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,590
是 长官
Very good, sir.

324
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,150
他们这样消耗燃料 撑不久的
They won't last long burning fuel like this.

325
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,510
摧毁他们只不过是时间问题
It's just a matter of time.

326
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,910
快 大家让开 别挡道
Move! Out of the way, everybody! Give room!

327
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,350
生命体征微弱 但她还有一口气
Life signs are weak, but she's fighting.

328
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,670

R2?
Artoo?

329
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,190

R2
Artoo!

330
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,430
对
Yes.

331
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,950
我知道
Yeah, I know.

332
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,470
这是座神圣的岛屿 注意你的用词
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

333
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,990
老朋友
Old friend.

334
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,670
真希望我能让你明白现在的情况
I wish I could make you understand.

335
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,710
我不会回去的
But I'm not coming back.

336
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,790
什么都无法改变我的心意
Nothing can make me change my mind.

337
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,590
多年前 您在克隆人之战中效忠我的父亲
Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars.

338
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,520
现在他请求您帮助他抵抗帝国的侵略
Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.

339
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,870
很遗憾我无法亲自向您提出家父的请求
I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person...

340
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,230
这招真低级
That was a cheap move.

341
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,030
但我的船舰朝遭受攻击
...but my ship has fallen under attack,

342
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,660
把你带回奥德朗星的任务业已失败
and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

343
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,750
这是我们最危急的时刻
This is our most desperate hour.

344
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,430
帮帮我 欧比-旺・克诺比
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

345
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,750
你是我唯一的希望
You're my only hope.

346
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,830
明日破晓
Tomorrow at dawn.

347
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,880
三堂课
Three lessons.

348
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,630
我会教你绝地武士之道
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

349
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,070
还会告诉你 为什么该终结绝地武士了
and why they need to end.

350
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,560
奥加纳将军
General Organa,

351
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,700
莉亚...
Leia,

352
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,550
仍然昏迷不醒但在逐渐恢复
is unconscious but recovering.

353
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,990
这是唯一一条好消息
That's the only good news I have.

354
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,910
阿克巴上将... 所有的重要领导人 都牺牲了
Admiral Ackbar, all our leadership, they're gone.

355
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,990
莉亚是舰桥上唯一一个生还者
Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge.

356
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,430
天啊...
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

357
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,710
如果她在这里 她会告诉大家打完仗再难过
If she were here, she'd say save your sorrow for after the fight.

358
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,990
为了继续我们的大业
To that end,

359
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,790
关于谁应该代替她继续指挥的问题 已经很清楚了
the chain of command is clear as to who should take her place.

360
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,550
那就是 宁卡号巡洋舰的
Vice Admiral Holdo

361
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,750
霍尔朵中将
of the cruiser Ninka.

362
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,270
谢谢您 指挥官
Thank you, Commander.

363
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,790
我们三艘舰上
Four hundred of us

364
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,470
共有四百人
on three ships.

365
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,590
我们是抵抗组织仅存的成员
We're the very last of the Resistance.

366
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,830
但我们并不孤单
But we're not alone.

367
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,190
在银河系的每个角落
In every corner of the galaxy,

368
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,150
受蹂躏与压迫者都知道我们的符号
the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol,

369
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,190
他们将希望寄托于我们
and they put their hope in it.

370
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,550
我们是点点星火 维系着共和国的复兴之火
We are the spark

371
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,190
这点点星火...
that will light the fire that will restore the Republic.

372
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,710
也就是我们的抵抗组织 必须存续
That spark, this Resistance, must survive.

373
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,870
那是我们的使命
That is our mission.

374
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,630
现在回到你们的岗位
Now, to your stations.

375
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,430
愿原力与我们同在
And may the Force be with us.

376
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,270
那位就是霍尔朵中将?
That's Admiral Holdo?

377
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,310
指挥柴伦行星带之战的那位霍尔朵中将?
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

378
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,950
跟我想象中的不太一样
Not what I expected.

379
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,630
中将? 我是指挥官达默龙
Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron.

380
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,630
以目前燃料消耗的状况 我们能够维持在歼星舰射程之外的
With our current fuel consumption, there's a very limited amount of time

381
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,510
时间非常有限
that we can stay out of range of those Star Destroyers.

382
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,030
感谢你提醒我这个情况
Very kind of you to make me aware.

383
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,430
把燃料预计消耗情况汇报给我
Let's get me those fuel projections.

384
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,830
我们得先甩掉他们 再去找新基地
And we need to shake 'em before we can find a new base, so,

385
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,350
我们有什么计划?
what's our plan?

386
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,310
我们的计划 上尉?
Our plan, captain?

387
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,870
你现在应该不是指挥官吧?
Not commander, right?

388
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,190
莉亚下过的最后一道命令不是将你降级么
Wasn't it Leia's last official act to demote you

389
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,710
因为你的无畏舰计划
for your dreadnought plan

390
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,710
让我们损失了整支轰炸机舰队?
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

391
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,480
上尉 指挥官
"Captain." "Commander."

392
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,670
你想怎么称呼我都行
You can call me whatever you like.

393
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,670
我只想知道现在究竟是怎么回事
I just wanna know what's going on.

394
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,500
你当然想知道
Of course you do.

395
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,990
我了解
I understand.

396
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,510
我对付过不少像你这种的鲁莽飞行员
I've dealt with plenty of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

397
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,030
你意气用事
You're impulsive.

398
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,030
莽撞冒进
Dangerous.

399
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,990
现如今的局势下 我们最要不得的就是你这样的飞行员
And the last thing we need right now.

400
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,950
做好本职工作
So stick to your post and follow my orders.

401
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,870
服从我的命令
Turbolink banks seven and eight

402
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,830
七号及八号涡轮机组因维修停用
are offline due to maintenance.

403
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,870
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

404
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,430
嗨
Hey. Hi.

405
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,430
我在 就是...
Uh, I was... You know, I was just...

406
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,820
你是芬恩
You're Finn!

407
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,990
那个芬恩
The Finn!

408
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,230
- 那个芬恩? C抱歉
- The Finn? - Sorry.

409
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,150
我每天的工作都是和油管打交道
I work behind pipes all day.

410
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,110
不太擅长跟抵抗组织的英雄交谈
Doing talking with Resistance heroes is not my forte.

411
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,470
交...
Doing...

412
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,750
交谈
Doing talking.

413
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,430
我叫萝丝
I'm Rose.

414
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,910
冷静 深呼吸
Breathe.

415
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,110
- 好 C嗯
- Okay. - Yeah.

416
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,750
我不是抵抗组织英雄 不过... 跟你聊天很高兴 萝丝
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero, but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

417
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,750
愿原力与你同在
May the Force be with you.

418
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,030
哇 也愿原力与你同在
Wow. You, too.

419
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,430
好 不过你确实是位英雄
Okay. But you are a hero.

420
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,070
我们听说你逃离了第一秩序的事 还听说了你在弑星者基地的事迹
You left the First Order, what you did on the Starkiller Base...

421
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,710
我妹妹佩琦评价说
When we heard about it, my sister Paige said,

422
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,430
"萝丝 那才是真英雄"
"Rose, that's a real hero."

423
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,150
明辨是非
"Know right from wrong

424
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,830
纵使形势艰巨 也不选择逃避"
"and don't run away when it gets hard," she said.

425
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,270
其实...
You know...

426
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,110
今天早上 有三个人
Just this morning, I've had to stun

427
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,470
想搭逃生舱逃走 我只好打昏他们
three people trying to jump ship in this escape pod.

428
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,710
- 什么? - 他们想逃走
- What? - They were running away.

429
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,220
真不要脸
That's disgraceful.

430
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,310
就是啊
I know.

431
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,310
不管怎么说
Anyway, uh...

432
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,150
我得继续刚刚没做完的事
Gotta get back to what I was doing, so...

433
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,640
你刚刚在做什么?
What were you doing?

434
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,430
额 我在
Uh, just...

435
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,350
- 进行一些检查 C检查逃生舱
- Doing some checks. - Checking the escape pods.

436
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,870
- 不 我这是例行检查  - 你这所谓的检查
- No, it's routine checks. - By boarding one

437
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,030
是带着行李 登上逃生舱吧
with a packed bag.

438
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,750
好啦
Okay.

439
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,910
听我说
Listen, I'm...

440
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,630
我动不了...
I can't move. I can't move.

441
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,670
- 我知道 C这是什么情况?
- I know. - What happened?

442
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,630
我要送你进禁闭室 检举你当逃兵
I'm taking you to the brig and turning you in for desertion.

443
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,940
我不是逃兵
I was not deserting.

444
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,350
- 我跟你说了... C我妹妹为了保护舰队
- I told you that... - My sister just died

445
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,110
牺牲了
protecting the fleet.

446
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,190
而你却想逃跑
And you were running away.

447
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,350
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

448
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,750
但这支舰队在劫难逃
But this fleet is doomed,

449
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,070
要是我朋友回到这儿 她也死定了
and if my friend comes back to it, she's doomed, too.

450
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,510
我得把这个...
I've gotta get this...

451
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,870
我得把这信标带到别的地方
I gotta get this beacon far away from here.

452
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,390
她找到我后 才能平安无事
Then she'll find me and be safe.

453
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,110
你这个自私的叛徒
You're a selfish traitor.

454
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,270
我们甩不掉第一秩序的舰队
Look, we can't outrun the First Order fleet.

455
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,750
我们可以跳到光速
We can jump to lightspeed!

456
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,910
他们能通过光速轨迹追踪到我们
Well, they can track us through lightspeed.

457
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,550
他们能穿过光速追到我们?
They can track us through lightspeed?

458
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,630
对
Yeah.

459
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,710
他们30秒后就会追上我们
They'd just show up thirty seconds later

460
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,790
而我们却耗掉大量燃料
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel,

461
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,990
何况我们燃料严重不足
which, by the way, we're dangerously short on.

462
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,390
他们能通过光速轨迹追踪到我们
They can track us through lightspeed.

463
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,710
对 他们可以...
Yes. And they could...

464
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,230
我牙齿没感觉了
I can't feel my teeth.

465
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,190
你是用什么枪射我的?
What did you shoot me with?

466
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,350
主动追踪器
Active tracking.

467
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,550
你说什么
What now?

468
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,270
超空间追踪是一项新技术
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

469
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,950
其原理与一般的主动追踪器相同
but the principle must be the same as any active tracker.

470
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,670
- 所以他们只是从主舰上... - 也只能从主舰上
- They're only tracking us... - Only tracking us...

471
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,150
追踪我们
...from the lead ship.

472
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,710
但我们找不到追踪器
But we can't get to the tracker.

473
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,910
那是一个A级程序 他们从主舰桥上控制它
It's an A-class process, they'll control it from the main bridge.

474
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,320
不过每个A级程序...
Well, I mean, yes, but every A-class process...

475
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,860
都有一个专门的断电器
...has a dedicated power breaker.

476
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,860
但是...谁知道歼星舰的配电室
But... Wait, but who knows where the breaker room

477
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,950
在哪里
is on a Star Destroyer?

478
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,110
我以前经常在那边拖地
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

479
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,820
如果我们能到那里
If I can get us there,

480
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,150
我就能关闭他们的追踪器
I can shut their tracker down.

481
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,630
再给我简单明了的解释一遍
Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

482
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,110
第一秩序只能从主歼星舰上追踪到我们
So, the First Order's only tracking us from one Destroyer, the lead one.

483
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,350
所以我们去炸掉那艘战舰?
So we blow that one up?

484
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,710
你这个想法很好 但是这样不行
I like where your head's at, but no.

485
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,590
即使炸毁主舰 他们也会从另一艘歼星舰上继续追踪我们
They'd only start tracking us from another Destroyer.

486
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,710
但如果我们能...
But if we can...

487
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,990
如果我们能悄悄登上主舰
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer and disable the tracker

488
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,270
关闭追踪器 那我们...
without them realizing, then we can...

489
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,510
他们在一个系统周期内 无法察觉到追踪器已遭关闭
They won't realize it's off for one system cycle.

490
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,060
- 大约有六分钟的时间 - 偷偷登舰
- About six minutes. - Sneak on board.

491
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,910
关闭追踪器
Disable the tracker.

492
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,510
在他们发觉前 我们的舰队可以逃走
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

493
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,910
你们俩是怎么认识的?
How'd you two meet?

494
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,870
只是运气罢了
Just luck.

495
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,710
是吗?
Yeah?

496
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,220
这算好运么?
Good luck?

497
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,820
目前还不确定
Not sure yet.

498
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,670
波 我们只能这么办
Poe, we gotta do this.

499
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,030
这样既能救舰队 也能救蕾伊
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

500
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,360
看来我要发出这里唯一的理性声音了
If I must be the sole voice of reason,

501
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,510
霍尔朵中将绝对不会同意这个计划
Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.

502
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,310
你说得对 3P0
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

503
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
这计划不能外泄 不必让她知道
It's a "need-to-know" plan, and she doesn't.

504
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,830
- 我不是这个意思... C好吧
- That wasn't exactly my... - All right,

505
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,350
你们俩去关闭追踪器
you guys shut down that tracker.

506
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,990
我在这里让飞船跳至光速
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

507
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,150
问题是...
The question is,

508
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,350
我要如何让你们俩偷偷登上斯努克的歼星舰?
how do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's Destroyer?

509
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,550
我们可以去偷通行码
We steal clearance codes.

510
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,630
不行 那是生物密码 而且每小时变更一次
No, they're bio-hexacrypt and rescrambled every hour.

511
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,120
我们不可能神不知鬼不觉地通过安全护盾
We can't get through their security shields undetected.

512
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,020
没有人能办到
Nobody can.

513
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,390
你问我能不能办到?
Could I do it?

514
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,790
我当然可以 但我现在没办法帮你们
Of course I could do it. But I can't do it.

515
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,830
我现在分身乏术
I'm a little tied down right now.

516
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,190
玛兹 发生什么事?
Maz? What is happening?

517
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,630
联盟闹内讧 你们不会想听这些破事的
Union dispute. You do not want to hear about it.

518
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,470
不过 算你们运气好
But, lucky for you,

519
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,390
正好有个我信任的人 他能破解那种安全机制
there's exactly one guy I trust who can crack that kind of security!

520
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,510
他是解码大师
He's a master codebreaker,

521
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,710
优秀的飞行员 还是个爆能枪高手
an ace pilot, a poet with a blaster.

522
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,310
天啊
Oh, my.

523
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,750
听起来这个解码高手无所不能啊
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow can do everything.

524
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,380
对 没错
Oh, yes, he can.

525
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,750
你们可以去找他 他西服的翻领上有朵红色小花
You'll find him with a red plom bloom on his lapel

526
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,510
他在坎托湾的赌场
rolling at a high stakes table

527
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,870
在赌桌上 尽情豪赌
in the casino on Canto Bight.

528
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,030
坎托湾?不 那是... 玛兹
Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz...

529
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,030
有没有其它可以让我们自己解决问题的办法
Is there any way that we can take care of this ourselves?

530
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,870
抱歉 孩子 这一破解技术极为罕见
Sorry, kiddo. This is rarefied cracking.

531
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,750
你想登上那艘歼星舰
You wanna get on that Destroyer,

532
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,390
我只知道这一个办法
I only know one option.

533
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,430
那就是去找解码大师
Find the Master Codebreaker.

534
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,140
你会带我找到卢克・天行者的
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

535
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,630
这不是你干的 你还没这么强
You're not doing this. The effort would kill you.

536
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,710
你能看见我周围的环境吗?
Can you see my surroundings?

537
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,390
你会为所做的一切付出代价的
You're gonna pay for what you did!

538
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,830
我看不到你的
I can't see yours.

539
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,710
只能看到你
Just you.

540
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,350
所以不对
So, no.

541
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,350
这是 别的东西
This is something else.

542
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,310
卢克
Luke.

543
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,430
怎么回事?
What's that about?

544
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,420
我在擦拭我的爆能枪 不小心走火了
I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.

545
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,620
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

546
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,270
那些人是谁?
Who were those things?

547
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,400
看护者
Caretakers.

548
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,670
岛上的原住民
Island natives.

549
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,220
自打绝地建筑建成后 他们就负责维护
They've kept up the Jedi structures since they were built.

550
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,510
我觉得他们不喜欢我
I don't think they like me.

551
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,350
真想不透是为什么
Can't imagine why.

552
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,640
天行者大师
Master Skywalker,

553
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,300
我们需要你重建绝地武士团
we need you to bring the Jedi back

554
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,270
凯洛・伦所拥有的黑暗原力威力强大
because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force.

555
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,900
要是没有绝地武士 我们不可能击败他
Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him.

556
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,390
你对原力了解多少?
What do you know about the Force?

557
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,750
这是一种绝地武士所拥有的力量 能让其操控别人的心智
It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people

558
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,910
还可以使物体飘浮起来
and make things float.

559
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,990
不错啊
Impressive.

560
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,110
你说的没有一个字是对的
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

561
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,870
第一课 坐在这里 盘腿
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

562
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,790
原力不是你所拥有的力量
The Force is not a power you have.

563
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,270
不是把石头抬起来
It's not about lifting rocks.

564
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,470
而是万物之间的能量
It's the energy between all things,

565
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,710
一种张力 一种平衡
a tension, a balance,

566
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,150
将宇宙凝聚在一起
that binds the universe together.

567
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,310
明白了
Okay.

568
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,620
但原力究竟是怎样的?
But what is it?

569
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,310
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

570
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,590
呼吸
Breathe.

571
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,310
现在...
Now,

572
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,900
开始伸展
reach out.

573
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,710
我有感觉
I feel something.

574
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,830
- 你感觉到了? C对 感觉到了
- You feel it? - Yes, I feel it.

575
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,910
- 那就是原力 C真的吗?
- That's the Force. - Really?

576
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,550
你的原力一定很强烈
Wow, it must be really strong with you.

577
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,710
我从未感觉过任何...
I've never felt any...

578
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,870
噢
Ow!

579
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,940
你说伸出去是指...
You meant reach out like...

580
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,590
我再试一次
I'll try again.

581
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,110
呼吸
Breathe.

582
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,230
呼吸就好
Just breathe.

583
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,630
跟着感觉延伸出去
Reach out with your feelings.

584
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,190
你看见什么?
What do you see?

585
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,270
岛屿
The island.

586
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,230
生命
Life.

587
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,920
死亡与腐朽
Death and decay,

588
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,910
孕育着的新生命
that feeds new life.

589
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,630
温暖
Warmth.

590
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,750
寒冷
Cold.

591
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,430
和平
Peace.

592
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,310
暴力
Violence.

593
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,830
在它们之间呢?
And between it all?

594
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,630
平衡
Balance.

595
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,620
一股能量
An energy.

596
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,270
一股原力
A Force.

597
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,510
在你体内呢?
And inside you?

598
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,270
在我体内...
Inside me

599
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,510
也是这样一股原力
that same Force.

600
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,790
这就是我要教给你的
And this is the lesson.

601
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,070
原力不属于绝地武士
That Force does not belong to the Jedi.

602
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,110
有人说绝地武士死光了 光明就终结了 这是夸大其词
To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity.

603
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,430
你能感觉到吗?
Can you feel that?

604
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,830
有别的东西...
There's something else

605
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,310
在岛屿底下
beneath the island.

606
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,230
一个地方
A place.

607
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,740
黑暗的地方
A dark place.

608
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,990
平衡
Balance.

609
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,590
强大的光明 强大的黑暗
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

610
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,070
好冷
It's cold.

611
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,910
它在呼唤我
It's calling me.

612
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,270
抗拒住它 蕾伊
Resist it, Rey.

613
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,590
蕾伊?
Rey?

614
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,190
蕾伊
Rey!

615
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,830
你直接滑向黑暗面
You went straight to the dark.

616
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,750
那地方想给我看样东西
That place was trying to show me something.

617
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,750
它投你所好
It offered something you needed.

618
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,670
你都没有试着阻止自己倒向黑暗
And you didn't even try to stop yourself.

619
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,430
但我没看见你
But I didn't see you.

620
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,070
完全没有看到你
Nothing from you.

621
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,830
你将自己和原力阻隔开来
You've closed yourself off from the Force.

622
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,750
这也不奇怪了
Of course you have.

623
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,190
这种原始的力量我只见过一次
I've seen this raw strength only once before,

624
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,470
在本・索罗的身上
in Ben Solo.

625
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,350
当时并不足以令我感到害怕
It didn't scare me enough then.

626
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,070
现在却令我感到恐惧
It does now.

627
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,470
那是什么情况?
What was that?

628
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,830
没什么 中将
Nothing, admiral.

629
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,390
太空垃圾而已
Passing debris.

630
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,550
舰队剩下燃料只够用十八个小时
The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left.

631
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,280
我们得动作快点了
We gotta hurry.

632
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,550
还是联系不上抵抗组织?
Still can't reach the Resistance?

633
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,310
继续试
Keep at it.

634
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,150
如果联系上的话 询问一下他们的情况
If you get through, check their status.

635
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,640
问问芬恩情况如何了
And ask about Finn.

636
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,790
原力为何连结着我们?
Why is the Force connecting us?

637
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,150
你和我
You and I.

638
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,710
你这凶残小人
Murderous snake.

639
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,510
太迟了 你输了 我找到天行者了
You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.

640
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,990
他有没有告诉你发生了什么事?
Did he tell you what happened?

641
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,550
那一夜我摧毁了他的圣殿 他有告诉我为什么这么做么?
The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?

642
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,310
关于你的所有情况 我都知道了
I know everything I need to know about you.

643
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,990
是么?
You do?

644
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,470
啊 你是真的知道了
Ah, you do.

645
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,670
你眼中的那种眼神
You have that look in your eyes.

646
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,630
你在那座森林里也是这种眼神
From the forest.

647
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,540
当时你说我是个怪物
When you called me a monster.

648
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,830
你就是个怪物
You are a monster.

649
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,430
对 我是
Yes, I am.

650
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,750
好了
Okay.

651
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,190
我们登陆 找到解码大师 然后离开
We get in, we find this codebreaker, we get out.

652
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,550
你了解坎托湾这个地方么?
You know this town? Canto Bight?

653
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,910
读过关于它的故事
From stories.

654
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,510
那是个糟糕的地方 到处都是银河系的人渣
It's a terrible place filled with the worst people in the galaxy.

655
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,630
真不错
Great.

656
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,510
我跟那两个家伙说了
I told those two, I said,

657
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,350
"这是公共海滩 不能把穿梭机停在这里"
"This is a public beach. You can't park that shuttle here."

658
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,110
他们却朝赌场方向呼啸而去
But they just lit off toward the casino.

659
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,670
下注 下注
Place your bets. Place your bets.

660
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,630
下的注全部放桌上 请下注
All bets on the table right now, right now!

661
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,790
太棒了
Place your bets here.

662
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,550
这地方真不错
Aw, yes! This place is great!

663
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,520
够了
Okay.

664
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,390
玛兹说那个解码大师的西服翻领上有朵红色小花
Maz said this Master Codebreaker would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

665
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,310
我们找到他 然后就走
Let's find him and get out of here.

666
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,510
非常好 庄家获胜
Well played. The house wins.

667
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,790
你有没有素质啊?
Where are your manners, more like?

668
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,950
快点
Come on!

669
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,710
整间赌场都找遍了
We've covered this whole casino.

670
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,790
哪有红色小花
Zero red plom blooms.

671
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,100
那家伙在哪?
Where is this guy?

672
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,950
难道跟我想的一样吗?
Were those what I think they were?

673
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,150
- 那是什么玩意? - 法西骆
- What are those things? - Fathiers.

674
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,590
我没见过真的法西骆
I've never seen a real one.

675
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,920
我觉得这地方真漂亮
Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on.

676
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,310
你为什么这么讨厌它?
Why do you hate it so much?

677
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,550
仔细看
Look closer.

678
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,590
我妹妹和我在贫穷的采矿星系中长大
My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system.

679
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,510
第一秩序抢走我们的矿石 维持军费开支
The First Order stripped our ore to finance their military

680
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,030
还把我们当作测试武器的人肉靶子
then shelled us to test their weapons.

681
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,150
他们夺走我们的一切
They took everything we had.

682
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,040
你觉得这些人是干什么的?
And who do you think these people are?

683
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,950
银河系只有一种行当 能让人这么有钱
There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.

684
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,750
那就是战争
War.

685
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,590
他们把武器卖给第一秩序
Selling weapons to the First Order.

686
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,350
我真希望... 我能一拳打烂这恶心又美丽的城市
I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town.

687
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,830
红色小花
Red plom bloom!

688
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,110
红色小花
Red plom bloom!

689
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,460
解码大师
The Master Codebreaker!

690
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,390
他们就是乱停穿梭机的人
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

691
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,590
好
All right.

692
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,150
你们因违反停车规定27B/6遭到逮捕
You two are under arrest for parking violation 27B/6.

693
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,310
你们有权保持...
You have the right to remain...

694
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,510
C那是什么? - 别别别 美女 先别吵我
- What was that? - No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

695
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,630
我手气正旺呢
I'm on a roll.

696
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,030
第二课
Lesson two.

697
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,390
现在绝地武士几近灭绝 人们把他们想的很浪漫 把他们奉若神明
Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

698
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,630
但如果掀开他们的神秘面纱 观察他们的所作所为
But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds,

699
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,150
绝地武士留下的是失败
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

700
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,620
虚伪 傲慢
Hypocrisy, hubris.

701
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,750
怎么可能
That's not true.

702
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,470
他们在自身力量达到顶峰之时 他们纵容达斯・西迪厄斯 使之得以崛起
At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

703
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,510
促成了帝国的建立 而帝国势力反过来将他们铲除殆尽
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

704
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,830
训练达斯・维达 把他培养出来的
It was a Jedi Master who was responsible

705
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,110
是一位绝地大师
for the training and creation of Darth Vader.

706
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,790
救他的也是一个绝地武士
And a Jedi who saved him.

707
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,030
对 银河系最被痛恨的人
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

708
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,390
但你看到他内心挣扎
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

709
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,190
你相信他还有一丝善念 可以挽救回来的
You believed that he wasn't gone. That he could be turned.

710
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,230
然后我成了一个传奇
And I became a legend.

711
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,750
多年来 始终有种平衡
For many years, there was balance

712
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,310
然后我看到...
and then I saw

713
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,590
本
Ben.

714
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,710
我的外甥
My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood.

715
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,230
身上流淌着天行者的血液
And in my hubris,

716
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,550
傲慢的我
I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths.

717
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,070
以为能训练他 将力量传给他
Han was Han about it, but...

718
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,150
汉倒是无所谓 但是...
Leia

719
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,950
莉亚...
trusted me with her son.

720
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,750
信任我 把儿子交给我
I took him,

721
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,550
我收下他
and a dozen students,

722
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,110
和十来个学生
and began a training temple.

723
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,270
建立了一座训练圣殿
By the time I realized

724
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,590
待我发现自己敌不过他内心滋生的黑暗之时
I was no match for the darkness rising in him,

725
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,750
为时已晚
it was too late.

726
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,430
发生了什么?
What happened?

727
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,350
我与他当面对峙
I went to confront him.

728
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,310
他攻击了我
And he turned on me.

729
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,190
本 不！
Ben, no!

730
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,430
他肯定以为我死了
He must have thought I was dead.

731
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,340
等我醒来
When I came to,

732
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,110
发现圣殿失火燃烧着
the temple was burning.

733
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,230
他与我的其中几位学生失去了踪影
He had vanished with a handful of my students.

734
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,510
剩下的惨遭屠杀
And slaughtered the rest.

735
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,950
莉亚认为是斯努克的错
Leia blamed Snoke,

736
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,860
但是应该怪我
but it was me.

737
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,990
我失败了
I failed.

738
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,550
因为我是卢克・天行者
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

739
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,390
绝地大师
Jedi Master.

740
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,390
一个传奇
A legend.

741
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,870
银河系或许需要一个传奇
The galaxy may need a legend.

742
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,750
我需要有人告诉我 我在这一切中究竟扮演了什么样的角色
I need someone to show me my place in all this.

743
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,310
你并没有辜负凯洛
And you didn't fail Kylo.

744
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,150
是凯洛辜负你
Kylo failed you.

745
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,550
我不会辜负你
I won't.

746
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,070
主航舰仍在射程外
The main cruiser's still keeping beyond range.

747
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,390
但他们的医疗护卫舰燃料用尽
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

748
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,270
护盾失效
and its shields are down.

749
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,310
他们的末日到来了
The beginning of their end.

750
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,550
歼灭它
Destroy it.

751
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,910
我们最后组员已撤退 往你们方向前进
The last of our crew has been evacuated and heading your way.

752
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,590
很荣幸为您效力 中将
It's been an honor, admiral.

753
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,630
天佑义军！
Godspeed, Rebels!

754
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,030
中将
Admiral,

755
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,710
我们剩下的燃料还能使用六个小时
fuel reserves at six hours.

756
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,550
维持目前航线
Maintain our current course.

757
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,070
稳定前进
Steady on.

758
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,150
芬恩
Finn,

759
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,430
萝丝 你们在哪里?
Rose, where are you guys?

760
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,940
算我一个
Deal me in.

761
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,070
谢谢
Thanks.

762
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,230
芬恩 舰队燃料即将耗尽
Finn, the fleet is running on fumes.

763
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,870
如果无法获得解码大师的帮助 我们无法登上歼星舰
Without a codebreaker to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

764
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,670
- 那怎么办? C我不知道
- What do we do? - I don't know.

765
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,830
除非这里有个窃贼能把锁弄开 否则计划就泡汤了
Unless you got a thief in your pocket, our plan is shot.

766
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,240
我有办法
Um, I can do it.

767
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,390
什么?
What?

768
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,190
什么?
What?

769
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,150
什么?
What?

770
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,910
抱歉
S-S-Sorry, I just

771
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,350
虽然我不想偷听你们
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

772
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,390
但你们说话声音很大
that you were saying really loudly

773
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,430
我正准备睡觉呢
while I was trying to sleep.

774
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,030
解码大师?
Codebreaker?

775
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,430
窃贼?
Thief?

776
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,590
我做得到
I can do it.

777
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,510
我们讲的不是偷钱包 好吗?
We're not talking about picking pockets, okay?

778
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,470
对啦
Yeah.

779
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,390
不要以貌取人 朋友
D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend.

780
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,630
我很熟悉第一秩序的安全密码系统
Me and the First Order codeage go way back.

781
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,590
而且...
And,

782
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,190
如果价格合理
if the price is right,

783
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,350
我还能让你们进入斯努克的卧室呢
I could break you into old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

784
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,030
- 不用 C 我们自己搞定
- No. - We're... We got it covered.

785
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,950
靠
Ha-tuk-ga.

786
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,190
- 他是不是刚刚... C对
- Did he just... - Yeah.

787
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,390
我们快走 这边
We gotta get out of here! This way!

788
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,630
你这个小...
Why you little...

789
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,550
是你干的吗?
D-D-Did you do this?

790
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,710
手举高
Hey, hands up!

791
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,110
- 手举高 - 举了
- Hands up! - Yeah, man.

792
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,830
你是何方神圣 圆家伙?
What's your story, roundie?

793
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,630
他们朝这边逃了
They went this way!

794
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,390
- 封锁所有出口 - 等等
- Lock down all the exits. - Wait.

795
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,550
这味道简直了
That smelled great.

796
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,550
那些警察随时会追上来 现在怎么办?
Those cops will be here any minute. What now?

797
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,590
等等 拜托 不要
No, wait. Please, don't!

798
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,220
我们是抵抗组织的
We're with the Resistance.

799
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,190
收到 正在搜索马厩
Roger that. Checking the stables now.

800
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,110
这边
This way.

801
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,190
他们肯定来过这里
They must have come through here.

802
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,230
快 快跑
Go, go, go! Whoo!

803
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,680
这没什么爽的 不用爽成这样
Stop enjoying this! Stop enjoying this!

804
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,550
追上他们了 他们插翅难飞
We've got them. They're not going anywhere.

805
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,430
快走...让开
Move, move, move! Get out of the way!

806
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,510
我们的飞船在正前方的海滩上
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

807
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,510
我们需要掩护
We need cover!

808
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,670
太多掩护了
Too much cover!

809
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,310
飞船在那!
There it is!

810
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,830
- 不！ - 不会吧
- No! - Come on!

811
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,870
别管马群 跟紧罪犯
Let the herd go. Stick with the perps.

812
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,670
他们去哪了?
Where'd they go?

813
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,990
应该甩掉他们了
I think we lost him!

814
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,790
我们现在下山去海滩 再绕回来...
Now we get down to the beach and circle back around...

815
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,990
悬崖！
Cliff!

816
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,190
我们困住了
We're trapped.

817
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,350
不过很值得
It was worth it, though.

818
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,270
在城市中搞了点破坏
To tear up that town,

819
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,860
让他们受到损失
make 'em hurt.

820
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,470
走吧
Go.

821
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,740
真是值了
Now it's worth it.

822
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,030
发现他们了
There they are.

823
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,190
BB-8 你在驾驶那飞船?
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

824
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,910
需要载你们一程吗?
N-N-Need a lift?

825
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,790
卢克
Luke.

826
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,260
莉亚
Leia.

827
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,990
我现在不想跟你谈
I'd rather not do this now.

828
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,030
我也是这么想的
Yeah, me, too.

829
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,990
你为什么恨你父亲?
Why did you hate your father?

830
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,430
你能穿点东西么
Do you have something,

831
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,910
斗篷之类都行
a cowl or something you could put on?

832
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,990
你为什么恨你父亲?老实回答我
Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer.

833
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,110
你有一个爱你的父亲 他非常关心你
You had a father who loved you, he gave a damn about you.

834
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,350
- 我不恨他 - 那是为什么?
- I didn't hate him. - Then why?

835
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,750
什么为什么?
Why what?

836
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,710
什么为什么? 说啊
Why what? Say it.

837
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,360
你为什么...
Why did you...

838
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,110
你为什么杀了他?
Why did you kill him?

839
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,750
我不懂你为什么这么做
I don't understand.

840
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,910
不懂?
No?

841
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,670
你父母把你当垃圾一样抛弃
Your parents threw you away like garbage.

842
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,950
- 他们没有 C有
- They didn't! - They did.

843
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,910
但你就是需要长辈的关爱
But you can't stop needing them.

844
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,300
这是你最大的弱点
It's your greatest weakness.

845
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,230
四处找寻这样的关爱
Looking for them everywhere,

846
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,590
在汉・索罗身上找
in Han Solo,

847
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,870
现在又在天行者身上找
now in Skywalker.

848
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,070
他有没有告诉你那晚发生了什么?
Did he tell you what happened that night?

849
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,430
有
Yes.

850
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,590
才怪
No.

851
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,990
他感应到我的力量
He had sensed my power,

852
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,030
就像他感应到你的一样
as he senses yours.

853
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,990
那让他恐惧
And he feared it.

854
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,110
你撒谎
Liar.

855
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,910
让往事烟消云散吧
Let the past die.

856
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,830
即使亲手扼杀 也在所不惜
Kill it if you have to.

857
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,110
只有这样 你才能成为真正的强者
That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.

858
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,230
不！
No! No!

859
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,110
蕾伊
Rey?

860
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,870
我本应该发现自己受困 感到恐慌
I should have felt trapped or panicked.

861
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,510
但是我没有
But I didn't.

862
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,910
这种感觉没有持续太久
This didn't go on forever,

863
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,150
我知道它会带我去某个地方
I knew it was leading somewhere.

864
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,380
在尽头 它会让我见到我想看的东西
And that, at the end, it would show me what I came to see.

865
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,950
蕾伊
Rey.

866
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,670
让我见他们
Let me see them.

867
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,150
我父母...
My parents,

868
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,390
求求你
please.

869
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,590
我以为会在这里找到答案
I thought I'd find answers here.

870
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,550
我错了
I was wrong.

871
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,870
我从未感受到如此孤单
I'd never felt so alone.

872
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,790
你并不孤单
You're not alone.

873
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,240
你也一样
Neither are you.

874
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,600
蕾伊?
Rey?

875
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,070
现在还不算太迟
It isn't too late.

876
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,830
停！
Stop!

877
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,110
是真的吗? 你是不是企图杀害他?
Is it true? Did you try to murder him?

878
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,710
马上离开这座岛
Leave this island now!

879
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,070
站住
Stop.

880
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,350
站住
Stop!

881
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,990
是你干的吗?
Did you do it?

882
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,190
是你一手造就了凯洛・伦?
Did you create Kylo Ren?

883
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,430
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth.

884
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,630
我看见黑暗
I saw darkness.

885
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,350
我感觉到黑暗滋生于他内心
I'd sensed it building in him.

886
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,160
我在他训练时看到这一情况
I'd seen it in moments during his training.

887
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,510
但接着我深入探索
But then I looked inside,

888
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,710
发现情况已经超乎我的想像
and it was beyond what I ever imagined.

889
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,110
斯努克已经改变了他的心性
Snoke had already turned his heart.

890
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,550
他会给我们带来破坏 痛苦与死亡
He would bring destruction, and pain, and death,

891
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,670
终结我所爱的一切 因为他总有一天会变得邪恶
and the end of everything I love because of what he will become.

892
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,630
曾有那么一瞬间...
And for the briefest moment of pure instinct,

893
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,990
我以为我能阻止这一切
I thought I could stop it.

894
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,540
那念头转瞬即逝
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

895
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,310
我感到深深的羞愧...
And I was left with shame,

896
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,590
带来了严重的后果
and with consequence.

897
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,230
我所见到的最后一个画面
And the last thing I saw

898
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,670
是一个被师傅辜负的男孩
were the eyes of a frightened boy

899
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,220
那惊慌失措的眼神
whose master had failed him.

900
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,910
本 不！
Ben, no!

901
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,950
你辜负他是因为 你认为他已下定决心
You failed him by thinking his choice was made.

902
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,030
其实并没有
It wasn't.

903
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,270
他的内心依然矛盾
There's still conflict in him.

904
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,080
如果他从黑暗面回头 就可能改变局面
If he were turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide.

905
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,990
这可能是我们获胜的方法
This could be how we win.

906
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,150
情况不会如你所想的那样发展
This is not going to go the way you think.

907
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,900
会的
It is.

908
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,870
刚刚我们双手碰触时
Just now when we touched hands,

909
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,310
我看到了他的未来
I saw his future.

910
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,950
就像我面前的你一样真实
As solid as I'm seeing you.

911
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,950
如果我去找他 本・索罗会回来的
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

912
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,270
蕾伊
Rey,

913
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,830
不要这么做
don't do this.

914
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,310
那他就是我们最后的希望
Then he's our last hope.

915
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,830
尤达大师
Master Yoda.

916
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,110
年轻的天行者
Young Skywalker.

917
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,830
我要终结这一切
I'm ending all of this.

918
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,620
古树 文本 绝地武士
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

919
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,990
我要把这些一把火给烧了
I'm gonna burn it down.

920
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,830
天行者
Ah, Skywalker.

921
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,950
我好想你
Missed you, have I.

922
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,790
所以...
So it is time

923
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,150
绝地武士团终结的时候到了
for the Jedi Order to end.

924
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,550
确实如此
Time it is.

925
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,870
那你也别再去管这堆旧书了
For you to look past a pile of old books, hmm?

926
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,710
那可是神圣的绝地典籍
The sacred Jedi texts.

927
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,030
你读过了么?
Oh. Read them, have you?

928
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,190
- 我... C它们...
- Well, I... - Page-turners

929
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,620
读起来很枯燥
they were not.

930
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,150
是啊 是啊
Yes, yes, yes.

931
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,680
它们的确充满智慧
Wisdom they held,

932
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,310
但那藏书阁里
but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey

933
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,390
已经没有所蕾伊需要的知识了
does not already possess.

934
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,230
天行者啊
Skywalker,

935
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,070
你还是眺望远方
still looking to the horizon.

936
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,700
从不着眼当下?
Never here, now, hmm?

937
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,480
从不注意你眼前的需求
The need in front of your nose.

938
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,790
当时我软弱
I was weak.

939
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,030
不明智
Unwise.

940
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,760
你确实失去了本・索罗
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

941
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,910
我们绝对不能失去蕾伊
Lose Rey, we must not.

942
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,150
我无法再变成她需要我成为的那种人
I can't be what she needs me to be.

943
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,990
你没注意听我的话吗?
Heeded my words not, did you?

944
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,950
传授你所学到的
Pass on what you have learned.

945
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,230
力量 技巧
Strength, mastery.

946
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,790
还要传授你的弱点...
But weakness,

947
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,340
愚蠢 以及你经历过的失败
folly, failure also.

948
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,630
对 最重要的是失败
Yes, failure most of all.

949
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,750
失败是最佳的导师
The greatest teacher, failure is.

950
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,070
卢克
Luke,

951
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,070
我们注定要被他们超越
we are what they grow beyond.

952
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,030
这是所有的绝地大师肩上的重担
That is the true burden of all masters.

953
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,230
还有四秒差距 这飞船够快
Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks.

954
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,070
希望我们还来得及
I just hope we're in time.

955
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,630
你真的有办法破解吧?
You can actually do this, right?

956
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,190
关于这一点...
Yeah, about that...

957
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,390
两位 我能做到
Guys, I can do it.

958
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,030
不过得先谈好价钱
But there exists a pre-"do it" conversation about price.

959
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,150
任务搞定了 你想要什么 抵抗组织都能提供给你
Once we're done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want.

960
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,070
你们准备付多少定金?
What you got deposit-wise?

961
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,150
开什么玩笑?你看我们这样子
Are you kidding me? Look at us.

962
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,990
那是黑山金吗?
Is that Haysian smelt?

963
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,960
好东西
That's something.

964
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,310
不行 我们说话算话 你会拿到报酬的
No, we gave you our word. You're gonna get paid.

965
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,630
这样应该就够了
That should be enough.

966
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,070
两位 我也想继续帮你们
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

967
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,670
但没定金 我也无能为力
But no something, n-n-no doing.

968
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,830
给我听好 你必须...
Okay, listen here, you've got...

969
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,030
来干活吧
Do it.

970
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,870
现在我能帮你们了
Now I can help.

971
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,430
把那还回去
Give it back.

972
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,910
你说什么?
What?

973
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,070
把那还回去
Give it back!

974
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,110
你不知道那奖章对她来说有多么重要
You have no idea how much that medallion means to her.

975
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,710
你干嘛在自己的飞船上翻箱倒柜?
What are you... Why are you ransacking your own ship?

976
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,230
这不是你的飞船
It's not your ship.

977
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,070
他说是我偷的
He says I stole it.

978
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,430
- 我听得懂它说话 - 我们一起偷的
- Yeah, I got that. - We stole it.

979
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,590
至少你们是偷坏人的东西...
At least you're stealing from the bad guys

980
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,230
拿来做好事
and helping the good.

981
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,350
好人 坏人
Good guys, bad guys,

982
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,550
叫什么都无所谓
made-up words.

983
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,830
我来看看这破飞船本来是谁的?
Let's see who formerly owned this gorgeous hunk-uh.

984
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,150
这家伙是军火商
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

985
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,150
靠卖武器给坏人赚了大钱
Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys.

986
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,950
也卖给好人
And the good.

987
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,310
芬恩 我来给你讲个大道理
Finn, let me learn you something big.

988
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,830
银河系就像一台机器 伙计
It's all a machine, partner.

989
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,350
好好日子 别浑水
Live free, don't join.

990
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,780
那是他们的最后一艘支援舰了
That was the last of their support ships.

991
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,030
现在只剩他们的主巡洋舰了
It's just their main cruiser now.

992
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,070
他们的燃料存量还能撑多久?
And their fuel reserve?

993
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,950
根据我们的计算...
By our calculation,

994
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,590
快用完了
critical.

995
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,830
她在里面么?
She in there?

996
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,910
中将禁止你进入舰桥
The admiral's banned you from the bridge.

997
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,470
- 别乱来 C我就是要乱来
- Let's not have a scene. - No, let's.

998
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,470
- 霍尔朵? C上尉 你不准进来
- Holdo? - You're not allowed in here.

999
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,980
- 飞行员 - 少废话了 女士
- Flyboy. - Cut it, lady.

1000
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,790
我们的舰队只剩下一艘飞船了
We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship,

1001
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,590
你却什么都没讲
and you've told us nothing!

1002
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,310
希望你已经有计划了
Tell us that we have a plan!

1003
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,470
我们还有希望
That there's hope!

1004
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,030
要是莉亚还领导着我们
When I served under Leia,

1005
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,660
她会说 希望就像太阳
she would say, hope is like the sun.

1006
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,350
如果你只有能看见太阳的时候 才相信光明尚存
If you only believe in it when you can see it...

1007
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,750
那你永远都熬不过黑夜
You'll never make it through the night.

1008
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,520
对
Yes.

1009
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,630
你在给运输机加燃料?
Are you fueling up the transports?

1010
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,430
的确如此
You are.

1011
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,380
你把燃料全部转移过去了?
All of them?

1012
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,270
我们要弃舰 这...
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

1013
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,550
这就是你的计划? 我们弃舰逃跑?
That's what you got? That's what you brought us to?

1014
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,270
懦夫
Coward!

1015
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,030
那些运输机没有武器 没有护盾
Those transport ships are unarmed, unshielded.

1016
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,470
放弃这艘巡洋舰 我们就完蛋了
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1017
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,350
我们就一点机会都没了 你不只是个懦夫
We don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward,

1018
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,030
你还是个叛徒
you are a traitor.

1019
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,990
把这个人赶出舰桥
Get this man off my bridge.

1020
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,110
芬恩 霍尔朵让船员们登上穿梭舰
Finn, Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttle.

1021
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,990
她准备弃舰 你们在哪?
She's going to abandon ship. Where are you?

1022
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,870
波 我们正在回舰队的路上
Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet.

1023
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,180
马上就到
We're so close.

1024
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,390
你们找到解码大师了吗?
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1025
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,670
我们找到了一位会解码的
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1026
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,190
我们能关闭追踪器
We can shut the tracker down.

1027
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,270
为大家争取一些时间
Just buy us a little more time.

1028
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,990
好 动作快
All right. Hurry.

1029
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,950
我一起飞 你就跳回去
As soon as I launch, you jump back out of range.

1030
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,870
待在那里 等我告诉你碰面的地点
Stay there until you get my signal for where to rendezvous.

1031
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,470
如果你比我先见到芬恩
If you see Finn before I do,

1032
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,550
告诉他...
tell him...

1033
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,510
很好 就这么说
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

1034
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,830
隐藏我们的路线 我们应该不会被他们侦测到
Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes.

1035
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,950
然后我们在他们的护盾上划出一道口子
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1036
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,750
以迅雷不及掩耳之势
Blip bloppity bloop,

1037
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,750
穿过去
and slip right through.

1038
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,310
你说那个前冲锋队士兵和那个谁在干什么?
So a stormtrooper and a who now are doing what?

1039
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,620
他们想救我们
They are trying to save us.

1040
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,390
这是我们逃脱的最佳机会
This is our best chance for escape.

1041
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,510
你得尽量给芬恩和萝丝争取时间
You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can.

1042
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,030
你赌上抵抗组织的存亡
You have bet the survival of the Resistance

1043
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,950
使得大家陷入危机
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1044
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,260
来不及了
There's no time now.

1045
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,470
我们得从巡洋舰撤离
We have to get clear of the cruiser. Load the transports.

1046
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,550
- 全体登上运输机 C马上就去 中将
Right away, admiral.

1047
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,750
我就怕您会下达这样的命令
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1048
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,790
霍尔朵中将
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1049
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,670
我在此解除你的指挥权
I am relieving you of your command

1050
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,110
以保证本巡洋舰 全体船员的安全 维系我抵抗组织的生存
for the survival of this ship, its crew, and the Resistance.

1051
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,230
希望你明白自己在做些什么
I hope you understand what you're doing.

1052
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,750
我明白
Yeah.

1053
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,110
我去舰桥
I'm going to the bridge.

1054
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,270
他们敢轻举妄动 就打昏他们
If they move, stun them.

1055
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,950
目前至少三个周期...
...at least three cycles so far.

1056
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,630
是 长官 我们正在努力
Yes, sir. We are working on it.

1057
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,750
我会尽力 长官
I will do my best, sir.

1058
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,150
就快到了
Almost there.

1059
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,070
你不必这样
You don't have to do this.

1060
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,230
我感受到了你内心的矛盾
I feel the conflict in you.

1061
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,110
这让你濒临崩溃
It's tearing you apart.

1062
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,510
本 我触碰到你双手的时候
Ben, when we touched hands,

1063
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,190
我看到了你的未来
I saw your future.

1064
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,780
虽然只有轮廓 但完整而清晰
Just the shape of it, but solid and clear.

1065
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,590
你不会屈服于斯努克的
You will not bow before Snoke.

1066
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,190
你会回心转意的
You'll turn.

1067
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,070
我会帮助你的
I'll help you.

1068
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,150
我看到了
I saw it.

1069
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,950
我也看到了
I saw something, too.

1070
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,390
我看到的那些让我明白
Because of what I saw,

1071
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,990
当那一刻来临 转换阵营的人会是你
I know when the moment comes, you'll be the one to turn.

1072
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,510
你会跟我站在同一阵线
You'll stand with me.

1073
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,190
蕾伊
Rey,

1074
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,710
我看到了你的父母是谁
I saw who your parents are.

1075
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,910
非常好 我忠心的好徒弟
Well done, my good and faithful apprentice.

1076
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,270
我对你又有信心了
My faith in you is restored.

1077
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,630
年轻的蕾伊
Young Rey.

1078
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,310
欢迎
Welcome.

1079
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,950
我们到了
So this is it.

1080
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,990
追踪器就在这道门后
The tracker's right behind this door.

1081
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,310
黑山金
Haysian smelt.

1082
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,150
最佳导体
Best conductor.

1083
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,270
不客气
And you're welcome.

1084
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,110
现在该想想我们应该怎么回舰队吧?
Good time to figure out how we get back to the fleet?

1085
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,950
我知道最近的逃生舱在哪
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1086
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,030
你当然知道
Course you do.

1087
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,910
BB-8 快来告诉我点好消息
BB-8, tell me something good.

1088
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,990
波 我们快到了
Poe, we're almost there.

1089
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,380
准备让巡洋舰以光速前进
Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

1090
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,750
我马上去准备 你们快点就行了
Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry.

1091
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,870
清空舰桥 护送军官们去机库
Clear the bridge, escort the officers down to the hangar.

1092
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,550
指挥官...达默龙上尉
Commander... Captain Dameron,

1093
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,510
霍尔朵中将找你
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1094
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,820
我们刚刚已经谈过了
Yeah, we spoke.

1095
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,510
长官 我有些不敢向您发问 我...
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1096
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,510
3P0 你的直觉是正确的 保持下去
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.

1097
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,270
把门锁上
Seal that door!

1098
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,110
我们时间不够了
We're running out of time.

1099
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,420
快啊 进展如何了?
Come on, how's it going?

1100
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,150
快好了
Almost there.

1101
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,030
3P0 你想去哪?
Threepio, where do you think you're going?

1102
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,190
参加叛乱违反
It would be quite against my programming

1103
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,070
- 我的程序设定 - 嘿
- to be party to a mutiny. - Hey!

1104
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,070
这样做是错误的
It is not correct protocol.

1105
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,350
那也是错的
Oh! Neither is this!

1106
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,390
芬恩? 我们准备跳跃了
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

1107
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,820
再不关掉就来不及了
Now or never.

1108
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,790
成了
Now.

1109
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,830
你上
You're up.

1110
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,830
- 你们 双手举起来 - 看住他们
- You there, hands up! - Watch 'em, watch 'em.

1111
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,950
放下武器 双手举起来 叛军渣滓们
- Drop your weapons, now! - Hands up, Rebel scum.

1112
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,710
趴下 再说一遍 趴下
Get down! I said, down!

1113
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,270
FN-2187
FN-2187.

1114
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,510
可算是把你盼回来了
So good to have you back.

1115
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,470
他们失败了
They didn't make it.

1116
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,510
莉亚
Leia.

1117
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,350
请按照指定的撤离编号
Please board the transports

1118
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,750
登上运输机
according to your evacuation designation.

1119
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,910
所有运输机必须...
All transports must be cleared...

1120
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,140
各位 帮我把他推上去
Okay, help me push him up, guys.

1121
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,030
他很爱制造麻烦
That one's a troublemaker.

1122
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,900
我喜欢他
I like him.

1123
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,670
我也是
Me, too.

1124
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,390
该登上运输机了
Now, time to board your transport.

1125
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,190
为了保证运输机安全撤离
For the transports to escape,

1126
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,150
必须留下人驾驶这艘巡洋舰
someone needs to stay behind and pilot the cruiser.

1127
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,310
我们已经失去太多人了
Too many losses.

1128
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,110
我再也无法承受了
I can't take any more.

1129
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,750
你可以的
Sure you can.

1130
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,190
你教过我的
You taught me how.

1131
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,910
愿原力与...
May the Force be...

1132
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,670
你说吧 我说得够多了
You go on. I've said it enough.

1133
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,910
愿原力永远与你同在
May the Force be with you always.

1134
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,910
启动掩护装置
Cloaking device activated.

1135
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,830
我们应该能逃出他们的射程
We should be off their scopes.

1136
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,380
希望这办法奏效
Let's hope this works.

1137
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,310
走近一些 孩子
Come closer, child.

1138
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,630
好强大的力量
So much strength.

1139
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,070
黑暗崛起
Darkness rises,

1140
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:29,980
光明与之抗衡
and light to meet it.

1141
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,830
我警告过我的这位年轻徒弟
I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger,

1142
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,720
他越强大 光明也会随之出现
his equal in the light would rise.

1143
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,390
天行者
Skywalker...

1144
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,310
我的想法...
I assumed.

1145
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,390
错了
Wrongly.

1146
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,430
我说了 走近一点
Closer, I said.

1147
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,990
你低估了天行者
You underestimate Skywalker,

1148
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,830
和本・索罗
and Ben Solo,

1149
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,790
还有我
and me.

1150
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,310
- 你会栽在自己手上 - 是么
It will be your downfall.

1151
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,870
你看见了什么吗?
Have you seen something?

1152
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,270
你看到了我徒弟的弱点
A weakness in my apprentice.

1153
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,430
所以你才来到这里?
Is that why you came?

1154
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,870
小傻瓜
Young fool.

1155
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,750
是我连结你们的心智
It was I who bridged your minds.

1156
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,550
我刺激了伦矛盾的灵魂
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1157
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,830
我知道他不够坚强 瞒不了你
I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you.

1158
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,230
你也不够聪明 无法抵挡诱惑
And you were not wise enough to resist the bait.

1159
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,120
现在...
And now,

1160
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,510
你会先告诉我天行者的下落
you will give me Skywalker.

1161
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,150
然后我会...
Then I will kill you

1162
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,030
用最残酷的方法杀了你
with the cruelest stroke.

1163
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,870
不要
No.

1164
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,740
没错
Yes.

1165
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,470
把一切...
Give me

1166
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,510
都给我
everything.

1167
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,750
不...
No! No!

1168
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,270
不要
No!

1169
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,990
不要
No. No.

1170
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,350
不...
No, no, no!

1171
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,350
波
Poe.

1172
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,070
那是哪里?
What is that?

1173
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,030
矿物星球 柯瑞特星
The mineral planet, Crait.

1174
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,550
义军时期的秘密藏身处
An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion.

1175
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,950
- 那是座起义军基地? C已废弃
- That's a Rebel base? - Abandoned,

1176
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,430
不过防御工事坚固
but heavily armored

1177
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,590
那里的电力
with enough power

1178
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,870
足以将求救讯号传给...
to get a distress signal to our allies

1179
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,220
遍布于外环星域的盟友们
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1180
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,190
霍尔朵知道第一秩序...
Holdo knew the First Order

1181
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,500
在追踪我们的大型舰
was tracking our big ship.

1182
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,510
但他们没有监控小型运输机
They're not monitoring for little transports.

1183
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,230
所以我们能悄悄在星球表面降落
So we could slip down to the surface unnoticed

1184
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,670
躲到第一秩序舰队离开为止
and hide till the First Order passes.

1185
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,910
这方法可行
That could work.

1186
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,510
她比较有兴趣
She was more interested

1187
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,990
保护火种
in protecting the light than she was

1188
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,020
而不是逞英雄
seeming like a hero.

1189
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,270
天佑
Godspeed,

1190
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,990
义军！
Rebels.

1191
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,070
非常好 法斯玛
Well done, Phasma.

1192
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,950
这是你的飞船和报酬 我们谈好了的
Your ship and payment, as we agreed.

1193
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,430
你这阴险的小人
You lying snake.

1194
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,550
咱们被逮了...
We got caught,

1195
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,310
我就谈了条件
I cut a d-d-deal.

1196
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,150
等等
Wait,

1197
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,160
你用什么谈条件?
cut a deal with what?

1198
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,910
长官 我们核实了这窃贼提供的情报
Sir, we checked on the information from the thief.

1199
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,870
我们进行了反隐形扫描 果然...
We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough,

1200
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,350
30架抵抗组织运输机刚刚从巡洋舰起飞
30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser.

1201
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,710
他说的是实话
He told us the truth.

1202
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,190
他们能否继续创造奇迹呢
Will wonders never cease?

1203
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,390
不
No.

1204
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,830
我们的武器就绪了吗?
Our weapons are ready?

1205
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,350
准备完成 并已瞄准 长官
Ready and aimed, sir.

1206
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,830
随意开火
Fire at will.

1207
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,070
等等 不 不行
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

1208
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,990
不！
No!

1209
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,750
中将 我们遭受攻击
Admiral, we're taking fire!

1210
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,350
- 要掉头吗? C不行 你们太远了
- Do we turn around? - No, you're too far out.

1211
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,150
全速降落在星球上
Full speed to planetfall.

1212
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,310
全速降落
Full speed!

1213
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,990
真没想到天行者这么聪明
I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise.

1214
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,160
我们就如他所愿 杀掉他
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1215
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,710
终结绝地武士团
the death he desires.

1216
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,580
消灭掉叛军后
After the Rebels are gone,

1217
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,230
我们就去他的星球
we will go to his planet

1218
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,230
抹掉整座岛
and obliterate the entire island.

1219
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,430
勇气可嘉
Such spunk.

1220
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,230
看看这个
Look here now.

1221
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,700
全体抵抗组织成员都在那些运输机上
The entire Resistance on those transports...

1222
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:58,060
我们很快就会歼灭他们
Soon they will all be gone.

1223
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,550
对你来说 大势已去
For you, all is lost.

1224
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,590
看你这雄心不死的样子啊
Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope.

1225
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,390
你拥有真正的绝地精神
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1226
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,200
所以
And because of that,

1227
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,710
你非死不可
you must die.

1228
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,670
我杰出的徒弟
My worthy apprentice,

1229
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,590
黑暗之子 维达尊主的继承人
son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1230
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,190
以往内心的矛盾已化为决心
Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve.

1231
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,070
以往的弱点化为力量
Where there was weakness, strength.

1232
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,470
完成你的训练
Complete your training,

1233
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,190
达成你的使命
and fulfill your destiny.

1234
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,110
我知道我该怎么做
I know what I have to do.

1235
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,270
本
Ben.

1236
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,150
你以为你能让他回头?
You think you can turn him?

1237
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,510
可悲的孩子
Pathetic child.

1238
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,460
不可能有人背叛我
I cannot be betrayed,

1239
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,710
不可能有人击败我
I cannot be beaten.

1240
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,230
我能看穿他的想法
I see his mind,

1241
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,470
洞悉他的意图
I see his every intent.

1242
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,550
没错
Yes.

1243
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:29,750
我看见他挥动光剑 击中目标
I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true.

1244
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,390
现在
And now,

1245
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,070
傻孩子 你看啊
foolish child,

1246
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,190
他点亮光剑
he ignites it,

1247
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,390
杀死了他真正的敌人
and kills his true enemy!

1248
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,230
快啊 全力加速 全速前进
Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!

1249
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,790
正在全速前进 长官
I am, sir.

1250
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,990
你这王八蛋
You murdering bastard!

1251
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,790
别激动 芬大哥
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

1252
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,070
今天他们炸你 明天你炸他们
They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow.

1253
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,430
做生意就是这样嘛
It's just business.

1254
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,190
你错了
You're wrong.

1255
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,910
也许吧
Maybe.

1256
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,390
本
Ben!

1257
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,820
舰队
The fleet.

1258
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,990
命令他们停止射击
Order them to stop firing.

1259
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,950
还来得及拯救舰队
There's still time to save the fleet.

1260
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,750
本?
Ben?

1261
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,910
是时候终结这些过时的事物了
It's time to let old things die.

1262
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,750
斯努克
Snoke,

1263
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,190
天行者
Skywalker.

1264
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,590
西斯
The Sith,

1265
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,110
绝地武士 起义军
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1266
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,630
让他们去死吧
Let it all die.

1267
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,310
蕾伊
Rey.

1268

我要你和我一起

01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,360
我们联合统治 为银河系带来新秩序
We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1270
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,910
不要这么做 本

1271
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,150
求求你不要走这条路
Please don't go this way.

1272
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,790
不 你还是执着于往事！忘掉它们吧
No, no. You're still holding on! Let go!

1273
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,230
关于你父母的真相 你想知道么?
Do you wanna know the truth about your parents?

1274
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,630
还是你一直都知道真相?
Or have you always known?

1275
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,790
只是把它们藏在心底
And you've just hidden it away.

1276
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,350
你知道真相
You know the truth.

1277
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,630

说出来啊
Say it.

1279
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,510
他们只是无名小卒
They were nobody.

1280
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,310
他们是捡破烂的
They were filthy junk traders

1281
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,390
为了买酒喝就把你卖掉
who sold you off for drinking money.

1282
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,550
他们死了 埋在贾库星荒漠的穷人坟墓里
They're dead in a paupers' grave in the Jakku desert.

1283
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,270
你以前不值一提
You have no place in this story.

1284
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,430
出身卑微 一无是处
You come from nothing. You're nothing.

1285
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,030
但我不这么觉得
But not to me.

1286
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,110
和我一起吧
Join me.

1287

01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,030
长官
Sir,

1289
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:08,390
抵抗组织巡洋舰准备跳至光速
the Resistance cruiser's preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1290
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,270
那艘飞船是空的
It's empty.

1291
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,230
他们想转移我们的注意力
They're just trying to pull our attention away.

1292
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,860
真可悲
Pathetic.

1293
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,230
继续攻击运输机编队
Keep your fire on the transports.

1294
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,790
如果用爆能枪处决他们 那就太便宜他们了
Execution by blaster is too good for them.

1295
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,990
给他们来点更痛苦的
Let's make this hurt.

1296
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,710

1307
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,270
你是咱们内部的蛀虫
You are a bug in the system.

1308
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,830
少废话 亮光头

1309
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,630
来啊
Come on!

1310
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,310
不！
No!

1311
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,270

1315

发生了什么?
What happened?

1318
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:32,360
她乘坐斯努克的逃生艇逃离了
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1319
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,150
我知道她去哪了

1320
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,870
集合所有部队前往那座抵抗组织基地

1324
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,390
你想指挥我的军队?

1325
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,510
最高领袖死了 我们没有统治者
Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!

1326
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,350
以前的最高领袖已经死了

1327

敌机来袭！

1330
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,350

1333
01:56:58,520 --> 01:56:59,550

1334
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,710
停火

1342
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,310
等一下 慢点
Is this all that's left?

1343
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,870
咱们只剩下这些人?
All right, shields are up so they can't hit us from orbit.

1344
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,420
护盾启动 他们无法从行星轨道上攻击我们
Use whatever power we've got left

1345
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,630

1347
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,790
如果抵抗组织有任何盟友...

1348
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,470
此时不行动 更待何时
it's now or never.

1349
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,110
萝丝 有什么发现么?

过期的弹药 生锈的炮塔 半残的飞行器
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery, some half-gutted skim speeders.

1351
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,350
好吧
Well,

1352
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:53,790
那我们祈祷那道大门
let's just pray that big-ass door

1353
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,190
能撑到我们找到救兵吧

微型死星科技

1357
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,830
它会像打蛋一样撞开那道门
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1358
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,310
这里应该有逃出去的路吧?

BB-8 有什么发现?

跟我来

I don't like these rust buckets and I don't like our odds, but...

1380
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,080

维持紧密队形

地面部队 开始射击

13架小型机靠近

1385
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,750
我们是否要先歼灭他们 再推进吗?
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1386
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:44,830
不用 抵抗组织就在那个矿坑里

02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,500
向前推进
Push through.

1388

战斗机 散开！

Oh, they hate that ship!

1400
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,390
楚伊
Chewie!

1401
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,750
它出现了
There it is!

1402
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,070
好大的一座炮塔
That is a big gun.

1403
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,510
它的护甲很厚
Okay, it's heavily armored.

1404
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,670
要想摧毁它 炮口是我们唯一的机会
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1405
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,230
炮口打开了 机会来了

集中全部火力攻击飞行器

集中火力攻击飞行器

1408
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,510
我们损失惨重
We're taking heavy losses.

1409
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,790
他们把我们一一击落 我们无法完成任务
They're picking us all off. We're not gonna make it.

1410
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,670
好 准备使出我的绝招
All right, making my final approach.

1411
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,230
目标出现 准备开火
Target in sight, guns are hot.

1412
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,620
不 撤退
No! Pull off!

1413
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,830
你说什么?
What?

1414
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,430
炮塔已经就绪 我们这是自杀
The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run!

1415
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,950
全体撤离
All craft, pull away!

1416
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:12,190
- 不 我就快到了 C芬恩 撤退
- No! I'm almost there! - Retreat, Finn!

1417
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,580
这是命令
That's an order!

1418
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,750
芬恩? 来不及了 不要
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

1419
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,910
不 我不会让他们赢
No! I won't let them win!

1420
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,910
不 芬恩 听波的命令
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

1421
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,510
我们必须撤退
We have to retreat!

1422
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,990
炮塔暖机中
The cannon is warming up now.

1423
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,350
收到 看见了
Copy that. We see it.

1424
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,270
准备发射
Preparing to fire.

1425
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,910
快走 快
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1426
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,750
快点...
Let's go, let's go!

1427
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,350
罗丝?
Rose?

1428
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,110
罗丝?
Rose?

1429
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,910
罗丝?
Rose?

1430
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,670
你为什么要那样做?
Why would you do that? Huh?

1431
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,630
我马上就到了
I was almost there.

1432
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:58,910
为什么阻止我?
Why would you stop me?

1433
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,790
我救了你啊
I saved you,

1434
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,830
笨蛋
dummy.

1435
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,630
这样我们才会赢
That's how we're gonna win.

1436
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,180
不是对抗我们痛恨的
Not fighting what we hate,

1437
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:11,990
而是拯救我们所爱的人
saving what we love.

1438
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,790
赫克斯将军
General Hux,

1439
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,510
进攻
advance.

1440
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,550
格杀勿论
No quarter.

1441
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,510
不留战俘
No prisoners.

1442
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,510
有许多地方接收到了我们的求救信号
Our distress signal's been received at multiple points,

1443
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:46,750
但没人回应
but no response.

1444
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,070
他们能听见我们
They've heard us,

1445
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,550
却没有人来救我们
but no one's coming.

1446
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,070
我们奋战到最后
We fought till the end.

1447
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:05,340
可是...银河系失去了所有希望
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1448
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,150
希望之火
The spark

1449
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,550
已熄灭
is out.

1450
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,710
卢克
Luke.

1451
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,750
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

1452
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,790
我换了个发型
I changed my hair.

1453
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,470
这样挺好看的
It's nice that way.

1454
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,950
莉亚
Leia,

1455
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,110
对不起
I'm sorry.

1456
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,150
我知道
I know.

1457
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,550
我知道你很抱歉
I know you are.

1458
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,310
我很高兴最后一刻...
I'm just glad you're here

1459
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,790
你来到了这里
at the end.

1460
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,030
我要去见他 莉亚
I came to face him, Leia.

1461
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,270
但我救不了他
And I can't save him.

1462
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:22,910
很久以来 我都心存一丝希望
I held out hope for so long,

1463
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:28,240
但我知道我儿子已经不在了
but I know my son is gone.

1464
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,830
没有人会真的消失
No one's ever really gone.

1465
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,270
卢克大师
Master Luke.

1466
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,310
停火
Stop!

1467
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,470
我要集中所有火力 攻击那个人
I want every gun we have to fire on that man.

1468
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,110
动手
Do it.

1469
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:26,870
继续射击
More!

1470
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,150
继续！
More!

1471
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,350
够了
That's enough.

1472
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,990
够了
That's enough!

1473
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,550
你以为你这样能干掉他么?
Do you think you got him?

1474
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,710
如果我们继续前进
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

1475
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,070
就能结束这一切
we can finish this.

1476
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,350
长官?
Sir?

1477
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,160
降落 我要去找他
Bring me down to him.

1478
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,350
把门关好 我没下令不准前进
Keep the door covered and don't advance until I say.

1479
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,430
最高领袖
Supreme Leader,

1480
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,390
不要分心 我们的目标...
don't get distracted, our goal...

1481
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,100
马上降落 长官
Right away, sir.

1482
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,750
医药包
Med pack!

1483
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:47,990
我需要医药包
I need a med pack!

1484
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,230
她伤得很重
She's hurt pretty bad.

1485
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,270
是凯洛・伦
It's Kylo Ren.

1486
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,670
卢克单独去见他
Luke's facing him alone.

1487
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,190
我们应该去帮他 我们走
Well, we should help him. Let's go.

1488
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,070
不 等一下
No, wait. Wait.

1489
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,390
你回到这 是要说你原谅我了么?
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

1490
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,270
是来这拯救我的灵魂么?
To save my soul?

1491
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,630
不是
No.

1492
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,750
他这么做是有原因的
He's doing this for a reason.

1493
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,350
他在拖延时间 我们才能逃走
He's stalling so we can escape.

1494
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:03,430
逃走?
Escape?

1495
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,590
他现在以一敌百
He's one man against an army.

1496
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,190
我们得帮他 全力反抗
We have to help him, we have to fight.

1497
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:08,550
不 我们是摧毁
No, no. We are the spark that'll light the fire

1498
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:10,230
第一秩序的星火
that'll burn the First Order down.

1499
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:14,430
天行者这么做是要让我们生存下去
Skywalker's doing this so we can survive.

1500
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:16,070
一定有办法离开这矿坑
There's gotta be a way out of this mine.

1501
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,300
要不然他怎么进来的?
Hell, how did he get in here?

1502
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:21,510
长官 这里可能有地图上未记录的天然出口
Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists.

1503
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,670
但这里像迷宫 有无数地道
But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels

1504
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:26,550
找到出口的机率
that the odds of finding an exit

1505
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,310
- 是15428... - 行了
- are 15,428... - Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

1506
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,950
闭嘴
Shut up!

1507
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,870
- 分之一 C仔细听
- To one. - Listen.

1508
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:38,790
我的声音感应已经没...
My audio sensors no longer detect the...

1509
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,030
没错
Exactly.

1510
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:48,630
那只水晶动物跑哪去了?
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1511
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,310
跟我来
Follow me.

1512
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,830
你们看我干嘛?
What are you looking at me for?

1513
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,470
跟他走
Follow him.

1514
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:17,580
如果信标就在我们下方 他们一定在附近
If the beacon's right beneath us, they've got to be somewhere.

1515
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,270
继续扫描生物
Keep scanning for life forms.

1516
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,590
这边
This way.

1517
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,790
我看到它们了！楚伊 那里
I see them! Chewie, there!

1518
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,350
不
No. No, no, no.

1519
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,750
不...
No!

1520
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,830
抬起石头
Lifting rocks.

1521
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:54,430
我辜负了你 本
I failed you, Ben.

1522
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,630
- 对不起 - 你当然应该感到抱歉
- I'm sorry. - I'm sure you are!

1523
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,870
抵抗组织已经覆灭
The Resistance is dead.

1524
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,590
战争结束了
The war is over.

1525
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,790
等我杀了你
And when I kill you,

1526
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,390
我也就杀了最后一位绝地武士
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1527
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,670
说的真精彩
Amazing.

1528
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,990
你刚刚说的这些 没有一个字是对的
Every word of what you just said was wrong.

1529
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,470
起义军今日重生
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1530
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,670
战争...
The war

1531
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,510
才刚刚开始
is just beginning.

1532
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,600
我也不会是最后一位绝地武士
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1533
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,430
我会干掉她
I'll destroy her,

1534
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,630
还有你
and you,

1535
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,430
所有的一切
and all of it.

1536
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,270
不
No.

1537
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:24,630
要是你满怀愤怒 把我杀了 我会永远缠着你
Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you.

1538
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,350
就像你父亲那样缠着你
Just like your father.

1539
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,790
不
No.

1540
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,230
再会了 孩子
See you around, kid.

1541
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,310
不！
No!

1542
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,790
凯
C'ai!

1543
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,830
他真是好朋友
Such a friend.

1544
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,910
楚伊
Chewie!

1545
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:27,990
看起来不错
It looks good.

1546
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:29,580
实在太夸张了
That was crazy, man.

1547
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,510
- 嗨 C嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

1548
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,150
我是波
I'm Poe.

1549
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,990
蕾伊
Rey.

1550
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,390
我知道
I know.

1551
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:51,710
等我们到外环星域 我那边有熟人
When we get to the Outer Rim, I have a contact there.

1552
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,020
绝对有可能
Quite definitely possible.

1553
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,990
