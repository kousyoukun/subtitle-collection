The Force is not a power you have.

It's not about lifting rocks.

It's the energy between all things,

a tension, a balance,

That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.

I saw darkness.

885
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,350

I'd sensed it building in him.

01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,160

I'd seen it in moments during his training.

887
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,510

But then I looked inside,

888
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,710

Snoke had already turned his heart.

And for the briefest moment of pure instinct,

I thought I could stop it.

It passed like a fleeting shadow.

897

The Resistance is dead.

The war is over.

And when I kill you,

I will have killed the last Jedi.

Amazing.

Every word of what you just said was wrong.

The Rebellion is reborn today.

And I will not be the last Jedi.

I'll destroy her,

Just like your father.

Chewie!

I know.

When we get to the Outer Rim, I have a contact there.

1552

Quite definitely possible.

Luke is gone.

I felt it.

But it wasn't sadness or pain.

1556
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,310

It was peace and purpose.

I felt it, too.

How do we build a Rebellion from this?

We have everything we need.
