1
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:05,852
Look, Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever.
看，已接近翡翠城而且它更漂亮了

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:09,516
<i>We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of...</i>
我们去找巫师，巫师在。。。

3
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:12,163
<i>I am Oz, the great and powerful.</i>
我是奥兹，伟大而权威

4
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:14,365
<i>Who are you?</i>
你sei啊？

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,965
Now, give me those ruby slippers
or your dog goes into the river.
现在，把你的宝石鞋给我，不然你的狗就要成落水狗了

6
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:21,228
No, please! Take the slippers.
不！不要！请把鞋带走吧

7
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,241
I should have remembered.
我应该记起的

8
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:30,004
Those slippers will never come off
as long as you're alive.
这鞋在你活着的时候是没法脱下的

9
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:34,415
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?
放点火怎么样，稻草人？

10
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,019
No!
不！

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,654
Oh, I'm burning! I'm burning!
噢！我烧了！我烧了！

12
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,347
You cursed rat!
你这背运猫！

13
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:40,950
Look what you've done!
看看你干了啥

14
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,886
I'm melting. Melting!
我融化了，融化了！

15
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,831
- What a world!
- I didn't mean to kill her.
这个世界怎么了？
我并没想杀她。

16
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,121
Really, I didn't.
真的，我并没有

17
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:50,232
It's just that he was on fire.
那是因为它已经被烧着了

18
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:53,968
Hail to Dorothy.
The Wicked Witch is dead.
为桃乐丝欢呼吧，坏巫师消失了

19
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:57,233
Please, sir.
We've done what you've told us.
我们已经完成了你交给我们的任务，先生

20
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,740
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.
我们拿回了西方坏巫师的扫帚

21
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,277
- Can you send me home?
- You don't need to be helped any longer.
你可以送我们回家么
你以后不需要被帮助了

22
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,143
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.
你已经拥有回到堪萨斯的能力啊

23
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,407
I have?
是吗？

24
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:09,246
There's no place like home.
没有地方比家更亲切

25
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:11,715
There's no place like home.
没有地方比家更亲切

26
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:13,818
<i>There's no place like home.</i>
没有地方比家更亲切

27
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:17,495
<i>And then I was back here.</i>
然后我就回到了这里

28
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,862
Well, she's all right now. Thank heaven.
好的，她已经康复了，谢谢上帝。

29
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,658
But I wasn't all right, Aunt Em.
但我并没有完全恢复，艾姆阿姨

30
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,799
We were in terrible danger.
我们现在面临着强大危机

31
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,129
But we kept asking people to send us home.
但我们一直请求人们送我们回家

32
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,596
And they sent us home.
他们也确实送我们回来了

33
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:32,269
Doesn't anyone believe me?
没人相信我吗？

34
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:35,469
Anyway, it's all right
because I'm home again.
不过呢，我回来了，所以一切都会好的

35
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:38,748
And this is my room. And I love you all.
这是我的房间，我爱你们所有人

36
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:43,378
And, oh, Auntie Em,
there's no place like home.
而且，噢，艾姆阿姨
没有地方比家更亲切

37
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:48,325
I've heard Dorothy spin some yarns,
but that one takes the cake.
我听说桃乐丝经历很多奇闻轶事，
但那真是叫绝

38
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:51,585
Wicked witches, talking scarecrows, land,
坏巫师，会说话的稻草人，神奇大陆

39
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,924
what an imagination that child has!
这孩子的脑洞我是服的

40
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,863
They think I made it all up.
他们认为我是脑补的

41
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,525
If there was only someway
to make them believe.
如果这里有方法能让他们相信

42
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:03,834
Ruby slippers.
宝石鞋

43
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:07,441
Jerry, that's brilliant.
They'll have to believe me now.
杰瑞，太棒了
他们将必须相信我了

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,276
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, will you see...
亨利大叔，艾姆阿姨，你们看

45
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,939
Whoo-hoo!
- Yee-haw!
哇哦！
耶~哈~

46
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:14,241
Oh, no.
噢，不！

47
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,752
Reach for the sky, you peyotes.
上天吧！仙人掌们

48
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,947
Look at me. I'm a regular Buffalo Bill.
看我，我现在就是一个标准的布法罗比尔。

49
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,159
Where on earth did you get those things?
你们到底从哪儿获得这些装备的？

50
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:25,352
Ha ha! A traveling Wild West Show
got caught up in the twister.
哈哈，从龙卷风里得来的一场狂野西部游览秀

51
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:29,089
It dropped spangled saddles
and rhinestone boots all over the county.
在全州各地都有落下发光的鞍以及水钻鞋

52
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,666
Go back to work, you clowns.
回去工作吧，小丑们！

53
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:31,825
They farm's still in shambles
农场现在一团糟

54
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:32,993
and you're playing dress-up.
你们却在玩化妆舞会

55
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,263
Looky there, even Dorothy
got into the act.
看吧，甚至桃乐丝都要加入进来

56
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,006
It's okay, boys.
好了，少年们

57
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,636
We remember what really happened
and where we were.
我们要记得发生了什么，以及我们曾在哪儿

58
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:50,348
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

59
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:54,492
<i>Way up high</i>


60
00:02:55,092 --> 00:03:00,428
<i>There's a land that I've heard of</i>

61
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:05,231
<i>Once In a lullaby</i>

62
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:11,906
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

63
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:16,510
<i>Skies are blue</i>

64
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:23,285
<i>And the dreams
that you dare to dream</i>

65
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:27,582
<i>Really do come true</i>

67
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,527
Once again ol' straw-for-brains
is guarding the cornfield.
再一次的，稻草人又要巡视麦田了

68
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,326
What cornfield?
什么麦田？

69
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:16,398
Uhh, that twister sure didn't leave much.
嗯？那场龙卷风应该是没留下什么的

70
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,727
You ain't whistling Dixie.
We're still missing half our hogs.
你不是吹口哨的德克西
我们仍然丢失了一半的猪

71
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:24,338
Twisters'll make a mountain
out of a molehill.
龙卷风又要搞大新闻了

72
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:25,668
Twisters.
龙卷风

73
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:29,606
Ooh!
噢

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,282
Well, the good news is my Reverse
Cyclonotron is still in one piece.
好吧，好消息是我的反向回旋器还在一块

75
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,350
Your Cyclo... What's this?
你的回旋。。。是啥啊？

76
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,519
Reverse Cyclonotron.
反向回旋器

77
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,789
Now, say we get,
I don't know, another twister...
现在，说我知道的，我还不知道另一种旋转

78
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:42,517
Oh, don't even joke about that, Hickory.
席克里，不要对那个开玩笑

79
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,661
Well, this brilliant invention of mine
我这好顶赞的发明

80
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:48,457
will generate enough wind to blow that
twister right back where it came from.
会把龙卷风送回到它来的地方

81
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:52,034
It's full of wind all right,
just like its inventor.


82
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:05,982
Haha! That's got her.

83
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,998
Well, the yard's not going to
pick itself up.

84
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:33,573
<i>I've seen many different faces
The most exotic places</i>

85
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:38,008
<i>And lands that were lovely as could</i> be

86
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:42,611
<i>But in those worlds away
I kept dreaming of the day</i>

87
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:48,189
<i>I could come back to the place
that's meant for me</i>

88
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,487
<i>The roof keeps dripping
The paint': kind of chipping</i>

89
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,324
<i>There's no place like home</i>

90
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:00,536
<i>The cow's looking frail
and she can't fill</i> a <i>pail</i>

91
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:03,772
<i>There's no place like home</i>

92
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:07,304
<i>Silly spat between a cat and mouse</i>

93
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:09,879
<i>Leaves our house a mess</i>

94
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:13,576
<i>liable to go amiss</i>

95
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,413
<i>When you live at this address</i>

96
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:20,255
<i>The hay needs a-hauling
and the tractor is stalling</i>

97
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:23,457
<i>There's no place like home</i>

98
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:27,025
<i>But the folks on the land
always lend you a hand</i>

99
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,031
<i>There's no place like home</i>

100
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:33,434
<i>And when I'm singing to the Kansas sky</i>

101
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,470
<i>I don't know why I'd roam</i>

102
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,870
<i>Kansas slaps a smile
right across my face</i>

103
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:43,446
<i>There's no place like home</i>

104
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:47,345
<i>- No place like home</i>
<i>- No place like home</i>

105
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,111
<i>- There's no place like home</i>
- ALL: <i>No place like home</i>

106
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,186
<i>- There's no place like home</i>
- ALL: <i>No place like home</i>

107
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,449
<i>- There's no place like home</i>
- ALL: <i>No place like home</i>

108
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:59,692
<i>I check off a chore, only two dozen more</i>

109
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:02,589
<i>There's no place like home</i>

110
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:06,526
<i>In the sun or the storm
I'll be cozy and warm</i>

111
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:10,265
<i>There's no place like home</i>

112
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:15,902
<i>When I'm singing to the Kansas sky</i>

113
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:21,510
<i>I know why I don't roam</i>

114
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,346
<i>'Cause it slaps a smile
right across my face</i>

115
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,828
<i>There's no place like home</i>

116
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:35,899
<i>No place like home</i>

117
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,764
Whoa!

118
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:41,797
<i>- Load 'em up, boys.</i>
- Huh?

119
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,540
Get off our farm!

120
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,643
What in the world... Stop!

121
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,604
If you dare lay a finger
on our animals, I will...

122
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,680
- Dorothy, please.
- But, Uncle Henry,

123
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,315
they can't just come here and take...

124
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:59,318
I sympathize, neighbor Gale.
I surely do.

125
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,585
I was once a poor,
dirt-scratching farmer like yourself.

126
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,725
I know every penny counts.

127
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,498
But as that paper
from the sheriff clearly states,

128
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:12,336
<i>the law is on my side.</i>

129
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:16,063
I won't stand for this, Lucius Bibb.
You can't just be taking our animals.

130
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,205
If you dare lay a finger on them!

131
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,700
Oh, now, now, Miss Dorothy...

132
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:25,639
It seems during the recent tornado,
some of your uncle's pigs broke free

133
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,011
and devoured my entire watermelon patch.

134
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,380
And as you know,

135
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:35,989
I can't make Luscious Lucius'
world-famous watermelon barbeque sauce

136
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:37,991
<i>with empty melons, now, can I?</i>

137
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,688
Those aren't the only empty melons
he's got to worry about.

138
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:52,943
Whoa!

139
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:02,317
Fortunately, I have a solution
that will profit us all.

140
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:07,481
I'm running a big booth
at the Kansas State Fair.

141
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,989
<i>- I need meat, you need money.</i>

142
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:13,925
So, I'm willing to take my payment
in livestock.

143
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,729
Oh, you awful little troll!
Who gave you the right to...

144
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,664
- Now, Dorothy...
- But Uncle Henry you can't let him take...

145
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:20,461
Why don't you run along
and do your chores?

146
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,272
<i>This is grown-up business.</i>

147
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:25,975
Including these little nuggets.

148
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:28,810
Why, there's gotta be a way out of this.

149
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,414
Come on, everybody, think.
Use your brains.

150
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,847
<i>Oh, yes, we'll give you
all the eggs our hens lay for a <i>month.</i>

151
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,479
For free.

152
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,354
Yuck! I can't stand eggs.

153
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:45,524
The only thing a chicken is
good for is drumsticks.

154
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,059
You see? Mr. Tabby Cat agrees.

155
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,324
Can't you give us just a little more time?

156
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,296
I'll tell you what,

157
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,197
I'll give you 24 hours to

158
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,238
scrape together the cash.

159
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:03,370
If not, I'll cart off everything that
clucks, moos or oinks.

160
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,246
Well, I'm off to the fair.

161
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,213
Pleasure doing business with you.

162
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,248
Oh, you can keep the cat and mouse!

163
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,750
Well, there's nothing we can do
but go into town and re-mortgage the farm.

164
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,687
- Again.
- Ah, we're drowning in debt as it is.

165
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,900
We'll all pitch in Mrs. Gale.
We can get odd jobs in town.

166
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,070
- Sure, I can chop wood.
- And I can punch cattle.

167
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:28,771
And I can hammer, and paint, and saw.

168
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,476
You could stay here, small fry.

169
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:36,076
Oh, but, Uncle Henry, I wanna help, too.

170
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,839
<i>You can help by watching the farm.</i>

171
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:39,914
<i>That's a big enough job for you.</i>

172
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,016
But this is my home, too.

173
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:44,914
I want to help save it. I know I can.

174
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:48,553
- This is grown-up business, Dorothy.
- Oh, I'm 15.

175
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,451
Practically.

176
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,187
In eight months.

177
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,725
- If you really wanna help...
- Yes?

178
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:56,591
Just stay out of trouble.

179
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,595
Boys, keep an eye on her.

180
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,430
That's all they think I can do.

181
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,265
Come on, boys, let's go.

182
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,004
Toto and I will take the house.

183
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,443
Tom, Jerry, you've got the barn.

184
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,683
Maybe we could fix those windows.

185
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,145
That'd show Auntie Em and Uncle Henry.

186
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,324
This is creepy, Toto.

187
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:36,034
You're right. I have a funny feeling
I should keep these close.

188
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,438
What's going on in here?

189
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:29,612
<i>Help!</i>

190
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,579
<i>- Oh, no. Help!</i>

191
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:44,964
Let me go!

192
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,466
Oh, you terrible...

193
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,927
Jiminy Crickets!
How do you steer this thing?

194
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:23,601
Whoa!

195
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,953
- I got you.
- Scarecrow, it's you.

196
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,780
Actually, it's all of us.

197
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:44,620
Oh, Tin Man. Lion.

198
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:47,458
Hi, there, kiddo.

199
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,889
We better save the hellos
until we get rid of him.

200
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:56,164
Look out!

201
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,945
Where did he come from?

202
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,249
From Oz, the same as us.

203
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,549
Though getting back there might be tricky.

204
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,447
Until we do, let's have a look around.

205
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,685
So, this is the famous Kansas.

206
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,322
Not as bright and shiny as I expected.

207
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:22,027
-It's rather...
- Drab.

208
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,797
Kinda scary.

209
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:27,764
Oh, I don't know.
The locals look friendly enough.

210
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,765
Morning, friend, how's the view up there?

211
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,280
Hmm, no need to act stuck up.

212
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,407
I must say,
it's wonderful to see you again,

213
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,277
but what are you doing here?

214
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:44,711
We had to come.

215
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,220
- There's big trouble back in Oz.
- Terrible trouble.

216
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,914
It happened soon after you left.

217
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,254
- On our very first Dorothy Day.
- Dorothy Day?

218
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,793
Why, of course. You're our national hero.

219
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,400
Oh, me?

220
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,995
There we were in the town square.

221
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,507
Citizens of Oz,

222
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,676
though our good friend,
Dorothy Gale has returned to Kansas,

223
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,106
we've built this statue in her honor.

224
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:18,021
And thanks to Glinda's magic potion,

225
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:20,917
<i>we can bring the statue to life
for a whole day.</i>

226
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,025
Oh, it will bejust like
the kid was here in person.

227
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,628
And remind us of all the
good things she brought to Oz.

228
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,398
<i>Things like peace,</i>

229
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,998
freedom, happiness and monkeys.

230
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,304
- Monkeys?
- Yeah, monkeys.

231
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:38,668
Monkeys!

232
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:44,507
Whoa!

233
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:46,543
Who's that? Who's that?

234
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,282
I don't understand,
with the Wicked Witch gone,

235
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,048
<i>the monkeys have no reason to attack.</i>

236
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:56,587
Tell them that.

237
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:04,328
Oh, dear! I hereby banish
you monkeys to the end of... Oh...

238
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:12,641
- Cut it out!
- Pick on someone your own size!

239
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:23,849
Put 'em up, put 'em up.
I'll ride you airsick banana addicts.

240
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,556
Who's first?
I'll take you all on. One at a time.

241
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,820
One at a time.
One at a time.

242
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,803
Come back and fight, you big cowards.

243
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,732
Hey! Let me out. This ain't over, see.

244
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,397
Whoa!

245
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,838
What's happening?

246
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,671
<i>Oh, it's an earthquake!</i>

247
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:53,405
Whoa!

248
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:01,588
And all this didn't compare
to what happened next.

249
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,624
Oh, what did happen next?

250
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:08,058
That is when I decided
to take the bull by the horns.

251
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,091
Ain't that right, Scarecrow?

252
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,799
I haven't any idea
what you're talking about.

253
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,497
Me neither.

254
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,170
Please, fellas, tell me what happened.

255
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,807
Well, out came a horrible bunch of nomes,

256
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,140
<i>followed by the Nome King.</i>

257
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,747
Tell me when it's over.

258
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,414
Ruggedo, you cannot do this.

259
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,782
Oh, give me back my wand.

260
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:39,895
If anyone's going to wave that wand,
Glinda dear, it's going to be me.

261
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,857
Oh. Oh, no. You can't do this.

262
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,627
Boys, I'd like to converse
with the Strawman.

263
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:57,604
What do you want, Ruggedo?

264
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:02,215
That's Mr. Ruggedo to you, brainiac.

265
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:05,055
And it's not about what I want,

266
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,121
it's about what I get.

267
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:08,414
See?

268
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:10,754
And there's only one more thing I want.

269
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:14,624
To destroy that upstart, Dorothy Gale.

270
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,693
Me? But why?

271
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,158
I've never even met any Nome King.

272
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:22,263
You've made quite a reputation
for yourself in Oz.

273
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,373
With the way you've been
bumpin' off wicked witches,

274
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,939
you're the one to beat.

275
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,509
After the Nome King threw us
in the dungeon,

276
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,238
Glinda used the last of her magic
to help us escape.

277
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:35,783
<i>Ruggedo was using his powers
to make a tunnel to Kansas.</i>

278
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,481
We followed his flying monkeys
to warn you.

279
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:41,849
But that still doesn't explain
why he would want to destroy me.

280
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,626
The ruby slippers?

281
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:49,163
Glinda did say their magic
is very powerful.

282
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,322
That figures.

283
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,501
The Nome King scouring Oz

284
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,128
for every magical doodad
he can lay his grubby hands on.

285
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:58,034
He's a most unpleasant character.

286
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,739
It seems only his great fear of the Wizard
kept him underground.

287
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,841
The Wizard.

288
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,210
He would know how to defeat the Nome King.

289
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:11,978
<i>But the Wizard flew away
in his balloon.</i>

290
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,781
He could be anywhere.

291
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,590
<i>Or nowhere.</i>

292
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,288
<i>How could he be nowhere?</i>

293
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,464
<i>He's a wizard. He could do anything.</i>

294
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,100
Think, everyone. I'm sure the answer
is staring us right in the face.

295
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:26,759
There it is.

296
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,505
"Oz, the great and powerful

297
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,766
"appearing for a limited engagement
at the Kansas State Fair."

298
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:34,041
Why, that's just down the road in Topeka.

299
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,872
If we can get the Wizard to return to Oz,

300
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:39,172
I'm sure he'll set everything right.

301
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,941
I know.
We'll go with you to show you the way.

302
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,716
You're right, Jerry.
Our friends would attract

303
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,721
a lot of attention here in Kansas.

304
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:53,320
There. That's perfect.

305
00:21:53,697 --> 00:21:56,894
Uh, uh, does this make me look fat?

306
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,525
Allow me.

307
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:01,737
Oh, snug.

308
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:06,666
We'll take the old tractor,
trailer and all.

309
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:09,104
No. But why?

310
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,683
I know they think I'm just a kid.

311
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:16,452
But I can do this. I know it.

312
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,647
Oh, won't you let me try?
I'll let you drive.

313
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,971
Oh, we can't go anywhere.
The tractor's out of gas.

314
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:44,413
You have to put fluid into a machine
to make it run.

315
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,606
Hmm. What a strange concept.

316
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,716
Well, this is Kansas, Tin Man.

317
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:51,544
Machines can't run themselves
like they do in Oz.

318
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,221
Oh, but they will.

319
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,406
Whoa-whee!

320
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,268
That stuff's got a kick to it.

321
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:14,341
Real high octane.

322
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,579
Oh, my silvers feel brand new.

323
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:19,408
Oh, what have you done?

324
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:22,142
Solved our transportation problem.

325
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,950
Oh, Miss Tractor,
would you drive us to the fair?

326
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,684
Please?

327
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:32,962
Whoa, Nelly!
Ain't you a fine bit of craftsmanship.

328
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:35,424
Oh. Oh, please.

329
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:37,191
You'll make me tarnish.

330
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:38,999
Hop on, handsome.

331
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,759
Everyone, let's go.

332
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:44,734
I ain't had this much pep
in my pistons for years.

333
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:48,669
Now, hands off the steering wheel,
pussycat. I'm driving. And...

334
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:53,943
Stop pushing my pedals, mousey,
'cause it tickles.

335
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:00,984
Here we go again,
off on another whirlwind adventure.

336
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,824
Whoa-ho!

337
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,686
You got to watch them bumps.

338
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:08,692
Whoa!

339
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,966
Scarecrow, look at you.

340
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,327
It's okay.

341
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:14,596
I always wanted to be a hayride.

342
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:20,841
<i>We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>

343
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,344
<i>We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
if ever a wiz there was</i>

344
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:28,380
<i>If ever oh ever a wiz there was
the Wizard of Oz is one because</i>

345
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:31,677
<i>Because, because, because
because, because</i>

346
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,055
<i>Because of the wonderful things he does</i>

347
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,617
<i>We're off to see the Wizard</i>

348
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:40,262
<i>The wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>

349
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,739
All off for the State Fair.

350
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,846
Oh! Land of ghosts, what a trip.

351
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:02,346
My cylinders need a siesta.

352
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,610
Now, go easy on the corndogs,
little missy.

353
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:07,518
You know how your aunt feels
about snackin' 'tween meals.

354
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:09,450
I will. Thank you.

355
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:11,751
<i>Come on in and see every sight.</i>

356
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,462
Now, this must be the real Kansas.

357
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:18,324
Oh, it's bright and shiny,
just like the Emerald City.

358
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:22,460
And everything smells like fried dough.

359
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:23,829
- Ah.
- Yum.

360
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,234
<i>Right this way,
come one, come all.</i>

361
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,878
Everyone answer the carny man's call.

362
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,036
Wonders await you just inside.

363
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,841
Wonders to leave you starry-eyed.

364
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,248
Let's see that's one, two,
three, four, five, six dollars entry fee.

365
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:41,753
Cats and mice, tonight half-price.

366
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,057
Six dollars?
But we haven't got any money.

367
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:47,890
Mmm-hmm. Thanks for coming. Drive safely.

368
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,264
If we can't pay, we can't get in.

369
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:55,368
All I have are a few
Emerald City emeralds.

370
00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:59,308
They're probably worthless here.

371
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:00,667
Emeralds, chief?

372
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:04,205
<i>Well, aren't you the lucky few</i>

373
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,180
<i>'Cause I can pull a string or two</i>

374
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:10,317
I'm Calvin Carney.

375
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,313
<i>Showman extraordinaire</i>

376
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:18,390
<i>And I'm gonna tell you all about</i>

377
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:23,088
<i>This mighty fine affair</i>

378
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:27,001
<i>Feast your eyes and claim your prize</i>

379
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,069
<i>You're in for quite a treat</i>

380
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:31,797
<i>A meager fee to come with me</i>

381
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,134
<i>And sample something sweet</i>

382
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,977
<i>Oh, can't you feel it poppin'</i>

383
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,774
<i>So feverishly fun</i>

384
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,244
<i>And there's no sign of stoppin'</i>

385
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:44,680
<i>- The party's just begun</i>
- Ah.

386
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,583
<i>Take a taste</i>

387
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,589
<i>- 'Cause we got so much cooking</i>

388
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,120
<i>Step inside the hottest joint in town</i>

389
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,689
<i>There's magic in the makin'</i>

390
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,834
<i>And there's music in the air</i>

391
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,505
<i>Come, my friend, and come attend</i>

392
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,175
<i>A mighty fine affair</i>

393
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:08,774
<i>- Whoa, whoa
- Whoa, whoa</i>

394
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>A mighty fine affair</i>

395
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,948
<i>- Whoa, whoa
- Whoa, whoa</i>

396
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:16,387
<i>A mighty fine affair</i>

397
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:19,120
<i>Get your fill of every thrill</i>

398
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:21,313
<i>Come on and drink the cup</i>

399
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:24,222
<i>- Oh, kids you're in for quite a spin</i>
- ALL: <i>Whoa!</i>

400
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,488
<i>So, you better buckle up</i>

401
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:29,460
<i>- Start jivin' with the action</i>
- CHORUS: <i>Jivin'with the action</i>

402
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:32,124
<i>- We're flyin' free and fast</i>
- CHORUS: <i>Free and fast</i>

403
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:38,032
<i>And every new attraction
is better than the last</i>

404
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,106
<i>There it is!</i>

405
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,308
<i>Are you the great?</i>

406
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,009
<i>Come on, everybody.</i>

407
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:46,337
<i>Whoo!</i>

408
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:49,684
<i>Take a taste 'cause we got so much kickin'</i>

409
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,253
<i>Take a taste
'cause we got so much kickin'</i>

410
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,914
<i>Step inside the hottest joint in town</i>

411
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,786
<i>Step inside the hottest joint</i>

412
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,085
<i>There's magic in the makin'</i>

413
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,957
<i>And there's music in the air</i>

414
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,727
<i>Yes, indeed, it's guaranteed</i>

415
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,958
<i>And as my guest, you'll get my best</i>

416
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,037
<i>And now you know I always throw</i>

417
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:14,574
<i>- A mighty fine affair</i>

418
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,209
<i>- Whoa, whoa
- Whoa, whoa</i>

419
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:23,277
<i>A mighty fine affair</i>

420
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,750
<i>Now, I say the magic words,</i>

421
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:32,094
<i>uh, nimbus cumulus destructus.</i>

422
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:35,262
Look, there he is.

423
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,325
Oh, that ain't nothin'.

424
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,201
We had a big tornado rip through
our back forty a couple of weeks ago.

425
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,307
Can't you do any real magic?

426
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:49,045
Real magic, you say?

427
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:52,881
Ah, the very thing.

428
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:54,712
Prism seeds.

429
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,452
I say the magic words,

430
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:59,553
<i>botanicus borealis, and presto!</i>

431
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,483
Rainbow poppies!

432
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,256
The national flower of Munchkin Land.

433
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:06,722
Huh?

434
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,159
Yes, thank you.

435
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:09,626
And, uh, thank you.

436
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:14,269
I ain't clappin'. My leg's asleep.

437
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,765
- This guy is...
- Let's get outta here.

438
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,267
Who do I see about a refund?

439
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,870
Oh, what do they know?
I thought your show was wonderful.

440
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:23,923
Well, Dorothy, my dear.

441
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:25,291
It's us.

442
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,959
Oh, my goodness, it's everyone.

443
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:31,252
Tom, and Jerry, and Toto, too.

444
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,516
We've come to take you back to Oz.

445
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,117
What? And give up showbiz?

446
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,928
You can have your phony flowers back.
They smell funny.

447
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:43,088
Oh, that'll wash out. Uh, probably.

448
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,703
Yes. Well, in truth, I am growing weary
of the carnival circuit.

449
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,271
Uh, the folks hereabouts
just don't crave Oz-style magic.

450
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:54,908
Well, you know who does.

451
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,236
The Nome King.

452
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,537
Ruggedo?

453
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,705
Oh, don't tell me
that grizzled old gopher is back.

454
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,749
Yes, and meaner than ever.

455
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:04,885
He's seized control of the Emerald City.

456
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,189
Then we'll just seize it right back.

457
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,353
Boys, fetch my thaumaturgical portmanteau.

458
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:16,663
There. My magic bag.

459
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:31,206
No time to dawdle, my lads.

460
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,778
How will we get back to Oz?

461
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:34,815
Oh-ho! Well, that's no problem.

462
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:38,214
I have my trusty balloon
tethered right out back.

463
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,280
All aboard.

464
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:45,223
First-class accommodations for everybody.

465
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:49,489
Ooh! If this is first class,
I'd hate to see coach.

466
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:52,930
<i>What do we do now?</i>

467
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:57,163
We simply wait for the next tornado
to sweep us away to Oz.

468
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:00,534
There should be another whirlwind along
in three to five weeks.

469
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,705
Can't your magic speed things up?

470
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,813
I'm sorry, but the only tornado
I can summon is bottle sized.

471
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,479
Of course, if I had some way
of making it bigger, I... Why I...

472
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,123
Oh! I know!

473
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,261
Don't we have enough tornados
in these parts?

474
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:21,762
Oh! This has to work.

475
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:28,003
Tornado bottle, please!

476
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,468
Uh, just a drop or two should do it.

477
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:40,975
<i>Oh, yikes!</i>

478
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:43,049
It's a regular monsoon!

479
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:50,386
Twister!

480
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,795
Well, look at all them hungry fairgoers.

481
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:03,436
Line up, folks!

482
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:07,075
I got plenty of baby backs for everyone!

483
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:10,469
Great hell in hot links!

484
00:32:12,882 --> 00:32:16,113
Hey!
Good grub on this flight!

485
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,127
This is it! Next stop, Oz!

486
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:29,497
And I pray we're not too late.

487
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:39,239
<i>All hail!
All hail!</i>

488
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,410
<i>That a notable nome has come to town</i>

489
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:44,041
<i>A fellow fit to carry the crown</i>

490
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:46,611
<i>He's rising up, we're bowing down</i>

491
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:49,581
<i>The very scary, wonderfully hairy</i>

492
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:51,776
<i>Nome King</i>

493
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,159
An accent on the King!

494
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,921
<i>Nome King!</i>

495
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:03,398
That's much better. Yes, thank you!

496
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,965
<i>I've plotted many years
to take my place upon the throne</i>

497
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:12,163
<i>My friends, it now appears
the throne is mine and mine alone</i>

498
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:16,570
<i>So, now, you're gonna see
how fun it's gonna be</i>

499
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,372
<i>When all of Oz's citizens
are slaves to you and me</i>

500
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:24,680
<i>The Ozians are known
to be oppressive and unkind</i>

501
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,948
<i>They've stolen every stone
and precious emerald that we've mined</i>

502
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:33,424
<i>And none of it was earned
So, they shouldn't be concerned</i>

503
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:39,330
<i>For I will stop at nothing
'ti! what's mine has been returned</i>

504
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:43,934
<i>Welcome to the new Emerald City</i>

505
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,674
<i>Let the bells of doom start to ring</i>

506
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:53,010
<i>For no one dares to doubt
the destruction I will bring</i>

507
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:56,617
<i>What's mine is mine, I'm the King</i>

508
00:33:57,253 --> 00:34:00,780
<i>What's his is his, he's the King</i>

509
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:05,125
<i>There's a tiny problem, though
We a slightly worthy foe</i>

510
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:08,422
<i>Who may prove to be a hiccup in my plan</i>

511
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,092
<i>- She slayed the witches
- She tamed the lion</i>

512
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,301
<i>Clicked her heels and started flying</i>

513
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:16,504
<i>H! steal her powers any way I can</i>

514
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,466
<i>gettin' in my way</i>

515
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:25,741
<i>Now, let me hear the people say</i>

516
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,518
<i>Welcome to the new Emerald City</i>

517
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:32,183
That's the spirit, boys!

518
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,014
<i>Such a sorry song that they sing</i>

519
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:36,691
But it makes me happy.

520
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:41,194
<i>And no one dares to doubt
the destruction I will bring</i>

521
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,698
<i>What's his is his</i>

522
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,831
<i>What's mine is mine</i>

523
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:47,833
<i>What's his is his</i>

524
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:51,004
<i>- Because I am the King</i>
- ALL: <i>Because he is the King</i>

525
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,733
<i>He's the King, he's the King</i>

526
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,344
<i>King, King, King, King, King, King, King</i>

527
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:00,983
<i>King!</i>

528
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:11,993
I hope you brought
the rest of the witches' magical relics.

529
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,256
Ooh, right here, sir.

530
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:16,158
Just as you commanded.

531
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:19,964
Oh, ah! Good, good!

532
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:22,634
Oh, her potions, her spells.

533
00:35:22,805 --> 00:35:26,332
Everything I'll need
to finish that Dorothy forever.

534
00:35:26,642 --> 00:35:29,771
What's shakin', King?
Let me out and let's agitate.

535
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:32,307
I've heard about this bug.

536
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:34,273
I'll save him for later.

537
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:37,511
Useful, but still not what I need.

538
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:39,416
I want those ruby slippers!

539
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:43,183
I won't rest until the sparkling beauties
are on my feet.

540
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,561
All this because he wants
a pair of red pumps?

541
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:50,197
Don't judge, new 9W-

542
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:54,501
Oh-ho! Here's a beaut, Your Nomeship.

543
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:56,669
Enchanted owl eggs.

544
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,030
Eggs!

545
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,038
Nomes hate eggs.

546
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:02,303
We're deathly allergic.

547
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:06,240
Sorry, maybe that should have
been covered in orientation.

548
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,879
Crash that balloon!

549
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:10,549
Dispose of everyone on board!

550
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,017
But bring me the ruby slippers.

551
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,154
Uh, begging your pardon, Your Nomeship,

552
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:19,585
but what's so special
about those ruby slippers?

553
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:22,830
I don't recall
giving you permission to speak!

554
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,491
No, sir.

555
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:29,066
But since you asked, as Nome King,

556
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,932
my domain is the land beneath Oz.

557
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:33,731
That figures.

558
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,512
All its mineral treasures are mine.

559
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,608
Makes sense.

560
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:41,043
Including its jewels.

561
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,279
Of course.

562
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:49,654
My soft-hearted father,
the previous Nome King,

563
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,156
gave away emeralds to make this city.

564
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:54,795
And magical rubies for the ruby slippers.

565
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,296
I want them back!

566
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,896
But if you take the emeralds back,

567
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:03,298
that means you'd have to move
the entire city.

568
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,607
Underground.

569
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:10,678
Which I will do, once the power
of the ruby slippers is mine to command.

570
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,847
That won't be long now.

571
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:18,343
Oh-ho! We made it!

572
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:21,721
Oh no! Look!

573
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:25,917
Oh no!

574
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:28,389
Stand by to repel borders!

575
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:39,138
Oh, no!

576
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,009
No!

577
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,379
And don't come back!

578
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,482
Let go!

579
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:53,985
<i>Oh my!</i>

580
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,590
Hold on!

581
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:17,506
Good shooting, ace!

582
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:21,312
This hurts me more than
it does you, monkeys!

583
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,152
Ooh, that's gonna hurt too.

584
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:28,818
Ah! Oh!

585
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:30,216
Never fear!

586
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,986
I'll repair it with
my Magical Stick 'em Stuff.

587
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:36,665
<i>One blast should do it.</i>

588
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,497
That's stickin' it to 'em.

589
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,674
Oh, no. They're carrying us away!

590
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,136
Bail out!

591
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,689
Uh, it's springy! Whoa!

592
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,524
<i>Are you okay, Tom?</i>

593
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:11,889
Oh-ho! Unhand me, you primeval...
Primates!

594
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,067
Unhand me!

595
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,494
Wizard!

596
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:18,933
Go on without me,
I'll join you when I can!

597
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:20,601
If I can.

598
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,416
Well, I'm certain he'll be okay.

599
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,177
Sure. He's a wizard, right?

600
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:32,377
Ha! Wizard deluxe.

601
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,645
Yeah. He's fine!

602
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:39,525
Well, it's up to us
to carry on without him.

603
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,753
Anyone know where we are?

604
00:39:42,898 --> 00:39:44,559
It's the Ferocious Forest.

605
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,269
The Munchkin River
is just beyond those trees.

606
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,495
Oh! Why, that river runs
right through the Emerald City.

607
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:52,937
I'll cut some wood for a raft.

608
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:57,304
And we'll float in right
under the Nome King's gnarly nose hairs.

609
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,304
"Gnarly"?

610
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:02,577
I call it the ruffled, rugged look.

611
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:06,083
I could let them sail into my clutches.

612
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:08,450
But that Dorothy girl is tricky.

613
00:40:08,624 --> 00:40:11,389
Unlikely as it seems,
she could find a way to stop me.

614
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:16,395
Being the Nome King and all,
you could attack them from underground.

615
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,167
Did I ask for ideas?

616
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:23,795
No, sir.

617
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,464
But that's not bad.

618
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:28,167
If I can delay them,

619
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,004
I'll grab Dorothy
before she reaches the river.

620
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:33,444
What's jumpin', Jackson?

621
00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:36,516
- I've got a job for you.
- Ha!

622
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:39,786
<i>A frail, a bale, a pail,
and four flea-bitten tails.</i>

623
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:43,724
I need you to stall them
as only a Jitterbug can.

624
00:40:44,126 --> 00:40:45,218
No big, Kingy.

625
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,656
Those cats out there,
it's right out of theirjiving pants.

626
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,661
Pop the plugsy, Mugsy.

627
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,924
Milliweedy, millirooney.

628
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:55,365
Dig you later, King, and soon-ey.

629
00:40:57,339 --> 00:40:59,273
This sure is a creepy place.

630
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:03,708
Excuse me, this is my home.
It ain't creepy.

631
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,769
It's terrifying.

632
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:11,710
Oh, what's that?

633
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:15,784
Well, all right. Root-eroony.

634
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,325
<i>The Jitterbugsy coming
to drive you all loony</i>

635
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:21,087
<i>Did you just hear what I just heard?</i>

636
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:25,958
<i>That noise don't come
from no ordinary bird</i>

637
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:31,198
<i>It may be just a cricket
or a critter in the trees</i>

638
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:36,106
<i>Giving me the jitters
in the joints around my knees</i>

639
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:41,441
<i>I think lsee a pigeon
and it's fuzzing and it's furry</i>

640
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,982
<i>I haven't got a brain
but I think I ought to worry</i>

641
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,720
<i>I haven't got a heart
but I have a palpitation</i>

642
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,254
<i>It's not a cup of flowers
I don't like this situation</i>

643
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,756
<i>Are you gonna stand around
and let him fill us full of horror?</i>

644
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:55,256
<i>I'd like to roar him down</i>

645
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:57,896
<i>But I think I lost my roarer</i>

646
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,166
<i>- It's a who's-is
- It's a who's-is?</i>

647
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:06,467
<i>- It's a what's-is
- ALL: It's a what's-is</i>

648
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:08,267
<i>- Who's that?
- Who's that?</i>

649
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:10,102
<i>- Who's that?
- Who's that?</i>

650
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:14,574
<i>Who's that hiding in the treetops?</i>

651
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:17,147
<i>It's that rascal</i>

652
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:18,713
<i>The Jitterbug</i>

653
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:23,481
<i>Should you catch him buzzing round you</i>

654
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,591
<i>Keep away from</i>

655
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,124
<i>The Jitterbug</i>

656
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:30,355
<i>Oh, the bats, and the bees
and the breeze in the trees</i>

657
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,294
<i>Have a terrible, horrible buzz</i>

658
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,629
<i>But the bats, and the bees
and the breeze in the trees</i>

659
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,498
<i>Couldn't do what the Jitterbug does</i>

660
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:40,400
<i>So, be careful of that rascal</i>

661
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,412
<i>Keep away from</i>

662
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:44,568
<i>The Jitterbug</i>

663
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,372
Ah, that joint is jumping now.

664
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:48,380
<i>Oh, the jitter</i>

665
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,585
<i>Oh, the bug</i>

666
00:42:51,286 --> 00:42:54,586
<i>Oh, the Jitterbug
bug-a-bug, bug-a-bug, boo!</i>

667
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:56,916
<i>In the twitter</i>

668
00:42:57,726 --> 00:42:58,750
<i>In the throes</i>

669
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,151
Ooh, you're cooking now.

670
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:04,129
<i>Oh, the critters got me dancing
on 1,000 toes</i>

671
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:08,301
<i>There she blows</i>

672
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,502
Lookin' good!

673
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,233
Hope you like dancing!

674
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,770
Without might, it's a current affair.

675
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:37,991
Whoa! Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait!

676
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,300
This is mystifying, mortifying.

677
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:42,503
Quite absurd, embarrassing.

678
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:45,402
Exasperating, even awkward.

679
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:49,240
Hey, now, Kansas, don't put me on ice.

680
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:52,708
Jitterbug's honor, I swear! I'll be nice.

681
00:43:53,148 --> 00:43:54,547
Maybe if you behave.

682
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,111
Wait--
- Thanks, boys.

683
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,349
What are you doing?

684
00:43:58,754 --> 00:43:59,915
The spell is broken.

685
00:44:00,122 --> 00:44:02,784
Don't stop me now, Jackson.
I'm cooking with gas.

686
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:04,382
<i>Oh, the jitter</i>

687
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,891
Let's get out of here
before anything else happens.

688
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,562
There's the river.

689
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:18,634
What's happening?

690
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:20,631
- Oh, no! Not again!
- Earthquake!

691
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:27,315
Dorothy!

692
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:29,917
Gah!

693
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:31,481
Hang on!

694
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:33,352
Oh! Oh my!

695
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,357
Look out!

696
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:49,129
Oh, that's underhanded,
at the very least undergrounded.

697
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:53,604
I hate playing the villain.

698
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,674
But a job's a job.

699
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,036
Throw him in the river.

700
00:44:57,212 --> 00:44:59,340
Ah! Don't do that! I'll rust!

701
00:45:00,015 --> 00:45:02,040
Even worse, I'll sink!

702
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,548
Oh! We got you, Tinny!

703
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,017
Here we go, being naughty again.

704
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:11,191
You kiddies may want to
close your eyes now.

705
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:12,689
Okay, you names.

706
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:14,621
Let's shake it.

707
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:17,655
Whoa!

708
00:45:20,168 --> 00:45:21,158
That's a stretch!

709
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:33,776
Help!

710
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:36,983
I... I can't swim!

711
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,199
Grab the rope!
Hook it around the Tin Man.

712
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:54,493
We'll do the rest.

713
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:30,762
Hang on, Toto.

714
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:36,303
Looks like your friends escaped, missy.

715
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:38,502
But you won't be so lucky.

716
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:41,106
Take them to the Nome King.

717
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:49,881
Why, I've got an idea.
Play along.

718
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:53,926
Careful, Dorothy. It's cramped in here.

719
00:46:54,162 --> 00:46:57,826
You know those nomes
can't make really big tunnels.

720
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,390
Can't make a big tunnel?

721
00:47:00,602 --> 00:47:03,970
Listen, straw head,
you could run a train through here.

722
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:06,698
Why, I've seen bigger gopher holes
in our carrot patch.

723
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,742
Ohh! Is that so? Jump to it, nomes.

724
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,887
There, how do you like that, missy?

725
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:38,336
Careful, men. We don't want to start a--

726
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:41,400
Cave-in.

727
00:48:03,498 --> 00:48:05,091
<i>That was very brave.</i>

728
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:06,698
Are you all right?

729
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:14,666
And they call my ticker noisy.

730
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:20,473
Your Highness, allow me to present
Jerry Mouse of Kansas.

731
00:48:20,715 --> 00:48:21,910
Charmed, I'm sure.

732
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,815
<i>Jerry, meet my good friend,
the Mouse Queen of Oz.</i>

733
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:32,126
I must say, Kansas mice
have impeccable manners.

734
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:35,829
We have to get to the Emerald City
as fast as possible.

735
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:38,900
But I'm still a little rusty.

736
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:41,897
Bring my coach.

737
00:48:51,713 --> 00:48:54,705
I would be honored
if you would ride with me.

738
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:12,860
At least, they're out of trouble.

739
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,535
But we can't swim the river.

740
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:21,438
So, we'll have to take the long way,
through the forest.

741
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:27,576
I was once what you are, Tom, my boy.

742
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:31,912
Yeah, I wasn't always
the steadfast hero type you see today.

743
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,088
No-o-o!

744
00:49:34,322 --> 00:49:35,653
Now it's my turn

745
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,383
to help a fellow feline become fearless.

746
00:49:41,262 --> 00:49:43,594
It's a good thing we ditched those guards.

747
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:46,460
Now, we can sneak into
the Emerald City undetected.

748
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:48,328
Maybe if we go to the Wizard's Palace,

749
00:49:48,536 --> 00:49:50,868
we might find something
magical to help us.

750
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,734
- Oh! That's a great idea.
- Come on.

751
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,410
We made it.

752
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:42,022
And the Nome King has no idea we're here.

753
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:45,921
Well, you gotta get up pretty early
in the morning to outsmart me.

754
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:50,255
My brain is just too sharp
for his corny traps.

755
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,572
Well, as I live and breathe.

756
00:50:58,072 --> 00:50:59,767
It's the brainiac.

757
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:04,241
And Miss Goody Two-shoes,
all caught in the same trap.

758
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,745
<i>You may notice a few changes around here.</i>

759
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:17,922
Did I ever tell you when I took on
an entire herd of elephants? Hmm?

760
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:20,322
I just look 'em straight in the eye. Yup.

761
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:22,690
Them beady little red eyes.

762
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:27,433
I knew I was surrounded, so I gave 'em
the old one-two-four.

763
00:51:27,936 --> 00:51:30,701
Yep, nothing gets past
my cat-like reflexes.

764
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:35,072
Then again, you know that.

765
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:36,607
You're a cat.

766
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:39,403
Hey. You're not Tom.

767
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:42,075
But if you're not Tom, that means...

768
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,320
Carry the two...

769
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,816
Jiminy Crickets! He's gone!

770
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:53,851
Spooks!

771
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,592
I don't believe in spooks,
I don't believe in spooks.

772
00:51:57,765 --> 00:51:59,893
I don't believe in spooks,
I don't believe in spooks.

773
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,435
Oh!

774
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:07,599
Oh, imagine me,
getting all spooked over spooks.

775
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:10,308
Those preposterous...

776
00:52:10,912 --> 00:52:13,438
Why, they're nothing
but little old red lightbulbs.

777
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:15,211
Right guys?

778
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,740
Oh!

779
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:39,674
Oh, we're in quite a pickle.

780
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:43,166
- What do we do now, Dorothy?
- I don't know.

781
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:45,778
Uncle Henry and Auntie Em
are always telling me

782
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,711
I'm too young
and to stay out of everyone's way.

783
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:52,681
And now, I'm starting to think
that they were right.

784
00:52:56,524 --> 00:53:00,688
Oh, don't say things like that.
You can't mean it.

785
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:02,260
Oh, why not?

786
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:05,121
Because you're Dorothy.

787
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,094
You always find a way.

788
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:14,608
Well, okay.
I'll let you off this time easy,

789
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:18,504
since you didn't realize
you was dealing with the king of the...

790
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:20,236
Well, well, well.

791
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:23,513
Look what cat they dragged in.

792
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:25,845
That couldn't be
the ex-King of the Forest.

793
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:28,121
<i>You know, boys,
I'm very disappointed in you.</i>

794
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:30,551
You were supposed to
bring back some meat.

795
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,624
Not a big cream puff!

796
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:35,622
That's Mr. Ex-Cream Puff to you.

797
00:53:35,897 --> 00:53:39,663
Besides, everyone knows
I'm the real King of the Forest.

798
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:42,594
Oh, then this must be
one of your royal subjects?

799
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:45,167
- Tom?
- You see, I'm on a "seefood" diet.

800
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:47,102
I eat what I see.

801
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:49,171
I eat what I see. Seefood!

802
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:51,709
Well, you can't intimidate us
with these cruel methods.

803
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:53,037
Me and Tomcat

804
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:55,113
can take all you can <i>dish</i> out.

805
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:58,416
They say you've been off fightin' witches.

806
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,188
That sounds pretty phony.

807
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:03,117
The only witches you've ever finished
were sandwiches.

808
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:05,119
Baloney!

809
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,958
Listen, I'm runnin' this forest now.

810
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,358
So, scat, fraidy cat!

811
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:13,632
Everybody knows that
tigers can't be King of the Forest,

812
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:15,303
especially you.

813
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:16,995
Oh. yeah?

814
00:54:17,238 --> 00:54:19,900
So, you were
the King of the Forest?

815
00:54:20,074 --> 00:54:22,304
<i>- And you think you can tell me what to do</i>

816
00:54:22,477 --> 00:54:25,003
Listen up, former King of the Forest

817
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:26,903
<i>Have I</i> got some news for you

818
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,080
<i>There's a new cat in town</i>

819
00:54:31,552 --> 00:54:32,951
<i>Who's most fit for</i>

820
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:36,484
<i>Most deserving of the crown</i>

821
00:54:36,658 --> 00:54:39,684
You? You ain't fit for anything.

822
00:54:39,894 --> 00:54:41,157
Boo!

823
00:54:42,563 --> 00:54:44,224
<i>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

824
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:46,634
<i>You couldn't hurt a fly</i>

825
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:48,063
<i>You're scared so stiff</i>

826
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:51,297
<i>You look like you've been stuffed</i>

827
00:54:51,572 --> 00:54:53,540
<i>Well, speakin' of who's stuffed</i>

828
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:55,573
<i>That paunch is pretty puffed</i>

829
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,245
<i>It's clear that you've been Hvin' loud</i>

830
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:02,680
<i>- What's clear, my dear, is I'm in charge
- Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

831
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:05,146
<i>It's time to give up the crown</i>

832
00:55:05,353 --> 00:55:09,449
<i>There's only room for one top cat in town</i>

833
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:11,757
<i>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

834
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:14,155
<i>Let's kiss this cat goodbye</i>

835
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:18,591
<i>You keep your pretty paws off my domain</i>

836
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,868
<i>- You lily-Iivered lump</i>

837
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:23,127
<i>Your own shadow makes you jump</i>

838
00:55:23,438 --> 00:55:25,805
<i>Your roar is more a widow's yelp</i>

839
00:55:25,973 --> 00:55:28,067
<i>Oh, when I roar, you'll need some help
Ow.</i>

840
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,436
<i>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

841
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:32,340
<i>You better be back in town</i>

842
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,445
<i>There's only room for one top cat in town</i>

843
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:41,380
<i>Oh, spare me
So, you think that'll scare me?</i>

844
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:44,956
<i>I'll prove that
when it comes to being fearless</i>

845
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:46,251
<i>I'm peerless</i>

846
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:50,464
<i>Oh, spare me
Are you trying to dare me?</i>

847
00:55:50,732 --> 00:55:52,826
<i>Your Muster doesn't fluster</i>

848
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:55,365
<i>'Cause you know that the top cats</i>

849
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:57,766
<i>Are lions</i>

850
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,101
<i>They're tigers</i>

851
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:03,106
<i>They're bears</i>

852
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:04,801
What?

853
00:56:04,979 --> 00:56:06,708
<i>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

854
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:09,009
<i>Now who's this grizzly guy?</i>

855
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:13,379
<i>- The forest is for felines to control
- Oof!</i>

856
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:15,923
<i>It's only you and me</i>

857
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,954
<i>So, who's it gonna be?</i>

858
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,427
<i>Who says it can't be shareable?</i>

859
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:22,753
<i>- Does that sound so unbearable?</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

860
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:25,125
<i>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

861
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,461
<i>Well, I ain't backin' down</i>

862
00:56:27,668 --> 00:56:29,659
<i>There's only room for one top cat</i>

863
00:56:29,837 --> 00:56:31,931
- The Tiger Queen!
- Imagine that.

864
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:34,904
<i>There's only room for one top cat</i>

865
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:38,236
<i>In town!</i>

866
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:44,509
<i>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my</i>

867
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:46,343
Mmm?

868
00:56:57,298 --> 00:57:00,359
At last, behold the dazzling beauty!

869
00:57:01,102 --> 00:57:02,592
Flattery will get you nowhere.

870
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:07,206
Ha! I wasn't talking about you, girly.
I was talking about the ruby slippers.

871
00:57:08,743 --> 00:57:09,869
Give them here.

872
00:57:10,278 --> 00:57:11,973
- Oh, you mustn't.
- Oh, don't worry.

873
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,272
I won't.

874
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:18,685
Hmm. Well, if I take the slippers
by force, their magic will be diminished.

875
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:21,478
But perhaps you'll surrender them

876
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,817
- to save your friends.
- Oh.

877
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:26,184
Rip the Scarecrow to bits.

878
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,052
Oh, hold on. Wait a second!

879
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:30,387
- Mash up that Munchkin Mouse.
- No!

880
00:57:31,766 --> 00:57:33,461
Then give me the slippers.

881
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:35,496
Don't do it, Dorothy!

882
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:38,567
No!

883
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,772
I won't have you hurt because of me.

884
00:57:41,075 --> 00:57:42,338
Don't do it, Dorothy!

885
00:57:48,115 --> 00:57:50,311
Here. I'm sure you'll look lovely in them.

886
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:52,542
Ah.

887
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:56,089
You really don't understand
their power, do you?

888
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:00,625
These miraculous shoes reflect
the personality of whoever wears them.

889
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:03,058
To you, they're ruby slippers.

890
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:07,528
To me, they're blood-red boots.

891
00:58:13,107 --> 00:58:14,165
Beware, Ruggedo!

892
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:16,811
Those who use the Rubies for evil
only come to misfortune.

893
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:18,103
Ooh, ooh.

894
00:58:18,346 --> 00:58:20,974
I'll keep a lookout for falling houses.

895
00:58:21,182 --> 00:58:24,277
Besides, I'm not evil.
I'm just taking back what's mine.

896
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:26,476
Starting with this city.

897
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:28,745
What? Well, what about all the people?

898
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:32,617
They're welcome to come below
as my slaves.

899
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:35,524
In fact, I insist on it.

900
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,061
No, you can't!

901
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,990
- You don't like it?
- No, no, no!

902
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,494
Then you're excused.

903
00:58:40,735 --> 00:58:42,430
Short stuff!

904
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:47,568
We're almost there.

905
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,537
And I'm almost back to normal.

906
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:56,344
It was nice while it lasted.

907
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:58,546
- Tuffy!
- My queen!

908
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,776
Jerry!

909
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,356
The Nome King has the ruby slippers.

910
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:06,653
And he'll use their magic
to sink the Emerald City beneath Oz.

911
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:09,057
How horrible! We must get inside quickly.

912
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,220
I have an idea.

913
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:13,025
Remember that Cyclonotron thing
back at your farm?

914
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:15,898
Well, I think we can improve
on its design.

915
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:17,195
I've got the parts.

916
00:59:17,438 --> 00:59:19,600
Now, if we can get tools and mousepower...

917
00:59:20,608 --> 00:59:21,632
Oh, great.

918
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:24,901
Now, let's put that arm over there.
And attach that leg here.

919
00:59:25,179 --> 00:59:26,578
And the other leg,
I'd like to put right here.

920
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,679
And my head exactly right there.

921
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:31,882
Whoa, Ziggy!

922
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:39,850
Now, at last, the emeralds of Emerald City
will be back where they belong.

923
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:43,696
Oh, I got a sinkin' feelin' about this.

924
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:46,361
There's no place like Nome.

925
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:49,366
<i>There's no place like Nome!</i>

926
00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:52,469
<i>There's no place like Nome!</i>

927
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:55,238
<i>Going down!</i>

928
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,381
Oh, no! The city is sinking!

929
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:04,842
Step on it, Jerry!

930
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:13,249
<i>It was not so long ago</i>

931
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:16,263
<i>That I saw you as a foe</i>

932
01:00:16,497 --> 01:00:20,627
<i>Who might have been a hiccup in my plan</i>

933
01:00:20,968 --> 01:00:23,665
<i>But look, you're fragile as a flower</i>

934
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:25,929
<i>Now you don't have any power</i>

935
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,104
<i>So, I'll destroy you just because I can</i>

936
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:35,239
<i>Oh, I'll come to the new Emerald City</i>

937
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:40,348
<i>Let the bells of doom start to ring</i>

938
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:42,855
<i>For you can never stop</i>

939
01:00:43,024 --> 01:00:46,551
<i>The destruction I will bring</i>

940
01:00:46,794 --> 01:00:49,422
<i>What's mine is mine</i>

941
01:00:49,597 --> 01:00:51,656
<i>What's his is his</i>

942
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:55,664
<i>Because I am the King</i>

943
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,202
<i>Because he is the King</i>

944
01:00:58,372 --> 01:01:04,311
<i>Because he is the King
King, King, King, King, King, King</i>

945
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,569
<i>King</i>

946
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:13,077
Where are we?

947
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:16,422
Ah, Nome sweet Nome.

948
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:20,923
I know how disappointed you must be
to not stop the big bad Nome King.

949
01:01:21,128 --> 01:01:23,620
<i>Boo-hoe. Sniff, sniff it all...</i>

950
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:26,126
<i>Ah, cue the sad music.</i>

951
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:29,728
Oh, cheer up.
I have a big job for a little lady.

952
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,665
<i>And I hope you're up to the task</i>

953
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:35,240
<i>because you're going to spend
the rest of your life digging up jewels</i>

954
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,974
for me.

955
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:39,145
Oh, really? And if I refuse?

956
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:45,076
Then it's into the Pit of Nome Return.

957
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:50,121
See, I call it that,
as no nome has ever returned from it.

958
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,718
Hmm, matter of fact,

959
01:01:52,927 --> 01:01:54,292
the longer I keep you two around,

960
01:01:54,495 --> 01:01:56,793
the more I'm convinced
you'll stir up trouble.

961
01:01:57,898 --> 01:01:59,696
Toss them in.

962
01:02:02,203 --> 01:02:03,295
Well?

963
01:02:03,938 --> 01:02:06,464
We're fine with causing general mayhem,

964
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:09,540
as outlined in
the Nome Guard job description.

965
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:12,212
But when it actually
comes down to destroying

966
01:02:12,379 --> 01:02:14,814
living scarecrows and little girls,

967
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:16,608
we're drawing the line.

968
01:02:18,586 --> 01:02:20,145
You are fired.

969
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:30,328
He really doesn't mince words, does he?

970
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:32,594
- Come on!
- Seize them!

971
01:02:34,902 --> 01:02:36,563
Time to pull this all together.

972
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:39,829
Good job.

973
01:02:40,574 --> 01:02:41,564
Jerry...

974
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:49,474
You're canned, Nome King.

975
01:02:49,817 --> 01:02:52,184
You would need an army to stop me.

976
01:02:52,453 --> 01:02:53,545
They've got one.

977
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:56,813
Come on, men. Let's go!

978
01:02:57,658 --> 01:02:59,217
You'll have to do better than that.

979
01:03:03,764 --> 01:03:04,754
Huh?

980
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:18,701
Oh! Toto! Tom!

981
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,241
- Lion!
- Lion?

982
01:03:20,414 --> 01:03:21,540
Alive and in person,

983
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:24,446
accompanied by Tom the Terrible,
and Toto the Terrific,

984
01:03:24,652 --> 01:03:26,051
masters of the animal kingdom.

985
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,688
I'd like to thank all the little people

986
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:29,720
who made our appearance
down here possible.

987
01:03:29,924 --> 01:03:31,551
The moles, the gophers,

988
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,524
especially the badgers,
great digging, fellas.

989
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,025
And don't forget me.

990
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:39,494
Old fraidy cat promised me
all the nomes I could eat.

991
01:03:39,767 --> 01:03:40,962
Ooh la la.

992
01:03:42,269 --> 01:03:43,759
What's your hurry, delicious?

993
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:47,932
- Oh! Food to go!
- Food to go! Love it!

994
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,435
It'll take more than
some mangy mammals to scare me.

995
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:52,936
Right you are.

996
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,241
We nearly forgot the air force.

997
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:07,153
Eggs! Nomes hate eggs!

998
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,491
Eggs! Eggs!

999
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:12,596
Come back, you cowards!

1000
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,492
Come back! All right, then go.

1001
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,635
I have all the power I need.

1002
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:31,908
Ha ha!

1003
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:41,084
<i>Hey, there, Kansas,
what's a-shaking?</i>

1004
01:04:41,262 --> 01:04:43,560
- Jitterbug.
<i>- What's with the crazy, queasy quaking?</i>

1005
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:45,025
We need your help.

1006
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:46,564
Sure thing, my country cutie.

1007
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:48,963
I'm yours to command, all right-o-rooty.

1008
01:04:56,744 --> 01:04:58,439
Come and get me, you beasts.

1009
01:04:58,646 --> 01:04:59,807
The bigger the better.

1010
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:04,948
Uh-oh!

1011
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:06,542
Ha ha!

1012
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:16,089
You don't think anyone
can stand up to you?

1013
01:05:16,797 --> 01:05:18,390
Ha! Like you?

1014
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:19,998
Well, yes! Like me!

1015
01:05:20,467 --> 01:05:22,231
- Like all of us.
- Yeah.

1016
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,336
Three losers?

1017
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,839
A scruffy dog, and a cat, and a mouse.

1018
01:05:29,076 --> 01:05:30,066
That's nothing.

1019
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:32,746
Well, they're my friends.
And that's everything.

1020
01:05:33,213 --> 01:05:37,081
Friends? You gave up
the only magic you'll ever have

1021
01:05:37,284 --> 01:05:38,376
for them!

1022
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:43,079
Dorothy girl, you are a fool!

1023
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:55,966
Oh! Hold on!

1024
01:05:57,638 --> 01:05:58,867
I'm ripping!

1025
01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:00,631
That's terrible!

1026
01:06:01,675 --> 01:06:04,007
Talk about grasping at straws.

1027
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:07,472
- Ruggedo, let them go.
- Of course.

1028
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,543
No reason they should
hang around any longer.

1029
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,576
Isn't that right, Scarecrow?

1030
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:13,776
<i>I'm slipping.</i>

1031
01:06:14,188 --> 01:06:16,850
<i>Any last words, little girl?</i>

1032
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:21,588
Let's dance!

1033
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:30,064
<i>Let's swing those funky, filthy feet</i>

1034
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,332
What? Stop, stop! Whoa!

1035
01:06:33,974 --> 01:06:36,409
Curse of Jitterbug!

1036
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:52,615
Whoa!

1037
01:06:57,731 --> 01:06:59,290
Swing it king, now buck and wing.

1038
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,366
Now wrestle those pants
with a Russian dance.

1039
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:04,668
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can't do this to me!

1040
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:08,165
You're right, Kingy.
Dancing alone ain't all that merry.

1041
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:10,606
You need partners, Tom and Jerry.

1042
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:37,597
- Miss Glinda.
- Your Highness, my eternal thanks.

1043
01:07:38,005 --> 01:07:39,336
You, too, Tuffy.

1044
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:49,972
Tom!

1045
01:07:53,554 --> 01:07:56,785
Help me! Help!

1046
01:07:58,192 --> 01:07:59,353
Pull me back!

1047
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,892
I said pull, you fools!

1048
01:08:12,906 --> 01:08:15,102
Pull, you fool.

1049
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:18,141
Come on, come on, pull harder, harder!

1050
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:24,051
Well, that was just awful.

1051
01:08:24,384 --> 01:08:25,874
But at least he went dancing.

1052
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:33,456
Hey, Kansas,
don't forget the boots, cutes.

1053
01:08:41,068 --> 01:08:44,003
If their magic was strong
enough to sink the Emerald City...

1054
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:46,262
Then what was done can be undone.

1055
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:47,634
If you wish.

1056
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:50,475
I wish...

1057
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:11,826
- You did it, Dorothy.
- We knew you could.

1058
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:13,897
Mmm-hmm.

1059
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:15,766
Talk about your elevator shoes.

1060
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,933
And look who slept through
the whole thing.

1061
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:27,878
Hurry, Butch, while she's asleep.

1062
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,246
I'm lucky, she swallowed me in one gulp.

1063
01:09:36,857 --> 01:09:39,019
Me, not so much.

1064
01:09:42,896 --> 01:09:45,160
- Halt, miscreants!
- Wizard!

1065
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,793
Why, we thought you was a goner.

1066
01:09:48,035 --> 01:09:49,628
How did you drive away the monkeys?

1067
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,968
Drive away? No, no, no.

1068
01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:53,639
I tamed them. Yes.

1069
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:57,878
I remembered I had an assortment
of frutis gigantica seeds.

1070
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:01,672
I simply tossed some seeds
from the bottled labeled "Bananas,"

1071
01:10:02,382 --> 01:10:06,319
and presto, they were literally
eating out of my hand.

1072
01:10:07,421 --> 01:10:09,913
You couldn't have returned
in a more auspicious moment.

1073
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,585
Yes.

1074
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:16,386
To capture the scoundrels
responsible for this catastrophe.

1075
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:20,760
Please, Your Wizardship.

1076
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,993
We were only following orders.

1077
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:26,333
And we were fired
before succumbing to true villainy.

1078
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,077
In that case, I think
a wizardly pardon can be arranged.

1079
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:34,245
And perhaps a change of occupation.

1080
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:40,086
Well, isn't this a horse
of a different color?

1081
01:10:41,722 --> 01:10:43,417
Only on the outside.

1082
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,331
While I thank you
for this wonderful welcome,

1083
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:54,898
I want to assure you

1084
01:10:55,135 --> 01:10:58,435
that the Scarecrow, Lion, and Tin Man

1085
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:01,869
shall continue as
ruling triumvirate of Oz.

1086
01:11:03,977 --> 01:11:06,503
Well, I humbly accept
the tenured position

1087
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,112
of Wizard <i>emeritus indilectus.</i>

1088
01:11:09,383 --> 01:11:10,976
Uh, with pay.

1089
01:11:11,284 --> 01:11:12,410
But once again,

1090
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:17,484
the real heroes
are Dorothy and her friends from Kansas.

1091
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,127
Yes, and remember, my dear,

1092
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,928
though some may call you a child,

1093
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,866
Your brave spirit is ageless.

1094
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:36,007
Thank you, sir.

1095
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:39,645
Um, Jerry, I think somebody else
wants to say goodbye.

1096
01:11:39,946 --> 01:11:43,712
And I still owe you my thanks
for your heroism, Mr. Jerry.

1097
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:54,054
You're one of us now.

1098
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:56,661
A fearless fellow feline forever.

1099
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:59,457
Lions, and tigers,
and cats, oh, yeah!

1100
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:04,097
Glinda, the ruby slippers...

1101
01:12:04,438 --> 01:12:06,532
Well, they don't belong to me.

1102
01:12:06,773 --> 01:12:10,232
Oh, my dear, you think
they might be better off here in Oz.

1103
01:12:10,544 --> 01:12:12,171
But because of your heroic deeds,

1104
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:14,673
you've won the right to keep them forever.

1105
01:12:15,115 --> 01:12:17,709
Besides, you'll need them to visit us.

1106
01:12:18,685 --> 01:12:22,178
- Often, we hope.
- Oh, I will. I promise.

1107
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:25,082
There's just one more thing
I'd like to take with me.

1108
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:27,019
Name it, my dear.

1109
01:12:37,337 --> 01:12:39,499
Well, here we go again, I guess.

1110
01:12:39,973 --> 01:12:41,566
Goodbye, everyone.

1111
01:12:41,742 --> 01:12:43,767
So long, Kansas.

1112
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:45,774
I'll see you, kiddo.

1113
01:12:46,146 --> 01:12:47,375
Safe journeys.

1114
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:49,140
Hurry back, Dorothy.

1115
01:12:51,485 --> 01:12:55,217
There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

1116
01:12:55,388 --> 01:12:57,152
There's no place like home.

1117
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:01,419
Take this.

1118
01:13:02,195 --> 01:13:04,687
Mr. Bibb will be here any second.

1119
01:13:12,839 --> 01:13:15,831
- Good morning, Mr. Bibb.
- What's good about it?

1120
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:19,977
Last night, my barbecue stand
was wrecked by two furry hooligans.

1121
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:24,208
Two furry hooligans just about your size.

1122
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:28,350
Uh, Mr. Bibb, if we could replace
your melon crop,

1123
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:30,647
would you take it in return
for our animals?

1124
01:13:31,024 --> 01:13:34,426
Child, I'd sign off
on this court order right now.

1125
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,392
Except I know
you all don't raise watermelons.

1126
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,492
Well, we only needed to raise one.

1127
01:13:42,769 --> 01:13:46,399
It's amazing!
It's unbelievable.

1128
01:13:47,107 --> 01:13:48,802
And it's all yours.

1129
01:13:58,118 --> 01:14:00,746
<i>You boys better be careful with that.</i>

1130
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:17,500
<i>This is the pits.</i>

1131
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,502
This is ironic!

1132
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,310
Poor Mr. Bibb.

1133
01:14:28,648 --> 01:14:29,979
<i>Oh, don't fret none.</i>

1134
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,342
That ornery little butterball
needs the exercise.

1135
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,146
Tractor?

1136
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,049
Thank goodness you made it home!

1137
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,883
It'll take more than a little windstorm

1138
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:42,117
to keep this old heap away from her farm.
Oh!

1139
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:45,196
Nighty night, missy.

1140
01:14:45,932 --> 01:14:47,093
Goodness!

1141
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:49,666
So, who's gonna clean up this mess?

1142
01:14:58,211 --> 01:15:00,839
Auntie Em, Uncle Henry,
wait 'til you hear!

1143
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,945
Not now, Dorothy. We've got bad news.

1144
01:15:04,117 --> 01:15:06,779
We couldn't get the loan,
and no one was hiring.

1145
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,887
So, we're gonna have to
hand over all the animals to Mr. Bibb.

1146
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:12,655
But he was just here and he gave me this.

1147
01:15:13,827 --> 01:15:16,455
Ha! Appears Bibb is dropping the suit.

1148
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,026
I sort of talked him into it.

1149
01:15:19,499 --> 01:15:20,625
You did this?

1150
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:24,460
Hmm. Em, looks like
our little girl is all grown up.

1151
01:15:24,871 --> 01:15:26,339
Hurray for Dorothy!

1152
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,507
Hurray for Dorothy.

1153
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:32,640
And now, we can really rebuild our farm.

1154
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:50,789
Quickly, too, before those boys
wreck it any worse.

1155
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:02,602
Some things never change around here.

1156
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:04,842
Oh, and I hope they never will.

1157
01:16:05,378 --> 01:16:06,868
And that we're together forever.

1158
01:16:07,414 --> 01:16:08,973
It's like I always say, Auntie Em...

1159
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:15,085
<i>And when I'm singing
to the Kansas sky</i>

1160
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:19,589
<i>I know why I don't roam</i>

1161
01:16:20,026 --> 01:16:24,725
<i>'Cause it slaps a smile
right across my face</i>

1162
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:30,228
<i>There's no place like home</i>

1163
