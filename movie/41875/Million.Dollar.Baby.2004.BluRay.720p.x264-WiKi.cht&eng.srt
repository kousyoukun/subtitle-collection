1
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,170
百萬  美元  寶貝

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,360
加油
Do it!

3
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,870
你能打敗他！你能打敗他！
You got him! You got him!

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,290
我只遇見過一個我不想和他爭斗的人
I only ever met one man I wouldn't wanna fight.

5
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,060
我止不了血
I can't stop that.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,030
滾開吧，你個沒有的東西
Get out of here, you useless tit.

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,170
我遇見他的時候 他已經是拳擊界最好的傷口護理師
When I met him, he was already the best cut man in the business.

8
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,570
你能止住嗎？
Can you stop it?

9
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,070
從60年代起就開始做訓練師和經理人 一直保持著高昂的熱情
Started training and managing in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,830
不行
No.

11
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,280
我來看看他
Let me have a look at him.

12
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,110
他沒事，他沒事
He's fine. He's fine.

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,580
如果你止不了血的話就不是沒事
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
我再給你一個回合
I'll give you one more round.

15
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,430
- 時間到了，來吧    - 我們怎么辦？告訴我怎么辦
- Seconds out. Let's go.    - What do we do? Tell me what to do.

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,630
你讓他打你
You let him hit you.

17
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,870
有時你就是無能為力
Sometimes there's just nothing you can do.

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,200
傷口太深, 離骨頭太近
Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.

19
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,970
也許是斷了一條血管...
Maybe you got a severed vein...

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,880
...或者你就是無法讓止血藥深入里面
...or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.

21
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,490
- 加油！    - 分開，分開
- Come on!    - Break. Break.

22
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,320
在肌肉的不同層次
There are all kinds of combinations you come up against...

23
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,720
你會遇到各種不同的問題組合
...down in the different layers of meat...

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,790
而弗蘭基全都知道如何解決
...and Frankie knew how to work every one.

25
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,600
- 對！加油！    - 你在做什么？
- That's it! Come on!    - What are you doing?

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,000
打倒他，威利！
Knock him out, Willie!

27
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,450
人們熱愛暴力
People love violence.

28
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,020
他們會在車禍現場 減慢車速查看死尸
They'll slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies.

29
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,460
就是這些人宣稱他們熱愛拳擊
Same people claim to love boxing.

30
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,960
他們根本不了解拳擊是什么
They got no idea what it is.

31
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,620
拳擊是有關尊嚴
Boxing is about respect.

32
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,630
贏得你自己的...
Getting it for yourself...

33
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,140
...同時剝奪對手的
...and taking it away from the other guy.

34
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,510
我先去發動車
I'll warm up the car.

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,110
鄧先生？
Mr.Dunn?

36
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,280
我欠你錢？
I owe you money?

37
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,710
沒有，先生
No, sir.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,370
我認識你媽媽？
I know your mama?

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,680
這個我確實不知道，先生
Don't rightly know, sir.

40
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,320
- 那你想干什么？    - 我參加了墊場賽
- Then what is it you want?    - I was on the undercard.

41
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,080
而且我也贏了 我是麥琪 菲斯杰拉德
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,820
那么，麥琪 菲斯杰拉德，有什么事嗎？
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

43
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,350
- 你有沒有正好看了我的比賽？    - 沒有
- Did you happen to see it?    - Nope.

44
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,960
我干的不錯
I did pretty good.

45
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,620
我想你也許有興趣訓練我
Thought you might be interested in training me.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,530
我不訓練女孩子
I don't train girls.

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,160
也許你應該試試 看我打過的人都說我很兇狠
Maybe you should. People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,210
小姐, 光是兇狠并不夠
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

49
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,230
這是個錯誤
It's a mistake.

50
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,560
車應該能向后退的，弗蘭基
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

51
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,230
幫我推一下，行不？
Just push, will you?

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,030
- 霍根有什么事？    - 邀請我們參加頭銜戰
- What did Hogan want?    - Offered us a title shot.

53
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,070
是時候了
About time.

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,210
我直接把他拒絕了
I turned him down flat.

55
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,810
再多打兩三場比賽 你就準備充分了
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

56
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,280
好久以前就說是兩三場比賽了，弗蘭基
Been two or three more fights for a long time now, Frankie.

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,850
聽著，威利 你只有一次機會贏得冠軍
Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.

58
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,020
輸掉的話 可能就再沒有機會了
You lose it, it may not come around again.

59
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,030
再多打兩三場比賽 我們就準備充分了
Now, two or three more fights and we'll be ready.

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,860
都聽你的，弗蘭基
Whatever you say, Frankie.

61
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,860
弗蘭基總喜歡說 拳擊是一種不自然的運動
Frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act...

62
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,140
因為拳擊中的每樣東西都是逆向的
...that everything in boxing is backwards.

63
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,370
有時...
Sometimes...

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,280
...打出一記重拳 的最好方法是退后一步
...best way to deliver a punch is step back.

65
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,720
我的主啊，請盡力...
Well, do your best, Lord...

66
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,090
...保護凱蒂
...protect Katy.

67
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,760
還有安妮
Annie too.

68
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,220
至于其他的...
Other than that...

69
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,370
...你知道我想要什么 所以我再重復也沒有什么用
...you know what I want, there's no use me repeating myself.

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
但是退后太多 你就已經退出比賽了
But step back too far, you ain't fighting at all.

71
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,260
（圣馬可教堂）

72
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,990
- 再見    - 再見
- Bye.    - Bye.

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,790
神父，布道很精彩，讓我流淚
Father, that was a great sermon. Made me weep.

74
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,430
你這周又有什么疑惑？
What's confusing you this week?

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,070
噢，就是那個老掉牙的三位一體的問題
Oh, it's the same old one-God-three-God thing.

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,470
弗蘭基, 大多數人幼兒園的時候 就知道一切都是信心的問題
Frankie, most people figure out by kindergarten it's about faith.

77
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,130
是不是有點象三種不一樣的薩其馬 都裝在一個大盒子里？
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop all rolled up in one big box?

78
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,510
你站在我的教堂外面 把上帝比做點心？
You're standing outside my church comparing God to Rice Krispies?

79
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,450
你來做彌撒的唯一原因 就是要騷擾我
The only reason you come to Mass is to wind me up.

80
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,680
- 不過今天不會了    - 我有點迷惑
- It won't happen this morning.    - I'm confused.

81
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,150
- 不，你沒有    - 不，我有
- No, you aren't.    - Yes, I am.

82
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,520
那好，我給你的答案是： 只有一位上帝
Then here's your answer: There's one God.

83
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,160
還有事嗎？我很忙
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

84
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,160
- 那么圣靈呢？    - 他是上帝的愛的一種表現形式
- What about the Holy Ghost?    - He's an expression of God's love.

85
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,920
- 耶穌呢？    - 上帝之子，別在這兒裝傻了
- And Jesus?    - Son of God. Don't play stupid.

86
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,470
那么他是什么呢？ 上帝的兒子意味著半神半人？
What is he then? Does that make him a demigod?

87
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,000
沒有半神半人 操他媽的異教徒！
There are no demigods, you fucking pagan!

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,350
- 給你女兒寫信了么？    - 當然
- Did you write your daughter?    - Absolutely.

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,070
你這是對一個神父撒謊
Now you're lying to a priest.

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,810
跟你說吧，休息一天 明天別來了
You know what? Take a day off, don't come to Mass tomorrow.

91
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,480
（斗場拳擊館）

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,360
有些人會說對于一個拳手來說 最重要的莫過于熱情
Some people would say the most important thing a fighter can have is heart.

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,370
弗蘭基則會說 “給我一個只有熱情的拳手...
Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart...

94
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,700
...我會告訴他什么叫鼻青臉腫”
...and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating."

95
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,480
我想我只見過一個全心投入的拳手
Think I only ever met one fighter who was all heart.

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,350
我的名號是“戰斗小子” 丹吉爾 迪拉德 巴奇...
My name's Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,390
...來自德克薩斯布勞德縣！
...out of Broward County, T exas!

98
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,960
丹吉爾是幾年前來的
Danger showed up a couple of years back.

99
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,830
他和他媽媽的新男友艾瑞威爾 一起到洛杉磯來
He'd come visiting L.A. With Ervel, his mama's new boyfriend.

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,270
似乎艾瑞威爾迷了路 自己回去了德克薩斯
Apparently Ervel got lost and ended up back in Texas.

101
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,040
在來這里以前 丹吉爾找了他大概一個星期
Danger looked for him for about a week before he introduced himself.

102
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,950
嘿，你知道么 我對黑鬼從來沒有任何偏見
Hey, you know, I gots nothing against niggers.

103
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,390
呃，真高興聽你這么說
Well, that's nice to hear.

104
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,810
嗯，我的家鄉很多人確實是那樣...
Yeah, lots of people where I comes from does...

105
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,570
...但是我媽媽告訴我 不要傷害任何人...
...but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man...

106
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,470
...不管是不是黑鬼
...niggers or not.

107
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,230
你媽媽還真是個好人 我可以幫你點什么嘛？
You got a nice mama. Anything else I can do for you?

108
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,660
你也許只是隨便問個問題  ...
Just one of those questions you ask...

109
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,990
...但是丹吉爾總想給你最好的答案
...but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.

110
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,570
我想成為次中量級世界冠軍
Well, sir, I'd likes to become the welterweight champion of the world.

111
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,340
我要挑戰“城市機動眼鏡蛇”...
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

112
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,200
...還有“刺客”湯馬斯 赫爾斯...
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

113
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,460
...爭奪次中量級世界冠軍！
...to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world!

114
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,690
冒失鬼，閉嘴 你連排名都沒有
Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.

115
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,240
你最少要打一場比賽才能有排名
You gotta have at least one fight to be ranked.

116
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,010
嘿，我可以和任何人打，隨時！
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

117
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,840
嘿，你是個壞蛋，是嗎？
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

118
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,460
進繩圈里來，我陪你玩一回合
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

119
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,370
- 謝瑞爾    - 沒問題
- Shawrelle.    - I will.

120
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,910
別理他
Leave him alone.

121
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,370
丹吉爾, 你繼續訓練
Danger, you go on back to training.

122
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,240
我會的，斯科雷普先生
Will do, Mr.Scrap.

123
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,820
你的緊身褲不錯
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

124
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,600
我以后再揍你的屁股 小妞
I'll give you that ass-whupping later, Olive Oyl.

125
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
你的褲子還真不賴，丹吉爾
Hey, bro, those pants look real pretty on you.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,830
把他媽媽的緊身衣還給她吧
Give his mama back her tights.

127
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,020
謝瑞爾 貝里的左鉤拳 可以打飛一輛坦克 ...
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook that would move a tank...

128
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,250
...但是他的心胸卻象豆子一樣小
...but he had a heart the size of a split pea.

129
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,380
弗蘭基17年前從巴比 馬龍 手里買下了斗場拳擊館
Frankie bought the Hit Pit from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.

130
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,170
巴比想搬到佛羅里達去 而弗蘭基想要生活有點保障
Bobby wanted to move to Florida, and Frankie wanted some security.

131
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,130
巴比在他收拾行李的時候死掉了
Bobby died while he was packing.

132
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,160
弗蘭基那時候才發現 大多數拳擊館都虧錢
And Frankie found out most gyms lose money.

133
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,380
我想我已經告訴過你 別讓丹吉爾繼續訓練下去了
I thought I told you I didn't want Danger working out here anymore.

134
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,610
他又不會傷害到別人，弗蘭基
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

135
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,170
他傷害到我了
Well, he's hurting me.

136
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,060
我看著心疼 看他朝著空氣揮拳，好象空氣會反擊一樣
Breaking my heart, watching him punch the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

137
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,160
還有我告訴你多少次了 漂白液就是漂白液
And how many times have I gotta tell you that bleach is bleach?

138
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,920
你就不能買便宜點的么？ 不用買貴的那種
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff? You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,120
這種更好聞一些，弗蘭基
It smells better, Frankie.

140
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,270
漂白液聞起來還是漂白液
Bleach smells like bleach.

141
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,490
- 嘿，斯科雷普    - 嘿，威利先生
- Hey, Scrap.    - Hey, Mr.Willie.

142
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,780
嘿，昨晚打得不錯
Hey, nice fight last night.

143
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,900
打得不錯
Nice fight.

144
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,890
- 大個子威利    - 嘿，賽利
- Big Willie.    - Hey, Sally.

145
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,930
- 打得不錯    - 謝了，兄弟
- Nice fight.    - Thanks, man.

146
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,500
有人在談話
People are talking.

147
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,770
這他媽的是什么語言？
What the hell kind of language is that?

148
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,640
你想干嗎？
What do you want?

149
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,810
我想你可能想知道 你有一個拳手...
I thought you might like to know you got a fighter out there...

150
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,460
...不跟別的經理人說話
...not talking to another manager.

151
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,270
不跟別的經理人說話？
Not talking to another manager?

152
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,830
不是隨便什么經理人
And not just any manager.

153
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,600
米奇 麥克
Mickey Mack.

154
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,060
你進來就是為了跟我說大個子威利 不跟米奇 麥克說話
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

155
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,350
他們兩個人，一個字都沒說
Not a word. Neither one of them.

156
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,830
我正打算讀書
I'm trying to read here.

157
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,020
好吧，如果你覺得讀書更重要
Well, if you think that's more important.

158
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,830
新來的那個女孩是誰？
Who's your new girl?

159
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,760
什么？
What?

160
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,620
我的老天
Jesus Christ.

161
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,130
最好快點
Better hurry up.

162
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,840
她要繼續這么打沙袋 手腕遲早會斷
She keeps hitting it like that, she gonna break her wrists.

163
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,370
你在浪費時間 我告訴過你我不訓練女人
You're wasting your time. I told you I don't train girls.

164
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,610
我想你也許會改變主意
Thought you might change your mind.

165
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,380
外面有至少一打訓練師訓練女人 找到一個很容易
Dozens of trainers train girls. You won't have any trouble finding one.

166
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,050
我不需要一打，老板 您一個就會很好
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

167
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,840
別叫我老板，我不是你老板 你別再這么叫了
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss, and don't you be calling me that.

168
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,400
- 威利，你準備好了么？    - 隨時可以開始
- Willie, you ready to work?    - Anytime.

169
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,470
如果我不叫你老板 你會訓練我么？
If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?

170
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,160
不會
No.

171
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,880
那我還是繼續這樣叫您好了
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,570
她從密蘇里州西南部來...
She came from southwestern Missouri...

173
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,010
...歐扎克地區的小城鎮 西奧多西亞城外的山上...
...the hills outside the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia...

174
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,030
...一個雪松和橡樹環繞 比偏僻更偏僻的地方
...set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

175
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,930
在成長的過程中她只知道一件事： 自己是個垃圾
She grew up knowing one thing: She was trash.

176
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,710
是給我的狗的
It's for my dog.

177
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,940
盡管她可以跋涉1800英里 西奧多西亞還是就在那山上
She'd come 1800 miles, but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

178
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,140
我在打沙袋，老板
Working the bag, boss.

179
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,040
我不是你的老板 還有，是沙袋在打你
I'm not your boss. And that bag's working you.

180
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,020
把錢退給她
Give her her money back.

181
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,610
你確定？
You sure?

182
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,790
- 她付了多少錢？    - 六個月的
- How much did she pay?    - Six months.

183
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,820
- 我的老天    - 我去還給她
- Jesus Christ.    - No, I'll give it back.

184
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,430
不，別裝聰明了，好嗎？
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

185
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,230
這女人一定會覺得咱們為了趕她走...
Woman thinks I'll throw away six months' worth of dues...

186
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,640
...連六個月的費用都不要 她肯定會發瘋的
...just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

187
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,750
- 但是千萬別鼓勵她，明白了么？    - 好
- But just don't encourage her, understand?    - Okay.

188
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,910
丹吉爾在外面做什么？ 他在看什么？
And what's Danger doing out there? What's he looking at?

189
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,650
好象是一瓶水
Looks like a bottle of water.

190
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,120
他付費了么？
He paid his dues?

191
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,800
費用？ 他連褲子都買不起，你想讓他付訓練費？
Dues? Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?

192
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,900
出去吧
Get out of my office.

193
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,870
我操
Fuck me.

194
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,560
你不能把它當做沙袋
Can't think of it as a bag.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,900
我雖然不是訓練師 但是如果你愿意的話我可以示范一下
I'm not a trainer, but I can show you this if you'd like.

196
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,530
任何幫助我都會感激您
Appreciate any help I can get.

197
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,660
你要做的是 你要把它看成是一個人，明白嗎？
What you wanna do is, you wanna think of it as a man, see?

198
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,130
他在不停地移動
And he's constantly moving.

199
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,780
沖著你，繞著你 遠離你，明白嗎？
He's moving towards you, around you, away from you. All right?

200
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,490
不要在他向你移動的時候擊打他 因為他會把你向后推...
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you because he's just gonna push you back...

201
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,990
...化解你的擊打 讓你失去平衡，對嗎？
...he's gonna smother your punches and take your balance, right?

202
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,010
所以你要小心的注視他
So you watch him real carefully.

203
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,490
不停轉動 這樣你的頭就一直在動
Keep rotating. That keeps your head moving.

204
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,390
一個肩膀放在后側 這樣你隨時可以打出一記重拳
And keep one shoulder back so you're always ready to fire a power shot.

205
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,330
對嗎？來，好，好 不停旋轉，不停移動，好
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good. Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

206
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,700
好，下巴收住
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

207
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,780
繼續 不停移動，不停移動
Come on around. Keep moving, keep moving.

208
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,610
- 好，好，好    - 象這樣？
- Good, good, good.    - Like that?

209
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,210
對，給它幾下
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

210
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,810
下巴收住 下巴收住
Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.

211
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,790
非常好，很好
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

212
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,750
等練完這個 我們就安排你打梨球
Now, you get this down, we'll put you on the speed bag.

213
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,730
你有梨球吧
You do have a speed bag.

214
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,370
我有錢買自己的之前先借用一下
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

215
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,140
好，那你回家吧
All right, you go on home now.

216
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,180
- 我和你一起出去？    - 不用，這里就是我家
- I'll walk out with you?    - No, I am home.

217
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,550
- 想看看嗎？    - 嗯
- Wanna see?    - Yeah.

218
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,830
挺好的
It's nice.

219
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,860
我再打一會兒會不會打擾您？
Would it bother you if I worked a little longer?

220
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,390
不會，走的時候把門關好就行了
No, just pull the door closed when you leave.

221
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,410
謝謝
Thank you.

222
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,280
如果拳擊運動中有訣竅的話...
If there's magic in boxing...

223
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,090
...那么這種訣竅就是不停戰斗 超越耐力的極限...
...it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance...

224
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,560
...超越折斷的肋骨 破裂的腎臟，和脫落的視網膜
...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas.

225
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,510
這種訣竅是 為了別人無法了解的夢想而賭上一切
It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.

226
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,230
好了，好了，伙計們 看好腳步
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

227
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,260
嘿，對了，對了
Hey, that's it. That's it.

228
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,330
手舉起來
Hands up.

229
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,330
刺，刺，刺
Jab, jab, jab.

230
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,780
嘿，冒失鬼
Hey, Flip.

231
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,760
嘿，冒失鬼，過來
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

232
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,850
我想我找到一個你能打敗的人
I think I found somebody you can beat.

233
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,090
我不和女人打
I don't fights women.

234
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,270
為什么不，兄弟？太合適你了 你知道為什么嗎？
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro, because you know why?

235
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,070
因為她--就象你 你可以和他打...
Because she... Like, you, you could fight to him...

236
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,910
...然后可以親親他
...and then you could kiss to him.

237
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,940
然后你還可以再跟他打一次
Then you fight to him one more time.

238
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,780
聽起來真美啊，哥們兒 象一首詩
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

239
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,250
- 象一首詩    - 你他媽墨水不少啊
- It's like poetry.    - You been reading and shit.

240
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,050
- 謝了兄弟    - 伙計，這是個女人？
- Thanks, bro.    - That's a girl, man?

241
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,590
冒失鬼，我想你是對的 看看她的小奶子，就象蚊子咬的包
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

242
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,420
靠，一嘴都含不滿 讓我看看
Man, that's barely even a mouthful. Let me see.

243
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,220
我看了你上一場比賽，謝瑞爾
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

244
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,630
大多數時間臉都朝下 我還意味地板長了奶子呢
Spent so much time face down, I thought the canvas had titties.

245
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,400
地板長了奶子 嘿，看看我，我是謝瑞爾
Canvas has titties. Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

246
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,450
跟拳臺做啊 跟地板做啊
Just humping the canvas. Humping the floor.

247
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,540
靠，兄弟，地板長了奶子？ 挺搞笑的，兄弟
Come on, bro. The floor having titties? That's funny, bro.

248
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,050
閉嘴吧你 你們笑什么呢
Shut up, man. What you laughing at?

249
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,920
哥們兒，扶住沙袋，傻瓜
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

250
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,530
那邊有奶子啊，哥們兒
Some titties right there, man.

251
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,210
冒失鬼，他們什么時候 開始做男式緊身褲了？
Yo, when they start making those tights for men, Flippy?

252
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,260
廢物
Punk.

253
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,370
好了，足夠了 今天足夠了
All right, that's enough. That's enough for the day.

254
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,520
- 我給你按摩一下    - 噢，我沒時間，弗蘭基
- I'll give you a rubdown.    - Oh, I can't, Frankie.

255
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,760
孩子有鋼琴課 我跟格蕾斯說我去送她
Middle one's got a piano lesson. I told Grace I'd drive her.

256
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,030
- 格蕾斯的車壞了？    - 她討厭那輛車
- Something wrong with Gracie's car?    - She hates that car.

257
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,500
想把那輛舊車要回來 可是賣車的說他已經有買家了
Wants the old one back, but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

258
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,680
我也許應該和賣車的談談
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

259
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
那我真是感激不盡
I'd appreciate that.

260
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,710
好吧
Okay.

261
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,990
- 謝謝    - 回頭見
- Thanks.    - See you later.

262
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,210
那家伙按摩成癮 今天他不想按摩
The man's a rubdown whore. Today he doesn't want one.

263
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,170
你在這里到底干不干活？
You ever do any work around here?

264
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,640
如果我是你的話 就不會操心我是不是干活
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

265
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,980
小姑娘看起來有進步啊
Little girl seems to be coming along.

266
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,120
是啊，看起來好象甚至有人在訓練她
Yeah. It's almost like someone's been helping her.

267
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,090
也許她就是天生的 看起來她還有兩把刷子
She might just be a natural. Looks like she's got something.

268
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,360
她還有我的梨球 她有的就這么多
She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.

269
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,930
我想知道她是怎么弄到的
I wonder how the hell she got that.

270
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,000
我也想知道
I wonder.

271
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,640
我想要拿回我的梨球
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

272
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,340
- 這個？    - 沒錯，它是我的
- This bag?    - Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

273
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,360
如果你在這里打它 別人會認為我在訓練你
And if you're hitting it, people will think I'm training you.

274
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,090
老板，這件事就這么糟糕么？
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

275
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,220
對，對，沒錯
Yes. Yes, it is.

276
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,590
你每碰一次這個球 我就損失一些生意
Every time you touch it, you're losing me business out here.

277
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,430
- 我得承認，我在這兒是丟人現眼    - 嗯
- I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.    - Yeah.

278
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,870
你知道，我不能把這個隨便借給別人
Well, I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.

279
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,770
我理解
I understand.

280
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,030
嗯
Yeah.

281
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,810
你看起來是個不錯的女孩
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

282
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,940
- 我可以給你些建議么？    - 感激不盡
- Can I give you some advice?    - I'd appreciate that.

283
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,680
你可以在這里或者其他地方...
You'll find a trainer in this gym or somewhere else...

284
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,930
...找到愿意訓練女孩的訓練師
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

285
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,290
簡直就象是馬戲表演
It's the latest freak show out there.

286
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,870
問題是，他們只會浪費你的時間...
The trouble is, they're gonna be wasting your time...

287
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,060
...因為你已經太老了
...because you're too old.

288
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,370
我不覺得我那么老了
I don't feel that old.

289
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,430
這個嘛，我也不覺得我老 但是你看我還會和21歲的人打拳么？
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

290
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,100
訓練一個拳擊手要四年
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

291
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,370
你多大了？
How old are you?

292
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,050
- 在下個生日之前31歲    - 噢，對呀，你看看
- Thirty-one until my next birthday.    - Oh, well, there you go.

293
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,100
31歲了
Thirty-one.

294
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,630
你不會從31歲才開始練芭蕾舞，不是么？
You wouldn't start training to be a ballerina at 31, would you?

295
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,930
我已經練了大概三年了
Already been working it for three years.

296
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,770
那你連梨球都打不到？ 你到底怎么訓練的？
And you can't hit a speed bag? What kind of training is that?

297
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,950
從來沒有人指導，老板
Never had any, boss.

298
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,050
我不想說，可是能看出來
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

299
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,580
但是必須有人跟你說實話
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

300
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,580
我討厭自己是那個說實話的人
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

301
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,590
嗯
Yeah.

302
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,900
呃，對不起用了您的球，鄧先生
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr.Dunn.

303
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,810
- 你現在不會哭吧？    - 不會，先生
- You're not gonna cry now, are you?    - No, sir.

304
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,940
好吧
Yeah.

305
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,610
給
Here.

306
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,850
- 這個該死的東西你留著吧    - 不，你需要它
- Keep the goddamn thing.    - No, you need it.

307
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,150
不，拿著吧
No, take the bag.

308
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,150
反正我都二十年沒見過它了
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

309
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,720
我還有三個 好好享受它，好嗎？
I've had three since then. Just enjoy it, will you?

310
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,860
- 我只是在自己買之前暫時借用一下    - 嗯
- I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.    - Yeah.

311
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,470
別丟了就行
Just don't lose it.

312
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,280
對，我知道，霍根...
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

313
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,250
...你的拳手是冠軍 所以我們不能對半分...
...your guy's the champ, so we don't split 50s...

314
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,410
...但是如果我連四成--
...but if I don't see 40 percent...

315
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,160
聽著，你同意六四開的時候再給我電話 要不然就別打來了
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40 or don't call me back at all.

316
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,640
- 嘿，威利    - 嘿，弗蘭基
- Hey, Willie.    - Hey, Frankie.

317
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,410
出什么事情了么？
Something wrong?

318
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,770
對不起我就這么來找您 我知道你不喜歡別人來串門
I'm sorry to come by your house like this. I know you don't like people dropping in.

319
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,310
噢，你可不是外人，威利 什么時候來我都歡迎，進來吧
Oh, you're not people, Willie. You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

320
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,020
我是來謝謝您幫格蕾斯把車拿回來
I wanted to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.

321
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
哦，你不用謝我
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

322
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,720
為自己的車多花1000美元 也不算幫什么忙
Paying an extra thousand dollars for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

323
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,460
格蕾斯看見那輛車的時候都哭了
Gracie cried when she saw it.

324
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,590
真的？
Really?

325
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,690
我還想跟您談談業務上的事情
I also needed to talk with you about business.

326
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,890
噢，對了，我剛和霍根通了電話 九月份的冠軍賽都談好了
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan. We're all set for September.

327
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,900
除了分成的問題
Everything but the split.

328
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,930
我得離開你了，弗蘭基
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

329
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,440
什么？
What?

330
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,140
威利，再打兩場就到冠軍賽了
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

331
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,550
不是這個問題，是-- 就好象你說的, 我只有一次機會
It ain't that, it's... It's like you said, I got one shot.

332
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,640
如果我贏了，我就可以在我還能掙 的時候掙盡可能多的錢
If I win, I gotta make as much as I can while I can.

333
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,590
我需要有人能幫我實現
I need somebody in the action who can make things happen.

334
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,390
而且我得在比賽前換經理人
And I gotta make the change before the fight.

335
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,970
他說必須讓他帶我去打冠軍賽 他才會簽下我
Only way this guy say he'd take me is if he took me to the title.

336
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,030
所以我給你安排冠軍賽 然后他帶你去參加
So I get you the title fight, and this guy takes you there?

337
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,430
他說必須這樣
Only way he'd do it.

338
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,140
很抱歉，弗蘭基 我知道你等冠軍很久了
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long you waiting on a title.

339
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,830
我也希望能和你一起
I wish it could've been with me.

340
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,640
米奇 麥克是個生意人 他什么也教不了你
Mickey Mack's a businessman. He can't teach you nothing.

341
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,650
你已經教會了一切我需要知道的
You already taught me everything I need to know.

342
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,200
有些話人們永遠都不愿意聽
There's some things people just don 't want to hear.

343
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,810
我要挑戰“城市機動眼鏡蛇” 還有“刺客”湯馬斯 赫爾斯...
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra, Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

344
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,280
......爭奪次中量級世界冠軍！
...to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world.

345
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,150
丹吉爾，我這個拳套不是白戴的
Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

346
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,320
只是練習一下我的步伐 斯科雷普先生
Just working on my footwork, Mr.Scrap.

347
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,030
丹吉爾，你打一拳 要不然就滾出去
Danger, you throw a punch or get the hell out of this gym.

348
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,870
丹吉爾，好好想想那一拳 我馬上就回來
Danger, while you thinking about that punch, I'll be right back.

349
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,300
我想我會狠狠打那一拳，斯科雷普先生
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr.Scrap.

350
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,550
沒人忍心告訴丹吉爾 赫爾斯好多年前就已經退休了
No one had the heart to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.

351
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,890
威利的事情我聽說了
I heard about Willie.

352
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,230
非常無情，太無情了
That's cold. That's dead cold.

353
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,430
當然，要不是你年紀都這么大了 還不算太殘酷
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so damn old.

354
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,510
嗯，至少我還能用兩只眼睛看
Yeah, well, at least I can see through both eyes.

355
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,180
不過也沒給你帶來多少好處，不是嗎？
Didn't do you a lot of good though, did it?

356
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,410
我還有這個訓練館
Well, I've got the gym.

357
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,980
我這個年紀也不用再訓練拳手了
Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

358
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,640
威利告訴你原因了？
Willie tell you why?

359
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,720
是米奇 米奇有他的關系
It was Mickey. Mickey's got the connections.

360
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,220
這不是因為關系 這是因為你對他沒有信心
Oh, it ain't about connections. It's about you not believing in him.

361
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,090
我發掘了他 在他身上花了八年的心血
Well, I found him, I stuck with him for eight years.

362
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,900
這叫我對他沒信心？
How's that for not believing in him?

363
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,470
兩年前你就可以讓他去打冠軍賽了 他是知道的
You could've got him a title fight two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

364
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,730
他能在你身邊呆這么久 我都感到吃驚
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

365
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,170
這個嘛，去參加比賽 和把腰帶贏回家完全是兩回事
Well, getting there and taking home the belt are two different things.

366
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,240
我應該怎么辦 讓他去參加贏不了的比賽？
What was I supposed to do, just put him in over his head?

367
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,740
不保護他？
Not protect him?

368
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,300
哦，你是在保護他不讓他拿冠軍？
Oh, you were protecting him from the championship.

369
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,960
- 對    - 唔，現在聽起來合情合理了
- Yeah.    - Well, now it makes sense.

370
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,690
那你又怎么樣呢，斯科雷普？ 你的經理當時做了什么？
Well, what about you, Scrap? What did your manager do?

371
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,450
你曾經是多么優秀的拳手 比威利要棒
You were a hell of a fighter, better than Willie.

372
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,560
他給了你一場冠軍賽 還是把你扔在那里...
He get you a title fight, or did he just bust you out...

373
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,530
...讓對手用拳頭不停打你的頭 直到把眼睛打沒了？
...banging your head against other people's fists until you lost your eye?

374
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,500
至少我有個機會
I had my shot.

375
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,260
我去揮舞過我的拳頭 沒有人能說我沒努力過
I went out swinging, and no man can say I didn't.

376
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,660
是啊，我記得
Yeah, well, I remember.

377
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,590
但是請不要因為 我不想讓我的拳手下半輩子...
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter spending the second half of his life...

378
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,340
- ...都在清掃別人吐在地上的口水而介意    - 嗯，是啊
...cleaning up other people's spit.    - Yeah, right.

379
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,640
對，你是聰明人 你還學希臘語呢
Right, you're the smart one. You're the one learning Greek.

380
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,450
是高盧語
It's Gaelic.

381
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,760
你剛剛把自己參加 冠軍爭霸戰的機會保護沒了
Well, you just protected yourself out of a championship fight.

382
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,120
這句話用高盧語怎么說？
How do you say that in Gaelic?

383
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,660
抱歉
Sorry.

384
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,860
謝謝
Thanks.

385
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,170
冠軍和大個子威利 瓊斯 之間的較量繼續進行...
The action continues as the champ is battling Big Willie Jones...

386
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,330
...他被冠軍用 連續的左右拳控制住了
...and commanding him with rights and lefts.

387
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,670
逼到了繩圈的邊上 他在用左拳攻擊....
Up against the ropes, he's hitting him with the left...

388
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,330
拳擊是一種不自然的運動
Boxing is an unnatural act.

389
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,850
因為拳擊中的每樣東西都是逆向的
Because everything in it is backwards.

390
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,220
你想向左移動...
You wanna move to the left...

391
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,290
... 不是向左邁步 而是右腳趾用力
...you don't step left, you push on the right toe.

392
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,430
向右移動的時候左腳趾用力
To move right, you use your left toe.

393
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,520
你要迎著痛苦而上 而不是...
Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do...

394
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,700
...象有理智的人那樣躲避
...you step into it.

395
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,660
大個子威利反擊了，噢，天哪 他一記右手拳擊中了衛冕拳王
But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God, he hits the champ with a right hand.

396
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,250
衛冕拳王倒下了
And the champ is down.

397
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,720
女士們先生們 裁判正在數點
Ladies and gentleman, the ref is in for the count.

398
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,250
大個子威利 瓊斯 成為了新的世界冠軍
And Big Willie Jones is the new champion of the world.

399
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,050
今晚發生的一切令人難以置信...
It's unbelievable how this has taken place tonight...

400
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,120
...不過朋友們，新的冠軍產生了
...but there you have it, folks, a new champion.

401
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,790
拳擊中的每樣東西都是逆向的
Everything in boxing is backwards.

402
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,140
要芝士漢堡嗎？
Want a cheeseburger?

403
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,110
- 你給我買了個芝士漢堡？    - 嗯
- You bought me a cheeseburger?    - Yeah.

404
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,310
我從沒見你給別人買過芝士漢堡
I never see you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

405
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,510
我點了，可我吃不了，你愿意吃么？
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it. You want it?

406
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,380
噢，我猜地球又開始轉了
Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.

407
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,070
- 你看比賽了么？    - 嗯，看了
- You watch the fight?    - Yeah, I watched it.

408
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,960
威利打的不錯
Willie did good.

409
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,070
這就是你要說的？
That's what you've got to say?

410
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,460
威利贏了，不是嗎？ 他打的不錯
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

411
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:48,240
我看出你正在改變自己 學著敞開心扉，很不錯
I see you been working on yourself, learning to open up. That's good work.

412
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,230
你看了？
You watch it?

413
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,140
是啊，我有HBO臺
Yeah, I got HBO.

414
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,800
你怎么可能看得起HBO？
Now, how can you afford HBO?

415
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,800
我從什么時候起就叫你省錢了？
How long have I been telling you to save your money?

416
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,500
從我和“臺風”路易斯 強森...
Ever since I fought Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

417
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,490
...在密西西比州圖皮洛市的 俱樂部體育館比賽以后
...at the Stadium Club in Tupelo, Mississippi.

418
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,720
- 真的？    - 是的
- That true?    - Yeah.

419
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,560
經理人跑路了 讓我們自己搭車回家
Manager ran off and left you and me to hitch home.

420
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,030
你難道什么都不記得了么？
Don't you remember nothing?

421
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,660
我記得走到一半的時候 覺得自己要被私刑處死了
Well, I remember walking halfway and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

422
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,740
我記得你把口袋空空的我 扔在那個加油站
I remember you leaving me with my dick in my hand behind that gas station.

423
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,380
是啊，我當時搭到一個便車 我一關上門那家伙就開走了
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.

424
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,060
后來我不得不又往回走了兩英里
I had to walk back two miles.

425
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,050
你的良心占了上風 這就是原因
Your conscience got the better of you, that's what.

426
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,960
那他媽是什么聲音？
What the hell's that?

427
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,920
今天是她的生日
It's her birthday.

428
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,270
你的呼吸方法不對 這就是為什么你大口喘氣
You're not breathing right. That's why you're panting.

429
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,720
今天是你生日，是嗎？
So it's your birthday, huh?

430
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,420
那你多大了？
How old does that make you?

431
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,210
我32了，鄧先生
I'm 32, Mr.Dunn.

432
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,950
我在這里慶祝 我又花了一年的時間洗盤子和當女招待
I'm celebrating that I spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing...

433
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,120
我從13歲就開始干這些了
...which is what I been doing since 13.

434
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,310
根據您的理論 我37歲之前打不出一記象樣的拳...
And according to you, I'll be 37 before I can even throw a decent punch...

435
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,220
...打了這個梨球一個月 一點進展也沒有...
...which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere...

436
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,590
...我現在認識到 上帝的現實也許就是這樣
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

437
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,900
另外的現實是，我的哥哥在監獄里
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

438
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,680
我的妹妹假裝 自己的一個孩子還活著，詐騙福利金
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her kids is still alive...

439
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,910
我爸爸死了 我媽有312磅重
...my daddy's dead, and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

440
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,900
如果我還有理智的話 我應該回家去
If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home...

441
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,780
找個二手的活動房屋 買個炸鍋，再來點夾心餅干
...find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

442
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,520
問題是，這是唯一我喜歡做的事情
The problem is, this is the only thing I ever felt good doing.

443
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,100
如果對于拳擊來說我太老了 那我就一無所有
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

444
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,760
這下你滿意了吧？
That enough truth to suit you?

445
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,790
這是你的梨球？
This your speed bag?

446
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,400
把你的放在臺子后面了 真希望能說那是我用壞的
Put yours behind the counter. Wish I could say I wore it out.

447
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,490
好了，停一下，停一下
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

448
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,790
我要教你幾件事情 然后給你找個訓練師
I'll show you a few things, and then we'll get you a trainer.

449
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,600
不用了，抱歉
No, sorry.

450
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,240
- 你還打算討價還價？    - 是的，先生
- You're in a position to negotiate?    - Yes, sir.

451
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,820
是的，因為我知道如果你正確的訓練我 我會成為冠軍
Because I know if you train me right, I'm gonna be a champ.

452
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,700
我見過你看著我的樣子
I seen you looking at me.

453
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,810
- 是的，用憐憫的眼神    - 你不要這么說
- Yeah, out of pity.    - Don't you say that.

454
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,240
你不要這么說，如果不是事實的話
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

455
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,130
我要的是訓練師
I want a trainer.

456
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,210
我不要施舍 我也不要幫忙
I don't want charity, and I don't want favors.

457
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,680
如果你不感興趣，那我還要繼續慶祝
If you're not interested, then I got more celebrating to do.

458
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,810
停，停，停
Stop, stop, stop.

459
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,350
該死，停下來 你到底在做什么？
Goddamn it, stop. What the hell are you doing?

460
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,720
好吧
Okay.

461
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,470
如果我來教你--
If I'm gonna take you on...

462
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,130
- 你一定不會后悔的    - 聽我說就行了
- You won't never regret it.    - Look, just listen to me.

463
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,140
- 如果我來教你--    - 我保證我會非常努力
- If I take you on...    - I promise I'll work so hard.

464
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,710
天，這已經是個錯誤了
God, this is a mistake already.

465
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,310
我聽著呢，老板
I'm listening, boss.

466
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,710
如果我來教你，你一句話也不要說 你不能對我有疑問
If I take you on, you don't say anything, you don't question me.

467
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,920
不要問我問題 除了“是，弗蘭基”以外什么也不要說
You don't ask why, you don't say anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

468
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,190
還有我會試著忘記 你是個女孩這個事實
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact that you're a girl.

469
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,590
我就要求這么多
That's all I ask.

470
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,250
另外如果你受傷了別對我哭
And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

471
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,020
- 好的    - 我們一言為定
- Alrighty.    - We got a deal.

472
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,370
沒，還沒有
No, not quite.

473
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,500
我教你怎么打拳
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

474
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,370
然后給你找個經理人 我就放手不管了
...then we'll get you a manager, and I'm off down the road.

475
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,140
- 我不想和你爭，不過--    - 別跟我爭，我們就這么辦
- I hate to argue with you, but...    - Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

476
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,080
我會教你一切你需要知道的 然后你自己去掙個一百萬美元
I teach you all you need to know, and you go off and make a million dollars.

477
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,180
我不管 被人打掉牙齒，我也不管
I don't care. You get your teeth knocked out, I don't care.

478
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,550
我不想聽 這個東西就是這樣
I don't wanna hear about it. That's just the way it's gonna be.

479
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,280
只有這樣我才同意教你
It's the only way I'll do it.

480
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,690
好的
All right.

481
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,790
在訓練場里我注意到一件事 你從來不移動你的腳
Now, one of the things I've noticed around the gym is you never move your feet.

482
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,270
你總是呆呆的站在那里 你必須要移動你的腳
You stand there just flat-footed. You've gotta move your feet.

483
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,600
這是我將教會你最有用的東西之一
That's one of the best things I can teach you.

484
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,610
那么，你應該這么做
So here's what you do.

485
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,250
把自己-- 膝蓋彎曲一點
You get yourself... Bend your knees a little bit.

486
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,310
擺好運動姿態 就好像你打算要打什么一樣
Get in an athletic position. Look like you're gonna hit something.

487
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,560
- 怎么做，老板？    - 就--打--梨球就行了
- Move them how, boss?    - Just... Go... Hit the bag.

488
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,220
- 停    - 我做錯什么了？
- Stop.    - What'd I do wrong?

489
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,560
好，你做錯了兩件事情
Okay, you did two things wrong.

490
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,060
第一，你問了我一個問題 第二，你又問了一個問題
One is you asked a question, and two is you asked another question.

491
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,400
現在我要你做的 不是要打得多么狠
Now, what I want you to do, it's not about hitting it hard...

492
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,510
而是打得多么好 所以看著我
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

493
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,300
如果你愿意的話可以和我一起數
You can count with me if you want.

494
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,310
就是數數 數一的時候，我打一下球
It's just count. On a one-count, I hit right through the bag.

495
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,470
- 你能再示范一次么？    - 數--
- Can you show me that again?    - I just...

496
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,680
數一就行了，拜托
Just say "one," please.

497
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,340
- 一    - 好
- One.    - Okay.

498
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,350
- 一，好    - 一
- One. Okay.    - One.

499
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,650
對，就說一 很好，很好
Yeah, just say "one." That's good. That's good.

500
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,490
然后我移動到我的右腳 你可以看到我的重心都轉移到右腳
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

501
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:15,870
然后我用我的手背攻擊 就象用冰錐碎冰
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

502
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,410
然后我轉過來，轉移到我的左腳 然后用右手攻擊
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot, and I hit it with my right hand.

503
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,140
還是冰錐的動作
And ice pick maneuver again.

504
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,370
再轉到右腳上 再攻擊右側
And I come over on my right foot and hit it right.

505
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,680
就看著我的腳步
Don't watch anything but my feet.

506
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,620
就這么做 不停練習
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

507
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,560
你示范他們怎么站立 雙腳和肩膀平行
You show them how to stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.

508
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,640
訓練一名拳手 你必須在精神上把他們剝光
To make a fighter, you gotta strip them down to bare wood.

509
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,300
死了再休息
Rest when you're dead.

510
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,140
過來
Come here.

511
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,320
你不能只是 叫他們忘記以前知道的事情...
You can't just tell them to forget everything you know...

512
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,550
... 你要叫他們從骨子里忘記
...you gotta make them forget it in their bones.

513
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,900
讓他們疲憊到只聽你的話
Make them so tired they only listen to you.

514
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,130
只能聽見你的聲音 只做你叫他們做的事情，不做其他事
Only hear your voice, only do what you say, and nothing else.

515
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,530
腳步移動
Move your feet.

516
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,700
腳步移動起來 移動起來讓我看
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

517
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,950
教他們怎么保持平衡 怎么讓對手失去平衡
Show them how to keep their balance and take it away from the other guy.

518
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,860
別這么低，看著我 右勾拳，然后向右
Not so low. Look at me. Right hook and just turn right.

519
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,960
如何用右腳趾產生動力
How to generate momentum off your right toe.

520
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,470
出刺拳時如何彎曲膝蓋
And how to flex your knees when you fire a jab.

521
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,010
如何在后退中攻擊 好讓對手在追擊你時有所顧忌
How to fight backing up, so that the other guy doesn't wanna come after you.

522
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,820
然后你要再全部教他們一遍
Then you gotta show them all over again.

523
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,180
一遍又一遍...
Over and over and over...

524
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,330
...直到他們感覺一切與生俱來
...till they think they were born that way.

525
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,360
轉移
Shift.

526
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,430
轉移位置
Shift away.

527
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,630
好了，今天就到這里
Okay. That's enough for today.

528
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,240
不錯，好姑娘
Good work. Good girl.

529
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,200
老板，你覺得我可以打比賽了么？
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

530
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,170
嘿，你過來
Hey. Hey, come here.

531
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,200
你都喘不過氣了
You're not breathing.

532
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,570
不想和你爭論
Hate to disagree with you.

533
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,010
你一有壓力就喜歡屏住呼吸
Every time you get under pressure, you're holding your breath.

534
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,620
- 從現在開始別這么做    - 好的
- Now, stop doing that.    - Okay.

535
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,080
除了這一點，我做得很好，是吧？
But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?

536
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,150
- 我是說，對于女孩來講    - 我不訓練女孩
- I mean, for a girl.    - I don't train girls.

537
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,120
老板，你覺得我可以參加比賽了么
Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?

538
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,820
嗯，我們先找個經理人 然后我們再看看，好嗎？
Well, we'll get a manager, and we'll find out, won't we?

539
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,030
我是想找一個 可是你一直讓我抽不出時間來
I'd like to, but you been keeping me too busy.

540
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,670
- 有家人嗎，老板？    - 什么？
- Got any family, boss?    - What?

541
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,610
我看你把所有的時間都花在我的身上了 我不知道你有沒有家人
You been spending all this time with me, I didn't know if you had any.

542
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,850
沒有
No.

543
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,890
呃，我是有個女兒，叫凱蒂
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

544
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,920
她就是家人啊
That's family.

545
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,790
但是我們并不那么親近
We're not exactly close.

546
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,700
她多重？
How much she weigh?

547
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,260
什么？
What?

548
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,630
我的家庭問題和體重成正比
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

549
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,600
是嗎
Yeah.

550
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,970
不是很重
Not very big.

551
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,240
曾經很愛運動 不知道現在還有沒有堅持
Used to be real athletic. Don't know if she kept it up.

552
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,810
那么，你怎么想？
So, what do you think?

553
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,890
我可以參加比賽了么？
I ready for a fight?

554
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,460
嘿，賽利
Hey, Sally.

555
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,590
過來一下，好嗎？
Come here for a minute, will you?

556
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,300
弗蘭基，能不能到后面來跟我談談？
Frankie, I need to see you in the back for a minute, okay?

557
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,960
- 我能和你說句話么？    - 賽利是個很優秀的經理人
- Can I see you a minute?    - Sally here's a real good manager.

558
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,100
他手下還有幾個拿過金手套的選手 想要女孩嗎，賽利？
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys. Looking for a girl, Sally?

559
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,500
如果有優秀人選的話
I'm looking for a good one.

560
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,920
看，這不就有了
Well, see, there you go.

561
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,450
很高興和你合作，小姐
Nice working with you, girlie.

562
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,330
- 你有什么事？    - 沒什么，沒什么
- What'd you want?    - Nothing. It's nothing.

563
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:49,870
我沒撒謊，我已經看過你訓練了 你的左拳很厲害
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work. You got a hell of a left.

564
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,770
謝謝你
Thank you.

565
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,370
那你要不要試試？ 看看是不是合適？
So you wanna give this a try? See if it's a fit?

566
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,360
- 噢，當然    - 好
- Yeah, sure.    - Good.

567
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,370
好，因為我覺得你已經夠資格比賽了
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

568
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,090
分開
Break.

569
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,130
我到底做錯了什么，賽利？ 每次我逼近都被她痛擊
What am I doing wrong, Sally? Every time I get inside, she's on me.

570
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,000
你做得很好 你就快把她拖垮了，繼續出拳
You're doing great. You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

571
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,810
- 我不好，我要輸了    - 你就快把她拖垮了
- I ain't doing great, I'm losing.    - You're wearing her down.

572
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,310
沒事吧，親愛的？看得清嗎？
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

573
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,910
- 加油    - 加油
- Come on.    - Do it.

574
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,610
加油，加油！
Come on, let's do this!

575
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,050
沒錯！
That's it!

576
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,100
今晚真不錯，不是嗎？
Nice night, eh?

577
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,200
老天
Jesus Christ.

578
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,240
那姑娘是羅尼 華盛頓的拳手
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

579
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,200
非常優秀的拳手
Hell of a fighter.

580
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,430
11場全勝
11-0.

581
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,580
左拳，左拳舉起來
Your left. Keep your left up.

582
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,440
羅尼旗下有很多優秀拳手
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

583
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,750
輕量級冠軍喬伊 阿達喬也在他旗下
He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ?

584
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,410
對
Yeah.

585
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,620
你的左拳，該死
Your left, damn it.

586
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,190
要是我肯定不會選她做第一個對手 不過賽利是個好經理人
Wouldn't have been my choice for her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

587
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,100
- 他一定認為她能打敗她    - 天哪
- He must think she can take her.    - Jesus H.

588
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,900
左拳，左拳舉起來
Your left. Keep your left up.

589
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,330
你認為這么遠的地方她能聽見？
You think she can hear you from back here?

590
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,150
當然，就算麥琪輸了 對賽利也算不了什么
Of course, if Maggie loses, it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

591
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,310
也許還對他有幫助
Might even help him.

592
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,390
讓羅尼的女選手再勝一場...
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

593
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,120
...羅尼也許會讓賽利的輕量級拳手 去挑戰喬伊 阿達喬的冠軍
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight fight Joey Adagio for the title.

594
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,730
賽利想要安排一場和阿達喬的比賽？
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

595
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,330
嘿，我知道什么？
Hey, what do I know?

596
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,230
我只是來欣賞比賽
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

597
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,960
上帝
Mother of God.

598
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,330
好了，分開
Okay, break.

599
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,870
嘿，過來，過來
Hey. Come here, come here.

600
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,440
嘿，過來
Hey. Get over here.

601
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,440
你老是放低左拳 別再放低左拳了
You're dropping your left hand. Quit dropping your left hand.

602
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,340
嘿，弗蘭基 你能不能讓我跟我的拳手談談？
Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?

603
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,920
你干得還真不賴啊 你也是這樣指導你的輕量級選手的？
You're doing a hell of a job. Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

604
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,010
我是鄧
Dunn.

605
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,680
- 你在干什么？    - 我在說話，你在干什么？
- What are you doing?    - I'm talking. What are you doing?

606
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,760
- 這是你的拳手么？    - 是我的拳手
- Is this your fighter?    - It's my fighter.

607
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,320
真的不是那么合適，賽利
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

608
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,630
好吧，你來帶她 反正她也屁都不會打
Fine, you take her. She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

609
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,200
- 誰告訴我到底怎么回事    - 我遲到了，賽利剛才只是替我
- Somebody tell me what's going on.    - I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

610
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,810
你說她是你的拳手？
You telling me this is your fighter?

611
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,380
對，是我的拳手
Yeah, this is my fighter.

612
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,240
那么你有10秒的時間
Then you got 10 seconds.

613
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,710
我把左手舉起來了 可當我出拳的時候，就總是會放下去
I keep holding my left up, then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

614
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,940
- 那就放下去好了    - 那就簡單多了
- Well, let it drop.    - That'd be a lot easier.

615
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,280
她認為她摸透你了
She thinks she knows you.

616
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,480
你左手每次放下 她就從上面打過來
Every time you drop it, she comes right over the top.

617
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,890
那你就等著她，明白嗎？ 她腦子里就這么多東西
So you just wait for her, see? That's all she's thinking about.

618
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,050
- 她收回右拳準備出擊的時--你聽見了嗎?    - 我聽著呢，老板
- When she cocks that right hand... You hear?    - I hear you, boss.

619
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,220
如果她那么做，你就向旁邊躲一步 然后給她一記再見勾拳
When she does, step to the side and come with a good-night hook.

620
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,730
- 能行嗎？    - 看我的吧
- Got one?    - Got it right here.

621
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,660
- 好    - 開始吧，我等著呢
- Okay.    - Fight, or I'm calling it.

622
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,830
- 去教訓她吧    - 拳手的身體了解拳手自己所不了解的東西
- Go give it to her.    - The body knows what fighters don 't.

623
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,240
如何保護自己
How to protect itself.

624
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:19,210
脖子只能轉動那么多
A neck can only twist so far.

625
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,580
哪怕再多轉一毫米 身體就會說：
Twist it just a hair more, and the body says:

626
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,910
“嘿，還是讓我來吧 因為很明顯你不知道你自己在做什么”
"Hey, I'll take it from here because you obviously don't know what you're doing."

627
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,920
到中立區去
Neutral corner.

628
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,260
- 看見她怎么出拳了么？    - 嗯
- See the way she did that?    - Yeah.

629
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,390
舒格 雷就會這么做 這女人好象他一樣
Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.

630
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,190
“躺下，休息 等你恢復知覺我們再談”
"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk about this when you regain your senses."

631
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,600
這個叫做擊倒心理
It's called the knockout mechanism.

632
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,470
現在放松一點 你干得不錯
Don't get all carried away, now. You did good.

633
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,580
謝了，老板
Thanks, boss.

634
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,310
你....你忘了規矩
You... You forgot the rule.

635
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,910
- 告訴我規矩是什么？    - 左手要抬起？
- Now, what is the rule?    - Keep my left up?

636
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,050
規矩是要隨時保護自己
It's to protect yourself at all times.

637
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,180
好，規矩是什么？
Now, what is the rule?

638
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,690
- 隨時保護我自己    - 很好，很好
- Protect myself at all times.    - Good, good.

639
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,090
你放棄了我 那對我是什么樣的保護？
You gave me away. How was that protecting me?

640
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,920
那不是保護
It wasn't.

641
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,550
沒關系了
It's okay.

642
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,100
- 我會練習我的左手的，老板    - 把水喝了
- I'll work on my left, boss.    - Drink your water.

643
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,900
除了這一點，我怎么樣？
Other than that, how'd I do?

644
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,210
很好，你做得很好
Fine. You did fine.

645
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,700
你還會再放棄我么？
You gonna leave me again?

646
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,540
永遠不會
Never.

647
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,080
你工作的那個地方 有沒有手工制檸檬酥皮派？
That place you work, do they have homemade lemon meringue pie there?

648
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,250
- 當然有    - 不是罐裝餡料的那種垃圾
- Sure.    - Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

649
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,120
噢，是很大罐的那種 標簽上寫著“手工制作”
Oh, big can, yay size. Says "homemade" on the label.

650
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,620
- 我想你這個周末休息一下    - 這才星期四
- I want you to take the weekend off.    - It's only Thursday.

651
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,500
- 你打算要和我爭？    - 我知道最好不要有這個想法，老板
- You gonna argue with me?    - Know better than to do that, boss.

652
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,900
嗯，很好
Well, good.

653
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,740
某種角度來看，拳手大都很頑固
All fighters are pigheaded some way or other.

654
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,610
他們的某個部分總覺得 在某件事情上自己比別人知道的更多
Some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something.

655
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,050
你能不能花幾分鐘講講圣母懷胎？
Can you spare a few minutes for the Immaculate Conception?

656
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:09,520
實際上，就算他們錯了...
Truth is, even if they're wrong...

657
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,680
...就算有那么件事情 可以把他們都毀了...
...even if that one thing is gonna be the ruin of them...

658
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,690
...如果你能把他們徹底打敗 那他們就不算是拳手了
...if you can beat that last bit out of them, then they ain 't fighters at all.

659
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,130
- 我記得我說過讓你周一再來    - 沒錯，老板
- Thought I said I'd see you Monday.    - You sure did, boss.

660
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,030
就是昨晚說的
That was last night.

661
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,000
你說不要和你爭論
You said not to argue with you.

662
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,110
該死的女人總是不按我的指揮做事
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

663
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,250
想聽我的建議么？
You want my advice?

664
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,890
什么？
What?

665
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,310
你的鞋子哪去了？
Where are your shoes?

666
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,690
我給我的腳透透風
I'm airing out my feet.

667
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,300
你的襪子上凈是大洞
You got big holes in your socks.

668
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,330
噢，沒有那么大啦
Oh, they're not that big.

669
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,370
我不是給你錢去買新的了嗎？
Didn't I give you money for some new ones?

670
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,700
這是我的睡襪
These are my sleeping socks.

671
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,740
我的腳晚上需要一些新鮮空氣
My feet like a little air at night.

672
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,580
那你為什么要在白天穿它們？
How come you're wearing them in the daytime, then?

673
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,740
因為我白天穿的襪子上洞太多了
Because my daytime socks got too many holes in them.

674
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:21,590
那好，如果我多給你些錢 你能去買幾雙新的么？
Well, if I give you some more money, you buy some new socks.

675
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,560
拜托？
Please?

676
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,770
嗯，很有吸引力 不過我不能保證
Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.

677
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,870
也許會跑到跑道上去
Might find its way to the track.

678
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,620
比賽結束，比賽結束
It's over. It's over.

679
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,140
麥琪沒花多少時間就取得連勝
Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.

680
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,020
我解決了呼吸的問題.
I got the breathing thing down.

681
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,750
不，你還是呼吸不正確 因為你第一回合就把對方打倒了
No, you ain't breathing because you're knocking them out in the first round.

682
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,450
- 我還以為那就是重點    - 重點是讓自己變強
- Thought that was the point.    - The point is to get good.

683
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,690
把對方第一回合就擊倒 自己怎么可能進步
Can't get good if you keep knocking them out first round.

684
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,060
我怎么給你再找到對手？
How am I gonna get you fights?

685
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,170
沒人愿意自己的拳手被羞辱
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed, now.

686
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,970
為什么我還要 打這種四回合比賽，老板？
Why am I still doing four-rounders, boss?

687
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,740
因為你的肺還打不了六回合
Because you haven't got the lungs for six rounds.

688
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,110
我一直這么在第一回合 就把她們擊倒就行了
I do if I keep knocking them out in the first round.

689
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,280
弗蘭基讓她又打了場四回合比賽...
Frankie made her fight one more four-rounder...

690
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,650
...只是讓她明白誰說了算數
...just to let her know who was boss.

691
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,690
三，四，五...
Three, four, five...

692
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,700
...六，七....
...six, seven...

693
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,760
抱歉，老板
Sorry, boss.

694
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,990
麥琪對此毫不懷疑
Maggie left no doubt about it.

695
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,140
好了，加油
All right, let's do it.

696
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,280
但是第一場六回合賽并沒那么輕松
Her first six-rounder didn't go quite as smooth.

697
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,860
起來！
Get up!

698
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,330
到你的角落去
To your corner.

699
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,660
- 三，四，五...    - 起來
- Three, four, five...    - Get up.

700
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,060
- ...六，七...    - 起來
...six, seven...    - Get up.

701
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,670
- ...八，九，十，比賽結束    - 你能做到
...eight, nine, ten. It's over.    - You can do this.

702
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,990
麥琪到了第一回合結尾才將對方擊倒
Maggie didn't knock her out till the end of the first round.

703
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:05,720
在那以后，沒有經理愿意 讓自己的拳手和麥琪交手
After that, no manager wanted to put his fighter in with Maggie.

704
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,420
弗蘭基不得不自己討腰包 來給她安排比賽...
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights...

705
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:17,030
...靠給對方經理人賄賂 來增加對方參賽的興趣
...sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side.

706
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,080
這并沒能持續太久
That only worked for so long.

707
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,390
然后弗蘭基做了他不愿意做的事
Then Frankie did something he hated doing.

708
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,050
他冒了次險
He took a chance.

709
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,550
開始
Box.

710
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,950
他把她晉升了一個級別
He moved her up in class.

711
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,430
這差點成為一個錯誤
That could've been a mistake.

712
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,720
注意右邊！
Watch the right!

713
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,280
注意，注意
Watch it. Watch it.

714
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,060
分開，分開，后退，時間到
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

715
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,110
該死，該死，該死
Damn, damn, damn.

716
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,560
給我們兩秒鐘，好嗎？
Give us two seconds, will you?

717
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,940
- 好    - 兩秒鐘就好
- Okay.    - Just two seconds.

718
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,500
- 你的鼻梁骨斷了    - 噢，該死
- Your nose is broke.    - Oh, damn.

719
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,440
- 弄好它    - 我沒辦法，我沒辦法
- Fix it.    - I can't, I can't.

720
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,140
- 你可以的    - 我不行，我準備棄權了
- You can fix it.    - I can't. I've gotta call it.

721
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,410
我見你做過，弄好它
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

722
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:49,410
我能把它按回去 但是我不能給你止血
I can snap it back into place, but I can't stop the bleeding.

723
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,110
醫務裁判會中止比賽的
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

724
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,030
求你，弗蘭基，你要是能幫我止血 我就能打倒她
Please, Frankie, if you can stop the blood, I can beat her.

725
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,370
咬住這個
Bite down on this.

726
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,540
- 吸氣    - 什么？
- Inhale.    - What?

727
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,410
- 吸氣    - 什么
- Inhale.    - What?

728
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,750
吸氣
Breathe in.

729
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,330
- 可以？    - 嗯，沒問題
- Okay, huh?    - Yeah, it's okay.

730
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,600
好，這個變成噴泉之前你有20秒鐘...
All right, you got 20 seconds before this turns into a geyser...

731
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,910
...血會噴到整個前排座位上的
...and it's gonna spray all over the front row.

732
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,270
你只有20秒
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

733
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,650
去吧
Now get going.

734
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,230
回到你的角落去
Go to your corner.

735
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,700
三，四，五...
Three, four, five...

736
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,570
- 加油，呼吸，呼吸    - ...六，七，八...
- Come on, breathe. Breathe. ...six, seven, eight...

737
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,300
...九，十
...nine, ten.

738
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,200
“莫 庫什勒”
Mo cuishle.

739
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,480
- 好！    - 太棒了！
- All right!    - Yeah!

740
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,760
對
Right.

741
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,730
你在讀什么
What you reading?

742
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,860
她說什么？
What's she saying?

743
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,400
想知道你在讀什么
Wants to know what you're reading.

744
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,870
是葉芝的作品（愛爾蘭著名詩人） 仰著點頭
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

745
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,270
你為什么不跟她說說葉芝呢？
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her.

746
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:45,480
告訴她那是怎樣一件樂事
Show her what a treat that is.

747
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,610
他媽的什么時候才能輪到她？
When the hell they gonna get to her?

748
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:50,510
我很好，弗蘭基
I'm okay, Frankie.

749
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,750
- 你今天學到了什么？    - 隨時保護自己
- What'd you learn tonight?    - Always protect myself.

750
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,030
- 規矩是什么？    - 隨時保護自己
- What's the rule?    - Always protect myself.

751
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,520
- 麥琪 菲斯杰拉德?    - 在這里
- Margaret Fitzgerald?    - Here.

752
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,030
我就在這兒等你
I'll be right here.

753
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,990
- 你怎么樣？    - 我？
- How you doing?    - Me?

754
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,580
- 對，你    - 我又沒有受傷
- Yeah, you.    - I'm not the one who's hurt.

755
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,250
鼻子斷了并不是那么受傷
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

756
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:32,290
為什么你要告訴我這個？
Why are you telling me that?

757
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,360
沒有原因
No reason.

758
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,910
可有些傷太深了 或是離骨頭太近
But some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone.

759
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:44,580
不管你如何努力，都不能止血
And no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.

760
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,570
- 你給你女兒寫信了么？    - 每周都寫
- Did you write your daughter?    - Every week.

761
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,100
我真不明白你為什么要來教堂
I've no idea why you come to church.

762
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:29,010
在連續十二場比賽擊倒對手勝出后 弗蘭基得到幾個非常不錯的邀請
After her 12th straight knockout, Frankie got a couple of real good offers.

763
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,740
第一個邀請是和 “蘭熊”比麗 奧斯特曼...
The first was to fight Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...

764
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,720
...爭奪WBA次中量級頭銜
...for the WBA welterweight title.

765
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,010
“蘭熊”比麗
Billie "The Blue Bear."

766
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,310
比麗原來是東柏林的妓女
Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin.

767
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:48,130
她是這個級別里 手法最骯臟的拳手，臭名遠揚
Had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

768
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,540
她看起來一點也不在乎...
Didn't seem to matter to her...

769
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,780
...這樣的動作可能會致人于死地
...that something like that could kill a person.

770
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,890
觀眾喜歡她
And the crowds loved her.

771
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,350
他沒告訴她就把這場比賽拒絕了.
He turned it down without even telling her.

772
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,780
下一個邀請是去挑戰英國冠軍
The next was to fight the British champ...

773
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,700
- 一個剛被比麗擊敗的牙買加女孩    - 喂？
- ...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.    - Hello?

774
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,500
不感興趣
Not interested.

775
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,900
他也沒接受那個邀請
He turned that down too.

776
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,890
可是很大一筆錢哪，老板
That's a lot of money, boss.

777
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,520
是啊，你掙錢了 為什么還在這里工作？
Yeah, you're making money. What are you still working here for?

778
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,390
那是冠軍賽，對吧？
It's a title match, right?

779
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,540
你是英國人么？ 那個冠軍你拿不走的
Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.

780
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,560
她沒什么好輸的 你也沒什么好贏的
She's got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win.

781
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,400
很可能仍然是一場不錯的比賽呢
Might still be a good fight.

782
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,100
是啊，我剛把你升上次中量級
Yeah, I just... I just brought you up to welterweight.

783
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,720
能和跟你水平相當的選手打就不錯了 還想他媽去挑戰那些冠軍？
Too good to fight these contenders, you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

784
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,410
我沒發現有和我水平相當的選手啊
Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.

785
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,410
如果你想的話 隨時可以換經理
Well, you can get yourself another manager any time you want.

786
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,840
實際上，如果你有能力 把自己的臉保護得好一點的話...
In fact, if you'd learn to protect your face a little better...

787
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,110
...我才不會拒絕這筆錢呢
...I wouldn't have to turn down this money.

788
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,020
我的臉暴露出那么多 可還沒被擊倒過，真是個奇跡
My face is out there so much it's a miracle I haven't been knocked out yet.

789
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,860
你今晚不要繼續訓練了
No, you can't work here anymore tonight.

790
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,690
我定了位子
I made us a reservation.

791
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,690
你去洗個澡吧
You might wanna shower.

792
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,010
你的
Here you go.

793
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,050
你的
Here you go.

794
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,250
這是什么？
What's this?

795
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,720
你想要的東西 這不是什么秘密
Well, it ain't no big secret what you're wishing for.

796
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,730
把蠟燭吹了
Go on and blow.

797
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,360
謝謝你
Thank you.

798
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,970
33歲不算大的
Thirty-three ain't so old.

799
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,540
我39歲的時候還在參賽
I was still fighting at 39.

800
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,370
我打了23年
Fought for 23 years.

801
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,780
最近怎么樣，斯科雷普
How's it going, Scrap?

802
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,620
不錯，米奇
Doing good, Mickey.

803
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,490
不錯
Doing good.

804
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,420
- 你要什么？    - 咖啡
- What'll you have?    - Coffee.

805
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,200
你們兩個不講話？
You two not speaking?

806
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,870
不太認識他
Don't hardly know him.

807
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:28,010
我在37歲生日之后遇到了弗蘭基
I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday.

808
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,610
那時他干的工作是給拳手包扎傷口
He was picking up cut work.

809
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:36,290
我認為不可能的時候 他總能給我包扎好
He used to patch me up when I thought it was impossible.

810
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,620
有他在賽場邊真不錯
Good man to have in your corner.

811
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,500
是啊
Yes, he is.

812
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,260
我最后一次比賽，在圣伯蒂諾 他也陪了我全場
He stayed with me through my last fight in San Berdu.

813
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,510
我的經理喝醉了，不知所蹤
My manager was off getting drunk somewhere...

814
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,530
只有我和弗蘭基
...and it was just Frankie and me.

815
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,250
我被打得暈頭轉向
I was taking a hellacious beating.

816
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,020
每個人最多能參加多少比賽 都有個數字
Everybody's got a particular number of fights in him.

817
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,660
沒人告訴你那個數字是多少
Nobody tells you what that number is.

818
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,260
我的是109場
Mine was 109.

819
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,130
我只是不愿承認
I just didn't want to admit it.

820
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,230
第四回合
Fourth round, this...

821
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,370
這里被打開了口子
...cut opens up.

822
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,640
鮮血擁進我的眼睛里
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

823
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,500
他們本應該終止那場比賽的 但是，媽的，我是個在圣伯蒂諾的黑人
They should've stopped the fight, but, hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

824
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,880
我到那里就是去流血的
Blood was what I was there for.

825
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:37,310
一回合接著一回合 我不斷地讓弗蘭基給我包扎
Round after round, I kept getting Frankie to patch me up.

826
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,880
他想扔毛巾認輸...
He's talking about throwing in the towel...

827
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,390
...但他不是我的經理人 什么也不能扔
...but he ain't my manager, he can't throw in nothing.

828
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,690
一回合接著一回合...
Round after round...

829
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,200
...他一直跟我爭吵
...he's arguing with me.

830
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:54,660
我幾乎是在笑他，因為，媽的 好象是打在他身上似的
And I'm almost laughing because, hell, it's getting more to him than to me.

831
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,060
我打了15回合
I go 15 rounds...

832
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,470
裁判判我輸了
...Iose by decision.

833
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,510
第二天早上，我的眼睛沒了
Next morning, I lose the eye.

834
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,540
23年來，他從來沒說起過這件事
In 23 years, he's never said a thing about it.

835
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:14,550
沒這個必要 每次他看我，我都能從他的臉上讀出來
Doesn't have to. I can see it in his face every time he looks at me.

836
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,190
某種程度上
Somehow...

837
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,860
弗蘭基認為自己應該終止那場比賽
...Frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight...

838
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,030
可以挽救我的眼睛
...should've saved my eye.

839
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:30,370
他一生都希望能收回那第109場比賽
Spends his life wishing he could take back that 109th fight.

840
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,140
但我卻想參加第110場
I wanted to go to 110.

841
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,740
重點是
Thing is...

842
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,210
如果你想取得冠軍
...if you wanna get to the title...

843
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,210
也許他并不是最好人選
...maybe he's not the one to take you there.

844
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,550
你告訴了麥克先生我們今晚會來這里？
You tell Mr.Mack we'd be here tonight?

845
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,960
繼續吃你的蛋糕吧
You go on, eat your cupcake.

846
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:58,860
不用了，我來吧
No, I got it.

847
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,810
這就是規矩
It's the rule.

848
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,380
隨時保護自己
Always protect yourself.

849
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,780
人們從不采納自己的意見
People never take their own advice.

850
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:16,980
如果她要離開弗蘭基 最好當時就做
If she was gonna leave Frankie, better she did it to him then.

851
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,290
米奇 麥克先生？
Mr.Mickey Mack?

852
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,790
我是麥琪 菲斯杰拉德
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

853
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:31,830
我聽說你是非常好的經理人 給大個子威利做的很不錯
I hear you're a real good manager, doing good things for Big Willie.

854
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,330
但我想你該知道 我是不會離開鄧先生的
But I thought you should know I ain't never leaving Mr.Dunn...

855
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,260
所以你不需要再找借口好遇見我了
...so you don't need to make any more excuses to bump into me.

856
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,710
不好意思打攪你吃飯了
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

857
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:51,610
麥琪總是喜歡剛一交手 就把對手擊倒
Maggie always did like taking them out in the first round.

858
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:28,660
寄出的信總是原樣退回:
The letters always came back marked the same way:

859
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:31,020
上面寫著“退還發件人”
"Return to sender."

860
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,080
我給你準備點咖啡
I'll make you some coffee.

861
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,720
你打算拿你的錢干些什么？
What are you doing with your money?

862
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,420
- 存起來    - 好孩子
- Saving it.    - Good girl.

863
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,670
你知道，如果存夠了就可以買座小房
You know, you save enough of it, you ought to get yourself a little house.

864
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,170
現金，不用貸款
Cash, no mortgage.

865
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,900
那還要存一段時間
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

866
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:25,240
是啊，可能還有一段時間...
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

867
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,040
...但你得給自己弄個窩
...but you gotta get yourself a place of your own.

868
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,450
把錢浪費在無關緊要的東西上 你能得到什么？
Go around wasting it on things that don't matter and what do you got?

869
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,320
明白么？
You understand?

870
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,390
很快，如果你等得太久 你什么也得不到
Pretty soon, you wait long enough, you got nothing.

871
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,550
好吧，只要我存夠錢
Okay, soon as I get the money.

872
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:43,790
我這一生中犯了很多錯誤 我只是不想你走一樣的路
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just trying to keep you from doing the same.

873
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:45,890
知道了，老板
I know, boss.

874
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,670
- 我不會長命百歲的    - 這是什么？
- I'm not gonna live forever.    - What is it?

875
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,500
一盒關于你那個英國對手的錄像帶
It's a tape on that girl in England you're gonna fight.

876
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,010
如果你想去爭奪冠軍 我們得做-- 嘿！
If you're gonna go for the title, we got some moves to... Hey.

877
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:58,840
嘿，快他媽下來 知道我有多大歲數么？
Hey, get the hell down. You know how old I am?

878
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,640
- 謝謝老板，非常感謝    - 嗯
- Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.    - Yeah.

879
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,260
不用謝，親愛的 給，把--我把這個放到機器里去
You're welcome, darling. Here, just... Here, let me put this in the machine.

880
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,450
什么機器？
What machine?

881
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,620
你沒有電視，是么？
Don't have a TV, huh?

882
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,560
沒有
No.

883
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,990
耶！
Yeah!

884
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,190
好了，好的
All right. Okay.

885
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,770
- 還有十分鐘，親愛的    - 謝謝
- Ten minutes, love.    - Thank you.

886
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,510
那家伙說他愛我
Man says he loves me.

887
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,770
他不可能是第一個這么說的男人
He's probably not the first one to say that.

888
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,180
除了我爸以外的第一個
First since my daddy.

889
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,480
我要是贏了，你說他會向我求婚么？
I win, you think he'll propose?

890
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,980
你贏了，我就向你求婚
You win, I'll propose.

891
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,730
看，我給你帶了件禮物
Look, I got you a gift here.

892
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:50,760
我想這是其他人的吧
I think they gave you somebody else's.

893
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,900
不，不，就是這個
No, no, this is it.

894
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,400
“莫 庫什勒”是什么意思？
What's it mean?

895
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,410
不知道，是高盧語
I don't know. Just something in Gaelic.

896
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,040
- 真漂亮    - 嗯，我也這么認為
- It's beautiful.    - Yeah, I thought so.

897
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,040
- 是啊    - 真絲的
- Yeah.    - Real silk thread.

898
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:13,990
來自美國的挑戰者...
From the United States of America, the challenger...

899
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,490
...麥琪 菲斯杰拉德
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

900
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,360
“莫 庫什勒” 你看到她袍子上的字了嗎？
Mo cuishle. Did you see what was on her robe?

901
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,800
- “莫 庫什勒”，“莫 庫什勒”    - “莫 庫什勒”
- Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.    - Mo cuishle.

902
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,870
她本不是本晚的賣點
She wasn 't the main attraction.

903
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,700
她的比賽是一場中量級拳王賽的墊場賽
She was on the undercard of a middleweight title fight.

904
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,070
但如果你問問在場的人...
But ask someone who was there...

905
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,240
...他們都不記得 當晚參加比賽的其他選手了
...they couldn 't tell you who else fought that night.

906
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,050
開始
Box.

907
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,100
- 加油！    -“莫 庫什勒”！
- Come on!    - Mo cuishle!

908
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:13,980
“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

909
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,810
“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle!

910
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,210
“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle!

911
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:24,080
“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

912
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,600
她很強
She's tough.

913
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,740
我無法靠近 我無法靠近打到她
I can't get inside. I can't get close enough to hit her.

914
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,380
- 你知道為什么嗎？    - 為什么？
- You know why that is?    - Why?

915
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,750
因為她是個比你更好的拳手
She's a better fighter than you are.

916
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:48,010
她更年輕，更強壯 更有經驗
She's younger, she's stronger, and she's more experienced. Now...

917
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,380
現在你打算怎么辦？
...what are you gonna do about it?

918
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,190
去吧
Get in there.

919
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,490
開始
Box.

920
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:20,910
三，四，五，六..
Three, four, five, six...

921
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:26,250
...七，八，九，十
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

922
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,520
“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

923
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:41,000
- “莫 庫什勒”！    - “莫 庫什勒”！
- Mo cuishle!    - Mo cuishle!

924
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,340
你知道我可以問其他人，對嗎？
I could ask someone, you know?

925
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,240
好啊
Good.

926
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,440
你知道以后告訴我
You find out, you let me know.

927
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:04,460
不管那個名字是什么意思 人們記住了
Whatever it meant, the name stuck.

928
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:09,190
麥琪打遍愛丁堡，巴黎，布魯塞爾 和阿姆斯特丹
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

929
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:12,200
觀眾總是高呼“莫 庫什勒”
It was always mo cuishle.

930
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,770
看起來到處是愛爾蘭人...
Seems there are Irish people everywhere...

931
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,270
...或者是想成為愛爾蘭人的人
...or people who wanna be.

932
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,160
當他們回到美國的時候...
By the time they came back to the States...

933
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:24,100
...麥琪已經達到了一個新的水平
...Maggie was in a whole new league.

934
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:45,690
“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

935
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,710
后來他們受到另一場冠軍賽的邀請
After that they got another offer to fight for the title.

936
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,950
怎么分成？
What's the split?

937
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,950
- 六四開    - 好
- Sixty-forty.    - Good.

938
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,080
好，我們六，你們四 因為麥琪是吸引觀眾的籌碼
We'll take 60 and you take 40, being as that Maggie's the draw.

939
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:11,990
那個小女孩
That little girl?

940
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,730
你真的認為我說的不對？ 你認為觀眾會說...
You think I'm wrong, really? You think people are saying...

941
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,700
...他們想看一個破爛德國人 痛揍無名氏小姐？
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

942
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:22,930
你要能找到那樣的人，我們就拿四
You find someone who says that, and we'll take the 40.

943
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,170
給你
There you go.

944
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,880
他們現在是六四開 不過最后會是五五開
They're at 60-40, but they'll come up to 50-50.

945
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,380
那女孩現在怎么樣了？
How's that girl doing?

946
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,690
她腦震蕩了，耳鼓膜破裂
Well, she's got a concussion and a broken eardrum.

947
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,800
她沒事吧
She be all right?

948
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:50,860
- 她要是有事呢？    - 也許我應該給她送點什么
- And if she isn't?    - Maybe I should send her something.

949
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,200
你愿意的話，把你的獎金寄給她好了 我想她會接受
Well, you could send her your check if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

950
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,970
老板？
Boss?

951
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,010
我們說起過的那座房子？
That little house we talked about?

952
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,840
我買下了
I bought it.

953
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,880
聰明的姑娘
Well, smart girl.

954
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,350
給我媽買的 離她現在住的地方不到一英里
For my mama. It's only about a mile from where she lives now.

955
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,650
如你所言，沒有貸款
No mortgage, just like you said.

956
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,990
你是個好女兒
You're a good daughter.

957
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:22,720
她還不知道
She don't know about it yet.

958
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,430
我希望我們可以多待一天 開車到那里去
I was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day, drive over there?

959
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,540
我知道她想見你
I know she wants to meet you.

960
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,730
好吧，可以
Yeah, we could do that.

961
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,960
哦，天哪，媽媽快出來
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

962
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,330
麥琪回來了
Mary M's here.

963
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,440
- 這是約翰遜家的舊屋    - 不再是了
- This is the Johnsons' old house.    - Not anymore.

964
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,990
它是你的了，媽媽 還有瑪代爾和孩子們
It's all yours, Mama. For you and Mardell and the kids.

965
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,960
- 麥琪，這房子是你給我買的？    - 對，是你的了，全部付清了
- Mary M, you bought this for me?    - Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

966
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,830
親愛的
Darling...

967
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,330
沒冰箱，也沒爐灶
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

968
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,800
在你們搬進來前，會準備好的
They'll be here before you move in.

969
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,440
- 你花了多少錢？    - 你不用管
- How much money did this cost you?    - Never mind that.

970
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,300
- 你不該這么做    - 您需要一個體面的住處
- You shouldn't have done this.    - You need a decent place.

971
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,780
你不該這么做 你該先問問我的
You shouldn't have done it. You should've asked me first.

972
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:50,380
如果政府發現了 他們會停掉我的社會福利的
Government's gonna find out about this, they're gonna stop my welfare.

973
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,390
- 媽媽，他們不會的    - 他們會的，你很好，有自己的工作
- Mama, no, they ain't.    - They are. You're fine, you're working...

974
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,420
但沒有福利我活不下去
...but I can't live without my welfare.

975
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,250
媽媽我會給你寄錢的
Mama, I'll send you money.

976
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:01,830
醫療怎么辦？ 公費醫療會把我從名單上劃掉
What about my medicine? Medicaid gonna cut me off.

977
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,630
- 我拿什么錢買藥啊？    - 我會給你寄更多的錢
- How am I supposed to get my medicine?    - I'll send you more money.

978
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:08,230
我希望你沒有預期JD要住進來
I hope you don't expect J.D. To move in with us.

979
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,670
你知道他快出獄了
He's getting out, you know.

980
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,870
為什么不把錢直接給我？
Why didn't you just give me the money?

981
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,500
為什么必須給我買房子？
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

982
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:22,240
不是必須，媽媽，但房子是你的了
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

983
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,580
如果想要錢，把它賣掉好了
You want the money, sell it.

984
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,750
我不--
I don't...

985
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,200
我知道你不想傷害我們...
I know you didn't mean nothing hurtful...

986
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,770
...只是有時候你沒把事情想清楚
...but sometimes you just don't think things through.

987
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,470
- 這倒是真的，媽媽    - 我會試著不把房子賣掉
- That's true, Mama.    - I'll try and keep the house.

988
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,310
我只是擔心養房子的那些費用
I'm just worried about all those expenses.

989
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,380
我會給你寄更多錢的
I'll send you some more money.

990
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,790
那個人把你打成這樣的？
That man hitting you?

991
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,490
這是比賽留下的
It's from the fight.

992
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,420
我是一名拳擊手，媽媽
I'm a fighter, Mama.

993
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,270
找個老公吧，麥琪
Find a man, Mary M.

994
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,100
過正常的生活
Live proper.

995
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:17,260
人們知道你的職業后就會嘲笑你
People hear about what you're doing and they laugh.

996
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,500
告訴你我很難過，但是他們嘲笑你
Hurts me to tell you, but they laugh at you.

997
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:13,990
嗨
Hi.

998
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,420
你養過狗么？
You ever own a dog?

999
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,120
沒有
Nope.

1000
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:52,890
我差點養了一只巴斯頓的中型狗
Closest I ever came was a middleweight from Barstow.

1001
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:59,300
我爸養過一只德國牧羊犬，埃克斯
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1002
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,170
埃克斯的后腿不太好
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1003
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,940
它得用自己的前腿拖著自己 從一個房間走到另一個房間
...he had to drag himself room to room by his front legs.

1004
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:08,080
看他跑過廚房的地板
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1005
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:12,080
我和瑪代爾都會忍不住大笑
...watching him scoot across the kitchen floor.

1006
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:16,350
爸爸，他當時病的很重 自己都站不起來
Daddy, he was so sick by then, he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1007
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,280
但一天早上他起床以后 把埃克斯抱到他的拖車上
But one morning he got up, carried Axel to his rig...

1008
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:25,860
他們倆跑進樹林里 又唱又叫
...and the two of them went off into the woods, singing and howling.

1009
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:30,090
直到那天晚上他獨自回來時
But it wasn't till he got home that night alone that I saw...

1010
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,900
我才發現卡車里的鏟子
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1011
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,640
好想再看看他們倆在一起的樣子
Sure miss watching the two of them together.

1012
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:52,110
我現在除了你誰都沒有了，弗蘭基
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1013
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:57,260
對，你還有我
Well, you've got me.

1014
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:03,900
至少在你找到一個好經理人以前是這樣
At least, that is, until we find you a good manager.

1015
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,810
嘿，我們能在這停一下么？
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1016
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,880
好
Yeah.

1017
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,350
這里有附近最好的檸檬派
This place has the best lemon pie around.

1018
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,460
沒有那種惡心的罐裝餡
None of that canned-filling crap.

1019
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,700
現在我可以上天堂了
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1020
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,550
我以前和爸爸常來這
I used to come here with Daddy.

1021
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,240
我不知道象這樣的地方會不會出售
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1022
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,940
我還有點積蓄
I got a little bit of savings.

1023
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,530
（艾記小吃店）

1024
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:04,520
好，好，謝謝
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1025
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:11,330
嘿，丹吉爾到底在看什么？
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1026
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,400
好像是另外一瓶水
Looks like another bottle of water.

1027
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:16,910
想和我們一起到拉斯維加斯去么？
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1028
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:22,040
看你們在老虎機那兒受罪？ 我的心臟受不了那種刺激
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots? My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1029
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:25,810
呃，她有場冠軍賽，對手是“蘭熊”
Well, she's got a title shot. The Blue Bear.

1030
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:28,010
百萬美金對半分
Million dollars, split right down the center.

1031
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,980
啊，不錯啊，弗蘭基，很不錯
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1032
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,750
我想找個好助手一起去
Well, I could use a good second.

1033
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,690
但是找不到 所以我來問問你
Can't find one, I thought I'd ask you.

1034
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,950
哦，我他媽為什么會同意呢？
Now, why the hell would I wanna do that?

1035
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,560
因為你是一個 從來沒得過冠軍的半瞎的老傻瓜
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool who never got there himself.

1036
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,460
我想你可能想去體驗一下 站在冠軍賽的繩圈里的感覺
I thought you might like to feel what it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1037
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,630
不好意思，我替你遺憾了
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1038
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,270
我不去，你還是在拉斯維加斯找吧
No, you pick up somebody there in Vegas.

1039
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,510
找個年輕點的
Somebody with young hands.

1040
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,740
你不會哭吧？ 我已經帶上一個女孩了
You're not gonna cry now, are you? I've already got one girl.

1041
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,420
如果我離開這地方一天...
I leave this place for one day...

1042
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:03,420
...知道回來時這里會變成什么樣么？
...got any idea what it would look like when I come back?

1043
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,420
和現在這樣差不多吧
Kind of like it looks right now.

1044
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,020
噢，去死吧
Oh, go to hell.

1045
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:11,920
告訴麥琪沒有拳王腰帶不要回來
You tell Maggie don't come back here without a belt.

1046
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,890
知道了
Will do.

1047
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,940
嘿，斯科雷普先生
Hey, Mr.Scrap.

1048
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:23,400
我有個問題 可是我覺得問出來好傻
I got a question, but I feel real stupid asking it.

1049
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,810
在這里沒有問題是愚蠢的，丹吉爾
No such thing as a stupid question there, Danger.

1050
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,780
好吧
Okay.

1051
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:34,110
你怎么把冰塊從這么小的口里放進去的？
How'd you get all the ice in here through this little tiny hole?

1052
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,350
我一直在想
I've been thinking on it.

1053
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,280
但想不出來
Can't figure it out.

1054
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,080
我來做給你看吧，丹吉爾
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1055
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,630
- 你可以，你可以做給我看？    - 我想可以，我想可以
- You could do that? You could show me?    - I think so. I think so.

1056
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,820
還有，斯科雷普先生 我有點覺得我準備好參加比賽了
Also, Mr.Scrap, I was kind of thinking I might be ready for a fight.

1057
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,130
我拿了票，你準備好了么？
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1058
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,210
- 我們坐飛機去？    - 你寧愿開車？
- We're flying?    - Would you rather drive?

1059
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,310
你是問我嗎？
You're asking me?

1060
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:04,710
你是想坐飛機還是開車過去？
Would you rather fly, or would you rather drive?

1061
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:07,650
我終于有權決定某些事了么？
So I finally get to decide something?

1062
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,220
我說的就是這個意思
That's what I'm saying.

1063
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,980
好吧
Fine.

1064
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,890
好，飛過去，開車回來
Fly there, drive back.

1065
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,920
這是我聽過的最愚蠢的事 我們怎么會那么做？
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. How the hell we gonna do that?

1066
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:18,860
你說過讓我決定的
You said it was up to me.

1067
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,270
丹吉爾，給他們點顏色
Give them hell there, Danger.

1068
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,470
嘿，老家伙，馬桶的水溢出來了
Hey, old school, the toilet's overflowing.

1069
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,620
嘿，冒失鬼，過來一下
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1070
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,350
我的天啊
Jesus.

1071
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,220
老天爺
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1072
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,820
噢，上帝！
Oh, God!

1073
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,530
蠢豬
Dumb-ass.

1074
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,370
來呀，丹吉爾 來呀，丹吉爾

來呀，防守

1076
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:03,870
本來我可以坐在海市蜃樓酒店里...

1077
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,580
...喝著邁泰酒...

1078
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:08,940
...看著裸體女人
...Iooking at naked women.

1079
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:12,380
來呀，丹吉爾 舉起手來打呀
Come on, Danger, put up your hands and fight.

1080
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:17,020
丹吉爾，出去吧！
Danger, get out of there!

1081
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,230
反擊啊，快點
Fight back! Come on!

1082
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,030
- 對了，丹吉爾，對了！    - 干得好，哥們兒
- There you go, Danger, there you go!    - Good job, man.

- What you doing? Let him go.    - All right. Okay.

1087
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,120
我扶住你了，來，來
I got you. Come on, come on.

1088
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:51,250
沒事了
It's all right.

1089
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:54,260
我們不需要教練
We don't need no corner trainer.

1090
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:55,790
我怎么樣，斯科雷普先生！
How'd I do, Mr.Scrap?

你還沒打出氣勢呢

每個人都可能輸的

好了
All right.

1103
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:30,320
喂，別摘手套啊，哥們兒 你還沒用過呢，丹吉爾
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man. You ain't even used them, Danger.

1104
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,490
能借用一下么，丹吉爾？
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1105
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,470
小子，你是不是叫丹吉爾啊？
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1106

Call ESPN, because you can't write this shit.

1132
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,930
- 一個右勾拳打中了冠軍    - 好的
- And a right hook stuns the champ.    - All right.

1133
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:39,270
分開！
Break it up!

1134
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,220
分開！分開！
Break it! Break it!

1135
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:53,120
再這么干的話，就扣你一分 明白了嗎？
Do that one more time, it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1136
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:56,590
去打吧
Go fight.

1137
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,400
你他媽的混蛋
You motherfucker.

1138
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:17,010
靠，這他媽算什么？
Come on. What the fuck?

1139
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,910
好了，不能再這樣了 我要扣你一分
All right, that's it. I'm gonna take away a point.

1140

--反擊了，打中了菲斯杰拉德....
- Comes back, hits Fitzgerald...

1142
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:27,120
裁判，眼睛睜大點，你....
Ref, open your eyes, you...

1143
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:48,870
女士們先生們 冠軍賽的第一回合結束了
Ladies and gentlemen, the first round is in the books on this championship match.

1144
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:54,780
- 拿住    - 好的
- Hold onto that.    - There you go.

1145
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,920
- 看起來不錯    - 你再使那種陰招...
- Looking good.    - You pull that crap one more time...

1146
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,860
...我就取消你的比賽資格
...you're disqualified.

1147
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,700
沒事的
It's gonna be all right.

1148
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:15,600
毫不懷疑，老板
Got no doubt, boss.

1149
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,040
好，照看好你自己
Okay, just watch yourself.

1150
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:22,610
離這位夫人遠點
Stay away from this dame.

1151
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:37,790
去中立角，中立角
Go to the neutral corner. Neutral corner.

1152
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,130
- 四，五，六...    - 趴著吧，你個婊子
- Four, five, six...    - Stay down, you bitch.

1153
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,700
...七，八，九
...seven, eight, nine.

1154
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,120
好啊，好啊！
Yeah, yeah!

1155
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:03,280
分開，分開
Break it! Break it!

1156
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,030
菲斯杰拉德連續擊打藍熊 東德的冠軍....
Fitzgerald continues to pummel The Blue Bear. The East German champion...

1157
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:29,510
好！加油！
Yes! Come on!

1158
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,250
我來，我來！
I got it! I got it.

1159
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,390
眼睛有點模糊，老板
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1160
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,320
- 你需要幾只眼完成比賽？    - 一只足夠了
- How many eyes you need to finish this?    - One's enough.

1161
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,390
- 好    - 那么...
- Good.    - Now...

1162
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:49,090
...我怎么對付這只熊？
...what do I do about the Bear?

1163
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:52,200
你知道繞到外側 擊打肝臟部位的套路嗎？
Do you know that step into the outside and hook into the liver?

1164
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:55,970
- 我一直都這么打的，可她是銅頭鐵臂    - 我不要你打肝臟的部位
- I been doing that. She's made of steel.    - I don't want you to go to the liver.

1165
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:59,080
我要你照準 她的小屁股下面打，明白嗎？
I want you to hit her right up under her skinny ass, understand?

1166
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:02,300
照準坐骨神經打 不停的打那個部位
Right in the sciatic nerve. Just keep digging it in there.

1167
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,570
而且要一直纏著她 你聽到了么？
And just keep sticking her. You hear that?

1168
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,710
- 裁判員怎么辦？    - 站在裁判和“熊”的中間...
- What about the ref?    - Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1169
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:09,650
...就沒問題了
...and everything will just be fine.

1170
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,690
比賽是你的，提高警惕
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1171
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,420
保持注意力
You keep it up.

1172
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:30,370
噢，好啊！
Oh, yeah!

1173
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:43,010
分開，分開！
Break, break!

1174
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:53,490
“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！“莫 庫什勒”！
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1175
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,760
醫生
Doctor.

1176
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:40,770
來呀
Come on.

1177
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:42,670
呼吸
Breathe.

1178
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:45,410
很好，呼吸
That's it. Breathe.

1179
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,510
很好
Good.

1180
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:49,210
看著我，注意看我
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1181
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,220
呼吸
Breathe.

1182
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,410
很好
Good.

1183
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,220
就這樣
That's it.

1184
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,820
呼吸
Breathe.

1185
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:48,070
親愛的，感覺怎樣？
How you feeling, darling?

1186
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:58,890
留胡子啦，老板
Growing a beard, boss?

1187
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:02,560
我想可能會增加我的女人緣
I thought it might help me with the ladies.

1188
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,760
很難說哦
Can't say it does.

1189
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,520
會不--會不會很疼？
Does it...? Does it hurt much?

1190
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,520
一點也不
Don't hurt at all.

1191
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,090
那很好
Well, that's good.

1192
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:51,370
弗蘭基呢？
Where's Frankie?

1193
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:54,910
他在....
Well, he's...

1194
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,480
他在外面和醫生談
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1195
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,740
可能在教他們怎樣做好本職工作
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1196
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:07,360
他們在告訴他 我是C1和C2頸椎完全損傷
They're telling him I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1197
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:15,290
就是說我的脊椎斷得很徹底 完全沒法修復了
Means that my spinal cord's so broke they'll never be able to fix it.

1198
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:22,530
我下半生都得這么躺著
Gonna be frozen like this the rest of my life.

1199
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:31,410
我叫他們告訴他 我不知道他能不能接受的了
I asked them to tell him. I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1200
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,850
你看了比賽么？
Did you see the fight?

1201
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:46,120
當然
Of course I did.

1202
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:49,100
你完全壓倒了她，麥琪
You had her cold, Maggie.

1203
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:53,690
我不應該把手放下去的
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1204
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,740
我不該轉身的
I shouldn't have turned.

1205
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,580
隨時保護我自己
Always protect myself.

1206
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,880
這句話他和我說了多少遍了
How many times he tell me that?

1207
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,490
是啊...
Yeah...

1208
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:17,720
...他說話總是喜歡一遍遍重復
...he does like to repeat himself.

1209
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,830
你能告訴他我很抱歉嗎？
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1210
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,340
不能
No.

1211
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,310
不，我不會這么做的，麥琪
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1212
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:55,020
真是該死啊
Damnedest thing.

1213
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,630
你有什么計劃？
So, what's the plan?

1214
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:04,800
我知道你已經計劃好了 你還是告訴我的好
I know you got one, so you might as well tell me what it is.

1215
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,740
是你的錯
It's your fault.

1216
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:10,340
對，她現在那樣躺著 都是你的錯
Yeah, it's your fault she's lying in there like that.

1217
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,480
你纏著我讓我訓練她
You kept after me until I trained her.

1218
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,890
我知道我不該這么做的 她再怎么說也是個女孩
I knew I shouldn't have done it, her being a girl and all.

1219
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,390
其他的一切也不斷向我顯示 不要訓練她
Everything kept telling me not to.

1220
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,320
除了你
Everything but you.

1221
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:33,430
我要把你從這兒弄出去
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1222
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,570
這里的醫生屁都不懂
These doctors around here don't know squat.

1223
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:38,710
要不然他們為什么要在沙漠里住著？
Otherwise, why would they be living out here in the desert?

1224
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,840
一旦你能被移動了...
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1225
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:45,780
...我會找個地方 有人真正學過醫的地方
...we'll find some place where they've actually studied medicine.

1226
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:50,620
你就在那里修養好了，我會....
You just rest there, I'II...

1227
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,020
我正在辦
I'm on it.

1228
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,500
弗蘭基肯定打遍了全美國醫院的電話...
Frankie must have called every hospital in America...

1229
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:08,470
...尋找能告訴他 她可以被治好的人
...Iooking for somebody who'd tell him they could fix her.

1230
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,700
有兩次很接近成功 可他們給她做了徹底檢查后...
He came close twice, till they checked her over...

1231
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,010
...也表示無能為力
...said there was nothing to be done.

1232
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:18,740
兩個月后 她病情穩定到可以被移動了
Took two months till she was stable enough to move.

1233
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,550
他們有護士專門做這個，你知道的
They got nurses for that, you know.

1234
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:30,260
嗯，可她們太業余了
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1235
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:46,710
因為不能移動，她長了褥瘡
She developed skin ulcers because she couldn't change positions.

1236
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,350
謝謝你
Thank you.

1237
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,670
他們坐著救護車 完成了六個小時的旅程
They made the six-hour trip by ambulance.

1238
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:26,920
飛過去，開車回來
Fly there, drive back.

1239
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:36,720
弗蘭基找到的康復中心 是個不錯的地方
The rehab center Frankie found was a nice place.

1240
01:39:37,190 --> 01:39:38,990
他們把麥琪照顧地很周到
They took good care of Maggie.

1241
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,260
即使他們沒有的話 她也不會抱怨什么
She wouldn 't have complained if they hadn 't.

1242
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:46,490
每天要花幾小時才能讓她上輪椅
Took several hours every day to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1243
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:54,010
一，二，三，起
One, two, three, up.

1244
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:58,750
由于她無法自主呼吸
Since she couldn't breathe on her own...

1245
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,540
呼吸器總是開著
...her respirators were always on.

1246
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:06,620
氧氣24小時不間斷地 被輸進她的身體里
Oxygen was pumped into her 24 hours a day.

1247
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:36,180
麥琪的媽媽打電話來說 他們會來看她
Maggie's mama called to say they were all coming for a visit.

1248
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:39,980
在接下來的兩周里 她每天都在窗前等他們
She waited by the window every day for the next two weeks.

1249
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,260
當然
Sure.

1250
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:45,020
弗蘭基最后終于追蹤到了他們
Frankie finally tracked them down.

1251
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:49,190
發現他們六天前就住進旅館了
Learned they'd checked into their hotel six days earlier.

1252
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:52,730
弗蘭基一直給他們留言 但總沒有回音
Kept leaving messages which were never returned.

1253
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,500
你不用整天都待在這兒
You don't have to hang around all day.

1254
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:06,310
我喜歡這里，沒關系的
I like it here. I don't mind.

1255
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:11,010
其實就算你不在，我也會來讀書的
In fact, if you weren't here, I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1256
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:16,860
媽媽馬上會來分擔一些負擔的
Mama will be here soon to share some of the burden.

1257
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:19,030
哦，這不是什么負擔
Well, it's no burden.

1258
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,400
給
Here.

1259
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:24,730
讀讀這個
Read this.

1260
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,970
好了，好了，行了
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1261
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:37,910
讀得太糟糕了
That's terrible.

1262
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:43,410
我給你翻成英文吧
Anyway, I'll tell you in English what you were saying.

1263
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,790
上面說：
It says:

1264
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,520
“我要起身去了，去往那茵湖島”
I will arise and go now And go to Innisfree

1265
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:56,220
“用泥土和樹枝，蓋上一間小木房”
And a small cabin build there Of clay and wattles made

1266
01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:01,540
“我享受著彼方的寧靜，它緩緩滴零”
And I shall have some peace there For peace comes dropping slow

1267
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:06,840
“從晨曦的面紗，到蟋蟀歌唱的地方”
Dropping from the veils of the morning To where the cricket sings.

1268
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:10,610
還不賴，對吧？
Not bad, huh?

1269
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:17,280
你要蓋一間小木屋么，老板？
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1270
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,790
- 我？    - 對
- Me?    - Yeah.

1271
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,890
你知道，等你收山之后
You know, when you quit all this.

1272
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,490
你是說拳擊？
You mean boxing?

1273
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:31,690
不，我永遠不會收山的
No, I'll never quit.

1274
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:35,190
我太喜歡那汗臭味道了，我想
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1275
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,600
你想？我看你邊看書...
You think? Because I could see you there real easy...

1276
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:46,150
...邊吃檸檬派很愜意呀
...with your books and lemon pie.

1277
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,220
你呢？想在小木屋里生活么？
How about you? Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1278
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,520
我可以學怎么烤東西
I could learn how to bake.

1279
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,990
那樣的話，我....
Well, then, I'II...

1280
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:03,330
我也許要開始找了
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1281
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,550
是啊
Yeah.

1282
01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:31,730
- 去吧    - 好的，聽起來不錯
- Go ahead.    - All right. Okay, sounds good.

1283
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:38,030
嘿，我是弗蘭基 鄧 我們在密蘇里見過
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn. I met you back out in Missouri.

1284
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,500
我女兒在哪？
Where's my little girl?

1285
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:42,500
你們不應該回旅館換身衣服再來嗎？
Don't you think you ought to go back to the hotel and change?

1286
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,440
她還不知道你們已經來了一周 忙著拜訪米老鼠呢
She doesn't know you've been here a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1287
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:49,070
我們和我妹妹有正事談 你干嗎不干脆告訴我們她在哪呢？
We got business with my sister. Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1288
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:52,010
你肯定是JD 那你肯定是那個談正經事的家伙？
Oh, you must be J.D. And you must be the business guy?

1289
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:53,580
你們錯過了一些東西
There's some rides you missed.

1290
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,410
你們不如回去 我來告訴她你們來不成了
Why don't you go back. I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1291
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:58,850
我開了這么遠的路來照顧孩子
I drove all the way here to take care of my child.

1292
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:01,180
你卻暗示我不是個好母親？
And you're suggesting I'm not a good mother?

1293
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,020
麥琪哪里都去不了
Mary M. Can't go nowhere.

1294
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:06,160
否則我們早帶她去逛迪斯尼樂園了
If we could've taken her to Disneyland, we would've.

1295
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,890
麥琪 菲斯杰拉德?
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1296
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:11,060
就在這里，301房間
Right down here, 301.

1297
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,060
- 快來，媽媽    - 我們走
- Come on, Mama.    - Let's go.

1298
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,670
后來我看到自己呼吸
And I saw myself breathing.

1299
01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:23,710
我的身體上下起伏
Like, my body was going up and down.

1300
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,710
我想，“為什么沒人告訴我？”
I thought, "Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1301
01:44:30,190 --> 01:44:33,050
你的頭發得洗了 有點太油了
Your hair needs washing. It's kind of greasy.

1302
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:48,500
只是些....
It's just a...

1303
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:51,600
只是些法律上的程序
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1304
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:53,110
是什么？
What is it?

1305
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,340
你們談得怎樣了？
How we all doing here?

1306
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:58,040
不好意思，親愛的 我們時間不多
Sorry, darling, but we ain't got a lot of time.

1307
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:02,380
約翰遜先生收了我們一大筆錢 來保證這件事不出紕漏
Mr.Johnson's charging us a lot of money to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1308
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:05,180
你們不如把那個留下 我等會兒讀給她聽
Why don't you just leave that. I'll read it to her later.

1309
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,910
嘿，老家伙
Hey, old man...

1310
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:08,560
你是我們家人么？
...you part of our family?

1311
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:11,150
別管閑事
Stay the hell out of this.

1312
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,490
念給我聽，媽媽
Read it to me, Mama.

1313
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:18,230
只是些法律程序 用來保護你的錢的
Well, it's just something legal to protect your money.

1314
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,530
媽媽你不用擔心
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1315
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:24,810
拳擊協會會支付這里所有的費用的
The boxing commission's paying for all this, everything.

1316
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:27,300
如果不呢，麥琪？
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1317
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:30,310
約翰遜先生說他們可以收走我的房子
Mr.Johnson says they can take my house.

1318
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,640
如果你把財產轉移給你母親 那就沒人能動得了了
If you assign your assets to your mother, no one can touch them.

1319
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,650
不用管醫生，喪葬費什么的
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1320
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:39,450
- 什么都不用理會了    - 你看，不如你們把這個留下
- Nothing.    - Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1321
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:43,490
- 我以后再讀給她--    - 無意冒犯，這不關你的事
- Then I'll just read it to her later on...    - With respect, this ain't your business.

1322
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,400
好吧，我在走廊里等
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1323
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,000
你一直是個好女兒，麥琪
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1324
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:59,370
你簽了這份文件
You sign that paper...

1325
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:01,870
就能照顧你一家
...it'll take care of your family...

1326
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,410
正如你父親所愿
...the way your daddy would've wanted you to.

1327
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:11,180
嗯，你怎么簽字呢？
How do you make your mark?

1328
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,920
能拿住筆么？
Can you hold a pen?

1329
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:17,460
她只能用牙齒，媽媽
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1330
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:19,690
你得把筆放到她嘴里去
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1331
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,790
好了，親愛的
Here you go, honey.

1332
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:28,000
你看了那場比賽么，媽媽？
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1333
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:30,430
親愛的 你知道我對那東西是什么感覺
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1334
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,570
我打得不錯
I did pretty good.

1335
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:35,610
你輸了，麥琪
You lost, Mary M.

1336
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:40,240
聽說不是你的錯，但你輸了
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it, but you lost.

1337
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:44,620
不能把你現在剩下的東西也輸掉
Don't wanna lose the rest of what you got left.

1338
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,610
對了
There you go.

1339
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:57,830
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

1340
01:46:58,170 --> 01:46:59,860
這是什么意思？
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1341
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:05,140
媽媽，你帶上瑪代爾和JD回家吧
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D. And get home.

1342
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:10,310
別等我告訴律師 你擔心領不到社會福利...
Before I tell that lawyer that you were so worried about your welfare...

1343
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:13,710
...所以根本就沒按規定 簽那些房產的證明
...you never signed those house papers like you were supposed to.

1344
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:18,950
所以只要我愿意 我可以把房子賣了...
So any time I feel like it, I can sell that house...

1345
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:22,350
...不用理你這個又肥又懶的鄉巴佬
...from under your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.

1346
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:27,730
如果你敢再來，我就那么做
And if you ever come back, that's exactly what I'll do.

1347
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:13,170
也許應該有人數點到10
Well, maybe someone ought to count to 10.

1348
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,850
不是很好聞吧，醫生？
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1349
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,390
可能保不住了，麥琪
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1350
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:53,240
他們拿掉了我的腿，老板
They took my leg, boss.

1351
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:00,580
不會有事的，聽到嗎？
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1352
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:04,820
我總能聽到你的聲音，老板
I always hear your voice, boss.

1353
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:38,110
需要什么嗎？
You need anything?

1354
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:44,520
我想知道“莫 庫什勒”的意思
I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.

1355
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,060
可是你沒有贏啊
But you didn't win.

1356
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:50,570
我不用告訴你的
I don't have to tell you.

1357
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,860
你是我見過的最壞的人
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1358
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,340
難怪沒有人愛你
No wonder no one loves you.

1359
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:05,310
你讓我想起了我父親
You remind me of my daddy.

1360
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:09,990
他肯定是個...
Well, he must have been...

1361
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:13,790
...非常聰明，英俊的人
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1362
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:20,790
你不會再讓我讀葉芝了，對吧？
You ain't gonna make me talk no more Yeats, are you?

1363
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,130
不，我...
No, I was...

1364
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,540
...正在看城市大學的宣傳材料
...Iooking at this catalog from City College.

1365
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,170
我想給你弄個輪椅...
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1366
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:37,050
...可以用吸管控制的那種
...maybe the kind that operates by blowing through a straw.

1367
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:40,820
我想你可能想去上學
I thought maybe you'd like to go back to school.

1368
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:48,290
求你幫個忙，老板
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1369
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:52,260
沒問題
Sure.

1370
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:55,620
什么事都行
Anything you want.

1371
01:51:57,330 --> 01:52:00,300
記得我爸是怎么幫埃克斯的么？
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1372
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:15,650
想都不要想
Don't even think about that.

1373
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,960
我不能象現在這樣，弗蘭基
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1374
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:26,960
在我已經成就那么多以后
Not after what I done.

1375
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:29,120
我見識了整個世界
I seen the world.

1376
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,400
人們高呼我的名字
People chanted my name.

1377
01:52:35,410 --> 01:52:36,570
喔...
Well...

1378
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:42,000
...不是我的本名 是你給我起的該死的名字
...not my name, some damn name you gave me.

1379
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:47,480
可他們為我歡呼
But they were chanting for me.

1380
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,390
我上過雜志
I was in magazines.

1381
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,920
你以為我以前做過這樣的夢么？
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1382
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:08,000
我生出來的時候只有2磅1.5盎司
I was born at 2 pounds, 1 and a half ounces.

1383
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:15,040
爸爸以前總說我是打拼 到這個世界上的...
Daddy used to tell me I fought to get into this world...

1384
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,750
...我也會打出一片天地
...and I'd fight my way out.

1385
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:28,620
那是我唯一想做的，弗蘭基
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1386
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:33,260
我只是不想為那個和你打
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1387
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,600
我得到了我要的
I got what I needed.

1388
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:44,060
全部都得到了
I got it all.

1389
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:50,640
別讓他們從我身邊一點點地拿走
Don't let them keep taking it away from me.

1390
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:00,680
別讓我一直躺在這 直到聽不見人們的歡呼聲為止
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear those people chanting no more.

1391
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:07,930
我不能
I can't.

1392
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:10,730
求求你
Please.

1393
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:15,260
拜托，不要求我
Please, don't ask me.

1394
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:19,470
我在求呢
I'm asking.

1395
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:24,950
我不能
I can't.

1396
01:55:08,830 --> 01:55:10,820
喂？
Hello?

1397
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:17,930
午夜時分...
In the middle of the night...

1398
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:21,430
...麥琪自己找到了辦法
...Maggie had found her own solution.

1399
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:24,170
她咬舌了
She had bit her tongue.

1400
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:34,110
停下來，停下來
Stop. Stop.

1401
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,220
看著我，看著我
Look at me. Look at me.

1402
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:58,150
差點失血過多而死 直到他們把她的傷口縫合
Nearly bled to death before they stitched her up.

1403
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:02,830
在弗蘭基到來以前，她恢復了知覺 把縫上的傷口又撕開了
She came around and ripped them out before Frankie even got there.

1404
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:05,180
他們又把傷口縫起來
They stitched her up again...

1405
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:08,950
墊起了舌頭 以免她再咬舌自盡
...padded the tongue so she couldn't bite.

1406
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:29,600
你不能那么做，你知道的
You can't do it, you know that.

1407
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:33,410
我知道，神父
I do, Father.

1408
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:35,990
可你不知道她有多遲鈍
But you don't know how thick she is...

1409
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:38,970
訓練她有多難
...how hard it was to train her.

1410
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:43,020
其他拳手你叫他們做什么 他們就做什么
Other fighters would do exactly what you'd say to them...

1411
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:48,980
但她卻會問為什么這樣，為什么那樣 然后還是按自己的方式去做
...and she'd ask, why this and why that, and then do it her own way anyway.

1412
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:51,920
她能去爭奪冠軍，我....
How she fought for the title, I...

1413
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:53,620
不是靠任何....
It wasn't by anything...

1414
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:56,820
不是靠聽我的話
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1415
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,170
但是她現在想死
But now she wants to die...

1416
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:10,570
而我只想把她留在我身邊
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1417
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:19,150
我向上帝起誓，神父
And I swear to God, Father, it's...

1418
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:22,490
這樣做是犯罪
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1419
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:26,060
讓她活下去，實際上是在殺死她
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1420
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:29,490
你明白我的意思么？ 我怎么才能克服呢？
Do you know what I mean? How do I get around that?

1421
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:33,670
你不需要，你不要插手，弗蘭基
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1422
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,770
把她交托給上帝
You leave her with God.

1423
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:40,000
她沒有求上帝幫忙 她求我幫忙
She's not asking for God's help. She's asking for mine.

1424
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:44,140
23年了，我基本上每天 都能在彌撒上見到你，弗蘭基
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass almost every day for 23 years.

1425
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:46,340
只有那些為了某些事 而不能原諒自己的人
The only person comes to church that much...

1426
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,180
才會這么頻繁地來教堂
...is the kind who can't forgive himself for something.

1427
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:50,720
無論你身上背負著什么罪
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1428
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:53,450
都無法和這個相提并論
...they're nothing compared to this.

1429
01:57:53,450 --> 01:57:58,220
忘記上帝，天堂和地獄吧
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1430
01:57:58,390 --> 01:58:01,970
如果你那么做，你會迷失的
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1431
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:07,200
深深地迷失
Somewhere so deep...

1432
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:11,440
深到再也找不回自我了
...you'll never find yourself again.

1433
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:20,050
我想我已經是了
I think I did it already.

1434
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:45,270
我們一直給她鎮靜劑 好保證她不會再那么做
We're keeping her sedated so she won't try that again.

1435
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:53,140
我今早去看了麥琪
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1436
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,870
你一定是去了其他地方
You must have been somewhere else.

1437
01:59:58,050 --> 01:59:59,910
是啊
Yeah.

1438
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,850
你在和一個我不認識的對手奮戰？
You got a fight I don't know about?

1439
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,520
那不是你的錯
It wasn't your fault.

1440
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,090
我當時那么說是錯誤的
I was wrong to say that.

1441
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:18,300
你說得真對
You're damn right.

1442
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,030
我給你找到一個拳手
I found you a fighter...

1443
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,730
你讓她發揮出了最大的潛力
...and you made her the best fighter she could be.

1444
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,780
我殺了她
I killed her.

1445
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:30,810
別那么說
Don't say that.

1446
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:33,740
麥琪走進那扇門的時候 除了膽量什么都沒有
Maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts.

1447
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,110
根本沒有機會實現她的夢想
No chance in the world of being what she needed to be.

1448
02:00:37,290 --> 02:00:40,690
一年半以后，她在爭奪世界冠軍
A year and a half later, she's fighting for the championship of the world.

1449
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,090
是你的功勞
You did that.

1450
02:00:44,330 --> 02:00:46,850
每天都有人死去的，弗蘭基
People die every day, Frankie.

1451
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:48,900
拖地的時候，刷碗的時候
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1452
02:00:49,230 --> 02:00:51,170
你知道他們最后一個念頭是什么嗎？
And you know what their last thought is?

1453
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:53,800
“我從沒有過機會”
"I never got my shot."

1454
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:56,600
因為有你，麥琪得到了屬于她的機會
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1455
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,540
如果她今天就死去 你知道她最后一個念頭是什么嗎？
If she dies today, you know what her last thought will be?

1456
02:01:02,410 --> 02:01:04,780
“我覺得我干得不錯”
"I think I did all right."

1457
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:14,950
我會覺得心安理得的
I know I could rest with that.

1458
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:18,690
是啊
Yeah.

1459
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:21,090
是啊
Yeah.

1460
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:33,840
是啊
Yeah.

1461
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,510
我去沖杯咖啡
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1462
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,170
好
Yeah.

1463
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:43,740
好了
All right.

1464
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,390
我會拔掉你的呼吸器...
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1465
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:53,520
...然后你就會睡著
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1466
02:02:58,230 --> 02:03:00,960
然后我給你打一針，你就...
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

1467
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:03,660
...會一直睡下去
...stay asleep.

1468
02:03:09,010 --> 02:03:10,770
“莫 庫什勒”...
Mo cuishle...

1469
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:15,900
...的意思是“我的摯愛，我的血肉”
...means "my darling, my blood."

1470
02:04:24,010 --> 02:04:26,810
他只給她打了一針
He gave her a single shot.

1471
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:31,420
腎上腺素的劑量是需要量的好幾倍
It was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over.

1472
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:34,620
他不想讓她再受一次苦
He didn't want her going through this again.

1473
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:26,170
然后他走出門去
Then he walked out.

1474
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:30,080
我想他什么都沒有了
I don't think he had anything left.

1475
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:50,860
我回到拳擊館
I went back to the gym.

1476
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:54,830
等待著，認為他總有一天會回來
Waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.

1477
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:17,890
就在那時一個鬼魂走進門來
And that's when a ghost came through the door.

1478
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:23,490
我想過你說的話了 斯科雷普先生
I got to thinking what you said, Mr.Scrap.

1479
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:26,230
結果呢，丹吉爾？
What was that, Danger?

1480
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,430
每個人都會失敗的
Anybody can lose one fight.

1481
02:06:31,670 --> 02:06:33,510
這是實話
That's the truth.

1482
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:36,900
去吧，戴上手套 你已經很長時間沒訓練了
Go on, put your gloves on. You missed a lot of training.

1483
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,350
好的，斯科雷普先生，沒問題
Will do, Mr.Scrap. Sure thing.

1484
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:04,010
弗蘭基再也沒回來
Frankie never came back at all.

1485
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,580
（兇狠是不夠的）

1486
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:22,590
弗蘭基沒留下訊息 沒人知道他去了哪
Frankie didn't leave a note, and nobody knew where he went.

1487
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:25,290
我希望他是去找你了
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...

1488
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:28,460
去再次請求你的原諒
...and ask you one more time to forgive him.

1489
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:32,070
但也許他心中什么都沒有了
But maybe he didn't have anything left in his heart.

1490
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:35,940
我只希望他能找到個地方 享受片刻的安寧
I just hope he found someplace where he could find a little peace.

1491
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:39,380
一個雪松和橡樹環繞
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1492
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:42,750
比偏僻更偏僻的地方
Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

1493
02:07:42,750 --> 02:07:46,820
但那可能只是一廂情愿
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1494
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:49,350
無論他在哪兒
No matter where he is...

1495
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:55,670
我想你該知道你父親 究竟是個什么樣的人
...I thought you should know what kind of man your father really was.

1496
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,200


1497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
