1
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,460
Do it!

2
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,970
You got him! You got him!

3
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,390
I only ever met one man
I wouldn 't wanna fight.

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
I can't stop that.

5
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,130
Get out of here, you useless tit.

6
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,270
When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,670
Can you stop it?

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,170
Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.

9
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,930
No.

10
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,380
Let me have a Iook at him.

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,210
He's fine. He's fine.

12
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,680
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

13
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,460
I'II give you one more round.

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,530
-Seconds out. Let's go.
-What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,730
You Iet him hit you.

16
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,960
Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.

17
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,300
Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,070
Maybe you got a severed vein...

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,980
...or you just can 't get the coagulant
deep enough.

20
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,580
-Come on!
-Break. Break.

21
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,410
There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,820
...down in the different layers of meat...

23
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,890
...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,700
-That' s it! Come on!
-What are you doing?

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,100
Knock him out, Willie!

26
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,550
People love violence.

27
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,120
They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.

28
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,560
Same people claim to love boxing.

29
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,060
They got no idea what it is.

30
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,720
Boxing is about respect.

31
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,730
Getting it for yourself...

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,230
...and taking it away from the other guy.

33
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,610
I'II warm up the car.

34
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,210
Mr. Dunn?

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,380
I owe you money?

36
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,810
No, sir.

37
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,470
I know your mama?

38
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,780
Don't rightly know, sir.

39
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,420
-Then what is it you want?
-I was on the undercard.

40
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,180
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

42
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,450
-Did you happen to see it?
-Nope.

43
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,060
I did pretty good.

44
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,720
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

45
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,630
I don't train girls.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,260
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,310
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
It's a mistake.

49
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,660
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

50
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,330
Just push, will you?

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,130
-What did Hogan want?
-Offered us a title shot.

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,170
About time.

53
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,310
I turned him down flat.

54
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,910
Two or three more fights, you'II be ready.

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,380
Been two or three more fights
for a Iong time now, Frankie.

56
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,950
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,110
You Iose it,
it may not come around again.

58
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,130
Now, two or three more fights
and we'II be ready.

59
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,960
Whatever you say, Frankie.

60
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,960
Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,240
...that everything in boxing is backwards.

62
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,470
Sometimes...

63
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,370
...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,820
Well, do your best, Lord...

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,190
...protect Katy.

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,860
Annie too.

67
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,320
Other than that...

68
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,460
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

69
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,500
But step back too far,
you ain 't fighting at all.

70
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,090
-Bye.
-Bye.

71
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,890
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

72
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,530
What's confusing you this week?

73
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,170
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

74
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,570
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

75
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,230
Is it sort of Iike Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

76
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,610
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

77
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,550
The only reason you come to Mass
is to wind me up.

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,780
-It won't happen this morning.
-I'm confused.

79
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,250
-No, you aren't.
-Yes, I am.

80
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,620
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

81
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,260
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

82
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,260
-What about the Holy Ghost?
-He's an expression of God's Iove.

83
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,020
-And Jesus?
-Son of God. Don't play stupid.

84
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,560
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

85
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,100
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,450
-Did you write your daughter?
-Absolutely.

87
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,170
Now you're Iying to a priest.

88
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,910
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

89
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,460
Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.

90
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,470
Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter
who 's nothing but heart...

91
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,800
...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating. "

92
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,580
Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.

93
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,440
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting FIippo Bam-Bam Barch...

94
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,490
...out of Broward County, T exas!

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,050
Danger showed up
a couple of years back.

96
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,930
He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama 's new boyfriend.

97
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,370
Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.

98
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,140
Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.

99
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,050
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

100
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,490
Well, that's nice to hear.

101
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,250
Yeah, Iots of people where
I comes from does...

102
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,020
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,860
...niggers or not.

104
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,660
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

105
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,130
Just one of those questions you ask...

106
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,470
...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,670
Well, sir, I'd Iikes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

108
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,840
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

109
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,710
...Thomas " Hit Man" Hearns...

110
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,980
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,790
Yo, FIip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

112
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,790
You gotta have at Ieast one fight
to be ranked.

113
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,300
Hey, I'II fight any man, anytime!

114
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,390
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

115
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,560
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

116
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,600
-Shawrelle.
-I will.

117
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,010
Leave him alone.

118
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,470
Danger, you go on back to training.

119
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,340
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

120
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,920
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,150
I'II give you that ass-whupping Iater,
OIive Oyl.

122
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,620
Hey, bro, those pants Iook
real pretty on you.

123
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,450
Give his mama back her tights.

124
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,430
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...

125
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,670
...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.

126
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,030
Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 1 7 years ago.

127
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,510
Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.

128
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,240
Bobby died while he was packing.

129
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,810
And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.

130
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,080
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

131
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,850
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

132
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,890
Well, he's hurting me.

133
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,220
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air Iike he thinks it's gonna punch back.

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,900
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

135
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,660
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

136
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,630
It smells better, Frankie.

137
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,370
BIeach smells Iike bleach.

138
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,580
-Hey, Scrap.
-Hey, Mr. Willie.

139
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,880
Hey, nice fight Iast night.

140
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,990
Nice fight.

141
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,990
-Big Willie.
-Hey, Sally.

142
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,770
-Nice fight.
-Thanks, man.

143
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,600
People are talking.

144
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,280
What the hell kind of Ianguage is that?

145
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,230
What do you want?

146
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,690
I thought you might Iike to know
you got a fighter out there...

147
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,560
...not talking to another manager.

148
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,140
Not talking to another manager?

149
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,930
And not just any manager.

150
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,700
Mickey Mack.

151
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,840
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

152
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,450
Not a word. Neither one of them.

153
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,690
I'm trying to read here.

154
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,120
Well, if you think that's more important.

155
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,930
Who's your new girl?

156
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,860
What?

157
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,430
Jesus Christ.

158
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,940
Better hurry up.

159
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,940
She keeps hitting it Iike that,
she gonna break her wrists.

160
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,150
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

161
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,920
Thought you might change your mind.

162
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,160
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

163
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,820
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'II do fine.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

165
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,500
-Willie, you ready to work?
-Anytime.

166
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,570
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

167
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,910
No.

168
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,980
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

169
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,310
She came from southwestern Missouri...

170
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,510
...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...

171
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,720
...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

172
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,020
She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.

173
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,310
It's for my dog.

174
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,040
She'd come 1 800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

175
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,800
Working the bag, boss.

176
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,140
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

177
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Give her her money back.

178
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,750
You sure?

179
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,890
-How much did she pay?
-Six months.

180
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,430
-Jesus Christ.
-No, I'II give it back.

181
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,040
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

182
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,830
Woman thinks I'II throw away
six months' worth of dues...

183
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,240
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

184
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,040
-But just don't encourage her, understand?
-Okay.

185
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,010
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he Iooking at?

186
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,750
Looks Iike a bottle of water.

187
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,210
He paid his dues?

188
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,920
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

189
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,000
Get out of my office.

190
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,970
Fuck me.

191
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,650
Can't think of it as a bag.

192
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd Iike.

193
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,630
Appreciate any help I can get.

194
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,110
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

195
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,570
And he's constantly moving.

196
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,200
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. AII right?

197
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,910
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

198
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,420
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

199
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,110
So you watch him real carefully.

200
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,590
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

201
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,490
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

202
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,430
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

203
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,800
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

204
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,880
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

205
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,700
-Good, good, good.
-Like that?

206
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,310
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

207
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,910
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

208
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,890
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

209
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,850
Now, you get this down,
we'II put you on the speed bag.

210
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,820
You do have a speed bag.

211
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,470
I'II just borrow it till I can buy my own.

212
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,240
AII right, you go on home now.

213
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,280
-I'II walk out with you?
-No, I am home.

214
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,640
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

215
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,920
It's nice.

216
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,960
Would it bother you
if I worked a Iittle Ionger?

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,490
No, just pull the door closed
when you Ieave.

218
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,510
Thank you.

219
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,380
If there's magic in boxing...

220
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,190
...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...

221
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,660
...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.

222
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,610
It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.

223
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,330
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

224
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,360
Hey, that's it. That's it.

225
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,430
Hands up.

226
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,430
Jab, jab, jab.

227
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,880
Hey, FIip.

228
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,180
Hey, FIippy, come here, man.

229
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,950
I think I found somebody you can beat.

230
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,190
I don't fights women.

231
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,690
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

232
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,490
Because she--
Like, you, you could fight to him...

233
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,330
...and then you could kiss to him.

234
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,170
Then you fight to him one more time.

235
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,060
That's beautiful, man. That's Iike poetry.

236
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,670
-It's Iike poetry.
-You been reading and shit.

237
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,410
-Thanks, bro.
-That's a girl, man?

238
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,020
FIip, I think you right. Look at her Iittle
bitty titties. They're Iike mosquito bites.

239
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,850
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

240
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,650
Saw your Iast fight, Shawrelle.

241
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,720
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

242
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,490
Canvas has titties.
Hey, Iook at me. I'm Shawrelle.

243
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,540
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

244
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,980
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

245
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,150
Shut up, man.
What you Iaughing at?

246
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,020
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

247
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,630
Some titties right there, man.

248
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,660
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, FIippy?

249
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,360
Punk.

250
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,470
AII right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

251
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,970
-I'II give you a rubdown.
-Oh, I can't, Frankie.

252
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,170
Middle one's got a piano Iesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

253
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,480
-Something wrong with Gracie's car?
-She hates that car.

254
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,950
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

255
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,780
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

256
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,650
I'd appreciate that.

257
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,160
Okay.

258
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,090
-Thanks.
-See you Iater.

259
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,310
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

260
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,270
You ever do any work around here?

261
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,740
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

262
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,080
Little girl seems to be coming along.

263
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,220
Yeah. It's almost Iike
someone's been helping her.

264
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,190
She might just be a natural.
Looks Iike she's got something.

265
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,460
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

266
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,400
I wonder how the hell she got that.

267
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,100
I wonder.

268
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,110
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

269
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,810
-This bag?
-Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

270
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,820
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

271
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,550
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

272
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,690
Yes. Yes, it is.

273
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,060
Every time you touch it,
you're Iosing me business out here.

274
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,530
-I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
-Yeah.

275
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,330
Well, I can't just Iend it
to anybody, you know.

276
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,870
I understand.

277
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,130
Yeah.

278
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,910
Look, you seem Iike a nice girl.

279
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,040
-Can I give you some advice?
-I'd appreciate that.

280
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,140
You'II find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

281
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,380
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

282
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,750
It's the Iatest freak show out there.

283
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,330
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

284
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,160
...because you're too old.

285
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,820
I don't feel that old.

286
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,530
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

287
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,200
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

288
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,470
How old are you?

289
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,510
-Thirty-one until my next birthday.
-Oh, well, there you go.

290
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,200
Thirty-one.

291
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,080
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

292
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,190
AIready been working it
for three years.

293
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,050
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

294
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,050
Never had any, boss.

295
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,490
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

296
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,760
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

297
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,930
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

298
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,690
Yeah.

299
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

300
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,910
-You're not gonna cry now, are you?
-No, sir.

301
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,040
Yeah.

302
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,710
Here.

303
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,280
-Keep the goddamn thing.
-No, you need it.

304
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,250
No, take the bag.

305
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,590
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

306
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,160
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

307
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,960
-I'II just borrow it till I buy my own.
-Yeah.

308
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,570
Just don't Iose it.

309
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,700
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

310
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,680
...your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

311
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,510
...but if I don't see 40 percent--

312
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,260
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

313
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,060
-Hey, Willie.
-Hey, Frankie.

314
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,830
Something wrong?

315
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,870
I'm sorry to come by your house Iike this.
I know you don't Iike people dropping in.

316
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,410
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

317
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,450
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

318
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,450
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

319
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,820
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

320
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,820
Gracie cried when she saw it.

321
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,690
Really?

322
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,790
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

323
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,990
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

324
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,000
Everything but the split.

325
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,030
I gotta Ieave you, Frankie.

326
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,530
What?

327
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,240
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

328
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,650
It ain't that, it's--
It's Iike you said, I got one shot.

329
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,740
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

330
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,690
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

331
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,490
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

332
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,060
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

333
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,130
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

334
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,530
Only way he'd do it.

335
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,240
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how Iong
you waiting on a title.

336
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,930
I wish it could've been with me.

337
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,740
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

338
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,750
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

339
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,300
There's some things people
just don 't want to hear.

340
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,910
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas " Hit Man" Hearns...

341
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,380
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

342
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,250
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

343
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,420
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

344
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,130
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

345
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,970
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'II be right back.

346
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

347
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,650
No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.

348
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,990
I heard about Willie.

349
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,330
That's cold. That's dead cold.

350
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,530
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

351
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,610
Yeah, well, at Ieast I can see
through both eyes.

352
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,280
Didn't do you
a Iot of good though, did it?

353
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,510
Well, I've got the gym.

354
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,080
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

355
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,740
Willie tell you why?

356
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,820
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

357
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,320
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

358
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,190
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

359
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,330
How's that for not believing in him?

360
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,900
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

361
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm amazed he stayed around this Iong.

362
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,600
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

363
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,670
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

364
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,170
Not protect him?

365
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,750
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

366
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,410
-Yeah.
-Well, now it makes sense.

367
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,150
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

368
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,550
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

369
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,020
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

370
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,650
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you Iost your eye?

371
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
I had my shot.

372
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,730
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

373
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,130
Yeah, well, I remember.

374
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,070
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his Iife...

375
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,440
-...cleaning up other people's spit.
-Yeah, right.

376
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,740
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one Iearning Greek.

377
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,940
It's Gaelic.

378
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,250
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

379
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,220
How do you say that in Gaelic?

380
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,760
Sorry.

381
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,370
Thanks.

382
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,770
The action continues as the champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...

383
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,930
...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.

384
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,770
Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left....

385
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,450
Boxing is an unnatural act.

386
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,950
Because everything in it is backwards.

387
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,850
You wanna move to the left...

388
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,390
... you don 't step left,
you push on the right toe.

389
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,050
To move right, you use your left toe.

390
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,170
Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...

391
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,800
... you step into it.

392
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,300
But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,
he hits the champ with a right hand.

393
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,910
And the champ is down.

394
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,380
Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.

395
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,910
And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.

396
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,710
It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...

397
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,220
...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.

398
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,890
Everything in boxing is backwards.

399
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,840
Want a cheeseburger?

400
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,810
-You bought me a cheeseburger?
-Yeah.

401
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,010
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

402
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,210
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

403
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,480
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

404
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,630
-You watch the fight?
-Yeah, I watched it.

405
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,060
Willie did good.

406
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,790
That's what you've got to say?

407
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,560
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

408
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:52,970
I see you been working on yourself,
Iearning to open up. That's good work.

409
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,870
You watch it?

410
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,240
Yeah, I got HBO.

411
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,550
Now, how can you afford HBO?

412
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,550
How Iong have I been telling you
to save your money?

413
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,250
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

414
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,580
...at the Stadium CIub
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

415
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,480
-That true?
-Yeah.

416
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,320
Manager ran off
and Ieft you and me to hitch home.

417
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,800
Don't you remember nothing?

418
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,430
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be Iynched.

419
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,510
I remember you Ieaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

420
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,130
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

421
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,800
I had to walk back two miles.

422
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,150
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

423
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,480
What the hell's that?

424
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,020
It's her birthday.

425
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,370
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

426
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,380
So it's your birthday, huh?

427
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,790
How old does that make you?

428
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,820
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

429
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,590
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

430
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,730
...which is what I been doing since 1 3.

431
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,930
And according to you, I'II be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

432
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,830
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

433
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,200
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

434
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,500
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

435
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,270
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

436
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,010
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 31 2 pounds.

437
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,480
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

438
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,060
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

439
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,020
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

440
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,200
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

441
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,860
That enough truth to suit you?

442
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,340
This your speed bag?

443
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,500
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

444
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,010
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

445
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,310
I'II show you a few things,
and then we'II get you a trainer.

446
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,110
No, sorry.

447
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,760
-You're in a position to negotiate?
-Yes, sir.

448
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

449
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,190
I seen you Iooking at me.

450
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,300
-Yeah, out of pity.
-Don't you say that.

451
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,330
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

452
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,230
I want a trainer.

453
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,310
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

454
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,780
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

455
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,250
Stop, stop, stop.

456
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,450
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

457
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,820
Okay.

458
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,560
If I'm gonna take you on--

459
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,220
-You won't never regret it.
-Look, just Iisten to me.

460
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,240
-If I take you on--
-I promise I'II work so hard.

461
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,810
God, this is a mistake already.

462
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,400
I'm Iistening, boss.

463
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,810
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

464
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,020
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

465
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,290
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

466
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,690
That's all I ask.

467
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,350
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

468
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,120
-AIrighty.
-We got a deal.

469
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,470
No, not quite.

470
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

471
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,470
...then we'II get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

472
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,230
-I hate to argue with you, but--
-Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

473
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:51,180
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

474
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,280
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

475
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,650
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

476
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,380
It's the only way I'II do it.

477
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,790
AII right.

478
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,890
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

479
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,370
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

480
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,700
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

481
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,710
So here's what you do.

482
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,350
You get yourself--
Bend your knees a Iittle bit.

483
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,410
Get in an athletic position.
Look Iike you're gonna hit something.

484
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,660
-Move them how, boss?
-Just-- Go-- Hit the bag.

485
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,320
-Stop.
-What'd I do wrong?

486
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,660
Okay, you did two things wrong.

487
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,160
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

488
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,500
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

489
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,610
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

490
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,400
You can count with me if you want.

491
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,410
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

492
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,570
-Can you show me that again?
-I just--

493
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,770
Just say "one," please.

494
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,440
-One.
-Okay.

495
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,450
-One. Okay.
-One.

496
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,750
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

497
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,590
Then I move over to my right foot. You'II
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

498
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,970
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of Iike I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

499
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,510
Then I come over, and I shift to my Ieft foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

500
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,230
And ice pick maneuver again.

501
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,470
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

502
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,780
Don't watch anything but my feet.

503
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,720
Just do it Iike that. Just keep practicing.

504
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,660
You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.

505
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,740
To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.

506
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,400
Rest when you're dead.

507
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,240
Come here.

508
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,420
You can 't just tell them
to forget everything you know...

509
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,650
... you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.

510
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,000
Make them so tired
they only listen to you.

511
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,230
Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.

512
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,630
Move your feet.

513
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Move your feet around. Let' s see you go.

514
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,050
Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.

515
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,960
Not so Iow. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

516
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,060
How to generate momentum
off your right toe.

517
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,570
And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.

518
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,110
How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn 't wanna come after you.

519
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,920
Then you gotta show them
all over again.

520
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,280
Over and over and over...

521
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,430
... till they think they were born that way.

522
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,460
Shift.

523
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,530
Shift away.

524
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,730
Okay. That' s enough for today.

525
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,340
Good work. Good girl.

526
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,300
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

527
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,270
Hey. Hey, come here.

528
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,300
You're not breathing.

529
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,670
Hate to disagree with you.

530
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,110
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

531
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,720
-Now, stop doing that.
-Okay.

532
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,180
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

533
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,250
-I mean, for a girl.
-I don't train girls.

534
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,220
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

535
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,920
Well, we'II get a manager,
and we'II find out, won't we?

536
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,120
I'd Iike to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

537
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,770
-Got any family, boss?
-What?

538
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,710
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

539
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,950
No.

540
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,990
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

541
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,020
That's family.

542
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,890
We're not exactly close.

543
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,800
How much she weigh?

544
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,360
What?

545
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,730
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

546
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,700
Yeah.

547
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,070
Not very big.

548
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,340
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

549
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,910
So, what do you think?

550
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,990
I ready for a fight?

551
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,560
Hey, Sally.

552
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,690
Come here for a minute, will you?

553
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,400
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

554
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,410
-Can I see you a minute?
-Sally here's a real good manager.

555
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,540
Has a couple of Golden GIove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

556
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,680
I'm Iooking for a good one.

557
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,020
Well, see, there you go.

558
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,550
Nice working with you, girlie.

559
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,790
-What'd you want?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

560
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,100
I ain't Iying, I've been watching you work.
You got a hell of a Ieft.

561
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,870
Thank you.

562
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,470
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

563
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,810
-Yeah, sure.
-Good.

564
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,470
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

565
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,190
Break.

566
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,560
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

567
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,430
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

568
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,900
-I ain't doing great, I'm Iosing.
-You're wearing her down.

569
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,410
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

570
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,010
-Come on.
-Do it.

571
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,710
Come on, Iet's do this!

572
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,150
That's it!

573
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
Nice night, eh?

574
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,300
Jesus Christ.

575
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,330
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

576
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,300
Hell of a fighter.

577
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,530
1 1 -0.

578
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,680
Your Ieft. Keep your Ieft up.

579
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,540
Lonnie's got a Iot of good fighters.

580
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,850
He's got Joey Adagio,
Iightweight champ?

581
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,510
Yeah.

582
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,720
Your Ieft, damn it.

583
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,290
Wouldn't have been my choice for
her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

584
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,190
-He must think she can take her.
-Jesus H.

585
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,000
Your Ieft. Keep your Ieft up.

586
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,430
You think she can hear you
from back here?

587
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,250
Of course, if Maggie Ioses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

588
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,410
Might even help him.

589
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,490
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

590
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,220
...Lonnie might Iet Sally's Iightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

591
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,830
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

592
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,430
Hey, what do I know?

593
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,330
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

594
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,060
Mother of God.

595
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,430
Okay, break.

596
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,970
Hey. Come here, come here.

597
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,540
Hey. Get over here.

598
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,540
You're dropping your Ieft hand.
Quit dropping your Ieft hand.

599
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,440
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

600
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,020
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your Iightweight?

601
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,110
Dunn.

602
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,780
-What are you doing?
-I'm talking. What are you doing?

603
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,860
-Is this your fighter?
-It's my fighter.

604
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,420
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

605
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,720
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

606
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,300
-Somebody tell me what's going on.
-I was Iate. Sally was just subbing for me.

607
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,900
You telling me this is your fighter?

608
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,470
Yeah, this is my fighter.

609
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,340
Then you got 1 0 seconds.

610
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,810
I keep holding my Ieft up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

611
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,040
-Well, Iet it drop.
-That'd be a Iot easier.

612
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,380
She thinks she knows you.

613
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,580
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

614
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,990
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

615
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,150
-When she cocks that right hand-- You hear?
-I hear you, boss.

616
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,320
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

617
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,830
-Got one?
-Got it right here.

618
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,760
-Okay.
-Fight, or I'm calling it.

619
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,930
-Go give it to her.
-The body knows what fighters don 't.

620
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,340
How to protect itself.

621
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,310
A neck can only twist so far.

622
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,680
Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:

623
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,010
"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don 't know what you're doing. "

624
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,020
Neutral corner.

625
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,350
-See the way she did that?
-Yeah.

626
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,490
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl ' s got sugar.

627
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:45,290
"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses. "

628
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,700
It's called the knockout mechanism.

629
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,570
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

630
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,670
Thanks, boss.

631
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,410
You.... You forgot the rule.

632
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,010
-Now, what is the rule?
-Keep my Ieft up?

633
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,150
It's to protect yourself at all times.

634
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,280
Now, what is the rule?

635
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,790
-Protect myself at all times.
-Good, good.

636
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,190
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

637
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,020
It wasn't.

638
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,650
It's okay.

639
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,200
-I'II work on my Ieft, boss.
-Drink your water.

640
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,000
Other than that, how'd I do?

641
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,310
Fine. You did fine.

642
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,800
You gonna Ieave me again?

643
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,640
Never.

644
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:37,180
That place you work, do they have
homemade Iemon meringue pie there?

645
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,350
-Sure.
-Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

646
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,220
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the Iabel.

647
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,720
-I want you to take the weekend off.
-It's only Thursday.

648
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,590
-You gonna argue with me?
-Know better than to do that, boss.

649
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,000
Well, good.

650
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,830
All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.

651
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,710
Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.

652
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,140
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

653
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,620
Truth is, even if they're wrong...

654
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,780
...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...

655
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,790
...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain 't fighters at all.

656
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,230
-Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
-You sure did, boss.

657
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,130
That was Iast night.

658
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,100
You said not to argue with you.

659
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,210
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

660
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,350
You want my advice?

661
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,990
What?

662
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,410
Where are your shoes?

663
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,780
I'm airing out my feet.

664
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,400
You got big holes in your socks.

665
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,420
Oh, they're not that big.

666
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,470
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

667
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,800
These are my sleeping socks.

668
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,840
My feet Iike a Iittle air at night.

669
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,680
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

670
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,840
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

671
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,680
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

672
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,650
PIease?

673
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,870
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

674
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,970
Might find its way to the track.

675
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,720
It's over. It's over.

676
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,230
Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.

677
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,120
I got the breathing thing down.

678
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,850
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

679
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,550
-Thought that was the point.
-The point is to get good.

680
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,790
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

681
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,160
How am I gonna get you fights?

682
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,270
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

683
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,070
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

684
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,840
Because you haven't got the Iungs
for six rounds.

685
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,210
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

686
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,380
Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...

687
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,750
...just to let her know who was boss.

688
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,790
Three, four, five...

689
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,090
...six, seven....

690
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,860
Sorry, boss.

691
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,090
Maggie left no doubt about it.

692
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,240
AII right, Iet's do it.

693
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,380
Her first six-rounder
didn 't go quite as smooth.

694
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,970
Get up!

695
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,800
To your corner.

696
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,140
-Three, four, five...
-Get up.

697
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,540
-...six, seven...
-Get up.

698
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,770
-...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
-You can do this.

699
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,490
Maggie didn 't knock her out
till the end of the first round.

700
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,820
After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.

701
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,920
Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...

702
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,130
...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.

703
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,620
That only worked for so long.

704
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,910
Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.

705
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,150
He took a chance.

706
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,650
Box.

707
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,490
He moved her up in class.

708
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,530
That could've been a mistake.

709
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,810
Watch the right!

710
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,380
Watch it. Watch it.

711
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:24,160
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

712
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,210
Damn, damn, damn.

713
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,150
Give us two seconds, will you?

714
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,040
-Okay.
-Just two seconds.

715
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,080
-Your nose is broke.
-Oh, damn.

716
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,020
-Fix it.
-I can't, I can't.

717
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,710
-You can fix it.
-I can't. I've gotta call it.

718
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,790
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

719
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,990
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

720
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,690
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

721
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,130
PIease, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

722
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,470
Bite down on this.

723
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,120
-Inhale.
-What?

724
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,720
-Inhale.
-What?

725
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,850
Breathe in.

726
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,830
-Okay, huh?
-Yeah, it's okay.

727
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:43,170
AII right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

728
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,470
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

729
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,840
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

730
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,740
Now get going.

731
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,330
Go to your corner.

732
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,260
Three, four, five...

733
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,130
-Come on, breathe. Breathe.
-...six, seven, eight...

734
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,400
...nine, ten.

735
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,300
Mo cuishle.

736
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,580
-AII right!
-Yeah!

737
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,860
Right.

738
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,820
What you reading?

739
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,990
What's she saying?

740
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,860
Wants to know what you're reading.

741
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,970
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

742
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,840
Why don't you talk
a Iittle Yeats to her.

743
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,640
Show her what a treat that is.

744
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,180
When the hell they gonna get to her?

745
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,610
I'm okay, Frankie.

746
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,320
-What'd you Iearn tonight?
-AIways protect myself.

747
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,580
-What's the rule?
-AIways protect myself.

748
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,620
-Margaret Fitzgerald?
-Here.

749
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,130
I'II be right here.

750
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,540
-How you doing?
-Me?

751
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,680
-Yeah, you.
-I'm not the one who's hurt.

752
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,350
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

753
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,390
Why are you telling me that?

754
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,920
No reason.

755
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:44,290
But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.

756
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,130
And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can 't stop the bleeding.

757
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,670
-Did you write your daughter?
-Every week.

758
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,200
I've no idea why you come to church.

759
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:33,110
After her 1 2th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.

760
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,280
The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...

761
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,820
...for the WBA welterweight title.

762
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,550
Billie "The BIue Bear."

763
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,850
Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.

764
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,230
Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

765
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,080
Didn 't seem to matter to her...

766
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,880
...that something like that
could kill a person.

767
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,990
And the crowds loved her.

768
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,900
He turned it down
without even telling her.

769
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:26,330
The next was to fight
the British champ...

770
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,800
-...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.
-Hello?

771
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,600
Not interested.

772
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,000
He turned that down too.

773
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,480
That' s a Iot of money, boss.

774
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:46,110
Yeah, you ' re making money.
What are you still working here for?

775
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,980
It's a title match, right?

776
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,150
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

777
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,660
She's got nothing to Iose,
you got nothing to win.

778
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,020
Might still be a good fight.

779
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,730
Yeah, I just-- I just brought you up
to welterweight.

780
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,360
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

781
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,510
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

782
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,510
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

783
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,520
In fact, if you'd Iearn
to protect your face a Iittle better...

784
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,210
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

785
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,120
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

786
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,960
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

787
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,790
I made us a reservation.

788
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:04,600
You might wanna shower.

789
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,020
Here you go.

790
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,060
Here you go.

791
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,260
What's this?

792
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,730
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

793
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,730
Go on and blow.

794
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,370
Thank you.

795
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,970
Thirty-three ain't so old.

796
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,550
I was still fighting at 39.

797
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:58,380
Fought for 23 years.

798
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,790
How's it going, Scrap?

799
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,620
Doing good, Mickey.

800
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,490
Doing good.

801
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,430
-What'II you have?
-Coffee.

802
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,210
You two not speaking?

803
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,870
Don't hardly know him.

804
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:32,020
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

805
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,620
He was picking up cut work.

806
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:40,290
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

807
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,620
Good man to have in your corner.

808
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,500
Yes, he is.

809
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,270
He stayed with me
through my Iast fight in San Berdu.

810
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,510
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

811
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,540
...and it was just Frankie and me.

812
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,250
I was taking a hellacious beating.

813
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:09,020
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

814
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,660
Nobody tells you what that number is.

815
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,260
Mine was 1 09.

816
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:19,130
I just didn't want to admit it.

817
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,240
Fourth round, this...

818
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,370
...cut opens up.

819
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,640
BIood starts pouring into my eye.

820
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:34,510
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

821
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,880
BIood was what I was there for.

822
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:41,320
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

823
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,880
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

824
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,390
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

825
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:50,700
Round after round...

826
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,200
...he's arguing with me.

827
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:58,670
And I'm almost Iaughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

828
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,070
I go 1 5 rounds...

829
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,480
...Iose by decision.

830
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,510
Next morning, I Iose the eye.

831
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,550
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

832
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,550
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he Iooks at me.

833
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,190
Somehow...

834
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,860
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

835
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,030
...should've saved my eye.

836
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:34,370
Spends his Iife wishing he could
take back that 1 09th fight.

837
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,150
I wanted to go to 1 1 0.

838
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,740
Thing is...

839
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,220
...if you wanna get to the title...

840
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,220
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

841
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,560
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

842
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,960
You go on, eat your cupcake.

843
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,870
No, I got it.

844
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,810
It's the rule.

845
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,380
Always protect yourself.

846
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:15,780
People never take their own advice.

847
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:20,980
If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.

848
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,300
Mr. Mickey Mack?

849
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,800
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

850
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:35,830
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

851
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,330
But I thought you should know
I ain't never Ieaving Mr. Dunn...

852
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,270
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

853
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,720
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

854
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:55,620
Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.

855
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:32,660
The letters always came back
marked the same way:

856
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:35,020
"Return to sender. "

857
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,090
I ' II make you some coffee.

858
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,730
What are you doing with your money?

859
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,430
-Saving it.
-Good girl.

860
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,670
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a Iittle house.

861
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,170
Cash, no mortgage.

862
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,900
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

863
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:29,250
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

864
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,050
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

865
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,450
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

866
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,330
You understand?

867
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:41,390
Pretty soon, you wait Iong enough,
you got nothing.

868
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,560
Okay, soon as I get the money.

869
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:47,790
I made a Iot of mistakes in my Iife. I'm just
trying to keep you from doing the same.

870
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,900
I know, boss.

871
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,680
-I'm not gonna Iive forever.
-What is it?

872
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,510
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

873
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,010
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to-- Hey.

874
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,850
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

875
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,650
-Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

876
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:10,260
You're welcome, darling. Here, just--
Here, Iet me put this in the machine.

877
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:12,450
What machine?

878
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,620
Don't have a TV, huh?

879
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,560
No.

880
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah!

881
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,200
AII right. Okay.

882
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,770
-Ten minutes, Iove.
-Thank you.

883
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,510
Man says he Ioves me.

884
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,780
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

885
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,180
First since my daddy.

886
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,480
I win, you think he'II propose?

887
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,980
You win, I'II propose.

888
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,730
Look, I got you a gift here.

889
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,770
I think they gave you somebody else's.

890
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,910
No, no, this is it.

891
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,410
What's it mean?

892
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,410
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

893
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:08,040
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah, I thought so.

894
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,050
-Yeah.
-Real silk thread.

895
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,990
From the United States
of America, the challenger...

896
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,490
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

897
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,360
Mo cuishle.
Did you see what was on her robe?

898
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,800
-Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
-Mo cuishle.

899
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,870
She wasn 't the main attraction.

900
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,710
She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.

901
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,070
But ask someone who was there...

902
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,240
...they couldn 't tell you who else
fought that night.

903
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,050
Box.

904
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,100
-Come on!
-Mo cuishle!

905
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:17,980
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

906
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:20,820
Mo cuishle!

907
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,220
Mo cuishle!

908
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:28,090
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

909
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,600
She's tough.

910
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,740
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

911
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,380
-You know why that is?
-Why?

912
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,750
She's a better fighter than you are.

913
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,010
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

914
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,380
...what are you gonna do about it?

915
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,200
Get in there.

916
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,490
Box.

917
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:24,920
Three, four, five, six...

918
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:30,250
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

919
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,520
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

920
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:45,000
-Mo cuishle!
-Mo cuishle!

921
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,340
I could ask someone, you know?

922
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,250
Good.

923
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,440
You find out, you Iet me know.

924
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,460
Whatever it meant, the name stuck.

925
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:13,190
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.

926
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:16,200
It was always mo cuishle.

927
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,770
Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...

928
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,270
...or people who wanna be.

929
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,170
By the time they came back
to the States...

930
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,110
...Maggie was in a whole new league.

931
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:49,690
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

932
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,710
After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.

933
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,950
What's the split?

934
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,960
-Sixty-forty.
-Good.

935
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:14,090
We'II take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

936
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,000
That Iittle girl?

937
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,730
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

938
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,700
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on Iittle Miss What's-Her-Name?

939
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:26,930
You find someone who says that,
and we'II take the 40.

940
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,180
There you go.

941
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:42,890
They're at 60-40,
but they'II come up to 50-50.

942
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,390
How's that girl doing?

943
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,690
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

944
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,800
She be all right?

945
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:54,870
-And if she isn't?
-Maybe I should send her something.

946
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,200
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd Iike. I'm sure she'd take it.

947
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:05,980
Boss?

948
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,010
That Iittle house we talked about?

949
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:09,850
I bought it.

950
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,890
Well, smart girl.

951
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,360
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she Iives now.

952
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,650
No mortgage, just Iike you said.

953
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,990
You're a good daughter.

954
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,730
She don't know about it yet.

955
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:30,430
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

956
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:32,540
I know she wants to meet you.

957
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,740
Yeah, we could do that.

958
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,960
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

959
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:00,330
Mary M.'s here.

960
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:21,450
-This is the Johnsons' old house.
-Not anymore.

961
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,000
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

962
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:32,970
-Mary M., you bought this for me?
-Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

963
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,830
Darling....

964
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,340
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

965
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,800
They'II be here before you move in.

966
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,440
-How much money did this cost you?
-Never mind that.

967
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:46,310
-You shouldn't have done this.
-You need a decent place.

968
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,780
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

969
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,380
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

970
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,390
-Mama, no, they ain't.
-They are. You're fine, you're working...

971
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,430
...but I can't Iive without my welfare.

972
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,260
Mama, I'II send you money.

973
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:05,830
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

974
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,630
-How am I supposed to get my medicine?
-I'II send you more money.

975
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,240
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

976
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,670
He's getting out, you know.

977
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,880
Why didn't you just give me the money?

978
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,510
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

979
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:26,250
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

980
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,580
You want the money, sell it.

981
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,760
I don't--

982
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,210
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

983
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,770
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

984
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,470
-That's true, Mama.
-I'II try and keep the house.

985
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:54,310
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

986
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,380
I'II send you some more money.

987
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,790
That man hitting you?

988
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,490
It's from the fight.

989
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:13,430
I'm a fighter, Mama.

990
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,270
Find a man, Mary M.

991
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,100
Live proper.

992
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,270
People hear about what you're doing
and they Iaugh.

993
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,500
Hurts me to tell you,
but they Iaugh at you.

994
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,000
Hi.

995
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,430
You ever own a dog?

996
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,120
Nope.

997
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,890
CIosest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

998
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:03,310
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

999
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,170
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1000
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,940
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front Iegs.

1001
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,080
Me and Mardell would bust up Iaughing...

1002
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,090
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1003
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,350
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1004
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:25,290
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1005
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,870
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1006
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,090
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1007
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:36,900
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1008
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,640
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1009
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,120
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1010
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,260
Well, you've got me.

1011
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:07,900
At Ieast, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1012
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,820
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1013
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,880
Yeah.

1014
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,360
This place has
the best Iemon pie around.

1015
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,460
None of that canned-filling crap.

1016
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,700
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1017
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:52,550
I used to come here with Daddy.

1018
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,240
Wonder if a place Iike this is for sale.

1019
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,950
I got a Iittle bit of savings.

1020
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,520
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1021
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,330
Hey, what the hell's Danger Iooking at?

1022
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,410
Looks Iike another bottle of water.

1023
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,910
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1024
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:26,050
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1025
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,810
Well, she's got a title shot.
The BIue Bear.

1026
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,010
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1027
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:33,990
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1028
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,750
Well, I could use a good second.

1029
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,690
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1030
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,960
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1031
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,560
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1032
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:48,470
I thought you might Iike to feel what
it's Iike to be in a ring on a title match.

1033
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,630
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1034
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,280
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1035
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,510
Somebody with young hands.

1036
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,740
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1037
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:04,420
I Ieave this place for one day...

1038
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,420
...got any idea what it would Iook Iike
when I come back?

1039
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:09,420
Kind of Iike it Iooks right now.

1040
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,030
Oh, go to hell.

1041
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:15,930
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1042
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,890
Will do.

1043
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,940
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1044
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:27,410
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1045
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,810
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1046
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,780
Okay.

1047
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:38,110
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this Iittle tiny hole?

1048
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:40,350
I've been thinking on it.

1049
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,290
Can't figure it out.

1050
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,090
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1051
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,630
-You could do that? You could show me?
-I think so. I think so.

1052
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,830
AIso, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1053
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,130
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1054
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:02,210
-We're flying?
-Would you rather drive?

1055
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,310
You're asking me?

1056
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,720
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1057
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,650
So I finally get to decide something?

1058
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,220
That's what I'm saying.

1059
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,990
Fine.

1060
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,890
FIy there, drive back.

1061
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,920
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1062
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,860
You said it was up to me.

1063
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,280
Give them hell there, Danger.

1064
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:38,470
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1065
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,620
Hey, FIippy, come here for a minute.

1066
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:49,360
Jesus.

1067
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:52,220
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1068
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,830
Oh, God!

1069
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,530
Dumb-ass.

1070
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,370
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1071
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,940
Come on. Defense!

1072
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:07,870
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1073
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:10,580
...drinking mai tais...

1074
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,940
...Iooking at naked women.

1075
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,380
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1076
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,020
Danger, get out of there!

1077
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,230
Fight back! Come on!

1078
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,030
-There you go, Danger, there you go!
-Good job, man.

1079
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,230
Jab him with the Ieft.
Come on.

1080
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,640
Come on.

1081
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,280
Hey, come on now, FIip.

1082
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,580
-What you doing? Let him go.
-AII right. Okay.

1083
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,120
I got you. Come on, come on.

1084
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,250
It's all right.

1085
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,260
We don't need no corner trainer.

1086
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,800
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1087
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,870
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1088
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:04,160
You my man. You rock.

1089
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,270
Come on, FIip, man, you ain't done.

1090
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,200
You ain't even fight good yet.

1091
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,310
Anybody can Iose one fight.

1092
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,940
Anybody can Iose one, son.
You'II come back from this.

1093
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:15,770
You'II be champion of the world.

1094
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:18,210
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1095
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,880
I should have knowed.

1096
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:23,610
-Come on. We don't need to be talking.
-Let me help you.

1097
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:27,320
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1098
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,390
AII right.

1099
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:34,320
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1100
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:38,500
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1101
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,470
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1102
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:43,770
Come on, now.

1103
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:47,900
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1104
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,080
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1105
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,990
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1106
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,390
Keep going, man.

1107
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,290
AII right, man.

1108
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,130
He ain't so tough.

1109
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,410
One hundred and ten.

1110
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,980
Get a job, punk.

1111
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,420
Win this one, I'II tell you what it means.

1112
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,480
I got you some pipers.

1113
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:20,040
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1114
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:24,510
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1115
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,780
AII right, now!

1116
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,070
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1117
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,330
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1118
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:48,860
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...

1119
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:51,260
...presentation of the evening.

1120
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:55,990
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1121
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,230
...in the red corner.

1122
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,030
In the blue corner...

1123
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:04,540
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1124
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:07,580
...Billie "The BIue Bear."

1125
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,550
Sweet Jesus.

1126
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:31,730
Fitzgerald is pushing The Blue Bear
around the ring. She's coming on strong.

1127
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:37,630
Challenger darts in, Iands a combination
to the head and the body.

1128
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:39,940
-And a right hook stuns the champ.
-AII right.

1129
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,280
Break it up!

1130
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,220
Break it! Break it!

1131
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:57,130
Do that one more time,
it'II cost you a point, do you hear me?

1132
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,590
Go fight.

1133
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:10,400
You motherfucker.

1134
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:21,020
Come on. What the fuck?

1135
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:23,920
AII right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1136
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,320
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1137
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,520
--comes back, hits Fitzgerald....

1138
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:31,130
Ref, open your eyes, you....

1139
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:52,880
Ladies and gentlemen, the first round
is in the books on this championship match.

1140
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:58,790
-Hold onto that.
-There you go.

1141
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,930
-Looking good.
-You pull that crap one more time...

1142
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,860
...you're disqualified.

1143
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:17,700
It's gonna be all right.

1144
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,610
Got no doubt, boss.

1145
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,040
Okay, just watch yourself.

1146
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,620
Stay away from this dame.

1147
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,790
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1148
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:46,130
-Four, five, six...
-Stay down, you bitch.

1149
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,710
...seven, eight, nine.

1150
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,120
Yeah, yeah!

1151
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:07,280
Break it! Break it!

1152
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,030
Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion....

1153
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:33,510
Yes! Come on!

1154
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,250
I got it! I got it.

1155
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:43,390
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1156
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,330
-How many eyes you need to finish this?
-One's enough.

1157
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:51,390
-Good.
-Now...

1158
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:53,090
...what do I do about the Bear?

1159
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:56,210
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the Iiver?

1160
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:59,970
-I been doing that. She's made of steel.
-I don't want you to go to the Iiver.

1161
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:03,080
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1162
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,310
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1163
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,580
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1164
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,720
-What about the ref?
-Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1165
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,650
...and everything will just be fine.

1166
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,690
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1167
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,420
You keep it up.

1168
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:34,380
Oh, yeah!

1169
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,020
Break, break!

1170
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:57,490
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1171
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,770
Doctor.

1172
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:44,780
Come on.

1173
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:46,670
Breathe.

1174
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:49,410
That's it. Breathe.

1175
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:51,510
Good.

1176
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:53,210
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1177
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:55,220
Breathe.

1178
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:57,420
Good.

1179
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,230
That's it.

1180
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:01,830
Breathe.

1181
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:52,080
How you feeling, darling?

1182
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,890
Growing a beard, boss?

1183
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:06,560
I thought it might help me
with the Iadies.

1184
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,760
Can't say it does.

1185
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,530
Does it--? Does it hurt much?

1186
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,530
Don't hurt at all.

1187
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:48,100
Well, that's good.

1188
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:55,370
Where's Frankie?

1189
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,920
Well, he's....

1190
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,480
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1191
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:04,750
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1192
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:11,360
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1193
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:19,300
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'II never be able to fix it.

1194
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,540
Gonna be frozen Iike this
the rest of my Iife.

1195
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,420
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1196
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:45,850
Did you see the fight?

1197
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:50,130
Of course I did.

1198
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,100
You had her cold, Maggie.

1199
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:57,700
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1200
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,740
I shouldn't have turned.

1201
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,590
AIways protect myself.

1202
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,890
How many times he tell me that?

1203
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,490
Yeah...

1204
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,730
...he does Iike to repeat himself.

1205
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,840
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1206
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,340
No.

1207
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,310
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1208
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,030
Damnedest thing.

1209
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,640
So, what's the plan?

1210
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:08,810
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1211
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,740
It's your fault.

1212
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:14,340
Yeah, it's your fault
she's Iying in there Iike that.

1213
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,490
You kept after me until I trained her.

1214
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:19,890
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1215
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:23,390
Everything kept telling me not to.

1216
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,320
Everything but you.

1217
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:37,430
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1218
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:39,580
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1219
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:42,710
Otherwise, why would they be
Iiving out here in the desert?

1220
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,850
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1221
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:49,780
...we'II find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1222
01:37:52,690 --> 01:37:54,620
You just rest there, I'II....

1223
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:58,020
I'm on it.

1224
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,500
Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...

1225
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:12,470
...Iooking for somebody
who 'd tell him they could fix her.

1226
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:16,700
He came close twice,
till they checked her over...

1227
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:19,020
...said there was nothing to be done.

1228
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:22,750
Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.

1229
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:30,550
They got nurses for that, you know.

1230
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,260
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1231
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:50,710
She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn 't change positions.

1232
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,350
Thank you.

1233
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,670
They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.

1234
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:30,920
FIy there, drive back.

1235
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:40,720
The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.

1236
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,000
They took good care of Maggie.

1237
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,260
She wouldn 't have complained
if they hadn 't.

1238
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:50,500
Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1239
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:58,010
One, two, three, up.

1240
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,750
Since she couldn 't breathe on her own...

1241
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,550
...her respirators were always on.

1242
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:10,630
Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.

1243
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:40,190
Maggie 's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.

1244
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,990
She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.

1245
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,260
Sure.

1246
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:49,020
Frankie finally tracked them down.

1247
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:53,190
Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.

1248
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:56,740
Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.

1249
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,510
You don't have to hang around all day.

1250
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,310
I Iike it here. I don't mind.

1251
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:15,010
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1252
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:20,860
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1253
01:41:21,230 --> 01:41:23,030
Well, it's no burden.

1254
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:25,400
Here.

1255
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,740
Read this.

1256
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,980
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1257
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:41,920
That's terrible.

1258
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:47,410
Anyway, I'II tell you in English
what you were saying.

1259
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:51,790
It says:

1260
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:55,520
I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree

1261
01:41:55,700 --> 01:42:00,230
And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made

1262
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:05,540
And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow

1263
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:10,840
Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.

1264
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,620
Not bad, huh?

1265
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,280
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1266
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,790
-Me?
-Yeah.

1267
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,890
You know, when you quit all this.

1268
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:32,500
You mean boxing?

1269
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:35,700
No, I'II never quit.

1270
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:39,200
I Iike the stink too much, I guess.

1271
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,610
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1272
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:50,150
...with your books and Iemon pie.

1273
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,220
How about you?
Would you Iike to go Iive in a cabin?

1274
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,530
I could Iearn how to bake.

1275
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:04,990
Well, then, I'II....

1276
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:07,330
Maybe I'II start Iooking then.

1277
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:30,550
Yeah.

1278
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:35,730
-Go ahead.
-AII right. Okay, sounds good.

1279
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,040
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1280
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:43,500
Where's my Iittle girl?

1281
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:46,510
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1282
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,440
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1283
01:43:49,610 --> 01:43:53,070
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1284
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:56,010
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

1285
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:57,590
There's some rides you missed.

1286
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,420
Why don't you go back.
I'II tell her you couldn't make it.

1287
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:02,860
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1288
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:05,190
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1289
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,020
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

1290
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,170
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1291
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,900
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1292
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:15,070
Right down here, 301.

1293
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:17,070
-Come on, Mama.
-Let's go.

1294
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,670
And I saw myself breathing.

1295
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,710
Like, my body was going up and down.

1296
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:30,720
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me? "

1297
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:37,060
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1298
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:52,510
It's just a....

1299
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:55,600
It's just some kind of Iegal thing.

1300
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:57,110
What is it?

1301
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,340
How we all doing here?

1302
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,040
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a Iot of time.

1303
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:06,380
Mr. Johnson's charging us a Iot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1304
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,190
Why don't you just Ieave that.
I'II read it to her Iater.

1305
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,920
Hey, old man...

1306
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:12,560
...you part of our family?

1307
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,160
Stay the hell out of this.

1308
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,500
Read it to me, Mama.

1309
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:22,230
Well, it's just something Iegal
to protect your money.

1310
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:24,530
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1311
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:28,810
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1312
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:31,310
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1313
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:34,320
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1314
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:37,650
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1315
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:39,650
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1316
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:43,450
-Nothing.
-Yeah, Iook, why don't you just Ieave it.

1317
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:47,500
-Then I'II just read it to her Iater on--
-With respect, this ain't your business.

1318
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,400
AII right. I'II be out in the hall.

1319
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:00,010
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1320
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:03,380
You sign that paper...

1321
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,870
...it'II take care of your family...

1322
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:08,410
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1323
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:15,180
How do you make your mark?

1324
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:18,920
Can you hold a pen?

1325
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,460
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1326
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:23,690
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1327
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,800
Here you go, honey.

1328
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,000
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1329
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,440
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1330
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:37,570
I did pretty good.

1331
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,610
You Iost, Mary M.

1332
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:44,250
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you Iost.

1333
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,620
Don't wanna Iose the rest
of what you got Ieft.

1334
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,620
There you go.

1335
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,840
What happened to you?

1336
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,870
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1337
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:09,150
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

1338
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:14,310
Before I tell that Iawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1339
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,720
...you never signed those house papers
Iike you were supposed to.

1340
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,960
So any time I feel Iike it,
I can sell that house...

1341
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:26,360
...from under your fat, Iazy,
hillbilly asses.

1342
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:31,730
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'II do.

1343
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:17,170
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 1 0.

1344
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:32,850
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1345
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,390
We might have to Iose it, Maggie.

1346
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:57,250
They took my Ieg, boss.

1347
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,590
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1348
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:08,820
I always hear your voice, boss.

1349
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:42,110
You need anything?

1350
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:48,520
I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.

1351
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:52,060
But you didn't win.

1352
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:54,570
I don't have to tell you.

1353
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:00,870
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1354
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,340
No wonder no one Ioves you.

1355
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:09,320
You remind me of my daddy.

1356
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,990
Well, he must have been...

1357
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:17,790
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1358
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:24,790
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1359
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,140
No, I was...

1360
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:32,540
...Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1361
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:37,180
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1362
01:51:37,610 --> 01:51:41,050
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1363
01:51:41,850 --> 01:51:44,820
I thought maybe you'd Iike
to go back to school.

1364
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:52,290
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1365
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:56,260
Sure.

1366
01:51:57,630 --> 01:51:59,630
Anything you want.

1367
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:04,310
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1368
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:19,660
Don't even think about that.

1369
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:25,960
I can't be Iike this, Frankie.

1370
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,960
Not after what I done.

1371
01:52:31,130 --> 01:52:33,130
I seen the world.

1372
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:38,400
People chanted my name.

1373
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,570
Well...

1374
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:46,000
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1375
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:51,490
But they were chanting for me.

1376
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:57,390
I was in magazines.

1377
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,930
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1378
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:12,000
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1379
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:19,040
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1380
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:24,750
...and I'd fight my way out.

1381
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:32,630
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1382
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,270
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1383
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,600
I got what I needed.

1384
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:48,070
I got it all.

1385
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:54,640
Don't Iet them keep
taking it away from me.

1386
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:04,680
Don't Iet me Iie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1387
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:11,930
I can't.

1388
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,730
PIease.

1389
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:19,260
PIease, don't ask me.

1390
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,470
I'm asking.

1391
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:28,950
I can't.

1392
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:14,820
Hello?

1393
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,270
In the middle of the night...

1394
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:25,430
...Maggie had found her own solution.

1395
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:28,170
She had bit her tongue.

1396
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:38,120
Stop. Stop.

1397
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:44,220
Look at me. Look at me.

1398
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:02,310
Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.

1399
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:07,120
She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.

1400
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:09,580
They stitched her up again...

1401
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:12,950
...padded the tongue
so she couldn 't bite.

1402
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:33,610
You can ' t do it, you know that.

1403
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:37,410
I do, Father.

1404
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:40,350
But you don't know how thick she is...

1405
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:43,040
...how hard it was to train her.

1406
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:47,350
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1407
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:52,990
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1408
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,930
How she fought for the title, I....

1409
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,620
It wasn't by anything....

1410
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:00,830
Well, it wasn't by Iistening to me.

1411
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:12,180
But now she wants to die...

1412
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:14,580
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1413
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:23,150
And I swear to God, Father, it's....

1414
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:26,490
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1415
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:30,060
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1416
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:33,490
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1417
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:37,670
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1418
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,780
You Ieave her with God.

1419
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:44,000
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1420
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:48,140
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1421
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:50,340
The only person comes
to church that much...

1422
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,180
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1423
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:54,720
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1424
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:57,690
...they're nothing compared to this.

1425
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:02,230
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1426
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,460
If you do this thing, you'II be Iost.

1427
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:11,200
Somewhere so deep...

1428
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:15,440
...you'II never find yourself again.

1429
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:24,050
I think I did it already.

1430
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:49,280
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1431
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,140
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1432
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,870
You must have been somewhere else.

1433
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:03,920
Yeah.

1434
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,850
You got a fight I don't know about?

1435
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:17,530
It wasn't your fault.

1436
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:20,090
I was wrong to say that.

1437
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:22,300
You're damn right.

1438
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:25,040
I found you a fighter...

1439
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:28,740
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

1440
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:32,780
I killed her.

1441
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:34,810
Don't say that.

1442
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:37,740
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1443
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,120
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

1444
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:44,690
A year and a half Iater, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1445
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:46,090
You did that.

1446
02:00:48,330 --> 02:00:50,860
People die every day, Frankie.

1447
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:52,900
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1448
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,170
And you know what
their Iast thought is?

1449
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,810
"I never got my shot."

1450
02:00:58,310 --> 02:01:00,610
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1451
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:05,540
If she dies today, you know what
her Iast thought will be?

1452
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:08,780
"I think I did all right."

1453
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:18,950
I know I could rest with that.

1454
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:22,690
Yeah.

1455
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:25,100
Yeah.

1456
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:37,840
Yeah.

1457
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,520
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1458
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:19,180
Yeah.

1459
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,740
AII right.

1460
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,390
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1461
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:57,520
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1462
02:03:02,230 --> 02:03:04,960
Then I'II give you a shot, and you'II...

1463
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:07,660
...stay asleep.

1464
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:14,770
Mo cuishle...

1465
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:19,910
...means "my darling, my blood."

1466
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:30,820
He gave her a single shot.

1467
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:35,420
It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.

1468
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,630
He didn 't want her
going through this again.

1469
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,170
Then he walked out.

1470
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:34,080
I don 't think he had anything left.

1471
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:54,870
I went back to the gym.

1472
02:05:55,170 --> 02:05:58,830
Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.

1473
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:21,900
And that's when a ghost
came through the door.

1474
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:27,490
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

1475
02:06:28,570 --> 02:06:30,230
What was that, Danger?

1476
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:34,440
Anybody can Iose one fight.

1477
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,510
That's the truth.

1478
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:40,910
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a Iot of training.

1479
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:45,350
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1480
02:07:04,170 --> 02:07:07,300
Frankie never came back at all.

1481
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:26,260
Frankie didn 't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.

1482
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:29,120
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...

1483
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:32,290
...and ask you one more time
to forgive him.

1484
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:35,900
But maybe he didn 't have
anything left in his heart.

1485
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,440
I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.

1486
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:43,000
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1487
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:46,580
Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.

1488
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:50,310
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1489
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:52,810
No matter where he is...

1490
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:58,090
...I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.

1491
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,160
