1
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,270
百万美元宝贝

2
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,460
加油
Do it!

3
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,970
你能打败他! 你能打败他!
You got him! You got him!

4
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,390
我只遇见过一个我不想和他争斗的人
I only ever met one man I wouldn't wanna fight.

5
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,160
我止不了血
I can't stop that.

6
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,130
滚开吧 你个没有的东西
Get out of here, you useless tit.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,270
我遇见他的时候 他已经是拳击界最好的伤口护理师
When I met him, he was already the best cut man in the business.

8
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,670
你能止住吗?
Can you stop it?

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,570
从60年代起就开始做训练师和经理人
Started training and managing in the '60s.

10
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,170
一直保持着高昂的热情
But he never lost his gift.

11
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,930
不行
No.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,380
我来看看他
Let me have a look at him.

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,210
他没事 他没事
He's fine. He's fine.

14
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,680
如果你止不了血的话就不是没事
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,460
我再给你一个回合
I'll give you one more round.

16
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,530
- 时间到了 来吧 - 我们怎么办?告诉我怎么办
- Seconds out. Let's go. - What do we do? Tell me what to do.

17
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,730
你让他打你
You let him hit you.

18
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,970
有时你就是无能为力
Sometimes there's just nothing you can do.

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,300
伤口太深 离骨头太近
Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.

20
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,070
也许是断了一条血管...
Maybe you got a severed vein...

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,980
或者你就是无法让止血药深入里面
...or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,590
- 加油! - 分开 分开
- Come on! - Break. Break.

23
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,420
在肌肉的不同层次
There are all kinds of combinations you come up against...

24
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,820
你会遇到各种不同的问题组合
...down in the different layers of meat...

25
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,890
而弗兰基全都知道如何解决
...and Frankie knew how to work every one.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,700
- 对!加油! - 你在做什么?
- That's it! Come on! - What are you doing?

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,100
打倒他 威利!
Knock him out, Willie!

28
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,550
人们热爱暴力
People love violence.

29
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,120
他们会在车祸现场减慢车速查看死尸
They'll slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies.

30
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,560
就是这些人宣称他们热爱拳击
Same people claim to love boxing.

31
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,060
他们根本不了解拳击是什么
They got no idea what it is.

32
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,720
拳击是有关尊严
Boxing is about respect.

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,730
赢得你自己的...
Getting it for yourself...

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,240
同时剥夺对手的
...and taking it away from the other guy.

35
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,610
我先去发动车
I'll warm up the car.

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,210
邓先生?
Mr.Dunn?

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,380
我欠你钱?
I owe you money?

38
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,810
没有 先生
No, sir.

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,470
我认识你妈妈?
I know your mama?

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,780
这个我确实不知道 先生
Don't rightly know, sir.

41
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,420
- 那你想干什么? - 我参加了垫场赛
- Then what is it you want? - I was on the undercard.

42
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,180
而且我也赢了 我是麦琪·菲斯杰拉德
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,920
那么 麦琪·菲斯杰拉德 有什么事吗?
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

44
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,450
- 你有没有正好看了我的比赛? - 没有
- Did you happen to see it? - Nope.

45
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,060
我干的不错
I did pretty good.

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,720
我想你也许有兴趣训练我
Thought you might be interested in training me.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,630
我不训练女孩子
I don't train girls.

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,260
也许你应该试试看 我打过的人都说我很凶狠
Maybe you should. People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

49
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,310
小姐 光是凶狠并不够
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

50
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,330
这是个错误
It's a mistake.

51
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,660
车应该能向后退的 弗兰基
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

52
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,330
帮我推一下 行不?
Just push, will you?

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,130
- 霍根有什么事? - 邀请我们参加头衔战
- What did Hogan want? - Offered us a title shot.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,170
是时候了
About time.

55
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,310
我直接把他拒绝了
I turned him down flat.

56
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,910
再多打两三场比赛 你就准备充分了
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

57
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,380
好久以前就说是两三场比赛了 弗兰基
Been two or three more fights for a long time now, Frankie.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,950
听着 威利 你只有一次机会赢得冠军
Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.

59
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
输掉的话 可能就再没有机会了
You lose it, it may not come around again.

60
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,130
再多打两三场比赛 我们就准备充分了
Now, two or three more fights and we'll be ready.

61
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,960
都听你的 弗兰基
Whatever you say, Frankie.

62
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,960
弗兰基总喜欢说 拳击是一种不自然的运动
Frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act...

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,240
因为拳击中的每样东西都是逆向的
...that everything in boxing is backwards.

64
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,470
有时...
Sometimes...

65
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,380
打出一记重拳的最好方法是退后一步
...best way to deliver a punch is step back.

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,820
我的主啊 请尽力...
Well, do your best, Lord...

67
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,190
保护凯蒂
...protect Katy.

68
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,860
还有安妮
Annie too.

69
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,320
至于其他的...
Other than that...

70
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,470
你知道我想要什么 所以我再重复也没有什么用
...you know what I want, there's no use me repeating myself.

71
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,500
但是退后太多 你就已经退出比赛了
But step back too far, you ain't fighting at all.

72
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,360
（圣马可教堂）

73
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,090
- 再见 - 再见
- Bye. - Bye.

74
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,890
神父 布道很精彩 让我流泪
Father, that was a great sermon. Made me weep.

75
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,530
你这周又有什么疑惑?
What's confusing you this week?

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,170
噢 就是那个老掉牙的三位一体的问题
Oh, it's the same old one- God- three- God thing.

77
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,370
弗兰基 大多数人幼儿园的时候
Frankie, most people figure out...

78
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,570
就知道一切都是信心的问题
...by kindergarten it's about faith.

79
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,830
是不是有点像三种不一样的萨其马
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle...

80
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,230
都装在一个大盒子里?
...and Pop all rolled up in one big box?

81
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,610
你站在我的教堂外面把上帝比做点心?
You're standing outside my church comparing God to Rice Krispies?

82
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,550
你来做弥撒的唯一原因就是要骚扰我
The only reason you come to Mass is to wind me up.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,780
- 不过今天不会了 - 我有点迷惑
- It won't happen this morning. - I'm confused.

84
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,250
- 不 你没有 - 不 我有
- No, you aren't. - Yes, I am.

85
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,620
那好 我给你的答案是 只有一位上帝
Then here's your answer: There's one God.

86
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,260
还有事吗? 我很忙
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

87
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,260
- 那么圣灵呢? - 他是上帝的爱的一种表现形式
- What about the Holy Ghost? - He's an expression of God's love.

88
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,020
- 耶稣呢? - 上帝之子 别在这儿装傻了
- And Jesus? - Son of God. Don't play stupid.

89
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,570
那么他是什么呢? 上帝的儿子意味着半神半人?
What is he then? Does that make him a demigod?

90
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,100
没有半神半人 操他妈的异教徒!
There are no demigods, you fucking pagan!

91
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,450
- 给你女儿写信了么? - 当然
- Did you write your daughter? - Absolutely.

92
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,170
你这是对一个神父撒谎
Now you're lying to a priest.

93
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,910
跟你说吧 休息一天 明天别来了
You know what? Take a day off, don't come to Mass tomorrow.

94
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,580
（斗场拳击馆）

95
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,760
有些人会说对于一个拳手来说
Some people would say the most...

96
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,460
最重要的莫过于热情
...important thing a fighter can have is heart.

97
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,470
弗兰基则会说 给我一个只有热情的拳手...
Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart...

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,800
我会告诉他什么叫鼻青脸肿
...and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating."

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,580
我想我只见过一个全心投入的拳手
Think I only ever met one fighter who was all heart.

100
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,450
我的名号是"战斗小子" 丹吉尔·迪拉德·巴奇...
My name's Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam- Bam Barch...

101
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,490
来自德克萨斯布劳德县!
...out of Broward County, T exas!

102
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,060
丹吉尔是几年前来的
Danger showed up a couple of years back.

103
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,930
他和他妈妈的新男友艾瑞威尔 一起到洛杉矶来
He'd come visiting L.A. With Ervel, his mama's new boyfriend.

104
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,370
似乎艾瑞威尔迷了路 自己回德克萨斯
Apparently Ervel got lost and ended up back in Texas.

105
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,140
在来这里以前 丹吉尔找了他大概一个星期
Danger looked for him for about a week before he introduced himself.

106
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,050
你知道么 我对黑鬼从来没有任何偏见
Hey, you know, I gots nothing against niggers.

107
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,490
真高兴听你这么说
Well, that's nice to hear.

108
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,910
我的家乡很多人确实是那样...
Yeah, lots of people where I comes from does...

109
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,670
但是我妈妈告诉我不要伤害任何人...
...but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man...

110
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,570
不管是不是黑鬼
...niggers or not.

111
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,330
你妈妈还真是个好人 我可以帮你点什么嘛?
You got a nice mama. Anything else I can do for you?

112
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,760
你也许只是随便问个问题 ...
Just one of those questions you ask...

113
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,090
但是丹吉尔总想给你最好的答案
...but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.

114
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,670
我想成为次中量级世界冠军
Well, sir, I'd likes to become the welterweight champion of the world.

115
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,440
我要挑战"城市机动眼镜蛇"...
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

116
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,300
还有"刺客"汤马斯 赫尔斯...
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,560
争夺次中量级世界冠军!
...to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world!

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,790
冒失鬼 闭嘴 你连排名都没有
Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.

119
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,340
你最少要打一场比赛才能有排名
You gotta have at least one fight to be ranked.

120
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,110
我可以和任何人打 随时!
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

121
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,940
你是个坏蛋 是吗?
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

122
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,560
进绳圈里来 我陪你玩一回合
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

123
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,470
- 谢瑞尔 - 没问题
- Shawrelle. - I will.

124
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,010
别理他
Leave him alone.

125
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,470
丹吉尔 你继续训练
Danger, you go on back to training.

126
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,340
我会的 斯科雷普先生
Will do, Mr.Scrap.

127
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,720
你的紧身裤不错
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

128
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,500
我以后再揍你的屁股 小妞
I'll give you that ass- whupping later, Olive Oyl.

129
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,900
你的裤子还真不赖 丹吉尔
Hey, bro, those pants look real pretty on you.

130
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,730
把他妈妈的紧身衣还给她吧
Give his mama back her tights.

131
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,920
谢瑞尔·贝里的左钩拳可以打飞一辆坦克...
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook that would move a tank...

132
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,150
但是他的心胸却像豆子一样小
...but he had a heart the size of a split pea.

133
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,280
弗兰基17年前从巴比·马龙手里买下了斗场拳击馆
Frankie bought the Hit Pit from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.

134
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,070
巴比想搬到佛罗里达去 而弗兰基想要生活有点保障
Bobby wanted to move to Florida, and Frankie wanted some security.

135
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,030
巴比在他收拾行李的时候死掉了
Bobby died while he was packing.

136
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,060
弗兰基那时候才发现 大多数拳击馆都亏钱
And Frankie found out most gyms lose money.

137
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,280
我想我已经告诉过你 别让丹吉尔继续训练下去了
I thought I told you I didn't want Danger working out here anymore.

138
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,510
他又不会伤害到别人 弗兰基
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

139
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,070
他伤害到我了
Well, he's hurting me.

140
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,260
我看着心疼 看他朝着空气挥拳
Breaking my heart, watching him punch the air...

141
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
好像空气会反击一样
...like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

142
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,060
还有我告诉你多少次了 漂白液就是漂白液
And how many times have I gotta tell you that bleach is bleach?

143
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,820
你就不能买便宜点的么?
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?

144
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,820
不用买贵的那种
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

145
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,020
这种更好闻一些 弗兰基
It smells better, Frankie.

146
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,170
漂白液闻起来还是漂白液
Bleach smells like bleach.

147
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,390
- 斯科雷普 - 威利先生
- Hey, Scrap. - Hey, Mr.Willie.

148
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,680
昨晚打得不错
Hey, nice fight last night.

149
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,800
打得不错
Nice fight.

150
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,790
- 大个子威利 - 赛利
- Big Willie. - Hey, Sally.

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,830
- 打得不错 - 谢了 兄弟
- Nice fight. - Thanks, man.

152
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,400
有人在谈话
People are talking.

153
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,670
这他妈的是什么语言?
What the hell kind of language is that?

154
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,540
你想干吗?
What do you want?

155
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,710
我想你可能想知道 你有一个拳手...
I thought you might like to know you got a fighter out there...

156
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,360
不跟别的经理人说话
...not talking to another manager.

157
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,170
不跟别的经理人说话?
Not talking to another manager?

158
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,730
不是随便什么经理人
And not just any manager.

159
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,500
米奇·麦克
Mickey Mack.

160
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,260
你进来就是为了跟我说
You came in here to tell me that...

161
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
大个子威利不跟米奇·麦克说话
...Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

162
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,250
他们两个人一个字都没说
Not a word. Neither one of them.

163
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,730
我正打算读书
I'm trying to read here.

164
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,920
好吧 如果你觉得读书更重要
Well, if you think that's more important.

165
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,730
新来的那个女孩是谁?
Who's your new girl?

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,660
什么?
What?

167
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,520
我的老天
Jesus Christ.

168
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,030
最好快点
Better hurry up.

169
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,740
她要继续这么打沙袋 手腕迟早会断
She keeps hitting it like that, she gonna break her wrists.

170
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,270
你在浪费时间 我告诉过你我不训练女人
You're wasting your time. I told you I don't train girls.

171
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,510
我想你也许会改变主意
Thought you might change your mind.

172
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,280
外面有至少一打训练师训练女人 找到一个很容易
Dozens of trainers train girls. You won't have any trouble finding one.

173
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,950
我不需要一打 老板 您一个就会很好
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

174
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,340
别叫我老板
Don't call me boss, now.

175
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,740
我不是你老板 你别再这么叫了
I'm not your boss, and don't you be calling me that.

176
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,300
- 威利 你准备好了么? - 随时可以开始
- Willie, you ready to work? - Anytime.

177
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,370
如果我不叫你老板 你会训练我么?
If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?

178
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,060
不会
No.

179
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,780
那我还是继续这样叫您好了
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

180
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,470
她从密苏里州西南部来...
She came from southwestern Missouri...

181
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,910
欧扎克地区的小城镇 西奥多西亚城外的山上...
...the hills outside the scratch- ass Ozark town of Theodosia...

182
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,930
一个雪松和橡树环绕 比偏僻更偏僻的地方
...set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

183
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,830
在成长的过程中她只知道一件事 自己是个垃圾
She grew up knowing one thing: She was trash.

184
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,610
是给我的狗的
It's for my dog.

185
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,840
尽管她可以跋涉1800英里 西奥多西亚还是就在那山上
She'd come 1800 miles, but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

186
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,040
我在打沙袋 老板
Working the bag, boss.

187
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,940
我不是你的老板 还有 是沙袋在打你
I'm not your boss. And that bag's working you.

188
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,920
把钱退给她
Give her her money back.

189
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,510
你确定?
You sure?

190
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,690
- 她付了多少钱? - 六个月的
- How much did she pay? - Six months.

191
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,720
- 我的老天 - 我去还给她
- Jesus Christ. - No, I'll give it back.

192
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,330
不 别装聪明了 好吗?
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

193
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,130
这女人一定会觉得咱们为了赶她走...
Woman thinks I'll throw away six months' worth of dues...

194
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,540
连六个月的费用都不要 她肯定会发疯的
...just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

195
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,650
- 但是千万别鼓励她 明白了么? - 好
- But just don't encourage her, understand? - Okay.

196
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,810
丹吉尔在外面做什么? 他在看什么?
And what's Danger doing out there? What's he looking at?

197
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,550
好像是一瓶水
Looks like a bottle of water.

198
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,020
他付费了么?
He paid his dues?

199
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,700
费用? 他连裤子都买不起 你想让他付训练费?
Dues? Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?

200
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,800
出去吧
Get out of my office.

201
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,770
我操
Fuck me.

202
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,460
你不能把它当做沙袋
Can't think of it as a bag.

203
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,800
我虽然不是训练师
I'm not a trainer...

204
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,800
但是如果你愿意的话我可以示范一下
...but I can show you this if you'd like.

205
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,430
任何帮助我都会感激您
Appreciate any help I can get.

206
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,560
你要做的是 你要把它看成是一个人 明白吗?
What you wanna do is, you wanna think of it as a man, see?

207
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,030
他在不停地移动
And he's constantly moving.

208
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,680
冲着你 绕着你 远离你 明白吗?
He's moving towards you, around you, away from you. All right?

209
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,190
不要在他向你移动的时候击打他
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you...

210
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,390
因为他会把你向后推...
...because he's just gonna push you back...

211
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,890
化解你的击打让你失去平衡 对吗?
...he's gonna smother your punches and take your balance, right?

212
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,910
所以你要小心的注视他
So you watch him real carefully.

213
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,390
不停转动 这样你的头就一直在动
Keep rotating. That keeps your head moving.

214
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,290
一个肩膀放在后侧 这样你随时可以打出一记重拳
And keep one shoulder back so you're always ready to fire a power shot.

215
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,230
对吗?来 好 好 不停旋转 不停移动 好
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good. Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

216
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
好 下巴收住
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

217
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,880
继续 不停移动 不停移动
Come on around. Keep moving, keep moving.

218
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,710
- 好 好 好 - 像这样?
- Good, good, good. - Like that?

219
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,310
对 给它几下
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

220
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,910
下巴收住 下巴收住
Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.

221
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,890
非常好 很好
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

222
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,850
等练完这个 我们就安排你打梨球
Now, you get this down, we'll put you on the speed bag.

223
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,830
你有梨球吧
You do have a speed bag.

224
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,470
我有钱买自己的之前先借用一下
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

225
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,240
好 那你回家吧
All right, you go on home now.

226
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,280
- 我和你一起出去? - 不用 这里就是我家
- I'll walk out with you? - No, I am home.

227
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,650
- 想看看吗?
- Wanna see? - Yeah.

228
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,930
挺好的
It's nice.

229
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,960
我再打一会儿会不会打扰您?
Would it bother you if I worked a little longer?

230
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,490
不会 走的时候把门关好就行了
No, just pull the door closed when you leave.

231
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,510
谢谢
Thank you.

232
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,380
如果拳击运动中有诀窍的话...
If there's magic in boxing...

233
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,190
那么这种诀窍就是不停战斗 超越耐力的极限...
...it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance...

234
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,660
超越折断的肋骨 破裂的肾脏 和脱落的视网膜
...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas.

235
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,610
这种诀窍是 为了别人无法了解的梦想而赌上一切
It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.

236
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,330
好了 好了 伙计们 看好脚步
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

237
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,360
对了 对了
Hey, that's it. That's it.

238
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,430
手举起来
Hands up.

239
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,430
刺 刺 刺
Jab, jab, jab.

240
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,880
冒失鬼
Hey, Flip.

241
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,860
冒失鬼 过来
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

242
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,950
我想我找到一个你能打败的人
I think I found somebody you can beat.

243
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,190
我不和女人打
I don't fights women.

244
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,370
为什么不 兄弟? 太合适你了 你知道为什么吗?
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro, because you know why?

245
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,170
因为她... 就像你 你可以和他打...
Because she... Like, you, you could fight to him...

246
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,010
然后可以亲亲他
...and then you could kiss to him.

247
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,040
然后你还可以再跟他打一次
Then you fight to him one more time.

248
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,880
听起来真美啊 哥们儿 像一首诗
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

249
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,350
- 像一首诗 - 你他妈墨水不少啊
- It's like poetry. - You been reading and shit.

250
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,150
- 谢了兄弟 - 伙计 这是个女人?
- Thanks, bro. - That's a girl, man?

251
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,990
冒失鬼 我想你是对的
Flip, I think you right.

252
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,690
看看她的小奶子 就像蚊子咬的包
Look at her little bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

253
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,520
靠 含着一嘴不满 让我看看
Man, that's barely even a mouthful. Let me see.

254
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,320
我看了你上一场比赛 谢瑞尔
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

255
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,730
大多数时间脸都朝下 我还以为地板长了奶子呢
Spent so much time face down, I thought the canvas had titties.

256
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:02,500
地板长了奶子 看看我 我是谢瑞尔
Canvas has titties. Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

257
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,550
跟拳台做啊 跟地板做啊
Just humping the canvas. Humping the floor.

258
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,640
靠 兄弟 地板长了奶子? 挺搞笑的 兄弟
Come on, bro. The floor having titties? That's funny, bro.

259
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,150
闭嘴吧你 你们笑什么呢
Shut up, man. What you laughing at?

260
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,020
哥们儿 扶住沙袋 傻瓜
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

261
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,630
那边有奶子啊 哥们儿
Some titties right there, man.

262
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,310
冒失鬼 他们什么时候开始做男式紧身裤了?
Yo, when they start making those tights for men, Flippy?

263
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,360
废物
Punk.

264
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,470
好了 足够了 今天足够了
All right, that's enough. That's enough for the day.

265
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,620
- 我给你按摩一下 - 噢 我没时间 弗兰基
- I'll give you a rubdown. - Oh, I can't, Frankie.

266
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,860
孩子有钢琴课 我跟格蕾斯说我去送她
Middle one's got a piano lesson. I told Grace I'd drive her.

267
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,130
- 格蕾斯的车坏了? - 她讨厌那辆车
- Something wrong with Gracie's car? - She hates that car.

268
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,600
想把那辆旧车要回来 可是卖车的说他已经有买家了
Wants the old one back, but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

269
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,780
我也许应该和卖车的谈谈
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

270
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,300
那我真是感激不尽
I'd appreciate that.

271
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,810
好吧
Okay.

272
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,090
- 谢谢 - 回头见
- Thanks. - See you later.

273
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,310
那家伙按摩成瘾 今天他不想按摩
The man's a rubdown whore. Today he doesn't want one.

274
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,270
你在这里到底干不干活?
You ever do any work around here?

275
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,740
如果我是你的话 就不会操心我是不是干活
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

276
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,080
小姑娘看起来有进步啊
Little girl seems to be coming along.

277
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,220
是啊 看起来好像甚至有人在训练她
Yeah. It's almost like someone's been helping her.

278
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,190
也许她就是天生的 看起来她还有两把刷子
She might just be a natural. Looks like she's got something.

279
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,460
她还有我的梨球 她有的就这么多
She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.

280
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,030
我想知道她是怎么弄到的
I wonder how the hell she got that.

281
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,100
我也想知道
I wonder.

282
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,740
我想要拿回我的梨球
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

283
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,440
- 这个? - 没错 它是我的
- This bag? - Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

284
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,460
如果你在这里打它 别人会认为我在训练你
And if you're hitting it, people will think I'm training you.

285
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,190
老板 这件事就这么糟糕么?
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

286
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,320
对 对 没错
Yes. Yes, it is.

287
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,690
你每碰一次这个球 我就损失一些生意
Every time you touch it, you're losing me business out here.

288
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,530
我得承认 我在这儿是丢人现眼
- I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself. - Yeah.

289
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,970
你知道 我不能把这个随便借给别人
Well, I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.

290
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,870
我理解
I understand.

291
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,910
你看起来是个不错的女孩
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

292
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,040
- 我可以给你些建议么? - 感激不尽
- Can I give you some advice? - I'd appreciate that.

293
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,780
你可以在这里或者其他地方...
You'll find a trainer in this gym or somewhere else...

294
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,030
找到愿意训练女孩的训练师
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

295
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,390
简直就像是马戏表演
It's the latest freak show out there.

296
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,970
问题是 他们只会浪费你的时间...
The trouble is, they're gonna be wasting your time...

297
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,160
因为你已经太老了
...because you're too old.

298
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,470
我不觉得我那么老了
I don't feel that old.

299
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,830
这个嘛 我也不觉得我老
Well, neither do I...

300
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,530
但是你看我还会和21岁的人打拳么?
...but you don't see me fighting 21- year- olds, do you?

301
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,200
训练一个拳击手要四年
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

302
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,470
你多大了?
How old are you?

303
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,150
- 在下个生日之前31岁 - 对呀 你看看
- Thirty- one until my next birthday. - Oh, well, there you go.

304
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,200
31岁了
Thirty- one.

305
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,730
你不会从31岁才开始练芭蕾舞 不是么?
You wouldn't start training to be a ballerina at 31, would you?

306
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,030
我已经练了大概三年了
Already been working it for three years.

307
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,870
那你连梨球都打不到? 你到底怎么训练的?
And you can't hit a speed bag? What kind of training is that?

308
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,050
从来没有人指导 老板
Never had any, boss.

309
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,150
我不想说 可是能看出来
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

310
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,680
但是必须有人跟你说实话
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

311
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,680
我讨厌自己是那个说实话的人
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

312
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,000
对不起用了您的球 邓先生
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr.Dunn.

313
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,910
- 你现在不会哭吧? - 不会 先生
- You're not gonna cry now, are you? - No, sir.

314
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,040
好吧
Yeah.

315
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,710
给
Here.

316
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,950
- 这个该死的东西你留着吧 - 不 你需要它
- Keep the goddamn thing. - No, you need it.

317
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,250
不 拿着吧
No, take the bag.

318
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,250
反正我都二十年没见过它了
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

319
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,820
我还有三个 好好享受它 好吗?
I've had three since then. Just enjoy it, will you?

320
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,960
- 我只是在自己买之前暂时借用一下
- I'll just borrow it till I buy my own. - Yeah.

321
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,570
别丢了就行
Just don't lose it.

322
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,380
对 我知道 霍根...
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

323
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,350
你的拳手是冠军 所以我们不能对半分...
...your guy's the champ, so we don't split 50s...

324
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,510
但是如果我连四成...
...but if I don't see 40 percent...

325
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,160
听着 你同意六四开的时候再给我电话
Look, you call me back when it's 60- 40...

326
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
要不然就别打来了
...or don't call me back at all.

327
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,740
- 威利 - 弗兰基
- Hey, Willie. - Hey, Frankie.

328
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,510
出什么事情了么?
Something wrong?

329
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,970
对不起我就这么来找您
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.

330
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,870
我知道你不喜欢别人来串门
I know you don't like people dropping in.

331
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,410
你可不是外人 威利 什么时候来我都欢迎 进来吧
Oh, you're not people, Willie. You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

332
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,120
我是来谢谢您帮格蕾斯把车拿回来
I wanted to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.

333
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
你不用谢我
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

334
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,820
为自己的车多花1000美元 也不算帮什么忙
Paying an extra thousand dollars for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

335
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,560
格蕾斯看见那辆车的时候都哭了
Gracie cried when she saw it.

336
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,690
真的?
Really?

337
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,790
我还想跟您谈谈业务上的事情
I also needed to talk with you about business.

338
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,790
对了 我刚和霍根通了电话
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan.

339
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,990
我们连九月份的冠军赛都谈好了
We're all set for September.

340
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,000
除了分成的问题
Everything but the split.

341
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,030
我得离开你了 弗兰基
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

342
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,540
什么?
What?

343
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,240
威利 再打两场就到冠军赛了
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

344
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,750
不是这个问题 是...
It ain't that, it's...

345
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,650
就好像你说的 我只有一次机会
It's like you said, I got one shot.

346
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:19,840
如果我赢了
If I win.

347
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,740
我就可以在我还能挣的时候挣尽可能多的钱
I gotta make as much as I can while I can.

348
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,690
我需要有人能帮我实现
I need somebody in the action who can make things happen.

349
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,490
而且我得在比赛前换经理人
And I gotta make the change before the fight.

350
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,070
他说必须让他带我去打冠军赛 他才会签下我
Only way this guy say he'd take me is if he took me to the title.

351
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,130
所以我给你安排冠军赛 然后他带你去参加
So I get you the title fight, and this guy takes you there?

352
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,530
他说必须这样
Only way he'd do it.

353
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,240
很抱歉 弗兰基 我知道你等冠军很久了
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long you waiting on a title.

354
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,930
我也希望能和你一起
I wish it could've been with me.

355
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,740
米奇·麦克是个生意人 他什么也教不了你
Mickey Mack's a businessman. He can't teach you nothing.

356
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,750
你已经教会了一切我需要知道的
You already taught me everything I need to know.

357
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,300
有些话人们永远都不愿意听
There's some things people just don 't want to hear.

358
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,710
我要挑战"城市机动眼镜蛇"
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra

359
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,910
还有"刺客"汤马斯 赫尔斯...
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

360
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,380
争夺次中量级世界冠军!
...to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world.

361
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,250
丹吉尔 我这个拳套不是白戴的
Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

362
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,420
只是练习一下我的步伐 斯科雷普先生
Just working on my footwork, Mr.Scrap.

363
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,130
丹吉尔 你打一拳 要不然就滚出去
Danger, you throw a punch or get the hell out of this gym.

364
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,970
丹吉尔 好好想想那一拳 我马上就回来
Danger, while you thinking about that punch, I'll be right back.

365
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,400
我想我会狠狠打那一拳 斯科雷普先生
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr.Scrap.

366
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,650
没人忍心告诉丹吉尔 赫尔斯好多年前就已经退休了
No one had the heart to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.

367
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,990
威利的事情我听说了
I heard about Willie.

368
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,330
非常无情 太无情了
That's cold. That's dead cold.

369
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,530
当然 要不是你年纪都这么大了 还不算太残酷
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so damn old.

370
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,610
至少我还能用两只眼睛看
Yeah, well, at least I can see through both eyes.

371
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,280
不过也没给你带来多少好处 不是吗?
Didn't do you a lot of good though, did it?

372
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,510
我还有这个训练馆
Well, I've got the gym.

373
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,080
我这个年纪也不用再训练拳手了
Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

374
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,740
威利告诉你原因了?
Willie tell you why?

375
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,820
是米奇 米奇有他的关系
It was Mickey. Mickey's got the connections.

376
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,320
这不是因为关系 这是因为你对他没有信心
Oh, it ain't about connections. It's about you not believing in him.

377
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,190
我发掘了他 在他身上花了八年的心血
Well, I found him, I stuck with him for eight years.

378
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,000
这叫我对他没信心?
How's that for not believing in him?

379
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,570
两年前你就可以让他去打冠军赛了 他是知道的
You could've got him a title fight two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

380
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,830
他能在你身边呆这么久 我都感到吃惊
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

381
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,170
这个嘛 去参加比赛
Well, getting there and...

382
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,270
和把腰带赢回家完全是两回事
...taking home the belt are two different things.

383
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,340
我应该怎么办 让他去参加赢不了的比赛?
What was I supposed to do, just put him in over his head?

384
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,840
不保护他?
Not protect him?

385
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,400
你是在保护他不让他拿冠军?
Oh, you were protecting him from the championship.

386
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,060
- 对 - 现在听起来合情合理了
- Yeah. - Well, now it makes sense.

387
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,890
那你又怎么样呢 斯科雷普?
Well, what about you, Scrap?

388
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,790
你的经理当时做了什么?
What did your manager do?

389
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,550
你曾经是多么优秀的拳手 比威利要棒
You were a hell of a fighter, better than Willie.

390
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,660
他给了你一场冠军赛 还是把你扔在那里...
He get you a title fight, or did he just bust you out...

391
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,630
让对手用拳头不停打你的头 直到把眼睛打没了?
...banging your head against other people's fists until you lost your eye?

392
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,600
至少我有个机会
I had my shot.

393
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,360
我去挥舞过我的拳头 没有人能说我没努力过
I went out swinging, and no man can say I didn't.

394
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
是啊 我记得
Yeah, well, I remember.

395
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,990
但是请不要因为
And excuse me if...

396
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,690
我不想让我的拳手下半辈子...
...I didn't want my fighter spending the second half of his life...

397
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,040
都在清扫别人吐在地上的口水而介意
...cleaning up other people's spit.

398
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,440
是啊
Yeah, right.

399
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,740
对 你是聪明人 你还学希腊语呢
Right, you're the smart one. You're the one learning Greek.

400
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,550
是高卢语
It's Gaelic.

401
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,860
你刚刚把自己参加 冠军争霸战的机会保护没了
Well, you just protected yourself out of a championship fight.

402
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,220
这句话用高卢语怎么说?
How do you say that in Gaelic?

403
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,760
抱歉
Sorry.

404
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,960
谢谢
Thanks.

405
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,270
冠军和大个子威利·琼斯 之间的较量继续进行...
The action continues as the champ is battling Big Willie Jones...

406
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,430
他被冠军用 连续的左右拳控制住了
...and commanding him with rights and lefts.

407
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,770
逼到了绳圈的边上 他在用左拳攻击...
Up against the ropes, he's hitting him with the left...

408
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,430
拳击是一种不自然的运动
Boxing is an unnatural act.

409
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,950
因为拳击中的每样东西都是逆向的
Because everything in it is backwards.

410
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,320
你想向左移动...
You wanna move to the left...

411
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,390
 不是向左迈步 而是右脚趾用力
...you don't step left, you push on the right toe.

412
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,530
向右移动的时候左脚趾用力
To move right, you use your left toe.

413
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,620
你要迎着痛苦而上 而不是...
Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do...

414
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,800
像有理智的人那样躲避
...you step into it.

415
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,660
大个子威利反击了
But Big Willie comes back.

416
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
天哪 他一记右手拳击中了卫冕拳王
Oh, my God, he hits the champ with a right hand.

417
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,350
卫冕拳王倒下了
And the champ is down.

418
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,820
女士们先生们 裁判正在数点
Ladies and gentleman, the ref is in for the count.

419
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,350
大个子威利·琼斯 成为了新的世界冠军
And Big Willie Jones is the new champion of the world.

420
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,150
今晚发生的一切令人难以置信...
It's unbelievable how this has taken place tonight...

421
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,220
不过朋友们 新的冠军产生了
...but there you have it, folks, a new champion.

422
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,890
拳击中的每样东西都是逆向的
Everything in boxing is backwards.

423
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,040
要芝士汉堡吗?
Want a cheeseburger?

424
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,010
- 你给我买了个芝士汉堡?
- You bought me a cheeseburger? - Yeah.

425
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,210
我从没见你给别人买过芝士汉堡
I never see you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

426
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,410
我点了 可我吃不了 你愿意吃么?
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it. You want it?

427
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,280
我猜地球又开始转了
Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.

428
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,970
- 你看比赛了么? - 看了
- You watch the fight? - Yeah, I watched it.

429
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,860
威利打的不错
Willie did good.

430
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,970
这就是你要说的?
That's what you've got to say?

431
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,360
威利赢了 不是吗? 他打的不错
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

432
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,140
我看出你正在改变自己 学着敞开心扉 很不错
I see you been working on yourself, learning to open up. That's good work.

433
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,130
你看了?
You watch it?

434
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,040
是啊 我有HBO台
Yeah, I got HBO.

435
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,700
你怎么可能看得起HBO?
Now, how can you afford HBO?

436
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,700
我从什么时候起就叫你省钱了?
How long have I been telling you to save your money?

437
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,400
从我和"台风"路易斯 强森...
Ever since I fought Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

438
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,390
在密西西比州图皮洛市的 俱乐部体育馆比赛以后
...at the Stadium Club in Tupelo, Mississippi.

439
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,620
- 真的? - 是的
- That true? - Yeah.

440
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,460
经理人跑路了 让我们自己搭车回家
Manager ran off and left you and me to hitch home.

441
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,930
你难道什么都不记得了么?
Don't you remember nothing?

442
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,560
我记得走到一半的时候 觉得自己要被私刑处死了
Well, I remember walking halfway and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

443
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,240
我记得你把口袋空空的我
I remember you leaving me with...

444
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,640
扔在那个加油站
...my dick in my hand behind that gas station.

445
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,180
是啊 我当时搭到一个便车
Yeah, well, I got a ride.

446
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
我一关上门那家伙就开走了
The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.

447
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,960
后来我不得不又往回走了两英里
I had to walk back two miles.

448
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,950
你的良心占了上风 这就是原因
Your conscience got the better of you, that's what.

449
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,860
那他妈是什么声音?
What the hell's that?

450
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,820
今天是她的生日
It's her birthday.

451
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,170
你的呼吸方法不对 这就是为什么你大口喘气
You're not breathing right. That's why you're panting.

452
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,620
今天是你生日 是吗?
So it's your birthday, huh?

453
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,320
那你多大了?
How old does that make you?

454
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,110
我32了 邓先生
I'm 32, Mr.Dunn.

455
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,850
我在这里庆祝 我又花了一年的时间洗盘子和当女招待
I'm celebrating that I spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing...

456
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,020
我从13岁就开始干这些了
...which is what I been doing since 13.

457
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,210
根据您的理论 我37岁之前打不出一记像样的拳...
And according to you, I'll be 37 before I can even throw a decent punch...

458
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,120
打了这个梨球一个月 一点进展也没有...
...which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere...

459
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,490
我现在认识到 上帝的现实也许就是这样
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

460
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,800
另外的现实是 我的哥哥在监狱里
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

461
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,580
我的妹妹假装 自己的一个孩子还活着 诈骗福利金
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her kids is still alive...

462
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,810
我爸爸死了 我妈有312磅重
...my daddy's dead, and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

463
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,800
如果我还有理智的话 我应该回家去
If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home...

464
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,680
找个二手的活动房屋 买个炸锅 再来点夹心饼干
...find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

465
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,420
问题是 这是唯一我喜欢做的事情
The problem is, this is the only thing I ever felt good doing.

466
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,000
如果对于拳击来说我太老了 那我就一无所有
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

467
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,660
这下你满意了吧?
That enough truth to suit you?

468
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,690
这是你的梨球?
This your speed bag?

469
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,300
把你的放在台子后面了 真希望能说那是我用坏的
Put yours behind the counter. Wish I could say I wore it out.

470
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,390
好了 停一下 停一下
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

471
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,690
我要教你几件事情 然后给你找个训练师
I'll show you a few things, and then we'll get you a trainer.

472
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,500
不用了 抱歉
No, sorry.

473
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,140
- 你还打算讨价还价? - 是的 先生
- You're in a position to negotiate? - Yes, sir.

474
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,720
是的 因为我知道如果你正确的训练我
Because I know if you train me right.

475
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,720
我会成为冠军
I'm gonna be a champ.

476
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,600
我见过你看着我的样子
I seen you looking at me.

477
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,710
- 是的 用怜悯的眼神 - 你不要这么说
- Yeah, out of pity. - Don't you say that.

478
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,140
你不要这么说 如果不是事实的话
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

479
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,030
我要的是训练师
I want a trainer.

480
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,110
我不要施舍 我也不要帮忙
I don't want charity, and I don't want favors.

481
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,580
如果你不感兴趣 那我还要继续庆祝
If you're not interested, then I got more celebrating to do.

482
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,710
停 停 停
Stop, stop, stop.

483
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,250
该死 停下来 你到底在做什么?
Goddamn it, stop. What the hell are you doing?

484
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,120
好吧
Okay.

485
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,570
如果我来教你...
If I'm gonna take you on...

486
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,230
- 你一定不会后悔的 - 听我说就行了
- You won't never regret it. - Look, just listen to me.

487
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,240
- 如果我来教你... - 我保证我会非常努力
- If I take you on... - I promise I'll work so hard.

488
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,810
天 这已经是个错误了
God, this is a mistake already.

489
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,410
我听着呢 老板
I'm listening, boss.

490
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,810
如果我来教你 你一句话也不要说 你不能对我有疑问
If I take you on, you don't say anything, you don't question me.

491
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,020
不要问我问题 除了"是 弗兰基"以外什么也不要说
You don't ask why, you don't say anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

492
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,290
还有我会试着忘记 你是个女孩这个事实
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact that you're a girl.

493
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,690
我就要求这么多
That's all I ask.

494
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,350
另外如果你受伤了别对我哭
And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

495
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,120
- 好的 - 我们一言为定
- Alrighty. - We got a deal.

496
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,470
没 还没有
No, not quite.

497
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,600
我教你怎么打拳
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

498
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,470
然后给你找个经理人 我就放手不管了
...then we'll get you a manager, and I'm off down the road.

499
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,240
- 我不想和你争 不过... - 别跟我争 我们就这么办
- I hate to argue with you, but... - Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

500
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,280
我会教你一切你需要知道的
I teach you all you need to know...

501
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,180
然后你自己去挣个一百万美元
...and you go off and make a million dollars.

502
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,280
我不管 被人打掉牙齿 我也不管
I don't care. You get your teeth knocked out, I don't care.

503
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,650
我不想听 这个东西就是这样
I don't wanna hear about it. That's just the way it's gonna be.

504
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,380
只有这样我才同意教你
It's the only way I'll do it.

505
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,790
好的
All right.

506
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,690
在训练场里我注意到一件事
Now, one of the things I've...

507
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,890
你从来不移动你的脚
...noticed around the gym is you never move your feet.

508
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,370
你总是呆呆的站在那里 你必须要移动你的脚
You stand there just flat- footed. You've gotta move your feet.

509
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,700
这是我将教会你最有用的东西之一
That's one of the best things I can teach you.

510
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,710
那么 你应该这么做
So here's what you do.

511
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,350
把自己...膝盖弯曲一点
You get yourself... Bend your knees a little bit.

512
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,410
摆好运动姿态 就好像你打算要打什么一样
Get in an athletic position. Look like you're gonna hit something.

513
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,660
- 怎么做 老板? - 就...打...梨球就行了
- Move them how, boss? - Just... Go... Hit the bag.

514
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,320
- 停 - 我做错什么了?
- Stop. - What'd I do wrong?

515
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,660
好 你做错了两件事情
Okay, you did two things wrong.

516
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,160
第一 你问了我一个问题 第二 你又问了一个问题
One is you asked a question, and two is you asked another question.

517
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,500
现在我要你做的 不是要打得多么狠
Now, what I want you to do, it's not about hitting it hard...

518
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,610
而是打得多么好 所以看着我
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

519
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,400
如果你愿意的话可以和我一起数
You can count with me if you want.

520
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,410
就是数数 数一的时候 我打一下球
It's just count. On a one- count, I hit right through the bag.

521
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,570
- 你能再示范一次么? - 数...
- Can you show me that again? - I just...

522
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,780
数一就行了 拜托
Just say "one," please.

523
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,440
- 一 - 好
- One. - Okay.

524
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,450
- 一 好 - 一
- One. Okay. - One.

525
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,750
对 就说一 很好 很好
Yeah, just say "one." That's good. That's good.

526
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,890
然后我移动到我的右脚
Then I move over to my right foot.

527
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,590
你可以看到我的重心都转移到右脚
You'll see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

528
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,770
然后我用我的手背攻击
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort...

529
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,970
就像用冰锥碎冰
...of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

530
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,910
然后我转过来 转移到我的左脚
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot...

531
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,510
然后用右手攻击
...and I hit it with my right hand.

532
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,240
还是冰锥的动作
And ice pick maneuver again.

533
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,470
再转到右脚上 再攻击右侧
And I come over on my right foot and hit it right.

534
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,780
就看着我的脚步
Don't watch anything but my feet.

535
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,720
就这么做 不停练习
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

536
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,660
你示范他们怎么站立 双脚和肩膀平行
You show them how to stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.

537
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,740
训练一名拳手 你必须在精神上把他们剥光
To make a fighter, you gotta strip them down to bare wood.

538
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,400
死了再休息
Rest when you're dead.

539
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,240
过来
Come here.

540
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,420
你不能只是 叫他们忘记以前知道的事情...
You can't just tell them to forget everything you know...

541
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,650
你要叫他们从骨子里忘记
...you gotta make them forget it in their bones.

542
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,000
让他们疲惫到只听你的话
Make them so tired they only listen to you.

543
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,930
只能听见你的声音
Only hear your voice.

544
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,230
只做你叫他们做的事情 不做其他事
Only do what you say, and nothing else.

545
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,630
脚步移动
Move your feet.

546
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,800
脚步移动起来 移动起来让我看
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

547
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,050
教他们怎么保持平衡 怎么让对手失去平衡
Show them how to keep their balance and take it away from the other guy.

548
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,960
别这么低 看着我 右勾拳 然后向右
Not so low. Look at me. Right hook and just turn right.

549
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,060
如何用右脚趾产生动力
How to generate momentum off your right toe.

550
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,570
出刺拳时如何弯曲膝盖
And how to flex your knees when you fire a jab.

551
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,510
如何在后退中攻击
How to fight backing up...

552
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,110
好让对手在追击你时有所顾忌
...so that the other guy doesn't wanna come after you.

553
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,920
然后你要再全部教他们一遍
Then you gotta show them all over again.

554
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,280
一遍又一遍...
Over and over and over...

555
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,430
直到他们感觉一切与生俱来
...till they think they were born that way.

556
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,460
转移
Shift.

557
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,530
转移位置
Shift away.

558
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,730
好了 今天就到这里
Okay. That's enough for today.

559
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,340
不错 好姑娘
Good work. Good girl.

560
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,300
老板 你觉得我可以打比赛了么?
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

561
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,270
嘿 你过来
Hey. Hey, come here.

562
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,300
你都喘不过气了
You're not breathing.

563
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,670
不想和你争论
Hate to disagree with you.

564
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,110
你一有压力就喜欢屏住呼吸
Every time you get under pressure, you're holding your breath.

565
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,720
- 从现在开始别这么做 - 好的
- Now, stop doing that. - Okay.

566
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,180
除了这一点 我做得很好 是吧?
But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?

567
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,250
- 我是说 对于女孩来讲 - 我不训练女孩
- I mean, for a girl. - I don't train girls.

568
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,220
老板 你觉得我可以参加比赛了么
Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?

569
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,920
我们先找个经理人 然后我们再看看 好吗?
Well, we'll get a manager, and we'll find out, won't we?

570
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,130
我是想找一个 可是你一直让我抽不出时间来
I'd like to, but you been keeping me too busy.

571
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,770
- 有家人吗 老板? - 什么?
- Got any family, boss? - What?

572
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,810
我看你把所有的时间都花在我的身上了
You been spending all this time with me.

573
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,710
我不知道你有没有家人
I didn't know if you had any.

574
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,950
没有
No.

575
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,990
我是有个女儿 叫凯蒂
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

576
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,020
她就是家人啊
That's family.

577
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,890
但是我们并不那么亲近
We're not exactly close.

578
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,800
她多重?
How much she weigh?

579
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,360
什么?
What?

580
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,730
我的家庭问题和体重成正比
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

581
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,700
是吗
Yeah.

582
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,070
不是很重
Not very big.

583
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,340
曾经很爱运动 不知道现在还有没有坚持
Used to be real athletic. Don't know if she kept it up.

584
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,910
那么 你怎么想?
So, what do you think?

585
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,990
我可以参加比赛了么?
I ready for a fight?

586
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,560
嘿 赛利
Hey, Sally.

587
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,690
过来一下 好吗?
Come here for a minute, will you?

588
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,400
弗兰基 能不能到后面来跟我谈谈?
Frankie, I need to see you in the back for a minute, okay?

589
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,060
- 我能和你说句话么? - 赛利是个很优秀的经理人
- Can I see you a minute? - Sally here's a real good manager.

590
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,200
他手下还有几个拿过金手套的选手 想要女孩吗 赛利?
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys. Looking for a girl, Sally?

591
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,600
如果有优秀人选的话
I'm looking for a good one.

592
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,020
看 这不就有了
Well, see, there you go.

593
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,550
很高兴和你合作 小姐
Nice working with you, girlie.

594
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,430
- 你有什么事? - 没什么 没什么
- What'd you want? - Nothing. It's nothing.

595
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,970
我没撒谎 我已经看过你训练了 你的左拳很厉害
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work. You got a hell of a left.

596
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,870
谢谢你
Thank you.

597
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,470
那你要不要试试? 看看是不是合适?
So you wanna give this a try? See if it's a fit?

598
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,460
- 噢 当然 - 好
- Yeah, sure. - Good.

599
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,470
好 因为我觉得你已经够资格比赛了
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

600
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,190
分开
Break.

601
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,230
我到底做错了什么 赛利? 每次我逼近都被她痛击
What am I doing wrong, Sally? Every time I get inside, she's on me.

602
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,100
你做得很好 你就快把她拖垮了 继续出拳
You're doing great. You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

603
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,910
- 我不好 我要输了 - 你就快把她拖垮了
- I ain't doing great, I'm losing. - You're wearing her down.

604
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,410
没事吧 亲爱的?看得清吗?
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

605
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,010
- 加油 - 加油
- Come on. - Do it.

606
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,710
加油 加油!
Come on, let's do this!

607
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,150
没错!
That's it!

608
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,200
今晚真不错 不是吗?
Nice night, eh?

609
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,300
老天
Jesus Christ.

610
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,340
那姑娘是罗尼·华盛顿的拳手
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

611
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,300
非常优秀的拳手
Hell of a fighter.

612
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,530
11场全胜
11- 0.

613
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,680
左拳 左拳举起来
Your left. Keep your left up.

614
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,540
罗尼旗下有很多优秀拳手
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

615
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,850
轻量级冠军乔伊 阿达乔也在他旗下
He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ?

616
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,510
对
Yeah.

617
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,720
你的左拳 该死
Your left, damn it.

618
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,890
要是我肯定不会选她做第一个对手
Wouldn't have been my choice for her first fight...

619
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,290
不过赛利是个好经理人
...but Sally's a good manager.

620
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,200
- 他一定认为她能打败她 - 天哪
- He must think she can take her. - Jesus H.

621
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,000
左拳 左拳举起来
Your left. Keep your left up.

622
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,430
你认为这么远的地方她能听见?
You think she can hear you from back here?

623
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,250
当然 就算麦琪输了 对赛利也算不了什么
Of course, if Maggie loses, it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

624
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,410
也许还对他有帮助
Might even help him.

625
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,490
让罗尼的女选手再胜一场...
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

626
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,620
罗尼也许会让赛利的轻量级拳手
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight...

627
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,220
去挑战乔伊·阿达乔的冠军
...fight Joey Adagio for the title.

628
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,830
赛利想要安排一场和阿达乔的比赛?
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

629
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,430
嘿 我知道什么?
Hey, what do I know?

630
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,330
我只是来欣赏比赛
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

631
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,060
上帝
Mother of God.

632
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,430
好了 分开
Okay, break.

633
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,970
嘿 过来 过来
Hey. Come here, come here.

634
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,540
嘿 过来
Hey. Get over here.

635
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,540
你老是放低左拳 别再放低左拳了
You're dropping your left hand. Quit dropping your left hand.

636
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,440
嘿 弗兰基 你能不能让我跟我的拳手谈谈?
Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?

637
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,820
你干得还真不赖啊
You're doing a hell of a job.

638
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,020
你也是这样指导你的轻量级选手的?
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

639
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,110
我是邓
Dunn.

640
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,780
- 你在干什么? - 我在说话 你在干什么?
- What are you doing? - I'm talking. What are you doing?

641
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,860
- 这是你的拳手么? - 是我的拳手
- Is this your fighter? - It's my fighter.

642
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,420
真的不是那么合适 赛利
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

643
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,730
好吧 你来带她 反正她也屁都不会打
Fine, you take her. She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

644
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,300
谁告诉我到底怎么回事
Somebody tell me what's going on.

645
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,300
我迟到了 赛利刚才只是替我
I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

646
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,910
你说她是你的拳手?
You telling me this is your fighter?

647
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,480
对 是我的拳手
Yeah, this is my fighter.

648
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,340
那么你有10秒的时间
Then you got 10 seconds.

649
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,410
我把左手举起来了
I keep holding my left up.

650
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,810
可当我出拳的时候 就总是会放下去
Then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

651
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,040
- 那就放下去好了 - 那就简单多了
- Well, let it drop. - That'd be a lot easier.

652
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,380
她认为她摸透你了
She thinks she knows you.

653
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,580
你左手每次放下 她就从上面打过来
Every time you drop it, she comes right over the top.

654
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,990
那你就等着她 明白吗? 她脑子里就这么多东西
So you just wait for her, see? That's all she's thinking about.

655
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,130
她收回右拳准备出击的时...你听见了吗?
When she cocks that right hand... You hear?

656
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,150
我听着呢 老板
I hear you, boss.

657
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,920
如果她那么做 你就向旁边躲一步
When she does, step to the side...

658
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,320
然后给她一记再见勾拳
...and come with a good- night hook.

659
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,830
- 能行吗? - 看我的吧
- Got one? - Got it right here.

660
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,760
- 好 - 开始吧 我等着呢
- Okay. - Fight, or I'm calling it.

661
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,730
去教训她吧
Go give it to her.

662
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,930
拳手的身体了解拳手自己所不了解的东西
The body knows what fighters don 't.

663
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,340
如何保护自己
How to protect itself.

664
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,310
脖子只能转动那么多
A neck can only twist so far.

665
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,680
哪怕再多转一毫米 身体就会说
Twist it just a hair more, and the body says:

666
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,310
嘿 还是让我来吧
"Hey, I'll take it from here...

667
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,010
因为很明显你不知道你自己在做什么
...because you obviously don't know what you're doing."

668
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,020
到中立区去
Neutral corner.

669
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,360
- 看见她怎么出拳了么? - 是的
- See the way she did that? - Yeah.

670
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,490
舒格 雷就会这么做 这女人好像他一样
Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.

671
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,890
躺下 休息
"Lie down, now, rest...

672
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,290
等你恢复知觉我们再谈
...and we'll talk about this when you regain your senses."

673
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,700
这个叫做击倒心理
It's called the knockout mechanism.

674
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,570
现在放松一点 你干得不错
Don't get all carried away, now. You did good.

675
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,680
谢了 老板
Thanks, boss.

676
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,410
你...你忘了规矩
You... You forgot the rule.

677
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,010
- 告诉我规矩是什么? - 左手要抬起?
- Now, what is the rule? - Keep my left up?

678
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,150
规矩是要随时保护自己
It's to protect yourself at all times.

679
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,280
好 规矩是什么?
Now, what is the rule?

680
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,790
- 随时保护我自己 - 很好 很好
- Protect myself at all times. - Good, good.

681
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,190
你放弃了我 那对我是什么样的保护?
You gave me away. How was that protecting me?

682
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,020
那不是保护
It wasn't.

683
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,650
没关系了
It's okay.

684
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,200
- 我会练习我的左手的 老板 - 把水喝了
- I'll work on my left, boss. - Drink your water.

685
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,000
除了这一点 我怎么样?
Other than that, how'd I do?

686
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,310
很好 你做得很好
Fine. You did fine.

687
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,800
你还会再放弃我么?
You gonna leave me again?

688
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,640
永远不会
Never.

689
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,180
你工作的那个地方 有没有手工制柠檬酥皮派?
That place you work, do they have homemade lemon meringue pie there?

690
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,350
- 当然有 - 不是罐装馅料的那种垃圾
- Sure. - Not the kind with the canned- filling crap?

691
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,220
噢 是很大罐的那种 标签上写着"手工制作"
Oh, big can, yay size. Says "homemade" on the label.

692
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,720
- 我想你这个周末休息一下 - 这才星期四
- I want you to take the weekend off. - It's only Thursday.

693
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,600
- 你打算要和我争? - 我知道最好不要有这个想法 老板
- You gonna argue with me? - Know better than to do that, boss.

694
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
很好
Well, good.

695
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,840
某种角度来看 拳手大都很顽固
All fighters are pigheaded some way or other.

696
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,010
他们的某个部分总觉得
Some part of them always thinks...

697
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,710
在某件事情上自己比别人知道的更多
...they know better than you about something.

698
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,150
你能不能花几分钟讲讲圣母怀胎?
Can you spare a few minutes for the Immaculate Conception?

699
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,620
实际上 就算他们错了...
Truth is, even if they're wrong...

700
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,780
就算有那么件事情 可以把他们都毁了...
...even if that one thing is gonna be the ruin of them...

701
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,790
如果你能把他们彻底打败 那他们就不算是拳手了
...if you can beat that last bit out of them, then they ain 't fighters at all.

702
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,230
- 我记得我说过让你周一再来 - 没错 老板
- Thought I said I'd see you Monday. - You sure did, boss.

703
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,130
就是昨晚说的
That was last night.

704
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,100
你说不要和你争论
You said not to argue with you.

705
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,210
该死的女人总是不按我的指挥做事
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

706
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,350
想听我的建议么?
You want my advice?

707
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,990
什么?
What?

708
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,410
你的鞋子哪去了?
Where are your shoes?

709
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,790
我给我的脚透透风
I'm airing out my feet.

710
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,400
你的袜子上净是大洞
You got big holes in your socks.

711
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,430
噢 没有那么大啦
Oh, they're not that big.

712
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,470
我不是给你钱去买新的了吗?
Didn't I give you money for some new ones?

713
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,800
这是我的睡袜
These are my sleeping socks.

714
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,840
我的脚晚上需要一些新鲜空气
My feet like a little air at night.

715
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,680
那你为什么要在白天穿它们?
How come you're wearing them in the daytime, then?

716
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,840
因为我白天穿的袜子上洞太多了
Because my daytime socks got too many holes in them.

717
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,690
那好 如果我多给你些钱 你能去买几双新的么?
Well, if I give you some more money, you buy some new socks.

718
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,660
拜托?
Please?

719
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,870
很有吸引力 不过我不能保证
Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.

720
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,970
也许会跑到跑道上去
Might find its way to the track.

721
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,720
比赛结束 比赛结束
It's over. It's over.

722
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,240
麦琪没花多少时间就取得连胜
Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.

723
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,120
我解决了呼吸的问题
I got the breathing thing down.

724
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,650
不 你还是呼吸不正确
No, you ain't breathing...

725
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,850
因为你第一回合就把对方打倒了
...because you're knocking them out in the first round.

726
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,550
- 我还以为那就是重点 - 重点是让自己变强
- Thought that was the point. - The point is to get good.

727
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,790
把对方第一回合就击倒 自己怎么可能进步
Can't get good if you keep knocking them out first round.

728
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,160
我怎么给你再找到对手?
How am I gonna get you fights?

729
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,270
没人愿意自己的拳手被羞辱
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed, now.

730
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,070
为什么我还要 打这种四回合比赛 老板?
Why am I still doing four- rounders, boss?

731
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,840
因为你的肺还打不了六回合
Because you haven't got the lungs for six rounds.

732
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,210
我一直这么在第一回合 就把她们击倒就行了
I do if I keep knocking them out in the first round.

733
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,380
弗兰基让她又打了场四回合比赛...
Frankie made her fight one more four- rounder...

734
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,750
只是让她明白谁说了算数
...just to let her know who was boss.

735
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,790
三 四 五...
Three, four, five...

736
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
六 七...
...six, seven...

737
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,860
抱歉 老板
Sorry, boss.

738
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,090
麦琪对此毫不怀疑
Maggie left no doubt about it.

739
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,240
好了 加油
All right, let's do it.

740
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,380
但是第一场六回合赛并没那么轻松
Her first six- rounder didn't go quite as smooth.

741
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,960
起来!
Get up!

742
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,430
到你的角落去
To your corner.

743
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,760
- 三 四 五... - 起来
- Three, four, five... - Get up.

744
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,160
- ...六 七... - 起来
...six, seven... - Get up.

745
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,770
- ...八 九 十 比赛结束 - 你能做到
...eight, nine, ten. It's over. - You can do this.

746
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,090
麦琪到了第一回合结尾才将对方击倒
Maggie didn't knock her out till the end of the first round.

747
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:05,820
在那以后 没有经理愿意 让自己的拳手和麦琪交手
After that, no manager wanted to put his fighter in with Maggie.

748
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,520
弗兰基不得不自己讨腰包 来给她安排比赛...
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights...

749
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,130
靠给对方经理人贿赂 来增加对方参赛的兴趣
...sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side.

750
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,180
这并没能持续太久
That only worked for so long.

751
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,490
然后弗兰基做了他不愿意做的事
Then Frankie did something he hated doing.

752
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,150
他冒了次险
He took a chance.

753
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,650
开始
Box.

754
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,050
他把她晋升了一个级别
He moved her up in class.

755
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,530
这差点成为一个错误
That could've been a mistake.

756
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,820
注意右边!
Watch the right!

757
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,380
注意 注意
Watch it. Watch it.

758
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,160
分开 分开 后退 时间到
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

759
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,210
该死 该死 该死
Damn, damn, damn.

760
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,660
给我们两秒钟 好吗?
Give us two seconds, will you?

761
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,040
- 好 - 两秒钟就好
- Okay. - Just two seconds.

762
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,600
- 你的鼻梁骨断了 - 噢 该死
- Your nose is broke. - Oh, damn.

763
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,540
- 弄好它 - 我没办法 我没办法
- Fix it. - I can't, I can't.

764
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,240
- 你可以的 - 我不行 我准备弃权了
- You can fix it. - I can't. I've gotta call it.

765
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,510
我见你做过 弄好它
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

766
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,510
我能把它按回去 但是我不能给你止血
I can snap it back into place, but I can't stop the bleeding.

767
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,210
医务裁判会中止比赛的
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

768
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:55,130
求你 弗兰基 你要是能帮我止血 我就能打倒她
Please, Frankie, if you can stop the blood, I can beat her.

769
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,470
咬住这个
Bite down on this.

770
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,640
- 吸气 - 什么?
- Inhale. - What?

771
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,510
- 吸气 - 什么
- Inhale. - What?

772
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,850
吸气
Breathe in.

773
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,430
- 可以? - 没问题
- Okay, huh? - Yeah, it's okay.

774
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,700
好 这个变成喷泉之前你有20秒钟...
All right, you got 20 seconds before this turns into a geyser...

775
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,010
血会喷到整个前排座位上的
...and it's gonna spray all over the front row.

776
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,370
你只有20秒
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

777
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,750
去吧
Now get going.

778
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,330
回到你的角落去
Go to your corner.

779
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,800
三 四 五...
Three, four, five...

780
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,670
- 加油 呼吸 呼吸 - ...六 七 八...
- Come on, breathe. Breathe. ...six, seven, eight...

781
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:10,400
九 十
...nine, ten.

782
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,300
"莫库什勒"
Mo cuishle.

783
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,580
- 好! - 太棒了!
- All right! - Yeah!

784
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,860
对
Right.

785
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,830
你在读什么
What you reading?

786
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,960
她说什么?
What's she saying?

787
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,500
想知道你在读什么
Wants to know what you're reading.

788
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,970
是叶芝的作品(爱尔兰著名诗人) 仰着点头
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

789
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,370
你为什么不跟她说说叶芝呢?
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her.

790
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,580
告诉她那是怎样一件乐事
Show her what a treat that is.

791
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,710
他妈的什么时候才能轮到她?
When the hell they gonna get to her?

792
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,610
我很好 弗兰基
I'm okay, Frankie.

793
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,850
- 你今天学到了什么? - 随时保护自己
- What'd you learn tonight? - Always protect myself.

794
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,130
- 规矩是什么? - 随时保护自己
- What's the rule? - Always protect myself.

795
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,620
- 麦琪·菲斯杰拉德? - 在这里
- Margaret Fitzgerald? - Here.

796
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,130
我就在这儿等你
I'll be right here.

797
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,090
- 你怎么样? - 我?
- How you doing? - Me?

798
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,680
- 对 你 - 我又没有受伤
- Yeah, you. - I'm not the one who's hurt.

799
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,350
鼻子断了并不是那么受伤
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

800
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,390
为什么你要告诉我这个?
Why are you telling me that?

801
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,460
没有原因
No reason.

802
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,010
可有些伤太深了 或是离骨头太近
But some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone.

803
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:44,680
不管你如何努力 都不能止血
And no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.

804
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,670
- 你给你女儿写信了么? - 每周都写
- Did you write your daughter? - Every week.

805
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,200
我真不明白你为什么要来教堂
I've no idea why you come to church.

806
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,410
在连续十二场比赛击倒对手胜出后
After her 12th straight knockout.

807
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,110
弗兰基得到几个非常不错的邀请
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.

808
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:33,840
第一个邀请是和 "兰熊"比丽·奥斯特曼...
The first was to fight Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...

809
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,820
争夺WBA次中量级头衔
...for the WBA welterweight title.

810
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,110
"兰熊"比丽
Billie "The Blue Bear."

811
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,410
比丽原来是东柏林的妓女
Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin.

812
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,230
她是这个级别里 手法最肮脏的拳手 臭名远扬
Had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

813
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,640
她看起来一点也不在乎...
Didn't seem to matter to her...

814
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,880
这样的动作可能会致人于死地
...that something like that could kill a person.

815
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,990
观众喜欢她
And the crowds loved her.

816
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,450
他没告诉她就把这场比赛拒绝了
He turned it down without even telling her.

817
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,880
下一个邀请是去挑战英国冠军
The next was to fight the British champ...

818
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,800
- 一个刚被比丽击败的牙买加女孩 - 喂?
- ...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat. - Hello?

819
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,600
不感兴趣
Not interested.

820
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:34,000
他也没接受那个邀请
He turned that down too.

821
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,990
可是很大一笔钱哪 老板
That's a lot of money, boss.

822
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,620
是啊 你挣钱了 为什么还在这里工作?
Yeah, you're making money. What are you still working here for?

823
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,490
那是冠军赛 对吧?
It's a title match, right?

824
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,640
你是英国人么? 那个冠军你拿不走的
Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.

825
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,660
她没什么好输的 你也没什么好赢的
She's got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win.

826
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,500
很可能仍然是一场不错的比赛呢
Might still be a good fight.

827
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,200
是啊 我刚把你升上次中量级
Yeah, I just... I just brought you up to welterweight.

828
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,220
能和跟你水平相当的选手打就不错了
Too good to fight these contenders.

829
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,820
还想他妈去挑战那些冠军?
You'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

830
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,510
我没发现有和我水平相当的选手啊
Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.

831
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,510
如果你想的话 随时可以换经理
Well, you can get yourself another manager any time you want.

832
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,940
实际上 如果你有能力 把自己的脸保护得好一点的话...
In fact, if you'd learn to protect your face a little better...

833
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,210
我才不会拒绝这笔钱呢
...I wouldn't have to turn down this money.

834
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,120
我的脸暴露出那么多 可还没被击倒过 真是个奇迹
My face is out there so much it's a miracle I haven't been knocked out yet.

835
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,960
你今晚不要继续训练了
No, you can't work here anymore tonight.

836
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,790
我定了位子
I made us a reservation.

837
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:02,790
你去洗个澡吧
You might wanna shower.

838
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,110
你的
Here you go.

839
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,150
你的
Here you go.

840
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,350
这是什么?
What's this?

841
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,820
你想要的东西 这不是什么秘密
Well, it ain't no big secret what you're wishing for.

842
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,830
把蜡烛吹了
Go on and blow.

843
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,460
谢谢你
Thank you.

844
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:47,070
33岁不算大的
Thirty- three ain't so old.

845
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,640
我39岁的时候还在参赛
I was still fighting at 39.

846
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:54,470
我打了23年
Fought for 23 years.

847
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,880
最近怎么样 斯科雷普
How's it going, Scrap?

848
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,720
不错 米奇
Doing good, Mickey.

849
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:04,590
不错
Doing good.

850
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,520
- 你要什么? - 咖啡
- What'll you have? - Coffee.

851
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,300
你们两个不讲话?
You two not speaking?

852
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,970
不太认识他
Don't hardly know him.

853
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:28,110
我在37岁生日之后遇到了弗兰基
I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday.

854
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,710
那时他干的工作是给拳手包扎伤口
He was picking up cut work.

855
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:36,390
我认为不可能的时候 他总能给我包扎好
He used to patch me up when I thought it was impossible.

856
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,720
有他在赛场边真不错
Good man to have in your corner.

857
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,600
是啊
Yes, he is.

858
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,360
我最后一次比赛 在圣伯蒂诺 他也陪了我全场
He stayed with me through my last fight in San Berdu.

859
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,610
我的经理喝醉了 不知所踪
My manager was off getting drunk somewhere...

860
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,630
只有我和弗兰基
...and it was just Frankie and me.

861
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,350
我被打得晕头转向
I was taking a hellacious beating.

862
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:05,120
每个人最多能参加多少比赛 都有个数字
Everybody's got a particular number of fights in him.

863
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,760
没人告诉你那个数字是多少
Nobody tells you what that number is.

864
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,360
我的是109场
Mine was 109.

865
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,230
我只是不愿承认
I just didn't want to admit it.

866
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,330
第四回合
Fourth round, this...

867
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,470
这里被打开了口子
...cut opens up.

868
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,740
鲜血涌进我的眼睛
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

869
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,300
他们本应该终止那场比赛的
They should've stopped the fight...

870
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,600
但是 妈的 我是个在圣伯蒂诺的黑人
...but, hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

871
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,980
我到那里就是去流血的
Blood was what I was there for.

872
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:37,410
一回合接着一回合 我不断地让弗兰基给我包扎
Round after round, I kept getting Frankie to patch me up.

873
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,980
他想扔毛巾认输...
He's talking about throwing in the towel...

874
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,490
但他不是我的经理人 什么也不能扔
...but he ain't my manager, he can't throw in nothing.

875
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,790
一回合接着一回合...
Round after round...

876
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,300
他一直跟我争吵
...he's arguing with me.

877
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:54,760
我几乎是在笑他 因为 妈的 好像是打在他身上似的
And I'm almost laughing because, hell, it's getting more to him than to me.

878
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,160
我打了15回合
I go 15 rounds...

879
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,570
裁判判我输了
...Iose by decision.

880
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,610
第二天早上 我的眼睛没了
Next morning, I lose the eye.

881
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,640
23年来 他从来没说起过这件事
In 23 years, he's never said a thing about it.

882
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,650
没这个必要 每次他看我 我都能从他的脸上读出来
Doesn't have to. I can see it in his face every time he looks at me.

883
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,290
某种程度上
Somehow...

884
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,960
弗兰基认为自己应该终止那场比赛
...Frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight...

885
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,130
可以挽救我的眼睛
...should've saved my eye.

886
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:30,470
他一生都希望能收回那第109场比赛
Spends his life wishing he could take back that 109th fight.

887
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,240
但我却想参加第110场
I wanted to go to 110.

888
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,840
重点是
Thing is...

889
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,310
如果你想取得冠军
...if you wanna get to the title...

890
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,310
也许他并不是最好人选
...maybe he's not the one to take you there.

891
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,650
你告诉了麦克先生我们今晚会来这里?
You tell Mr.Mack we'd be here tonight?

892
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,060
继续吃你的蛋糕吧
You go on, eat your cupcake.

893
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,960
不用了 我来吧
No, I got it.

894
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,910
这就是规矩
It's the rule.

895
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,480
随时保护自己
Always protect yourself.

896
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,880
人们从不采纳自己的意见
People never take their own advice.

897
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:17,080
如果她要离开弗兰基 最好当时就做
If she was gonna leave Frankie, better she did it to him then.

898
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,390
米奇·麦克先生?
Mr.Mickey Mack?

899
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,890
麦琪·菲斯杰拉德
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

900
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,930
我听说你是非常好的经理人 给大个子威利做的很不错
I hear you're a real good manager, doing good things for Big Willie.

901
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:35,430
但我想你该知道 我是不会离开邓先生的
But I thought you should know I ain't never leaving Mr.Dunn...

902
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,360
所以你不需要再找借口好遇见我了
...so you don't need to make any more excuses to bump into me.

903
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,810
不好意思打搅你吃饭了
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

904
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:51,710
麦琪总是喜欢刚一交手 就把对手击倒
Maggie always did like taking them out in the first round.

905
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:28,760
寄出的信总是原样退回
The letters always came back marked the same way:

906
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,120
上面写着"退还发件人"
"Return to sender."

907
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,180
我给你准备点咖啡
I'll make you some coffee.

908
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,820
你打算拿你的钱干些什么?
What are you doing with your money?

909
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,520
- 存起来 - 好孩子
- Saving it. - Good girl.

910
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,770
你知道 如果存够了就可以买座小房
You know, you save enough of it, you ought to get yourself a little house.

911
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,270
现金 不用贷款
Cash, no mortgage.

912
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,000
那还要存一段时间
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

913
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:25,340
是啊 可能还有一段时间...
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

914
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,140
但你得给自己弄个窝
...but you gotta get yourself a place of your own.

915
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,550
把钱浪费在无关紧要的东西上 你能得到什么?
Go around wasting it on things that don't matter and what do you got?

916
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,420
明白么?
You understand?

917
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:37,490
很快 如果你等得太久 你什么也得不到
Pretty soon, you wait long enough, you got nothing.

918
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,650
好吧 只要我存够钱
Okay, soon as I get the money.

919
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,190
我这一生中犯了很多错误
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

920
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:43,890
我只是不想你走一样的路
I'm just trying to keep you from doing the same.

921
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,990
知道了 老板
I know, boss.

922
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,770
- 我不会长命百岁的 - 这是什么?
- I'm not gonna live forever. - What is it?

923
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,600
一盒关于你那个英国对手的录像带
It's a tape on that girl in England you're gonna fight.

924
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,110
如果你想去争夺冠军 我们得做...嘿!
If you're gonna go for the title, we got some moves to... Hey.

925
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,940
嘿 快他妈下来 知道我有多大岁数么?
Hey, get the hell down. You know how old I am?

926
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,740
- 谢谢老板 非常感谢
- Thank you, boss. Thank you so much. - Yeah.

927
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,360
不用谢 亲爱的 给 把...我把这个放到机器里去
You're welcome, darling. Here, just... Here, let me put this in the machine.

928
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,550
什么机器?
What machine?

929
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,720
你没有电视 是么?
Don't have a TV, huh?

930
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,660
没有
No.

931
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,090
耶!
Yeah!

932
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,290
好了 好的
All right. Okay.

933
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,870
- 还有十分钟 亲爱的 - 谢谢
- Ten minutes, love. - Thank you.

934
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,610
那家伙说他爱我
Man says he loves me.

935
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,870
他不可能是第一个这么说的男人
He's probably not the first one to say that.

936
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,280
除了我爸以外的第一个
First since my daddy.

937
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,580
我要是赢了 你说他会向我求婚么?
I win, you think he'll propose?

938
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,080
你赢了 我就向你求婚
You win, I'll propose.

939
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,830
看 我给你带了件礼物
Look, I got you a gift here.

940
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:50,860
我想这是其他人的吧
I think they gave you somebody else's.

941
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,000
不 不 就是这个
No, no, this is it.

942
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,500
"莫库什勒"是什么意思?
What's it mean?

943
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:59,510
不知道 是高卢语
I don't know. Just something in Gaelic.

944
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,140
- 真漂亮 - 我也这么认为
- It's beautiful. - Yeah, I thought so.

945
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:06,140
- 是啊 - 真丝的
- Yeah. - Real silk thread.

946
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,090
来自美国的挑战者...
From the United States of America, the challenger...

947
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,590
麦琪·菲斯杰拉德
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

948
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,460
"莫库什勒" 你看到她袍子上的字了吗?
Mo cuishle. Did you see what was on her robe?

949
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,900
- "莫库什勒" "莫库什勒" - "莫库什勒"
- Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle. - Mo cuishle.

950
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,970
她本不是本晚的卖点
She wasn 't the main attraction.

951
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,800
她的比赛是一场中量级拳王赛的垫场赛
She was on the undercard of a middleweight title fight.

952
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,170
但如果你问问在场的人...
But ask someone who was there...

953
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:39,340
他们都不记得 当晚参加比赛的其他选手了
...they couldn 't tell you who else fought that night.

954
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,150
开始
Box.

955
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,200
- 加油! - "莫库什勒"!
- Come on! - Mo cuishle!

956
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:14,080
"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

957
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,910
"莫库什勒"!
Mo cuishle!

958
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,310
"莫库什勒"!
Mo cuishle!

959
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:24,180
"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

960
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,700
她很强
She's tough.

961
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,840
我无法靠近 我无法靠近打到她
I can't get inside. I can't get close enough to hit her.

962
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:41,480
- 你知道为什么吗? - 为什么?
- You know why that is? - Why?

963
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,850
因为她是个比你更好的拳手
She's a better fighter than you are.

964
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:48,110
她更年轻 更强壮 更有经验
She's younger, she's stronger, and she's more experienced. Now...

965
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,480
现在你打算怎么办?
...what are you gonna do about it?

966
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:00,290
去吧
Get in there.

967
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,590
开始
Box.

968
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:21,010
三 四 五 六..
Three, four, five, six...

969
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:26,350
七 八 九 十
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

970
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:30,620
"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

971
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,100
- "莫库什勒"! - "莫库什勒"!
- Mo cuishle! - Mo cuishle!

972
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,440
你知道我可以问其他人 对吗?
I could ask someone, you know?

973
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,340
好啊
Good.

974
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,540
你知道以后告诉我
You find out, you let me know.

975
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,560
不管那个名字是什么意思 人们记住了
Whatever it meant, the name stuck.

976
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:09,290
麦琪打遍爱丁堡 巴黎 布鲁塞尔和阿姆斯特丹
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

977
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,300
观众总是高呼"莫库什勒"
It was always mo cuishle.

978
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,870
看起来到处是爱尔兰人...
Seems there are Irish people everywhere...

979
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,370
或者是想成为爱尔兰人的人
...or people who wanna be.

980
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:20,260
当他们回到美国的时候...
By the time they came back to the States...

981
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:24,200
麦琪已经达到了一个新的水平
...Maggie was in a whole new league.

982
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:45,790
"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!"莫库什勒"!
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

983
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,810
后来他们受到另一场冠军赛的邀请
After that they got another offer to fight for the title.

984
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,050
怎么分成?
What's the split?

985
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,050
- 六四开 - 好
- Sixty- forty. - Good.

986
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,180
好 我们六 你们四 因为麦琪是吸引观众的筹码
We'll take 60 and you take 40, being as that Maggie's the draw.

987
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,090
那个小女孩
That little girl?

988
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,830
你真的认为我说的不对? 你认为观众会说...
You think I'm wrong, really? You think people are saying...

989
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,800
他们想看一个破烂德国人
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut...

990
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,800
痛揍无名氏小姐?
...beat up on little Miss What's- Her- Name?

991
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:23,030
你要能找到那样的人 我们就拿四
You find someone who says that, and we'll take the 40.

992
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,270
给你
There you go.

993
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:38,980
他们现在是六四开 不过最后会是五五开
They're at 60- 40, but they'll come up to 50- 50.

994
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,480
那女孩现在怎么样了?
How's that girl doing?

995
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:44,790
她脑震荡了 耳鼓膜破裂
Well, she's got a concussion and a broken eardrum.

996
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,900
她没事吧
She be all right?

997
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,960
- 她要是有事呢? - 也许我应该给她送点什么
- And if she isn't? - Maybe I should send her something.

998
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:55,300
你愿意的话 把你的奖金寄给她好了 我想她会接受
Well, you could send her your check if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

999
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,070
老板?
Boss?

1000
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,110
我们说起过的那座房子?
That little house we talked about?

1001
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:05,940
我买下了
I bought it.

1002
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:08,980
聪明的姑娘
Well, smart girl.

1003
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,450
给我妈买的 离她现在住的地方不到一英里
For my mama. It's only about a mile from where she lives now.

1004
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,750
如你所言 没有贷款
No mortgage, just like you said.

1005
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:20,090
你是个好女儿
You're a good daughter.

1006
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,820
她还不知道
She don't know about it yet.

1007
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,530
我希望我们可以多待一天 开车到那里去
I was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day, drive over there?

1008
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,640
我知道她想见你
I know she wants to meet you.

1009
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,830
好吧 可以
Yeah, we could do that.

1010
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:54,060
天哪 妈妈快出来
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

1011
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:56,430
麦琪回来了
Mary M's here.

1012
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,540
- 这是约翰逊家的旧屋 - 不再是了
- This is the Johnsons' old house. - Not anymore.

1013
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,090
它是你的了 妈妈 还有玛代尔和孩子们
It's all yours, Mama. For you and Mardell and the kids.

1014
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,960
麦琪 这房子是你给我买的?
Mary M, you bought this for me?

1015
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,060
对 是你的了 全部付清了
Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

1016
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,930
亲爱的
Darling...

1017
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,430
没冰箱 也没炉灶
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

1018
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,900
在你们搬进来前 会准备好的
They'll be here before you move in.

1019
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,540
- 你花了多少钱? - 你不用管
- How much money did this cost you? - Never mind that.

1020
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:42,400
- 你不该这么做 - 您需要一个体面的住处
- You shouldn't have done this. - You need a decent place.

1021
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:45,880
你不该这么做 你该先问问我的
You shouldn't have done it. You should've asked me first.

1022
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,480
如果政府发现了 他们会停掉我的社会福利的
Government's gonna find out about this, they're gonna stop my welfare.

1023
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:54,490
- 妈妈 他们不会的 - 他们会的 你很好 有自己的工作
- Mama, no, they ain't. - They are. You're fine, you're working...

1024
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,520
但没有福利我活不下去
...but I can't live without my welfare.

1025
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,350
妈妈我会给你寄钱的
Mama, I'll send you money.

1026
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,930
医疗怎么办? 公费医疗会把我从名单上划掉
What about my medicine? Medicaid gonna cut me off.

1027
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,730
- 我拿什么钱买药啊? - 我会给你寄更多的钱
- How am I supposed to get my medicine? - I'll send you more money.

1028
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:08,330
我希望你没有预期JD要住进来
I hope you don't expect J.D. To move in with us.

1029
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,770
你知道他快出狱了
He's getting out, you know.

1030
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,970
为什么不把钱直接给我?
Why didn't you just give me the money?

1031
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,600
为什么必须给我买房子?
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

1032
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:22,340
不是必须 妈妈 但房子是你的了
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

1033
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,680
如果想要钱 把它卖掉好了
You want the money, sell it.

1034
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,850
我不...
I don't...

1035
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,300
我知道你不想伤害我们...
I know you didn't mean nothing hurtful...

1036
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:43,870
只是有时候你没把事情想清楚
...but sometimes you just don't think things through.

1037
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,570
- 这倒是真的 妈妈 - 我会试着不把房子卖掉
- That's true, Mama. - I'll try and keep the house.

1038
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,410
我只是担心养房子的那些费用
I'm just worried about all those expenses.

1039
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,480
我会给你寄更多钱的
I'll send you some more money.

1040
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,890
那个人把你打成这样的?
That man hitting you?

1041
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,590
这是比赛留下的
It's from the fight.

1042
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,520
我是一名拳击手 妈妈
I'm a fighter, Mama.

1043
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,370
找个老公吧 麦琪
Find a man, Mary M.

1044
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,200
过正常的生活
Live proper.

1045
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:17,360
人们知道你的职业后就会嘲笑你
People hear about what you're doing and they laugh.

1046
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,600
告诉你我很难过 但是他们嘲笑你
Hurts me to tell you, but they laugh at you.

1047
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:14,090
嗨
Hi.

1048
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:46,520
你养过狗么?
You ever own a dog?

1049
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,220
没有
Nope.

1050
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:52,990
我差点养了一只巴斯顿的中型狗
Closest I ever came was a middleweight from Barstow.

1051
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:59,400
我爸养过一只德国牧羊犬 埃克斯
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1052
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,270
埃克斯的后腿不太好
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1053
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,140
它得用自己的前腿拖着自己
...he had to drag himself...

1054
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,040
从一个房间走到另一个房间
...room to room by his front legs.

1055
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,180
看他跑过厨房的地板
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1056
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:12,180
我和玛代尔都会忍不住大笑
...watching him scoot across the kitchen floor.

1057
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,450
爸爸 他当时病的很重 自己都站不起来
Daddy, he was so sick by then, he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1058
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:21,380
但一天早上他起床以后 把埃克斯抱到他的拖车上
But one morning he got up, carried Axel to his rig...

1059
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,960
他们俩跑进树林里 又唱又叫
...and the two of them went off into the woods, singing and howling.

1060
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:30,190
直到那天晚上他独自回来时
But it wasn't till he got home that night alone that I saw...

1061
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:33,000
我才发现卡车里的铲子
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1062
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,740
好想再看看他们俩在一起的样子
Sure miss watching the two of them together.

1063
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,210
我现在除了你谁都没有了 弗兰基
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1064
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:57,360
对 你还有我
Well, you've got me.

1065
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:04,000
至少在你找到一个好经理人以前是这样
At least, that is, until we find you a good manager.

1066
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:15,910
嘿 我们能在这停一下么?
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1067
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,980
好
Yeah.

1068
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,450
这里有附近最好的柠檬派
This place has the best lemon pie around.

1069
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,560
没有那种恶心的罐装馅
None of that canned- filling crap.

1070
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,800
现在我可以上天堂了
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1071
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,650
我以前和爸爸常来这
I used to come here with Daddy.

1072
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,340
我不知道像这样的地方会不会出售
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1073
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,040
我还有点积蓄
I got a little bit of savings.

1074
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,630
（艾记小吃店）

1075
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:04,620
好 好 谢谢
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1076
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:11,430
嘿 丹吉尔到底在看什么?
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1077
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,500
好像是另外一瓶水
Looks like another bottle of water.

1078
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:17,010
想和我们一起到拉斯维加斯去么?
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1079
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,040
看你们在老虎机那儿受罪?
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?

1080
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,140
我的心脏受不了那种刺激
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1081
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:25,910
她有场冠军赛 对手是"兰熊"
Well, she's got a title shot. The Blue Bear.

1082
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,110
百万美金对半分
Million dollars, split right down the center.

1083
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,080
啊 不错啊 弗兰基 很不错
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1084
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,850
我想找个好助手一起去
Well, I could use a good second.

1085
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,790
但是找不到 所以我来问问你
Can't find one, I thought I'd ask you.

1086
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,050
我他妈为什么会同意呢?
Now, why the hell would I wanna do that?

1087
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,660
因为你是一个 从来没得过冠军的半瞎的老傻瓜
Well, because you're a half- blind old fool who never got there himself.

1088
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:44,560
我想你可能想去体验一下 站在冠军赛的绳圈里的感觉
I thought you might like to feel what it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1089
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:46,730
不好意思 我替你遗憾了
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1090
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,370
我不去 你还是在拉斯维加斯找吧
No, you pick up somebody there in Vegas.

1091
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:53,610
找个年轻点的
Somebody with young hands.

1092
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,840
你不会哭吧? 我已经带上一个女孩了
You're not gonna cry now, are you? I've already got one girl.

1093
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:00,520
如果我离开这地方一天...
I leave this place for one day...

1094
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:03,520
知道回来时这里会变成什么样么?
...got any idea what it would look like when I come back?

1095
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:05,520
和现在这样差不多吧
Kind of like it looks right now.

1096
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,120
噢 去死吧
Oh, go to hell.

1097
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:12,020
告诉麦琪没有拳王腰带不要回来
You tell Maggie don't come back here without a belt.

1098
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,990
知道了
Will do.

1099
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:20,040
嘿 斯科雷普先生
Hey, Mr.Scrap.

1100
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:23,500
我有个问题 可是我觉得问出来好傻
I got a question, but I feel real stupid asking it.

1101
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,910
在这里没有问题是愚蠢的 丹吉尔
No such thing as a stupid question there, Danger.

1102
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,880
好吧
Okay.

1103
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:34,210
你怎么把冰块从这么小的口里放进去的?
How'd you get all the ice in here through this little tiny hole?

1104
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,450
我一直在想
I've been thinking on it.

1105
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,380
但想不出来
Can't figure it out.

1106
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,180
我来做给你看吧 丹吉尔
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1107
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,730
- 你可以 你可以做给我看? - 我想可以 我想可以
- You could do that? You could show me? - I think so. I think so.

1108
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:48,920
还有 斯科雷普先生 我有点觉得我准备好参加比赛了
Also, Mr.Scrap, I was kind of thinking I might be ready for a fight.

1109
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,230
我拿了票 你准备好了么?
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1110
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:58,310
- 我们坐飞机去? - 你宁愿开车?
- We're flying? - Would you rather drive?

1111
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,410
你是问我吗?
You're asking me?

1112
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,810
你是想坐飞机还是开车过去?
Would you rather fly, or would you rather drive?

1113
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,750
我终于有权决定某些事了么?
So I finally get to decide something?

1114
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,320
我说的就是这个意思
That's what I'm saying.

1115
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,080
好吧
Fine.

1116
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,990
好 飞过去 开车回来
Fly there, drive back.

1117
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,020
这是我听过的最愚蠢的事 我们怎么会那么做?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. How the hell we gonna do that?

1118
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,960
你说过让我决定的
You said it was up to me.

1119
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,370
丹吉尔 给他们点颜色
Give them hell there, Danger.

1120
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:34,570
嘿 老家伙 马桶的水溢出来了
Hey, old school, the toilet's overflowing.

Anybody can lose one, son. You'll come back from this.

1149

Come on, don't take the gloves off, man. You ain't even used them, Danger.

1156
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:34,590
能借用一下么 丹吉尔?
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1157
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,570
小子 你是不是叫丹吉尔啊?

1218
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:52,300
你知道绕到外侧 击打肝脏部位的套路吗?
Do you know that step into the outside and hook into the liver?

1219
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:54,170
我一直都这么打的 可她是铜头铁臂
I been doing that. She's made of steel.

Right in the sciatic nerve. Just keep digging it in there.

01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,670
而且要一直缠着她 你听到了么?
And just keep sticking her. You hear that?

1224

就没问题了
...and everything will just be fine.

1226
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,790
比赛是你的 提高警惕
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1227
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,520
保持注意力
You keep it up.

1228
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,470

Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1231
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,860
医生
Doctor.

1232
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:40,870

1235
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:47,610

Good.

1236
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:49,310
看着我 注意看我
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1237
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,320
呼吸
Breathe.

1238
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,510
很好
Good.

1239
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,320
就这样
That's it.

1240
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:57,920
呼吸
Breathe.

1241
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:48,170
亲爱的 感觉怎样?
How you feeling, darling?

1242
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,990
留胡子啦 老板
Growing a beard, boss?

1243
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:02,660
我想可能会增加我的女人缘
I thought it might help me with the ladies.

1244
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,860
很难说哦
Can't say it does.

1245
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,620
会不...会不会很疼?
Does it...? Does it hurt much?

1246
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,620
一点也不
Don't hurt at all.

1247
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:44,190
那很好
Well, that's good.

1248
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:51,470
弗兰基呢?
Where's Frankie?

1249
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,010
他在...
Well, he's...

1250
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:57,580
他在外面和医生谈
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1251
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,840
可能在教他们怎样做好本职工作
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1252
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:07,460
他们在告诉他 我是C1和C2颈椎完全损伤
They're telling him I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1253
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:15,390
就是说我的脊椎断得很彻底 完全没法修复了
Means that my spinal cord's so broke they'll never be able to fix it.

1254
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,630
我下半生都得这么躺着
Gonna be frozen like this the rest of my life.

1255
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:31,510
我叫他们告诉他 我不知道他能不能接受的了
I asked them to tell him. I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1256
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,950
你看了比赛么?
Did you see the fight?

1257
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,220
当然
Of course I did.

1258
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:49,200
你完全压倒了她 麦琪
You had her cold, Maggie.

1259
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,790
我不应该把手放下去的
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1260
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,840
我不该转身的
I shouldn't have turned.

1261
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:08,680
随时保护我自己
Always protect myself.

1262
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:11,980
这句话他和我说了多少遍了
How many times he tell me that?

1263
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,590
是啊...
Yeah...

1264
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:17,820
他说话总是喜欢一遍遍重复
...he does like to repeat himself.

1265
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,930
你能告诉他我很抱歉吗?
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1266
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:30,440
不能
No.

1267
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:33,410
不 我不会这么做的 麦琪
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1268
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,120
真是该死啊
Damnedest thing.

1269
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:00,730
你有什么计划?
So, what's the plan?

1270
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:04,900
我知道你已经计划好了 你还是告诉我的好
I know you got one, so you might as well tell me what it is.

1271
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,840
是你的错
It's your fault.

1272
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:10,440
对 她现在那样躺着 都是你的错
Yeah, it's your fault she's lying in there like that.

1273
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:12,580
你缠着我让我训练她
You kept after me until I trained her.

1274
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:15,990
我知道我不该这么做的 她再怎么说也是个女孩
I knew I shouldn't have done it, her being a girl and all.

1275
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,490
其他的一切也不断向我显示 不要训练她
Everything kept telling me not to.

1276
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,420
除了你
Everything but you.

1277
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:33,530
我要把你从这儿弄出去
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1278
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,670
这里的医生屁都不懂
These doctors around here don't know squat.

1279
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,810
要不然他们为什么要在沙漠里住着?
Otherwise, why would they be living out here in the desert?

1280
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,940
一旦你能被移动了...
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1281
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:45,880
我会找个地方 有人真正学过医的地方
...we'll find some place where they've actually studied medicine.

1282
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:50,720
你就在那里修养好了 我会...
You just rest there, I'II...

1283
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,120
我正在办
I'm on it.

1284
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,600
弗兰基肯定打遍了全美国医院的电话...
Frankie must have called every hospital in America...

1285
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:08,570
寻找能告诉他 她可以被治好的人
...Iooking for somebody who'd tell him they could fix her.

1286
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:12,800
有两次很接近成功 可他们给她做了彻底检查后...
He came close twice, till they checked her over...

1287
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,110
也表示无能为力
...said there was nothing to be done.

1288
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:18,840
两个月后 她病情稳定到可以被移动了
Took two months till she was stable enough to move.

1289
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,650
他们有护士专门做这个 你知道的
They got nurses for that, you know.

1290
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:30,360
可她们太业馀了
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1291
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:46,810
因为不能移动 她长了褥疮
She developed skin ulcers because she couldn't change positions.

1292
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:59,450
谢谢你
Thank you.

1293
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,770
他们坐着救护车 完成了六个小时的旅程
They made the six- hour trip by ambulance.

1294
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:27,020
飞过去 开车回来
Fly there, drive back.

1295
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,820
弗兰基找到的康复中心 是个不错的地方
The rehab center Frankie found was a nice place.

1296
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,090
他们把麦琪照顾地很周到
They took good care of Maggie.

1297
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,360
即使他们没有的话 她也不会抱怨什么
She wouldn 't have complained if they hadn 't.

1298
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:46,590
每天要花几小时才能让她上轮椅
Took several hours every day to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1299
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:54,110
一 二 三 起
One, two, three, up.

1300
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:58,850
由于她无法自主呼吸
Since she couldn't breathe on her own...

1301
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:01,640
呼吸器总是开着
...her respirators were always on.

1302
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:06,720
氧气24小时不间断地 被输进她的身体里
Oxygen was pumped into her 24 hours a day.

1303
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,280
麦琪的妈妈打电话来说 他们会来看她
Maggie's mama called to say they were all coming for a visit.

1304
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:40,080
在接下来的两周里 她每天都在窗前等他们
She waited by the window every day for the next two weeks.

1305
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,360
当然
Sure.

1306
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:45,120
弗兰基最后终于追踪到了他们
Frankie finally tracked them down.

1307
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,290
发现他们六天前就住进旅馆了
Learned they'd checked into their hotel six days earlier.

1308
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:52,830
弗兰基一直给他们留言 但总没有回音
Kept leaving messages which were never returned.

1309
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:59,600
你不用整天都待在这儿
You don't have to hang around all day.

1310
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:06,410
我喜欢这里 没关系的
I like it here. I don't mind.

1311
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:11,110
其实就算你不在 我也会来读书的
In fact, if you weren't here, I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1312
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:16,960
妈妈马上会来分担一些负担的
Mama will be here soon to share some of the burden.

1313
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:19,130
这不是什么负担
Well, it's no burden.

1314
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,500
给
Here.

1315
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:24,830
读读这个
Read this.

1316
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:36,070
好了 好了 行了
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1317
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:38,010
读得太糟糕了
That's terrible.

1318
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,510
我给你翻成英文吧
Anyway, I'll tell you in English what you were saying.

1319
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,890
上面说
It says:

1320
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:51,620
"我要起身去了 去往那茵湖岛"
I will arise and go now And go to Innisfree

1321
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,320
"用泥土和树枝 盖上一间小木房"
And a small cabin build there Of clay and wattles made

1322
01:41:57,230 --> 01:42:01,640
"我享受着彼方的宁静 它缓缓滴零"
And I shall have some peace there For peace comes dropping slow

1323
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:06,940
"从晨曦的面纱 到蟋蟀歌唱的地方"
Dropping from the veils of the morning To where the cricket sings.

1324
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:10,710
还不赖 对吧?
Not bad, huh?

1325
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:17,380
你要盖一间小木屋么 老板?
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1326
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:19,890
- 我? - 对
- Me? - Yeah.

1327
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:24,990
你知道 等你收山之后
You know, when you quit all this.

1328
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,590
你是说拳击?
You mean boxing?

1329
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:31,790
不 我永远不会收山的
No, I'll never quit.

1330
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,290
我太喜欢那汗臭味道了 我想
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1331
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:43,700
你想? 我看你边看书...
You think? Because I could see you there real easy...

1332
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,250
边吃柠檬派很惬意呀
...with your books and lemon pie.

1333
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,320
你呢? 想在小木屋里生活么?
How about you? Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1334
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,620
我可以学怎么烤东西
I could learn how to bake.

1335
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,090
那样的话 我...
Well, then, I'II...

1336
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:03,430
我也许要开始找了
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1337
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,650
是啊
Yeah.

1338
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:31,830
- 去吧 - 好的 听起来不错
- Go ahead. - All right. Okay, sounds good.

1339
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:38,130
嘿 我是弗兰基 邓 我们在密苏里见过
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn. I met you back out in Missouri.

1340
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,600
我女儿在哪?
Where's my little girl?

1341
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:42,600
你们不应该回旅馆换身衣服再来吗?
Don't you think you ought to go back to the hotel and change?

1342
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:45,540
她还不知道你们已经来了一周 忙着拜访米老鼠呢
She doesn't know you've been here a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1343
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:47,370
我们和我妹妹有正事谈
We got business with my sister.

1344
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,170
你干吗不干脆告诉我们她在哪呢?
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1345
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:52,110
你肯定是JD 那你肯定是那个谈正经事的家伙?
Oh, you must be J.D. And you must be the business guy?

1346
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,680
你们错过了一些东西
There's some rides you missed.

1347
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:56,510
你们不如回去 我来告诉她你们来不成了
Why don't you go back. I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1348
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:58,950
我开了这么远的路来照顾孩子
I drove all the way here to take care of my child.

1349
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,280
你却暗示我不是个好母亲?
And you're suggesting I'm not a good mother?

1350
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:03,120
麦琪哪里都去不了
Mary M. Can't go nowhere.

1351
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:06,260
否则我们早带她去逛迪斯尼乐园了
If we could've taken her to Disneyland, we would've.

1352
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,990
麦琪·菲斯杰拉德?
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1353
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:11,160
就在这里 301房间
Right down here, 301.

1354
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:13,160
- 快来 妈妈 - 我们走
- Come on, Mama. - Let's go.

1355
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,770
后来我看到自己呼吸
And I saw myself breathing.

1356
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:23,810
我的身体上下起伏
Like, my body was going up and down.

1357
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:26,810
我想 "为什么没人告诉我?"
I thought, "Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1358
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:33,150
你的头发得洗了 有点太油了
Your hair needs washing. It's kind of greasy.

1359
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,600
只是些...
It's just a...

1360
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,700
只是些法律上的程序
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1361
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:53,210
是什么?
What is it?

1362
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:55,440
你们谈得怎样了?
How we all doing here?

1363
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:58,140
不好意思 亲爱的 我们时间不多
Sorry, darling, but we ain't got a lot of time.

1364
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,480
约翰逊先生收了我们一大笔钱
Mr.Johnson's charging us a lot of money to...

1365
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,480
来保证这件事不出纰漏
...be here to make sure this is done proper.

1366
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,280
你们不如把那个留下 我等会儿读给她听
Why don't you just leave that. I'll read it to her later.

1367
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:07,010
嘿 老家伙
Hey, old man...

1368
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,660
你是我们家人么?
...you part of our family?

1369
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:11,250
别管闲事
Stay the hell out of this.

1370
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:14,590
念给我听 妈妈
Read it to me, Mama.

1371
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:18,330
只是些法律程序 用来保护你的钱的
Well, it's just something legal to protect your money.

1372
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,630
妈妈你不用担心
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1373
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:24,910
拳击协会会支付这里所有的费用的
The boxing commission's paying for all this, everything.

1374
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,400
如果不呢 麦琪?
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1375
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:30,410
约翰逊先生说他们可以收走我的房子
Mr.Johnson says they can take my house.

1376
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:33,740
如果你把财产转移给你母亲 那就没人能动得了了
If you assign your assets to your mother, no one can touch them.

1377
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,750
不用管医生 丧葬费什么的
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1378
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:39,550
- 什么都不用理会了 - 你看 不如你们把这个留下
- Nothing. - Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1379
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:40,990
我以后再读给她...
Then I'll just read it to her later on...

1380
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:43,590
无意冒犯 这不关你的事
With respect, this ain't your business.

1381
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:47,500
好吧 我在走廊里等
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1382
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:56,100
你一直是个好女儿 麦琪
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1383
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:59,470
你签了这份文件
You sign that paper...

1384
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,970
就能照顾你一家
...it'll take care of your family...

1385
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,510
正如你父亲所愿
...the way your daddy would've wanted you to.

1386
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:11,280
你怎么签字呢?
How do you make your mark?

1387
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:15,020
能拿住笔么?
Can you hold a pen?

1388
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:17,560
她只能用牙齿 妈妈
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1389
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:19,790
你得把笔放到她嘴里去
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1390
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,890
好了 亲爱的
Here you go, honey.

1391
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,100
你看了那场比赛么 妈妈?
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1392
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:30,530
亲爱的 你知道我对那东西是什么感觉
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1393
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,670
我打得不错
I did pretty good.

1394
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,710
你输了 麦琪
You lost, Mary M.

1395
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:40,340
听说不是你的错 但你输了
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it, but you lost.

1396
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:44,720
不能把你现在剩下的东西也输掉
Don't wanna lose the rest of what you got left.

1397
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,710
对了
There you go.

1398
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:57,930
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

1399
01:46:58,270 --> 01:46:59,960
这是什么意思?
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1400
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:05,240
妈妈 你带上玛代尔和JD回家吧
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D. And get home.

1401
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:10,410
别等我告诉律师 你担心领不到社会福利...
Before I tell that lawyer that you were so worried about your welfare...

1402
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:13,810
所以根本就没按规定 签那些房产的证明
...you never signed those house papers like you were supposed to.

1403
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:19,050
所以只要我愿意 我可以把房子卖了...
So any time I feel like it, I can sell that house...

1404
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:22,450
不用理你这个又肥又懒的乡巴佬
...from under your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.

1405
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,830
如果你敢再来 我就那么做
And if you ever come back, that's exactly what I'll do.

1406
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:13,270
也许应该有人数点到10
Well, maybe someone ought to count to 10.

1407
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,950
不是很好闻吧 医生?
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1408
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,490
可能保不住了 麦琪
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1409
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:53,340
他们拿掉了我的腿 老板
They took my leg, boss.

1410
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:00,680
不会有事的 听到吗?
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1411
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,920
我总能听到你的声音 老板
I always hear your voice, boss.

1412
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:38,210
需要什么吗?
You need anything?

1413
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:44,620
我想知道"莫库什勒"的意思
I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.

1414
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:48,160
可是你没有赢啊
But you didn't win.

1415
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:50,670
我不用告诉你的
I don't have to tell you.

1416
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,960
你是我见过的最坏的人
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1417
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:59,440
难怪没有人爱你
No wonder no one loves you.

1418
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,410
你让我想起了我父亲
You remind me of my daddy.

1419
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:10,090
他肯定是个...
Well, he must have been...

1420
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:13,890
非常聪明 英俊的人
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1421
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:20,890
你不会再让我读叶芝了 对吧?
You ain't gonna make me talk no more Yeats, are you?

1422
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,230
不 我...
No, I was...

1423
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:28,640
正在看城市大学的宣传材料
...Iooking at this catalog from City College.

1424
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:33,270
我想给你弄个轮椅...
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1425
01:51:33,710 --> 01:51:37,150
可以用吸管控制的那种
...maybe the kind that operates by blowing through a straw.

1426
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:40,920
我想你可能想去上学
I thought maybe you'd like to go back to school.

1427
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:48,390
求你帮个忙 老板
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1428
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:52,360
没问题
Sure.

1429
01:51:53,730 --> 01:51:55,720
什么事都行
Anything you want.

1430
01:51:57,430 --> 01:52:00,400
记得我爸是怎么帮埃克斯的么?
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1431
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,750
想都不要想
Don't even think about that.

1432
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:22,060
我不能像现在这样 弗兰基
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1433
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,060
在我已经成就那么多以后
Not after what I done.

1434
01:52:27,230 --> 01:52:29,220
我见识了整个世界
I seen the world.

1435
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,500
人们高呼我的名字
People chanted my name.

1436
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:36,670
喔...
Well...

1437
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:42,100
不是我的本名 是你给我起的该死的名字
...not my name, some damn name you gave me.

1438
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,580
可他们为我欢呼
But they were chanting for me.

1439
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:53,490
我上过杂志
I was in magazines.

1440
01:52:57,260 --> 01:53:00,020
你以为我以前做过这样的梦么?
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1441
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:08,100
我生出来的时候只有2磅1.5盎司
I was born at 2 pounds, 1 and a half ounces.

1442
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:15,140
爸爸以前总说我是打拼 到这个世界上的...
Daddy used to tell me I fought to get into this world...

1443
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,850
我也会打出一片天地
...and I'd fight my way out.

1444
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:28,720
那是我唯一想做的 弗兰基
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1445
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,360
我只是不想为那个和你打
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1446
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,700
我得到了我要的
I got what I needed.

1447
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:44,160
全部都得到了
I got it all.

1448
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:50,740
别让他们从我身边一点点地拿走
Don't let them keep taking it away from me.

1449
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:00,780
别让我一直躺在这 直到听不见人们的欢呼声为止
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear those people chanting no more.

1450
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,030
我不能
I can't.

1451
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:10,830
求求你
Please.

1452
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:15,360
拜托 不要求我
Please, don't ask me.

1453
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:19,570
我在求呢
I'm asking.

1454
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:25,050
我不能
I can't.

1455
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:10,920
喂?
Hello?

1456
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:18,030
午夜时分...
In the middle of the night...

1457
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:21,530
麦琪自己找到了办法
...Maggie had found her own solution.

1458
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:24,270
她咬舌了
She had bit her tongue.

1459
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:34,210
停下来 停下来
Stop. Stop.

1460
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:40,320
看着我 看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

1461
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:58,250
差点失血过多而死 直到他们把她的伤口缝合
Nearly bled to death before they stitched her up.

1462
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:00,030
在弗兰基到来以前
She came around and...

1463
01:56:00,130 --> 01:56:02,930
她恢复了知觉 把缝上的伤口又撕开了
...ripped them out before Frankie even got there.

1464
01:56:02,930 --> 01:56:05,280
他们又把伤口缝起来
They stitched her up again...

1465
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:09,050
垫起了舌头 以免她再咬舌自尽
...padded the tongue so she couldn't bite.

1466
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:29,700
你不能那么做 你知道的
You can't do it, you know that.

1467
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:33,510
我知道 神父
I do, Father.

1468
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:36,090
可你不知道她有多迟钝
But you don't know how thick she is...

1469
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:39,070
训练她有多难
...how hard it was to train her.

1470
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:43,120
其他拳手你叫他们做什么 他们就做什么
Other fighters would do exactly what you'd say to them...

1471
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:46,680
但她却会问为什么这样 为什么那样
...and she'd ask, why this and why that...

1472
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:49,080
然后还是按自己的方式去做
...and then do it her own way anyway.

1473
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:52,020
她能去争夺冠军 我...
How she fought for the title, I...

1474
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,720
不是靠任何...
It wasn't by anything...

1475
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,920
不是靠听我的话
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1476
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:08,270
但是她现在想死
But now she wants to die...

1477
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,670
而我只想把她留在我身边
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1478
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:19,250
我向上帝起誓 神父
And I swear to God, Father, it's...

1479
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,590
这样做是犯罪
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1480
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:26,160
让她活下去 实际上是在杀死她
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1481
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:29,590
你明白我的意思么? 我怎么才能克服呢?
Do you know what I mean? How do I get around that?

1482
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:33,770
你不需要 你不要插手 弗兰基
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1483
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:35,870
把她交托给上帝
You leave her with God.

1484
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:40,100
她没有求上帝帮忙 她求我帮忙
She's not asking for God's help. She's asking for mine.

1485
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:44,240
23年了 我基本上每天 都能在弥撒上见到你 弗兰基
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass almost every day for 23 years.

1486
01:57:44,450 --> 01:57:46,440
只有那些为了某些事 而不能原谅自己的人
The only person comes to church that much...

1487
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:48,280
才会这么频繁地来教堂
...is the kind who can't forgive himself for something.

1488
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:50,820
无论你身上背负着什么罪
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1489
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,550
都无法和这个相提并论
...they're nothing compared to this.

1490
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:58,320
忘记上帝 天堂和地狱吧
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1491
01:57:58,490 --> 01:58:02,070
如果你那么做 你会迷失的
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1492
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:07,300
深深地迷失
Somewhere so deep...

1493
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:11,540
深到再也找不回自我了
...you'll never find yourself again.

1494
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:20,150
我想我已经是了
I think I did it already.

1495
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,370
我们一直给她镇静剂 好保证她不会再那么做
We're keeping her sedated so she won't try that again.

1496
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:53,240
我今早去看了麦琪
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1497
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:56,970
你一定是去了其他地方
You must have been somewhere else.

1498
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:00,010
是啊
Yeah.

1499
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:05,950
你在和一个我不认识的对手奋战?
You got a fight I don't know about?

1500
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:13,620
那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

1501
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:16,190
我当时那么说是错误的
I was wrong to say that.

1502
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:18,400
你说得真对
You're damn right.

1503
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,130
我给你找到一个拳手
I found you a fighter...

1504
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:24,830
你让她发挥出了最大的潜力
...and you made her the best fighter she could be.

1505
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,880
我杀了她
I killed her.

1506
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:30,910
别那么说
Don't say that.

1507
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:33,840
麦琪走进那扇门的时候 除了胆量什么都没有
Maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts.

1508
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:37,210
根本没有机会实现她的梦想
No chance in the world of being what she needed to be.

1509
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:40,790
一年半以后 她在争夺世界冠军
A year and a half later, she's fighting for the championship of the world.

1510
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,190
是你的功劳
You did that.

1511
02:00:44,430 --> 02:00:46,950
每天都有人死去的 弗兰基
People die every day, Frankie.

1512
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:49,000
拖地的时候 刷碗的时候
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1513
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:51,270
你知道他们最后一个念头是什么吗?
And you know what their last thought is?

1514
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:53,900
"我从没有过机会"
"I never got my shot."

1515
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,700
因为有你 麦琪得到了属于她的机会
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1516
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:01,640
如果她今天就死去 你知道她最后一个念头是什么吗?
If she dies today, you know what her last thought will be?

1517
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:04,880
"我觉得我干得不错"
"I think I did all right."

1518
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:15,050
我会觉得心安理得的
I know I could rest with that.

1519
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:18,790
是啊
Yeah.

1520
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,190
是啊
Yeah.

1521
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,940
是啊
Yeah.

1522
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,610
我去冲杯咖啡
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1523
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:15,270
好
Yeah.

1524
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:43,840
好了
All right.

1525
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:50,490
我会拔掉你的呼吸器...
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1526
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:53,620
然后你就会睡着
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1527
02:02:58,330 --> 02:03:01,060
然后我给你打一针 你就...
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

1528
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:03,760
会一直睡下去
...stay asleep.

1529
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:10,870
"莫库什勒"...
Mo cuishle...

1530
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:16,000
的意思是"我的挚爱 我的血肉"
...means "my darling, my blood."

1531
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:26,910
他只给她打了一针
He gave her a single shot.

1532
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:31,520
肾上腺素的剂量是需要量的好几倍
It was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over.

1533
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:34,720
他不想让她再受一次苦
He didn't want her going through this again.

1534
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:26,270
然后他走出门去
Then he walked out.

1535
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,180
我想他什么都没有了
I don't think he had anything left.

1536
02:05:48,730 --> 02:05:50,960
我回到拳击馆
I went back to the gym.

1537
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:54,930
等待着 认为他总有一天会回来
Waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.

1538
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:17,990
就在那时一个鬼魂走进门来
And that's when a ghost came through the door.

1539
02:06:20,530 --> 02:06:23,590
我想过你说的话了 斯科雷普先生
I got to thinking what you said, Mr.Scrap.

1540
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:26,330
结果呢 丹吉尔?
What was that, Danger?

1541
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:30,530
每个人都会失败的
Anybody can lose one fight.

1542
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:33,610
这是实话
That's the truth.

1543
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:37,000
去吧 戴上手套 你已经很长时间没训练了
Go on, put your gloves on. You missed a lot of training.

1544
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:41,450
好的 斯科雷普先生 没问题
Will do, Mr.Scrap. Sure thing.

1545
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:04,110
弗兰基再也没回来
Frankie never came back at all.

1546
02:07:06,010 --> 02:07:08,680
（凶狠是不够的）

1547
02:07:18,190 --> 02:07:22,690
弗兰基没留下讯息 没人知道他去了哪
Frankie didn't leave a note, and nobody knew where he went.

1548
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:25,390
我希望他是去找你了
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...

1549
02:07:25,390 --> 02:07:28,560
去再次请求你的原谅
...and ask you one more time to forgive him.

1550
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:32,170
但也许他心中什么都没有了
But maybe he didn't have anything left in his heart.

1551
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:36,040
我只希望他能找到个地方 享受片刻的安宁
I just hope he found someplace where he could find a little peace.

1552
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,480
一个雪松和橡树环绕
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1553
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:42,850
比偏僻更偏僻的地方
Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

1554
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:46,920
但那可能只是一厢情愿
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1555
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,450
无论他在哪儿
No matter where he is...

1556
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:55,770
我想你该知道你父亲 究竟是个什么样的人
...I thought you should know what kind of man your father really was.
