1
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:48,614
Do it!

2
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:53,160
You got him! You got him!

3
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,594
<i>I only ever met one man
I wouldn't wanna fight.</i>

4
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,346
I can't stop that.

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,306
Get out of here, you useless tit.

6
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:17,476
<i>When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.</i>

7
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:18,811
Can you stop it?

8
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,314
<i>Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.</i>

9
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:24,108
No.

10
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,534
Let me have a look at him.

11
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,369
He's fine. He's fine.

12
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,871
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

13
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,623
I'll give you one more round.

14
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,670
-Seconds out. Let's go.
-What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,880
You let him hit you.

16
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,178
<i>Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.</i>

17
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:56,515
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.</i>

18
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,268
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

19
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:02,146
<i>...or you just can't get the coagulant
deep enough.</i>

20
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,732
-Come on!
-Break. Break.

21
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:07,610
<i>There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...</i>

22
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,987
<i>...down in the different layers of meat...</i>

23
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,072
<i>...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.</i>

24
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,918
-That's it! Come on!
-What are you doing?

25
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:30,257
Knock him out, Willie!

26
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:40,726
<i>People love violence.</i>

27
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,313
<i>They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,732
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

29
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:49,276
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

30
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:51,904
<i>Boxing is about respect.</i>

31
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:53,906
<i>Getting it for yourself...</i>

32
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,451
<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

33
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:02,831
I'll warm up the car.

34
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,375
Mr. Dunn?

35
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,543
I owe you money?

36
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,003
No, sir.

37
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,672
I know your mama?

38
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,966
Don't rightly know, sir.

39
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:14,593
-Then what is it you want?
-I was on the undercard.

40
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:17,346
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

41
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:20,140
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

42
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,601
-Did you happen to see it?
-Nope.

43
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,270
I did pretty good.

44
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,897
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

45
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,774
I don't train girls.

46
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:32,444
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

47
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:36,532
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

48
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,547
It's a mistake.

49
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,846
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

50
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,473
Just push, will you?

51
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:05,311
-What did Hogan want?
-Offered us a title shot.

52
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,313
About time.

53
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:09,481
I turned him down flat.

54
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,110
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

55
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:20,534
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

56
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,162
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

57
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,331
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

58
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:29,335
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

59
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,129
Whatever you say, Frankie.

60
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,134
<i>Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...</i>

61
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,387
<i>...that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

62
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,682
<i>Sometimes...</i>

63
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:47,519
<i>...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.</i>

64
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:59,031
Well, do your best, Lord...

65
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,367
...protect Katy.

66
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,078
Annie too.

67
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:06,497
Other than that...

68
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:10,626
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

69
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:15,673
<i>But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.</i>

70
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:34,275
-Bye.
-Bye.

71
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,070
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

72
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,738
What's confusing you this week?

73
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,324
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

74
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,786
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

75
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:50,416
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

76
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,753
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

77
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,715
The only reason you come to Mass
is to wind me up.

78
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,925
-It won't happen this morning.
-I'm confused.

79
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,427
-No, you aren't.
-Yes, I am.

80
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,763
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

81
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:06,473
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

82
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,476
-What about the Holy Ghost?
-He's an expression of God's love.

83
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,187
-And Jesus?
-Son of God. Don't play stupid.

84
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,732
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

85
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:17,276
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

86
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,659
-Did you write your daughter?
-Absolutely.

87
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:27,328
Now you're lying to a priest.

88
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,081
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

89
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:45,638
<i>Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

90
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,642
<i>Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart...</i>

91
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,978
<i>...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating. "</i>

92
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:04,740
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

93
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:09,662
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

94
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,705
...out of Broward County, Texas!

95
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:17,211
<i>Danger showed up
a couple of years back.</i>

96
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,092
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

97
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,555
<i>Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

98
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:33,310
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.</i>

99
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:40,234
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

100
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,654
Well, that's nice to hear.

101
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:48,450
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

102
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:52,204
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

103
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,039
...niggers or not.

104
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,834
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

105
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,295
<i>Just one of those questions you ask...</i>

106
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,672
<i>...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.</i>

107
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,884
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

108
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:11,015
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

109
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,933
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

110
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:17,146
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

111
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,982
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

112
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,985
You gotta have at least one fight
to be ranked.

113
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,446
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

114
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,573
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

115
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,742
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

116
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,745
-Shawrelle.
-I will.

117
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,205
Leave him alone.

118
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,626
Danger, you go on back to training.

119
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,545
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

120
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,092
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

121
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,304
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

122
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,806
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

123
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:54,642
Give his mama back her tights.

124
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,646
<i>Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...</i>

125
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,857
<i>...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.</i>

126
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:06,195
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

127
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,657
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

128
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,409
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

129
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:16,997
<i>And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.</i>

130
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,292
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

131
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,002
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

132
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,046
Well, he's hurting me.

133
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:28,425
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

134
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:32,054
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

135
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:35,808
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

136
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,810
It smells better, Frankie.

137
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:40,562
Bleach smells like bleach.

138
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:52,783
-Hey, Scrap.
-Hey, Mr. Willie.

139
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,079
Hey, nice fight last night.

140
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,210
Nice fight.

141
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:08,215
-Big Willie.
-Hey, Sally.

142
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,928
-Nice fight.
-Thanks, man.

143
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,763
People are talking.

144
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:33,490
What the hell kind of language is that?

145
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,409
What do you want?

146
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,913
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

147
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,748
...not talking to another manager.

148
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,293
Not talking to another manager?

149
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,086
And not just any manager.

150
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:48,923
Mickey Mack.

151
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:55,054
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

152
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:57,598
Not a word. Neither one of them.

153
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,851
I'm trying to read here.

154
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,312
Well, if you think that's more important.

155
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,149
Who's your new girl?

156
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,027
What?

157
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,623
Jesus Christ.

158
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,083
Better hurry up.

159
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,086
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

160
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,305
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

161
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:40,140
Thought you might change your mind.

162
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:44,311
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

163
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:47,022
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

164
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,776
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

165
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,654
-Willie, you ready to work?
-Anytime.

166
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,740
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

167
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,076
No.

168
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,161
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

169
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,499
<i>She came from southwestern Missouri...</i>

170
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,712
<i>...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...</i>

171
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:14,883
<i>...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.</i>

172
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:19,179
<i>She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.</i>

173
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:34,486
It's for my dog.

174
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:40,242
<i>She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

175
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,970
Working the bag, boss.

176
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:04,308
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

177
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,282
Give her her money back.

178
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,952
You sure?

179
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:26,080
-How much did she pay?
-Six months.

180
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,583
-Jesus Christ.
-No, I'll give it back.

181
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,253
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

182
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,005
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

183
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,424
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

184
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:40,261
-But just don't encourage her, understand?
-Okay.

185
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:44,181
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

186
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,896
Looks like a bottle of water.

187
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,357
He paid his dues?

188
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:58,070
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

189
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,156
Get out of my office.

190
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,167
Fuck me.

191
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,840
Can't think of it as a bag.

192
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,514
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

193
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:09,808
Appreciate any help I can get.

194
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:15,314
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

195
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,732
And he's constantly moving.

196
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,403
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

197
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,075
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

198
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:29,620
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

199
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,288
So you watch him real carefully.

200
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,791
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

201
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,711
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

202
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:42,633
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

203
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,011
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

204
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:50,099
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

205
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:51,892
-Good, good, good.
-Like that?

206
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,478
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

207
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,108
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

208
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,111
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

209
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:06,031
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

210
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,995
You do have a speed bag.

211
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:24,675
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

212
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,385
All right, you go on home now.

213
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,430
-I'll walk out with you?
-No, I am home.

214
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,849
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

215
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,109
It's nice.

216
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,156
Would it bother you
if I worked a little longer?

217
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,660
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

218
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,664
Thank you.

219
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:13,599
<i>If there's magic in boxing...</i>

220
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:17,353
<i>...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...</i>

221
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:22,858
<i>...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

222
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:38,791
<i>It's the magic of risking everything

223
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,511
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

224
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:52,554
Hey, that's it. That's it.

225
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,598
Hands up.

226
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,643
Jab, jab, jab.

227
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:13,033
Hey, Flip.

228
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,327
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

229
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:18,122
I think I found somebody you can beat.

230
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,335
I don't fights women.

231
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:26,880
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

232
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,675
Because she--
Like, you, you could fight to him...

233
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,510
...and then you could kiss to him.

234
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,345
Then you fight to him one more time.

235
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,265
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

236
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,851
-It's like poetry.
-You been reading and shit.

237
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,562
-Thanks, bro.
-That's a girl, man?

238
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:46,191
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

239
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,028
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

240
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,821
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

241
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,908
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

242
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:03,709
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

243
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,720
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

244
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:20,184
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

245
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,354
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

246
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,232
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

247
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:28,776
Some titties right there, man.

248
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,822
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

249
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:35,574
Punk.

250
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:39,662
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

251
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:45,125
-I'll give you a rubdown.
-Oh, I can't, Frankie.

252
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,337
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

253
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,674
-Something wrong with Gracie's car?
-She hates that car.

254
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,094
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

255
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:56,971
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

256
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,848
I'd appreciate that.

257
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,308
Okay.

258
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:04,270
-Thanks.
-See you later.

259
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,489
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

260
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,450
You ever do any work around here?

261
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:21,912
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

262
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,293
Little girl seems to be coming along.

263
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,423
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

264
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,344
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

265
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:42,683
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

266
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,561
I wonder how the hell she got that.

267
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:47,271
I wonder.

268
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:59,283
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

269
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,994
-This bag?
-Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

270
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:05,039
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

271
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:06,707
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

272
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:08,876
Yes. Yes, it is.

273
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:12,254
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

274
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:15,674
-I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
-Yeah.

275
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,553
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

276
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,013
I understand.

277
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,307
Yeah.

278
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,062
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

279
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,190
-Can I give you some advice?
-I'd appreciate that.

280
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:34,318
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

281
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:36,528
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

282
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,948
It's the latest freak show out there.

283
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:41,492
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

284
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:43,327
...because you're too old.

285
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,038
I don't feel that old.

286
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,708
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21 -year-olds, do you?

287
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:53,379
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

288
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:55,631
How old are you?

289
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:59,677
-Thirty-one until my next birthday.
-Oh, well, there you go.

290
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,428
Thirty-one.

291
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,266
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

292
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:07,393
Already been working it
for three years.

293
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,188
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

294
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,232
Never had any, boss.

295
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,694
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

296
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,904
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

297
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:22,074
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

298
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,909
Yeah.

299
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:28,163
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

300
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,128
-You're not gonna cry now, are you?
-No, sir.

301
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,213
Yeah.

302
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:39,925
Here.

303
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:43,429
-Keep the goddamn thing.
-No, you need it.

304
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,431
No, take the bag.

305
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:48,767
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

306
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:53,355
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

307
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:56,108
-I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
-Yeah.

308
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:58,736
Just don't lose it.

309
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:08,871
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

310
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,874
...your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

311
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,710
...but if I don't see 40 percent--

312
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:19,423
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

313
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,268
-Hey, Willie.
-Hey, Frankie.

314
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:33,020
Something wrong?

315
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:37,066
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

316
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:40,569
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

317
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:43,614
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

318
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,616
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

319
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:49,995
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

320
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,997
Gracie cried when she saw it.

321
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:53,832
Really?

322
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,961
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

323
00:23:57,127 --> 00:24:01,131
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

324
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,175
Everything but the split.

325
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:05,177
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

326
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:08,722
What?

327
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:15,396
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

328
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:19,817
It ain't that, it's--
It's like you said, I got one shot.

329
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:22,945
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

330
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,865
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

331
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:30,661
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

332
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:34,290
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

333
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:38,335
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

334
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:39,712
Only way he'd do it.

335
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:44,425
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

336
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,093
I wish it could've been with me.

337
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:51,891
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

338
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,935
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

339
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:06,447
<i>There's some things people
just don't want to hear.</i>

340
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:22,087
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

341
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:26,592
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

342
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:29,470
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

343
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:33,641
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

344
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:38,312
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

345
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:46,153
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

346
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:51,575
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

347
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,795
<i>No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

348
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,179
I heard about Willie.

349
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:15,558
That's cold. That's dead cold.

350
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:18,686
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

351
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:21,772
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

352
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:24,483
Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

353
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,695
Well, I've got the gym.

354
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:31,240
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

355
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:33,909
Willie tell you why?

356
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:36,996
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

357
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,499
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

358
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,335
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

359
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,504
How's that for not believing in him?

360
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:49,091
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

361
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,343
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

362
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,763
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

363
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,850
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

364
00:26:58,058 --> 00:26:59,393
Not protect him?

365
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,896
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

366
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:05,566
-Yeah.
-Well, now it makes sense.

367
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:09,361
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

368
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,697
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

369
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,200
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

370
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:18,829
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

371
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,123
I had my shot.

372
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,918
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

373
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,294
Yeah, well, I remember.

374
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:29,214
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

375
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:32,593
-...cleaning up other people's spit.
-Yeah, right.

376
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,931
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

377
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:39,141
It's Gaelic.

378
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,394
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

379
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:45,397
How do you say that in Gaelic?

380
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,925
Sorry.

381
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:03,559
Thanks.

382
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:07,980
<i>The action continues as the champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...</i>

383
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:10,107
<i>...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.</i>

384
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:12,985
<i>Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left....</i>

385
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:16,614
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act.</i>

386
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,159
<i>Because everything in it is backwards.</i>

387
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:24,038
<i>You wanna move to the left...</i>

388
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:27,541
<i>...you don't step left,
you push on the right toe.</i>

389
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:32,254
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

390
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:36,383
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...</i>

391
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,968
<i>...you step into it.</i>

392
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:43,515
<i>But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,
he hits the champ with a right hand.</i>

393
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:46,060
<i>And the champ is down.</i>

394
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:48,562
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.</i>

395
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,066
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.</i>

396
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:55,903
<i>It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...</i>

397
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,365
<i>...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.</i>

398
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,078
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

399
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:21,053
Want a cheeseburger?

400
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,972
-You bought me a cheeseburger?
-Yeah.

401
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,224
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

402
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,435
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

403
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:31,647
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

404
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,777
-You watch the fight?
-Yeah, I watched it.

405
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:39,238
Willie did good.

406
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:41,949
That's what you've got to say?

407
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:44,785
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

408
00:30:45,786 --> 00:30:50,124
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

409
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:52,042
You watch it?

410
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:54,420
Yeah, I got HBO.

411
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,715
Now, how can you afford HBO?

412
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,719
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

413
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,388
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

414
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:06,765
...at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

415
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,643
-That true?
-Yeah.

416
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,480
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

417
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:14,940
Don't you remember nothing?

418
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,570
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

419
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:23,657
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

420
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:27,286
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

421
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,955
I had to walk back two miles.

422
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:33,292
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

423
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:38,672
What the hell's that?

424
00:31:39,006 --> 00:31:41,175
It's her birthday.

425
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,533
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

426
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,578
So it's your birthday, huh?

427
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:11,956
How old does that make you?

428
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

429
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:18,754
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

430
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:20,881
...which is what I been doing since 13.

431
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,095
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

432
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:29,014
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

433
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,350
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

434
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,727
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

435
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:37,439
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

436
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:40,192
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

437
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:43,654
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

438
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:48,284
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

439
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:52,204
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

440
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:55,416
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

441
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,043
That enough truth to suit you?

442
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,547
This your speed bag?

443
00:33:01,672 --> 00:33:04,675
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

444
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,180
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

445
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:13,517
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

446
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:15,269
No, sorry.

447
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,938
-You're in a position to negotiate?
-Yes, sir.

448
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:22,067
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

449
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:25,362
I seen you looking at me.

450
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:28,449
-Yeah, out of pity.
-Don't you say that.

451
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:31,493
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

452
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:33,412
I want a trainer.

453
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:37,458
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

454
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:44,924
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

455
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:49,470
Stop, stop, stop.

456
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:53,641
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

457
00:33:57,353 --> 00:33:58,979
Okay.

458
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:00,773
If I'm gonna take you on--

459
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:04,401
-You won't never regret it.
-Look, just listen to me.

460
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,404
-lf I take you on--
-I promise I'll work so hard.

461
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,949
God, this is a mistake already.

462
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:13,577
I'm listening, boss.

463
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:18,999
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

464
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:23,212
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

465
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:26,465
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

466
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,841
That's all I ask.

467
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,511
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

468
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,305
-Alrighty.
-We got a deal.

469
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,641
No, not quite.

470
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,768
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

471
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:40,646
...then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

472
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:44,441
-I hate to argue with you, but--
-Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

473
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,320
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

474
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:51,490
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

475
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:54,868
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

476
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,579
It's the only way I'll do it.

477
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,005
All right.

478
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:12,094
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

479
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:15,514
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

480
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:17,850
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

481
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,853
So here's what you do.

482
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:23,522
You get yourself--
Bend your knees a little bit.

483
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:27,568
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

484
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:32,823
-Move them how, boss?
-Just ... Go ... Hit the bag.

485
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,535
-Stop.
-What'd I do wrong?

486
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:38,829
Okay, you did two things wrong.

487
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:42,333
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

488
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:46,712
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

489
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:50,799
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

490
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:52,551
You can count with me if you want.

491
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,554
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

492
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,765
-Can you show me that again?
-I just--

493
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,975
Just say "one," please.

494
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,602
-One.
-Okay.

495
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,604
-One. Okay.
-One.

496
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:06,899
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

497
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:11,737
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

498
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:17,159
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

499
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:22,665
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

500
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,459
And ice pick maneuver again.

501
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:28,671
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

502
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:32,925
Don't watch anything but my feet.

503
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:47,940
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

504
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:21,807
<i>You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

505
00:37:30,232 --> 00:37:33,944
<i>To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.</i>

506
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:35,571
Rest when you're dead.

507
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:37,406
Come here.

508
00:37:41,952 --> 00:37:44,580
<i>You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know...</i>

509
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:47,791
<i>...you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.</i>

510
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,214
<i>Make them so tired
they only listen to you.</i>

511
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:58,427
<i>Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.</i>

512
00:37:58,552 --> 00:37:59,803
Move your feet.

513
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,972
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

514
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:20,199
<i>Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.</i>

515
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:24,119
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

516
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:31,210
<i>How to generate momentum
off your right toe.</i>

517
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:35,714
<i>And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

518
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:46,308
<i>How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn't wanna come after you.</i>

519
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,061
<i>Then you gotta show them
all over again.</i>

520
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,480
<i>Over and over and over...</i>

521
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:54,608
<i>...till they think they were born that way.</i>

522
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:57,653
Shift.

523
00:38:57,778 --> 00:38:59,738
Shift away.

524
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:03,909
Okay. That's enough for today.

525
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:07,538
Good work. Good girl.

526
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:11,458
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

527
00:39:33,981 --> 00:39:37,484
Hey. Hey, come here.

528
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,488
You're not breathing.

529
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,825
Hate to disagree with you.

530
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:48,287
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

531
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:51,874
-Now, stop doing that.
-Okay.

532
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,335
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

533
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:58,422
-I mean, for a girl.
-I don't train girls.

534
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:03,385
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

535
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:07,097
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

536
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,267
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

537
00:40:17,191 --> 00:40:19,985
-Got any family, boss?
-What?

538
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:25,866
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

539
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:28,160
No.

540
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,164
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

541
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:34,166
That's family.

542
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,044
We're not exactly close.

543
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:38,963
How much she weigh?

544
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:41,548
What?

545
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:44,885
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

546
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:48,889
Yeah.

547
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:51,225
Not very big.

548
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:55,479
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

549
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:05,114
So, what do you think?

550
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:07,199
I ready for a fight?

551
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:14,707
Hey, Sally.

552
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,835
Come here for a minute, will you?

553
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:22,548
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

554
00:41:23,257 --> 00:41:26,594
-Can I see you a minute?
-Sally here's a real good manager.

555
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,723
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

556
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,850
I'm looking for a good one.

557
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:36,186
Well, see, there you go.

558
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:40,774
Nice working with you, girlie.

559
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:46,989
-What'd you want?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

560
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:51,243
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work.
You got a hell of a left.

561
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,078
Thank you.

562
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:58,626
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

563
00:42:00,794 --> 00:42:03,964
-Yeah, sure.
-Good.

564
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,634
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

565
00:42:18,854 --> 00:42:20,397
Break.

566
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,777
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

567
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:27,655
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

568
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:31,075
-I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
-You're wearing her down.

569
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:34,620
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

570
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,165
-Come on.
-Do it.

571
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,918
Come on, let's do this!

572
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:46,298
That's it!

573
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,391
Nice night, eh?

574
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:58,477
Jesus Christ.

575
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:00,521
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

576
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:02,481
Hell of a fighter.

577
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:04,692
11-0.

578
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:06,860
Your left. Keep your left up.

579
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,742
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

580
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:16,996
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

581
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:18,706
Yeah.

582
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:20,916
Your left, damn it.

583
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:26,463
Wouldn't have been my choice for
her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

584
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:29,341
-He must think she can take her.
-Jesus H.

585
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,177
Your left. Keep your left up.

586
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:35,598
You think she can hear you
from back here?

587
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:46,400
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

588
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:48,569
Might even help him.

589
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:50,654
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

590
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:55,409
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

591
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:57,995
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

592
00:43:58,162 --> 00:43:59,622
Hey, what do I know?

593
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:02,541
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

594
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:05,210
Mother of God.

595
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:07,630
Okay, break.

596
00:44:07,796 --> 00:44:10,132
Hey. Come here, come here.

597
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,759
Hey. Get over here.

598
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:14,762
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

599
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:17,598
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

600
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:21,185
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

601
00:44:21,685 --> 00:44:23,270
Dunn.

602
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:25,981
-What are you doing?
-I'm talking. What are you doing?

603
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:28,067
-Is this your fighter?
-It's my fighter.

604
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,570
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

605
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:34,907
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

606
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:39,453
-Somebody tell me what's going on.
-I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

607
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,081
You telling me this is your fighter?

608
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,627
Yeah, this is my fighter.

609
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:48,545
Then you got 10 seconds.

610
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:51,966
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

611
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:54,218
-Well, let it drop.
-That'd be a lot easier.

612
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:55,594
She thinks she knows you.

613
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:58,764
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

614
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:02,142
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

615
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:05,312
-When she cocks that right hand ...
You hear? -I hear you, boss.

616
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:08,482
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

617
00:45:08,649 --> 00:45:10,025
-Got one?
-Got it right here.

618
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:12,987
-Okay.
-Fight, or I'm calling it.

619
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:16,115
<i>-Go give it to her.
-The body knows what fighters don't.</i>

620
00:45:16,282 --> 00:45:17,491
<i>How to protect itself.</i>

621
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,452
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

622
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:23,831
<i>Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:</i>

623
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,210
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don't know what you're doing. "</i>

624
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:30,212
Neutral corner.

625
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:33,549
-See the way she did that?
-Yeah.

626
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:36,635
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

627
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:42,516
<i>"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses. "</i>

628
00:45:42,683 --> 00:45:44,852
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

629
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:48,772
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

630
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:50,900
Thanks, boss.

631
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:53,611
You.... You forgot the rule.

632
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:56,155
-Now, what is the rule?
-Keep my left up?

633
00:45:56,363 --> 00:45:59,325
It's to protect yourself at all times.

634
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:01,452
Now, what is the rule?

635
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,997
-Protect myself at all times.
-Good, good.

636
00:46:05,164 --> 00:46:07,333
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

637
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,210
It wasn't.

638
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:12,796
It's okay.

639
00:46:13,547 --> 00:46:17,384
-I'll work on my left, boss.
-Drink your water.

640
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:20,221
Other than that, how'd I do?

641
00:46:20,596 --> 00:46:23,515
Fine. You did fine.

642
00:46:24,475 --> 00:46:25,976
You gonna leave me again?

643
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,813
Never.

644
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,360
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

645
00:46:34,902 --> 00:46:37,571
-Sure.
-Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

646
00:46:37,738 --> 00:46:41,367
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

647
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:46,914
-I want you to take the weekend off.
-It's only Thursday.

648
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:51,794
-You gonna argue with me?
-Know better than to do that, boss.

649
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:54,171
Well, good.

650
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:57,049
<i>All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.</i>

651
00:46:57,466 --> 00:47:00,886
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

652
00:47:01,095 --> 00:47:05,349
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

653
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:10,771
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong...</i>

654
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:13,941
<i>...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...</i>

655
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:18,946
<i>...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

656
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:22,449
-Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
-You sure did, boss.

657
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:24,285
That was last night.

658
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:27,246
You said not to argue with you.

659
00:47:38,716 --> 00:47:41,385
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

660
00:47:41,552 --> 00:47:43,512
You want my advice?

661
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,139
What?

662
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,558
Where are your shoes?

663
00:47:48,976 --> 00:47:50,978
I'm airing out my feet.

664
00:47:52,688 --> 00:47:54,565
You got big holes in your socks.

665
00:47:55,608 --> 00:47:57,568
Oh, they're not that big.

666
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:01,614
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

667
00:48:03,324 --> 00:48:04,950
These are my sleeping socks.

668
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:08,996
My feet like a little air at night.

669
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:11,832
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

670
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:15,002
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

671
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:22,885
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

672
00:48:23,177 --> 00:48:24,845
Please?

673
00:48:27,181 --> 00:48:31,060
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

674
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:33,145
Might find its way to the track.

675
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:52,873
It's over. It's over.

676
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:10,391
<i>Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.</i>

677
00:49:21,902 --> 00:49:23,279
I got the breathing thing down.

678
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:27,032
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

679
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,703
-Thought that was the point.
-The point is to get good.

680
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,998
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

681
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:36,375
How am I gonna get you fights?

682
00:49:38,127 --> 00:49:40,462
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

683
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:43,257
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

684
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:46,010
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

685
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:49,430
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

686
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:56,604
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

687
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,898
<i>...just to let her know who was boss.</i>

688
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:05,946
Three, four, five...

689
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:08,240
...six, seven....

690
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:10,034
Sorry, boss.

691
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,244
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

692
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:24,423
All right, let's do it.

693
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:29,553
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

694
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,111
Get up!

695
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:47,947
To your corner.

696
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:51,283
-Three, four, five...
-Get up.

697
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:53,744
-...six, seven...
-Get up.

698
00:50:53,911 --> 00:50:56,956
-...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
-You can do this.

699
00:50:58,207 --> 00:51:02,670
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

700
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:07,007
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

701
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:14,139
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...</i>

702
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:18,310
<i>...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

703
00:51:30,364 --> 00:51:32,783
<i>That only worked for so long.</i>

704
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,078
<i>Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.</i>

705
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,288
<i>He took a chance.</i>

706
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,875
Box.

707
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:48,674
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

708
00:51:48,883 --> 00:51:51,719
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

709
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,025
Watch the right!

710
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:10,529
Watch it. Watch it.

711
00:52:17,494 --> 00:52:21,373
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

712
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:32,384
Damn, damn, damn.

713
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:36,305
Give us two seconds, will you?

714
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:38,224
-Okay.
-Just two seconds.

715
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:41,227
-Your nose is broke.
-Oh, damn.

716
00:52:41,435 --> 00:52:43,187
-Fix it.
-I can't, I can't.

717
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:45,898
-You can fix it.
-I can't. I've gotta call it.

718
00:52:46,106 --> 00:52:47,983
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

719
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:51,195
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

720
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,905
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

721
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:56,325
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

722
00:52:57,743 --> 00:52:59,620
Bite down on this.

723
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,265
-Inhale.
-What?

724
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:20,891
-Inhale.
-What?

725
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:23,018
Breathe in.

726
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,032
-Okay, huh?
-Yeah, it's okay.

727
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:40,327
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

728
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:42,621
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

729
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,040
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

730
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:46,917
Now get going.

731
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:01,515
Go to your corner.

732
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:05,477
Three, four, five...

733
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:09,315
-Come on, breathe. Breathe.
-...six, seven, eight...

734
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:11,609
...nine, ten.

735
00:54:14,987 --> 00:54:16,447
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>

736
00:54:22,036 --> 00:54:23,787
-All right!
-Yeah!

737
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:27,041
Right.

738
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,047
What you reading?

739
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:35,216
What's she saying?

740
00:54:35,758 --> 00:54:38,052
Wants to know what you're reading.

741
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:41,180
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

742
00:54:42,097 --> 00:54:44,016
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

743
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:46,810
Show her what a treat that is.

744
00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:49,396
When the hell they gonna get to her?

745
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:51,774
I'm okay, Frankie.

746
00:54:52,566 --> 00:54:55,527
-What'd you learn tonight?
-Always protect myself.

747
00:54:55,694 --> 00:54:58,781
-What's the rule?
-Always protect myself.

748
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:00,824
-Margaret Fitzgerald?
-Here.

749
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:07,289
I'll be right here.

750
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,720
-How you doing?
-Me?

751
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:23,847
-Yeah, you.
-I'm not the one who's hurt.

752
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:30,521
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

753
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:33,566
Why are you telling me that?

754
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:37,069
No reason.

755
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,490
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

756
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:46,287
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

757
00:55:46,495 --> 00:55:49,832
-Did you write your daughter?
-Every week.

758
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:54,378
I've no idea why you come to church.

759
00:56:25,576 --> 00:56:30,331
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

760
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:35,502
<i>The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...</i>

761
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:37,963
<i>...for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

762
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:41,759
Billie "The Blue Bear."

763
00:56:41,884 --> 00:56:45,012
<i>Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.</i>

764
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:49,391
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

765
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:09,286
<i>Didn't seem to matter to her...</i>

766
00:57:09,411 --> 00:57:12,081
<i>...that something like that
could kill a person.</i>

767
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:15,209
<i>And the crowds loved her.</i>

768
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,048
<i>He turned it down
without even telling her.</i>

769
00:57:21,257 --> 00:57:23,551
<i>The next was to fight
the British champ...</i>

770
00:57:23,676 --> 00:57:26,971
<i>-...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.
-Hello?</i>

771
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:29,765
Not interested.

772
00:57:32,643 --> 00:57:35,145
<i>He turned that down too.</i>

773
00:57:37,356 --> 00:57:39,692
That's a lot of money, boss.

774
00:57:39,858 --> 00:57:43,279
Yeah, you're making money.
What are you still working here for?

775
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:45,155
It's a title match, right?

776
00:57:45,322 --> 00:57:48,325
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

777
00:57:48,492 --> 00:57:51,870
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

778
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:55,207
Might still be a good fight.

779
00:57:55,374 --> 00:57:58,878
Yeah, I just ... I just brought you up
to welterweight.

780
00:57:59,086 --> 00:58:02,506
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

781
00:58:02,715 --> 00:58:05,676
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

782
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,680
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

783
00:58:10,764 --> 00:58:13,684
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

784
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:16,395
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

785
00:58:19,773 --> 00:58:23,277
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

786
00:58:53,224 --> 00:58:55,017
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

787
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,895
I made us a reservation.

788
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,732
You might wanna shower.

789
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:25,256
Here you go.

790
00:59:25,422 --> 00:59:27,299
Here you go.

791
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,510
What's this?

792
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:32,972
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

793
00:59:33,514 --> 00:59:34,974
Go on and blow.

794
00:59:39,853 --> 00:59:41,647
Thank you.

795
00:59:45,734 --> 00:59:48,237
Thirty-three ain't so old.

796
00:59:48,946 --> 00:59:51,824
I was still fighting at 39.

797
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:55,619
Fought for 23 years.

798
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:01,041
How's it going, Scrap?

799
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,877
Doing good, Mickey.

800
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:05,754
Doing good.

801
01:00:07,172 --> 01:00:09,675
-What'll you have?
-Coffee.

802
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,474
You two not speaking?

803
01:00:17,892 --> 01:00:20,144
Don't hardly know him.

804
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:29,278
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

805
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:32,823
He was picking up cut work.

806
01:00:33,824 --> 01:00:37,536
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

807
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:40,873
Good man to have in your corner.

808
01:00:41,832 --> 01:00:43,751
Yes, he is.

809
01:00:45,336 --> 01:00:48,547
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

810
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:52,760
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

811
01:00:53,302 --> 01:00:56,805
...and it was just Frankie and me.

812
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:01,477
I was taking a hellacious beating.

813
01:01:02,937 --> 01:01:06,273
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

814
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:09,902
Nobody tells you what that number is.

815
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:13,530
Mine was 109.

816
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:16,408
I just didn't want to admit it.

817
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,496
Fourth round, this...

818
01:01:21,205 --> 01:01:22,623
...cut opens up.

819
01:01:23,082 --> 01:01:25,876
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

820
01:01:27,795 --> 01:01:31,757
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

821
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:34,093
Blood was what I was there for.

822
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:38,556
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

823
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:41,141
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

824
01:01:41,267 --> 01:01:44,645
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

825
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:47,940
Round after round...

826
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:50,401
...he's arguing with me.

827
01:01:51,819 --> 01:01:55,906
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

828
01:01:56,824 --> 01:01:59,326
I go 15 rounds...

829
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:01,704
...Iose by decision.

830
01:02:02,413 --> 01:02:04,748
Next morning, I lose the eye.

831
01:02:07,293 --> 01:02:10,754
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

832
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:15,801
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

833
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:18,470
Somehow...

834
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,057
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

835
01:02:22,933 --> 01:02:25,311
...should've saved my eye.

836
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:31,609
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

837
01:02:32,484 --> 01:02:35,362
I wanted to go to 110.

838
01:02:35,988 --> 01:02:37,990
Thing is...

839
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:40,451
...if you wanna get to the title...

840
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:44,413
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

841
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:51,754
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

842
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:57,218
You go on, eat your cupcake.

843
01:02:57,384 --> 01:03:00,137
No, I got it.

844
01:03:05,684 --> 01:03:07,019
<i>It's the rule.</i>

845
01:03:07,228 --> 01:03:09,647
<i>Always protect yourself.</i>

846
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:12,983
<i>People never take their own advice.</i>

847
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:18,197
<i>If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.</i>

848
01:03:22,576 --> 01:03:24,536
Mr. Mickey Mack?

849
01:03:24,703 --> 01:03:27,039
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

850
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:33,087
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

851
01:03:33,504 --> 01:03:36,549
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

852
01:03:37,508 --> 01:03:40,511
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

853
01:03:42,555 --> 01:03:44,974
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

854
01:03:48,686 --> 01:03:52,815
<i>Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.</i>

855
01:04:26,056 --> 01:04:29,935
<i>The letters always came back
marked the same way:</i>

856
01:04:30,102 --> 01:04:32,271
<i>"Return to sender. "</i>

857
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,303
I'll make you some coffee.

858
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:07,973
What are you doing with your money?

859
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:10,684
-Saving it.
-Good girl.

860
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:15,940
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

861
01:05:16,106 --> 01:05:17,399
Cash, no mortgage.

862
01:05:17,566 --> 01:05:20,152
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

863
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,492
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

864
01:05:26,617 --> 01:05:29,286
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

865
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:32,706
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

866
01:05:33,123 --> 01:05:34,583
You understand?

867
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:38,671
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

868
01:05:38,837 --> 01:05:40,798
Okay, soon as I get the money.

869
01:05:40,965 --> 01:05:45,010
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just
trying to keep you from doing the same.

870
01:05:45,511 --> 01:05:47,096
I know, boss.

871
01:05:48,472 --> 01:05:50,933
-I'm not gonna live forever.
-What is it?

872
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,769
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

873
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:57,231
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to ... Hey.

874
01:05:57,398 --> 01:06:00,109
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

875
01:06:00,276 --> 01:06:02,903
-Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

876
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:07,491
You're welcome, darling. Here, just--
Here, let me put this in the machine.

877
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,660
What machine?

878
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:11,870
Don't have a TV, huh?

879
01:06:12,037 --> 01:06:13,789
No.

880
01:06:14,498 --> 01:06:16,250
Yeah!

881
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:19,461
All right. Okay.

882
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:27,970
-Ten minutes, love.
-Thank you.

883
01:06:28,345 --> 01:06:29,763
Man says he loves me.

884
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:31,974
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

885
01:06:32,224 --> 01:06:34,435
First since my daddy.

886
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:36,729
I win, you think he'll propose?

887
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:39,189
You win, I'll propose.

888
01:06:43,068 --> 01:06:44,987
Look, I got you a gift here.

889
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,036
I think they gave you somebody else's.

890
01:06:52,202 --> 01:06:54,163
No, no, this is it.

891
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:56,665
What's it mean?

892
01:06:56,832 --> 01:07:00,628
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

893
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:05,299
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah, I thought so.

894
01:07:05,466 --> 01:07:07,301
-Yeah.
-Real silk thread.

895
01:07:10,888 --> 01:07:15,267
From the United States
of America, the challenger...

896
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:18,771
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

897
01:07:20,522 --> 01:07:22,608
<i>Mo cuishle.
Did you see what was on her robe?</i>

898
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:25,027
<i>-Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
-Mo cuishle.</i>

899
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,075
<i>She wasn't the main attraction.</i>

900
01:07:31,242 --> 01:07:34,954
<i>She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.</i>

901
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:37,289
<i>But ask someone who was there...</i>

902
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:40,459
<i>...they couldn't tell you who else
fought that night.</i>

903
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:48,300
Box.

904
01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:10,364
<i>-Come on!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

905
01:08:11,031 --> 01:08:15,244
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

906
01:08:16,453 --> 01:08:18,038
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

907
01:08:19,373 --> 01:08:20,457
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

908
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:25,296
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

909
01:08:34,138 --> 01:08:35,848
She's tough.

910
01:08:37,516 --> 01:08:40,019
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

911
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:42,605
-You know why that is?
-Why?

912
01:08:43,063 --> 01:08:45,024
She's a better fighter than you are.

913
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:49,278
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

914
01:08:49,445 --> 01:08:51,655
...what are you gonna do about it?

915
01:08:59,705 --> 01:09:01,457
Get in there.

916
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:03,751
Box.

917
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:22,186
Three, four, five, six...

918
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:27,483
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

919
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:31,779
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

920
01:09:38,911 --> 01:09:42,248
<i>-Mo cuishle!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

921
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:51,590
I could ask someone, you know?

922
01:09:52,174 --> 01:09:53,509
Good.

923
01:09:53,676 --> 01:09:55,719
You find out, you let me know.

924
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:05,729
<i>Whatever it meant, the name stuck.</i>

925
01:10:05,896 --> 01:10:10,401
<i>Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.</i>

926
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:13,404
<i>It was always mo cuishle.</i>

927
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:16,031
<i>Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...</i>

928
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:18,492
<i>...or people who wanna be.</i>

929
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:21,412
<i>By the time they came back
to the States...</i>

930
01:10:22,288 --> 01:10:25,374
<i>...Maggie was in a whole new league.</i>

931
01:10:42,474 --> 01:10:46,937
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

932
01:10:56,822 --> 01:10:59,950
<i>After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.</i>

933
01:11:02,286 --> 01:11:04,205
What's the split?

934
01:11:04,788 --> 01:11:07,208
-Sixty-forty.
-Good.

935
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:11,337
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

936
01:11:11,837 --> 01:11:13,255
That little girl?

937
01:11:13,631 --> 01:11:17,009
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

938
01:11:17,176 --> 01:11:20,971
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

939
01:11:21,138 --> 01:11:24,183
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

940
01:11:31,732 --> 01:11:33,442
There you go.

941
01:11:36,362 --> 01:11:40,115
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

942
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:42,660
How's that girl doing?

943
01:11:42,826 --> 01:11:45,955
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

944
01:11:46,121 --> 01:11:48,040
She be all right?

945
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:52,127
-And if she isn't?
-Maybe I should send her something.

946
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:56,423
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

947
01:12:01,428 --> 01:12:03,222
Boss?

948
01:12:03,389 --> 01:12:05,266
That little house we talked about?

949
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:07,101
I bought it.

950
01:12:07,768 --> 01:12:10,145
Well, smart girl.

951
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:14,608
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

952
01:12:14,733 --> 01:12:16,860
No mortgage, just like you said.

953
01:12:19,154 --> 01:12:21,240
You're a good daughter.

954
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:23,951
She don't know about it yet.

955
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:27,705
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

956
01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:29,790
I know she wants to meet you.

957
01:12:32,459 --> 01:12:35,004
Yeah, we could do that.

958
01:12:52,062 --> 01:12:55,232
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

959
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:57,568
Mary M.'s here.

960
01:13:14,627 --> 01:13:18,714
-This is the Johnsons' old house.
-Not anymore.

961
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:26,222
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

962
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:30,226
-Mary M., you bought this for me?
-Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

963
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:32,102
Darling....

964
01:13:32,269 --> 01:13:34,605
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

965
01:13:34,772 --> 01:13:37,066
They'll be here before you move in.

966
01:13:38,317 --> 01:13:40,653
-How much money did this cost you?
-Never mind that.

967
01:13:40,861 --> 01:13:43,530
-You shouldn't have done this.
-You need a decent place.

968
01:13:43,697 --> 01:13:47,034
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

969
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:51,622
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

970
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:55,668
-Mama, no, they ain't.
-They are. You're fine, you're working...

971
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:57,670
...but I can't live without my welfare.

972
01:13:57,795 --> 01:13:59,505
Mama, I'll send you money.

973
01:13:59,797 --> 01:14:03,050
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

974
01:14:03,259 --> 01:14:06,887
-How am I supposed to get my medicine?
-I'll send you more money.

975
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:09,515
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

976
01:14:09,682 --> 01:14:10,933
He's getting out, you know.

977
01:14:11,684 --> 01:14:14,103
Why didn't you just give me the money?

978
01:14:15,104 --> 01:14:17,773
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

979
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:23,445
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

980
01:14:23,696 --> 01:14:25,823
You want the money, sell it.

981
01:14:32,371 --> 01:14:33,998
I don't--

982
01:14:40,546 --> 01:14:42,464
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

983
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:45,050
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

984
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:48,721
-That's true, Mama.
-I'll try and keep the house.

985
01:14:49,221 --> 01:14:51,557
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

986
01:14:51,724 --> 01:14:53,642
I'll send you some more money.

987
01:15:02,818 --> 01:15:05,070
That man hitting you?

988
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:08,741
It's from the fight.

989
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:10,701
I'm a fighter, Mama.

990
01:15:11,577 --> 01:15:13,495
Find a man, Mary M.

991
01:15:13,704 --> 01:15:15,331
Live proper.

992
01:15:15,497 --> 01:15:18,500
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

993
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:21,754
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

994
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:15,266
Hi.

995
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:47,673
You ever own a dog?

996
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,341
Nope.

997
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:54,138
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

998
01:16:56,181 --> 01:17:00,519
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

999
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:02,438
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1000
01:17:02,563 --> 01:17:06,191
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

1001
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:09,361
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1002
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:13,324
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1003
01:17:13,824 --> 01:17:17,620
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1004
01:17:18,954 --> 01:17:22,541
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1005
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:27,087
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1006
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,342
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1007
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:34,136
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1008
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:41,894
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1009
01:17:50,903 --> 01:17:53,364
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1010
01:17:56,617 --> 01:17:58,536
Well, you've got me.

1011
01:18:00,996 --> 01:18:05,167
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1012
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:17,054
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1013
01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:19,098
Yeah.

1014
01:18:19,682 --> 01:18:22,601
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1015
01:18:22,768 --> 01:18:25,729
None of that canned-filling crap.

1016
01:18:40,286 --> 01:18:42,955
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1017
01:18:47,835 --> 01:18:49,753
I used to come here with Daddy.

1018
01:18:50,963 --> 01:18:53,507
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1019
01:18:53,632 --> 01:18:56,218
I got a little bit of savings.

1020
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:05,769
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1021
01:19:10,482 --> 01:19:12,610
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1022
01:19:13,402 --> 01:19:15,654
Looks like another bottle of water.

1023
01:19:15,821 --> 01:19:18,115
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1024
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:23,245
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1025
01:19:23,495 --> 01:19:27,082
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1026
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:29,251
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1027
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:31,253
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1028
01:19:31,378 --> 01:19:33,005
Well, I could use a good second.

1029
01:19:33,172 --> 01:19:34,965
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1030
01:19:35,132 --> 01:19:37,218
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1031
01:19:37,718 --> 01:19:41,764
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1032
01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:45,684
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1033
01:19:45,851 --> 01:19:47,853
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1034
01:19:49,063 --> 01:19:51,523
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1035
01:19:53,025 --> 01:19:54,777
Somebody with young hands.

1036
01:19:54,902 --> 01:19:57,947
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1037
01:19:59,823 --> 01:20:01,659
I leave this place for one day...

1038
01:20:01,867 --> 01:20:04,662
...got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1039
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,664
Kind of like it looks right now.

1040
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:08,249
Oh, go to hell.

1041
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:13,170
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1042
01:20:13,587 --> 01:20:15,172
Will do.

1043
01:20:19,218 --> 01:20:21,220
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1044
01:20:21,387 --> 01:20:24,640
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1045
01:20:24,848 --> 01:20:27,059
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1046
01:20:27,226 --> 01:20:29,019
Okay.

1047
01:20:31,313 --> 01:20:35,359
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1048
01:20:35,568 --> 01:20:37,611
I've been thinking on it.

1049
01:20:37,736 --> 01:20:39,530
Can't figure it out.

1050
01:20:39,738 --> 01:20:41,365
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1051
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:44,827
-You could do that? You could show me?
-I think so. I think so.

1052
01:20:45,035 --> 01:20:50,040
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1053
01:20:53,919 --> 01:20:56,380
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1054
01:20:56,589 --> 01:20:59,466
-We're flying?
-Would you rather drive?

1055
01:21:00,843 --> 01:21:02,553
You're asking me?

1056
01:21:03,178 --> 01:21:05,973
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1057
01:21:06,599 --> 01:21:08,893
So I finally get to decide something?

1058
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:10,436
That's what I'm saying.

1059
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,229
Fine.

1060
01:21:12,396 --> 01:21:14,148
Fly there, drive back.

1061
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:18,193
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1062
01:21:18,485 --> 01:21:20,112
You said it was up to me.

1063
01:21:30,289 --> 01:21:32,541
Give them hell there, Danger.

1064
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:35,711
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1065
01:21:40,049 --> 01:21:42,885
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1066
01:21:44,887 --> 01:21:46,597
Jesus.

1067
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:49,475
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1068
01:21:49,975 --> 01:21:52,102
Oh, God!

1069
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,775
Dumb-ass.

1070
01:21:58,192 --> 01:22:00,569
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1071
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:02,196
Come on. Defense!

1072
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:05,115
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1073
01:22:05,908 --> 01:22:07,826
...drinking mai tais...

1074
01:22:08,661 --> 01:22:10,204
...Iooking at naked women.

1075
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:13,582
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1076
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,295
Danger, get out of there!

1077
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:27,471
Fight back! Come on!

1078
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,307
-There you go, Danger, there you go!
-Good job, man.

1079
01:22:30,975 --> 01:22:32,476
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

1080
01:22:32,685 --> 01:22:33,894
Come on.

1081
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:44,530
Hey, come on now, Flip.

1082
01:22:44,697 --> 01:22:46,824
-What you doing? Let him go.
-All right. Okay.

1083
01:22:47,032 --> 01:22:49,326
I got you. Come on, come on.

1084
01:22:50,953 --> 01:22:52,454
It's all right.

1085
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:55,499
We don't need no corner trainer.

1086
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:57,042
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1087
01:22:57,209 --> 01:22:59,128
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1088
01:22:59,295 --> 01:23:01,422
You my man. You rock.

1089
01:23:01,547 --> 01:23:03,549
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

1090
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:06,468
You ain't even fight good yet.

1091
01:23:06,635 --> 01:23:08,554
Anybody can lose one fight.

1092
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:11,223
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

1093
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,975
You'll be champion of the world.

1094
01:23:13,225 --> 01:23:15,477
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1095
01:23:16,437 --> 01:23:18,105
I should have knowed.

1096
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:20,858
-Come on. We don't need to be talking.
-Let me help you.

1097
01:23:21,025 --> 01:23:24,570
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1098
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:26,655
All right.

1099
01:23:28,073 --> 01:23:31,577
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1100
01:23:33,037 --> 01:23:35,748
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1101
01:23:36,332 --> 01:23:38,709
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1102
01:23:39,418 --> 01:23:41,003
Come on, now.

1103
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:45,174
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1104
01:23:45,758 --> 01:23:49,345
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1105
01:23:57,102 --> 01:24:00,231
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1106
01:24:01,398 --> 01:24:02,650
Keep going, man.

1107
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:04,568
All right, man.

1108
01:24:11,909 --> 01:24:13,369
He ain't so tough.

1109
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,663
One hundred and ten.

1110
01:24:20,584 --> 01:24:22,211
Get a job, punk.

1111
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:56,662
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1112
01:24:57,663 --> 01:24:59,748
I got you some pipers.

1113
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:17,266
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1114
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:21,770
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1115
01:25:30,571 --> 01:25:32,031
All right, now!

1116
01:26:21,914 --> 01:26:24,333
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1117
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,585
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1118
01:26:42,768 --> 01:26:46,063
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...</i>

1119
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,524
...presentation of the evening.

1120
01:26:48,691 --> 01:26:53,195
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1121
01:26:53,654 --> 01:26:55,447
...in the red corner.

1122
01:26:55,656 --> 01:26:57,241
In the blue corner...

1123
01:26:57,408 --> 01:27:01,787
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1124
01:27:01,954 --> 01:27:04,832
...Billie "The Blue Bear."

1125
01:27:08,002 --> 01:27:09,795
Sweet Jesus.

1126
01:27:25,436 --> 01:27:28,939
<i>Fitzgerald is pushing The Blue Bear
around the ring. She's coming on strong.</i>

1127
01:27:31,817 --> 01:27:34,904
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1128
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:37,156
<i>-And a right hook stuns the champ.
-All right.</i>

1129
01:27:39,241 --> 01:27:40,534
Break it up!

1130
01:27:43,495 --> 01:27:45,497
Break it! Break it!

1131
01:27:51,503 --> 01:27:54,381
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1132
01:27:56,508 --> 01:27:57,843
Go fight.

1133
01:28:05,809 --> 01:28:07,645
You motherfucker.

1134
01:28:15,819 --> 01:28:18,280
Come on. What the fuck?

1135
01:28:18,447 --> 01:28:21,116
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1136
01:28:21,367 --> 01:28:23,577
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1137
01:28:25,204 --> 01:28:26,789
<i>--comes back, hits Fitzgerald....</i>

1138
01:28:26,956 --> 01:28:28,374
Ref, open your eyes, you....

1139
01:28:46,392 --> 01:28:50,145
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the first round
is in the books on this championship match.</i>

1140
01:28:53,649 --> 01:28:56,026
-Hold onto that.
-There you go.

1141
01:29:00,823 --> 01:29:03,200
-Looking good.
-You pull that crap one more time...

1142
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:05,119
...you're disqualified.

1143
01:29:13,377 --> 01:29:14,962
It's gonna be all right.

1144
01:29:15,087 --> 01:29:16,881
Got no doubt, boss.

1145
01:29:19,758 --> 01:29:22,261
Okay, just watch yourself.

1146
01:29:22,469 --> 01:29:23,888
Stay away from this dame.

1147
01:29:36,358 --> 01:29:39,069
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1148
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:43,407
-Four, five, six...
-Stay down, you bitch.

1149
01:29:43,532 --> 01:29:46,952
...seven, eight, nine.

1150
01:29:59,924 --> 01:30:01,383
Yeah, yeah!

1151
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,553
Break it! Break it!

1152
01:30:11,477 --> 01:30:15,231
<i>Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion....</i>

1153
01:30:29,078 --> 01:30:30,788
Yes! Come on!

1154
01:30:31,163 --> 01:30:32,498
I got it! I got it.

1155
01:30:39,255 --> 01:30:40,631
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1156
01:30:40,798 --> 01:30:43,592
-How many eyes you need to finish this?
-One's enough.

1157
01:30:46,971 --> 01:30:48,639
-Good.
-Now...

1158
01:30:48,847 --> 01:30:50,349
...what do I do about the Bear?

1159
01:30:50,516 --> 01:30:53,477
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1160
01:30:53,644 --> 01:30:57,189
-I been doing that. She's made of steel.
-I don't want you to go to the liver.

1161
01:30:57,398 --> 01:31:00,276
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1162
01:31:00,526 --> 01:31:03,571
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1163
01:31:03,737 --> 01:31:05,823
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1164
01:31:06,198 --> 01:31:08,993
-What about the ref?
-Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1165
01:31:09,159 --> 01:31:10,911
...and everything will just be fine.

1166
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,957
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1167
01:31:15,124 --> 01:31:16,625
You keep it up.

1168
01:31:30,264 --> 01:31:31,640
Oh, yeah!

1169
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:44,278
Break, break!

1170
01:31:51,076 --> 01:31:54,747
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1171
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,986
Doctor.

1172
01:32:40,793 --> 01:32:42,044
Come on.

1173
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:43,921
Breathe.

1174
01:32:44,129 --> 01:32:46,674
That's it. Breathe.

1175
01:32:47,132 --> 01:32:48,759
Good.

1176
01:32:48,968 --> 01:32:50,427
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1177
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:52,429
Breathe.

1178
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,682
Good.

1179
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,433
That's it.

1180
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:59,103
Breathe.

1181
01:33:47,526 --> 01:33:49,320
How you feeling, darling?

1182
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:00,164
Growing a beard, boss?

1183
01:34:00,956 --> 01:34:03,792
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1184
01:34:05,753 --> 01:34:07,963
Can't say it does.

1185
01:34:35,366 --> 01:34:37,785
Does it--? Does it hurt much?

1186
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,789
Don't hurt at all.

1187
01:34:43,707 --> 01:34:45,376
Well, that's good.

1188
01:34:50,965 --> 01:34:52,633
Where's Frankie?

1189
01:34:54,718 --> 01:34:56,178
Well, he's....

1190
01:34:56,345 --> 01:34:58,722
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1191
01:34:58,889 --> 01:35:01,976
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1192
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:08,607
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1193
01:35:11,861 --> 01:35:16,574
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1194
01:35:20,202 --> 01:35:23,789
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1195
01:35:28,794 --> 01:35:32,631
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1196
01:35:41,098 --> 01:35:43,100
Did you see the fight?

1197
01:35:45,686 --> 01:35:47,396
Of course I did.

1198
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:50,357
You had her cold, Maggie.

1199
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:54,904
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1200
01:35:58,824 --> 01:36:00,993
I shouldn't have turned.

1201
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,835
Always protect myself.

1202
01:36:10,002 --> 01:36:13,130
How many times he tell me that?

1203
01:36:14,298 --> 01:36:15,758
Yeah...

1204
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,969
...he does like to repeat himself.

1205
01:36:22,765 --> 01:36:26,101
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1206
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:31,607
No.

1207
01:36:32,316 --> 01:36:34,568
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1208
01:36:54,713 --> 01:36:56,257
Damnedest thing.

1209
01:37:00,135 --> 01:37:01,887
So, what's the plan?

1210
01:37:02,763 --> 01:37:06,058
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1211
01:37:06,225 --> 01:37:08,018
It's your fault.

1212
01:37:08,561 --> 01:37:11,564
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1213
01:37:11,772 --> 01:37:13,691
You kept after me until I trained her.

1214
01:37:14,233 --> 01:37:17,152
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1215
01:37:18,195 --> 01:37:20,614
Everything kept telling me not to.

1216
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:22,575
Everything but you.

1217
01:37:33,002 --> 01:37:34,712
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1218
01:37:34,879 --> 01:37:36,839
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1219
01:37:36,964 --> 01:37:39,967
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

1220
01:37:40,843 --> 01:37:43,053
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1221
01:37:43,429 --> 01:37:47,057
...we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1222
01:37:49,935 --> 01:37:51,896
You just rest there, I'II....

1223
01:37:53,689 --> 01:37:55,274
I'm on it.

1224
01:38:04,366 --> 01:38:06,702
<i>Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...</i>

1225
01:38:06,952 --> 01:38:09,705
<i>...looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.</i>

1226
01:38:09,914 --> 01:38:13,959
<i>He came close twice,
till they checked her over...</i>

1227
01:38:14,293 --> 01:38:16,295
<i>...said there was nothing to be done.</i>

1228
01:38:16,754 --> 01:38:19,965
<i>Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.</i>

1229
01:38:25,304 --> 01:38:27,806
They got nurses for that, you know.

1230
01:38:29,225 --> 01:38:31,518
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1231
01:38:43,656 --> 01:38:47,952
<i>She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn't change positions.</i>

1232
01:38:59,004 --> 01:39:00,589
Thank you.

1233
01:39:10,558 --> 01:39:13,894
<i>They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.</i>

1234
01:39:25,281 --> 01:39:28,158
Fly there, drive back.

1235
01:39:34,498 --> 01:39:37,960
<i>The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.</i>

1236
01:39:38,419 --> 01:39:40,254
<i>They took good care of Maggie.</i>

1237
01:39:40,379 --> 01:39:42,464
<i>She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn't.</i>

1238
01:39:43,799 --> 01:39:47,720
<i>Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.</i>

1239
01:39:52,975 --> 01:39:55,269
One, two, three, up.

1240
01:39:57,688 --> 01:39:59,982
<i>Since she couldn't breathe on her own...</i>

1241
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:02,818
<i>...her respirators were always on.</i>

1242
01:40:04,028 --> 01:40:07,865
<i>Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.</i>

1243
01:40:34,058 --> 01:40:37,436
<i>Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.</i>

1244
01:40:37,561 --> 01:40:41,232
<i>She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.</i>

1245
01:40:42,233 --> 01:40:43,526
Sure.

1246
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:46,278
<i>Frankie finally tracked them down.</i>

1247
01:40:46,445 --> 01:40:50,449
<i>Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.</i>

1248
01:40:50,616 --> 01:40:53,953
<i>Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.</i>

1249
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,751
You don't have to hang around all day.

1250
01:41:04,588 --> 01:41:07,550
I like it here. I don't mind.

1251
01:41:08,259 --> 01:41:12,221
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1252
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:18,102
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1253
01:41:18,435 --> 01:41:20,271
Well, it's no burden.

1254
01:41:21,230 --> 01:41:22,606
Here.

1255
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:25,985
Read this.

1256
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,246
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1257
01:41:37,705 --> 01:41:39,164
That's terrible.

1258
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:44,670
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1259
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:49,008
It says:

1260
01:41:49,174 --> 01:41:52,761
<i>I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree</i>

1261
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:57,474
<i>And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made</i>

1262
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:02,813
<i>And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow</i>

1263
01:42:03,355 --> 01:42:08,110
<i>Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.</i>

1264
01:42:10,446 --> 01:42:11,864
Not bad, huh?

1265
01:42:16,368 --> 01:42:18,537
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1266
01:42:19,205 --> 01:42:21,040
-Me?
-Yeah.

1267
01:42:23,417 --> 01:42:26,170
You know, when you quit all this.

1268
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,757
You mean boxing?

1269
01:42:30,341 --> 01:42:32,927
No, I'll never quit.

1270
01:42:33,928 --> 01:42:36,472
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1271
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:44,855
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1272
01:42:45,064 --> 01:42:47,399
...with your books and lemon pie.

1273
01:42:49,568 --> 01:42:52,488
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1274
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:56,784
I could learn how to bake.

1275
01:43:00,746 --> 01:43:02,248
Well, then, I'II....

1276
01:43:02,414 --> 01:43:04,542
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1277
01:43:26,313 --> 01:43:27,815
Yeah.

1278
01:43:30,609 --> 01:43:32,987
-Go ahead.
-All right. Okay, sounds good.

1279
01:43:36,907 --> 01:43:39,243
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1280
01:43:39,451 --> 01:43:40,744
Where's my little girl?

1281
01:43:40,953 --> 01:43:43,747
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1282
01:43:43,956 --> 01:43:46,709
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1283
01:43:46,876 --> 01:43:50,337
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1284
01:43:50,462 --> 01:43:53,257
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

1285
01:43:53,424 --> 01:43:54,842
There's some rides you missed.

1286
01:43:55,009 --> 01:43:57,636
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1287
01:43:57,845 --> 01:44:00,097
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1288
01:44:00,306 --> 01:44:02,433
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1289
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,268
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

1290
01:44:04,435 --> 01:44:07,438
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1291
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:10,149
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1292
01:44:10,649 --> 01:44:12,318
Right down here, 301.

1293
01:44:12,651 --> 01:44:14,320
-Come on, Mama.
-Let's go.

1294
01:44:20,826 --> 01:44:22,912
And I saw myself breathing.

1295
01:44:23,078 --> 01:44:24,955
Like, my body was going up and down.

1296
01:44:25,122 --> 01:44:27,958
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1297
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:34,256
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1298
01:44:48,395 --> 01:44:49,730
It's just a....

1299
01:44:50,731 --> 01:44:52,816
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1300
01:44:53,067 --> 01:44:54,360
What is it?

1301
01:44:54,527 --> 01:44:56,612
How we all doing here?

1302
01:44:56,737 --> 01:44:59,281
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

1303
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:03,661
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1304
01:45:03,827 --> 01:45:06,455
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

1305
01:45:06,622 --> 01:45:08,123
Hey, old man...

1306
01:45:08,374 --> 01:45:09,833
...you part of our family?

1307
01:45:10,751 --> 01:45:12,419
Stay the hell out of this.

1308
01:45:14,004 --> 01:45:15,756
Read it to me, Mama.

1309
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:19,468
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

1310
01:45:20,219 --> 01:45:21,804
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1311
01:45:22,638 --> 01:45:26,058
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1312
01:45:26,392 --> 01:45:28,519
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1313
01:45:28,727 --> 01:45:31,522
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1314
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:34,900
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1315
01:45:35,067 --> 01:45:36,902
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1316
01:45:37,695 --> 01:45:40,656
-Nothing.
-Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1317
01:45:40,906 --> 01:45:44,702
-Then I'll just read it to her later on--
-With respect, this ain't your business.

1318
01:45:46,245 --> 01:45:48,664
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1319
01:45:54,879 --> 01:45:57,256
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1320
01:45:58,883 --> 01:46:00,634
You sign that paper...

1321
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:03,095
...it'll take care of your family...

1322
01:46:03,429 --> 01:46:05,681
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1323
01:46:10,436 --> 01:46:12,396
How do you make your mark?

1324
01:46:14,982 --> 01:46:16,192
Can you hold a pen?

1325
01:46:16,317 --> 01:46:18,736
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1326
01:46:18,903 --> 01:46:20,946
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1327
01:46:22,364 --> 01:46:24,074
Here you go, honey.

1328
01:46:27,203 --> 01:46:29,246
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1329
01:46:29,538 --> 01:46:31,665
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1330
01:46:33,209 --> 01:46:34,793
I did pretty good.

1331
01:46:35,002 --> 01:46:36,837
You lost, Mary M.

1332
01:46:37,755 --> 01:46:41,508
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

1333
01:46:43,135 --> 01:46:45,846
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

1334
01:46:46,305 --> 01:46:47,890
There you go.

1335
01:46:57,149 --> 01:46:59,109
What happened to you?

1336
01:46:59,443 --> 01:47:01,111
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1337
01:47:02,988 --> 01:47:06,367
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

1338
01:47:08,244 --> 01:47:11,539
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1339
01:47:11,747 --> 01:47:14,959
...you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1340
01:47:17,795 --> 01:47:20,214
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

1341
01:47:20,381 --> 01:47:23,592
...from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

1342
01:47:25,678 --> 01:47:28,931
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1343
01:48:10,306 --> 01:48:14,435
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

1344
01:48:27,948 --> 01:48:30,075
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1345
01:48:33,037 --> 01:48:34,663
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1346
01:49:51,615 --> 01:49:54,493
They took my leg, boss.

1347
01:49:59,373 --> 01:50:01,792
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1348
01:50:02,668 --> 01:50:06,046
I always hear your voice, boss.

1349
01:50:37,828 --> 01:50:39,371
You need anything?

1350
01:50:43,167 --> 01:50:45,753
<i>I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.</i>

1351
01:50:47,546 --> 01:50:49,340
But you didn't win.

1352
01:50:49,882 --> 01:50:51,800
I don't have to tell you.

1353
01:50:55,554 --> 01:50:58,140
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1354
01:50:58,307 --> 01:51:00,601
No wonder no one loves you.

1355
01:51:04,146 --> 01:51:06,565
You remind me of my daddy.

1356
01:51:09,235 --> 01:51:11,195
Well, he must have been...

1357
01:51:11,737 --> 01:51:15,032
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1358
01:51:18,869 --> 01:51:22,039
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1359
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:25,376
No, I was...

1360
01:51:26,877 --> 01:51:29,797
...Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1361
01:51:32,091 --> 01:51:34,426
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1362
01:51:34,885 --> 01:51:38,305
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1363
01:51:39,098 --> 01:51:42,059
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1364
01:51:47,147 --> 01:51:49,567
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1365
01:51:51,777 --> 01:51:53,529
Sure.

1366
01:51:54,905 --> 01:51:56,866
Anything you want.

1367
01:51:58,617 --> 01:52:01,579
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1368
01:52:14,383 --> 01:52:16,927
Don't even think about that.

1369
01:52:20,806 --> 01:52:23,225
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1370
01:52:26,437 --> 01:52:28,230
Not after what I done.

1371
01:52:28,397 --> 01:52:30,399
I seen the world.

1372
01:52:33,444 --> 01:52:35,654
People chanted my name.

1373
01:52:36,655 --> 01:52:37,823
Well...

1374
01:52:39,783 --> 01:52:43,245
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1375
01:52:46,248 --> 01:52:48,751
But they were chanting for me.

1376
01:52:52,254 --> 01:52:54,632
I was in magazines.

1377
01:52:58,385 --> 01:53:01,180
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1378
01:53:05,559 --> 01:53:09,271
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1379
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:16,278
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1380
01:53:19,657 --> 01:53:21,951
...and I'd fight my way out.

1381
01:53:26,914 --> 01:53:29,875
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1382
01:53:32,002 --> 01:53:34,505
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1383
01:53:37,466 --> 01:53:38,842
I got what I needed.

1384
01:53:42,846 --> 01:53:45,266
I got it all.

1385
01:53:48,853 --> 01:53:51,897
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

1386
01:53:56,986 --> 01:54:01,949
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1387
01:54:06,912 --> 01:54:09,206
I can't.

1388
01:54:09,874 --> 01:54:12,001
Please.

1389
01:54:14,044 --> 01:54:16,505
Please, don't ask me.

1390
01:54:18,632 --> 01:54:20,718
I'm asking.

1391
01:54:24,305 --> 01:54:26,181
I can't.

1392
01:55:10,059 --> 01:55:12,019
Hello?

1393
01:55:17,233 --> 01:55:19,527
<i>In the middle of the night...</i>

1394
01:55:19,693 --> 01:55:22,696
<i>...Maggie had found her own solution.</i>

1395
01:55:23,239 --> 01:55:25,407
<i>She had bit her tongue.</i>

1396
01:55:32,498 --> 01:55:35,376
Stop. Stop.

1397
01:55:38,837 --> 01:55:41,465
Look at me. Look at me.

1398
01:55:55,771 --> 01:55:59,567
<i>Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.</i>

1399
01:55:59,984 --> 01:56:04,363
<i>She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.</i>

1400
01:56:04,655 --> 01:56:06,824
<i>They stitched her up again...</i>

1401
01:56:06,991 --> 01:56:10,160
<i>...padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.</i>

1402
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:30,848
You can't do it, you know that.

1403
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:34,643
I do, Father.

1404
01:56:35,603 --> 01:56:37,605
But you don't know how thick she is...

1405
01:56:37,730 --> 01:56:40,316
...how hard it was to train her.

1406
01:56:40,691 --> 01:56:44,612
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1407
01:56:44,737 --> 01:56:50,242
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1408
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:53,204
How she fought for the title, I....

1409
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:54,872
It wasn't by anything....

1410
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:58,042
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1411
01:57:07,134 --> 01:57:09,386
But now she wants to die...

1412
01:57:09,595 --> 01:57:11,847
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1413
01:57:16,185 --> 01:57:20,397
And I swear to God, Father, it's....

1414
01:57:20,898 --> 01:57:23,692
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1415
01:57:23,901 --> 01:57:27,321
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1416
01:57:27,696 --> 01:57:30,699
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1417
01:57:32,076 --> 01:57:34,870
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1418
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:36,997
You leave her with God.

1419
01:57:37,706 --> 01:57:41,252
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1420
01:57:41,418 --> 01:57:45,381
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1421
01:57:45,589 --> 01:57:47,591
The only person comes
to church that much...

1422
01:57:47,758 --> 01:57:49,426
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1423
01:57:49,593 --> 01:57:51,971
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1424
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:54,932
...they're nothing compared to this.

1425
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:59,436
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1426
01:57:59,645 --> 01:58:02,731
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1427
01:58:06,193 --> 01:58:08,404
Somewhere so deep...

1428
01:58:10,281 --> 01:58:12,658
...you'll never find yourself again.

1429
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:21,292
I think I did it already.

1430
01:58:43,147 --> 01:58:46,525
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1431
01:59:51,674 --> 01:59:54,385
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1432
01:59:56,136 --> 01:59:58,138
You must have been somewhere else.

1433
01:59:59,306 --> 02:00:01,183
Yeah.

1434
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:07,106
You got a fight I don't know about?

1435
02:00:12,528 --> 02:00:14,780
It wasn't your fault.

1436
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:17,366
I was wrong to say that.

1437
02:00:17,616 --> 02:00:19,577
You're damn right.

1438
02:00:20,953 --> 02:00:22,246
I found you a fighter...

1439
02:00:22,454 --> 02:00:26,000
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

1440
02:00:28,586 --> 02:00:30,045
I killed her.

1441
02:00:30,212 --> 02:00:32,089
Don't say that.

1442
02:00:32,423 --> 02:00:35,009
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1443
02:00:35,175 --> 02:00:38,387
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

1444
02:00:38,512 --> 02:00:41,932
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1445
02:00:42,099 --> 02:00:43,350
You did that.

1446
02:00:45,561 --> 02:00:48,105
People die every day, Frankie.

1447
02:00:48,272 --> 02:00:50,149
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1448
02:00:50,482 --> 02:00:52,443
And you know what
their last thought is?

1449
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:55,070
"I never got my shot."

1450
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:57,823
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1451
02:00:59,116 --> 02:01:02,786
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

1452
02:01:03,662 --> 02:01:05,998
"I think I did all right."

1453
02:01:13,631 --> 02:01:16,175
I know I could rest with that.

1454
02:01:18,886 --> 02:01:19,929
Yeah.

1455
02:01:20,512 --> 02:01:22,306
Yeah.

1456
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,110
Yeah.

1457
02:02:13,315 --> 02:02:14,775
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1458
02:02:14,942 --> 02:02:16,402
Yeah.

1459
02:02:43,387 --> 02:02:44,972
All right.

1460
02:02:49,143 --> 02:02:51,645
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1461
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:54,773
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1462
02:02:59,486 --> 02:03:02,239
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

1463
02:03:03,282 --> 02:03:04,909
...stay asleep.

1464
02:03:10,247 --> 02:03:12,041
<i>Mo cuishle...</i>

1465
02:03:13,542 --> 02:03:17,171
...means "my darling, my blood."

1466
02:04:25,281 --> 02:04:28,033
<i>He gave her a single shot.</i>

1467
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:32,663
<i>It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.</i>

1468
02:04:32,997 --> 02:04:35,875
<i>He didn't want her
going through this again.</i>

1469
02:05:25,716 --> 02:05:27,426
<i>Then he walked out.</i>

1470
02:05:28,052 --> 02:05:31,305
<i>I don't think he had anything left.</i>

1471
02:05:49,907 --> 02:05:52,117
<i>I went back to the gym.</i>

1472
02:05:52,409 --> 02:05:56,080
<i>Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.</i>

1473
02:06:15,724 --> 02:06:19,144
<i>And that's when a ghost
came through the door.</i>

1474
02:06:21,689 --> 02:06:24,733
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

1475
02:06:25,818 --> 02:06:27,444
What was that, Danger?

1476
02:06:29,113 --> 02:06:31,699
Anybody can lose one fight.

1477
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:34,785
That's the truth.

1478
02:06:35,578 --> 02:06:38,163
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1479
02:06:40,124 --> 02:06:42,626
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1480
02:07:01,437 --> 02:07:04,565
<i>Frankie never came back at all.</i>

1481
02:07:19,330 --> 02:07:23,459
<i>Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.</i>

1482
02:07:23,834 --> 02:07:26,378
<i>I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...</i>

1483
02:07:26,503 --> 02:07:29,548
<i>...and ask you one more time
to forgive him.</i>

1484
02:07:29,673 --> 02:07:33,177
<i>But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.</i>

1485
02:07:33,344 --> 02:07:36,680
<i>I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.</i>

1486
02:07:37,181 --> 02:07:40,267
<i>A place set in the cedars and oak trees.</i>

1487
02:07:40,643 --> 02:07:43,812
<i>Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.</i>

1488
02:07:43,979 --> 02:07:47,566
<i>But that's probably wishful thinking.</i>

1489
02:07:48,025 --> 02:07:50,027
<i>No matter where he is...</i>

1490
02:07:50,611 --> 02:07:55,366
<i>...I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.</i>
