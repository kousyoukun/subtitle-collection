1
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:10,594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

2
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,319
Do it!

3
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:55,829
You got him! You got him!

4
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:13,247
I only ever met one man
I wouldn 't wanna fight.

5
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,012
I can't stop that.

6
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:16,982
Get out of here, you useless tit.

7
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:20,126
When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.

8
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,522
Can you stop it?

9
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:25,028
Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.

10
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,789
No.

11
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,238
Let me have a look at him.

12
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:38,067
He's fine. He's fine.

13
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,537
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

14
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:42,313
I'll give you one more round.

15
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:47,383
- Seconds out. Let's go.
- What do we do? Tell me what to do.

16
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,584
You let him hit you.

17
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,820
Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.

18
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:59,159
Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.

19
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,925
Maybe you got a severed vein...

20
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,831
...or you just can 't get the coagulant
deep enough.

21
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:07,440
- Come on!
- Break. Break.

22
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:10,270
There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...

23
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,674
...down in the different layers of meat...

24
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,746
...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.

25
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,556
- That' s it! Come on!
- What are you doing?

26
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:32,956
Knock him out, Willie!

27
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,403
People love violence.

28
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,972
They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.

29
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,411
Same people claim to love boxing.

30
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,915
They got no idea what it is.

31
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,579
Boxing is about respect.

32
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:56,589
Getting it for yourself...

33
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:00,090
...and taking it away from the other guy.

34
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,463
I'll warm up the car.

35
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,065
Mr. Dunn?

36
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:09,231
I owe you money?

37
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,665
No, sir.

38
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,327
I know your mama?

39
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,631
Don't rightly know, sir.

40
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,276
- Then what is it you want?
- I was on the undercard.

41
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,038
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

42
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,773
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

43
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,308
- Did you happen to see it?
- Nope.

44
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:26,918
I did pretty good.

45
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:29,578
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

46
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,485
I don't train girls.

47
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:35,116
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

48
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:39,163
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

49
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:54,180
It's a mistake.

50
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,517
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

51
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,181
Just push, will you?

52
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,984
- What did Hogan want?
- Offered us a title shot.

53
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:10,026
About time.

54
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:12,165
I turned him down flat.

55
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,766
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,232
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

57
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,805
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

58
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,970
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

59
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,981
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

60
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,812
Whatever you say, Frankie.

61
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,818
Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,095
...that everything in boxing is backwards.

63
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,323
Sometimes...

64
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,230
...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.

65
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,675
Well, do your best, Lord...

66
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,046
...protect Katy.

67
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,718
Annie too.

68
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,179
Other than that...

69
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:13,320
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

70
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:18,356
But step back too far,
you ain 't fighting at all.

71
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:36,949
- Bye.
- Bye.

72
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:40,748
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

73
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,388
What's confusing you this week?

74
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:45,024
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

75
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:48,423
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

76
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:53,089
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,463
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

78
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,402
The only reason you come to Mass
is to wind me up.

79
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:02,633
- It won't happen this morning.
- I'm confused.

80
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,106
- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.

81
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:07,474
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

82
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,114
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

83
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:12,115
- What about the Holy Ghost?
- He's an expression of God's love.

84
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:14,879
- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid.

85
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,420
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

86
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,957
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

87
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,301
- Did you write your daughter?
- Absolutely.

88
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,026
Now you're lying to a priest.

89
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,762
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

90
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,319
Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.

91
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,322
Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter
who 's nothing but heart...

92
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,655
...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating."

93
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:07,434
Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.

94
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:12,300
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

95
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,344
...out of Broward County, T exas!

96
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,910
Danger showed up
a couple of years back.

97
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:25,782
He'd come visiting L.A. With Ervel,
his mama 's new boyfriend.

98
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:31,228
Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.

99
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:35,991
Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.

100
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:42,903
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

101
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,344
Well, that's nice to hear.

102
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:51,106
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

103
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:54,879
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

104
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:56,716
...niggers or not.

105
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:59,517
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

106
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,990
Just one of those questions you ask...

107
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:04,323
...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.

108
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:08,524
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

109
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:13,700
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

110
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:15,568
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

111
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:19,838
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

112
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,641
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

113
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,647
You gotta have at least one fight
to be ranked.

114
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,151
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

115
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,249
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

116
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,414
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

117
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,454
- Shawrelle.
- I will.

118
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,862
Leave him alone.

119
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:41,323
Danger, you go on back to training.

120
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,198
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

121
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:49,771
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

122
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,007
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

123
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,476
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

124
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,309
Give his mama back her tights.

125
00:08:57,484 --> 00:09:01,284
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...

126
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:04,521
...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.

127
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:08,883
Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.

128
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:12,361
Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.

129
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,096
Bobby died while he was packing.

130
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:19,669
And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.

131
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,933
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

132
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,701
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

133
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,744
Well, he's hurting me.

134
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:31,077
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

135
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,753
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

136
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,516
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

137
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,488
It smells better, Frankie.

138
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,226
Bleach smells like bleach.

139
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:55,440
- Hey, Scrap.
- Hey, Mr. Willie.

140
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,735
Hey, nice fight last night.

141
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:05,850
Nice fight.

142
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,849
- Big Willie.
- Hey, Sally.

143
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,622
- Nice fight.
- Thanks, man.

144
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:17,456
People are talking.

145
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,140
What the hell kind of language is that?

146
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,082
What do you want?

147
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,543
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

148
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:43,416
...not talking to another manager.

149
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,991
Not talking to another manager?

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,787
And not just any manager.

151
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,556
Mickey Mack.

152
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:57,698
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

153
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,303
Not a word. Neither one of them.

154
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,542
I'm trying to read here.

155
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,974
Well, if you think that's more important.

156
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:09,781
Who's your new girl?

157
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,716
What?

158
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,287
Jesus Christ.

159
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,796
Better hurry up.

160
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,799
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

161
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,008
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

162
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,773
Thought you might change your mind.

163
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,011
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

164
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:49,678
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

165
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:53,451
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

166
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,356
- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.

167
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,425
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

168
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,767
No.

169
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:03,835
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

170
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,169
She came from southwestern Missouri...

171
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:12,368
...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...

172
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,580
...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

173
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:21,880
She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.

174
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,163
It's for my dog.

175
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:42,898
She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

176
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,658
Working the bag, boss.

177
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:06,993
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

178
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,971
Give her her money back.

179
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,608
You sure?

180
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,743
- How much did she pay?
- Six months.

181
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,283
- Jesus Christ.
- No, I'll give it back.

182
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,892
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

183
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,689
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

184
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:40,094
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

185
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,894
- But just don't encourage her, understand?
- Okay.

186
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:46,861
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

187
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,607
Looks like a bottle of water.

188
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,070
He paid his dues?

189
00:13:56,816 --> 00:14:00,775
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

190
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,855
Get out of my office.

191
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,827
Fuck me.

192
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:02,510
Can't think of it as a bag.

193
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:10,217
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

194
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,483
Appreciate any help I can get.

195
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:17,962
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

196
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,428
And he's constantly moving.

197
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:24,059
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

198
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:28,765
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

199
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,274
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

200
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:33,969
So you watch him real carefully.

201
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,445
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

202
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:40,347
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

203
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,287
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

204
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:48,654
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

205
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,731
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

206
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,560
- Good, good, good.
- Like that?

207
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,168
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

208
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,763
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

209
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,743
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

210
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,705
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

211
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,680
You do have a speed bag.

212
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:27,324
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

213
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,092
All right, you go on home now.

214
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:32,135
- I'll walk out with you?
- No, I am home.

215
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,500
- Wanna see?
- Yeah.

216
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:44,780
It's nice.

217
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,815
Would it bother you
if I worked a little longer?

218
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:54,349
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

219
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,363
Thank you.

220
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:16,238
If there's magic in boxing...

221
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:20,047
...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...

222
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:25,513
...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.

223
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:41,466
It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.

224
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:53,184
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

225
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,213
Hey, that's it. That's it.

226
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:57,284
Hands up.

227
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:00,287
Jab, jab, jab.

228
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:15,735
Hey, Flip.

229
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,032
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

230
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,804
I think I found somebody you can beat.

231
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,047
I don't fights women.

232
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,550
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

233
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,350
Because she...
Like, you, you could fight to him...

234
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,186
...and then you could kiss to him.

235
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,021
Then you fight to him one more time.

236
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,920
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

237
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,529
- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.

238
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:44,261
- Thanks, bro.
- That's a girl, man?

239
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:48,872
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

240
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,703
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

241
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,504
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

242
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,580
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

243
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:06,350
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

244
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,400
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

245
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:22,832
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

246
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,001
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

247
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,873
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

248
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,481
Some titties right there, man.

249
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:36,518
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

250
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,213
Punk.

251
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,325
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

252
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,824
- I'll give you a rubdown.
- Oh, I can't, Frankie.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,026
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

254
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:54,331
- Something wrong with Gracie's car?
- She hates that car.

255
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,806
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

256
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,638
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

257
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,507
I'd appreciate that.

258
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,013
Okay.

259
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,947
- Thanks.
- See you later.

260
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,162
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

261
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:21,128
You ever do any work around here?

262
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,595
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

263
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:29,936
Little girl seems to be coming along.

264
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:35,074
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

265
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:40,048
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

266
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:45,316
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

267
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,252
I wonder how the hell she got that.

268
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,951
I wonder.

269
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,963
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

270
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,666
- This bag?
- Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

271
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:07,677
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

272
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,405
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

273
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,550
Yes. Yes, it is.

274
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,914
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

275
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,386
- I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
- Yeah.

276
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,189
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

277
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,726
I understand.

278
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:25,988
Yeah.

279
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,764
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

280
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,897
- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.

281
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,998
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

282
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,235
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

283
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,606
It's the latest freak show out there.

284
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,181
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

285
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,011
...because you're too old.

286
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,677
I don't feel that old.

287
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:52,381
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

288
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:56,059
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

289
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,324
How old are you?

290
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:02,363
- Thirty-one until my next birthday.
- Oh, well, there you go.

291
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,059
Thirty-one.

292
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:07,934
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

293
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,041
Already been working it
for three years.

294
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:13,901
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

295
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:15,907
Never had any, boss.

296
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:19,347
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

297
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:21,611
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

298
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,784
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

299
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,547
Yeah.

300
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,851
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

301
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,768
- You're not gonna cry now, are you?
- No, sir.

302
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:38,895
Yeah.

303
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,563
Here.

304
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:46,134
- Keep the goddamn thing.
- No, you need it.

305
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:48,109
No, take the bag.

306
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,448
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

307
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:56,020
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

308
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,816
- I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
- Yeah.

309
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,421
Just don't lose it.

310
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,559
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

311
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,535
...your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

312
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:17,369
...but if I don't see 40 percent...

313
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:22,112
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

314
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,917
- Hey, Willie.
- Hey, Frankie.

315
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:35,685
Something wrong?

316
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:39,729
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

317
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:43,266
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

318
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,302
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

319
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,303
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

320
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:52,672
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

321
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,676
Gracie cried when she saw it.

322
00:23:54,914 --> 00:23:56,541
Really?

323
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,644
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

324
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:03,845
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

325
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,854
Everything but the split.

326
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:07,889
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

327
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,390
What?

328
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:18,097
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

329
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,502
It ain't that, it's...
It's like you said, I got one shot.

330
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:25,599
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

331
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:29,541
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

332
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:33,349
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

333
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,920
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

334
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,981
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

335
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,388
Only way he'd do it.

336
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:47,095
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

337
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:48,789
I wish it could've been with me.

338
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:54,595
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

339
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:57,604
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

340
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:09,153
There's some things people
just don 't want to hear.

341
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:24,765
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

342
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:29,237
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

343
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:32,104
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

344
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:36,279
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

345
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,985
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

346
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:48,827
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

347
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:54,256
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

348
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:05,506
No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.

349
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:14,844
I heard about Willie.

350
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:18,188
That's cold. That's dead cold.

351
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:21,383
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

352
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,461
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

353
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:27,132
Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

354
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,365
Well, I've got the gym.

355
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:33,937
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

356
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:36,598
Willie tell you why?

357
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,676
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

358
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:43,178
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

359
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,044
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

360
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:48,186
How's that for not believing in him?

361
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:51,754
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

362
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:54,017
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

363
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:57,458
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

364
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:00,530
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

365
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:02,030
Not protect him?

366
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:04,601
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

367
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,262
- Yeah.
- Well, now it makes sense.

368
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,001
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

369
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,407
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

370
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,880
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

371
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,508
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

372
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,817
I had my shot.

373
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:26,583
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

374
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:27,986
Yeah, well, I remember.

375
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,926
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

376
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:35,294
...cleaning up other people's spit.
- Yeah, right.

377
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:39,595
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

378
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:41,800
It's Gaelic.

379
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:45,102
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

380
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:48,075
How do you say that in Gaelic?

381
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:57,615
Sorry.

382
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:06,223
Thanks.

383
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:10,621
The action continues as the champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...

384
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,787
...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.

385
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:15,627
Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left...

386
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,302
Boxing is an unnatural act.

387
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:22,805
Because everything in it is backwards.

388
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,708
You wanna move to the left...

389
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:30,245
...you don 't step left,
you push on the right toe.

390
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:34,910
To move right, you use your left toe.

391
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:39,023
Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...

392
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:40,658
...you step into it.

393
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:46,158
But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,
he hits the champ with a right hand.

394
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:48,765
And the champ is down.

395
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:51,232
Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.

396
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,770
And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.

397
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,569
It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...

398
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:02,077
...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.

399
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,743
Everything in boxing is backwards.

400
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,695
Want a cheeseburger?

401
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,666
- You bought me a cheeseburger?
- Yeah.

402
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,862
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

403
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,066
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

404
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:34,337
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

405
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:39,481
- You watch the fight?
- Yeah, I watched it.

406
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:41,911
Willie did good.

407
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,648
That's what you've got to say?

408
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:47,417
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

409
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:52,830
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

410
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:54,727
You watch it?

411
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,093
Yeah, I got HBO.

412
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,402
Now, how can you afford HBO?

413
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:04,406
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

414
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:07,101
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

415
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,440
...at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

416
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:12,340
- That true?
- Yeah.

417
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:16,180
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

418
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:17,652
Don't you remember nothing?

419
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:22,283
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

420
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:26,363
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

421
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,989
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

422
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:32,659
I had to walk back two miles.

423
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:36,001
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

424
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,335
What the hell's that?

425
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,874
It's her birthday.

426
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:09,229
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

427
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:12,235
So it's your birthday, huh?

428
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:14,641
How old does that make you?

429
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,673
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

430
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:21,444
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

431
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,588
...which is what I been doing since 13.

432
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:28,783
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

433
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,690
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

434
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:34,058
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

435
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:36,359
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

436
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:40,130
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

437
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,865
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

438
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:46,339
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

439
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:50,914
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

440
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,875
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

441
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,055
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

442
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,719
That enough truth to suit you?

443
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:04,191
This your speed bag?

444
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:07,354
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

445
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,864
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

446
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,166
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

447
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:17,968
No, sorry.

448
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:20,611
- You're in a position to negotiate?
- Yes, sir.

449
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,772
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

450
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:28,045
I seen you looking at me.

451
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,155
- Yeah, out of pity.
- Don't you say that.

452
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,190
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

453
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:36,088
I want a trainer.

454
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:40,161
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

455
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:47,633
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

456
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:52,101
Stop, stop, stop.

457
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:56,304
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,679
Okay.

459
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:03,420
If I'm gonna take you on...

460
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:07,080
- You won't never regret it.
- Look, just listen to me.

461
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:10,092
- Lf I take you on...
- I promise I'll work so hard.

462
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:12,662
God, this is a mistake already.

463
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,260
I'm listening, boss.

464
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:21,662
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

465
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,871
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

466
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:29,145
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

467
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:30,542
That's all I ask.

468
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:33,206
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

469
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:35,977
- Alrighty.
- We got a deal.

470
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:38,321
No, not quite.

471
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,458
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

472
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,321
...then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

473
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:47,090
- I hate to argue with you, but...
- Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

474
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:51,031
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

475
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:54,137
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

476
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:57,503
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

477
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,234
It's the only way I'll do it.

478
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,645
All right.

479
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:14,748
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

480
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:18,225
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

481
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:20,557
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

482
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:23,565
So here's what you do.

483
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:26,202
You get yourself...
Bend your knees a little bit.

484
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:30,266
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

485
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:35,512
- Move them how, boss?
- Just... Go... Hit the bag.

486
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:39,179
- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?

487
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:41,512
Okay, you did two things wrong.

488
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:45,019
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

489
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:49,357
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

490
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:53,463
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

491
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:55,259
You can count with me if you want.

492
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:58,266
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

493
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:00,427
- Can you show me that again?
- I just...

494
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:02,630
Just say "one," please.

495
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:04,297
- One.
- Okay.

496
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,307
- One. Okay.
- One.

497
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:09,606
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

498
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:14,445
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

499
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:19,823
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

500
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:25,361
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

501
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,090
And ice pick maneuver again.

502
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:31,326
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

503
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:35,634
Don't watch anything but my feet.

504
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:50,577
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

505
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:24,519
You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.

506
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,594
To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.

507
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,258
Rest when you're dead.

508
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,097
Come here.

509
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:47,271
You can 't just tell them
to forget everything you know...

510
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,505
...you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.

511
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,851
Make them so tired
they only listen to you.

512
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:01,082
Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.

513
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:02,487
Move your feet.

514
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,651
Move your feet around. Let' s see you go.

515
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,902
Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.

516
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:26,812
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

517
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,919
How to generate momentum
off your right toe.

518
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:38,425
And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.

519
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:48,968
How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn 't wanna come after you.

520
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,771
Then you gotta show them
all over again.

521
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,138
Over and over and over...

522
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:57,281
...till they think they were born that way.

523
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,312
Shift.

524
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:02,385
Shift away.

525
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:06,584
Okay. That' s enough for today.

526
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:10,194
Good work. Good girl.

527
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:14,158
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

528
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:40,124
Hey. Hey, come here.

529
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:44,155
You're not breathing.

530
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:47,526
Hate to disagree with you.

531
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,965
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

532
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:54,571
- Now, stop doing that.
- Okay.

533
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:57,037
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

534
00:39:57,575 --> 00:40:01,102
- I mean, for a girl.
- I don't train girls.

535
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:06,076
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

536
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:09,778
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

537
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:12,980
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

538
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:22,629
- Got any family, boss?
- What?

539
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:28,569
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

540
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,802
No.

541
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,842
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

542
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:36,875
That's family.

543
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:39,742
We're not exactly close.

544
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,651
How much she weigh?

545
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:44,218
What?

546
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:47,586
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

547
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:51,555
Yeah.

548
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,922
Not very big.

549
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:58,191
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

550
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:07,767
So, what do you think?

551
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:09,846
I ready for a fight?

552
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:17,417
Hey, Sally.

553
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,547
Come here for a minute, will you?

554
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,258
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

555
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:29,264
- Can I see you a minute?
- Sally here's a real good manager.

556
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:33,393
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

557
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:35,539
I'm looking for a good one.

558
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:38,875
Well, see, there you go.

559
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,409
Nice working with you, girlie.

560
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:49,649
- What'd you want?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

561
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:53,951
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work.
You got a hell of a left.

562
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,724
Thank you.

563
00:41:57,662 --> 00:42:01,325
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

564
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,664
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

565
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:09,329
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

566
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:23,042
Break.

567
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:27,415
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

568
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:30,288
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

569
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:33,760
- I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
- You're wearing her down.

570
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:37,264
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

571
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,863
- Come on.
- Do it.

572
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:43,564
Come on, let's do this!

573
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:49,009
That's it!

574
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,053
Nice night, eh?

575
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:01,152
Jesus Christ.

576
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:03,190
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

577
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:05,153
Hell of a fighter.

578
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:07,388
11-0.

579
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:09,533
Your left. Keep your left up.

580
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:16,398
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

581
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:19,702
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

582
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:21,367
Yeah.

583
00:43:21,746 --> 00:43:23,577
Your left, damn it.

584
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:29,146
Wouldn't have been my choice for
her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

585
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,050
- He must think she can take her.
- Jesus H.

586
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,851
Your left. Keep your left up.

587
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:38,285
You think she can hear you
from back here?

588
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:49,102
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

589
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:51,264
Might even help him.

590
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:53,342
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

591
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:58,073
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

592
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:00,681
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

593
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:02,285
Hey, what do I know?

594
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:05,183
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

595
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,916
Mother of God.

596
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,283
Okay, break.

597
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:12,827
Hey. Come here, come here.

598
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:14,396
Hey. Get over here.

599
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,398
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

600
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:20,298
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

601
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,872
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

602
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,967
Dunn.

603
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:28,635
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking. What are you doing?

604
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:30,713
- Is this your fighter?
- It's my fighter.

605
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:34,279
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

606
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:37,580
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

607
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:42,158
- Somebody tell me what's going on.
- I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

608
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:44,760
You telling me this is your fighter?

609
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:49,330
Yeah, this is my fighter.

610
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,195
Then you got 10 seconds.

611
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:54,666
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

612
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,898
- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

613
00:44:57,074 --> 00:44:58,234
She thinks she knows you.

614
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,435
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

615
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,843
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

616
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:08,008
- When she cocks that right hand... You hear?
- I hear you, boss.

617
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:11,178
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

618
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:12,686
- Got one?
- Got it right here.

619
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:15,619
- Okay.
- Fight, or I'm calling it.

620
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:18,785
- Go give it to her.
- The body knows what fighters don 't.

621
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,191
How to protect itself.

622
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:23,163
A neck can only twist so far.

623
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:26,531
Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:

624
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,868
"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don 't know what you're doing."

625
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,873
Neutral corner.

626
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,210
- See the way she did that?
- Yeah.

627
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,349
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl ' s got sugar.

628
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:45,149
"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses."

629
00:45:45,323 --> 00:45:47,553
It's called the knockout mechanism.

630
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:51,422
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

631
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:53,530
Thanks, boss.

632
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:56,263
You... You forgot the rule.

633
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,868
- Now, what is the rule?
- Keep my left up?

634
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:02,005
It's to protect yourself at all times.

635
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:04,131
Now, what is the rule?

636
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:07,641
- Protect myself at all times.
- Good, good.

637
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:10,042
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

638
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:12,877
It wasn't.

639
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,509
It's okay.

640
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:20,054
- I'll work on my left, boss.
- Drink your water.

641
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:22,853
Other than that, how'd I do?

642
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:26,161
Fine. You did fine.

643
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,655
You gonna leave me again?

644
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:32,496
Never.

645
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,039
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

646
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:40,203
- Sure.
- Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

647
00:46:40,378 --> 00:46:44,075
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

648
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,576
- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.

649
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:54,450
- You gonna argue with me?
- Know better than to do that, boss.

650
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,856
Well, good.

651
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:59,690
All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.

652
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:03,565
Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.

653
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:08,000
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

654
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:13,475
Truth is, even if they're wrong...

655
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,636
...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...

656
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:21,649
...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain 't fighters at all.

657
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:25,084
- Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
- You sure did, boss.

658
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:26,985
That was last night.

659
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:29,956
You said not to argue with you.

660
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:44,068
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

661
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:46,209
You want my advice?

662
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:47,844
What?

663
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:50,269
Where are your shoes?

664
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:53,640
I'm airing out my feet.

665
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:57,251
You got big holes in your socks.

666
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,280
Oh, they're not that big.

667
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:04,323
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

668
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:07,658
These are my sleeping socks.

669
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:11,695
My feet like a little air at night.

670
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,533
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

671
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:17,697
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

672
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:25,540
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

673
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:27,510
Please?

674
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:33,721
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

675
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:35,825
Might find its way to the track.

676
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,574
It's over. It's over.

677
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:13,090
Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.

678
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:25,975
I got the breathing thing down.

679
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:29,704
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

680
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,407
- Thought that was the point.
- The point is to get good.

681
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:36,645
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

682
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:39,016
How am I gonna get you fights?

683
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:43,123
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

684
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,922
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

685
00:49:46,464 --> 00:49:48,694
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

686
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:52,063
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

687
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:59,237
Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...

688
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,605
...just to let her know who was boss.

689
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:08,641
Three, four, five...

690
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,946
...six, seven...

691
00:50:11,155 --> 00:50:12,713
Sorry, boss.

692
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,949
Maggie left no doubt about it.

693
00:50:23,868 --> 00:50:27,099
All right, let's do it.

694
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,232
Her first six-rounder
didn 't go quite as smooth.

695
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:48,822
Get up!

696
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,657
To your corner.

697
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:53,991
- Three, four, five...
- Get up.

698
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:56,394
...six, seven...
- Get up.

699
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:59,627
...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
- You can do this.

700
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:05,342
Maggie didn 't knock her out
till the end of the first round.

701
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:09,673
After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.

702
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:16,777
Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...

703
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:20,981
...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.

704
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:35,471
That only worked for so long.

705
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:38,767
Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.

706
00:51:38,943 --> 00:51:40,001
He took a chance.

707
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:44,509
Box.

708
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:51,343
He moved her up in class.

709
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:54,389
That could've been a mistake.

710
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:08,670
Watch the right!

711
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,236
Watch it. Watch it.

712
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,018
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

713
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:35,064
Damn, damn, damn.

714
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:39,001
Give us two seconds, will you?

715
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:40,898
- Okay.
- Just two seconds.

716
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:43,935
- Your nose is broke.
- Oh, damn.

717
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:45,871
- Fix it.
- I can't, I can't.

718
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:48,568
- You can fix it.
- I can't. I've gotta call it.

719
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:50,646
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

720
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:53,848
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

721
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:55,542
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

722
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:58,984
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

723
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,324
Bite down on this.

724
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,978
- Inhale.
- What?

725
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:23,579
- Inhale.
- What?

726
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:25,709
Breathe in.

727
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,690
- Okay, huh?
- Yeah, it's okay.

728
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,024
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

729
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,327
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

730
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,697
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

731
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:49,600
Now get going.

732
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,183
Go to your corner.

733
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:08,119
Three, four, five...

734
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:11,989
- Come on, breathe. Breathe.
...six, seven, eight...

735
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:14,255
...nine, ten.

736
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:19,158
Mo cuishle.

737
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:26,437
- All right!
- Yeah!

738
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:29,711
Right.

739
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:35,680
What you reading?

740
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,848
What's she saying?

741
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:40,719
Wants to know what you're reading.

742
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:43,824
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

743
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:46,696
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

744
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:49,492
Show her what a treat that is.

745
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,035
When the hell they gonna get to her?

746
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:54,466
I'm okay, Frankie.

747
00:54:55,205 --> 00:54:58,174
- What'd you learn tonight?
- Always protect myself.

748
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:01,436
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

749
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:03,477
- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here.

750
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,986
I'll be right here.

751
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:24,400
- How you doing?
- Me?

752
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:26,536
- Yeah, you.
- I'm not the one who's hurt.

753
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,205
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

754
00:55:33,977 --> 00:55:36,241
Why are you telling me that?

755
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:39,779
No reason.

756
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,148
But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.

757
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:48,982
And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can 't stop the bleeding.

758
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:52,526
- Did you write your daughter?
- Every week.

759
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:57,056
I've no idea why you come to church.

760
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:32,964
After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.

761
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:38,133
The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...

762
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,674
...for the WBA welterweight title.

763
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:44,410
Billie "The Blue Bear."

764
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,709
Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.

765
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:52,083
Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

766
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:11,940
Didn 't seem to matter to her...

767
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,737
...that something like that
could kill a person.

768
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:17,841
And the crowds loved her.

769
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:23,753
He turned it down
without even telling her.

770
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,185
The next was to fight
the British champ...

771
00:57:26,356 --> 00:57:29,655
...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.
- Hello?

772
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,451
Not interested.

773
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:37,859
He turned that down too.

774
00:57:40,037 --> 00:57:42,335
That' s a lot of money, boss.

775
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:45,964
Yeah, you ' re making money.
What are you still working here for?

776
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,838
It's a title match, right?

777
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:51,003
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

778
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:54,514
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

779
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:57,879
Might still be a good fight.

780
00:57:58,055 --> 00:58:01,582
Yeah, I just... I just brought you up
to welterweight.

781
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:05,216
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

782
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:08,364
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

783
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,362
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

784
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,371
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

785
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,065
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

786
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:25,973
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

787
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:57,811
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

788
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:00,646
I made us a reservation.

789
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:04,453
You might wanna shower.

790
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:27,968
Here you go.

791
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:30,007
Here you go.

792
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:32,206
What's this?

793
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,679
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

794
00:59:36,217 --> 00:59:37,684
Go on and blow.

795
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,319
Thank you.

796
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:50,920
Thirty-three ain't so old.

797
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:54,499
I was still fighting at 39.

798
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:58,328
Fought for 23 years.

799
01:00:02,076 --> 01:00:03,737
How's it going, Scrap?

800
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:05,572
Doing good, Mickey.

801
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:08,444
Doing good.

802
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:12,376
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

803
01:00:17,892 --> 01:00:20,156
You two not speaking?

804
01:00:20,595 --> 01:00:22,825
Don't hardly know him.

805
01:00:27,768 --> 01:00:31,966
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

806
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:35,567
He was picking up cut work.

807
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:40,241
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

808
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:43,573
Good man to have in your corner.

809
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,453
Yes, he is.

810
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:51,219
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

811
01:00:52,026 --> 01:00:55,462
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

812
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,488
...and it was just Frankie and me.

813
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:04,202
I was taking a hellacious beating.

814
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,973
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

815
01:01:09,677 --> 01:01:12,612
Nobody tells you what that number is.

816
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:16,210
Mine was 109.

817
01:01:16,817 --> 01:01:19,081
I just didn't want to admit it.

818
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:23,187
Fourth round, this...

819
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:25,324
...cut opens up.

820
01:01:25,793 --> 01:01:28,591
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

821
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:34,457
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

822
01:01:34,669 --> 01:01:36,830
Blood was what I was there for.

823
01:01:37,705 --> 01:01:41,266
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

824
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:43,833
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

825
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:47,344
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

826
01:01:48,382 --> 01:01:50,646
Round after round...

827
01:01:50,818 --> 01:01:53,150
...he's arguing with me.

828
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:58,618
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

829
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:02,018
I go 15 rounds...

830
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:04,426
...Iose by decision.

831
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,465
Next morning, I lose the eye.

832
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:13,498
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

833
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:18,503
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

834
01:02:19,347 --> 01:02:21,144
Somehow...

835
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:24,812
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

836
01:02:25,653 --> 01:02:27,985
...should've saved my eye.

837
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:34,320
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

838
01:02:35,162 --> 01:02:38,097
I wanted to go to 110.

839
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:40,690
Thing is...

840
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:43,166
...if you wanna get to the title...

841
01:02:44,472 --> 01:02:47,168
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

842
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,507
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

843
01:02:57,685 --> 01:02:59,915
You go on, eat your cupcake.

844
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:02,817
No, I got it.

845
01:03:08,362 --> 01:03:09,761
It's the rule.

846
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,330
Always protect yourself.

847
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,733
People never take their own advice.

848
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:20,931
If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.

849
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:27,247
Mr. Mickey Mack?

850
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:29,747
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

851
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:35,785
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

852
01:03:36,223 --> 01:03:39,283
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

853
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:43,219
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

854
01:03:45,266 --> 01:03:47,666
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

855
01:03:51,405 --> 01:03:55,569
Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.

856
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:32,611
The letters always came back
marked the same way:

857
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,975
"Return to sender."

858
01:05:04,512 --> 01:05:07,037
I ' II make you some coffee.

859
01:05:09,016 --> 01:05:10,677
What are you doing with your money?

860
01:05:11,285 --> 01:05:13,378
- Saving it.
- Good girl.

861
01:05:15,222 --> 01:05:18,623
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

862
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:20,124
Cash, no mortgage.

863
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:22,854
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

864
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:29,197
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

865
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,998
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

866
01:05:32,173 --> 01:05:35,404
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

867
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,277
You understand?

868
01:05:37,545 --> 01:05:41,345
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

869
01:05:41,515 --> 01:05:43,506
Okay, soon as I get the money.

870
01:05:43,684 --> 01:05:47,745
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just
trying to keep you from doing the same.

871
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:49,849
I know, boss.

872
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:53,626
- I'm not gonna live forever.
- What is it?

873
01:05:53,794 --> 01:05:56,456
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

874
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:59,961
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to... Hey.

875
01:06:00,134 --> 01:06:02,796
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

876
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:05,598
- Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

877
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:10,210
You're welcome, darling. Here, just...
Here, let me put this in the machine.

878
01:06:10,377 --> 01:06:12,402
What machine?

879
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:14,571
Don't have a TV, huh?

880
01:06:14,748 --> 01:06:16,511
No.

881
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:18,947
Yeah!

882
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:22,149
All right. Okay.

883
01:06:28,229 --> 01:06:30,720
- Ten minutes, love.
- Thank you.

884
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:32,464
Man says he loves me.

885
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:34,726
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

886
01:06:34,902 --> 01:06:37,132
First since my daddy.

887
01:06:37,771 --> 01:06:39,432
I win, you think he'll propose?

888
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:41,934
You win, I'll propose.

889
01:06:45,746 --> 01:06:47,680
Look, I got you a gift here.

890
01:06:52,887 --> 01:06:54,718
I think they gave you somebody else's.

891
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:56,857
No, no, this is it.

892
01:06:57,892 --> 01:06:59,359
What's it mean?

893
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:03,361
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

894
01:07:04,298 --> 01:07:07,995
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, I thought so.

895
01:07:08,168 --> 01:07:09,999
- Yeah.
- Real silk thread.

896
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:17,941
From the United States
of America, the challenger...

897
01:07:18,112 --> 01:07:21,445
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

898
01:07:23,217 --> 01:07:25,310
Mo cuishle.
Did you see what was on her robe?

899
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:27,750
- Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
- Mo cuishle.

900
01:07:31,959 --> 01:07:33,824
She wasn 't the main attraction.

901
01:07:33,994 --> 01:07:37,657
She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.

902
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:40,023
But ask someone who was there...

903
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,192
...they couldn 't tell you who else
fought that night.

904
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:51,004
Box.

905
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:13,055
- Come on!
- Mo cuishle!

906
01:08:13,767 --> 01:08:17,931
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

907
01:08:19,139 --> 01:08:20,766
Mo cuishle!

908
01:08:22,076 --> 01:08:23,168
Mo cuishle!

909
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:28,037
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

910
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:38,553
She's tough.

911
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,694
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

912
01:08:42,863 --> 01:08:45,331
- You know why that is?
- Why?

913
01:08:45,766 --> 01:08:47,700
She's a better fighter than you are.

914
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:51,964
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

915
01:08:52,139 --> 01:08:54,334
...what are you gonna do about it?

916
01:09:02,383 --> 01:09:04,146
Get in there.

917
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:06,443
Box.

918
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,867
Three, four, five, six...

919
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:30,204
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

920
01:09:30,911 --> 01:09:34,472
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

921
01:09:41,622 --> 01:09:44,955
- Mo cuishle!
- Mo cuishle!

922
01:09:52,132 --> 01:09:54,293
I could ask someone, you know?

923
01:09:54,868 --> 01:09:56,199
Good.

924
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,395
You find out, you let me know.

925
01:10:05,646 --> 01:10:08,410
Whatever it meant, the name stuck.

926
01:10:08,582 --> 01:10:13,144
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.

927
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,153
It was always mo cuishle.

928
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,722
Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...

929
01:10:18,892 --> 01:10:21,224
...or people who wanna be.

930
01:10:21,628 --> 01:10:24,119
By the time they came back
to the States...

931
01:10:24,965 --> 01:10:28,059
...Maggie was in a whole new league.

932
01:10:45,185 --> 01:10:49,645
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

933
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,663
After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.

934
01:11:05,038 --> 01:11:06,903
What's the split?

935
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:09,908
- Sixty-forty.
- Good.

936
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:14,036
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

937
01:11:14,548 --> 01:11:15,947
That little girl?

938
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:19,683
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

939
01:11:19,853 --> 01:11:23,653
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

940
01:11:23,824 --> 01:11:26,884
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

941
01:11:34,434 --> 01:11:36,129
There you go.

942
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,839
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

943
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,339
How's that girl doing?

944
01:11:45,512 --> 01:11:48,640
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

945
01:11:48,816 --> 01:11:50,750
She be all right?

946
01:11:51,018 --> 01:11:54,818
- And if she isn't?
- Maybe I should send her something.

947
01:11:54,988 --> 01:11:59,152
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

948
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:05,927
Boss?

949
01:12:06,099 --> 01:12:07,964
That little house we talked about?

950
01:12:08,602 --> 01:12:09,796
I bought it.

951
01:12:10,504 --> 01:12:12,836
Well, smart girl.

952
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:17,307
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

953
01:12:17,477 --> 01:12:19,604
No mortgage, just like you said.

954
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:23,942
You're a good daughter.

955
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:26,678
She don't know about it yet.

956
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:30,381
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

957
01:12:30,557 --> 01:12:32,491
I know she wants to meet you.

958
01:12:35,162 --> 01:12:37,687
Yeah, we could do that.

959
01:12:54,748 --> 01:12:57,911
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

960
01:12:58,085 --> 01:13:00,280
Mary M.'s here.

961
01:13:17,337 --> 01:13:21,398
- This is the Johnsons' old house.
- Not anymore.

962
01:13:25,112 --> 01:13:28,946
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

963
01:13:29,116 --> 01:13:32,916
- Mary M., you bought this for me?
- Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

964
01:13:33,086 --> 01:13:34,781
Darling...

965
01:13:35,022 --> 01:13:37,286
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

966
01:13:37,457 --> 01:13:39,755
They'll be here before you move in.

967
01:13:40,994 --> 01:13:43,394
- How much money did this cost you?
- Never mind that.

968
01:13:43,563 --> 01:13:46,259
- You shouldn't have done this.
- You need a decent place.

969
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:49,732
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

970
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:54,335
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

971
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:58,342
- Mama, no, they ain't.
- They are. You're fine, you're working...

972
01:13:58,512 --> 01:14:00,377
...but I can't live without my welfare.

973
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:02,208
Mama, I'll send you money.

974
01:14:02,482 --> 01:14:05,781
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

975
01:14:05,953 --> 01:14:09,582
- How am I supposed to get my medicine?
- I'll send you more money.

976
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:12,187
I hope you don't expect J.D.
To move in with us.

977
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:13,621
He's getting out, you know.

978
01:14:14,394 --> 01:14:16,828
Why didn't you just give me the money?

979
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:20,459
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

980
01:14:21,601 --> 01:14:26,197
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

981
01:14:26,373 --> 01:14:28,534
You want the money, sell it.

982
01:14:35,082 --> 01:14:36,709
I don't...

983
01:14:43,256 --> 01:14:45,156
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

984
01:14:45,325 --> 01:14:47,725
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

985
01:14:47,894 --> 01:14:51,421
- That's true, Mama.
- I'll try and keep the house.

986
01:14:51,932 --> 01:14:54,264
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

987
01:14:54,434 --> 01:14:56,334
I'll send you some more money.

988
01:15:05,512 --> 01:15:07,742
That man hitting you?

989
01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:11,443
It's from the fight.

990
01:15:11,818 --> 01:15:13,376
I'm a fighter, Mama.

991
01:15:14,254 --> 01:15:16,222
Find a man, Mary M.

992
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:18,051
Live proper.

993
01:15:18,225 --> 01:15:21,217
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

994
01:15:21,395 --> 01:15:24,455
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

995
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:17,946
Hi.

996
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:50,376
You ever own a dog?

997
01:16:50,547 --> 01:16:52,071
Nope.

998
01:16:52,248 --> 01:16:56,844
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

999
01:16:58,888 --> 01:17:03,257
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1000
01:17:03,426 --> 01:17:05,121
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1001
01:17:05,295 --> 01:17:08,890
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

1002
01:17:09,065 --> 01:17:12,034
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1003
01:17:12,202 --> 01:17:16,036
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1004
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:20,305
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1005
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:25,239
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1006
01:17:25,415 --> 01:17:29,818
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1007
01:17:30,587 --> 01:17:34,045
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1008
01:17:34,224 --> 01:17:36,852
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1009
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:44,595
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1010
01:17:53,576 --> 01:17:56,067
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1011
01:17:59,349 --> 01:18:01,214
Well, you've got me.

1012
01:18:03,686 --> 01:18:07,850
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1013
01:18:15,832 --> 01:18:19,768
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1014
01:18:20,103 --> 01:18:21,832
Yeah.

1015
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:25,307
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1016
01:18:25,475 --> 01:18:28,410
None of that canned-filling crap.

1017
01:18:42,992 --> 01:18:45,654
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1018
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:52,501
I used to come here with Daddy.

1019
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:56,195
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1020
01:18:56,372 --> 01:18:58,897
I got a little bit of savings.

1021
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,474
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1022
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:15,282
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1023
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:18,356
Looks like another bottle of water.

1024
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:20,860
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1025
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:25,998
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1026
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:29,764
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1027
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:31,964
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1028
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,939
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1029
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,702
Well, I could use a good second.

1030
01:19:35,879 --> 01:19:37,642
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1031
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:39,907
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1032
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:44,511
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1033
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:48,418
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1034
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:50,582
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1035
01:19:51,761 --> 01:19:54,229
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1036
01:19:55,765 --> 01:19:57,460
Somebody with young hands.

1037
01:19:57,634 --> 01:20:00,694
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1038
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:04,370
I leave this place for one day...

1039
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:07,374
...got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1040
01:20:07,544 --> 01:20:09,375
Kind of like it looks right now.

1041
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:10,979
Oh, go to hell.

1042
01:20:12,782 --> 01:20:15,876
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1043
01:20:16,286 --> 01:20:17,844
Will do.

1044
01:20:21,925 --> 01:20:23,893
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1045
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,359
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1046
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,760
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1047
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:31,730
Okay.

1048
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:38,064
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1049
01:20:38,241 --> 01:20:40,300
I've been thinking on it.

1050
01:20:40,476 --> 01:20:42,239
Can't figure it out.

1051
01:20:42,412 --> 01:20:44,039
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1052
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,581
- You could do that? You could show me?
- I think so. I think so.

1053
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:52,778
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1054
01:20:56,593 --> 01:20:59,084
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1055
01:20:59,262 --> 01:21:02,163
- We're flying?
- Would you rather drive?

1056
01:21:03,533 --> 01:21:05,262
You're asking me?

1057
01:21:05,868 --> 01:21:08,666
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1058
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:11,603
So I finally get to decide something?

1059
01:21:11,774 --> 01:21:13,173
That's what I'm saying.

1060
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,938
Fine.

1061
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:16,840
Fly there, drive back.

1062
01:21:17,313 --> 01:21:20,874
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1063
01:21:21,184 --> 01:21:22,811
You said it was up to me.

1064
01:21:32,962 --> 01:21:35,226
Give them hell there, Danger.

1065
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:38,424
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1066
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:45,570
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1067
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:49,306
Jesus.

1068
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:52,172
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1069
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:54,776
Oh, God!

1070
01:21:59,188 --> 01:22:00,485
Dumb-ass.

1071
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,324
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1072
01:22:03,493 --> 01:22:04,892
Come on. Defense!

1073
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:07,825
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1074
01:22:08,598 --> 01:22:10,532
...drinking mai tais...

1075
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,891
...Iooking at naked women.

1076
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:16,334
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1077
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:20,973
Danger, get out of there!

1078
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,183
Fight back! Come on!

1079
01:22:30,353 --> 01:22:32,981
- There you go, Danger, there you go!
- Good job, man.

1080
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,180
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

1081
01:22:35,358 --> 01:22:36,586
Come on.

1082
01:22:45,768 --> 01:22:47,235
Hey, come on now, Flip.

1083
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:49,530
- What you doing? Let him go.
- All right. Okay.

1084
01:22:49,706 --> 01:22:52,072
I got you. Come on, come on.

1085
01:22:53,643 --> 01:22:55,201
It's all right.

1086
01:22:56,746 --> 01:22:58,213
We don't need no corner trainer.

1087
01:22:58,381 --> 01:22:59,746
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1088
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:01,816
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1089
01:23:01,984 --> 01:23:04,111
You my man. You rock.

1090
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:06,221
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

1091
01:23:06,389 --> 01:23:09,153
You ain't even fight good yet.

1092
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:11,259
Anybody can lose one fight.

1093
01:23:11,427 --> 01:23:13,895
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

1094
01:23:14,063 --> 01:23:15,724
You'll be champion of the world.

1095
01:23:15,898 --> 01:23:18,162
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1096
01:23:19,135 --> 01:23:20,830
I should have knowed.

1097
01:23:21,003 --> 01:23:23,563
- Come on. We don't need to be talking.
- Let me help you.

1098
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,267
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1099
01:23:28,244 --> 01:23:29,336
All right.

1100
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:34,272
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1101
01:23:35,718 --> 01:23:38,448
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1102
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:41,421
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1103
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:43,716
Come on, now.

1104
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:47,852
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1105
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:52,026
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1106
01:23:59,809 --> 01:24:02,937
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1107
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,342
Keep going, man.

1108
01:24:05,515 --> 01:24:07,244
All right, man.

1109
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,080
He ain't so tough.

1110
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,360
One hundred and ten.

1111
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,927
Get a job, punk.

1112
01:24:56,432 --> 01:24:59,367
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1113
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:02,428
I got you some pipers.

1114
01:25:16,085 --> 01:25:19,987
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1115
01:25:20,556 --> 01:25:24,458
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1116
01:25:33,302 --> 01:25:34,735
All right, now!

1117
01:26:24,587 --> 01:26:27,021
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1118
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:29,282
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1119
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:48,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...

1120
01:26:48,978 --> 01:26:51,208
...presentation of the evening.

1121
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:55,942
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1122
01:26:56,352 --> 01:26:58,183
...in the red corner.

1123
01:26:58,354 --> 01:26:59,981
In the blue corner...

1124
01:27:00,156 --> 01:27:04,490
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1125
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,527
...Billie "The Blue Bear."

1126
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,497
Sweet Jesus.

1127
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:31,678
Fitzgerald is pushing The Blue Bear
around the ring. She's coming on strong.

1128
01:27:34,523 --> 01:27:37,583
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1129
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,887
- And a right hook stuns the champ.
- All right.

1130
01:27:41,964 --> 01:27:43,226
Break it up!

1131
01:27:46,202 --> 01:27:48,170
Break it! Break it!

1132
01:27:54,243 --> 01:27:57,076
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1133
01:27:59,248 --> 01:28:00,545
Go fight.

1134
01:28:08,524 --> 01:28:10,355
You motherfucker.

1135
01:28:18,534 --> 01:28:20,968
Come on. What the fuck?

1136
01:28:21,137 --> 01:28:23,867
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1137
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,270
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1138
01:28:27,943 --> 01:28:29,467
- Comes back, hits Fitzgerald...

1139
01:28:29,645 --> 01:28:31,078
Ref, open your eyes, you...

1140
01:28:49,098 --> 01:28:52,829
Ladies and gentlemen, the first round
is in the books on this championship match.

1141
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:58,738
- Hold onto that.
- There you go.

1142
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:05,878
- Looking good.
- You pull that crap one more time...

1143
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,811
...you're disqualified.

1144
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:17,650
It's gonna be all right.

1145
01:29:17,827 --> 01:29:19,556
Got no doubt, boss.

1146
01:29:22,431 --> 01:29:24,991
Okay, just watch yourself.

1147
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,566
Stay away from this dame.

1148
01:29:39,048 --> 01:29:41,744
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1149
01:29:42,718 --> 01:29:46,085
- Four, five, six...
- Stay down, you bitch.

1150
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:49,656
...seven, eight, nine.

1151
01:30:02,638 --> 01:30:04,071
Yeah, yeah!

1152
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:07,231
Break it! Break it!

1153
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:17,984
Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion...

1154
01:30:31,767 --> 01:30:33,462
Yes! Come on!

1155
01:30:33,836 --> 01:30:35,201
I got it! I got it.

1156
01:30:41,944 --> 01:30:43,343
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1157
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:46,276
- How many eyes you need to finish this?
- One's enough.

1158
01:30:49,718 --> 01:30:51,345
- Good.
- Now...

1159
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,044
...what do I do about the Bear?

1160
01:30:53,222 --> 01:30:56,157
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1161
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:59,920
- I been doing that. She's made of steel.
- I don't want you to go to the liver.

1162
01:31:00,095 --> 01:31:03,030
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1163
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:06,259
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1164
01:31:06,435 --> 01:31:08,528
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1165
01:31:08,871 --> 01:31:11,669
- What about the ref?
- Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1166
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,604
...and everything will just be fine.

1167
01:31:15,778 --> 01:31:17,643
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1168
01:31:17,813 --> 01:31:19,371
You keep it up.

1169
01:31:32,962 --> 01:31:34,327
Oh, yeah!

1170
01:31:45,307 --> 01:31:46,968
Break, break!

1171
01:31:53,816 --> 01:31:57,445
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1172
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:28,716
Doctor.

1173
01:32:43,465 --> 01:32:44,727
Come on.

1174
01:32:45,134 --> 01:32:46,624
Breathe.

1175
01:32:46,802 --> 01:32:49,362
That's it. Breathe.

1176
01:32:49,838 --> 01:32:51,465
Good.

1177
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,164
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1178
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,171
Breathe.

1179
01:32:55,878 --> 01:32:57,368
Good.

1180
01:32:57,813 --> 01:32:59,178
That's it.

1181
01:33:00,516 --> 01:33:01,778
Breathe.

1182
01:33:50,265 --> 01:33:52,028
How you feeling, darling?

1183
01:34:00,576 --> 01:34:02,840
Growing a beard, boss?

1184
01:34:03,645 --> 01:34:06,512
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1185
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:10,714
Can't say it does.

1186
01:34:38,113 --> 01:34:40,479
Does it...? Does it hurt much?

1187
01:34:42,351 --> 01:34:44,478
Don't hurt at all.

1188
01:34:46,422 --> 01:34:48,049
Well, that's good.

1189
01:34:53,662 --> 01:34:55,323
Where's Frankie?

1190
01:34:57,433 --> 01:34:58,866
Well, he's...

1191
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:01,434
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1192
01:35:01,603 --> 01:35:04,697
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1193
01:35:06,942 --> 01:35:11,311
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1194
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:19,249
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1195
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:26,486
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1196
01:35:31,467 --> 01:35:35,369
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1197
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,804
Did you see the fight?

1198
01:35:48,383 --> 01:35:50,078
Of course I did.

1199
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,054
You had her cold, Maggie.

1200
01:35:54,656 --> 01:35:57,648
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1201
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,691
I shouldn't have turned.

1202
01:36:10,672 --> 01:36:12,537
Always protect myself.

1203
01:36:12,708 --> 01:36:15,836
How many times he tell me that?

1204
01:36:17,012 --> 01:36:18,445
Yeah...

1205
01:36:19,481 --> 01:36:21,676
...he does like to repeat himself.

1206
01:36:25,454 --> 01:36:28,787
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1207
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:34,295
No.

1208
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:37,261
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1209
01:36:57,419 --> 01:36:58,977
Damnedest thing.

1210
01:37:02,824 --> 01:37:04,587
So, what's the plan?

1211
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:08,759
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1212
01:37:08,931 --> 01:37:10,694
It's your fault.

1213
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,292
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1214
01:37:14,469 --> 01:37:16,437
You kept after me until I trained her.

1215
01:37:16,905 --> 01:37:19,840
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1216
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:23,344
Everything kept telling me not to.

1217
01:37:23,512 --> 01:37:25,275
Everything but you.

1218
01:37:35,724 --> 01:37:37,385
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1219
01:37:37,559 --> 01:37:39,527
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1220
01:37:39,695 --> 01:37:42,664
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

1221
01:37:43,532 --> 01:37:45,796
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1222
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:49,730
...we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1223
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:54,575
You just rest there, I'II...

1224
01:37:56,378 --> 01:37:57,970
I'm on it.

1225
01:38:07,055 --> 01:38:09,455
Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...

1226
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:12,423
...Iooking for somebody
who 'd tell him they could fix her.

1227
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:16,655
He came close twice,
till they checked her over...

1228
01:38:16,999 --> 01:38:18,967
...said there was nothing to be done.

1229
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:22,698
Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.

1230
01:38:27,976 --> 01:38:30,501
They got nurses for that, you know.

1231
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:34,211
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1232
01:38:46,328 --> 01:38:50,662
She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn 't change positions.

1233
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,302
Thank you.

1234
01:39:13,255 --> 01:39:16,622
They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.

1235
01:39:28,003 --> 01:39:30,870
Fly there, drive back.

1236
01:39:37,212 --> 01:39:40,670
The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.

1237
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:42,946
They took good care of Maggie.

1238
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:45,211
She wouldn 't have complained
if they hadn 't.

1239
01:39:46,488 --> 01:39:50,447
Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1240
01:39:55,664 --> 01:39:57,962
One, two, three, up.

1241
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,701
Since she couldn 't breathe on her own...

1242
01:40:02,871 --> 01:40:05,499
...her respirators were always on.

1243
01:40:06,742 --> 01:40:10,576
Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.

1244
01:40:36,738 --> 01:40:40,139
Maggie 's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.

1245
01:40:40,308 --> 01:40:43,937
She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.

1246
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:46,210
Sure.

1247
01:40:46,381 --> 01:40:48,975
Frankie finally tracked them down.

1248
01:40:49,151 --> 01:40:53,144
Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.

1249
01:40:53,321 --> 01:40:56,688
Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.

1250
01:41:00,762 --> 01:41:03,458
You don't have to hang around all day.

1251
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:10,261
I like it here. I don't mind.

1252
01:41:11,006 --> 01:41:14,965
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1253
01:41:17,846 --> 01:41:20,815
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1254
01:41:21,183 --> 01:41:22,980
Well, it's no burden.

1255
01:41:23,919 --> 01:41:25,352
Here.

1256
01:41:27,389 --> 01:41:28,686
Read this.

1257
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:39,926
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1258
01:41:40,402 --> 01:41:41,869
That's terrible.

1259
01:41:44,339 --> 01:41:47,365
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1260
01:41:50,278 --> 01:41:51,745
It says:

1261
01:41:51,913 --> 01:41:55,474
I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree

1262
01:41:55,650 --> 01:42:00,178
And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made

1263
01:42:01,089 --> 01:42:05,492
And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow

1264
01:42:06,094 --> 01:42:10,793
Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.

1265
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:14,567
Not bad, huh?

1266
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,235
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1267
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:23,741
- Me?
- Yeah.

1268
01:42:26,114 --> 01:42:28,844
You know, when you quit all this.

1269
01:42:30,819 --> 01:42:32,446
You mean boxing?

1270
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:35,649
No, I'll never quit.

1271
01:42:36,658 --> 01:42:39,149
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1272
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:47,558
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1273
01:42:47,736 --> 01:42:50,102
...with your books and lemon pie.

1274
01:42:52,274 --> 01:42:55,175
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1275
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:59,476
I could learn how to bake.

1276
01:43:03,418 --> 01:43:04,942
Well, then, I'II...

1277
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,281
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1278
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:30,500
Yeah.

1279
01:43:33,281 --> 01:43:35,681
- Go ahead.
- All right. Okay, sounds good.

1280
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:41,988
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1281
01:43:42,157 --> 01:43:43,454
Where's my little girl?

1282
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:46,458
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1283
01:43:46,628 --> 01:43:49,392
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1284
01:43:49,564 --> 01:43:53,022
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1285
01:43:53,201 --> 01:43:55,965
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

1286
01:43:56,137 --> 01:43:57,536
There's some rides you missed.

1287
01:43:57,706 --> 01:44:00,368
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1288
01:44:00,542 --> 01:44:02,806
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1289
01:44:02,978 --> 01:44:05,139
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1290
01:44:05,313 --> 01:44:06,974
Mary M. Can't go nowhere.

1291
01:44:07,148 --> 01:44:10,117
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1292
01:44:11,653 --> 01:44:12,847
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1293
01:44:13,321 --> 01:44:15,016
Right down here, 301.

1294
01:44:15,323 --> 01:44:17,018
- Come on, Mama.
- Let's go.

1295
01:44:23,531 --> 01:44:25,624
And I saw myself breathing.

1296
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,665
Like, my body was going up and down.

1297
01:44:27,836 --> 01:44:30,669
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1298
01:44:34,142 --> 01:44:37,009
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1299
01:44:51,092 --> 01:44:52,457
It's just a...

1300
01:44:53,461 --> 01:44:55,554
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1301
01:44:55,764 --> 01:44:57,061
What is it?

1302
01:44:57,232 --> 01:44:59,291
How we all doing here?

1303
01:44:59,467 --> 01:45:01,992
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

1304
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:06,334
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1305
01:45:06,508 --> 01:45:09,136
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

1306
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:10,868
Hey, old man...

1307
01:45:11,046 --> 01:45:12,513
...you part of our family?

1308
01:45:13,448 --> 01:45:15,109
Stay the hell out of this.

1309
01:45:16,718 --> 01:45:18,447
Read it to me, Mama.

1310
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:22,181
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

1311
01:45:22,957 --> 01:45:24,481
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1312
01:45:25,326 --> 01:45:28,762
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1313
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:31,257
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1314
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:34,266
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1315
01:45:34,436 --> 01:45:37,599
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1316
01:45:37,772 --> 01:45:39,603
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1317
01:45:40,408 --> 01:45:43,400
- Nothing.
- Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1318
01:45:43,578 --> 01:45:47,446
- Then I'll just read it to her later on...
- With respect, this ain't your business.

1319
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:51,350
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1320
01:45:57,592 --> 01:45:59,958
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1321
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:03,326
You sign that paper...

1322
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:05,825
...it'll take care of your family...

1323
01:46:06,134 --> 01:46:08,364
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1324
01:46:13,141 --> 01:46:15,132
How do you make your mark?

1325
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:18,873
Can you hold a pen?

1326
01:46:19,047 --> 01:46:21,413
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1327
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:23,642
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1328
01:46:25,053 --> 01:46:26,748
Here you go, honey.

1329
01:46:29,891 --> 01:46:31,950
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1330
01:46:32,227 --> 01:46:34,388
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1331
01:46:35,897 --> 01:46:37,524
I did pretty good.

1332
01:46:37,699 --> 01:46:39,564
You lost, Mary M.

1333
01:46:40,502 --> 01:46:44,199
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

1334
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,570
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

1335
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:50,568
There you go.

1336
01:46:59,888 --> 01:47:01,788
What happened to you?

1337
01:47:02,123 --> 01:47:03,818
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1338
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:09,096
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
And get home.

1339
01:47:10,932 --> 01:47:14,265
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1340
01:47:14,435 --> 01:47:17,666
...you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1341
01:47:20,508 --> 01:47:22,908
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

1342
01:47:23,077 --> 01:47:26,308
...from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

1343
01:47:28,416 --> 01:47:31,681
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1344
01:48:12,994 --> 01:48:17,124
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

1345
01:48:30,678 --> 01:48:32,805
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1346
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,342
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1347
01:49:54,329 --> 01:49:57,196
They took my leg, boss.

1348
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:04,538
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1349
01:50:05,373 --> 01:50:08,774
I always hear your voice, boss.

1350
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:42,065
You need anything?

1351
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:48,474
I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.

1352
01:50:50,218 --> 01:50:52,015
But you didn't win.

1353
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:54,520
I don't have to tell you.

1354
01:50:58,259 --> 01:51:00,819
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1355
01:51:00,995 --> 01:51:03,293
No wonder no one loves you.

1356
01:51:06,868 --> 01:51:09,268
You remind me of my daddy.

1357
01:51:11,973 --> 01:51:13,941
Well, he must have been...

1358
01:51:14,442 --> 01:51:17,741
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1359
01:51:21,582 --> 01:51:24,745
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1360
01:51:26,654 --> 01:51:28,087
No, I was...

1361
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:32,491
...Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1362
01:51:34,796 --> 01:51:37,128
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1363
01:51:37,565 --> 01:51:41,001
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1364
01:51:41,803 --> 01:51:44,772
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1365
01:51:49,844 --> 01:51:52,244
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1366
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:56,211
Sure.

1367
01:51:57,585 --> 01:51:59,576
Anything you want.

1368
01:52:01,289 --> 01:52:04,258
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1369
01:52:17,138 --> 01:52:19,606
Don't even think about that.

1370
01:52:23,478 --> 01:52:25,912
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1371
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:30,913
Not after what I done.

1372
01:52:31,085 --> 01:52:33,076
I seen the world.

1373
01:52:36,157 --> 01:52:38,352
People chanted my name.

1374
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,520
Well...

1375
01:52:42,463 --> 01:52:45,955
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1376
01:52:48,970 --> 01:52:51,438
But they were chanting for me.

1377
01:52:54,976 --> 01:52:57,342
I was in magazines.

1378
01:53:01,115 --> 01:53:03,879
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1379
01:53:08,289 --> 01:53:11,952
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1380
01:53:15,396 --> 01:53:18,991
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1381
01:53:22,336 --> 01:53:24,702
...and I'd fight my way out.

1382
01:53:29,644 --> 01:53:32,579
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1383
01:53:34,749 --> 01:53:37,217
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1384
01:53:40,154 --> 01:53:41,553
I got what I needed.

1385
01:53:45,526 --> 01:53:48,017
I got it all.

1386
01:53:51,532 --> 01:53:54,592
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

1387
01:53:59,674 --> 01:54:04,634
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1388
01:54:09,617 --> 01:54:11,881
I can't.

1389
01:54:12,587 --> 01:54:14,680
Please.

1390
01:54:16,724 --> 01:54:19,215
Please, don't ask me.

1391
01:54:21,329 --> 01:54:23,422
I'm asking.

1392
01:54:27,001 --> 01:54:28,901
I can't.

1393
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,771
Hello?

1394
01:55:19,954 --> 01:55:22,218
In the middle of the night...

1395
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:25,382
...Maggie had found her own solution.

1396
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,121
She had bit her tongue.

1397
01:55:35,236 --> 01:55:38,069
Stop. Stop.

1398
01:55:41,542 --> 01:55:44,170
Look at me. Look at me.

1399
01:55:58,492 --> 01:56:02,258
Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.

1400
01:56:02,697 --> 01:56:07,066
She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.

1401
01:56:07,368 --> 01:56:09,529
They stitched her up again...

1402
01:56:09,704 --> 01:56:12,901
...padded the tongue
so she couldn 't bite.

1403
01:56:31,225 --> 01:56:33,557
You can ' t do it, you know that.

1404
01:56:35,396 --> 01:56:37,364
I do, Father.

1405
01:56:38,332 --> 01:56:40,300
But you don't know how thick she is...

1406
01:56:40,468 --> 01:56:42,993
...how hard it was to train her.

1407
01:56:43,437 --> 01:56:47,305
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1408
01:56:47,475 --> 01:56:52,936
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1409
01:56:53,647 --> 01:56:55,877
How she fought for the title, I...

1410
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,574
It wasn't by anything...

1411
01:56:57,752 --> 01:57:00,778
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1412
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:12,128
But now she wants to die...

1413
01:57:12,299 --> 01:57:14,529
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1414
01:57:18,873 --> 01:57:23,105
And I swear to God, Father, it's...

1415
01:57:23,577 --> 01:57:26,444
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1416
01:57:26,614 --> 01:57:30,015
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1417
01:57:30,451 --> 01:57:33,443
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1418
01:57:34,789 --> 01:57:37,622
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1419
01:57:37,792 --> 01:57:39,726
You leave her with God.

1420
01:57:40,394 --> 01:57:43,955
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1421
01:57:44,131 --> 01:57:48,090
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1422
01:57:48,302 --> 01:57:50,293
The only person comes
to church that much...

1423
01:57:50,471 --> 01:57:52,132
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1424
01:57:52,306 --> 01:57:54,672
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1425
01:57:55,176 --> 01:57:57,644
...they're nothing compared to this.

1426
01:57:58,012 --> 01:58:02,176
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1427
01:58:02,349 --> 01:58:05,409
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1428
01:58:08,889 --> 01:58:11,153
Somewhere so deep...

1429
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,394
...you'll never find yourself again.

1430
01:58:21,569 --> 01:58:24,003
I think I did it already.

1431
01:58:45,893 --> 01:58:49,226
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1432
01:59:54,428 --> 01:59:57,090
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1433
01:59:58,832 --> 02:00:00,823
You must have been somewhere else.

1434
02:00:02,002 --> 02:00:03,867
Yeah.

1435
02:00:07,708 --> 02:00:09,801
You got a fight I don't know about?

1436
02:00:15,215 --> 02:00:17,479
It wasn't your fault.

1437
02:00:17,918 --> 02:00:20,045
I was wrong to say that.

1438
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:22,255
You're damn right.

1439
02:00:23,657 --> 02:00:24,988
I found you a fighter...

1440
02:00:25,159 --> 02:00:28,686
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

1441
02:00:31,298 --> 02:00:32,731
I killed her.

1442
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,765
Don't say that.

1443
02:00:35,169 --> 02:00:37,694
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1444
02:00:37,871 --> 02:00:41,068
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

1445
02:00:41,241 --> 02:00:44,642
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1446
02:00:44,812 --> 02:00:46,040
You did that.

1447
02:00:48,282 --> 02:00:50,807
People die every day, Frankie.

1448
02:00:50,985 --> 02:00:52,850
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1449
02:00:53,187 --> 02:00:55,121
And you know what
their last thought is?

1450
02:00:55,289 --> 02:00:57,757
"I never got my shot."

1451
02:00:58,258 --> 02:01:00,556
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1452
02:01:01,795 --> 02:01:05,492
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

1453
02:01:06,367 --> 02:01:08,733
"I think I did all right."

1454
02:01:16,343 --> 02:01:18,903
I know I could rest with that.

1455
02:01:21,582 --> 02:01:22,640
Yeah.

1456
02:01:23,217 --> 02:01:25,048
Yeah.

1457
02:01:36,096 --> 02:01:37,791
Yeah.

1458
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:17,469
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1459
02:02:17,638 --> 02:02:19,128
Yeah.

1460
02:02:46,066 --> 02:02:47,693
All right.

1461
02:02:51,872 --> 02:02:54,340
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1462
02:02:55,209 --> 02:02:57,473
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1463
02:03:02,182 --> 02:03:04,912
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

1464
02:03:06,019 --> 02:03:07,611
...stay asleep.

1465
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,723
Mo cuishle...

1466
02:03:16,296 --> 02:03:19,857
...means "my darling, my blood."

1467
02:04:27,968 --> 02:04:30,766
He gave her a single shot.

1468
02:04:31,138 --> 02:04:35,370
It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.

1469
02:04:35,709 --> 02:04:38,576
He didn 't want her
going through this again.

1470
02:05:28,428 --> 02:05:30,123
Then he walked out.

1471
02:05:30,731 --> 02:05:34,030
I don 't think he had anything left.

1472
02:05:52,586 --> 02:05:54,816
I went back to the gym.

1473
02:05:55,122 --> 02:05:58,785
Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.

1474
02:06:18,412 --> 02:06:21,848
And that's when a ghost
came through the door.

1475
02:06:24,384 --> 02:06:27,444
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

1476
02:06:28,522 --> 02:06:30,183
What was that, Danger?

1477
02:06:31,792 --> 02:06:34,386
Anybody can lose one fight.

1478
02:06:35,629 --> 02:06:37,460
That's the truth.

1479
02:06:38,298 --> 02:06:40,858
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1480
02:06:42,836 --> 02:06:45,304
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1481
02:07:04,124 --> 02:07:07,252
Frankie never came back at all.

1482
02:07:22,042 --> 02:07:26,206
Frankie didn 't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.

1483
02:07:26,546 --> 02:07:29,071
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...

1484
02:07:29,249 --> 02:07:32,241
...and ask you one more time
to forgive him.

1485
02:07:32,419 --> 02:07:35,855
But maybe he didn 't have
anything left in his heart.

1486
02:07:36,023 --> 02:07:39,390
I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.

1487
02:07:39,893 --> 02:07:42,953
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1488
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:46,527
Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.

1489
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:50,261
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1490
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:52,762
No matter where he is...

1491
02:07:53,306 --> 02:07:58,039
...I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.

1492
02:08:09,594 --> 02:08:15,594
