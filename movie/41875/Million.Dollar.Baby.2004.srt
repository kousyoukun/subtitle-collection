6
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,013
Do it!

7
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:53,246
Get him! Get him!

8
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,549
You got him!

9
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,333
l only ever met one man l wouldn't want to fight.

10
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,171
l can't stop that.

11
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:17,309
Get outta here, you useless tit.

12
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:20,210
When l met him, he was already the best cut man in the business.

13
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,281
Can you stop it?

14
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,977
Started training and managing in the

15
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:25,347
'60s, but he never lost his gift.

16
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:26,579
No.

17
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:35,555
Let me have a look at him.

18
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:38,222
He's fine. He's fine.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,666
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding. l'll give you one more round.

20
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,366
Seconds up. Let's go.

21
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:47,337
What do we do? Tell me what to do.

22
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,541
You let him hit you.

23
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:55,577
Sometimes there's just nothing you can do.

24
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,079
Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.

25
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:01,889
Maybe you got a severed vein...

26
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:05,026
...or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.

27
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,563
There are all kinds of combinations you come up against...

28
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,496
...down in the different layers of meat...

29
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,861
...and Frankie knew how to work every one.

30
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:43,397
People love violence.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,228
They'll slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies.

32
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,564
Same people claim to love boxing.

33
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,673
They got no idea what it is.

34
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,508
Boxing is about respect.

35
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,941
Getting it for yourself...

36
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,244
...and taking it away from the other guy.

37
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,483
l'll warm up the car.

38
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:06,848
Mr. Dunn?

39
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,285
l owe you money?

40
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,551
No, sir.

41
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,054
l know your mama?

42
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,390
l don't rightly know, sir.

43
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:15,928
Then what is it you want?

44
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:19,966
l was on the undercard. l won my fight, too. Maggie Fitzgerald?

45
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,896
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

46
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,531
-Did you happen to see it?

47
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:25,401
-Nope.

48
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,701
l did pretty good.

49
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,942
Thought you might be interested in training me.

50
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,369
l don't train girls.

51
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:32,703
Maybe you should. People see me fight,

52
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:34,577
say l'm pretty tough.

53
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:38,615
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

54
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:53,359
lt's a mistake.

55
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:01,636
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

56
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,542
Just push, will ya?

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,172
-What did Hogan want?

58
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,306
-Offered us a title shot.

59
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:09,849
About time.

60
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,576
l turned him down flat.

61
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,615
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

62
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,586
Been two or three more fights for a long time now, Frankie.

63
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,031
Willie, you get one shot at the title.

64
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,102
You lose it, it may not come around again.

65
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,769
Now, two or three more fights nd we'll be ready.

66
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,235
Whatever you say, Frankie.

67
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:39,644
Frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act...

68
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:42,548
...that everything in boxing is backwards.

69
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,013
Sometimes...

70
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:49,750
...best way to deliver a punch is step back.

71
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,702
Well, do Your best, Lord...

72
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:03,827
...protect Katy.

73
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,204
Annie, too.

74
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,834
Other than that...

75
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,839
...You know what l want, there's no use me repeating myself.

76
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:17,683
But step back too far, you ain't fighting at all.

77
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:35,265
Bye.

78
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:40,541
Father, that was a great sermon, made me weep.

79
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,533
What's confusing you this week?

80
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:45,202
Same old one. God, three God thing.

81
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,276
Frankie, most people figure out by kindergarten it's about faith.

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,415
ls it sort of like Snap, Crackle, and Pop all rolled up in one big box?

83
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,685
You're standing outside my church

84
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:57,849
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

85
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,218
You come to mass every day only to wind me up.

86
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:01,624
lt won't happen this morning.

87
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:02,661
l'm confused.

88
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:03,321
-No, you aren't.

89
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:04,090
-Yes, l am.

90
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,929
Then here's your answer: There's one God.

91
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,293
Anything else? Because l'm busy.

92
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:10,462
-What about the Holy Ghost?

93
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:11,937
-He's an expression of God's love.

94
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:12,768
-And Jesus? -Son of God.

95
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:15,001
Don't play stupid!

96
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,372
What is he, then? Does that make him a demigod?

97
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:20,003
There are no demigods, you fucking pagan!

98
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,349
-Did you write your daughter?

99
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,352
-Absolutely.

100
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,287
Now you're lying to a priest.

101
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,326
You know what? Take a day off, don't come to mass tomorrow.

102
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:47,834
Some people'd say the most important thing a fighter can have is heart.

103
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:50,202
Frankie'd say,

104
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,740
''Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart...

105
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:54,781
...and l'll show you a man waiting for a beating.''

106
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:06,861
l think l only ever met one fighter who was all heart.

107
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,895
My name's Dangerous Dillard Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

108
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:14,264
...out of Broward County, Texas!

109
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,269
Danger showed up couple of years back.

110
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,336
He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel, his mama's new boyfriend.

111
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:30,440
Apparently Ervel got lost and ended up back in Texas.

112
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:35,785
Danger looked for him for about a week before he introduced himself.

113
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:42,661
You know, l gots nothin' against niggers.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,399
That's nice to hear.

115
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:51,032
Lotsa people where l comes from does...

116
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,802
...but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man...

117
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:56,476
...niggers or not.

118
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:59,570
You got a nice mama. Anything else l can do for you?

119
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:01,740
Just one of those questions you ask,

120
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:04,209
but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.

121
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:08,312
l'd likes to become the Welterweight Champion of the world.

122
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,628
And l challenge the Motor City Cobra...

123
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,526
...Thomas ''Hit Man'' Hearns...

124
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:19,658
...to fight me for the Welterweight Championship of the whole world!

125
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,827
Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.

126
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:25,565
You gotta have at least one fight to be ranked.

127
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,504
l'll fight any man, anytime!

128
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,243
You a bad man, huh?

129
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,570
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

130
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,079
Shawrelle...

131
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,305
l will.

132
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:36,973
...leave him alone.

133
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,320
Danger, go on back to training.

134
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,856
Will do, Mist' Scrap!

135
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,458
Them some nice tights, Danger.

136
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,194
l'll give you that ass-whuppin' later, Olive Oyl.

137
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,667
Those pants look real pretty on you, bro.

138
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:57,464
Give his mama back her tights.

139
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,097
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook that would move a tank...

140
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,142
...but he had a heart the size of a split pea.

141
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:07,211
Frankie bought the Hit Pit

142
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:08,976
from Bobby Malone 1 7 years ago.

143
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,846
Bobby wanted to move to Florida and

144
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,851
Frankie wanted some security.

145
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,182
Bobby died while he was packing.

146
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:19,624
Frankie found out most gyms lose money.

147
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:22,928
l thought l told you l didn't want Danger working out here anymore.

148
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,858
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,594
Well, he's hurting me.

150
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:30,237
Breaking my heart watching him punch the air like it's gonna punch back.

151
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,636
And how many times have l gotta tell you that bleach is bleach?

152
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,546
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff? You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

153
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,544
lt smells better, Frankie.

154
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,883
Bleach smells like bleach!

155
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:53,457
-Hey, Scrap.

156
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:54,653
-Hey, Mr. Willie!

157
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,633
Nice fight last night.

158
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,175
-Big Willie!

159
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,574
-Hey, Sally.

160
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,974
Nice fight. People are talking.

161
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:35,666
What the hell kind of language is that?

162
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,638
What do you want?

163
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,407
l thought you might like to know you

164
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,511
got a fighter not talking to another manager.

165
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,139
Not talking to another manager?

166
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:48,772
And not just any manager...

167
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,679
...Mickey Mack.

168
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:54,749
You came in here to tell me that Big

169
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,723
Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

170
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:00,325
Not a word. Neither one of them.

171
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:03,425
l'm trying to read here.

172
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,265
Well, if you think that's more important.

173
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:09,700
Who's your new girl?

174
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:12,364
What?!

175
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:25,548
Jesus Christ.

176
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,846
Better hurry up. lf she keeps hitting it like that,

177
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:29,786
she gonna break her wrists.

178
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,333
You're wasting your time. l told you l don't train girls.

179
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:42,936
Thought you might change your mind.

180
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,473
Dozens of trainers train girls.

181
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,097
You won't have any trouble finding one.

182
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:49,710
Don't need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

183
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:53,539
Don't call me boss, now. l'm not your boss, and don't you be calling me that.

184
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:54,875
-Willie, you ready to work?

185
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:55,948
-Anytime.

186
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,410
lf l stop calling you boss, will you train me?

187
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,313
No.

188
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,719
Then l might as well keep calling you it.

189
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:08,219
She came from southwestern Missouri...

190
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:12,357
...the hills outside the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia...

191
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,997
...set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and good-bye.

192
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,066
She grew up knowing one thing:

193
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,107
She was trash.

194
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,354
lt's for my dog.

195
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,584
She'd come 1800 miles,

196
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:42,492
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

197
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:02,814
Working the bag, boss.

198
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,182
Not your boss. And that bag's working you.

199
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:22,400
Give her her money back.

200
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,072
You sure?

201
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:27,639
-How much did she pay?

202
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,036
-Six months.

203
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,305
-Jesus Christ.

204
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:32,413
-No, l'll give it back.

205
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,777
No, don't be a smart-ass now, will ya?

206
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:37,450
Woman thinks l'll throw away six months' worth of dues...

207
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,076
...just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

208
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:42,314
But just don't encourage her, understand?

209
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:46,521
And what's Danger doing out there? What's he looking at?

210
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,523
Looks like a bottle of water.

211
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,069
He paid his dues?

212
00:13:56,838 --> 00:14:01,070
Dues?! Boy can't afford pants, want him to pay dues?

213
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,167
Get out of my office.

214
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:15,482
Fuck me.

215
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:02,698
Can't think of it as a bag.

216
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:10,441
l'm not a trainer, but l can show you this, if you'd like.

217
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:12,240
Appreciate any help l can get.

218
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,480
You want to think of it as a man, see?

219
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:19,548
He's constantly moving.

220
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,248
He's moving towards you, around you, away from you.

221
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,050
All right?

222
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,322
Don't hit him when he's coming towards

223
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,861
you because he'll just push you back...

224
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,090
...he'll smother your punches, take your balance, right?

225
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,996
So, you watch him real carefully.

226
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,535
Keep rotating and keep your head moving...

227
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,269
...and keep one shoulder back so you're

228
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,374
always ready to fire a power shot.

229
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,839
Go ahead, now. Good, good.

230
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,035
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

231
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,812
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

232
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:52,352
Come on around. Keep moving, keep moving.

233
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,080
-Good, good, good.

234
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:55,120
-Like that?

235
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:56,985
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

236
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:00,752
Tuck that chin in now, tuck that chin in.

237
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,593
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

238
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,658
Now, you get this down, we'll put you on the speed bag.

239
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,769
You do have a speed bag.

240
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:27,114
l'll just borrow it till l can buy my own.

241
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:28,820
All right. You go on home now.

242
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,448
-l'll walk out with you?

243
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:31,984
-l am home.

244
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:33,458
-Want to see?

245
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:34,527
-Yeah.

246
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:44,462
lt's nice.

247
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,768
Would it bother you much if l worked a little longer?

248
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,071
Nah, just pull the door closed when you leave.

249
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:57,849
Thank you.

250
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,300
lf there's magic in boxing...

251
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,999
...it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance...

252
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:23,975
...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys,

253
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,943
and detached retinas.

254
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:39,153
lt's the magic of risking everything,

255
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:41,194
for a dream that nobody sees but you.

256
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,930
Okay. Watch the footwork!

257
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,502
That's it.

258
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:15,560
Hey, Flip.

259
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,097
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

260
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,333
l think l found somebody you can beat.

261
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,500
l don't fights women.

262
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,701
Why not, bro? lt's perfect, bro. You know why?

263
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,611
'Cause she, nah, you, you could fight to him...

264
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,371
...and then you could kiss to him.

265
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,142
Then fight one more time.

266
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,442
That's beautiful, man, that's like poetry!

267
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:40,548
lt's like poetry.

268
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,019
You been reading and shit.

269
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,646
That's a girl, man?

270
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:47,017
l think you right. Look at her little titties.

271
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,061
They're like mosquito bites.

272
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:51,165
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.

273
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,333
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

274
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,399
Spent so much time face down, l thought the canvas had titties.

275
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:03,171
Canvas has titties!

276
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:05,442
Look at me! l'm Shawrelle!

277
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:17,452
Just humping the canvas. Humping the floor.

278
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:22,986
Come on, bro, the floor having titties, that's funny, bro.

279
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:24,290
Shut up, man.

280
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,896
What you laughing at?!

281
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:28,963
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

282
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:36,074
Yo, when they start making those tights for men, Flippy?

283
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:37,835
Punk.

284
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:42,174
All right, that's enough. That's enough for the day.

285
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:46,577
l'll give you a rubdown.

286
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:49,348
l can't. My middle one's got a piano lesson.

287
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,014
l told Grace l'd drive her.

288
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,092
Something wrong with Gracie's car?

289
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,319
She hates that car.

290
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:57,920
Wants the old one back, but the dealer already got a buyer.

291
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,863
Maybe l should talk to the dealer.

292
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,201
l'd appreciate that.

293
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:03,668
Okay.

294
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:05,103
Thanks.

295
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:06,340
See you later.

296
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:18,280
The man's a rubdown whore and today he doesn't want one?

297
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,479
You ever do any work around here?

298
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:24,753
Not my job l'd worry about, if l was you.

299
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:30,423
Little girl seems to be coming along.

300
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:34,868
Yeah. lt's almost like somebody's been helping her.

301
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:38,237
She might just be a natural.

302
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,198
Looks like she's got something.

303
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,711
She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got!

304
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,210
l wonder how the hell she got that.

305
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,577
l wonder.

306
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:02,058
l'm gonna need that speed bag back.

307
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:02,753
-This bag? -Yes, that bag.

308
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:04,592
That's my bag.

309
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,596
lf you're hitting it, people will think l'm training you.

310
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,430
ls that such a bad thing, boss?

311
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,662
Yes, it is.

312
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:14,504
Every time you touch it, you're losing me business out here.

313
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,838
l gotta agree, l am embarrassing myself.

314
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:22,275
Yeah. Well, l can't just lend it to anybody, you know?

315
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,440
l understand.

316
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,082
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

317
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,722
-Can l give you some advice?

318
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,986
-l'd appreciate that.

319
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:39,365
You'll find a trainer in this gym or elsewhere that will want to train a girl.

320
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,593
lt's the latest freak show out there.

321
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:44,169
But the only trouble is they'll be

322
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,738
wasting your time because you're too old.

323
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,902
l don't feel that old.

324
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:49,804
Neither do l,

325
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:52,344
but you don't see me fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

326
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:56,011
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

327
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:58,344
How old are you?

328
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,714
31 until my next birthday.

329
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,983
There you go. 31 .

330
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,956
You wouldn't start training to be a ballerina at 31 , would you?

331
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:10,063
Already been working it for three years.

332
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,624
And you can't hit a speed bag?

333
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,165
What kind of training is that?

334
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:15,993
l've never had any, boss.

335
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,233
l hate to say it, but it shows.

336
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,600
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

337
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,474
l hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

338
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,044
Yeah.

339
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,308
Sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

340
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:35,549
You're not gonna cry now, are you?

341
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,850
No, sir.

342
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,059
Here.

343
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:45,296
-Keep the goddamn thing.

344
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,195
-No, you need it.

345
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,665
No, take the bag.

346
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,800
l haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

347
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:54,100
l've had three since then.

348
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,074
Just enjoy it, will you?

349
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,303
l'll just borrow it till l buy my own.

350
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,772
Just don't lose it.

351
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,751
Yeah, l know, Hogan, your guy's the champ,

352
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,623
so we don't split fifties...

353
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:16,662
...but if l don't see forty percent--

354
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,895
Call me back when it's sixty-forty or don't call me back at all.

355
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:32,676
Hey, Willie?

356
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:33,936
Hey, Frankie.

357
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,440
ls something wrong?

358
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:37,948
Sorry to come to your house like this,

359
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:39,813
l know you don't like people dropping in.

360
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:42,387
You're not people, Willie, you're welcome anytime.

361
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,421
Come on in.

362
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,249
Thank you for getting Grace's car back.

363
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,422
You don't have to thank me.

364
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:52,521
Paying an extra thousand dollars for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

365
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,902
Gracie broke out and cried when she saw it.

366
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,093
Really?

367
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,769
l also needed to talk with you about business.

368
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:02,136
l just got off the phone with Hogan.

369
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,073
We're all set for September.

370
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,701
Everything but the split.

371
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,047
l gotta leave you, Frankie.

372
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,444
What?

373
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,854
Willie, the title is just two fights away.

374
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,084
lt ain't that.

375
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:22,326
lt's like you said, l got one shot.

376
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:25,862
lf l win, l gotta make as much as l can while l can.

377
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:29,264
l need somebody in the action, who can make things happen.

378
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,595
And l gotta make the change before the fight.

379
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:36,171
Only way this guy say he'd take me is if he took me to the title.

380
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:41,103
So, l get you the title fight, and this guy takes you there?

381
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,112
Only way he'd do it!

382
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:44,577
l'm sorry, Frankie.

383
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,451
l know how long you've been waiting on a title.

384
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,249
l wish it could've been with me.

385
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:52,625
Mickey Mack's a business man.

386
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,420
He can't teach you nothing.

387
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,556
You already taught me everything l need to know.

388
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,772
There's some things that people just don't want to hear.

389
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,715
And l challenge the Motor City

390
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,882
Cobra Thomas Hit Man Hearns...

391
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:28,757
...to fight me for the Welterweight Championship of the whole world!

392
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:32,255
Danger, l'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

393
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,502
Just working on my footwork, Mist' Scrap.

394
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:40,071
Danger, you throw a punch or get the hell out of this gym.

395
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,477
Danger, while you thinking about that punch, l'll be right back.

396
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:54,114
l'm thinking how l'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mist' Scrap!

397
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,723
No one had the heart to tell Danger

398
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:04,860
that Hearn had retired years ago.

399
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,406
l heard about Willie.

400
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,377
That's cold, man, that's dead cold.

401
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,414
Course, it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so damn old.

402
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:24,446
At least l can see through both eyes.

403
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:27,186
Didn't do you a lot of good though, did it?

404
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:30,280
Well, l've got the gym.

405
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:33,219
Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

406
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,686
Willie tell you why?

407
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,729
lt was Mickey. Mickey's got the connections.

408
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,266
Nah, it ain't about connections.

409
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,029
lt's about you not believing in him.

410
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:46,200
l found him, l stuck with him for eight years.

411
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,965
How's that for not believing in him?

412
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,634
You could've got him a title fight two years ago.

413
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:51,870
Hell, he knew that.

414
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,980
l'm amazed he stayed around this long.

415
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:57,207
Getting there and taking home the belt are two different things.

416
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:58,711
What was l supposed to do?

417
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,788
Just put him in over his head, not protect him?

418
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:04,584
You were protecting him from the championship.

419
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:05,714
Yeah.

420
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,054
Well, now it makes sense.

421
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,989
What about you, Scrap? What did your manager do?

422
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,658
You were a hell of a fighter, a lot better than Willie.

423
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,627
He get you a title fight...

424
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,905
...or did he bust you out banging your head against other people's fists...

425
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,771
...until you lost your eye?

426
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,542
l had my shot.

427
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:26,377
l went out swinging and no man can say l didn't.

428
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,776
l remember.

429
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:30,610
And excuse me if l didn't want my

430
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:34,043
fighter spending the second half of his life... ...cleaning up other people's spit.

431
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:39,721
Yeah, you're right. You're the smart one. You're the one learning Greek.

432
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:41,757
lt's Gaelic.

433
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,956
You just protected yourself out of a championship fight.

434
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,232
How do you say that in Gaelic?

435
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,195
Sorry.

436
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:05,610
Thanks.

437
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:10,083
The action continues as the Champ is battling Big Willie Jones...

438
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:13,186
...and commanding him with rights and lefts.

439
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,880
Up against the ropes, he's...

440
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,854
Boxing is an unnatural act.

441
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:22,494
'Cause everything in it is backwards.

442
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,527
You want to move to the left, you don't step left...

443
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,500
...you push on the right toe.

444
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:34,869
To move right, you use your left toe.

445
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:37,533
lnstead of running from the pain,

446
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:39,236
like a sane person would do...

447
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,972
...you step into it.

448
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,781
So Big Willie comes back-- Oh, my God!

449
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:48,282
He hits the champ with a right hand and the champ is down.

450
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:51,355
The Ref is into the count and Big

451
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,117
Willie Jones is the new champion of the world!

452
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:58,754
lt's unbelievable how this has taken place tonight...

453
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:01,834
...but there you have it, folks, a new champion.

454
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,405
Everything in boxing is backwards.

455
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:23,323
Want a cheeseburger?

456
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:25,548
You bought me a cheeseburger?

457
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,893
l never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

458
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:30,821
l couldn't eat it and l ordered it. You want it?

459
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,596
l guess the planet can go back to spinning.

460
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:36,861
You watch the fight?

461
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,596
Yeah, l watched it.

462
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,201
Willie did good.

463
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,577
That's what you got to say?

464
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:46,746
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

465
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,277
l see you been working on yourself,

466
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,515
learning to open up. Good work.

467
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:53,983
You watch it?

468
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,355
Yeah, l got HBO.

469
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,260
How can you afford HBO?

470
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:03,760
How long have l been telling you to save your money?

471
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,088
Since l fought Louis ''Typhoon'' Johnson

472
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:09,327
at the Stadium Club in Tupelo, Mississippi.

473
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,495
That true?

474
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:16,101
Manager ran off and left you and me to hitch home...

475
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,636
...don't you remember nothing?

476
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:21,438
l remember walking halfway, thinking l was gonna be lynched.

477
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,942
l remember you leaving me with my dick in my hand behind that gas station.

478
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,952
l got a ride. The guy took off before l hardly closed the door.

479
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,990
l had to walk back two miles.

480
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,292
Your conscience got the better of you, that's what.

481
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:40,927
What the hell's that?

482
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,335
lt's her birthday.

483
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,393
You're not breathing right. That's why you're panting.

484
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,594
So, it's your birthday, huh?

485
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:13,863
How old does that make you?

486
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:19,071
l'm 32, Mr. Dunn, and l'm here celebrating the fact...

487
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:22,073
that l spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing...

488
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:25,201
...which is what l been doing since 13.

489
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:26,470
And according to you,

490
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,604
l'll be 37 before l can even throw a decent punch...

491
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,607
...which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere...

492
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:33,811
...l now realize may be God's simple truth.

493
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,018
Other truth is, my brother's in prison,

494
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:38,090
my sister cheats on welfare...

495
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,852
...by pretending one of her babies is still alive...

496
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:42,894
...my daddy's dead and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

497
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,395
lf l was thinking straight, l'd go back home...

498
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:50,025
...find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

499
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:54,000
Problem is, this is the only thing l ever felt good doing.

500
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,508
lf l'm too old for this, then l got nothing.

501
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,842
That enough truth to suit you?

502
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:04,210
This your speed bag?

503
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:05,477
Put yours behind the counter.

504
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:07,416
Wish l could say l wore it out.

505
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:12,558
Just hold it. Hold it.

506
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:14,922
l'll show you a few things,

507
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,288
and then we'll get you a trainer.

508
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,988
No, sorry.

509
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:19,665
You're in a position to negotiate?

510
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,598
Yes, sir, because l know if you train me right,

511
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,135
l'm going to be a champ.

512
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,065
l seen you looking at me.

513
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,400
Yeah, out of pity.

514
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:33,476
Don't you say that! Don't you say that if it ain't true!

515
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:36,511
l want a trainer.

516
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,286
l don't want charity, and l don't want favors.

517
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:47,152
lf you're not interested, then l got more Celebrating to do.

518
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:50,688
Stop, stop, stop.

519
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:54,129
Goddamn it, stop.

520
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,726
What the hell are you doing?

521
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:00,971
Okay.

522
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,441
lf l'm going to take you on--

523
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,168
You won't never regret it.

524
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:08,109
Listen to me. lf l take you on--

525
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:10,239
l promise l'll work so hard.

526
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,714
God, this is a mistake already.

527
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,213
l'm listening, boss.

528
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,781
lf l take you on, you don't say anything,

529
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:21,825
you don't question me.

530
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,153
You don't ask, ''Why?'' You don't say

531
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:26,061
anything except maybe ''Yes,Frankie.''

532
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:29,267
And l'm going to try to forget the fact that you're a girl.

533
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:30,835
lt's all l ask.

534
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:33,462
And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

535
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:34,835
-All rightey.

536
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:36,067
-We got a deal.

537
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,807
No, not quite.

538
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:40,375
...l'll teach you how to fight...

539
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,443
then we'll get you a manager and l'm off down the road.

540
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:44,616
l hate to argue with you but--

541
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,981
That's the only way we're doing it.

542
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:48,846
l teach you all you need to know and

543
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,014
you go off and make a million dollars.

544
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:54,216
Get your teeth knocked out, l don't care.

545
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,554
l don't want to hear about it.

546
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:59,629
That's the way it's going to be. lt's the only way l'll do it.

547
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:08,673
All right.

548
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,339
One of the things l've noticed around

549
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,711
the gym is you never move your feet. You stand there just flatfooted.

550
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,548
You've got to move your feet. That's one of the best things l'll be able to teach you.

551
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:22,551
So, here's what you do.

552
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,954
Get yourself, bend your knees a little bit.

553
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:30,319
Get in an athletic position. Look like you're going to hit something.

554
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:33,529
Move them how, boss?

555
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,794
Hit the bag.

556
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,166
-Stop.

557
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:39,168
-What'd l do wrong?

558
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,137
You did two things wrong.

559
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,942
One is you asked a question and two is

560
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,135
you asked another question.

561
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,410
Now, what l want you to do...

562
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:49,208
it's not about hitting it hard,

563
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,214
it's how good you hit it.

564
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,009
So, watch me.

565
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,245
You can count with me if you want.

566
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:58,256
On a one count, l hit right through the bag.

567
00:35:58,392 --> 00:35:59,882
Can you show me that again?

568
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,926
Just say one, please.

569
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:03,461
One.

570
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:04,689
One.

571
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:09,767
Okay. Yeah, just say one, that's good. That's good.

572
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,997
Then l move over to my right foot.

573
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,300
See, my weight is shifting to my right foot.

574
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:16,800
Then l hit it with my back of my hand,

575
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:19,810
like l'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

576
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:22,915
Then l come over and l shift to my left foot...

577
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,574
...and l hit it with my right hand...

578
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:28,086
and ice pick maneuver again...

579
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:32,590
and l come over on my right foot, and hit it right, left.

580
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,089
Don't watch anything but my feet.

581
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:49,936
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

582
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:24,365
You show them how to stand, keep their legs Under their shoulders.

583
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,883
To make a fighter, you got to strip them down to bare wood.

584
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,786
Rest when you're dead. Come here.

585
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,662
You can't just tell them to forget everything you know...

586
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,860
because you got to make them forget it in their bones.

587
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,971
Make them so tired they only listen to you,

588
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,873
only hear your voice...

589
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,410
only do what you say, and nothing else.

590
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:04,584
Move your feet around, let's see you go.

591
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,429
Show them how to keep their balance

592
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:23,900
and take it away from the other guy.

593
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,730
Not so low. Look at me, right hook and just turn right.

594
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:34,074
How to generate momentum off your right toe...

595
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:38,582
and how to flex your knees when you fire a jab.

596
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,916
How to fight backing up, so the other

597
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,153
guy doesn't want to come after you.

598
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:54,293
Then you got to show them all over again. Over and over and over.

599
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:56,594
Till they think they were born that way.

600
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,363
Shift. Shift away.

601
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:09,373
Okay, that's enough for today. Good work. Good girl.

602
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,312
Think l'm ready for a fight, boss?

603
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:39,645
Come here.

604
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:44,344
You're not breathing.

605
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:47,682
Hate to disagree with you.

606
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:50,987
Every time you get under pressure, you're holding your breath.

607
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:52,352
Now stop doing that.

608
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:56,926
Okay. But other than that, l'm doing pretty good, right?

609
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,425
l mean, for a girl.

610
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,189
l don't train girls.

611
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:06,028
You think l might be ready for a fight, boss?

612
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,935
We'll get a manager and we'll find out, won't we?

613
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,501
l'd like to but you've been keeping me too busy.

614
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,581
-Got any family, boss?

615
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:22,979
-What?

616
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,318
You been spending all this time with me. l didn't know if you had any.

617
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:30,721
No.

618
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,726
Well, l've got a daughter. Katy.

619
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:36,963
That's family.

620
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:39,532
We're not exactly close.

621
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,434
How much she weigh?

622
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:43,910
What?

623
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:47,002
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

624
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:53,283
Not very big.

625
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:58,121
Used to be real athletic, don't know if she kept it up.

626
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:06,990
So, what do you think?

627
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:09,465
l ready for a fight?

628
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:16,673
Hey, Sally.

629
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:20,745
Come here for a minute, will you?

630
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:25,575
Frankie? l need to see you in the back for a minute, okay?

631
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,416
Can l see you a minute?

632
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:29,350
Sally here's a real good manager.

633
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,185
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.

634
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,656
Looking for a girl, Sally?

635
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,192
l'm looking for a good one.

636
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,896
Well, see, there you go.

637
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,828
Nice working with you, girlie.

638
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,266
-What'd you want?

639
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:49,466
-Nothing.

640
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,379
l ain't lying, l been watching you work. You got a hell of a left.

641
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,470
Thank you.

642
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,718
You want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?

643
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:04,884
Yeah, sure.

644
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,794
Good, because l think you're ready for a fight.

645
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:22,570
Break!

646
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:27,340
What am l doing wrong? Every time l get inside, she's on me.

647
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,072
You're doing great. You're wearing her down, just keep punching.

648
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,979
l ain't doing great. l'm losing.

649
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:34,049
You're wearing her down.

650
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:57,970
Nice night, ain't it?

651
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,372
Jesus Christ.

652
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,278
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

653
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,848
Hell of a fighter. 1 1-0.

654
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,654
Your left. Keep your left up.

655
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:16,385
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

656
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:19,689
He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ?

657
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,258
Your left, damn it.

658
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:27,138
Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight,

659
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,067
but Sally's a good manager.

660
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,933
He must think she can take her.

661
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:34,478
Jesus H! Your left! Keep your left up.

662
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:37,715
You think she can hear you from back here?

663
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:48,984
Of course, if Maggie loses, it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

664
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:51,329
Might even help him.

665
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:53,361
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

666
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,365
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight

667
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:57,697
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

668
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:01,031
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

669
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:04,670
Hey, what do l know? l just come because l enjoy the fights.

670
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:07,242
Mother of God.

671
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:09,874
Okay, break!

672
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:12,581
Come here.

673
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:14,553
Get over here!

674
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:17,656
You're dropping your left hand. Quit dropping your left hand.

675
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:20,016
You mind if l talk to my fighter?

676
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,128
You're doing a hell of a job. ls this the way you advise your lightweight?

677
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:27,159
Dunn, what the hell are you doing?

678
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,766
l'm talking. What are you doing?

679
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:29,662
-ls this your fighter?

680
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:30,894
-lt's my fighter!

681
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,106
lt ain't fitting real well, Sally.

682
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,670
Fine. You take her. She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

683
00:44:37,877 --> 00:44:39,367
Somebody tell me what's going on!

684
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:42,173
l was late. Sally was subbing for me.

685
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:43,838
This is your fighter?

686
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,181
Yeah. This is my fighter.

687
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:50,651
Then you got ten seconds!

688
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:54,352
l keep holding my left up, then l throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

689
00:44:54,627 --> 00:44:55,855
-Well, let it drop.

690
00:44:56,062 --> 00:44:56,824
-That'd be a lot easier.

691
00:44:56,963 --> 00:44:58,225
She thinks she knows you.

692
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:01,128
Every time you drop it she comes over the top.

693
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,460
So you just wait for her, see?

694
00:45:03,636 --> 00:45:04,830
That's all she's thinking about.

695
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:07,132
And when she cocks that big right hand...

696
00:45:07,273 --> 00:45:07,898
l hear you.

697
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,875
step to the side and come over with a big good night hook.

698
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:13,000
Got it right here.

699
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:15,874
Fight or l'm calling it!

700
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:16,845
Go give it to her!

701
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:20,544
The body knows what fighters don't, how to protect itself.

702
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,352
A neck can only twist so far.

703
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:27,151
Twist it just a hair more and the body says:

704
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:28,888
''l'll take it from here, because you

705
00:45:29,195 --> 00:45:30,890
obviously don't know what you're doing.''

706
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:36,162
See the way she did that?

707
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:38,031
Sugar Ray would do that.

708
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,466
Girl's got sugar.

709
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:41,904
''Lie down, now, rest and we'll talk

710
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,509
about this when you regain your senses.''

711
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,913
lt's called the knockout mechanism.

712
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,914
Don't get carried away, now. You did good.

713
00:45:51,117 --> 00:45:52,641
Thanks, boss.

714
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,820
You forgot the rule. Now, what is the rule?

715
00:45:58,024 --> 00:45:58,956
Keep my left up?

716
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,822
lt's to protect yourself at all times.

717
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:04,453
Now, what is the rule?

718
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:05,928
Protect myself at all times.

719
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:07,327
Good.

720
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,130
You gave me away. How was that protecting me?

721
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:12,702
lt wasn't.

722
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,007
lt's okay.

723
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:17,843
l'll work on my left, boss.

724
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:18,966
Drink your water.

725
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:22,646
Other than that, how'd l do?

726
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:25,908
Fine. You did fine.

727
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,610
You going to leave me again?

728
00:46:31,024 --> 00:46:31,956
Never.

729
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:36,920
That place you work, do they have homemade lemon meringue pie?

730
00:46:37,597 --> 00:46:38,188
Sure.

731
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:40,356
Not with the canned filling crap?

732
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,334
Big can, yea size. Says ''homemade'' on the label.

733
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:48,271
l want you to take the weekend off.

734
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:49,772
lt's only Thursday.

735
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:52,638
You going to argue with me?

736
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:54,879
Know better than to do that, boss.

737
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:57,011
Good.

738
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,574
All fighters are pig-headed some way or other.

739
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:03,713
Some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something.

740
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,118
Can you spare a few minutes for the lmmaculate Conception?

741
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:13,129
Truth is, even if they're wrong...

742
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:16,793
even if that one thing is going to be the ruin of them...

743
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:19,699
...if you can beat that last bit out of them,

744
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:21,836
then they ain't fighters at all.

745
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:23,669
Thought l said l'd see you Monday.

746
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,072
You sure did, boss.

747
00:47:25,745 --> 00:47:27,076
That was last night.

748
00:47:27,413 --> 00:47:28,937
You said not to argue with you.

749
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:43,793
Damn woman won't do a thing l tell her.

750
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:45,855
You want my advice?

751
00:47:46,432 --> 00:47:47,330
What?

752
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:50,232
Where are your shoes?

753
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,433
l'm airing out my feet.

754
00:47:55,475 --> 00:47:57,875
You got big holes in your socks.

755
00:47:58,311 --> 00:47:59,801
They're not that big.

756
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:04,376
Didn't l give you money for some new ones?

757
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:08,044
These are my sleeping socks.

758
00:48:09,088 --> 00:48:11,215
My feet like a little air at night.

759
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:14,484
How come you're wearing them in the daytime, then?

760
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,760
Because my daytime socks got too many holes in them.

761
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,162
Well, if l give you some more money,

762
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:25,133
you buy some new socks.

763
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:26,964
Please?

764
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:33,503
Well, l'd be tempted, but l couldn't say for sure.

765
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,745
Might find its way to the track.

766
00:48:52,298 --> 00:48:53,822
lt's over! lt's over!

767
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,177
Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.

768
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,357
l got the breathing thing down.

769
00:49:26,499 --> 00:49:27,693
No, you ain't breathing, because you're

770
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:30,132
knocking them out in the first round.

771
00:49:30,236 --> 00:49:31,203
Thought that was the point.

772
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:32,804
The point is to get good.

773
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:36,840
Can't get good if you keep knocking them out in the first round.

774
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,640
How am l going to get you fights?

775
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:43,313
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed.

776
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:45,917
Why am l still doing four-rounders, boss?

777
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:48,847
You haven't got the lungs for six rounds.

778
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:51,320
l do if l keep knocking them out in the first round.

779
00:49:56,028 --> 00:49:58,826
Frankie made her fight one more four- rounder...

780
00:49:59,465 --> 00:50:01,399
...just to let her know who was boss.

781
00:50:11,244 --> 00:50:12,211
Sorry, boss.

782
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:14,913
Maggie left no doubt about it.

783
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,414
All right!

784
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:31,327
Her first six-rounder didn't go quite as smooth.

785
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:50,179
To your corner!

786
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:55,917
Three, four, five, six, seven...

787
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:59,655
...eight, nine, ten! lt's over!

788
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,396
Maggie didn't knock her out till the end of the first round.

789
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,222
After that, no manager wanted to put

790
00:51:07,366 --> 00:51:09,334
his fighter in with Maggie.

791
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:16,999
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights...

792
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:20,203
...sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side.

793
00:51:33,092 --> 00:51:35,083
That only worked for so long.

794
00:51:35,728 --> 00:51:38,162
Then Frankie did something he hated doing.

795
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,159
He took a chance.

796
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:51,166
He moved her up in class.

797
00:51:51,577 --> 00:51:53,568
That could've been a mistake.

798
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:21,998
Break! Step back! Break!

799
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:23,369
Time!

800
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:37,155
l'm all right.

801
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:40,023
Give us two seconds, will you? Just two seconds.

802
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:43,053
Your nose is broke.

803
00:52:43,195 --> 00:52:44,753
-Dang! Fix it.

804
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:45,921
-l can't.

805
00:52:46,098 --> 00:52:47,087
You can fix it.

806
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:48,756
l can't. l've got to call it.

807
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:50,993
l've seen what you can do! Fix it!

808
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,764
l can snap it back into place, but l can't stop the bleeding.

809
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:55,373
The ring doctor's going to call it.

810
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:58,233
Please, Frankie. lf you can stop the blood l can beat her.

811
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:01,844
Bite down on this.

812
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:21,625
lnhale.

813
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:22,256
-What?

814
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:23,732
-lnhale.

815
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:25,697
Breathe in!

816
00:53:37,116 --> 00:53:37,707
Okay, huh?

817
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,839
Yeah, it's okay.

818
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:42,715
You got 20 seconds before this turns

819
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:44,880
into a geyser and sprays the front row.

820
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:47,523
20 seconds, that's all you've got.

821
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,727
Now get going.

822
00:54:02,475 --> 00:54:03,339
Go to your corner!

823
00:54:04,376 --> 00:54:08,210
Two, three, four, five...

824
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:11,581
...six, seven, eight...

825
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:13,811
...nine, ten!

826
00:54:17,723 --> 00:54:19,247
MoGuishle Mo Cuishle.

827
00:54:34,073 --> 00:54:35,097
Whatcha reading?

828
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:37,766
What's she saying?

829
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:40,068
Wants to know what you're reading.

830
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:43,081
lt's Yeats. Keep your head back.

831
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,648
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her?

832
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,852
Show her what a treat that is.

833
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,120
When the hell they going to get to her?

834
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:53,890
l'm okay, Frankie.

835
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:56,591
What'd you learn tonight?

836
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:58,296
Always protect myself.

837
00:54:58,497 --> 00:54:59,464
What's the rule?

838
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:01,462
Always protect myself.

839
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,656
-Margaret Fitzgerald?

840
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:03,769
-Here!

841
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,232
l'll be right here.

842
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:22,988
How you doing?

843
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:24,585
-Me?

844
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:25,246
-Yeah, you.

845
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,756
l'm not the one who's hurt.

846
00:55:31,564 --> 00:55:33,361
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

847
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,762
Why are you telling me that?

848
00:55:38,537 --> 00:55:39,504
No reason.

849
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,338
But some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone.

850
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:48,511
And no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.

851
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:50,705
Did you write your daughter?

852
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,076
Every week.

853
00:55:54,186 --> 00:55:56,313
l've no idea why you come to church.

854
00:56:28,354 --> 00:56:30,515
After her 12th straight knockout,

855
00:56:30,656 --> 00:56:32,556
Frankie got a couple real good offers.

856
00:56:35,694 --> 00:56:38,288
The first was to fight Billie ''The Blue Bear'' Osterman...

857
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,660
...for the WBA welterweight title.

858
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:47,797
Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin.

859
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,066
Had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

860
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:14,021
Didn't seem to matter to her that something like that could kill a person.

861
00:57:15,534 --> 00:57:17,434
And the crowds loved her.

862
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:23,070
He turned it down without even telling her.

863
00:57:23,976 --> 00:57:26,240
The next was to fight the British champ,

864
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,242
a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.

865
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,278
Hello?

866
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:31,412
Not interested.

867
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:37,287
He turned that down, too.

868
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,649
That's a lot of money, boss.

869
00:57:42,828 --> 00:57:45,160
Yeah. You're making money. What are you still working here for?

870
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:47,755
lt's a title match, right?

871
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:51,295
Are you British? lt's a title you can't take away.

872
00:57:51,437 --> 00:57:53,564
She's got nothing to lose. You got nothing to win.

873
00:57:55,407 --> 00:57:57,102
Might still be a good fight.

874
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:58,974
Yeah.

875
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:01,238
l just brought you up to welterweight.

876
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,407
Too good to fight these contenders,

877
00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:05,414
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

878
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:07,644
Didn't notice l was fighting any contenders.

879
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:12,222
You can get yourself another manager any time you want.

880
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:17,284
ln fact, if you'd learn to protect your face a little better...

881
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:18,919
...l wouldn't have to turn down this money.

882
00:58:22,434 --> 00:58:23,298
My face out there so much it's a

883
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:25,869
miracle l ain't been knocked out yet, boss.

884
00:58:56,301 --> 00:58:57,791
No, you can't work here anymore tonight.

885
00:58:58,737 --> 00:59:00,295
l made us a reservation.

886
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:04,475
You might want to shower.

887
00:59:25,964 --> 00:59:26,828
Here you go.

888
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:29,100
Here you go.

889
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:31,593
What's this?

890
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:34,770
lt ain't no big secret what you're wishing for.

891
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,141
Go on and blow.

892
00:59:42,714 --> 00:59:43,578
Thank you.

893
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:50,250
33 ain't so old.

894
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:53,921
l was still fighting at 39.

895
00:59:55,828 --> 00:59:57,887
Fought for 23 years.

896
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:03,193
How's it going, Scrap?

897
01:00:03,902 --> 01:00:05,301
Doing good, Mickey.

898
01:00:06,705 --> 01:00:07,763
Doing good.

899
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:10,706
-What will you have?

900
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:11,776
-Coffee.

901
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,349
You two not speaking?

902
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,018
Don't hardly know him.

903
01:00:27,826 --> 01:00:31,353
l met Frankie right after my 37th birthday.

904
01:00:32,998 --> 01:00:34,932
He was picking up cut work.

905
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:39,535
He used to patch me up when l thought it was impossible.

906
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,541
Good man to have in your corner.

907
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,704
Yes, he is.

908
01:00:47,913 --> 01:00:51,076
He stayed with me through my last fight in San Berdu.

909
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:54,747
My manager was off getting drunk somewhere...

910
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:58,851
...and it was just Frankie and me.

911
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,553
l was taking a hellacious beating.

912
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:08,427
Everybody's got a particular number of fights in them.

913
01:01:09,635 --> 01:01:12,297
Nobody tells you what that number is.

914
01:01:13,605 --> 01:01:15,436
Mine was a 109.

915
01:01:16,808 --> 01:01:18,639
l just didn't want to admit it.

916
01:01:21,013 --> 01:01:22,480
Fourth round...

917
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:25,179
...this cut opens up.

918
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:27,842
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

919
01:01:30,455 --> 01:01:32,355
They should've stopped the fight, but, hell...

920
01:01:32,491 --> 01:01:36,484
l was a black man in San Berdu, blood was what l was there for.

921
01:01:37,763 --> 01:01:41,699
Round after round, l kept getting Frankie to patch me up.

922
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,027
He's talking about throwing in the towel...

923
01:01:44,169 --> 01:01:46,797
...but he ain't my manager, he can't throw in nothing.

924
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:50,070
Round after round...

925
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:52,275
...he's arguing with me.

926
01:01:54,546 --> 01:01:55,979
l'm almost laughing because, hell,

927
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,309
it's getting more to him than to me.

928
01:01:59,651 --> 01:02:01,414
l go 15 rounds...

929
01:02:02,254 --> 01:02:04,814
...lose by decision.

930
01:02:05,424 --> 01:02:07,585
Next morning, l lose the eye.

931
01:02:09,995 --> 01:02:12,987
ln 23 years, he's never said a thing about it.

932
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:15,422
Doesn't have to.

933
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:17,762
l can see it in his face every time he looks at me.

934
01:02:19,438 --> 01:02:24,307
Somehow Frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight...

935
01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:27,138
...should've saved my eye.

936
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:34,151
Spends his life wishing he could take th back that 109 fight.

937
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:37,647
l wanted to go to 1 10.

938
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,714
Thing is...

939
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,228
...if you want to get to the title...

940
01:02:44,496 --> 01:02:47,090
...maybe he's not the one to take you there.

941
01:02:52,537 --> 01:02:54,767
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

942
01:02:57,743 --> 01:02:59,210
Eat your cupcake.

943
01:03:00,245 --> 01:03:02,110
No, l got it.

944
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,646
l's the rule.

945
01:03:09,988 --> 01:03:11,751
Always protect yourself.

946
01:03:12,924 --> 01:03:15,256
People never take their own advice.

947
01:03:15,927 --> 01:03:18,191
lf she was going to leave Frankie,

948
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:21,057
better she did it to him then.

949
01:03:25,404 --> 01:03:28,805
Mr. Mickey Mack? l'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

950
01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:33,341
l hear you're a real good manager.

951
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:35,446
Doing good things for Big Willie.

952
01:03:36,214 --> 01:03:39,751
But l thought you should know l ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

953
01:03:40,285 --> 01:03:43,550
so you don't need to make any more excuses to bump into me.

954
01:03:45,223 --> 01:03:47,020
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

955
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:54,830
Maggie always did like taking them out in the first round.

956
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:32,426
The letters always came back marked the same way...

957
01:04:33,004 --> 01:04:34,938
...''Return to Sender.''

958
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:06,330
l will make you some coffee.

959
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:10,606
What are you doing with your money?

960
01:05:11,276 --> 01:05:12,334
Saving it.

961
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:13,409
Good girl.

962
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,707
You save enough of it, you ought to get yourself a little house.

963
01:05:18,817 --> 01:05:20,375
Cash, no mortgage.

964
01:05:20,485 --> 01:05:22,510
lt'll be a while before l can do that.

965
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:29,052
lt might be a stretch, but you got to

966
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:31,692
get yourself a place of your own.

967
01:05:32,197 --> 01:05:35,628
Go around wasting it on things that don't matter and what do you got?

968
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,366
You understand?

969
01:05:37,569 --> 01:05:40,966
Pretty soon, you wait long enough, you got nothing.

970
01:05:41,907 --> 01:05:43,704
Okay, soon as l get the money.

971
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:45,604
l made a lot of mistakes in my life.

972
01:05:45,744 --> 01:05:47,803
l'm trying to keep you from doing the same.

973
01:05:48,346 --> 01:05:49,745
l know, boss.

974
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:52,944
l'm not going to live forever.

975
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:53,743
What is it?

976
01:05:53,885 --> 01:05:56,353
A tape on that girl in England you'll fight.

977
01:05:56,788 --> 01:05:59,581
lf you're going to go for the title, we got some moves to--

978
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:02,658
Get the hell down. You know how old l am?

979
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:06,156
Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.

980
01:06:06,364 --> 01:06:10,323
You're welcome, darling. Now let me put this in the machine.

981
01:06:10,535 --> 01:06:11,559
What machine?

982
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:14,432
Don't have a TV, huh?

983
01:06:14,706 --> 01:06:15,730
No.

984
01:06:17,075 --> 01:06:18,372
Yeah!

985
01:06:19,544 --> 01:06:20,476
All right. Okay.

986
01:06:28,353 --> 01:06:29,081
Ten minutes, luv.

987
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,188
Thank you.

988
01:06:31,256 --> 01:06:32,553
Man says he loves me.

989
01:06:32,757 --> 01:06:34,816
He's probably not the first one to say that.

990
01:06:34,993 --> 01:06:36,290
First since my daddy.

991
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:39,592
l win, you think he'll propose?

992
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:41,526
You win, l'll propose.

993
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:47,696
l've got you a gift here.

994
01:06:53,211 --> 01:06:54,701
l think they gave you somebody else's.

995
01:06:54,913 --> 01:06:57,040
No. This is it.

996
01:06:57,949 --> 01:06:58,847
What does it mean?

997
01:06:59,551 --> 01:07:02,645
l don't know. lt's something in Gaelic.

998
01:07:04,422 --> 01:07:05,411
lt's beautiful.

999
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:07,816
l thought so.

1000
01:07:08,226 --> 01:07:09,818
Real silk thread.

1001
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:16,328
From the United States of America, the challenger...

1002
01:07:16,468 --> 01:07:20,461
...Maggie Fitzgerald!

1003
01:07:23,174 --> 01:07:25,438
Mo Cuishle.

1004
01:07:25,577 --> 01:07:29,240
Did you see what was on her robe? Yeah, Mo Cuishle. Mo Cuishle!

1005
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:33,917
She wasn't the main attraction.

1006
01:07:34,085 --> 01:07:36,986
She was on the undercard of a middleweight title fight.

1007
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:40,048
But ask someone who was there...

1008
01:07:40,258 --> 01:07:42,886
they couldn't tell you who else fought that night.

1009
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:50,533
Box!

1010
01:08:12,157 --> 01:08:13,249
MoGuishle!

1011
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:25,660
Mo Cuishle! Mo Cuishle!

1012
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:37,779
She's tough.

1013
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:42,851
l can't get inside. l can't get close enough to hit her.

1014
01:08:42,887 --> 01:08:43,615
-You know why that is?

1015
01:08:43,755 --> 01:08:44,653
-Why?

1016
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,621
She's a better fighter than you are.

1017
01:08:47,826 --> 01:08:50,761
She's younger, she's stronger, and she's more experienced.

1018
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:53,858
Now, what are you going to do about it?

1019
01:09:02,374 --> 01:09:03,102
Get in there.

1020
01:09:04,876 --> 01:09:05,604
Box!

1021
01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:24,285
...four, five, six...

1022
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:28,765
...seven, eight, nine, ten!

1023
01:09:41,846 --> 01:09:43,040
Mo Cuishle!

1024
01:09:43,415 --> 01:09:45,110
Mo Cuishle!

1025
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,987
l could ask someone, you know?

1026
01:09:54,826 --> 01:09:55,793
Good.

1027
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:58,157
You find out, you let me know.

1028
01:10:05,737 --> 01:10:08,399
Whatever it meant, the name stuck.

1029
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,940
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,

1030
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:12,771
Brussels and Amsterdam.

1031
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:15,539
lt was always ''Mo cuishle''.

1032
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:18,713
Seems there're lrish people everywhere,

1033
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,918
or people who want to be.

1034
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:23,985
By the time they came back to the States...

1035
01:10:24,856 --> 01:10:27,381
Maggie was in a whole new league.

1036
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:52,777
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1037
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:02,421
After that they got another offer to fight for the title.

1038
01:11:05,063 --> 01:11:06,189
What's the split?

1039
01:11:07,532 --> 01:11:08,590
60-40.

1040
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:09,631
Good.

1041
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:12,467
We'll take sixty and you take forty,

1042
01:11:12,604 --> 01:11:13,969
being as that Maggie's the draw.

1043
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:16,096
That little girl?

1044
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,168
You think l'm wrong, really?

1045
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:20,704
You think people are saying that...

1046
01:11:20,845 --> 01:11:23,507
they want to see some scabby Kraut beat up on little Miss What's-her-name?

1047
01:11:23,982 --> 01:11:26,610
You find someone who says that and we'll take the forty.

1048
01:11:34,559 --> 01:11:35,423
There you go.

1049
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,224
They're at 60-40,

1050
01:11:40,365 --> 01:11:42,060
but they'll come up to 50-50.

1051
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:44,998
How's that girl doing?

1052
01:11:45,503 --> 01:11:48,438
She's got a concussion and a broken eardrum.

1053
01:11:48,873 --> 01:11:50,067
She be all right?

1054
01:11:51,075 --> 01:11:52,440
And if she isn't?

1055
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:55,074
Maybe l should send her something?

1056
01:11:55,313 --> 01:11:56,974
Well, you could send her your check, if you'd like.

1057
01:11:57,115 --> 01:11:58,480
l'm sure she'd take it.

1058
01:12:04,088 --> 01:12:05,020
Boss?

1059
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:07,748
That little house we talked about?

1060
01:12:08,626 --> 01:12:09,718
l bought it.

1061
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:12,359
Well, smart girl.

1062
01:12:13,464 --> 01:12:14,658
For my mama.

1063
01:12:15,099 --> 01:12:17,124
lt's only about a mile from where she lives now.

1064
01:12:17,402 --> 01:12:19,336
No mortgage, just like you said.

1065
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,464
You're a good daughter.

1066
01:12:24,576 --> 01:12:26,043
She don't know about it yet.

1067
01:12:26,845 --> 01:12:29,245
l was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day,

1068
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,608
drive over there?

1069
01:12:30,782 --> 01:12:32,409
l know she wants to meet you.

1070
01:12:35,186 --> 01:12:37,279
Yeah. We could do that.

1071
01:12:54,973 --> 01:12:57,407
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

1072
01:12:58,076 --> 01:12:59,441
Mary M's here.

1073
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:19,257
This is the Johnson's old house.

1074
01:13:19,397 --> 01:13:20,659
Not anymore.

1075
01:13:25,203 --> 01:13:26,761
lt's all yours, Mama!

1076
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:28,872
For you and Mardell and the kids!

1077
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:30,663
Mary M, you bought this for me?

1078
01:13:30,808 --> 01:13:33,072
Yeah, all yours, free and clear!

1079
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:34,575
Darling....

1080
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:37,443
There's no fridge. No stove, neither.

1081
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:39,378
They'll be here before you move in.

1082
01:13:40,852 --> 01:13:41,819
-How much money did this cost you?

1083
01:13:41,953 --> 01:13:43,113
-You never mind that.

1084
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:44,614
-You shouldn't a done this.

1085
01:13:44,756 --> 01:13:46,348
-You need a decent place.

1086
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:49,752
You shouldn't a done it! You should've asked me first!

1087
01:13:51,162 --> 01:13:54,391
Government's gonna find out about this house, they'll stop my welfare.

1088
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:55,263
Mama, no, they ain't.

1089
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,595
They are. You're fine, you're working,

1090
01:13:57,735 --> 01:14:00,397
but l can't live without my welfare.

1091
01:14:00,672 --> 01:14:02,264
Mama, l send you money.

1092
01:14:02,507 --> 01:14:05,874
What about my medicine? Medicaid going to cut me off.

1093
01:14:06,077 --> 01:14:07,601
How am l supposed to get my medicine?

1094
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:09,446
l'll send you more money.

1095
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:12,311
Hope you don't expect J.D. to move in

1096
01:14:11,182 --> 01:14:13,810
here with us. He's getting out.

1097
01:14:14,452 --> 01:14:16,750
Why didn't you just give me the money?

1098
01:14:18,022 --> 01:14:20,149
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

1099
01:14:21,693 --> 01:14:23,058
Didn't have to, Mama.

1100
01:14:24,095 --> 01:14:25,323
But it's yours.

1101
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:28,629
You want the money, sell it.

1102
01:14:35,206 --> 01:14:36,298
l don't--

1103
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:45,244
l know you didn't mean nothing hurtful,

1104
01:14:45,383 --> 01:14:47,578
but you just don't think things through.

1105
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:48,986
That's true, Mama.

1106
01:14:49,187 --> 01:14:50,848
l'll try and keep the house.

1107
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:53,654
l just worry about all those expenses.

1108
01:14:54,459 --> 01:14:56,051
l'll send you some more money.

1109
01:15:05,503 --> 01:15:06,663
That man hitting you?

1110
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,730
lt's from the fight.

1111
01:15:10,742 --> 01:15:13,606
l'm a fighter, Mama.

1112
01:15:14,245 --> 01:15:15,837
Find a man, Mary M.

1113
01:15:16,414 --> 01:15:17,608
Live proper.

1114
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:20,774
People hear about what you're doing and they laugh.

1115
01:15:21,452 --> 01:15:24,421
Hurts me to tell you, but they laugh at you.

1116
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,138
Hi.

1117
01:16:48,106 --> 01:16:49,300
You ever own a dog?

1118
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:51,367
Nope.

1119
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:56,107
Closest l ever came was a middleweight from Barstow.

1120
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:02,477
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1121
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:05,116
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1122
01:17:05,256 --> 01:17:09,056
he had to drag himself room to room by his front legs.

1123
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:12,922
Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing, watching him...

1124
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:15,589
scoot across the kitchen floor.

1125
01:17:16,601 --> 01:17:18,330
Daddy, he was so sick by then,

1126
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:20,096
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1127
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:23,205
But one morning he got up

1128
01:17:23,941 --> 01:17:25,374
and carried Axel to his rig...

1129
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,000
and the two of them went off into the woods,

1130
01:17:27,145 --> 01:17:28,737
singing and howling.

1131
01:17:30,615 --> 01:17:34,073
Wasn't till he got home that night, alone,

1132
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,149
that l saw the... shovel in the back of the truck.

1133
01:17:41,926 --> 01:17:44,224
Sure miss watching the two of them together.

1134
01:17:53,638 --> 01:17:55,401
l got nobody but you, Frankie.

1135
01:17:59,477 --> 01:18:00,705
Well, you've got me.

1136
01:18:03,848 --> 01:18:07,443
At least, that is, until we find you a good manager.

1137
01:18:16,027 --> 01:18:19,187
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1138
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:21,130
Yeah.

1139
01:18:22,533 --> 01:18:24,933
This place has the best lemon pie around.

1140
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,731
None of that canned filling crap.

1141
01:18:43,054 --> 01:18:45,147
Now l can die and go to heaven.

1142
01:18:50,695 --> 01:18:52,287
l used to come here with Daddy.

1143
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:56,096
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1144
01:18:56,567 --> 01:18:58,125
l got a little bit of savings.

1145
01:19:06,043 --> 01:19:07,533
That's fine. Fine, thanks.

1146
01:19:13,351 --> 01:19:15,148
What the hell's Danger looking at?

1147
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,751
Looks like another bottle of water.

1148
01:19:18,856 --> 01:19:20,414
Want to come to Vegas with us?

1149
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:23,691
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots.

1150
01:19:24,395 --> 01:19:26,260
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1151
01:19:26,464 --> 01:19:29,356
Well, she's got a title shot. The Blue Bear.

1152
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:32,027
Million dollars, split right down the center.

1153
01:19:32,203 --> 01:19:34,137
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1154
01:19:34,272 --> 01:19:35,739
l could use a good second.

1155
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,908
Can't find one, l thought l'd ask you.

1156
01:19:38,142 --> 01:19:39,803
Why the hell would l want to do that?

1157
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:43,171
Because you're a half-blind old fool

1158
01:19:43,314 --> 01:19:44,872
who never got there himself.

1159
01:19:45,016 --> 01:19:47,109
Thought you might like to feel what

1160
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,912
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1161
01:19:48,986 --> 01:19:50,920
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1162
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:54,417
No, you pick up somebody there in Vegas.

1163
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:57,658
Somebody with young hands.

1164
01:19:57,828 --> 01:20:00,755
You're not going to cry now, are you? l've already got one girl.

1165
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:04,496
No, l leave this place for one day...

1166
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:07,137
got any idea what it would look like when l come back?

1167
01:20:07,672 --> 01:20:09,401
Kind of like it looks right now.

1168
01:20:09,707 --> 01:20:10,765
Go to hell.

1169
01:20:12,943 --> 01:20:15,707
Tell Maggie don't come back without a belt.

1170
01:20:16,213 --> 01:20:17,145
Will do.

1171
01:20:22,019 --> 01:20:22,883
Mr. Scrap.

1172
01:20:24,055 --> 01:20:27,218
l got a question, but l feel real stupid asking it.

1173
01:20:27,358 --> 01:20:30,020
No such thing as a stupid question there, Danger.

1174
01:20:34,165 --> 01:20:37,601
How'd you get all the ice in here through this little tiny hole?

1175
01:20:38,269 --> 01:20:41,727
l been thinking on it. Can't figure it out.

1176
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,737
Why don't l show you, Danger?

1177
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:45,173
You could show me?

1178
01:20:45,309 --> 01:20:46,537
l think so.

1179
01:20:48,012 --> 01:20:52,077
Also, Mr. Scrap, l was kind of thinking l might be ready for a fight?

1180
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:53,081
You do, do you?

1181
01:20:56,754 --> 01:20:58,722
Well, l got the tickets. You ready?

1182
01:20:59,357 --> 01:21:00,324
We're flying?

1183
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,550
Would you rather drive?

1184
01:21:03,594 --> 01:21:04,720
You're asking me?

1185
01:21:05,996 --> 01:21:08,396
Would you rather fly or would you rather drive?

1186
01:21:09,967 --> 01:21:11,798
So l finally get to decide something?!

1187
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:13,266
That's what l'm saying.

1188
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:14,534
Fine.

1189
01:21:15,139 --> 01:21:16,663
Fly there, drive back.

1190
01:21:17,475 --> 01:21:19,500
That's the stupidest thing l've ever heard.

1191
01:21:19,643 --> 01:21:21,110
How are we going to do that?

1192
01:21:21,312 --> 01:21:22,336
You said it was up to me.

1193
01:21:33,057 --> 01:21:34,684
Give them hell there, Danger.

1194
01:21:35,559 --> 01:21:37,789
Hey, old school, the toilet's overflowing.

1195
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,968
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1196
01:21:47,538 --> 01:21:48,869
Jesus.

1197
01:21:49,774 --> 01:21:51,901
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1198
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:00,680
Dumb-ass.

1199
01:22:01,252 --> 01:22:03,413
-Come on, Danger!

1200
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:05,750
-Come on! Defense!

1201
01:22:05,923 --> 01:22:08,050
Could be sitting up at The Mirage,

1202
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:10,317
drinking mai tais...

1203
01:22:11,562 --> 01:22:13,029
looking at naked women.

1204
01:22:13,164 --> 01:22:15,894
Come on, Danger, put up your hands and fight.

1205
01:22:28,312 --> 01:22:32,178
Fight back! Come on! There you go, Danger,

1206
01:22:33,784 --> 01:22:35,183
there you go!

1207
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:48,865
Come on, now, Flip! What you doing? Let him go!

1208
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:51,593
l've gotcha now. Come on.

1209
01:22:53,904 --> 01:22:54,928
lt's all right.

1210
01:22:56,707 --> 01:22:58,265
We don't need no corner trainer!

1211
01:22:58,876 --> 01:23:00,036
How'd l do, Mr. Scrap?

1212
01:23:00,177 --> 01:23:01,007
You did good, Danger.

1213
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:03,943
You my man. You rock.

1214
01:23:04,415 --> 01:23:06,508
Come on, Flip, man. You ain't done.

1215
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,311
You ain't even fight good yet.

1216
01:23:09,553 --> 01:23:11,214
Anybody can lose one fight, son.

1217
01:23:11,355 --> 01:23:12,686
You'll come back from this,

1218
01:23:12,823 --> 01:23:14,757
you'll be champion of the world.

1219
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,550
No, l won't, Mr. Scrap.

1220
01:23:19,196 --> 01:23:20,720
l should've knowed.

1221
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:22,890
Let's go, man, we don't need this honky.

1222
01:23:23,033 --> 01:23:23,829
-Let me help you.

1223
01:23:23,968 --> 01:23:25,663
-Naw, l can do her.

1224
01:23:25,803 --> 01:23:27,771
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1225
01:23:30,975 --> 01:23:34,234
Don't take the gloves off, man. You ain't even used them, Danger.

1226
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,540
Mind if l borrow these, Danger?

1227
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:42,145
Man, l thought your name was Danger?

1228
01:23:42,353 --> 01:23:43,786
Come on, now.

1229
01:23:44,388 --> 01:23:47,915
l see. Now l get to fight a retard and a old man.

1230
01:23:48,592 --> 01:23:51,652
Call ESPN, 'cause you can't write this shit!

1231
01:24:16,687 --> 01:24:18,120
1 10.

1232
01:24:23,294 --> 01:24:24,921
Get a job, punk.

1233
01:24:56,594 --> 01:24:59,154
Win this one and l'll tell you what it means.

1234
01:25:00,664 --> 01:25:02,029
l got you some pipers.

1235
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:24,586
Mo Cuishle! Mo Cuishle! Mo Cuishle!

1236
01:26:24,748 --> 01:26:27,148
l want you to jab her right in the tits,

1237
01:26:27,284 --> 01:26:29,047
until they turn blue and fall off.

1238
01:26:45,736 --> 01:26:51,299
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the feature presentation of the evening.

1239
01:26:51,442 --> 01:26:58,245
ln this corner, the challenger, Maggie Fitzgerald...

1240
01:26:56,714 --> 01:27:00,708
...in the red corner. ln the blue corner,

1241
01:27:00,851 --> 01:27:03,115
the WBA Welterweight champion

1242
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:04,982
of the world...

1243
01:27:05,122 --> 01:27:07,488
...Billie ''The Blue Bear''.

1244
01:27:10,761 --> 01:27:12,228
Sweet Jesus.

1245
01:27:28,345 --> 01:27:31,841
Fitzgerald is pushing the Blue Bear around the ring, coming on strong.

1246
01:27:34,985 --> 01:27:37,818
Challenger darts in, lands a combination to the head and the body.

1247
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:39,786
And a right hook stuns the champ!

1248
01:27:42,092 --> 01:27:42,990
Break it up!

1249
01:27:46,463 --> 01:27:47,487
Break it!

1250
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:57,565
Do that one more time, it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1251
01:27:59,409 --> 01:28:00,273
Go fight.

1252
01:28:08,619 --> 01:28:10,678
You motherfucker.

1253
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:20,927
Come on! What the fuck is that?

1254
01:28:21,265 --> 01:28:23,995
That's it. l'm going to take away a point.

1255
01:28:24,134 --> 01:28:25,931
One point deduction off the blue corner.

1256
01:28:29,573 --> 01:28:31,473
Ref, open your eyes!

1257
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:53,060
Ladies and gentlemen, the first round is in the books on this championship match.

1258
01:29:03,373 --> 01:29:03,998
Looking good.

1259
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:07,702
You pull that crap one more time, you're disqualified.

1260
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:18,115
lt's going to be all right.

1261
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:19,587
Got no doubt, boss.

1262
01:29:23,594 --> 01:29:27,086
You just watch yourself. Stay away from this dame.

1263
01:29:27,231 --> 01:29:28,163
Go on.

1264
01:29:39,142 --> 01:29:41,303
Go to the neutral corner! Neutral corner!

1265
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,404
4, 5, 6...

1266
01:29:44,548 --> 01:29:45,776
Stay down, bitch.

1267
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:49,682
...7, 8, 9....

1268
01:30:04,902 --> 01:30:05,834
Break it up!

1269
01:30:05,969 --> 01:30:07,095
Break it!

1270
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:18,711
Fitzgerald continues to pummel the Blue Bear, the East German Champion....

1271
01:30:31,695 --> 01:30:33,162
Yeah, baby, you got her!

1272
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:34,998
l got it.

1273
01:30:42,139 --> 01:30:43,470
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1274
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,335
How many eyes you need to finish this?

1275
01:30:45,509 --> 01:30:46,476
One's enough.

1276
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,278
Now, what do l do about the Bear?

1277
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:56,148
Do you know that step into the outside and hook into the liver?

1278
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,947
l been doing that. She's made of steel.

1279
01:30:58,221 --> 01:30:59,916
Don't go to the liver this time,

1280
01:31:00,057 --> 01:31:02,184
hit her right up under her skinny ass.

1281
01:31:02,326 --> 01:31:03,452
Right in the sciatic nerve.

1282
01:31:03,593 --> 01:31:05,993
Just keep digging it in there, digging it in.

1283
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:08,757
Keep sticking her. You hear that?

1284
01:31:08,966 --> 01:31:09,864
What about the Ref?

1285
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,367
Keep yourself between the Ref and the Bear and everything will be fine.

1286
01:31:15,973 --> 01:31:19,101
This is you. You keep it going. You keep it up.

1287
01:31:45,702 --> 01:31:46,726
Break!

1288
01:32:27,677 --> 01:32:29,076
Get the doctor!

1289
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,288
Come on. Breathe.

1290
01:32:47,197 --> 01:32:49,222
That's it. Breathe.

1291
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,365
Good.

1292
01:32:51,968 --> 01:32:54,095
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1293
01:32:54,237 --> 01:32:56,728
Breathe. Good.

1294
01:32:57,874 --> 01:32:59,034
That's it.

1295
01:33:00,777 --> 01:33:02,642
Breathe. Good.

1296
01:33:50,393 --> 01:33:51,826
How you feeling, darling?

1297
01:34:00,837 --> 01:34:02,805
Growing a beard, boss?

1298
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:06,504
Yeah, l thought it might help me with the ladies.

1299
01:34:08,578 --> 01:34:10,637
Can't say it does.

1300
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,835
Does it hurt much?

1301
01:34:42,412 --> 01:34:44,403
Don't hurt at all.

1302
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,742
Well, that's good.

1303
01:34:53,857 --> 01:34:55,381
Where's Frankie?

1304
01:34:57,761 --> 01:35:00,924
Well, he's out there talking to the doctors.

1305
01:35:01,765 --> 01:35:04,359
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1306
01:35:07,137 --> 01:35:10,868
They're telling him l'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1307
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:18,977
Means that my spinal cord's so broke they'll never be able to fix it.

1308
01:35:23,053 --> 01:35:26,284
Going to be frozen like this the rest of my life.

1309
01:35:31,661 --> 01:35:33,595
l asked them to tell him.

1310
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:35,994
l don't know how he's going to take it.

1311
01:35:43,907 --> 01:35:45,704
Did you see the fight?

1312
01:35:47,844 --> 01:35:49,573
Course l did.

1313
01:35:51,214 --> 01:35:53,079
You had her cold, Maggie.

1314
01:35:54,784 --> 01:35:57,514
l shouldn't a dropped my hands.

1315
01:36:01,658 --> 01:36:03,626
l shouldn't a turned.

1316
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:14,133
Always protect myself,

1317
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:16,205
how many times he tell me that?

1318
01:36:17,107 --> 01:36:18,199
Yeah.

1319
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:21,543
Does like to repeat himself.

1320
01:36:25,582 --> 01:36:28,483
Will you tell him l'm real sorry?

1321
01:36:33,023 --> 01:36:33,921
No.

1322
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:37,149
l won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1323
01:36:57,547 --> 01:36:58,673
Damnedest thing.

1324
01:37:02,952 --> 01:37:04,442
So, what's the plan?

1325
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:08,749
l know you got one, so you might as well tell me what it is.

1326
01:37:09,059 --> 01:37:10,583
lt's your fault.

1327
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:14,194
Yeah, it's your fault she's lying in there like that.

1328
01:37:14,597 --> 01:37:16,724
You kept after me until l trained her.

1329
01:37:17,033 --> 01:37:19,934
l knew l shouldn't have done it. Her being a girl and all.

1330
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:24,738
Everything kept telling me not to. Everything but you.

1331
01:37:35,952 --> 01:37:37,249
l'm going to get you out of here.

1332
01:37:37,554 --> 01:37:39,522
These doctors around here don't know squat.

1333
01:37:39,656 --> 01:37:42,216
Otherwise why would they be living out here in the desert?

1334
01:37:43,693 --> 01:37:45,558
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1335
01:37:46,029 --> 01:37:49,130
we'll find someplace where they've actually studied medicine.

1336
01:37:52,802 --> 01:37:54,997
You just rest there.

1337
01:37:56,539 --> 01:37:58,769
l'm on it.

1338
01:38:07,217 --> 01:38:09,549
Frankie must've called every hospital in America...

1339
01:38:09,686 --> 01:38:12,577
...looking for somebody who'd tell him they could fix her.

1340
01:38:12,655 --> 01:38:17,092
He came close twice till they checked her over...

1341
01:38:17,227 --> 01:38:18,888
...said there was nothing to be done.

1342
01:38:19,629 --> 01:38:22,496
Took two months till she was stable enough to move.

1343
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:30,536
They got nurses for that, you know.

1344
01:38:32,308 --> 01:38:34,742
Yeah, they're amateurs.

1345
01:38:46,556 --> 01:38:47,955
She developed skin ulcers because she

1346
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:49,991
couldn't change positions.

1347
01:39:01,905 --> 01:39:03,031
Thank you.

1348
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:16,317
They made the six-hour trip by ambulance.

1349
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:30,722
Fly there, drive back.

1350
01:39:37,073 --> 01:39:40,474
The rehab center Frankie found was a nice place.

1351
01:39:41,211 --> 01:39:43,202
They took good care of Maggie.

1352
01:39:43,379 --> 01:39:45,643
She wouldn't have complained if they hadn't.

1353
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:48,141
Took several hours every day to get her ready

1354
01:39:48,284 --> 01:39:50,184
for the wheelchair.

1355
01:39:55,892 --> 01:39:57,860
One, two, three.

1356
01:40:00,697 --> 01:40:02,722
Since she couldn't breathe on her own,

1357
01:40:02,966 --> 01:40:05,366
her respirators were always on.

1358
01:40:06,769 --> 01:40:10,364
Oxygen was pumped into her 24 hours a day.

1359
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:38,425
Maggie's mama called to say

1360
01:40:38,568 --> 01:40:40,365
they were all coming for a visit.

1361
01:40:40,537 --> 01:40:43,802
She waited by the window every day for the next two weeks.

1362
01:40:46,509 --> 01:40:48,841
Frankie finally tracked them down...

1363
01:40:49,312 --> 01:40:52,748
...learned they'd checked into their hotel six days earlier.

1364
01:40:53,383 --> 01:40:56,250
Kept leaving messages, which were never returned.

1365
01:41:01,024 --> 01:41:03,390
You don't have to hang around all day.

1366
01:41:07,497 --> 01:41:10,057
l like it here. l don't mind.

1367
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,189
Fact, if you weren't here,

1368
01:41:12,335 --> 01:41:14,428
l'd come here anyway To read my books.

1369
01:41:18,007 --> 01:41:20,908
Mama will be here soon, share some of the burden.

1370
01:41:21,311 --> 01:41:22,778
Well, it's no burden.

1371
01:41:24,047 --> 01:41:24,945
Here...

1372
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:28,617
...read this.

1373
01:41:38,194 --> 01:41:40,025
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1374
01:41:40,563 --> 01:41:41,723
That's terrible.

1375
01:41:44,467 --> 01:41:47,061
Anyway, l'll tell you in English what you were saying.

1376
01:41:50,473 --> 01:41:51,531
lt says:

1377
01:41:51,975 --> 01:41:55,376
''l will arise and go now, and go to lnnisfree.

1378
01:41:55,712 --> 01:41:57,839
And a small cabin build there,

1379
01:41:57,981 --> 01:42:00,381
of clay and wattles made.

1380
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:03,482
And l shall have some peace there,

1381
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:05,850
for peace comes dropping slow.

1382
01:42:06,189 --> 01:42:10,683
Dropping from the veils of the morning, to where the cricket sings.''

1383
01:42:13,296 --> 01:42:14,558
Not bad, huh?

1384
01:42:19,168 --> 01:42:21,636
You going to build a cabin, boss?

1385
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:23,131
Me?

1386
01:42:26,342 --> 01:42:28,469
You know, when you quit all this.

1387
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,242
You mean boxing?

1388
01:42:33,082 --> 01:42:35,277
No. l'll never quit.

1389
01:42:36,953 --> 01:42:39,183
Like the stink too much, l guess.

1390
01:42:45,061 --> 01:42:47,689
You think? l could see you there,

1391
01:42:46,763 --> 01:42:49,889
real easy, with your books and lemon pie.

1392
01:42:52,402 --> 01:42:54,802
How about you? Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1393
01:42:57,306 --> 01:42:59,365
l could learn how to bake.

1394
01:43:03,613 --> 01:43:06,776
Well, then, maybe l'll start looking.

1395
01:43:29,138 --> 01:43:30,264
Yeah?

1396
01:43:39,849 --> 01:43:42,079
l'm Frankie Dunn. l met you back out in Missouri.

1397
01:43:42,218 --> 01:43:43,651
Where's my little girl?

1398
01:43:43,886 --> 01:43:46,480
Don't you think you ought to go back to the hotel and change?

1399
01:43:46,622 --> 01:43:49,352
She doesn't know you've been here a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1400
01:43:49,559 --> 01:43:51,356
We got business with my sister.

1401
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:53,028
Why don't you just tell us where she is?

1402
01:43:53,162 --> 01:43:56,325
You must be J.D. and you must be the business guy?

1403
01:43:56,466 --> 01:43:57,933
There's some rides you missed.

1404
01:43:58,067 --> 01:44:00,092
Go on back, l'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1405
01:44:00,236 --> 01:44:02,670
l drove all the way here to take care of my child...

1406
01:44:02,805 --> 01:44:04,796
... and you're suggesting l'm not a good mother?

1407
01:44:05,341 --> 01:44:07,036
Mary M can't go nowhere if we could

1408
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:10,143
have taken her to Disneyl and we would have.

1409
01:44:11,848 --> 01:44:13,179
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1410
01:44:13,516 --> 01:44:15,177
Right down here. 301 .

1411
01:44:15,318 --> 01:44:15,875
-Come on, Mama.

1412
01:44:16,018 --> 01:44:17,315
-Let's go.

1413
01:44:23,693 --> 01:44:28,630
l saw myself breathing! My body was going up and down.

1414
01:44:29,432 --> 01:44:31,332
l thought, ''Why didn't somebody tell me?!''

1415
01:44:34,137 --> 01:44:37,595
Your hair needs washing. lt's kinda greasy.

1416
01:44:51,154 --> 01:44:55,750
lt's just some kind of legal thing.

1417
01:44:56,058 --> 01:44:57,286
What is it?

1418
01:44:57,493 --> 01:44:59,085
How we all doing here?

1419
01:44:59,529 --> 01:45:02,225
Sorry, darling, but we ain't got a lotta time.

1420
01:45:02,431 --> 01:45:06,663
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1421
01:45:06,803 --> 01:45:09,271
Leave that and l'll read it to her later.

1422
01:45:09,405 --> 01:45:10,599
Hey, old man...

1423
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:12,635
...you part of our family?

1424
01:45:13,543 --> 01:45:15,238
Stay the hell out of this.

1425
01:45:16,913 --> 01:45:18,608
Read it to me, Mama.

1426
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,247
lt's just something legal...

1427
01:45:20,383 --> 01:45:21,782
...to protect your money.

1428
01:45:23,252 --> 01:45:24,810
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1429
01:45:25,388 --> 01:45:28,619
The Boxing Commission's paying for all this. Everything.

1430
01:45:29,058 --> 01:45:31,219
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1431
01:45:31,527 --> 01:45:34,018
Mr. Johnson says they can take my house.

1432
01:45:34,197 --> 01:45:37,557
lf you assign your assets to your mother, no one will be able to touch them.

1433
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,230
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1434
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:41,696
Nothing.

1435
01:45:41,838 --> 01:45:44,933
Why don't you just leave it and then l'll just read it to her later on-

1436
01:45:44,807 --> 01:45:47,435
Mr. Dunn, with respect, this isn't your business.

1437
01:45:49,078 --> 01:45:51,444
All right. l'll be out in the hall.

1438
01:45:57,687 --> 01:45:59,882
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1439
01:46:01,691 --> 01:46:03,420
You sign that paper,

1440
01:46:03,793 --> 01:46:05,727
it'll take care of your family...

1441
01:46:06,295 --> 01:46:08,729
...the way your daddy would have wanted you to.

1442
01:46:13,236 --> 01:46:15,204
How do you make your mark?

1443
01:46:17,773 --> 01:46:19,070
Can you hold a pen?

1444
01:46:19,208 --> 01:46:21,301
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1445
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:23,474
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1446
01:46:25,314 --> 01:46:26,679
Here you go, honey.

1447
01:46:30,086 --> 01:46:31,781
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1448
01:46:32,455 --> 01:46:34,548
Honey, you know how l feel about that.

1449
01:46:35,992 --> 01:46:37,516
l did pretty good.

1450
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,423
You lost, Mary M.

1451
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:44,056
Ain't your fault, the way l heard it, but you lost.

1452
01:46:45,968 --> 01:46:48,664
Don't want to lose the rest of what you got left.

1453
01:46:49,705 --> 01:46:50,603
There you go.

1454
01:46:59,982 --> 01:47:02,177
What happened to you?

1455
01:47:02,318 --> 01:47:03,808
What's that supposed to mean?

1456
01:47:05,855 --> 01:47:09,086
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D. and get home.

1457
01:47:11,027 --> 01:47:12,654
Before l tell that lawyer there that

1458
01:47:12,795 --> 01:47:15,059
you were so worried about your welfare...

1459
01:47:15,197 --> 01:47:17,597
...you never signed those house papers like you were supposed to.

1460
01:47:20,469 --> 01:47:21,993
So, any time l feel like it...

1461
01:47:22,138 --> 01:47:24,971
...l can sell that house from under

1462
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:26,574
your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.

1463
01:47:28,444 --> 01:47:32,107
And if you ever come back, that's exactly what l'll do.

1464
01:48:13,255 --> 01:48:17,055
Well, maybe someone ought to count to ten.

1465
01:48:31,007 --> 01:48:33,567
Don't smell real pretty, does it, Doc?

1466
01:48:35,811 --> 01:48:37,574
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1467
01:49:54,557 --> 01:49:56,787
They took my leg, boss.

1468
01:50:02,231 --> 01:50:04,722
lt's gonna be all right. You hear?

1469
01:50:05,668 --> 01:50:08,432
l always hear your voice, boss.

1470
01:50:40,636 --> 01:50:41,967
You need anything?

1471
01:50:46,175 --> 01:50:48,769
l need to know what Mo Cuishle means.

1472
01:50:50,513 --> 01:50:54,973
Well, you didn't win. l don't have to tell you.

1473
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:00,980
You're the meanest man l ever met,

1474
01:51:01,257 --> 01:51:03,020
no wonder no one loves you.

1475
01:51:07,096 --> 01:51:09,155
You remind me of my daddy.

1476
01:51:12,168 --> 01:51:17,731
Well, he must have been a very intelligent, handsome man.

1477
01:51:21,744 --> 01:51:24,508
You ain't gonna make me talk no more Yeats, are you?

1478
01:51:26,749 --> 01:51:27,841
No, l was...

1479
01:51:29,752 --> 01:51:32,414
...looking at this catalog from City College.

1480
01:51:34,857 --> 01:51:37,553
l thought l'd get you a wheelchair...

1481
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:40,920
...maybe the kind that operates by blowing through a straw.

1482
01:51:41,931 --> 01:51:44,627
l thought maybe you'd like to go back to school.

1483
01:51:49,939 --> 01:51:51,964
l got a favor to ask you, boss.

1484
01:51:54,543 --> 01:51:55,532
Sure.

1485
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:59,111
Anything you want.

1486
01:52:01,517 --> 01:52:04,111
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1487
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:19,333
Don't even think about that.

1488
01:52:23,672 --> 01:52:25,765
l can't be like this, Frankie.

1489
01:52:29,311 --> 01:52:32,872
Not after what l've done. l seen the world.

1490
01:52:36,285 --> 01:52:38,378
People chanted my name.

1491
01:52:39,488 --> 01:52:45,888
Well...not my name, some damn name you gave me...

1492
01:52:49,298 --> 01:52:51,664
but they were chanting for me.

1493
01:52:55,271 --> 01:52:57,330
l was in magazines.

1494
01:53:01,143 --> 01:53:03,634
You think l ever dreamed that'd happen?

1495
01:53:08,484 --> 01:53:11,885
l was born at two pounds, one-and-a- half ounces.

1496
01:53:15,658 --> 01:53:18,650
Daddy used to tell me l fought to get into this world...

1497
01:53:22,398 --> 01:53:24,866
...and l'd fight my way out.

1498
01:53:29,772 --> 01:53:32,070
That's all l want to do, Frankie.

1499
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:37,470
l just don't want to fight you to do it.

1500
01:53:40,215 --> 01:53:42,240
l got what l needed.

1501
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:47,384
l got it all.

1502
01:53:51,694 --> 01:53:54,458
Don't let them keep taking it away from me.

1503
01:53:59,735 --> 01:54:01,669
Don't let me lie here till l can't hear

1504
01:54:01,804 --> 01:54:04,602
those people chanting no more.

1505
01:54:09,712 --> 01:54:11,043
l can't.

1506
01:54:12,614 --> 01:54:13,774
Please...

1507
01:54:16,752 --> 01:54:19,084
...please, don't ask me.

1508
01:54:21,423 --> 01:54:23,288
l'm asking.

1509
01:54:26,995 --> 01:54:28,485
l can't.

1510
01:55:12,841 --> 01:55:13,773
Hello?

1511
01:55:20,282 --> 01:55:24,616
ln the middle of the night, Maggie had found her own solution.

1512
01:55:26,088 --> 01:55:27,680
She had bit her tongue.

1513
01:55:35,564 --> 01:55:37,759
Stop. Stop.

1514
01:55:41,637 --> 01:55:44,037
Look at me. Look at me.

1515
01:55:58,687 --> 01:56:01,485
Nearly bled to death before they stitched her up.

1516
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:06,424
She came around and ripped them out before Frankie even got there.

1517
01:56:07,496 --> 01:56:09,464
They stitched her up again,

1518
01:56:09,765 --> 01:56:12,666
padded the tongue so she couldn't bite.

1519
01:56:31,386 --> 01:56:33,513
You can't do it, you know that.

1520
01:56:35,424 --> 01:56:36,789
l do, Father.

1521
01:56:38,494 --> 01:56:40,485
You don't know how thick she is,

1522
01:56:40,762 --> 01:56:42,457
how hard it was to train her.

1523
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:47,130
Other fighters would do exactly what you say to them and...

1524
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:50,137
...and she'd ask why this and why that

1525
01:56:50,272 --> 01:56:52,103
and do it her own way, anyway.

1526
01:56:53,809 --> 01:56:57,938
How she fought for the title, l... Wasn't by anything....

1527
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:00,448
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1528
01:57:09,925 --> 01:57:11,950
But now she wants to die,

1529
01:57:12,661 --> 01:57:14,754
and l just want to keep her with me.

1530
01:57:19,034 --> 01:57:21,002
And l swear to God, Father...

1531
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:26,107
it's committing a sin by doing it.

1532
01:57:26,742 --> 01:57:29,233
By keeping her alive, l'm killing her.

1533
01:57:30,846 --> 01:57:33,542
Do you know what l mean? How do l get around that?

1534
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:37,680
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1535
01:57:37,819 --> 01:57:39,650
You leave it with God.

1536
01:57:40,789 --> 01:57:42,586
She's not asking for God's help.

1537
01:57:42,724 --> 01:57:44,282
She's asking for mine.

1538
01:57:44,459 --> 01:57:45,483
Frankie, l've seen you at mass

1539
01:57:45,627 --> 01:57:48,061
almost every day for 23 years.

1540
01:57:48,463 --> 01:57:50,363
The only person comes to church that

1541
01:57:50,499 --> 01:57:52,330
much is the kind who can't forgive himself for something.

1542
01:57:52,467 --> 01:57:54,992
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1543
01:57:55,304 --> 01:57:57,397
...they're nothing compared to this.

1544
01:57:58,006 --> 01:58:01,533
Forget about God... or Heaven and Hell.

1545
01:58:02,377 --> 01:58:05,312
lf you do this thing, you'll be lost...

1546
01:58:08,884 --> 01:58:10,875
...somewhere so deep...

1547
01:58:12,988 --> 01:58:14,819
...you'll never find yourself again.

1548
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:24,455
l think l did it already.

1549
01:58:46,054 --> 01:58:48,420
We're keeping her sedated so she won't try that again.

1550
01:59:54,556 --> 01:59:56,490
l went to see Maggie this morning.

1551
01:59:59,061 --> 02:00:00,926
You must have been somewhere else.

1552
02:00:02,164 --> 02:00:03,324
Yeah.

1553
02:00:07,769 --> 02:00:09,737
You got a fight l don't know about?

1554
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:16,934
lt wasn't your fault.

1555
02:00:18,146 --> 02:00:19,875
l was wrong to say that.

1556
02:00:20,449 --> 02:00:21,780
You're damn right.

1557
02:00:23,685 --> 02:00:25,312
l found you a fighter...

1558
02:00:25,454 --> 02:00:28,116
...and you made her the best fighter she could be.

1559
02:00:31,693 --> 02:00:32,853
l killed her.

1560
02:00:32,994 --> 02:00:34,018
Don't say that.

1561
02:00:35,263 --> 02:00:37,959
Maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts...

1562
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:41,160
...no chance in the world of being what she needed to be.

1563
02:00:41,336 --> 02:00:42,633
A year and a half later, she's fighting

1564
02:00:42,771 --> 02:00:44,796
for the championship of the world.

1565
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:46,305
You did that.

1566
02:00:48,477 --> 02:00:50,411
People die every day, Frankie...

1567
02:00:51,046 --> 02:00:53,173
...mopping floors, washing dishes.

1568
02:00:53,381 --> 02:00:55,212
And you know what their last thought is?

1569
02:00:55,383 --> 02:00:57,078
l never got my shot.

1570
02:00:58,386 --> 02:01:00,854
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1571
02:01:02,057 --> 02:01:04,685
lf she dies today, you know what her last thought will be?

1572
02:01:06,461 --> 02:01:08,725
''l think l did all right.''

1573
02:01:16,438 --> 02:01:18,668
l know l could rest with that.

1574
02:01:23,378 --> 02:01:24,606
Yeah.

1575
02:01:36,091 --> 02:01:37,251
Yeah.

1576
02:02:16,231 --> 02:02:17,630
l'll get a cup of coffee.

1577
02:02:46,361 --> 02:02:47,225
All right.

1578
02:02:52,067 --> 02:02:54,331
l'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1579
02:02:55,403 --> 02:02:57,132
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1580
02:03:02,444 --> 02:03:04,708
Then l'll give you a shot and you'll...

1581
02:03:06,147 --> 02:03:07,842
...stay asleep.

1582
02:03:13,288 --> 02:03:14,653
MoCuishle Mo Cuishle...

1583
02:03:16,458 --> 02:03:20,121
...means ''my darling, my blood.''

1584
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:30,059
He gave her a single shot.

1585
02:04:31,266 --> 02:04:34,758
lt was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over.

1586
02:04:35,804 --> 02:04:38,432
He didn't want her going through this again.

1587
02:05:28,656 --> 02:05:30,453
Then he walked out.

1588
02:05:30,925 --> 02:05:33,485
l don't think he had anything left.

1589
02:05:52,847 --> 02:05:54,542
l went back to the gym.

1590
02:05:55,283 --> 02:05:58,514
Waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.

1591
02:06:18,673 --> 02:06:21,403
And that's when a ghost came through the door.

1592
02:06:24,612 --> 02:06:26,842
l got to thinking what you said, Mist' Scrap.

1593
02:06:28,583 --> 02:06:30,050
What was that, Danger?

1594
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,650
Anybody can lose one fight.

1595
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:37,089
That's the truth.

1596
02:06:38,359 --> 02:06:41,055
Put your gloves on. You missed a lot of training.

1597
02:06:43,031 --> 02:06:45,022
Will do, Mist' Scrap. Sure thing.

1598
02:07:04,319 --> 02:07:06,844
Frankie never came back at all.

1599
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:23,760
Frankie didn't leave a note,

1600
02:07:23,905 --> 02:07:25,805
and nobody knew where he went.

1601
02:07:26,674 --> 02:07:29,040
l'd hoped he'd gone to find you...

1602
02:07:29,377 --> 02:07:31,868
...and ask you one more time to forgive him.

1603
02:07:32,514 --> 02:07:35,711
But maybe he didn't have anything left in his heart.

1604
02:07:36,084 --> 02:07:38,018
l just hope he found someplace where he

1605
02:07:38,153 --> 02:07:39,882
could find a little peace.

1606
02:07:40,155 --> 02:07:42,715
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1607
02:07:43,424 --> 02:07:46,325
Somewhere between nowhere and good-bye.

1608
02:07:46,794 --> 02:07:49,558
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1609
02:07:50,899 --> 02:07:52,662
No matter where he is...

1610
02:07:53,401 --> 02:07:54,800
...l thought you should know what kind

1611
02:07:54,936 --> 02:07:57,734
of man your father really was.
