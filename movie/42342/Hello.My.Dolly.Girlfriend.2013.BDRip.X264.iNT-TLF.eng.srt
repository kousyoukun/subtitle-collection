00:01:54,279 --> 00:02:03,814
Hello, My Dolly Girlfriend

2
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,193
Listen, moron!

3
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:18,928
You work your ass off
but where's it get you?

4
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:26,308
We let you become an editor
like you wanted.

5
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:31,478
But none of your books sell!

6
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:33,212
lt's unacceptable.

7
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:40,815
Because of you
Editorial suite 3

8
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,559
is in jeopardy.

9
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,729
A decision will be
made by Management.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,492
"Morons shouldn't edit books."

11
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,967
That's what the Director said.

12
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:59,306
The profit from your books
wouldn't cover your salary.

13
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:05,682
You work 'till midnight but
it's to no benefit.

14
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,715
lt's a waste of electricity.

15
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:12,817
Doing nothing

16
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:17,758
would be better than making
unprofitable books.

17
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:18,829
But...

18
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,497
Those books

19
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,036
were proposed by clients
you couldn't refuse.

20
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:36,512
Are you blaming me?

21
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:40,315
They were good proposals
that you ruined

22
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,281
by not finding a market!

23
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:47,850
But l told you that
the proposals had no focus.

24
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,754
The guys in sales

25
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,630
want enticing books
for the bookshops.

26
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:00,962
Now they have a bad impression
of all our books.

27
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,699
Right, guys?

28
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,401
lt's not that bad.

29
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:09,939
But 70% of our last publication
didn't sell.

30
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:13,142
That is a concern.

31
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,179
lt affects all our products.

32
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,789
lt destroys the trust we've built up.

33
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:24,825
But if you took on these
books as a favour

34
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:28,055
Editorial 3 must
be held accountable.

35
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:33,032
lf you understood
you wouldn't say that.

36
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,473
lt's this guy who's useless.

37
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:40,305
You can't blame us for his error.

38
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:43,944
Uchiyama.

39
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:49,017
Your incompetence is dragging us
all down.

40
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:53,349
Cancel all further projects
immediately.

41
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:57,528
Apologize to the writers you've
lined up.

42
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:00,392
Manager.

43
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:04,291
Losses from the unsold books can
be recouped

44
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,031
with electronic sales.

45
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:12,170
Us editors are good at
troubleshooting.

46
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:16,106
As long as Uchiyama isn't involved.

47
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:20,217
Listen bastard!

48
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,822
You knew it wasn't going to sell.

49
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,517
And that the Manager
was getting a cut.

50
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,560
Now you're kissing his ass!

51
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,858
You're hopeless.

52
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,533
Why aren't you as sharp as him?

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,064
You ruin it for everybody!

54
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:44,874
You convinced me to do it and now
you're blaming me!

55
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,707
l worked my ass off!

56
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,175
Was it really my fault?

57
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:53,747
Who hired you anyway?

58
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:56,584
We're losing money on you.

59
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,449
Quit reading porn magazines.

60
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:04,193
Read some business motivation books,
for God sakes!

61
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:07,791
That's going too far!

62
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,340
Who do you think you are?

63
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:53,107
"Disciplinay memo for
Kentaro Uchiyama."

64
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,739
"Move to Equipment Management
next week."

65
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,043
What's this?

66
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,942
l wasn't consulted.

67
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:09,890
Manager.

68
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:15,824
l wasn't consulted about this.

69
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,159
Consulted?

70
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,836
lt's a company order.
You just obey.

71
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:27,911
l forgot to tell you because
l was so pissed!

72
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,677
Good luck in Equipment Management.

73
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,918
Make sure we don't run out of
office supplies.

74
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:41,956
While we ty to recover
the losses you made.

75
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,161
Go now.

76
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,558
Get out of here!

77
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,502
Don't stand there!

78
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,106
Move it!

79
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:03,878
"Hi, Hosoki, l'm in a fix."

80
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:09,543
"The manager was told off by
Senior Directors so he blamed me."

81
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:15,554
"He needed a scapegoat coz
he's got a family to feed."

82
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,086
"But why me?
It can't be all my fault!"

83
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,163
"What's going on?"

84
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,934
"l know you'll understand how l feel."

85
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:31,232
"l'll try not to complain
to you tonight."

86
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,811
"If l do, l'm sorry."

87
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,576
"What would l do without you, Baby?"

88
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,517
"You should quit."

89
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,913
"The company is trying
to make you leave."

90
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:49,392
"Have some pride
and quit before you're fired."

91
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,258
"Save your dignity."

92
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:56,099
"l wouldn't find another job
in this economy."

93
00:08:56,901 --> 00:09:00,769
"l don't have savings and
l don't want to leave you..."

94
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,231
Assholes!

95
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,908
Even a genius couldn't sell
those books!

96
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,922
We're all in this shit together!

97
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,592
They don't get it.

98
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,465
Those suckers.

99
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,864
Morons!

100
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,842
They think they're superior.

101
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,177
l'm home.

102
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,584
Bastards...

103
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,658
Where am l?

104
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:38,526
l'm...

105
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,867
home.

106
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,604
Bastards...

107
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,302
You get a cut, you thief!

108
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:55,208
l did eveything
while you did nothing!

109
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,402
Damn it!

110
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:29,310
Who are you to
tell me off?

111
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,067
Hi, darling Jody.

112
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,100
l only have you.

113
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,109
lf l didn't have you l'd be

114
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,112
nothing.

115
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,116
Good morning.

116
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,822
Hi, what's happening?

117
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:48,723
Ms. Kataoka ms promoted
from Sales.

118
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,767
We're helping her out.

119
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,666
Thank you, eveyone!

120
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,729
But this is my...

121
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,868
Yeah, so why don't you move your
stuff out for her?

122
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,346
She has work to do.

123
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,344
l'll do my best.

124
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,486
What about me...?

125
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,321
Trash that.

126
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:23,692
You read the memo.

127
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:27,170
You can quit...

128
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,664
lt's effective next week!

129
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:34,474
l have time to convince them
with my proposal.

130
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,379
lt'll stimulate sales.
Give me a chance!

131
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,285
l developed it
with a good writer.

132
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,816
l'm an editor.
Equipment isn't my thing...

133
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,191
Your career's short compared
to my 30 years.

134
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:56,063
lf you want to complain,
take it to the labour court!

135
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,064
l don't care.

136
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:02,165
What's wrong?

137
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,239
This isn't working...

138
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:16,249
Why only l get punished?

139
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:21,685
Up yours, you idiot?

140
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,251
You figured l was a pushover...

141
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,426
We have gorgeous girls!

142
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,498
You can look at their
pussies from below.

143
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,765
ldiots.

144
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,099
Bunch of morons!

145
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,944
She cancelled our hotel booking!

146
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,284
Now why would she do that?

147
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,417
l wanted to go.

148
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:58,596
Hey, Hosoki.

149
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,791
Let's go to a love hotel.

150
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,464
No? l want a suite
at a luxury hotel.

151
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,099
Good.

152
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,301
l'll book it.

153
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:21,552
What idiot thinks
l could afford a suite!

154
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,887
You're not classy enough
for a suite.

155
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,919
lt takes courage to
walk into a love hotel.

156
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:39,164
lt feels like you're being watched
even if you're not.

157
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,870
Hey, look at that couple.

158
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:50,345
They just went
into the love hotel.

159
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,844
l don't care about them.

160
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,628
You're fucking with me...

161
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,894
Don't fuck with me.

162
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,164
Show some respect!

163
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:36,050
l've done nothing wrong.
You know that.

164
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,119
l do!

165
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,829
They won't survive without you.

166
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,968
Stupid company!

167
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,467
They are clueless.

168
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:50,400
Oh, it's so big!

169
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,488
That's how it was meant to be.

170
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,747
lt's not to be.

171
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,752
Eveybody hates me.
Don't they?

172
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,557
You scared me!

173
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:17,601
Go home! Your mumbling
creeps me out.

174
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:20,270
l'm creepy...?

175
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:22,565
Don't say that!

176
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,037
What do you want?

177
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,274
Security!

178
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,849
Help!

179
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:33,378
Let me go!

180
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:38,687
Sir, you've had too much drink.

181
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,555
Come again!

182
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,771
ln your dreams, asshole!

183
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,807
l'll diss you on the Net.

184
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,275
Bastard!

185
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,985
You have a nerve
picking a fight with me!

186
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,318
Yoshi, ignore him.

187
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:20,190
l don't care if you're
Yoshi or yakuza.

188
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,465
You owe me an apology.

189
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,796
Leave him alone, Yoshi.

190
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,304
Come on, stop it. Let's go.

191
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:40,615
Forget it.

192
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:44,176
Yoshi, come on.

193
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,820
l want to go home.

194
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,619
Stay out of it.

195
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,425
Let's go, honey!

196
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,965
What's wrong with you?

197
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,436
Come on, get up!

198
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:14,115
Let's go! Please don't do this.

199
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,717
Shut up!

200
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,947
Son of a bitch!

201
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,452
Leave me alone!

202
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,226
Please don't!

203
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,822
lt's OK!

204
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,797
Whoops, excuse me!

205
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:52,421
Yoshi, please don't.

206
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:54,082
Where has he gone?

207
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,500
He's around here!

208
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:13,270
Let go of me!

209
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:16,608
You're covered with blood!
Let's go.

210
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,274
l'm fine! He's gone this way.

211
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,308
Where is he?

212
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,625
You need first aid.

213
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:35,089
Hiromi, look at that.

214
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,162
The open door.

215
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:39,797
Come on.

216
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:44,772
Wait for me!

217
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,587
That was close!

218
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,402
Was l here before?

219
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,645
lt's open...

220
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,382
"Dolphin Lounge"

221
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:49,488
"Pub Sachiko & Akkina"...?

222
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,197
ls anyone in there?

223
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:24,087
Oh, my God...!

224
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,521
They're mannequins.

225
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:34,133
l thought Sachiko and the girls
had been tortured and dumped here.

226
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,621
ls this a body?

227
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,923
A mutilated high school co-ed!

228
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,306
l can even see the veins under
her skin...

229
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:31,282
But she's not bleeding.

230
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,260
She's not decomposing.

231
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,401
She's not moving but not dead...

232
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:23,533
Hello.

233
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,026
No heartbeat.

234
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,406
lt must be a dummy.

235
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,405
Or a doll?

236
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:24,458
lt's firm...

237
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:30,599
And taut...

238
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:39,607
lt's not synthetic resin...

239
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:44,748
lt's so smooth.

240
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,520
lt feels like an action figure,
but it's not.

241
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,567
How soft.

242
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:17,419
Very well made.

243
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,660
She's cute...

244
00:29:58,461 --> 00:30:02,455
Amazing detail!
Look at the frills on the shorts.

245
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,371
OK, these are real!

246
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:20,046
lt must be some kind of
lifesize art figure.

247
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:24,053
Maybe not.

248
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:51,806
Hey...

249
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,696
l can't see from here.

250
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:09,191
OK, l know.

251
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:21,232
Nobody's on the 3rd floor.
He must be on the 4th.

252
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:26,044
l'll know where he's hiding.

253
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:27,345
How?

254
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,944
By the cobwebs that are in
every entrance.

255
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:37,917
Right, you're amazing, Yoshi!

256
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:30,169
Every strand of hair's separate.

257
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:33,076
So real!

258
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:09,549
This is a work of art!

259
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,878
How realistic...

260
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,954
How can it be so soft?

261
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:21,289
Let me massage you.

262
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:32,140
What craftsmanship...

263
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,837
lt feels alive.

264
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:46,249
Oh, no!

265
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,589
There's no hole!

266
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:53,497
lt really is a doll,
not a human!

267
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:56,529
That's shocking.

268
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,929
A lifesize art figure
with pubic hair.

269
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,238
You fooled me, girl.

270
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,200
l'm going to screw you!

271
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,534
Let's go home.

272
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:11,043
l'm tired.

273
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:13,679
Dolphin Lounge.

274
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,581
That's fishy.

275
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:16,846
How corny!

276
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:22,217
There's a dolphin!

277
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:24,260
l know he's here!

278
00:34:25,094 --> 00:34:26,459
Yoshi.

279
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,859
Any cobwebs?

280
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:48,416
This is not porn, it's art.

281
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,308
Who made it?

282
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:56,488
Amazing!

283
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,881
Oh, my God...!

284
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:18,034
Hey!

285
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,005
l'll fuck you!

286
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,970
No?

287
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:27,680
Please don't?

288
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,150
Anything but that?

289
00:36:31,587 --> 00:36:33,385
Think again, fool!

290
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:35,889
l won't stop.

291
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:40,587
No, please? l'll scream for help.

292
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,826
Nobody will come.
Nobody knows we are here.

293
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,264
No, please?

294
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,340
That's enough? l don't want to?

295
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:53,572
You bitch.

296
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,546
Don't resist if
you want to live.

297
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:03,577
Got it?

298
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:06,616
Well?

299
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,282
l'm serious. Help?

300
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:14,595
No, don't touch me there?

301
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:16,028
Stop talking!

302
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:29,638
How do you like this, huh?

303
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,215
Oh, it's so good?

304
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,812
What is good?

305
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:38,785
You're so big?

306
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:41,119
Oh, Kentaro?

307
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:48,191
Oh, this is pefect!

308
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:51,433
You won't complain
or hit me.

309
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,558
You just accept my love.

310
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:06,845
Come out!

311
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:15,458
Stop hiding! Come out!

312
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:19,793
Come the hell out!

313
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:23,526
Whoops...

314
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:28,864
How are you doing?
Are you coming?

315
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,769
l'm coming? l'm coming now

316
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,544
l'm coming too!

317
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,378
You're so tight.

318
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,646
l'm coming!

319
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:45,847
Me too? Come together?

320
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:48,390
We'll come together!

321
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:50,720
Oh, God!

322
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:54,054
Let's go!

323
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:56,996
He's not here.
It's spooky in here.

324
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,295
Leave me alone!

325
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:04,532
Let's go! Nobody's here.

326
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:06,073
Come out!

327
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,846
l've been here before.

328
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,419
With who?

329
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,051
Are you jealous?

330
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,527
l worked part-time here.

331
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:27,996
Did you sleep with your customers?

332
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:31,256
Where's the light switch?

333
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:39,940
l found it.

334
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,112
Nobody's here.

335
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:57,557
Let's give up and go home.

336
00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:00,028
l'm going to teach him a lesson.

337
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:09,295
Oh, my God!

338
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,874
This looks like Sachiko,
a girl l worked with!

339
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:14,906
What are these?

340
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,445
This looks like Masako!

341
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:22,141
lt's spooky!

342
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,119
There he is!

343
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:27,712
Come out!

344
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:33,824
Where are you going?

345
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,734
l found you!

346
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:45,431
Don't! Look, l'm bowing
for forgiveness.

347
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:51,110
You want some more?

348
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:03,754
l beg you to let me go.

349
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:13,493
Please let me off.

350
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:15,765
l lost my job so...

351
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:19,936
So what!

352
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:26,273
Kick him!

353
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,124
You idiot!

354
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:42,994
You should've said sorry
in the beginning!

355
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,197
Please don't kill me...

356
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:49,499
l have to send money to my mom
back home.

357
00:41:55,411 --> 00:42:00,076
lf you'd apologized
this wouldn't have happened.

358
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:03,084
That's why l hate men!

359
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,381
Too much trouble!

360
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:14,720
You're too much trouble! Die!

361
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:16,226
Hey, Hiromi.

362
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:22,101
Nobody has manners these days.

363
00:42:22,238 --> 00:42:23,569
Nobody teaches them.

364
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:27,541
l know He must be so dumb!

365
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:30,572
You're the best!

366
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:06,780
Yoshi.

367
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,742
l love you.

368
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:29,832
Sorry, that guy bothers me.

369
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:33,767
Come on.

370
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:40,680
Yoshi, wait for me!

371
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:42,733
l'm in trouble...

372
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,414
l feel like calling for Mom...

373
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:00,926
Maybe l'll die...

374
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:06,924
l just might.

375
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:11,566
Come out, l know you're there!

376
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:13,606
Leave him alone.

377
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:17,509
Let's go and pick up
where m left off.

378
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:22,615
l can see you hiding!

379
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:25,611
You dirty thieves!

380
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:29,584
l want to go now.

381
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:32,420
Give it up, Yoshi.

382
00:45:34,196 --> 00:45:38,064
l can see you. What are you
hiding for?

383
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:39,525
You!

384
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,261
l want to leave now please!

385
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:46,405
Why are you howling, brother?

386
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:49,236
Or maybe you're a sister.

387
00:45:49,311 --> 00:45:50,801
What were you snorting?

388
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:55,112
ls it a crime to sleep?

389
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:59,143
You going to charge us for
sleeping here?

390
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:03,820
You fell asleep smoking?
It stinks!

391
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:08,286
You know eveything.
Want some?

392
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:36,325
You bitch!

393
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:48,003
Who are you with?

394
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:51,037
Which gang?

395
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,133
l'm not a yakuza.

396
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:56,540
You must be.

397
00:46:57,346 --> 00:47:01,510
Were you looking for a quiet place
to screw?

398
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:05,384
You want me to get the cops?

399
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:06,521
What?

400
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,061
She's dead.

401
00:47:24,473 --> 00:47:26,840
She wasn't after us?

402
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:31,741
Who's after you?

403
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:36,881
The yakuza got pissed with us
and kicked us out.

404
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:40,684
So we stole heroine from them.

405
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:45,221
l thought they'd sent you.

406
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:50,596
Apparently not.
You scared the shit out of me.

407
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:58,371
l don't know what you're
talking about!

408
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:07,409
Hey, you!

409
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:13,944
Who?

410
00:48:15,924 --> 00:48:18,018
You're talking to the dummies?

411
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:22,260
Let go! Help me!

412
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:24,230
You have to help me!

413
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:33,734
Which end do you want?
Front or rear?

414
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:36,709
How about the boss?

415
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:39,782
He doesn't give a shit about women.

416
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:42,282
He hates them.

417
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:46,321
We'll decide
with rock, paper, scissors.

418
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,319
One, two, three!

419
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:50,458
l won!

420
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,187
Rear end again!
l feel homo!

421
00:48:54,963 --> 00:48:56,658
Oh, God, Yoshi is dead...!

422
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:15,774
Take care of me now.

423
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,687
Make her stroke you.

424
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,354
Damn!

425
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:01,557
The bitch isn't dead!

426
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,132
l'll make sure you are!

427
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:17,509
Man or woman?

428
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,883
She's a dyke.

429
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:23,145
She's the butch.

430
00:50:50,412 --> 00:50:51,504
Let's go.

431
00:50:52,781 --> 00:50:54,271
Boss.

432
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,881
How about her?

433
00:51:00,088 --> 00:51:02,022
l'll count to 10.

434
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,952
And you run.

435
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:06,617
Here l go!

436
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:12,265
One, two...

437
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:15,797
Three, four...

438
00:51:16,138 --> 00:51:19,631
Don't wait around!
Five, six...

439
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:24,311
- Seven, eight...
- My purse!

440
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:29,315
Nine.

441
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:37,455
There's a man down here.
He saw eveything!

442
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:41,058
l found him for you!

443
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:43,731
Let me go instead!

444
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:51,138
ls there another one?

445
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:53,505
l told you so.

446
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:08,321
You want him dead?

447
00:52:10,592 --> 00:52:12,822
He fucks dead women.

448
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,663
He'll be right with you.

449
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:28,268
See? He's a quick draw.

450
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:32,511
What's your problem?

451
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,210
My mother has dementia...!

452
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:41,288
Mine too but she's fine!

453
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,915
So l won't talk!

454
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:45,288
But you saw eveything.

455
00:52:46,695 --> 00:52:48,823
l'm the unluckiest man.

456
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:52,697
Killing me would
put a jinx on you!

457
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:57,034
We're lucky motherfuckers.

458
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:01,570
Yeah, ass-fucking mothers.

459
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:03,643
That's cool!

460
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:30,529
What are you looking at?

461
00:53:35,544 --> 00:53:39,276
OK, timeout. Now what?

462
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:41,507
You bitch!

463
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:43,574
Damn it!

464
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,562
Are you OK, Kentaro?

465
00:54:01,636 --> 00:54:03,968
Do l know you?

466
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:06,604
You want a piece of me?

467
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,201
Bitch!

468
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:02,746
Are you OK?

469
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:07,190
Wait for me!

470
00:58:10,485 --> 00:58:12,249
l'll call an ambulance?

471
00:58:12,387 --> 00:58:14,446
No, we shouldn't be seen.

472
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:20,055
Maybe they have a first aid kit
in their hideout.

473
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,729
Thank you.

474
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:27,558
No, thank you...

475
01:00:30,825 --> 01:00:32,020
Wow...

476
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:36,160
Who are you?

477
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:40,835
That's right...

478
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:47,039
She's the one in the uniform
who saved me and got shot...

479
01:00:50,945 --> 01:00:55,109
l bandaged her up.

480
01:01:09,397 --> 01:01:10,728
Hows the wound?

481
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:20,131
Wait...

482
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:26,009
There's no blood or wound...!

483
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:46,527
Ouch...

484
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,529
Shit, l'm late!

485
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,301
That's right.

486
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,539
l don't have to go to work...

487
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:58,572
l thought you were a human.

488
01:03:37,979 --> 01:03:39,140
lt's gone!

489
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,143
lt's gone!

490
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:48,316
They've gone too!

491
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:03,363
So it was all a dream?

492
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,502
Was l hallucinating?

493
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:15,542
How much of it?

494
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,909
How much of it did l
hallucinate?

495
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:49,447
Come to my place.

496
01:04:54,622 --> 01:04:56,522
You have nowhere to go.

497
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:02,287
l'm the same.

498
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:05,197
You must be tired.

499
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:09,931
Let's go.

500
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,169
Thank you for saving me.

501
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:15,308
Okay...

502
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,801
Legs together.

503
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,076
Here we go.

504
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,282
Oh, that wasn't right...

505
01:05:33,594 --> 01:05:34,891

506
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,024
Wow, l dropped you!

01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:42,325
l'm sorry.

508
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:45,670
Hold on, l'll get you.

509
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:57,813
Off we go.

510
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:37,187
She's too big for the train.

511
01:06:38,392 --> 01:06:39,553
l'll get a cab.

512
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:47,162
lt'll cost a lot but who cares...

513
01:06:57,545 --> 01:06:59,513
OK, one, two, three!

514
01:07:09,423 --> 01:07:10,686
lt's scary!

515
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:42,054
This is great.

516
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:46,192
lt's a bit messy but it's cozy.

517
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:54,797
lsn't it weird how
they blamed me for eveything?

518
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:58,103
Eveybody hates me!

519
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:03,833
Did l already tell you that?

520
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:08,676
Sorry.

521
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:14,752
After l quit, all l do is complain.

522
01:08:18,593 --> 01:08:21,062
Eat up. It'll get cold.

523
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,926
Have some tea too.

524
01:08:29,003 --> 01:08:31,665
What's your name?
Is it Mannequin?

525
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:36,676
You know.

526
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:41,874
You have no heartbeat
so l thought it ms sleep apnea

527
01:08:42,016 --> 01:08:45,452
but you'd still have a heartbeat.

528
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:51,424
So l had an inspiration.
How about the name Kokone?

529
01:08:51,592 --> 01:08:54,186
lt means heartbeat.

530
01:08:54,528 --> 01:08:56,519
You like it?

531
01:08:58,933 --> 01:09:00,458
Kokone.

532
01:09:02,536 --> 01:09:05,369
lt's nice. Thank you.

533
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:10,740

Nice to meet you.

534
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:19,551
Are you uncomfortable?
Let me fix it.

535
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:23,187
Why are these things here?

536
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:26,489
Hold on.

537
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:28,558
l'll remove them.

538
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:36,700
That's better.

539
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,901
Whoops, sorry!

540
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:02,056
Hang on...

541
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:08,358
Excuse me.

542
01:10:17,878 --> 01:10:19,073
Are you OK?

543
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:36,961
"Tokusen Publishers"

544
01:10:40,468 --> 01:10:42,061
"Yachiyo Press"

545
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:05,486
l'm home.

546
01:11:07,495 --> 01:11:08,963
Are you hungry?

547
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,662
l got 7-Eleven food.

548
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:15,264
Miss me? Sorry about that.

549
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:33,043
You peed!

550
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:35,683
l'll take care of it.

551
01:11:57,111 --> 01:11:58,306
Back up.

552
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:03,214
Your hair's messy.

553
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:09,284
Can you wee?

554
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:19,294
l visited some companies.

555
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:24,738
Maybe l've been
blacklisted.

556
01:12:26,373 --> 01:12:29,240
lf only someone would give me work.

557
01:12:59,106 --> 01:13:00,972
Turn around.

558
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:12,348
Hang on.

559
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:18,050
Let me tidy your hair.

560
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:38,240
How's the wound?

561
01:13:42,983 --> 01:13:44,678
l'll change the bandage.

562
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:03,897
That's it for now.

563
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,356
l still have money.

564
01:14:26,694 --> 01:14:30,824
So stay here as
long as you want.

565
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:35,529
To your heart's content,
Kokone. Get the pun?

566
01:14:37,171 --> 01:14:38,195
That's corny.

567
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:18,874
l can't!

568
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:25,074
You're making me self-conscious.

569
01:15:25,185 --> 01:15:27,586
Can l turn you away?

570
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:44,230
Right, how come l didn't notice?

571
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:45,931
You're cold!

572
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:54,274
You can put mine on.

573
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,635
Those sons of bitches.

574
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:26,403
So what if l don't have work?
l still have money.

575
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:30,444
l have a good feeling though.

576
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:34,951
My horoscope says l'll be
lucky tomorrow

577
01:16:35,055 --> 01:16:38,252
l wouldn't lose a bet!

578
01:16:39,993 --> 01:16:44,157
l'll win the daily double!
l fucking will!

579
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:48,766
Suck my big one!

580
01:17:46,059 --> 01:17:47,891
No losing, my ass!

581
01:17:51,732 --> 01:17:55,498
The horses hate me too!

582
01:17:55,969 --> 01:18:00,907
Times are bad but a
little win wouldn't hurt...

583
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:03,007
They win, l lose.

584
01:18:05,078 --> 01:18:07,479
Right, Kokone?

585
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:11,242
That's not true. Cheer up.

586
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:27,363
Am l hallucinating from the drink?
Or is it paranormal?

587
01:18:30,771 --> 01:18:33,536
Do you hear me?

588
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:37,206
l'm no good.

589
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:42,077
Whatever l do fails.
l don't deserve to live.

590
01:18:42,182 --> 01:18:46,016
lt'd be better for eveyone
if l died!

591
01:18:46,386 --> 01:18:48,946
By gas, knife or hanging...

592
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:51,448
You can pull my legs then.

593
01:18:54,862 --> 01:18:56,660
Gas is too catastrophic.

594
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,198
You know what?

595
01:19:05,005 --> 01:19:06,166
l can do it

596
01:19:08,742 --> 01:19:11,973
sitting down like this.

597
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,276
l can hang myself sitting.

598
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:25,391
You're not useless. Cheer up.

599
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,632
What's to be cheery about?

600
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:14,871
l won't fall for that.

601
01:20:26,053 --> 01:20:27,145
Who are you?

602
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:31,047
l'm with you every day.

603
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:33,389
l'll help you change.

604
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:36,557
You're...

605
01:20:37,864 --> 01:20:39,832
the lifesize figure.

606
01:20:43,737 --> 01:20:45,831
Who are you really?

607
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,508
Did you turn into a human
at the building?

608
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:53,741
l thought l imagined it...

609
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,180
l am Kokone.

610
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:04,989
Listen...

611
01:21:07,894 --> 01:21:09,384
Listen to me!

612
01:21:13,767 --> 01:21:14,928
Ouch!

613
01:21:16,703 --> 01:21:17,761
Wait.

614
01:21:27,614 --> 01:21:28,604
So you're...

615
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:31,849
a human?

616
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:40,887
What are you?
Stop fooling around!

617
01:21:41,628 --> 01:21:44,620
l'm drunk but l'm not!

618
01:21:57,277 --> 01:21:58,904
Don't be rough.

619
01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:10,421
l won't let them tread on me!

620
01:22:11,324 --> 01:22:14,783
l won't stay down without
a fight!

621
01:22:17,297 --> 01:22:18,230
lt hurts.

622
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:20,832
Be gentle.

623
01:22:29,509 --> 01:22:30,943
Kentaro!

624
01:24:15,182 --> 01:24:17,947
Tilt a little.

625
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:19,784
How's that?

626
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,839
l'm running out of money.

627
01:26:28,248 --> 01:26:31,081
But there are always loan sharks.

628
01:26:31,751 --> 01:26:32,912
OK.

629
01:26:36,756 --> 01:26:38,622
l'm good at mahjong.

630
01:26:39,926 --> 01:26:43,590
l'll win big and make money

631
01:26:44,831 --> 01:26:47,425
so l can start looking for work.

632
01:26:48,735 --> 01:26:50,225
But l've been unlucky.

633
01:26:52,172 --> 01:26:55,699
So l want you to help me
win a game.

634
01:26:58,578 --> 01:27:01,013
Tell me what moves to make.

635
01:27:02,949 --> 01:27:07,511
Don't worry. You are lucky.

636
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:11,314
Just believe in yourself.

637
01:27:12,792 --> 01:27:14,089
Besides

638
01:27:15,228 --> 01:27:18,630
l know nothing about mahjong.

639
01:27:20,133 --> 01:27:21,532
Just pick one.

640
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,131
Da Shan Yuan...

641
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:27,901
13 Orphans, 9 Gates of Heaven.

I've been chanting 9 Gates of Heaven.

660
01:29:09,342 --> 01:29:11,743
And nothing happens.

661

01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:20,560
Yes!

01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:24,098
l won with 9 Gates of Heaven!

683
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:29,639
Did you hear that, guys?
9 Gates of Heaven!

684
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:32,606
l'm the luckiest bastard!

685
01:32:32,712 --> 01:32:36,478
l did it! Thank you, Kokone!

686
01:32:37,684 --> 01:32:39,277
Pay up, pay up!

687
01:32:40,053 --> 01:32:42,579
Winning 9 Gates might kill you.

688
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:46,592
Watch out for cars.

689
01:32:47,894 --> 01:32:53,230
lt's so rare to win 9 Gates,
you've used up all your luck.

690
01:32:53,466 --> 01:32:55,628
Go home! l'm done.

691
01:32:57,437 --> 01:33:00,668
l have to go back to
the love of my life!

692
01:33:04,344 --> 01:33:06,642
She's my lucky star?

693
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:11,580
And my lucky star loves me?
l couldn't be happier?

694
01:33:12,151 --> 01:33:13,243
Awesome?

695
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:20,550
The lights are kind of far.
l'll cross here.

696
01:33:21,194 --> 01:33:25,495
The cars will dodge me
because l'm so lucky.

697
01:33:34,006 --> 01:33:35,496
Watch out!

698
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:42,512
l'm back!

699
01:33:44,484 --> 01:33:47,647
Kokone! l did like you said
and won!

700
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:53,319
Kokone.

701
01:34:01,968 --> 01:34:03,299
Kokone?

702
01:34:11,744 --> 01:34:12,973
Okay...

703
01:34:15,882 --> 01:34:17,350
She's gone.

704
01:34:20,219 --> 01:34:22,119
She's left me.

705
01:34:38,104 --> 01:34:39,469
l see.

706
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,514
lt makes sense.

707
01:34:54,187 --> 01:34:56,485
Nobody stays.

708
01:34:59,058 --> 01:35:01,686
Being with me isn't fun.

709
01:35:10,403 --> 01:35:16,137
lf she'd waited a little more
it would've been heaven.

710
01:35:28,955 --> 01:35:31,253
Oh, shut up...

711
01:35:35,795 --> 01:35:39,925
You idiot! Don't sing
in the middle of the night!

712
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:16,694
Just wait where you are.
My dear girl

713
01:36:18,137 --> 01:36:23,303
Because l'm coming home soon

714
01:36:24,544 --> 01:36:30,244
You don't need to
show your tears

715
01:36:31,317 --> 01:36:36,221
l will never go far

716
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:43,622
One day. someday

717
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:48,627
A bad day like today

718
01:36:50,002 --> 01:36:56,169
We will shrug it off
with a smile

719
01:36:56,676 --> 01:37:01,204
With just a little bit of luck

720
01:37:02,682 --> 01:37:08,678
Even if you can't see me

721
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:15,091
l'll always be nearby

722
01:37:16,262 --> 01:37:21,894
Just reach out your hand to me

723
01:37:22,902 --> 01:37:27,840
You'll feel your hand in mine

724
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:35,178
As long as you think of me

725
01:37:35,548 --> 01:37:40,418
forever and ever more

726
01:37:42,088 --> 01:37:47,891
l will stay right by your heart

727
01:37:48,995 --> 01:37:54,456
And never go away

728
01:39:34,366 --> 01:39:37,392
Don't worry. Cheer up.

729
01:39:38,771 --> 01:39:40,535
- Shall we dance?
- Listen.

730
01:39:40,973 --> 01:39:44,876
l won because l did
what you said.

731
01:39:45,177 --> 01:39:47,612
l'm not loaded yet
but l'm getting lucky.

732
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,772
l'm not a loser!

733
01:39:49,181 --> 01:39:50,706
l'm happy for you.

734
01:39:52,218 --> 01:39:54,380
l'm happy to have helped you.

735
01:39:55,888 --> 01:39:57,014
Dance with me.

736
01:39:59,425 --> 01:40:00,688
l can't dance.

737
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:04,361
Yes, you can.

738
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:14,529
lt's no big deal,
it's just mahjong.

739
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:19,241
Thank you.

740
01:40:27,019 --> 01:40:29,852
lt was almost ruined.

741
01:40:32,391 --> 01:40:34,018
How?

742
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:37,893
Just when things started to look up

743
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:41,989
a speeding truck came
zooming toward me!

744
01:40:42,067 --> 01:40:45,901
l ran and leaped and
there was a scream!

745
01:40:46,305 --> 01:40:48,069
What happened?

746
01:40:48,741 --> 01:40:54,544
They say there are 2 people in the
world who look like you.

747
01:40:55,948 --> 01:40:58,417
She looked exactly
like you, Kokone.

748
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:02,412
She left without thanking me.

749
01:41:02,888 --> 01:41:06,256
What were you doing
with a woman?

750
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:08,753
How could you?

751
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:10,590
No, l wasn't!

752
01:41:11,897 --> 01:41:13,092
Let's dance.

753
01:42:12,658 --> 01:42:14,148
Congratulations!

754

Things are flying for you!
You have everything, winner!

755
01:42:27,339 --> 01:42:30,331
Manager, why are you here?

01:42:34,647 --> 01:42:36,308
ls this candid camera?

757
01:42:37,349 --> 01:42:39,443
What a joker!

758
01:42:41,687 --> 01:42:44,281
The company depends on you!

759
01:42:45,291 --> 01:42:50,354
l was hard on you but
l knew you could do better!

760
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,931
Our future depends on you.

761
01:42:56,568 --> 01:42:59,230
l wouldn't dare take over
your position.

762
01:43:00,105 --> 01:43:02,199
Congratulations!

763
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:13,915

766
01:43:34,106 --> 01:43:38,509
You two look great together!

767
01:43:43,048 --> 01:43:45,244

770
01:44:07,773 --> 01:44:10,799
Congratulations, Kokone!

771
01:44:10,943 --> 01:44:12,411
Thank you.

772
01:44:13,779 --> 01:44:17,238
l really envy you
for marrying him!

773
01:44:17,316 --> 01:44:21,412
No matter how l tried
l couldn't get his attention!

774
01:44:23,222 --> 01:44:24,883
Gee, l don't know...

775
01:44:27,493 --> 01:44:29,461
Can l dance with you?

776

Can l?

777
01:44:34,099 --> 01:44:35,464
Let's dance.

778
01:45:05,497 --> 01:45:11,595
All the things one could wish for,
hopes, dreams and life

779
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:18,201
l will never bring them up
as long as l have you

780
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:24,873
We each have each other
just the two of us in the rain

781
01:45:25,584 --> 01:45:31,489
l can hear your song tonight
Life isn't all bad

782
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,224
Kokone, dance with me!

783
