1
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,995
Don't mourn
for Joe Strombel.

2
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,891
Joe Strombel led a full life.

3
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:53,255
A newspaperman
in the best tradition.

4
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:56,032
A great credit
to the fourth estate.

5
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:00,165
It didn't matter
if the bombs in the
war zone were falling.

6
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,726
It didn't matter
how high up
the political scandal went,

7
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,693
or how many
big corporations

8
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,288
or small-time racketeers
leaned on him.

9
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,455
Whatever the risk,
if there was a story there,

10
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,195
Joe went after it.
And he usually got it.

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,491
Well, I was with him
when the story broke
about Prince Charles,

12
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,362
and that made him
persona non grata
with the Royal Family.

13
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,297
Except with Diana.
They always remained
good friends.

14
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,991
(ALL AGREEING)
He did love a woman.

15
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,562
Hey, did you know he started
as a police reporter?

16
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,394
Did he?
Yeah, he was
a bloody good one.

17
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,398
One of the best.
Maybe the best.

18
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,897
I got trapped with Joe once
in Afghanistan.

19
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:37,954
Yeah?

20
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,224
And we were going
to be shot any moment
by the Taliban, until,

21
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,725
typically, Joe found
someone to bribe

22
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,492
(ALL LAUGHING)
So we could escape.

23
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,623
MAN 1: Not with his own money,
though.
No, no, he got it on expenses.

24
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,063
MAN 2: Plus 10%.
MAN 3: Ten percent.

25
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,299
But it did
involve us getting out
wearing burkas.

26
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:55,226
And, well, we lived
to write another day.

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,027
Everyone loved him.
Yeah.

28
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,792
MAN 1: Not always at
British intelligence.

29
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,059
No, but he got
the information
before anyone else.

30
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,189
Yeah, he did. That's right.
Not Richard Nixon, though.

31
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,499
Well, wherever you are now,
Joe, it won't be the same
without you, mate.

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,865
ALL: To Joe.
Joe Strombel.

So, what do you do?
Reporter.

Hmm.
You?

43
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,291
I'm... Well, I was
personal secretary
to Peter Lyman.

44
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,459
Lord Lyman's son.
Yes, impressive young man.

45
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,729
You knew him?
No, only by reputation.

46
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,496
But I like what I know.

47
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,525
I think he's got
a real future in politics.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,291
How did you die?

49
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:24,931
I think I was poisoned.

50
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,021
You think?

51
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:28,923
Why?

52
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:30,862
I believe I was poisoned

53
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,763
because I was
on the verge of confirming
a terrible suspicion.

54
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,794
Yes?
What suspicion is that?

55
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:40,694
That Peter Lyman
is the serial killer

56
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,591
known to the police
as the Tarot Card Killer.

57
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,824
(CHUCKLES) What?

58
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:48,092
I assume
you're aware of that case?

59
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:51,629
Yeah, I wrote an article
two years ago, when the
Tarot killings first started.

60
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,165
But Peter Lyman? My God.

61
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,126
What on earth
made you suspect

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,688
this rich, young handsome,
above-reproach citizen?

63
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,992
You remember the last murder?
The police found a clue.

64
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,390
Yes, a cufflink.
I read about it in the paper.
Unusual antique, wasn't it?

65
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,098
Yep.
Very rare Art Deco.

66
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,859
Peter had the exact pair.

67
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,793
So could have
the Tarot Killer.

68
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,456
The world is full
of coincidences.

69
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,794
Yeah, except I noticed
that Peter only had one left.

70
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,765
He'd lost the other.

71
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,392
Still,

72
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:25,493
although
it's a tantalizing thought.

73
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,998
Did you inform the police,
or was that too sticky?

74
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,291
I didn't know what to do,
so I phoned my lawyer

75
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,593
and I asked his advice
on whether to
report it or not.

76
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,261
And I thought
I heard this click
on the phone,

77
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,462
you know, like someone
had been listening.

78
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,660
Later that day, after tea,

79
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,630
I died suddenly.

80
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,061
That is suspicious.

81
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,758
My God, Peter Lyman.

82
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,297
Hard to believe,
but if he did turn out
to be the Tarot Killer,

83
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,258
what a story.

84
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,958
I knew you'd appreciate it
when you said
you were a reporter.

85
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,931
This would be
a dynamite scoop.
And I got it first.

86
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,056
Yeah. Unfortunately,
where you're headed
there is no first.

87
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,825
There's only last.

88
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,189
REPORTER 1: Mr. Tinsley!
Loved your last picture.

89
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,595
You really have a way
with actors.

90
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,030
Think you could maybe...
Please wait!

91
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,560
Mr. Tinsley?
Yeah.

Who?

93
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:36,431
Sondra Pransky.
I'm the journalism
student from Adair.

94
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,193
I wrote to you
about getting an interview
for the school newspaper.

95
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,254
Oh...

96
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:43,820
And you, well,
your secretary, actually,
because... Not you.

97
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,296
I mean, I know how busy
film directors get and all.

98
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,093
But you said
if I was in London visiting,
then you would, you know,

99
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:51,488
and here I am,
which is fantastic.

100
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,358
I think I have
your letter, actually.

101
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,692
See, right now
I'm a bit tied up.
Here it is!

102
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,265
Here it is.
This is so great for me.

103
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:01,163
I mean, you've got
a huge following in Rochester.

104
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,459
It gets very cold there.

105
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,361
With your new movie
coming out in the fall,
and... Well...

106
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,997
Actually,

107
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:11,028
I was wondering
if we could just ask you
a couple of questions.

108
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,462
Do you mind?
Okay, okay, but
we got to be real quick.

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,461
SONDRA: I write
for the cultural part
of the paper.

110
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:37,362
I'm looking to move into
more serious pieces.

111
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:41,755
And when you say something
more serious, that's...

112
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,098
You really want to know?

113
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,364
Well, originally, I wasn't
going to go to college.

114
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:52,455
I was going to become
a dental hygienist
like my sister, Beverly.

115
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:54,623
And, don't get me wrong,
it's a great profession.

116
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,154
I have very high respect
for teeth and gums,
particularly gums.

117
00:07:58,232 --> 00:07:59,664
My whole family's
in orthodontics. But...

118
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:03,062
And what?
You're vacationing here?
Oh, yes.

119
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:07,721
Oh, I'm just very friendly
with a very upper class
British family.

120
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,856
Our families vacationed
in Palm Beach together.

121
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,330
My mother
won a visit to Palm Beach

122
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,922
and I became friends
with their granddaughter,
Vivian.

123
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,658
She's so lovely.
She'll stay with us...

124
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:18,297
Another?
Oh, thanks.

125
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,863
So I slept with him
and I didn't even
get the interview.

126
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,455
I mean,
what kind of a reporter am I?

127
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,565
How was the sex?
Give me all the details.

128
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,223
Who knows? I was so drunk,
I don't even remember.

129
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:30,828
All I know is that
the second it was over,

130
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,092
he got a phone call
and had to leave
suddenly for Thailand.

131
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,154
Thailand?

132
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:38,029
Yeah, Justin Richards
got fired from some project
and he had to take over.

133
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,122
What difference does it make?

134
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,859
The point is,
I told the whole school

135
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,092
I'd get an exclusive
with Michael Tinsley!

136
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,154
(LAUGHING)
You were nervous.

137
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,431
You're inexperienced.
You drank.

138
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,056
He's a charming genius.

139
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,392
But you know,
you're a very attractive,
sexy girl.

140
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:52,954
If you're going to interview
movers and shakers
in their hotel rooms,

141
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,191
you better watch out.

142
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:57,288
Not that I'd mind
a roll in the hay
with Michael Tinsley.

143
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,496
I've put some fresh towels
in your bedroom, Sondra.

144
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:01,995
SONDRA: Thank you,
Mrs. Thompson.

145
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,758
Come on, sweetheart.
Chop, chop.
You're gonna be late.

146
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,661
Oh, Mom.
SONDRA: The point is
I didn't get the story!

147
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:09,459
I mean, if I'd used
my feminine wiles

148
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,225
like Katharine Hepburn
or Rosalind Russell.

149
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,663
Oh, come on.

150
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,561
We'll go have lunch
at The lvy,

151
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:15,825
and then we'll take
my little brother

152
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,694
to see that show
he's so excited about,

153
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,561
and then we'll go

00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,457
I would not tell this episode
to anyone else,

303
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,225
because they'll take away
your driver's license.

304
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:19,490
I don't understand.
What? What's to understand?

305
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,361
I thought that...
It's plywood.
I built it.

306
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:22,795
(STUTTERING)
What're you thinking,
there are spirits?

307
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,127
And there's
a world of departed people?

308
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,755
I don't know
what you've been smoking,

309
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:28,797
but don't try
and bring it through customs.

310
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,524
Darling,
I'm a little late.

311
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,588
Sweetheart, I love you.
You know that.

312
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:34,095
I say this
with all due respect, but...
I...

313
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,153
Sondra? Sondra?

314
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:37,827
Mr. Strombel.
Listen to me, Sondra.

315
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:41,562
Carefully. Listen to me, hmm?
Write this down.
This is a big story.

316
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:43,986
You got a pen?

317
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:46,997
STROMBEL: I only
have a minute.
Would you hurry?

318
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,453
Fine.

319
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:52,123
There's every reason
to believe that Peter Lyman...
You got that name?

320
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,528
Yes.
Peter Lyman.
Son of Lord Lyman,

321
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:56,688
a respected businessman, hmm?

322
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,993
Rich, good-looking,
very successful.

323
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:02,187
That Peter Lyman is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

324
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,595
Now, just
write this down.

325
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:08,993
If so, that he's murdered
a dozen women. Short-haired,
brunette prostitutes.

326
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:10,526
And if
it turns out to be Lyman,

327
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,757
this will be the biggest story
to hit London
since Jack the Ripper.

328
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:15,161
"Jack the Ripper."
Is that capitalized?

329
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,629
There's no knowing
where he'll strike next,

330
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,324
but more women
will be murdered
until he is stopped.

331
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,956
That's horrible!
We have to notify the police.

332
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,496
No, no.
What kind of reporter are you?

333
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:26,532
That would be a disaster!
God, no!

334
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:29,564
He's a respected millionaire.
You can't accuse anyone,

335
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,029
let alone someone like that
without substantial proof.

336
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:36,326
And once you've alerted him
to the suspicion...
That he is under suspicion,

337
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,955
then he'll be
impossible to trap.

338
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:39,827
(CHUCKLES) Not to mention
doubly dangerous.

339
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:42,796
There's also a possibility
that he poisoned his secretary

340
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:45,797
because he suspected that
she was learning the truth.

341
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,263
No, you have to
get the story first,

342
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,763
but first you have to
get the story right!

343
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,725
There's no certainty
in this, or...

344
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,727
I got a feeling
in my gut about this.

345
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,821
The kind
that journalists dream about.

346
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:00,726
And so far, no one else
has the information.

347
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,762
(CHUCKLES) Oh,
if I was around today,

348
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,921
I'd find a way
to get the facts

349
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,294
and break this case
wide open!

350
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,796
Now, believe me, Sondra.

351
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,427
You can wait your whole life
for a story like this.

352
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,964
Don't blow it.

353
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:18,125
And be careful.
Lives are in the balance.

354
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,094
Possibly, maybe yours.

355
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,758
Got to go. Got to go.

356
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,197
That's it for me.
You got to help me with this.

357
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:39,163
Not me, honey.
I'm a prestidigitator.

358
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,822
I do coin tricks
and card tricks.

359
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:42,489
And I'm a journalist
sitting on top of

360
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,156
one of the biggest
stories of all time!

361
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,891
Yeah. For a college paper!

362
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,192
Kid, you're in
over your head.

363
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:50,163
You know what you should do?
You should share this story.
Share it?

364
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,061
No!
I gotta dig up the facts

365
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,796
and then
I gotta shop it around
to every paper in town.

366
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,491
(MUTTERING)
Look at her.

367
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,088
Soon you'll be drinking
the black coffee

368
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,028
and smoking cigarettes
with the hat back.
Now, what kind of...

369
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,563
We don't have much time here.

370
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:04,359
I mean, we got to strike!
You know this guy's
a serial killer.

371
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,795
He could just kill
at any moment!

372
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,763
I heard that part.
That's when I knew
I was gonna make other plans.

373
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:11,888
You should go call the police.
That's what I'd do.

374
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,363
Yeah, and
what am I gonna tell them?

375
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,330
Tell them that...
Exactly what he told you.

376
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:19,694
That Lord Lyman's son,
Peter, is... He suspects
he's a serial killer.

377
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:22,763
Uh-huh, and when they ask me
where I got this
information from?

378
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,695
(STUTTERING) Well, tell them!
You know, just say,
you know tell them...

379
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:27,728
Just explain to them that...

380
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,793
You know, say that...
Tell them...

381
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,320
Where did you get
the information?

382
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,297
Was that the question
that you just asked?

383
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,357
I would not say anything
if I were you 'cause
they'll put you away.

384
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:40,398
(STUTTERING) That's exactly
what I'm saying.

385
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:43,158
I'm gonna say,
"I got this information
from a dead guy"?

386
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:46,459
Listen, this is not for me,
Sondra. I don't do this.

387
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:49,520
I do occasional bar mitzvahs
and kids' parties.

388
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:52,354
You know, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

389
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:54,761
Peter Lyman.
Who is Peter Lyman, you know?

390
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,990
How can we meet him?

391
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,327
How can we see
what we're dealing with here?

392
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:06,953
(SCOFFING)

393
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,722
What the hell are we doing
here? You don't even know
what the guy looks like.

394
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:11,786
That's why we're here.

395
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:14,161
I just couldn't get
a clear picture of him
on the Internet, so...

396
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:18,130
(STUTTERING) Jesus.
And what are we going to do
if we see him?

397
00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:20,255
I mean, what
are you gonna learn
by looking at him?

398
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:23,661
Unless he
strangles a passerby.

399
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:25,958
I don't know, Sidney.
I'm improvising.

400
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,689
I should be home,
working on my magic.

401
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:31,363
Hey, why don't you
think about this

402
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:33,091
as adding
some excitement to your life?

403
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,888
Hey, sweetheart,
excitement in my life

404
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,487
is dinner
without heartburn after it.

405
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:41,792
Do you have a family?

406
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:49,357
I had a wife,
but she dumped me,
if you can believe that.

407
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:52,031
Somehow...

408
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,423
She thought I was immature
and that I never grew up.

409
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,161
Now, I had
a great rebuttal for her.

410
00:21:58,232 --> 00:21:59,390
I could have nailed her,
you know,

411
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:03,624
but I raised my hand
and she would not call on me.

412
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,091
Sidney...
What?

413
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,256
That's him.

414
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,758
Let's follow him.

415
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,554
Follow? What do you
want to follow him for?

416
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,961
I'm telling you.
We need clues, we need a lead.
We gotta start someplace.

417
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:20,429
No, darling, I do not think
this is a good idea.

418
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:21,759
It's a very good idea.

419
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:25,619
Come on!

420
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:33,819
Be careful.

421
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,497
Hey, don't touch anything.

422
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,054
You know,
if you break something here,

423
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:41,654
you're gonna be washing dishes
the rest of your life.

424
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:42,920
(EXCLAIMS)

425
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:49,487
SID: Okay,
now you've seen him. Let's go.

426
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:53,053
Jerry! It's Jerry Burke,
Louis' chiropractor.

427
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:54,495
Hi.
Nice to see you.

428
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:57,562
That's how you follow a guy?
It's not even Peter Lyman!

429
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:59,756
I told you
the photos weren't clear.

430
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:02,695
Sweetheart,
you should live
and be well, prosper.

431
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:05,424
I hope... I say this
with all due respect.

432
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:06,794
But without me.

433
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:10,627
I'm tired, I'm bored,
I'm hungry, I'm going home.
God love you.

434
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:12,823
I'll look for your byline.
Sidney!

435
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:17,592
I'm about to become
your favorite person.
Why?

436
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,654
I ran into someone today
who said that Peter Lyman

437
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,697
swims at the Governor's Club
every day.

438
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,592
Really?
What's the Governor's Club?

439
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:24,926
It's this posh, private club,

440
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:27,361
but Daddy's partner's a member
and members are allowed
to bring guests.

441
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,522
Wow, do you think
I could bring someone?

442
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:32,030
I'm sure
Daddy can arrange it.
When do you want to go?

443
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:42,163
How can I help you?

444
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:44,493
Hi.
We're guests of the Fultons.

445
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:45,792
We're here to take a dip.

446
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:48,161
Oh, yes, yes. The lockers
are on the first floor.

447
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:49,663
The pool's downstairs.
Great.

448
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:52,931
By the way,
is Peter Lyman here,
by any chance?

449
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,123
Mr. Lyman.

450
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,630
Yes, came in
a few minutes ago.

451
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:57,493
What color bathing suit
does he have on?

452
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:58,553
Hey.

453
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:01,120
I... Do you want me
to clash with him?

454
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:04,120
So silly.

455
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:08,195
So do you swim?
Of course I don't swim.
You have to ask?

456
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,389
What? They say
it's the best form
of exercise.

457
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,255
Yes, but when
I go into the water,

458
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:16,025
my glasses, you know,
float off my head
into the pool.

459
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,987
Hey, Sidney,
that's got to be him.

460
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,462
Yeah, well,
make sure this time.

461
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:23,292
'Cause I don't want
to swim around after
another chiropractor.

462
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:24,921
Hmm, he's very handsome.

463
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:29,497
This guy is a serial killer
like I play for
the New York Jets.

464
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,562
How can we meet him?

465
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:34,924
(STUTTERING) I don't know.
They have a class system.

466
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:37,623
He's an aristocrat,
and, you know,
we're commoners.

467
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:41,628
In fact, according to his
system, I think we're probably
classified as scum.

468
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,562
This is our only chance.
He's all alone.

469
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:46,563
Well, you're
a pretty girl.

470
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:50,120
You know, I think you could
probably get this guy
to get interested in you.

471
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,892
Don't be silly.
Particularly if he's got
a twisted mind.

472
00:24:55,398 --> 00:24:57,591
Look, I can't
just go up to him and say,
"Hi, how are you?"

473
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:00,688
I mean,
what if he gets suspicious,
or, you know,

474
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,163
if he gets put off, or...

475
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:04,252
Drown.

476
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:07,589
What?
Drown! Drown!
I'll go get... I'll go get...

477
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:08,961
(SCOFFS)
Listen to me!

478
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,224
I'll go get coffee.

479
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:13,230
Get a cramp,
go in the water,
flounder around,

480
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:14,491
you know. Yes!

481
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:17,691
Go ahead, sweetheart.
That's a great idea.

482
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:20,458
He'll be obliged
to save you that way.

483
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:23,554
And if he doesn't...
lf, you know...
Then I'll notify your parents.

484
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:54,986
SONDRA: (GASPS) Help!

485
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:57,691
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

486
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:02,020
Help!

487
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,657
(SONDRA GASPING)

488
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,890
(SONDRA COUGHING)
It's all right. Shh.

489
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,857
It's okay.
There you go.

490
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,822
Are you all right? Okay.

491
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:21,053
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:23,164
(COUGHING)
All right, here.
Here we are.

493
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,196
Here we are. You all right?
Thank you.

494
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,726
You okay?
Yes, thank you very much.

495
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,559
Sorry.
It's my pleasure.
Here, let me help you out.

496
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:30,819
(GRUNTS)

497
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:33,456
I'm not a very good swimmer.

498
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:35,194
(COUGHING)
It's all right.

499
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:36,559
My leg cramped.

500
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:37,688
Your leg?
Here, stretch it out.

501
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:38,822
Oh.
That's it.

502
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,158
Thank you.
No problem.

503
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,830
Listen, you should always
do a little stretching
before you go in.

504
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:45,454
You know,
that way you won't cramp.
Oh, thank you very much.

505
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:48,064
I haven't been swimming
in so long.

506
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:50,094
You're a new face.

507
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:51,988
Have you
just become a member?

508
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:54,462
Oh, no,
I'm a guest of the Fultons.

509
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,791
Oh, right, Jack Fulton.
Yes, lovely chap.

510
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,029
I'm Peter Lyman, by the way.
Hi, Son...

511
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:01,519
Sond...

512
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:04,222
Jade.

513
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,691
Jade Spence.

514
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,828
Jade Julliard Spence.

515
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,794
That's a very pretty name.
Thank you.

516
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:14,386
Yes, we're the Spences of...
Of Palm Beach.

517
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:17,592
Oh, not the same Spences
who own the shipping line?

518
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:19,194
No, no, no.

519
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:23,229
My father's into
silver and gold

520
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:25,230
and drilling.
Ah.

521
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:26,588
For wells.

522
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:28,955
What are you doing
in London?

523
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:31,896
I'm here visiting friends
in Holland Park.

524
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,193
Oh, good.
What do you do, Jade?

525
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:37,059
Well, I am an actress.

526
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,392
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:40,858
Yes, actually
I'm up for the part of Desiree

528
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:42,955
in the new Mike Tinsley film.

529
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:44,861
Oh, well, you're certainly
beautiful enough.

530
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,588
(GIGGLING) Thank you.

531
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,492
Look, Jade,

532
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:49,955
if you're not busy,

533
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:52,793
my father's giving
a garden party
at the estate on Sunday

534
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:54,125
and I'd love you to come.

535
00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:57,322
I'd be very happy
to be your date
and show you around.

536
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:00,262
The English countryside
is very lovely
this time of the year.

537
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:02,490
Sounds fantastic.
Good.

538
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,029
Do you mind
if I bring my father?

539
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,594
Your father?

540
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,789
Oh, look!
There he is right now.

541
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:10,252
Ah.

542
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:12,294
I was in the lounge.
I heard you drowning.

543
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:15,558
I finished my tea and scones
and came immediately.

544
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:17,357
SONDRA: Dad,
this is Peter Lyman,

545
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,124
who was nice enough
to rescue me.

546
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,186
Dad?

547
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:26,058
Yes, of course, child!

548
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:29,222
She cannot swim.
The girl cannot swim.

549
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,491
Like a lead weight,
she sinks to the bottom
all the time.

550
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:36,529
It's a family trait.
Lack of buoyancy, or...
Her siblings have it as well.

551
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:39,462
Yes, well, listen,
pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Spence, right?

552
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:40,554
Yes.

553
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,028
Yes, and I'll see you
on Sunday at the estate.

554
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,290
Oh, great.
Sunday? What's Sunday?
Not a fox hunt?

555
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:48,420
(CHUCKLING)
No. No, Dad.
I'll explain it to you later.

556
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:50,554
Listen, I'll leave
all the information
at the desk, all right?

557
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,028
Hey, come, child.

558
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:57,196
What kind of idiot are you?
Not a fox hunt?

559
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:00,059
I'd like
to talk to these people
in their own terms.

560
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:02,753
And, oh,
thanks for telling him
I'm your father.

561
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:05,659
Oh, incidentally, he thinks
my name is Jade Spence,

562
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,253
so that makes you
Mr. Spence.

563
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:10,491
Wait a minute, I... This is
too tricky. I don't want to
go ahead with this.

564
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,722
Why? What's wrong with you?
Your whole life is deception.
You're a magician.

565
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,820
Yes, I'm a magician
and I want to stay a magician.
Can I have a Coke please?

566
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:19,295
I don't want to get sued
or deported

567
00:29:19,364 --> 00:29:21,694
or arrested
for stalking somebody.

568
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,890
This is a big guy
you're dealing with.

569
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,760
This is a big story,
no kidding.
That's what Joe Strombel said.

570
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,592
That's why he returned,
you know. This is
his last big scoop.

571
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:30,892
Hey. What do I care
about Joe Strombel?

572
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:34,658
Suddenly I'm taking direction
from a hunk of ectoplasm?

573
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,697
This could be
very big for my career.

574
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:40,759
Your career's fine.
You're on the college Bugle,
or whatever it is.

575
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:42,421
You got years for scoops.

576
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,121
You know what?
Forget you, all right.

577
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:47,187
I'll do this on my own.
I don't need you.
Go back to your card tricks.

578
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:49,025
I didn't say
I wouldn't help you.

579
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:51,655
You know, I just...
It has to be done properly.

580
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:54,054
You know, we gotta
put our heads together.

581
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:57,128
If we put
our heads together,
you'll hear a hollow noise.

582
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,060
Look at this place.
All it's missing is a moat.

583
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:25,724
Ooh! Hey,
I could get used to this.

584
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:27,625
Look at this.

585
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:32,530
SONDRA: Oh, there he is.
Remember, Jade Spence.

586
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,060
Jade...
Jade, who?

587
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,660
(MUMBLING)

588
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,429
Ah.
PETER: There you are.

589
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:41,293
Hello.
How are you? Welcome,
Mr. Spence and Jade.

590
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:42,523
Mr. Spence.

591
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:46,030
You look stunning. Stunning.
Oh, thank you.
It's beautiful here.

592
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:47,188
Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

593
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,753
It's been in the family
for years. About 400 years.

594
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:51,763
It's a little stuffy
for my taste, but...
Oh.

595
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,126
She said,
"All that's missing
is a moat."

596
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:57,230
Right.
(CHUCKLES) I love that.
I love the moat line.

597
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:00,321
"All that's missing
is a moat." Beautiful.
Ah, this is my father.

598
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:02,859
Father, Stephen Lyman,
this is... These are
my friends from America

599
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:04,261
I was telling you about.
Oh, Lord Lyman.

600
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,352
Jade Spence, Mr. Spence.

601
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,962
How are you?
Hello.

602
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,327
Curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
I've never met a Lord before.

603
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:11,489
How exciting!

604
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,395
No, but there was
that Earl that we...
There was that Earl.

605
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,190
I do hope
you're enjoying yourself.

606
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,196
Peter, why don't you
show them around?

607
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,797
Absolutely.
Would you like that?

608
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:21,954
Oh, it...
Charmed, I'm sure.

609
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,325
Should we hit
the buffet table first though?

610
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:25,762
No, Dad.
Because the stuff
looks great.

611
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,319
Remember,
we wanted to look around.

612
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:29,227
(CHUCKLING)
Yes, of course, of course,
blessed offspring.

613
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:31,594
Why don't we get a drink
and then we'll start inside?

614
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,162
SONDRA: Oh, okay.
Come.

615
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,762
Yes, I love this room here.
We often spend
evenings in here.

616
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,353
The English countryside!

617
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:45,691
It's elegant,
yet understated. I like that.

618
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,296
You've done wonders
with the place.

619
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:49,123
(CHUCKLES)
It brings to mind Trollope.

620
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,159
Oh, do you enjoy
reading Trollope, too?

621
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:53,787
No, no, not the author.
This was a girl I knew.

622
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:57,026
Well, come. Let's go upstairs
and have a look at the view.

623
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,085
Oh.

624
00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:00,890
Would you quit fooling around!
What's wrong with you?

625
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:03,088
Try to pick up clues,
try to remember things.
I'm charming him.

626
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,630
I remember. I got
a mnemonic system that I use.

627
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,720
I use images, it's a trick.
Uh-huh, yeah.

628
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,319
Say I want to remember
this ashtray.

629
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:13,626
I think of, like, 50 ashtrays
dancing on a desert island
in hula skirts or something

630
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,989
and then I remember.
I can call it
to mind whenever I...

631
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,462
Where are you going?

632
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,796
This is
one of the drawing rooms.

633
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:22,190
Wow, this is
really beautiful, isn't it?

634
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:24,560
Oh, here we have...
This is my great-grandfather.

635
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:27,563
There's grandfather
and his wife, Lady Hayden.

636
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:30,790
Reminds me of
the portrait of Aunt Hillary
in the library, no?

637
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:35,527
Game woman, Hillary.
Suffragette, I believe.
Yeah. Diphtheria took her.

638
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,456
Or perhaps it was elm blight.

639
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:40,290
Come on, Dad.

640
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,993
SONDRA: Oh,
this is just beautiful. Wow.

641
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:45,587
Yes. I love the lake.
Do either of you fish?

642
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:47,755
No, no, never have.
Oh, I'll have to teach you.

643
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:50,260
I've taken some salmon,
you know. Organic.

644
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,021
Yes, me, too.
I fly fish a little. But...

645
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:55,388
So, Jade, do you
enjoy concerts?

646
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,157
I'm very big
on the Philharmonic.

647
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,629
We sponsor, in fact.

648
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:00,822
I used to play the violin,
very, very badly.

649
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:05,429
But I have a number of...
Well, actually quite a large
musical collection.

650
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:07,191
Do you play an instrument,
either of you?

651
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:08,560
Because we have
these lovely music gatherings.

652
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:09,823
I do. Yes, I play the...

653
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:10,885
(GRUNTS)

654
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:14,430
Various classics,
you know, Noel Coward
and Shakespeare and...

655
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:18,294
Right.
We gave her piano lessons
when she was a little girl,

656
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,159
but her fingers
were just too stubby. So...

657
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:23,492
Yes, what about you,
Mr. Spence?

658
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:25,488
Well, I play the blues harp.

659
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:27,925
It's a little metal thing
you put in your mouth

660
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,292
and makes a twanging sound.
Very musical.
Yes, yes.

661
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,592
Used to be called
the Jew's harp, but you know
how those people are.

662
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:36,256
The slightest hint
of anti-Semitism
and they write letters.

663
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:39,827
I would love it if you could
teach me how to fly fish.
That would be great.

664
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:41,090
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

665
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:45,659
Okay, I want you to
watch me very closely. Pay
very strict attention here.

666
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:47,229
Now I want you
to take a card.

667
00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:48,786
Take any card you like.
You got it?

668
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,558
Go ahead, sweetheart. Take it.
You got it?
Mmm-hmm.

669
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,256
Now put it
in your pocketbook.
Put the card...

670
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,524
She's gonna put the card
in her pocketbook.

671
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,722
You got it? All right,
now tell everybody
what the card was.

672
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,653
It was the six of hearts.
Six of hearts.

673
00:33:57,797 --> 00:33:58,785
Can I ask you a question?

674
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,887
Was it
this six of hearts?

675
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,424
But I just put that
in my bag.

676
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,725
Well, check your card.
Check your card.

677
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:06,419
It's amazing!

678
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:08,923
You're
a wonderful sport, Claire.

679
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:10,724
I mean that sincerely.
God bless you.

680
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:13,195
You're a very sweet woman,
and this has been
a great group.

681
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:16,458
From the bottom of my heart,
I say this with
all due respect.

682
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:20,130
You're a wonderful... A credit
to your race and a
magnificent group of people.

683
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:22,959
You know,
I must find out who
does the hedges here.

684
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:24,724
Back home,
my topiary moose

685
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:27,093
is starting
to look a little shabby
around the antlers.

686
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,959
(LAUGHING) What do you do,
Mr. Spence?

687
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:30,929
(STUTTERING) Me?
I'm in real estate.

688
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:32,695
I'm sorry, I'm in oil!
I'm in oil.

689
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:34,424
(STUTTERING) I was in
real estate,

690
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:39,328
but, you know, land is
so difficult to come by now,
especially outdoors.

691
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:40,557
It's become a problem.

692
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,290
Incidentally,
I accept your invitation.

693
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:45,227
I will play poker
this weekend.

694
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:49,660
Now that I've seen
how good you are
at cards, can we trust you?

695
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,194
(LAUGHING)

696
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:55,023
Tell me about yourself, Peter.
This is all so new to me.

697
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:56,619
Well, what would you
like to know?

698
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,194
Well, I don't know.
Anything you'd care to reveal.

699
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,090
You know, your hopes,
your dreams.

700
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:08,194
Well, I come
from a privileged family,
as I'm sure you can tell.

701
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:11,124
It was always
decided one day
I would enter politics.

702
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:15,652
My hobbies are polo
and... Oh, I own
some racehorses.

703
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,322
Hmm.
So, how's that for a start?

704
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,758
(CHUCKLES)
And what are
your hopes and dreams?

705
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:25,354
I like to dance
and visit museums

706
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:27,623
and, oh,
I can cook Chinese food.
Ah.

707
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:30,090
If you know any good
Chinese restaurants...

708
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:36,192
Oh, I've gotten very
interested in New Age
phenomena recently.

709
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:37,321
Like what?

710
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:42,391
You know,
mystical things like

711
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:47,792
astrology and crystals
and Tarot.
Mmm-hmm.

712
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:50,122
Do you know anything
about Tarot cards?

713
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,523
Not really.
I'm more scientific-minded.

714
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:54,086
I find that if...

715
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,289
What are you staring at?

716
00:35:58,164 --> 00:35:59,720
Hmm? Oh.

717
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:01,892
You have wonderful enamel.

718
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:05,024
(CHUCKLING) Thank you.
Thank you.

719
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:07,688
You know, I'd love to take
you dancing one night.
I'm a good dancer.

720
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:10,290
Oh, I would love that.
That would be great.

721
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,060
Can I confess something?

722
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,419
Sure.

723
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:14,825
I just love
an American accent,

724
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:17,090
and I find
much of what you say
very amusing.

725
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:18,286
Oh.

726
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:20,225
I'll take that
as a compliment.

727
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:22,059
And since you like
Chinese food,

728
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:23,994
I'm gonna have
my new secretary

729
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:26,189
send you a list
of the great ones in town.

730
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,795
Oh, you have a new secretary?
Oh, yes.

731
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,556
Yes, I'm breaking in
someone new.

732
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,154
My previous secretary died,
a young woman, just very
suddenly of a blood clot.

733
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,322
It was awful.

734
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:39,396
Did they do an autopsy?

735
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,396
How did we
get on to this morbid subject?

736
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:44,362
So, you've never seen
a real English garden before?

737
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,692
Come.
I have a couple of treasures.

738
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:15,089
Would I offend you
if I told you something?
Probably not.

739
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:19,562
You're very...
Very different from
the women I usually meet.

740
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,618
Hmm.

741
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,291
That's a good thing.

742
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:25,523
Well, I just can't seem to get
the vision of you in your
swimsuit out of my mind.

743
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:26,927
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

744
00:37:27,097 --> 00:37:28,154
It was marked down.

745
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:30,957
(CHUCKLES) See, that...
Now that's exactly
what I mean.

746
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:34,327
You just have this very direct
and informal way about you.

747
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:37,091
It's...
You take after your father.
Mmm-hmm. Great.

748
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,854
And you have
a very sensual quality.

749
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:43,053
It's... But I'm sure

Wow. You work really fast.

751
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,023
Oh, God. Am I
overbearingly aggressive?
I'll stop.

Oh, no, don't!

were getting warmed up.

"Do you believe in
love at first sight?"

a cliche but...

an experience

just right away?

I could have strangled you
if you didn't shut up!

767
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,957
And stop telling people
I sprang from your loins.

that I'm your father!

That guy was so fantastic.
I can't imagine
he'd do anything bad.

This guy
is not a serial killer,
believe me.

771
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:41,952
I'd be very surprised
if he even killed one person.

772
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:43,956
He asked me to go dancing
next week.

773
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:48,120
That's a perfect strategy!
You worm your way in
like a rodent or a roach

and as the crumbs
fall off the table,

you collect them and
we analyze them. Aha! Voila!

It's a doodle.
He doodled it!

779
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:02,190
How do you know
he doodled it? How do
you know this is his?

780
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,490
What do you mean,
how do I know it's his?

781
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,087
I stole it out of
his overnight bag.

What the hell
is wrong with you, Sidney?

It's not a clue.

It's not a clue.

It could be his aunt,
it could be his travel agent.

we had nothing in common.

he likes that or something.

did he have time
to strangle somebody

and make the card game,
yes, he had plenty of time.

we know his social circle,

Nothing would
please me more. Come on.

00:46:24,497 --> 00:46:26,928
I really can't.
Oh, why not?

902
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:30,959
(STUTTERING) My father.
He's feeling not that great.

903
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,223
Nothing serious?
No, no, nothing.

904
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:35,462
Just a tooth problem.

You know,
a little sensitivity
in lower seven.

906

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

908
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:48,920
Oh. So, let me
get back to the story.

909
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:53,294
(STUTTERING) I'm on stage.
I'm doing the
dematerializer trick

910
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:55,352
with this chick
from Manchester.

911
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,893
I don't know
where they get these people,

912
00:46:57,963 --> 00:47:00,225
but she looked like
Sitting Bull.

913
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:02,885
And I got her in the thing,
and I vanish her

914
00:47:02,963 --> 00:47:06,418
and everything
goes according to plan
exactly and she's gone.

915
00:47:06,797 --> 00:47:09,661
And suddenly,
Strombel appears.
What?

916
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,227
Yes, Strombel's in there!
I got a tremendous hand
from the audience.

917
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,023
I wish
I could do it every night!

918

What did he say?

919
00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:19,454
He gave me
the combination to a safe.

920
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,553
What safe, I have no idea.

921
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:23,629
I didn't see any safe.

922

Well, did you
accomplish anything besides
maybe a possible pregnancy?

923

I'll tell you what I did see.

924
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,419

has short-cut, brunette hair.

but not a hooker?

No, Sidney,
she's not a hooker!

927
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:43,619
I hardly think so.
She's practically royalty.

to figure out
the various ramifications.

he's innocent.

must be some lover, you know.

you're ready to dump
the whole story.

where he keeps his precious
musical instruments.

Okay,
so there is a combination!

to get in that room.

Do you have the combination?

he wants me to come.

seems smitten with you.

happening to be thinking
of the seven of spades?

I had more time to practice,

her to many specialists,

My mnemonic system failed me.
What do you want me to say?

1048
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:35,018
Now exactly
what are we looking for
in here? This is all...

1049
00:54:35,096 --> 00:54:36,652
I'm not really sure.

1050
00:54:37,063 --> 00:54:38,653
You're not sure?

1051
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:40,386
Well, you know,
don't break anything.

1052
00:54:40,496 --> 00:54:43,485
By God, we'll get caught
and God knows.

1053
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:45,318
Hey, you know
the old dirty joke

1054
00:54:45,397 --> 00:54:48,022
about how
the French horn player
sleeps with his wife at night?

1055
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,026
Sidney,
put that thing down!

1056
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:52,357
Will you excuse me?

1057
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:58,558
There's nothing
but musical instruments
in here.

1058
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,822
I'm telling you,
we're on a wild goose chase.
Believe me.

1059
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:02,885
PETER: Jade?
What's the matter?

1060
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:04,723
Did you hear that?

1061
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:08,087
I thought I heard something.
Oh, come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

1062
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,162
All we need
is to get caught in here.

1063
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:13,084
Jade?

1064
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:16,291
Ah, there you are.
I was searching for you.

1065
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:17,953
The guests
will be leaving soon.

1066
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:21,493
Yes, well, I was
just showing Father around.
He loves English homes.

1067
00:55:21,629 --> 00:55:23,289
Yes, I was very impressed
with your cellar.

1068
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:25,590
I have
a wonderful cellar myself.

1069
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:28,720
No wine,
but it's rodent free.

1070
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,695
PETER: (CHUCKLING) Well,
let's get a drink.

1071
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:33,127
Please, Mr. Spence,
I haven't seen you
with a drink all night.

1072
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,153
Can you stay the night,
please?
What?

1073
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:36,689
Come on.
No, I can't.

1074
00:55:36,763 --> 00:55:38,456
Why not?
My father.

1075
00:55:38,529 --> 00:55:40,552
Oh, come on, I'll have
my driver take him home.

1076
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,458
No.
I can't let you go.
You're too beautiful.

1077
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:44,619
(MOANING)
Look at you. I can't.

1078
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,957
(SIGHING)

1079
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:40,287
Jade?

1080
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:48,990
SONDRA: Oh.
Jade.

1081
00:57:50,996 --> 00:57:53,053
Jade, it's 4:00 a.m.

1082
00:57:53,163 --> 00:57:54,628
What are you doing?

1083
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,153
I couldn't sleep,

1084
00:57:57,229 --> 00:58:00,162
so I thought
maybe some milk.

1085
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:01,651
Hmm.

1086
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:06,253
Jade, can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.

1087
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:12,393
Would you consider
not going home at the end
of the summer?

1088
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:16,226
SID: I don't understand,
what more proof do you need?

1089
00:58:16,296 --> 00:58:17,694
What are you gonna tell
the police?

1090
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:20,556
The guy
owns a deck of Tarot cards.
That's not a crime.

1091
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:22,691
I mean, what, he was late
for a poker game?

1092
00:58:22,763 --> 00:58:24,991
I'm sure he's smart enough
to have an alibi.

1093
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,823
What are we left with?
His mother has
short-cut, brunette hair.

1094
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:29,794
I mean, look,
if we blow the whistle
on this guy...

1095
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:32,328
I know. I understand.
...and he's innocent
and we can't make the story...

1096
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:34,124
Then he realizes
that you're, you know,

1097
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:37,219
you're a pushy little phony
who's been playing him
for a sucker

1098
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:39,660
and he dumps you,
you know. I get it.

1099
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:41,991
All right. All I'm saying,
is that in order to make
an accusation,

1100
00:58:42,063 --> 00:58:43,086
we gotta have proof.

1101
00:58:43,196 --> 00:58:45,594
Especially
about Lord Lyman's son.

1102
00:58:45,763 --> 00:58:47,820
You don't make an accusation.

1103
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:50,225
We can phone in
an anonymous tip.

1104
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:52,919
You know how many crank tips
the papers say the police get?

1105
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,962
You're gonna phone one in
on Peter Lyman!

1106
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,053
They'll hang up on you
mid-sentence.

1107
00:58:57,596 --> 00:58:58,823
Besides,
if the story's true,

1108
00:58:58,896 --> 00:59:00,327
I want to be the one
to break it.

1109
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:01,828
You know
what Joe Strombel said?

1110
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,327
He said,
"Get it first,
but first get it right."

1111
00:59:05,896 --> 00:59:07,021
Happy birthday.

1112
00:59:08,563 --> 00:59:10,052
Wow, thank you.

1113
00:59:10,896 --> 00:59:12,555
What's up?
You look so sullen.

1114
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:15,622
No, I'm not. I just...

1115
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:19,322
I get sad around birthdays.

1116
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:21,328
Oh, yes, well,
I can understand that,

1117
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,828
but I think we're both
still young enough
to enjoy the gifts.

1118
00:59:23,896 --> 00:59:24,987
Come on, open it.

1119
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:26,617
Okay.

1120
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:31,295
Oh, wow, it's beautiful.

1121
00:59:31,396 --> 00:59:32,828
You like it?
I love it.

1122
00:59:32,896 --> 00:59:34,327
Good. Here, allow me.

1123
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:36,317
Gosh.

1124
00:59:37,796 --> 00:59:39,227
You shouldn't have.

1125
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:40,421
I wanted to.

1126
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,257
Hey, hey,
are you crying?
No, I'm too tough to cry.

1127
00:59:45,362 --> 00:59:46,350
Oh.

1128
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:49,827
Though my nasal passages
do become congested
when I'm sad.

1129
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,723
Oh, don't be sad.
It's your birthday. Hmm?

1130
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:55,453
Oh, I wish I could
celebrate with you tonight.

1131
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:57,518
I just have to go out of town
for a few days.

1132
00:59:57,729 --> 00:59:58,717
Really?

1133
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:01,728
Yes, I just have
some business to take care of.

1134
01:00:02,396 --> 01:00:04,419
But we'll celebrate
when I get back, all right?
Okay.

1135
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:08,519
Thank you so much
for the present.
It's beautiful.

1136
01:00:08,596 --> 01:00:10,118
I'll think about you
whenever I wear it.

1137
01:00:10,196 --> 01:00:11,184
(CHUCKLES)

1138
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:14,819
You didn't tell me
it was your birthday!

1139
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:16,657
I'll take you
for a magnificent dinner.

1140
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:18,524
We'll go
to a great restaurant.
Really?

1141
01:00:18,629 --> 01:00:22,584
(STUTTERING) Do you enjoy
the McNuggets thing?

1142
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:26,891
What about Indian food?
Do you like spicy food?

1143
01:00:27,129 --> 01:00:28,891
No, no, it's okay.

1144
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:30,895
I don't really have
much of an appetite.

1145
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:33,824
But you will when
they bring out the prawns
in hydrochloric acid.

1146
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,589
It's fantastic, Sondra.

1147
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:38,794
What's the matter?

1148
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:40,795
What,
are you thinking of Peter?
No.

1149
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,725
I don't know, it's just...

1150
01:00:42,796 --> 01:00:45,261
I wouldn't be surprised
if he asked me to marry him
one day, you know?

1151
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:47,955
You come
from an Orthodox family.

1152
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,427
Would they accept
a serial killer?

1153
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:52,889
That's an expensive present.

1154
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,393
The Lymans are so wealthy.
Yes.

1155
01:00:57,462 --> 01:00:59,223
It was almost
too extravagant.

1156
01:00:59,629 --> 01:01:02,789
I'd better get ready.
I still haven't found
my millionaire yet.

1157
01:01:04,062 --> 01:01:05,050
(SIGHS)

1158
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,628
Oh, God, Sondra, what a mess!

1159
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:12,158
It's starting to add up
against him.

1160
01:01:12,229 --> 01:01:13,991
Bits and scraps
are coming together.

1161
01:01:14,062 --> 01:01:15,460
God, it's you!

1162
01:01:15,663 --> 01:01:18,254
I sensed
you were falling in love.
I escaped again.

1163
01:01:18,362 --> 01:01:21,988
It's just circumstantial junk,
you know. A coincidence
here and there.

1164
01:01:22,062 --> 01:01:24,085
Too much smoke
not to be fire.

1165
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:26,526
Look, I'm sure
you've been wrong
plenty of times.

1166
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:27,755
Not wrong here.

1167
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:31,283
Though I agree
you haven't got enough
to pull the trigger yet.

1168
01:01:31,462 --> 01:01:33,690
If you act prematurely,
not only does he walk,

1169
01:01:33,763 --> 01:01:36,854
your professional credibility
is wrecked,
sometimes for good.

1170
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,862
Oh, I'm sure you want him
to be guilty.

1171
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:40,986
You know, that way you get
your last big scoop.

1172
01:01:41,095 --> 01:01:42,493
I'm beginning to fade.

1173
01:01:42,563 --> 01:01:44,392
Sondra, don't let me down!

1174
01:01:44,462 --> 01:01:46,553
I wish you'd fade for good!

1175
01:01:46,729 --> 01:01:47,888
Get out of my life!

1176
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:49,394
I'm not
cut out for this.

1177
01:01:49,462 --> 01:01:51,985
I should be
flossing molars for a living.

1178
01:01:53,029 --> 01:01:55,723
The bread is... You know,
I can make a meal
just with the bread.

1179
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,694
I can do a whole meal,
just nothing but bread.

1180
01:01:57,896 --> 01:02:00,726
If I ate that much bread,
I'd be 20 pounds heavier.

1181
01:02:00,796 --> 01:02:02,659
See,
I never gain an ounce,

1182
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:06,855
because, you know,
my anxiety acts like aerobics.

1183
01:02:07,129 --> 01:02:08,527
So I get the exercise.

1184
01:02:09,362 --> 01:02:12,055
Thanks for taking me out
for my birthday, Sidney.

1185
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,651
Well, you know,
you're the daughter
that I never had.

1186
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:16,718
Oh, that's so...
No, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1187
01:02:16,796 --> 01:02:18,193
'Cause I never wanted
to have kids.

1188
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:20,892
I didn't.
Because you have kids,
what is it?

1189
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,991
You know, you're nice
to them, you bring
them up, you suffer,

1190
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:25,551
you take care of them

1191
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:30,061
and then they grow up
and they accuse you
of having Alzheimer's.

1192
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:32,186
Could you
ever live in London?

1193
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:35,228
Could I live
in London? No.

1194
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:37,489
And I love London.
Don't get me wrong,
I love London,

1195
01:02:37,563 --> 01:02:39,756
but, you know,

1196
01:02:40,062 --> 01:02:43,790
apart from
the language problem,
I can't take the driving.

1197
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:46,920
Because it, you know,
it's on the wrong side,
and I...

1198
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:49,157
Every time
I drive a car here,

1199
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:51,491
I'm convinced
I'm going to die in a crash.

1200
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:53,817
Sidney!

1201
01:02:53,995 --> 01:02:54,983
What's the matter?

1202
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:56,924
It's Peter.

1203
01:02:56,995 --> 01:02:58,052
You said
Peter was out of town.

1204
01:02:58,129 --> 01:02:59,958
Well, that's
what he told me.

1205
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:01,517
Come on.

1206
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:02,956
What do you mean, come on?

1207
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,188
(STUTTERING)
I ordered prawns.

1208
01:03:05,396 --> 01:03:07,487
Just pay, all right?
Just pay.

1209
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:09,854
What do you mean, pay?
All I do is...

1210
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:12,020
Fine, it's her birthday.

1211
01:03:15,296 --> 01:03:16,353
Come on.

1212
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:18,888
Maybe he's got
another woman on the side,

1213
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,961
and he likes you,
but he's sexually
attracted to her.

1214
01:03:22,262 --> 01:03:23,421
Thanks, Sidney.

1215
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:25,121
Well, why doesn't he have
his chauffeur?

1216
01:03:25,196 --> 01:03:27,162
I don't know,
whatever he's doing,
he must want it to be secret.

1217
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,425
Oh, I told you
he went the other way!

1218
01:04:06,895 --> 01:04:08,486
Can we go home, please?

1219
01:04:08,563 --> 01:04:10,324
It's starting to rain.

1220
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:12,794
(GROANS) I can't believe
he lied to me.

1221
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:16,689
Maybe he's doing
something that he's ashamed
to tell you about.

1222
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:20,627
Maybe he belongs to
one of those clubs, or he's
a cross-dresser or something.

1223
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:22,854
Or maybe
he does folk dancing.

1224
01:04:22,962 --> 01:04:25,394
Oh, I'm sure
it's probably something
that when he tells me,

1225
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,485
I'll just feel foolish
for thinking he lied.

1226
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,791
I'm sure. You know,
not everything in
this world is sinister.

1227
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:32,624
You know,
just practically everything.

1228
01:04:32,696 --> 01:04:35,526
(GROANS) That Indian food
made me sick.

1229
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,084
You hardly touched
your cobra salad.
How can you be sick?

1230
01:04:39,362 --> 01:04:41,123
WOMAN: (SCREAMING) Help!

1231
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:43,855
A woman's been strangled!

1232
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:48,761
Help!
A woman's been strangled!
Help, call the police!

1233
01:04:48,828 --> 01:04:50,817
MAN: Somebody call the police!
There's been a murder!

1234
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,191
WOMAN 2: There's been
a murder upstairs.

1235
01:04:52,262 --> 01:04:53,250
WOMAN 1: Help!

1236
01:04:53,362 --> 01:04:55,351
MAN: Have you got a phone?
Have you got a phone?
Call the police.

1237
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:58,224
Could it be the Tarot Killer?
They found a Tarot card.
It's him.

1238
01:04:58,296 --> 01:04:59,694
I can't believe it!
She lives in this building.

1239
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:01,921
It's him again.
They found the Tarot card.

1240
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:06,393
Elizabeth Gibson,
another short-haired brunette.

1241
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:09,186
(SIGHS) We should have
gone to the police earlier.

1242
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:12,319
Well, you know...
You said that they
wouldn't believe us

1243
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:14,589
and they may not.

1244
01:05:14,962 --> 01:05:18,417
Sidney, it's about time
we show my story to
a real newspaperman.

1245
01:05:19,563 --> 01:05:20,892
By real, you mean what?

1246
01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:22,153
One that's living.

1247
01:05:22,596 --> 01:05:25,357
Vivian's father has a friend
that works at The Observer.

1248
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:29,325
Well, it's very vivid
and rather shocking,

1249
01:05:29,396 --> 01:05:32,226
and there are some
genuine circumstantial
bits of evidence.

1250
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:36,023
But let me give you a lesson
in professional journalism.

1251
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:40,820
No newspaper should
or would ever run this story.

1252
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,051
What? Why?

1253
01:05:43,696 --> 01:05:46,820
It would be
fatally irresponsible
and libelous.

1254
01:05:47,496 --> 01:05:50,428
All you have here
are a number
of titillating speculations.

1255
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:54,989
Flamboyant theories that
tarnish a man, and a
well-known figure at that,

1256
01:05:55,062 --> 01:05:57,620
without a single shred
of substantial proof.

1257
01:05:58,762 --> 01:06:00,921
So his mother
was a short-haired brunette.

1258
01:06:01,062 --> 01:06:02,891
So he came late
for a poker game

1259
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:06,520
and said he was going away
on a business trip
and he got caught lying.

1260
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:11,591
Yes, but who keeps
a Tarot deck under
a French horn?

1261
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:16,419
It's not against the law
to own a Tarot deck,
or keep it wherever you like.

1262
01:06:17,862 --> 01:06:20,158
You'd look
pretty foolish in court
with your accusations,

1263
01:06:20,229 --> 01:06:21,854
and that's
where you'll wind up.

1264
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:25,218
Because he'd have no choice
but to sue you
and the newspaper,

1265
01:06:25,296 --> 01:06:26,421
and he'd win.

1266
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:28,226
And to go to the police?

1267
01:06:29,062 --> 01:06:30,255
I'll come to that.

1268
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:33,489
But first let me
continue my tedious
professorial lecture.

1269
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:37,387
Vivian's dad and I
go way back.

1270
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:39,886
He said you were
a journalism student.

1271
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,651
Hmm.

1272
01:06:42,696 --> 01:06:44,286
You talk about getting a tip.

1273
01:06:44,496 --> 01:06:46,325
Okay, you won't
disclose your source,

1274
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:49,521
but what you have done
is let your imagination
run wild.

1275
01:06:49,663 --> 01:06:50,719
No, no.

1276
01:06:50,795 --> 01:06:54,353
What if I told you
that my source happened
to be a certain Joe Strombel?

1277
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:56,893
The late Joe Strombel?
Yep.

1278
01:06:56,962 --> 01:06:59,394
You mean, before he died
he gave a student reporter

1279
01:06:59,462 --> 01:07:01,791
a major story
and didn't follow
it up himself?

1280
01:07:01,862 --> 01:07:04,556
We didn't say
it was before he died.

1281
01:07:05,695 --> 01:07:07,059
What?
No, it...

1282
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:08,685
He got the story
before he died,

1283
01:07:08,762 --> 01:07:11,194
and then he died
before he could follow it up.

1284
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:16,191
(CHUCKLES) Well,
why did he give it to you?
He didn't know he was dying.

1285
01:07:16,496 --> 01:07:17,655
I don't buy it.

1286
01:07:17,728 --> 01:07:19,285
I knew Joe Strombel well.

1287
01:07:19,629 --> 01:07:21,958
If he'd had a tip
that he considered reliable,

1288
01:07:22,596 --> 01:07:24,619
he would certainly
have pursued it himself,

1289
01:07:24,695 --> 01:07:26,594
from the grave,
if necessary.

1290
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:30,591
What about how Peter
was in the neighborhood

1291
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:32,685
the night
the murder was committed?

1292
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:33,783
(CLEARS THROAT)

1293
01:07:33,895 --> 01:07:36,259
I realize as a student
how exciting it must have been

1294
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:38,954
to think that you were onto
something so spectacular.

1295
01:07:39,095 --> 01:07:40,561
Hey, she is onto something!

1296
01:07:40,629 --> 01:07:42,685
This kid is a bloodhound.
Look at her!

1297
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:46,286
She could sell the story
to any tabloid in town.

1298
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:47,917
Hmm.

1299
01:07:48,862 --> 01:07:51,987
Now that I've preached
on the realities
of accurate reporting,

1300
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:56,085
I want to tell you
how catastrophic
for everybody involved

1301
01:07:56,162 --> 01:07:58,287
it would have been
if you had, say, taken

1302
01:07:58,362 --> 01:08:01,487
the results
of your investigation
to a tabloid.

1303
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:06,386
Today, the police
have apprehended
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

1304
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:09,756
And it most assuredly
is not Peter Lyman.

1305
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:11,489
What?

1306
01:08:11,563 --> 01:08:14,653
Every paper in town
is going to press
with it as we speak.

1307
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:19,256
It was a handyman
named Henry Banks
who has confessed.

1308
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:23,122
Banks is a delusional paranoid
who's given Scotland Yard

1309
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:25,855
information
that only the killer
could possibly know.

1310
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:28,491
He's led the police
to two additional bodies

1311
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:32,393
and his DNA
and a fingerprint
they found check out.

1312
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:35,723
I know
this puts a crimp
in your scoop,

1313
01:08:36,563 --> 01:08:39,324
but Henry Banks is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

1314
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:41,717
Not Lord Lyman's son.

1315
01:08:44,429 --> 01:08:46,224
Well, I can't say
I'm not walking on air.

1316
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:50,323
Oh, Jesus, If I ever catch
that Joe Strombel,
I'll kill him.

1317
01:08:50,396 --> 01:08:52,385
I only hope
Peter forgives me
for what I've done.

1318
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:53,553
For what?

1319
01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:55,561
I lied to him.
I'm not Jade Spence.

1320
01:08:55,628 --> 01:08:59,061
I'm a pushy,
duplicitous, ambitious
college student.

1321
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:00,117
I lied to him,
over and over.

1322
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:02,558
Darling, he lied to you, too,
so it's even.

1323
01:09:02,628 --> 01:09:06,026
His lies pale in comparison
to the enormity
of what I've done.

1324
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:09,585
So marry him
as Jade Spence.
Don't tell him.

1325
01:09:09,662 --> 01:09:12,992
(STUTTERING) You know,
you don't have to be
Sondra Pransky ever again.

1326
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:14,494
Marry him as Jade Spence.

1327
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:17,585
Yeah, but I don't want to
have to get you a
Father's Day gift every year.

1328
01:09:17,929 --> 01:09:22,554
You know, I don't know how to
break this to you, honey,
but you were adopted. Okay?

1329
01:09:22,628 --> 01:09:24,560
Your mother and I,
we were at the orphanage,

1330
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:26,924
we wanted
a handicapped child, and...

1331
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:30,322
Ah, finally.
Just you and I all weekend.

1332
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:31,450
Yeah.

1333
01:09:33,362 --> 01:09:34,918
I thought you'd like it here.

1334
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,459
It's lovely.
Mmm-hmm.

1335
01:09:39,062 --> 01:09:40,721
Peter?
Yes.

1336
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:43,318
I have
a confession to make.
Oh, God, so do I.

1337
01:09:43,828 --> 01:09:45,817
Oh, well, let me go first.

1338
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:47,793
Actually, no,
let me, please,

1339
01:09:47,862 --> 01:09:49,158
because mine's
been bothering me all day.

1340
01:09:49,262 --> 01:09:50,591
I just want
to get it off my chest.

1341
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:54,425
When I told you I was
going away for a few days
on business,

1342
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,892
I was lying.

1343
01:09:57,728 --> 01:09:59,717
I know.
You know? How?

1344
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,453
Oh, I saw you.
You saw me? No.

1345
01:10:02,795 --> 01:10:05,193
I was at dinner, and...
With your father?

1346
01:10:05,628 --> 01:10:08,822
Actually...
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter. Really.

1347
01:10:09,196 --> 01:10:13,094
The truth is,
that a company my father owns

1348
01:10:13,162 --> 01:10:14,821
is about to merge
with a company
in the Middle East.

1349
01:10:14,895 --> 01:10:16,861
It's a very
sensitive situation,

1350
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:18,622
and the less
anyone knows about it,
the better.

1351
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:20,286
And we just didn't want
the press to sniff it out.

1352
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:21,554
I mean,
that's no excuse, really.

1353
01:10:21,628 --> 01:10:23,958
I'm just very sorry
for the extreme secrecy.

1354
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:27,086
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm glad.

1355
01:10:27,162 --> 01:10:30,889
It's your own
secret information.
That's fine.

1356
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:33,224
So your father took you out
for a birthday dinner

1357
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:34,989
and you saw me.
I mean, how unnerving.

1358
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:37,892
God, I mean, the thing
I hate most in the world
is lying.

1359
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:40,154
Uh-huh.

1360
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:41,852
What?

1361
01:10:43,562 --> 01:10:44,926
Peter...
Yes, Jade?

1362
01:10:46,495 --> 01:10:47,483
Peter...

1363
01:10:47,562 --> 01:10:49,653
Oh, yes.
What did you want to tell me?

1364
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:50,818
Uh...

1365
01:10:50,895 --> 01:10:52,656
Jade, there's nothing
you can tell me that...

1366
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:55,024
My name is not Jade Spence.

1367
01:10:56,062 --> 01:10:57,392
It's not?

1368
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:00,420
No. It's Sondra Pransky.

1369
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:04,654
And my father
is not my father.
His name is Sidney Waterman.

1370
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:06,626
He's a magician
called Splendini.

1371
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,218
I'm a journalism student.

1372
01:11:08,795 --> 01:11:12,989
Don't ask me
what kind of crazy
misinformation we received

1373
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:14,994
to believe you might be
the Tarot Card Killer.

1374
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:19,222
(STUTTERING) I mean,
I didn't know you
at this time. Remember?

1375
01:11:19,695 --> 01:11:22,525
And, of course,
as soon as I got to know you,

1376
01:11:22,595 --> 01:11:24,925
I knew that
it couldn't possibly be true.

1377
01:11:24,995 --> 01:11:27,120
And the police have him now,
so everything's fine.

1378
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:30,026
Of course,
along the route
I fell for you,

1379
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:32,720
and now
I totally blew it, and...

1380
01:11:32,795 --> 01:11:34,193
Who told you this?

1381
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:37,853
Oh, a newspaperman.
He's now deceased.

1382
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:40,656
Very foolish.
He was eager
for his last scoop.

1383
01:11:40,862 --> 01:11:43,385
Oh, I'm so sorry. I just

1384
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:47,084
totally understand
if you never want to
speak to me again

1385
01:11:47,162 --> 01:11:49,025
or if you
don't want to see me...
Miss Pransky.

1386
01:11:49,662 --> 01:11:52,185
Not only am I
not angry with you, but you...

1387
01:11:52,296 --> 01:11:56,489
(LAUGHS) You've
absolutely made my day!
What?

1388
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,926
Just suspecting
that I could be such
an imaginative,

1389
01:11:58,995 --> 01:12:00,620
dramatic fiend.
I love it.

1390
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:01,718
You do?
Yes.

1391
01:12:01,795 --> 01:12:04,454
I think it's one of the
funniest, craziest things
I've ever heard in my life.

1392
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:05,960
I can't wait
to tell the chaps
at the club.

1393
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:07,854
(CHUCKLING)
Peter?

1394
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:09,020
Yes, darling.

1395
01:12:09,895 --> 01:12:12,725
I have to ask you something.
Yes, anything. Absolutely.

1396
01:12:14,495 --> 01:12:17,620
Why did you hide
that Tarot deck
in your music room?

1397
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:23,158
How do you
know about that?

1398
01:12:24,395 --> 01:12:26,759
I was so paranoid. I...
It's crazy.

1399
01:12:26,828 --> 01:12:29,919
But I snuck in.
Oh, dear, it was going to be
a surprise.

1400
01:12:29,995 --> 01:12:32,460
I bought them for you.
They're Victorian Tarot cards.

1401
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:34,494
You told me
you were into
that kind of thing.

1402
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:35,619
What? Oh...
It was gonna be
a gift for you.

1403
01:12:35,695 --> 01:12:38,025
Oh, you're so...
I feel like such an idiot!

1404
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:40,492
Darling, no, no, no,
never mind, never mind.
What a shame.

1405
01:12:40,562 --> 01:12:42,290
Let's forget about it.
No...

1406
01:12:42,628 --> 01:12:43,958
Huh? Let's just...

1407
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:47,856
Now that we've confessed
our sins, let's move on
with our lives, huh?

1408
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:50,327
Really?
Yeah. I want to hear
all about the real you.

1409
01:12:50,795 --> 01:12:52,988
And I assure you in advance,
I'll love it.

1410
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:54,855
(MOANING) Oh, God,

1411
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:58,020
you snuck into
my music room, did you?

1412
01:12:59,895 --> 01:13:01,724
So the reason
why he was skulking around,

1413
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,658
was 'cause he had
this private family business

1414
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:06,058
which is too delicate
to discuss, actually.

1415
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:07,592
Sorry, I don't buy it.

1416
01:13:07,862 --> 01:13:10,760
What?
The man
is a liar and a murderer.

1417
01:13:10,828 --> 01:13:12,487
And I say that
with all due respect.

1418
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,824
Sidney.
Child, I know
what I'm talking about.

1419
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:16,122
Don't call me that, all right?

1420
01:13:16,196 --> 01:13:18,185
Do you remember
when we were out
on the estate,

1421
01:13:18,328 --> 01:13:20,351
I found a clue,
you thought I was nuts?

1422
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:23,326
I thought you were nuts
so many times I can't
recall the exact one.

1423
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:26,520
Do you remember this?
Do you remember this
little item? This clue?

1424
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:29,058
Yes, Betty G.
Yes, Betty G.

1425
01:13:29,162 --> 01:13:32,821
Now, I checked
all the girls
that were murdered.

1426
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:36,356
The one that was killed
the night we saw Peter
on the street, was named

1427
01:13:36,428 --> 01:13:38,894
(CLEARS THROAT)
Elizabeth Gibson.

1428
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:40,685
So?

1429
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:44,023
So Betty
is short for Elizabeth
a lot of times.

1430
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:47,152
Oh, come on, Sidney.
That's a real stretch.
You're reaching now.

1431
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:51,354
Look, supposing you wanted
to rub somebody out
and not get caught.

1432
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:53,724
Nobody wants
to get caught, Sidney.

1433
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:54,783
Look,

1434
01:13:54,862 --> 01:13:58,692
he wants to get rid of
Elizabeth Gibson.
Betty Gibson. Betty Gibson.

1435
01:13:58,762 --> 01:14:00,921
So, there's
a series of murders

1436
01:14:00,995 --> 01:14:04,392
with a guy that's got
a real style. A Tarot card.

1437
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:06,087
They said
he was a total maniac.

1438
01:14:06,162 --> 01:14:09,252
He buys a Tarot deck
and let's say he hides it.

1439
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:12,193
Hypothetically,
he hides it, let's say,
in a music room.

1440
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,557
Let's say he hides it in,
let's say, a French horn.
Oh, Sidney.

1441
01:14:14,628 --> 01:14:17,423
In a French horn!
I'm losing patience with you.

1442
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,654
I'm not saying the guy
did all the murders.

1443
01:14:19,728 --> 01:14:22,353
I'm saying that he just did
Elizabeth Gibson,

1444
01:14:22,428 --> 01:14:26,520
then folded it into the series
of the Tarot Killer
so he wouldn't get caught.

1445
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,891
Henry Banks
confessed to all the murders.

1446
01:14:28,962 --> 01:14:31,291
Henry Banks is deranged!
He hallucinates!

1447
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:32,349
My God.

1448
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,427
Henry... And you know
those guys like to brag
when they get caught.

1449
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:37,584
Henry Banks, you know...

1450
01:14:37,662 --> 01:14:42,287
Where are you going? The cops
will dump every unsolved
murder on Henry Banks.

1451
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:44,259
They haven't
caught anybody in years.

1452
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:47,223
Peter wouldn't hurt a fly.
Oh, really?

1453
01:14:47,295 --> 01:14:49,091
What about a fly who speaks?

1454
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,154
What?
Yes.

1455
01:14:51,228 --> 01:14:53,319
Why would Peter
kill a prostitute?

1456
01:14:53,662 --> 01:14:55,821
Because it looks terrible
on his resume.

1457
01:14:55,895 --> 01:14:58,520
Who knows what kind of
sordid life this guy has?

1458
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,118
Have you
completely lost your mind?
What is wrong with you?

1459
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,320
Peter being
blackmailed by a prostitute?
It's ridiculous.

1460
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:05,986
What are you putting
in your Metamucil?

1461
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:08,058
You know...
Where are you going?

1462
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:11,356
You don't understand!
It would kill his reputation!

1463
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:13,088
Oh, can you bring
the water out?

1464
01:15:13,162 --> 01:15:14,150
(MUTTERING)

1465
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,160
Can I say one thing?
Can I just tell you one thing?

1466
01:15:18,295 --> 01:15:20,125
Joe Strombel
would not agree with you.

1467
01:15:20,195 --> 01:15:22,593
I don't want to talk about
Joe Strombel, all right?

1468
01:15:22,662 --> 01:15:24,525
Even a great reporter
can be wrong.

1469
01:15:24,662 --> 01:15:26,423
But he's not wrong.

1470
01:15:26,495 --> 01:15:28,018
Blackmail.
I see it all over.

1471
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:29,685
You are a cynical
crapehanger

1472
01:15:29,762 --> 01:15:31,455
who always sees the glass
half-empty!

1473
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:34,619
No, you're wrong.
I see the glass half-full,
but of poison.

1474
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:35,991
And you're gonna wind up
drinking it!

1475
01:15:36,062 --> 01:15:38,823
You don't know anything.
You don't have a reporter's
instincts, okay?

1476
01:15:38,895 --> 01:15:41,258
You're some guy
who vanishes silk
handkerchiefs

1477
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,817
and cuts
people's neckties off.

1478
01:15:42,895 --> 01:15:45,554
Do everybody a favor.
Go back to your card tricks,
all right?

1479
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:53,889
Did you tell her?

1480
01:15:54,361 --> 01:15:55,691
I did. I told her.

1481
01:15:55,762 --> 01:15:59,159
And I made it seem
as though it all suddenly
just came to me.

1482
01:15:59,228 --> 01:16:00,353
I know I'm right.

1483
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:02,693
She just won't listen to me.
She hates me.

1484
01:16:02,762 --> 01:16:03,955
Yeah. I...
You know,

1485
01:16:04,029 --> 01:16:06,620
sometimes, I got to say,
I worry about that girl.

1486
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:10,184
I don't think
I'll be seeing you anymore.

1487
01:16:11,128 --> 01:16:14,118
Well, if there's a scoop

millions of men, didn't she?
She was very sexy.

You know.
Not that you'd know
that from those pictures.

Oh, no, I know, I know.

1528
01:18:49,695 --> 01:18:51,718
She made the mistake
of cutting it off
and dyeing it black.

God knows why.

Maybe it's to please
one of her regulars.

Well, yeah, one for sure.

never use their

Oh, hello, Sidney.
It's Peter Lyman.

Sondra and I
are spending the weekend
at my father's country house.

That's okay. She gave me
this number to call.
May I speak with her?

Yes, one second.

Hi, Sidney.

I got a treasure trove
of information here.

On Elizabeth Gibson.

1551
01:20:05,428 --> 01:20:07,916
She's called Betty. Betty!
She's called Betty.

1552
01:20:08,128 --> 01:20:11,583
And she had some kind of
a long relationship...

1553
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:15,287
A special relationship
with some young guy, Peter.

1554
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:19,794
The last name
doesn't click,
but I'm sure it's the same.

1555
01:20:20,495 --> 01:20:21,756
This is crazy.

1556
01:20:22,762 --> 01:20:25,319
Look, stop making trouble,
Sidney. The case is closed.

1557
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:28,825
Listen, this thing adds up.

1558
01:20:29,228 --> 01:20:33,490
You're alone up there with
a very, very dangerous man.

That's two verys.

1560
01:20:35,495 --> 01:20:38,052
You got to get back to town
right away.

1561
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:40,320
Sidney, if I thought there was
a shred of proof,

1562
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:43,623
I would never let
my personal feelings
get involved, all right?

1563
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:45,251
The truth is,
I'm crazy about the guy.

1564
01:20:45,328 --> 01:20:49,021
I can't keep obsessing
over tantalizing
conspiracy theories.

1565
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:57,726
You know, I'm sure
that he killed her

1566
01:20:57,795 --> 01:21:00,784
and made it look
like a Tarot killing.

1567
01:21:01,128 --> 01:21:04,754
You know,
you don't see it because
you got stars in your eyes.

1568
01:21:05,028 --> 01:21:08,358
Look, I don't...
This is crazy! I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

1569
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:10,087
It's too upsetting for me,
all right?

1570
01:21:10,161 --> 01:21:11,457
Let me have my nice weekend.

1571
01:21:11,528 --> 01:21:12,755
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

1572
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:15,020
Stop putting
these paranoid thoughts
in my head!

1573
01:21:17,261 --> 01:21:18,954
Is Sidney okay?
Yes, yes.

1574
01:21:19,028 --> 01:21:21,688
You know, I love Sidney,
I really do,

1575
01:21:21,762 --> 01:21:24,250
but he's just...
He's got a part missing,
you know, he's crazy!

1576
01:21:24,328 --> 01:21:25,589
Yes, really?
Mmm-hmm.

1577
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:26,685
Like what?

1578
01:21:27,295 --> 01:21:28,420
We'll talk about it later.

1579
01:21:28,495 --> 01:21:30,017
Let me change, okay?
Mmm-Hmm.

1580
01:21:50,794 --> 01:21:52,693
Yes? Oh, yes, sir.

1581
01:21:53,228 --> 01:21:57,285
Yes. My daughter
is in the country
with Mr. Lyman.

1582
01:21:57,361 --> 01:22:00,486
And I'm gonna
be driving up there later
and she asked me

1583
01:22:00,562 --> 01:22:03,789
if I could pick up her red
cashmere sweater. She thinks
she left it upstairs.

1584
01:22:03,861 --> 01:22:04,952
Red cashmere?

1585
01:22:05,028 --> 01:22:07,654
Yes, it's a red sweater.
It's a kind of a red,
tomato red,

1586
01:22:07,728 --> 01:22:09,784
like a fire engine.
A red. A rouge.

1587
01:22:09,861 --> 01:22:12,657
I understand, sir. Red.
Yes, yes.

1588
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:14,557
I'll see if I can find it.

1589
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:20,258
Sir?

1590
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:23,452
(STUTTERING) Oh, I was just
checking out the Stradivarius.

1591
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:29,856
I play a few pieces myself
on the violin. Prokofiev
and Bartok, the Hot Canary...

1592
01:23:29,928 --> 01:23:33,224
But Mr. Lyman is the
only person to have the
combination to that room.

1593
01:23:33,295 --> 01:23:36,227
Yes, but he wanted
to share it with me
because, you know,

1594
01:23:36,295 --> 01:23:37,760
in case something happened,

1595
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:39,759
you know,
life is very capricious.

1596
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:43,419
A stroke, a sudden embolism
or lightning...
You know I...

1597
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:45,784
Darling, I love you.
I mean that sincerely.

1598
01:23:45,861 --> 01:23:49,157
You're a wonderful woman,
you're a tremendous servant
and a credit to your race.

1599
01:23:49,228 --> 01:23:51,421
And I mean that. From
the bottom of my heart
I say that to you.

1600
01:23:51,495 --> 01:23:53,017
I notice you didn't
get the red sweater.

1601
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:54,753
She probably left it
in another bedroom.

1602
01:23:54,827 --> 01:23:57,020
You know,
she's got a little problem
with promiscuity.

1603
01:23:57,094 --> 01:23:58,253
But...

1604
01:23:58,461 --> 01:24:01,688
So, I'll be going.
I'll call you.
We'll have lunch.

1605
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:14,326
Mr. Lyman, sir, Mr. Spence
has been here and he's
been into the music room.

1606
01:24:15,094 --> 01:24:16,390
What do you mean?

1607
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:18,650
A most unusual
sequence of events.

1608
01:24:18,727 --> 01:24:20,989
Mr. Spence came by
looking for his
daughter's sweater.

1609
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:22,550
Said she'd requested it.

1610
01:24:22,628 --> 01:24:24,855
Next thing I knew,
he was in the music room.

1611
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:27,849
Sir, I think
he'd been drinking,
from his behavior.

1612
01:24:28,794 --> 01:24:31,090
Yes, yes.

1613
01:24:31,694 --> 01:24:34,286
Yes. Okay, Margaret,
thank you. Goodbye.

1614
01:24:35,428 --> 01:24:36,587
Is everything okay?

1615
01:24:36,661 --> 01:24:39,526
Yes.
Yes, it will be.

1616
01:25:54,627 --> 01:25:57,616
It's so nice
to be out here with you,
just away

1617
01:25:58,627 --> 01:26:01,059
from the rest of the world
and...
Hmm.

1618
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:05,617
Yes, I often
come out here to read and,
well, and fish.

1619
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:07,183
There's trout in the lake.

1620
01:26:16,094 --> 01:26:17,616
What are you thinking about?

1621
01:26:18,794 --> 01:26:20,385
You really want to know?
Yes.

1622
01:26:22,894 --> 01:26:25,553
Just how ironic life is,
and tragic.

1623
01:26:26,094 --> 01:26:27,355
Why?

1624
01:26:27,928 --> 01:26:30,519
Well, that I met you
by rescuing you from drowning

1625
01:26:31,328 --> 01:26:33,157
and found you
totally enchanting

1626
01:26:34,295 --> 01:26:37,749
and now we've come full cycle
and, alas, you're going
to have to drown.

1627
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:41,885
What?

1628
01:26:42,328 --> 01:26:45,419
Oh, I imagine by now
Sidney's confirmed
that I killed Betty Gibson.

1629
01:26:45,494 --> 01:26:48,086
I mean, in my own defense,
there really was
no other way out.

1630
01:26:49,128 --> 01:26:51,424
At first I managed
to hide my identity from her,

1631
01:26:51,494 --> 01:26:53,653
but I saw her too many times
over the years

1632
01:26:54,928 --> 01:26:56,689
and she learned who I was,
and...

1633
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,387
Well, it became
a constant demand for money

1634
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:01,688
and I just
could not let that go on,
could I?

1635
01:27:02,727 --> 01:27:04,716
I mean, my whole life
and career

1636
01:27:04,794 --> 01:27:07,624
would be
just hostage to her
moods at all times.

1637
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:12,089
So, I studied
the Tarot case,

1638
01:27:12,161 --> 01:27:14,490
I rehearsed my plan,
and, well, you know the rest.

1639
01:27:14,594 --> 01:27:16,492
If you do something to me,
Sidney's gonna find out!

1640
01:27:16,561 --> 01:27:17,686
He'll tell someone.

1641
01:27:17,761 --> 01:27:20,319
No, no, no.
You see, you will go
in a boating accident,

1642
01:27:20,395 --> 01:27:22,088
and Sidney will go
later tonight.

1643
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:24,686
No one knows
of your relationship with him,

1644
01:27:25,128 --> 01:27:27,650
because, after all,
you're not actually father
and daughter, are you?

1645
01:27:28,395 --> 01:27:31,451
And no one will think twice
to investigate the death
of some obscure vaud...

1646
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:32,754
Are you listening?

1647
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:34,924
No one will think twice
to investigate the death

1648
01:27:34,994 --> 01:27:38,551
of some obscure vaudevillian
called Splendini, who is
really a stranger to me.

1649
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:40,318
Help!

1650
01:27:40,395 --> 01:27:42,156
Help! Someone help me!

1651
01:27:49,094 --> 01:27:50,753
(CHUCKLES)

1652
01:27:51,094 --> 01:27:52,684
Yes, very quiet, isn't it?

1653
01:27:55,994 --> 01:27:58,017
This is the advantage
of a private lake.

1654
01:28:02,128 --> 01:28:04,094
Get off me!
Get off me!

1655
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:05,149
(GRUNTS)

1656
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,153
Get off me!
Come...

1657
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:38,020
(TIRES SCREECHING)

(PANTING)

1661
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:28,053
(FEIGNING CRYING)
Yes, police.

1662
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:33,125
Yes, this is Peter Lyman.
I need the police immediately.

1663
01:29:33,694 --> 01:29:35,683
At the Lyman estate.

1664
01:29:36,195 --> 01:29:39,786
There's been
a terrible boating accident.
A woman has drowned.

1665
01:29:39,861 --> 01:29:41,554
It's awful.
Please come right away.

1666
01:29:41,627 --> 01:29:43,116
Thank you. Thank you.

1667
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:47,824
(SIGHS)

1668
01:29:50,028 --> 01:29:51,721
They think they know
where the body is.

1669
01:29:52,928 --> 01:29:54,393
I'm so sorry, sir.

1670
01:29:57,561 --> 01:29:59,289
When last I saw her,
she...

1671
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:05,516
She just said she wanted
to go out there to
communicate with nature.

1672
01:30:07,061 --> 01:30:08,993
Just to think
she wanted some
peace and quiet and...

1673
01:30:09,427 --> 01:30:11,450
She wasn't depressed,
or anything like that,
was she, sir?

1674
01:30:11,527 --> 01:30:12,515
God, no. No.

1675
01:30:12,861 --> 01:30:15,054
I mean, unless she was
keeping it from me.

1676
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,987
You heard no cries for help?

1677
01:30:17,061 --> 01:30:20,515
No! No,
I was listening to music
in here, damn it.

1678
01:30:21,228 --> 01:30:22,818
(SIGHS) It's just so ironic.

1679
01:30:22,894 --> 01:30:24,019
Because the way
I first met her

1680
01:30:24,094 --> 01:30:26,321
I rescued her
from drowning
in our club pool.

1681
01:30:26,394 --> 01:30:28,883
And she was a very,
very weak swimmer.

1682
01:30:29,627 --> 01:30:30,786
SONDRA: Hello?

1683
01:30:32,061 --> 01:30:34,549
I was faking it at the pool
to get your attention.

1684
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:37,985
Actually, I used to be
captain of the Brooklyn
Community Swim Team.

1685
01:30:52,861 --> 01:30:54,417
Fascinating observation.

1686
01:30:54,594 --> 01:30:57,186
Lyman lost a cufflink
at the flat of a prostitute,

1687
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,726
who was later killed
by the Tarot Card Killer.

1688
01:31:00,894 --> 01:31:04,417
Well, this upright chap
certainly enjoyed patronizing
some dodgy women.

1689
01:31:04,894 --> 01:31:08,451
Unfortunately
for Elizabeth Gibson,
she elected to blackmail him.

1690
01:31:09,827 --> 01:31:11,850
It's a beautifully
written story

1691
01:31:11,994 --> 01:31:15,858
and one of the best bits
of investigative journalism
in a long time.

1692
01:31:16,227 --> 01:31:18,194
And this paper
is proud to run it.

1693
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,658
Oh, I have to
share the credit
with Joe Strombel.

1694
01:31:20,961 --> 01:31:21,984
An inspiration,

1695
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,424
who taught me more
than I could ever
explain to anyone.

1696
01:31:24,494 --> 01:31:27,255
And to the late
Sidney Waterman.

1697
01:31:27,994 --> 01:31:29,119
Splendini.

1698
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,988
A nice guy who helped out
with the investigation

1699
01:31:32,061 --> 01:31:34,686
and without whom
I never could have made it.

1700
01:31:36,094 --> 01:31:38,582
Sidney, wherever you are,

1701
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,159
I'll never forget you.

1702
01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:44,390
WOMAN: How did you get here?

1703
01:31:44,794 --> 01:31:45,851
Me?

1704
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:49,654
I couldn't get used to driving
on the goddamn wrong
side of the street!

1705
01:31:49,727 --> 01:31:51,716
(STUTTERING) You know,
I was driving up
to the country,

1706
01:31:51,794 --> 01:31:54,726
and in the United States,
I would have been a hero.
I would have saved her.

1707
01:31:54,794 --> 01:31:55,782
I would have...

1708
01:31:55,861 --> 01:31:58,383
But here, you know...
That's the one drawback
of living in London.

1709
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:01,585
Granted, the theater's better,
there's many good
Indian restaurants.

1710
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:02,854
Well, what did you do?

1711
01:32:02,961 --> 01:32:05,518
What do I do?
I'm Splendini. Magician.

1712

(EXCLAIMS)

1713
01:32:06,727 --> 01:32:08,693
Would you like
to see something?
Oh, yes, please.

1714
01:32:08,761 --> 01:32:10,420
Do we have time
for a card trick?
Yes.

1715
01:32:10,494 --> 01:32:12,187
I believe we have eternity.

1716
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,624
I'm going to show you
a little trick now.

1717
01:32:15,094 --> 01:32:17,855
I just want to say
from the bottom of my heart,
I mean this sincerely...

1718
01:32:18,527 --> 01:32:19,891
I say this
with all due respect.

1719
01:32:19,961 --> 01:32:22,620
You are a wonderful group and
a fantastic group of people.

1720
01:32:22,694 --> 01:32:25,353
I love you and I feel that
coming back from you.

1721
01:32:25,427 --> 01:32:29,757
And you may be deceased,
but you should not
be discouraged.

1722
01:32:29,827 --> 01:32:31,156
Because, you know...

1723
01:32:31,227 --> 01:32:33,785
Don't think of being dead
as a handicap.

1724
01:32:33,861 --> 01:32:35,986
You know,
when I was a child,
I stuttered.

1725
01:32:36,061 --> 01:32:38,458
But with stick-to-it-iveness
and perseverance,

1726
01:32:38,527 --> 01:32:40,493
you know, you can never tell
what could happen.

1727
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:41,993
Now, I want you
to take a card, Alma.

1728
01:32:42,061 --> 01:32:43,321
Go ahead,
take any card you want.

1729
01:32:43,394 --> 01:32:45,088
Just pick it. Pick it.
Go ahead, sweetheart.

1730
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,888
I love you, sweetheart.
That's fantastic.
