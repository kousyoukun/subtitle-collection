1
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:45,179
I MEAN, IT'S SAD
THAT NOT A DAY GOES BY

2
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,248
WHERE WE DON'T STAND
IN FRONT OF A MIRROR

3
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:51,619
AND PASS JUDGMENT
ON OUR OWN SELF-IMAGE,

4
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,555
CONSTANTLY ANALYZING
OUR OWN REFLECTION,

5
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,127
DESPERATELY WANTING
TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE.

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,628
YOU KNOW IT STARTS
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,

7
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,364
AND YOU GET INFLUENCED,
AND THAT INFLUENCE,

8
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,267
IT STICKS WITH YOU
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,237
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING
OVER THERE ALL BY HIMSELF?

10
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,538
WHY DOESN'T HE JOIN
THE OTHER KIDS?

11
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,140
WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOING?

12
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,841
THE JERSEY'S
WAY TOO BIG ON HIM.

13
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,809
ADAM, HONEY, PEOPLE
ARE WAITING BEHIND YOU.

14
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,679
JUST PUT YOUR FEET ON THE--
DON'T STAND ON THE LEDGE.

15
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,281
JUST CONCENTRATE
FOR TWO SECONDS.

16
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,483
NO, JUST-- COME ON!

17
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,584
JESUS CHRIST.

18
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,887
MY PARENTS WERE STRICT.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,291
I HAD NO CONFIDENCE
GROWING UP.

20
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,194
I NEVER EVEN HAD A GIRLFRIEND
OR WENT TO A SCHOOL DANCE

21
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:37,665
OR EVEN HELD A GIRL'S HAND
BECAUSE I WAS TOO INSECURE.

22
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,601
YOU KNOW, ALL THAT STUFF
MATTERS WHEN YOU'RE A KID.

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,204
-SHOW ME HOW HAPPY YOU ARE...
 HOW HAPPY YOU ARE...

24
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:51,745
SOCIETY TELLS US
TO BE HAPPY,

25
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,615
LOVE OURSELVES,

26
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,352
BUT THEN HANDS US
A MILLION REASONS NOT TO.

27
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,188
YOU'RE TOO FAT.

28
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,456
YOU'RE TOO SKINNY
OR TOO UGLY.

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,225
TOO BROKE.

30
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,394
YOUR TEETH
AREN'T WHITE ENOUGH.

31
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,928
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT CAR,

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,597
THE RIGHT HOUSE.

33
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,432
YOUR DICK'S TOO SMALL,

34
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,236
AND YOUR HEAD'S TOO BIG.

35
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,539
I WISH I COULD JUST TAKE
A BREAK FROM IT ALL.

36
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,675
THE COMPARISON TO OTHERS,
WISHING I COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE,

37
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,180
INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING
WHAT I ALREADY HAVE,

38
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:29,717
LIKE THIS UNFINISHED HOUSE.

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,721
I'VE GOT A FIANCÉE WHO'S
WAY TOO GOOD FOR ME.

40
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:38,559
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.

41
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,795
I'M NOT HAPPY
WITH THE WAY I LOOK,
OR THE WAY I FEEL.

42
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,833
I CAN'T EVEN RELATE
TO THE PERSON

43
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,668
I'M STARING AT ANYMORE,

44
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,637
AND EVERYWHERE I GO,
THERE I AM,

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,673
STANDING IN
MY OWN FUCKING WAY.

46
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,377
SOMETHING'S GOTTA CHANGE.

47
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,694
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

48
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,671
IT JUST GOT TO A POINT
WHERE I WAS PUTTING VODKA
IN MY CHEERIOS.

49
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,564
MR. STENSON.

50
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,633
DID YOU GET MY NOTE?

51
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,668
YES, SIR, I SURE DID.

52
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,637
SO YOU REMEMBERED
TO CLOCK IN THIS MORNING?

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,739
YES, SIR,
I SURE DID.

54
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,643
GOOD, GOOD, WELL, LET'S--
LET'S HOPE YOU'VE LEARNED
YOUR LESSON.

55
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,779
YES, SIR.
I SURE DID.

56
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,283
"YES, SIR,
I-- I SURE DID."

57
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,752
THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL YOU GOT
TO BRING TO THE PARTY?

58
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:17,358
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

59
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,728
THIS IS A PHONE JOB,
NOT A FUN JOB,

60
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,498
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO
SOME DIALING AND TALKING

61
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,033
IN ORDER TO BECOME
SUCCESSFUL.

62
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,603
YOU-- YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT,
DON'T YOU?

63
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,573
OKAY. WELL, THAT'S A BIG
FIRST STEP, DON'T YOU THINK?

64
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,708
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

65
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,378
WHAT IS IT
IN THE UNIVERSE

66
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,713
THAT THE MORE YOU TAKE
AWAY FROM IT,

67
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,549
THE BIGGER IT GETS?

68
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,855
A HOLE.

69
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,590
YOU KEEP DIGGING.

70
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,892
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU WANT
TO START FUCKING DIALING.

71
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,561
OKAY?

72
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,034
START FUCKING DIALING.

73
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,781
HEAVENLY FATHER,
WE THANK YOU FOR THIS BOUNTY.

74
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,417
WE THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD
WE ARE ABOUT TO PARTAKE,

75
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,753
AND THOSE WHO SERVE IT.

76
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,456
WE THANK YOU, LORD,
FOR ADAM AND SARA

77
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,958
TO BEING HERE
WITH US TONIGHT,

78
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:30,631
AND WE ASK YOU TO BLESS THEM
IN THEIR NUPTIALS COMING UP,

79
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,100
AND WE ASK YOU TO,
MAYBE, HELP ADAM

80
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,769
ACTUALLY GET HIS HOUSE DONE
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

81
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,740
IN YOUR NAME, AMEN.

82
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,376
WELL, JOKE'S THERE,
YOU KNOW?

83
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,078
YOU GOTTA TAKE IT.

84
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:07,100
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

85
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,604
WELL, THANK YOU, HON,
IT IS STORE BOUGHT,

86
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:13,807
'CAUSE I CAN'T COOK FOR SHIT,
AND I NEVER COULD.

87
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,777
YEAH.
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M SO SKINNY?

88
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,413
ADAM.

89
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,882
IT'S BETTER THAN BEING FAT,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

90
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,851
I ALWAYS TOLD THE BOY
TO EAT MORE.

91
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,488
I SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
GROWING UP, DIDN'T I?

92
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,124
FROM THE TIME
HE WAS A TODDLER,
HE SHOULD HAVE EATEN MORE.

93
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,693
HUH?

94
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,198
ADAM, YOU WERE JUST
REALLY PICKY AS A CHILD.

95
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,035
I-- I REALLY WASN'T
THAT PICKY, MOM.

96
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,871
WELL, I DID MY BEST.

97
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,778
WE'RE A PICKY FAMILY.

98
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,614
MIGHT AS WELL
KIND OF KNOW THAT
COMING IN, RIGHT?

99
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,660
WELL, I AM, LIKE,
BEYOND EXHAUSTED.

100
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,165
ARE YOU HUNGRY, ADAM?

101
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,568
I'M STARVING.
THAT FOOD--

102
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:18,939
I MEAN, I KNOW
YOUR MOM MEANT WELL,
BUT IT WAS DISGUSTING.

103
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,078
WHEN DID YOU START
DRINKING WHOLE MILK?

104
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,714
IT TASTES LIKE CREAM.

105
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,551
STOP.

106
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,520
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

107
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,023
HMM?

108
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,563
OKAY, ADAM, CLEARLY
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

109
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,566
THERE'S NOTHING--

110
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,200
OKAY?

111
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:51,238
I'M NOT JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND TALK TO MYSELF ALL NIGHT,

112
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,541
BECAUSE THAT ARGUMENT
THAT WE HAD AT DINNER--

113
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,543
I REALLY DON'T WANNA
DO IT NOW.

114
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,718
DO YOU THINK I WOULD
LOOK BETTER IF I PUT
SOME MUSCLE ON?

115
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:08,288
I DON'T KNOW, ADAM.

116
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,658
I DON'T KNOW.
ANYBODY WOULD LOOK BETTER.

117
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,696
-TO THE GYM.

118
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,031
YOU DON'T HAVE
A GYM MEMBERSHIP, ADAM.

119
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,168
YOU DO.

120
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,394
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE SPOILING
YOURSELF WITH CHEMICALS

121
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,996
THAT YOU'RE
NOT EVEN AWARE OF,

122
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,065
AND IT'S JUST A LOT
BETTER FOR YOUR BODY.

123
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,408
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO THIS WEEKEND?

124
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,779
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

125
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,715
WE COULD GO

126
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,817
OKAY.
 OKAY.

127
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,318
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A MOVIE IN A WHILE.

128
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,956
HERE YOU GO.

129
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,425
YOUR FAVORITE.

130
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,861
-THANK YOU.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

131
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,033
HOW WAS THE GYM
LAST NIGHT?

132
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,336
-IT WAS GOOD.

133
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,038
GOOD.

134
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,444
DO YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

135
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,147
NO, I MEAN, MAYBE WE COULD
TALK ABOUT IT LATER?

136
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,851
OKAY.

137
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,119
I THINK WE SHOULD, THOUGH.

138
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,727
DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING ELSE?

139
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,929
I HAVE FRENCH TOAST
IF YOU WANT IT.

140
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,298
NO, I'M JUST NOT
REALLY HUNGRY, I MEAN--

141
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,001
-SORRY.
-IT'S OKAY.

142
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,005
-HAVE A GOOD DAY.
-THANKS.

143
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,307
-BYE, I LOVE YOU.
-I LOVE YOU, TOO.

00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,866
DO YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY
NEITHER ONE OF YOU IDIOTS

160
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,068
EVER GETS FUCKING LAID?

161
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,270
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
YOU LOOK.

162
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,806
WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS,
THE DANNY BONADUCE LINE

163
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,274
AT JC PENNEYS?

164
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,943
CAUSE IT'S A LOOK,

165
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,079
BELIEVE ME, IT WORKS
FOR YOU, MY FRIEND.

166
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,149
NOW YOU-- WHAT'S YOUR
FUCKING DEAL HERE?

167
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,516
WHAT'S WITH
THE FUCKING BEARD?

168
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,419
THIS IS SOME HOMAGE
TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN?

169
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,321
ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD
A MUCH LONGER BEARD, SIR,

170
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,924
SO CAN'T REALLY
BE AN HOMAGE.

171
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,093
YOU'RE AN EXPERT
ON LINCOLN, ARE YOU?

172
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,830
OH, GREAT.
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HIM MYSELF.

173
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,331
TELL ME SOMETHING,
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE

174
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:22,402
OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S HANDS
IN THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL?

175
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,005
THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF HIS HANDS, MY FRIEND,

176
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,140
ARE THE FACT
THAT DANIEL FRENCH,

177
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,342
THE SCULPTOR, DID HIS
HOMEWORK ON LINCOLN,

178
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,544
LINCOLN WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE A NEED

179
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,581
FOR FEDERAL FUNDING
FOR THE DEAF.

180
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,917
SO HE SHAPED HIS HANDS
IN HIS INITIALS,

181
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,321
IN SIGN LANGUAGE, A.L.,

182
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,291
THAT, OF COURSE,
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND
SOMEWHERE ONLINE.

183
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,559
YOU JUST MUST HAVE
MISSED THAT CHAPTER.

184
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,028
-YEAH.
-IT'S A BLACK MERCEDES.

185
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,496
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
WHERE IT'S PARKED.

186
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,166
LAST TIME IT HAD A REAL
VANILLA FUNKY SMELL TO IT.

187
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,103
LET'S GO WITH SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE FRUITY, SHALL WE?

188
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,305
-YOU HAVE IT.
-YEAH, I GOT YOU.

189
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,274
WHAT A FUCKING
PSYCHOPATH, HUH?

190
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,409
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK.

191
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,543
HUH?
-LUNCH.

192
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,644
-OKAY.
-SEE YA.

193
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,147
-I'LL BE BACK.
-OKAY.

194
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,451
IS THAT YOUR LUNCH?

195
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,486
YEAH, I'M NOT
REALLY HUNGRY.

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,289
HOW YOU GONNA GET BIG
IF YOU DON'T EAT?

197
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,191
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE

198
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,893
JUST RUINS MY APPETITE.

199
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,428
DO YOU WANT SOME SALAD?

200
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,462
NO.

201
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,231
MY MOM MADE IT.

202
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,499
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MOVED
BACK IN WITH YOUR MOM.

203
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,501
I DIDN'T MOVE
BACK IN WITH MY MOM.

204
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,004
I'M TEMPORARILY
STAYING THERE, DICKMUNCH.

205
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,111
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA
GET SHREDDED,

206
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,581
YOU GOTTA EAT
LIKE A LION.

207
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,418
LIONS EAT RED MEAT, IDIOT.

208
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,653
NOT ALL OF THEM.

209
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,222
YES, ALL OF THEM.

210
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,418
WELL, YOU LOOK
REAL GOOD, BRO.

211
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,487
YEAH, MAN, I GOT
THE NATIONALS COMING UP.

212
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,722
HOW MANY WEEKS UP?
 12 WEEKS, MAYBE.

213
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,158
12 WEEKS. I GOTTA GET READY.
IT'S TIME TO STEP IT UP.

214
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,128
-I GOT YOU. WHAT YOU
LOOKING TO GET?

215
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,663
-THE USUAL MAN,
YOU TELL ME.
-ALL RIGHT, WELL, SHIT, MAN.

216
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,565
YOU CAN DRY OUT.
YEAH, EXACTLY.

217
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,434
TURN AROUND,
LET ME SEE YOUR BACK.

218
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,169
OH, NICE,

219
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,405
COOL, COOL, COOL, COOL.
LET ME SEE THAT MID-SECTION.

220
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,340
OKAY, YEAH,
THAT'S FINE.

221
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,310
-IT'S TIME WE GO AHEAD
AND GET IT UP.
-SWELL IT UP.

222
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,712
SHIT, YOU READY TO BLAST OFF?
HERE'S WHAT I GOT, MAN.

223
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,148
LET ME KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU GOT GOING,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

224
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,349
-THANK YOU, YEAH.
-AND THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD
AND GET IT CRACKING,

225
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,352
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

226
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,433
ARE YOU STILL TOO SKINNY?

227
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,037
GO TO WEIGHTGAINMETHOD.COM
AND GET ACCESS

UM, MR. LOUIS?

PICK IT UP, PLEASE.

234
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,132
THE PHONE.

235
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,737

WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD

239
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,648

00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,008
I RUN THIS SHOW.

280
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,843
YOU HAVE STAGE FRIGHT, BRO?

281
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,450
HEY!

00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:30,262

00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,798
HEY, ETHAN.

00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:38,971
YIKES.
WHOA, DUDE,
YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

285
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,741
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
JUST HAD SEX WITH A TURD.

286
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,242
NICE ONE.
I'M FINE.

287
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,613
JESUS.

288
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,248
YOU LOOK HORRIBLE.
ARE YOU ILL?

289
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,018
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, PAL,
YOU BETTER NOT GET ME SICK.

290
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,053
YOU GET ME SICK
AND I WILL KILL YOU,

291
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,022
AND THEN I WILL
FUCKING FIRE YOU.

292
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,257
YOU PROBABLY
SHOULD FIRE HIM FIRST,
AND THEN KILL HIM.

293
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,293
YEAH, I'M NOT EVEN
SICK, SIR, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET TO WORK.

294
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:04,664
-BECAUSE YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T FIRE HIM--

295
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,332
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM,
AND THEN FIRE HIM.

296
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:09,101
NO, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.
IF I HAVE A GALLON OF GASOLINE

297
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,704
THAT I DUMP
OVER HIS FUCKING HEAD
AND THEN IGNITE IT,

298
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,207
-I COULD DO JUST THAT,
COULDN'T I?
-YEAH.

299
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,878
CHECK, PLEASE.
GO. LET'S GO. OUT!
OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT.

300
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,713
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE REST OF THESE
PEOPLE INFECTED.

301
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,381
-IT'LL BE COUNTED
AS A SICK DAY.
-ALL RIGHT.

302
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,251
FEEL BETTER.
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S GOING AROUND.

303
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:28,354
I WOKE UP TODAY,
I HAVE A LITTLE CONGESTION
MYSELF, SIR.

304
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,822
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING AROUND?

305
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,724
ASSHOLEISM.

306
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,861
I THINK YOU'VE CAUGHT A VERY,
VERY, VERY, SEVERE CASE OF IT.

307
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,696
COME WITH ME.

308
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,220
HOW YOU FEELING?

309
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,155
NOT GREAT,
BUT I'LL LIVE.

310
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,925
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO THE GYM?

311
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:10,196
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I FIGURE
I'LL SWEAT OUT WHATEVER
THIS FLU IS.

312
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,932
I HEAR RESTING WORKS, TOO.

313
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,915
HEY, HEY, BUDDY.

314
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,150
EXCUSE ME,
I'LL GET THE DOCTOR.

315
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,819
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

316
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:42,054
YOU HAD SOME KIND
OF ACCIDENT.

317
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:46,458
-OKAY, GOOD, MR. STENSON.
YOU'RE AWAKE.

318
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,160
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

319
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,396
HEAD IS KILLING ME.

320
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,464
BECAUSE YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS
FOR SO LONG WE'RE GONNA

321
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,034
KEEP YOU FOR AN EXTRA NIGHT,
JUST TO BE SAFE.

322
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,137
I SHOULD FINISH
HIS CHECK UP.

323
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,940
I'M GONNA NEED A QUICK
FEW MINUTES ALONE WITH ADAM,

324
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,909
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT?

325
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,811
SURE.

326
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,184
ARE YOU WARM ENOUGH?

327
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,252
YEAH.

328
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,991
SORRY.

329
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:21,127
-WON'T BE LONG.
-THANK YOU.

330
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:29,869
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

331
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,404
NO, NOT REALLY.
I WAS--

332
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,574
I WAS AT HOME
AND, UM, I DON'T--

333
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,945
YOU FAINTED.
IT WAS THE RESULT
OF HAVING A HIGH FEVER.

334
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,480
THE HIGH FEVER WAS CAUSED
BY AN INFECTION

335
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,083
IN YOUR RIGHT
GLUTEUS MINOR.

336
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,585
THAT'S YOUR RIGHT
BUTT CHEEK.

337
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:51,390
THAT TYPE OF INFECTION
IS ALSO CALLED AN ABSCESS.

338
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,393
WE USUALLY SEE THAT IN SOMEONE
WHO'S INJECTED THEMSELVES

339
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,594
WITH A DIRTY NEEDLE.

340
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,364
ADAM, PLEASE, HEY,
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

341
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,032
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
LOOK AT ME.

342
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,333
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

343
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,468
-LOOK AT ME.
!

344
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,136
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?

345
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,406
HUH? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
SHIT EVERYWHERE, ADAM?

346
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,575
YOU'VE BEEN
SHOOTING STEROIDS.

347
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,945
YOUR WIFE TOLD US.
SHE ALSO COVERED FOR YOU,

348
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:18,985
WHICH IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
BUT I THOUGHT I'D KEEP
THIS DISCREET.

349
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:24,490
YOU COULD HAVE DIED.

350
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:29,028
LISTEN, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU
HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY,

351
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,931
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU
IN THIS HOSPITAL AGAIN.

352
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,466
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

353
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,535
YES, SIR.

354
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,038
OKAY, GOOD.

355
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,140
WELL, ENJOY THE VISIT
WITH YOUR FAMILY,

356
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,975
AND TRY AND GET SOME REST.

357
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,211
THEY CAN TAKE YOU HOME
IN THE MORNING.

358
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,495
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

359
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,365
I DON'T.

360
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,667
I KNEW THAT YOU HAD TO LEARN
YOUR FUCKING LESSON,

361
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,538
BUT ADAM, WHAT THE FUCK
WERE YOU THINKING, HUH?

362
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,007
WHAT THE FUCK
WERE YOU THINKING?

363
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,044
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT ABOUT ME, ADAM?

364
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,279
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR FUCKING FAMILY?

365
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:23,382
YOU, YOU SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

366
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,318
YOU DID, AND I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUCK
YOU WERE THINKING,

367
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,054
I DON'T, ADAM.

368
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,658
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T SAY ANYTHING,

369
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,693
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING TO SAY.

370
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,930
YOU ARE DONE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

371
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,999
YOU ARE DONE
WITH ALL OF THAT SHIT,

372
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,935
AND WE ARE TOGETHER
GONNA GO HOME,

373
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,670
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
HAVE A NORMAL LIFE

374
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:47,606
LIKE TWO FUCKING
NORMAL PEOPLE.

375
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,209
OKAY?

376
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,212
AND THAT'S THE THING.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

377
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:58,517
OKAY?

378
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,654
BY THE WAY, I THREW AWAY
ALL OF THAT SHIT OF YOURS
LAST NIGHT.

379
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,175
THE CONSCIOUS MIND
IS A CRITICAL MIND,

380
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,311
AND IT'S A MIND
THAT IS RIGHT NOW,

381
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,447
AND IT'S DECIDING WHETHER
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS RIGHT
FOR YOU OR NOT,

382
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,151
BUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
IS TOTALLY NON-CRITICAL,
NON-JUDGMENTAL,

383
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,487
AND IT'S WHERE YOU'LL SET
GOOD, POSITIVE AND POWERFUL
SUGGESTIONS.

384
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,833
SO YOU LIKE
THAT PROFILE PICTURE?

385
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,837
YEAH, NO, NO,
I JUST PUT THAT ONE UP.

386
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,074
YEAH, AH, NO,
I LOVE PUPPIES, YEAH.

387
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,710
NO, I DON'T, I DON'T.
I LIVE WITH MY MOM, AND SHE--

388
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,645
SHE DOESN'T LET ME
HAVE ANY DOGS, BUT--

389
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,848
OTHERWISE I'D HAVE PROBABLY,
LIKE, SO MANY DOGS, YEAH,

390
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,217
BUT PUPPIES.

391
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,318
YEAH, YEAH.

392
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,189
OH, DUDE, YOU SCARED--

393
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:20,192
BRO, I HAVE PHONE SEX
WITH THIS GIRL

394
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,760
EVERY DAY.

395
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,163
I AM NOT EVEN GONNA
ASK ABOUT THAT.

396
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,468
MAN, DUDE, THIS GIRL,
I'M TELLING YOU, KILLER.

397
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,836
-KILLER.
-COOL.

398
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,438
BRAZILIAN.

399
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,640
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT,
BUT SHE LOOKS BRAZILIAN.

400
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,408
HEY, WELCOME BACK.
WE'VE MISSED YOU.

401
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:39,145
MR. LOUIS HAS BEEN
CIRCLING YOUR DESK.

402
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,547
-I THINK HE MISSED YOU.
-DUDE, THAT'S WEIRD.

403
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:50,656
BOYS, YOU DO REALIZE
THAT WE'RE A TEAM.

404
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:55,561
WE'RE A TEAM.
ALL OF US ARE COMPONENTS
OF THIS GREAT TEAM.

405
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,229
WHAT I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT THOUGH IS,

406
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,431
WHO'S IN WHAT POSITION
OF THE BATTERY.

407
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,567
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BATTERY
IS IN BASEBALL, RIGHT?

408
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,502
THE BATTERY?

409
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,505
-NO.
-THE BATTERY IS YOUR PITCHER,
YOUR CATCHER.

410
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,574
UP UNTIL THIS MOMENT,
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT

411
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,443
WHO IS THE PITCHER,
AND WHO IS THE CATCHER,

412
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,446
BECAUSE IN MY OPINION,
YOU'RE BOTH FUCKING CATCHERS.

413
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,483
SEE, I'M ON THE HILL HERE,
AND I'M THROWING STRAIGHT
FUCKING HEAT,

414
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,518
AND THAT HEAT IS BEING
TAKEN BY THE CATCHER

415
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,187
RIGHT IN HIS FUCKING ASS,

416
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,455
AND IT SMELLS LIKE SHIT
BACK HERE RIGHT NOW, PAL.

417
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,923
-YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?
-MM-HMM.

418
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,626
OKAY. SO STOP SIGNALING
FOR THE CURVE BALL,

419
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,795
WHEN YOU KNOW I WANT
THE FUCKING HEAT.

420
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,301
WOW.

421
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,603
HE MISSED YOU.

422
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:41,940
GET BACK TO WORK.
SEE YOU.

423
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,744
STOP BEING A BABY.

424
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,713
-NO.

425
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,415
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

426
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,819
-OH. THAT DIDN'T HURT.

427
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,787
-YOU'RE SUCH A BABY.
-I KNOW, OOH.

428
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,689
-COME ON,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

429
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,791
IT ACTUALLY REALLY
ISN'T THAT BAD.
IT'S HEALING.

430
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,694
-YEAH, IT LOOKS GOOD.

431
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,930
I THINK I'M GONNA
GO BACK TO THE GYM SOON.

432
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,366
SOON?
-LIKE TONIGHT.

433
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,301
-NO, I FEEL GOOD.

434
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,203
-NO.
-IT WILL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

435
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,405
YOU FEEL GOOD?
YOU CAN'T EVEN SIT DOWN.

436
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,873
-I CAN SIT.
-YOU CAN'T GO TO THE GYM.

437
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,508
-YES.
-UH, NO.

438
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,377
-THE DOCTOR SAID, YOU KNOW--
-THE DOCTOR SAID--

439
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,845
IF I CALLED
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT NOW,

440
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,447
WOULD HE SAY THAT YOU
SHOULD GO TO THE GYM?

441
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,482
-YES.
-I DON'T THINK SO.
STOP IT.

442
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,015
OH, SHIT!
I GOT YOU, MAN, A SPOT, G.

443
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,751
COME ON, MAN, PUSH!

444
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,756
-IT'S 95 POUNDS,
NIGGA, PUSH!
-I CAN'T.

445
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,991
AH!

446
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,628
GET YOUR ASS UP.

447
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,730
YOU HAVE TO BE MORE
CAREFUL, ASSHOLE.

448
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,437
GET UP.
PATHETIC.

449
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,872
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SEEING
YOU HERE A LOT LATELY, MAN.

450
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,741
YOU'VE BEEN HITTING
THAT SHIT PRETTY HARD.

451
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:26,312
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHOWING UP IS ONLY
PART OF THE JOB.

452
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,648
IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK
YOU DO ONCE YOU GET HERE.

453
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,451
SEE, YOU REMIND ME
OF MYSELF.

454
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,586
I USED TO BUST MY ASS, MAN,

455
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,523
AND NO GAINS.

456
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,291
DAY IN, DAY FUCKING OUT.

457
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,694
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

458
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:47,866
ALL THAT CHANGED
THE FIRST MOMENT
I JUMPED ON A CYCLE.

459
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,668
A CYCLE?

460
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,471
YEAH, GEAR.

461
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,072
YOU MEAN LIKE

462
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,775
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT FINA?

463
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,444

00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,489
I GOT AN INFECTION.

469
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,662
YOU TRYING TO KILL
YOUR FUCKING SELF?

470
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:19,331
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU USE DIRTY SHIT.

471
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,534
YOU KNOW WHAT?

472
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,738
I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

473
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:29,074
I'M GONNA PUT YOU

474
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,544
OH, UH, I AM--

00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,785
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.

477
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,121
LOOK, YOU SEE
THE GUY OVER THERE?
DON'T MAKE IT OBVIOUS.

478
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,956
THE GUY OVER THERE
IN THE CORNER.

479
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,930
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S NATURAL?

480
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,800
NO.

481
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,602
GUESS WHO DID THAT.

482
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,745
MAN, FUCK WHAT

483
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,514

00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:12,017
BEING ALL BAD
AND SHIT FOR YOU.

485
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,853
THEY'RE ONLY BAD
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUCK YOU'RE DOING.

486
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,425
BUT IF YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE THEM RIGHT,

487
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,827
THAT'S WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE.

488
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,463
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

489
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,599
IT'S NOT ABOUT
MISTREATING YOUR BODY.

490
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:31,102
IT'S ABOUT TREATING
YOUR BODY.

491
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,444
YOU UNDERSTAND?

492
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,016

00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,723
-YOU KNOW HOW
I FEEL ABOUT THAT.

496
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,159
YOU'RE ALL SWEATY.
CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR SHIRT,

497
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,994
EVERYTHING

498
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,929
-BUT THAT IS JUST SO WET.
-ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

499
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:01,166
-HELLO.

00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,166
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

513
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,235
HOLY SHIT, MAN.
YOU'RE LIKE A PHARMACY.

00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,076
-SORRY, MAN, JUST--

517
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,712
-DON'T TOUCH SHIT.
-FUCKING NEEDLES, MAN.

518
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,747
DON'T YELL AT HIM.
HE STILL HAS TO BUY IT.

YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
TWO SHOTS OF EACH ONCE A WEEK.

537
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:36,127
THAT'S THE LEAST
OF YOUR WORRIES.

538
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,931
THAT ABSCESS SHIT HAPPENED
BECAUSE YOU WERE SHOOTING

00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:01,219
LOOK AT YOURSELF

"DO I LIKE THE WAY I LOOK?"

546
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:06,291

THERE'S NO EXCUSE

613
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:02,187
FOR BEING ANYTHING LESS
THAN STRONG AS POSSIBLE.

614
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,057
STRONGER IS BETTER.

615
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:10,295
I DIDN'T WANT TO INJECT
THIS CRAP INTO MY BODY,

YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

784
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:42,887
PEOPLE WHO TAKE THIS SHIT
WORK TWICE AS HARD

00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,889

789
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,065
FOR EVERY SECOND,
EVERY MINUTE,

790
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,134
AND EVERY HOUR
OF THEIR SESSION.

791

SO THERE'S NO
EASY WAY AROUND THIS SHIT.

00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,015
MAN, I'M SORRY, DOG. I'M FUCKING
TRIPPING.

794
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,751
THAT SHIT WASN'T

795
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:17,655
YOU KNOW WHAT, MY BAD.

796
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,924
LOOK, GO AHEAD,
TAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED.

797
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,292

TAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED.

798
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:23,928
I'M SORRY, MAN.

DO ME A FAVOR.
GO AHEAD, RIP YOUR FACE OFF.

800
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,867
THAT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO,
MAN, FOR YOU LOOKING OUT
FOR ME, DOG.

801
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,770
THAT WAS REAL GANGSTER SHIT

802
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,238
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:42,031
I'M LOW ON GEAR.

925
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,668
SO THIS MEANS THAT THIS
MAY BE YOUR LAST CYCLE.

926
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,035
I'M ALMOST OUT, MAN.

927
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,804
THAT'S OKAY.

928
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:51,408
YOU'RE COMING UPON YOUR PCT
PHASE RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

929
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,810
YOU GET TO KEEP
SOME OF THOSE GAINS,

930
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,845
YOU KNOW, LET YOUR
RECEPTORS RECOVER.

931
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:59,015
THEN WE HIT FULL
ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO.

932
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,651
A MONTH OFF?

933
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:03,787
THAT'S THE WAY
THE GAME IS PLAYED.

934
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,822
MAN, FUCK THAT, MAN!

935
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:11,027
THERE HE IS.

936
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,999
ARE YOU ADAM STENSON?

937
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:17,667
YEAH, I'M ADAM STENSON.

938
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,803
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

939
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,838
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

940
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,740
ANYTHING YOU SAY
CAN AND WILL BE USED

941
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:25,409
AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

942
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:26,876
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

943
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,645
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD
AN ATTORNEY,

944
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,047
ONE WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU.
I'VE READ YOU YOUR RIGHTS.

945
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,449
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

946
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:33,950
YEAH.

947
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,719
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

948
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,527
QUITE THE DAY.

949
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,066
WHAT'S NEXT?

950
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,668
HONEY.

951
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:00,704
NO, I'M-- I'M--
I'M FASCINATED TO FIND OUT

952
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:03,940
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
BE NEXT FOR ADAM.

953
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:08,011
-HONEY.

954
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:11,581
HONEY, WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS WHEN WE'RE AT HOME,

955
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,782
OKAY?

956
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,056
ADAM, WE TALKED
AND WE THINK IT'S BEST

957
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,626
IF YOU COME BACK HOME
WITH US, OKAY?

958
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:24,594
WHAT THE FUCK
WERE YOU THINKING, HUH?

959
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,930
-BOB!
-PULL OVER AND LET ME
OUT OF THIS CAR.

960
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:27,931
-LET ME OUT.

961
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,599
OH, FUCKING RELAX.

962
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:30,934
-MY GOD, ADAM,
YOU'RE SHAKING.
-LISTEN!

963
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,169
PULL OVER AND LET ME
OUT OF THIS FUCKING CAR!

964
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,871
-YES, I WANT--

965
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,740
-FINE.
-LET ME OUT OF THIS
FUCKING CAR!

966
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:38,207
GET THE FUCK OUT!

967
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

968
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,987
ADAM, COME ON, MAN!

969
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,792
ADAM, COME ON, MAN.

970
01:14:58,094 --> 01:14:59,996
DON'T YOU GET IT, MAN?

971
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:03,066
DON'T YOU FUCKING GET IT
THAT WHEN THE SHIT
HITS THE FAN

972
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,868
THAT THE TRUTH
IS THE ONLY THING

973
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,136
-THAT'S GONNA
GET YOU OUT OF IT?

974
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,740
THE TRUTH IS YOU'VE BEEN
IN DENIAL MY ENTIRE LIFE.

975
01:15:10,774 --> 01:15:12,909
-I'M SORRY.

976
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:15,211
OKAY? I'M SORRY.
I LOVE YOU.

977
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,546
YOU'RE MY SON.

978
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,181
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

979
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:21,017
BUT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU
EVERYTHING WE CAN, MAN.

980
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,752
WE DID THE BEST
WE POSSIBLY COULD.

981
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:25,989
THE REST IS FUCKING
UP TO YOU.

982
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,791
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE ON STEROIDS.

983
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:29,926
OKAY? I GET IT.
YOU'RE ON DRUGS.

984
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:32,261
I UNDERSTAND.
I WANNA HELP.

985
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:35,298
EVERYBODY'S ON SOMETHING.
EVERYBODY'S ON A DRUG.

986
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:37,133
WHY AM I THE BAD GUY?

987
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,869
BAD
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT THAT, MAN,

988
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,171
I-- I GIVE A SHIT
THAT YOU'RE GONNA END UP

989
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,940
FUCKING DEAD WITH THIS.

990
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,809
OKAY? THAT IS
MY BIGGEST FEAR.

991
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:47,944
THAT HAS BECOME
MY BIGGEST FEAR.

992
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:50,980
YOU KNOW THAT?

993
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,282
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T FEAR
WHAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL.

994
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:55,151
I DON'T WANNA CONTROL YOU.

995
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,754
OKAY?
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

996
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:59,088
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU--

997
01:15:59,122 --> 01:16:01,157
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

998
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:05,128
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOURSELF,
MAN, LOOK AT YOU.

999
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:09,599
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM, OKAY?
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

1000
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:11,267
SOME PEOPLE
LIVE AND LEARN,

1001
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,902
OTHER PEOPLE
JUST FUCKING LIVE.

1002
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:15,304
AND DON'T TRY AND TELL ME
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

1003
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:18,374
DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE TO GET OUT OF THIS

1004
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,776
BEFORE IT'S TOO FUCKING LATE,

1005
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,845
CAUSE YOU DO!

1006

YOU JUST GOTTA
REALIZE THAT LIFE--

1007
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:28,284
LIFE AIN'T THAT
FUCKING HARD, MAN,
LIFE IS FUCKING EASY,

1008
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,721
IF YOU JUST GET OUT
OF YOUR OWN FUCKING WAY.

1009
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:36,159
IT'S SO EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY THAT, DAD.

1010
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,130
ADAM, COME ON, MAN!

1011
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:55,912
SARA.

1012
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,348
NO, HE'S NOT WITH US.

1013
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:02,351
WE-- YES, BUT HE JUMPED
OUT OF THE CAR,

1014
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:05,188
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS, SO--

1015
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,757
I TELL YA,
I'M REALLY SCARED.

1016
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:10,159
OKAY.

1017
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,262
KEEP YOUR PHONE ON.

1018
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,926
HEY.

1019
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:46,029

1024
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,490
HUH? GET THE FUCK

1025
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:50,226
-LOOK, MAN,

1026
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:51,427
ADAM'S IN TROUBLE.

1027
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,462
ALL RIGHT,
IF YOU HELP ME,

1028
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:56,199
I PROMISE
I WON'T TELL THE COPS
YOU'RE A FUCKING DRUG DEALER.

1029
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,801
HEY, FUCK YOU, MAN.

1030
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:00,536

1031
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,806
LOOK, MAN,

1032
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:05,441
I WAS DOING MY FUCKING JOB.

1033
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,476
YOU WOULDN'T BE

1034
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,278
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,

1046
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:57,226
-IS THAT WHAT THE FUCK

01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,042
-YOU CAN'T.
-KNOCK THAT BULLSHIT OFF.

1078
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:21,310
COME ON,
OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

1079
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:26,049
-FUCK. JUST LEAVE.
-THIS IS NOT YOU, THIS IS
THE SHIT YOU'VE BEEN TAKING.

1080
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,583
LET ME HELP YOU.

1081
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,554
I LOVE YOU, ADAM.

1082
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,297
FUCK!

1083
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,467
WHAT

1084
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,137
ADAM, DON'T HANG UP, OKAY?

1085
01:21:48,171 --> 01:21:50,406
ALL RIGHT.

1086
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:54,310
I WANNA TELL YOU
THAT I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

1087
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:58,681
I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.

1088
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:01,450
EVERY MUSCLE, EVERY BONE,
EVERY ORGAN IS BEAUTIFUL.

1089
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:04,954
EVERY FIBER
OF YOUR BODY IS--

1090
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:08,724
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND IT HAS BEEN
IN EVERY WAY ALWAYS.

1091
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,427
YOU'RE YOU.
YOU'RE JUST YOU.

1092
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,731
LOOK, WHEN I SAW YOU TODAY

1093
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:20,369
IT HIT ME
LIKE A TON OF BRICKS,
HOW BIG YOU'VE GOTTEN.

1094
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:24,207
BUT THAT'S JUST THE THING,
SEE, YOU DON'T--

1095
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,342
YOU DON'T SEE IT, DO YOU?

1096
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,477
YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

1097
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,346
YOU CAN'T SEE YOURSELF.

1098
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:34,717
THE WAY YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SICK.

1099
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:40,723
YOU ARE PHYSICALLY UNABLE
TO SEE YOURSELF THE WAY YOU--

1100
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:46,295
YOU REALLY ARE, YOU--
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR OWN BODY.

1101
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:49,198
YOU HAVE BODY DYSMORPHIA.

1102
01:22:49,232 --> 01:22:52,235
BUT WE'LL GET YOU HELP,
WE WILL.

1103
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:05,414
ADAM?

1104
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:07,216
DO YOU HEAR ME?

1105
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:11,387
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

1106
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:14,790
YOU JUST NEED TO HANG ON.
OKAY, HONEY? JUST HANG ON.

1107
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,027
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,

1108
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:20,996
AND YOUR DAD LOVES YOU,
AND WE'LL GET YOU HELP.

1109
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:28,037
YOU HAVE BODY DYSMORPHIA.

1110
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:30,339
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
GET RID OF IT.

1111
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:35,378
WE'RE SORRY, I LOVE YOU.

1112
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:38,247
YOU'RE MY SON.

1113
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:40,383
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH, OKAY?

1114
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,618
DON'T TOUCH ME.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

1115
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,254
YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF ANYMORE!

1116
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,769
MOM, WHY DID YOU
NEVER SAY ANYTHING?

1117
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:06,109
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1118
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:12,081
I-- I'M SORRY.

1119
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:15,584
HOW COULD I HAVE TOLD YOU?

1120
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:18,621
WOULD IT HAVE
MATTERED IF I HAD?

1121
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:20,556
WOULD YOU HAVE
LISTENED TO ME?

1122
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,595
NO, I DON'T GIVE A SHIT--

1123
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:28,231
-THAT'S BULLSHIT.
-NO SHIT.

1124
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:30,099
ADAM, ARE YOU THERE?

1125
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:33,202
YOUR WIFE TOLD US.
NO EXCUSE FOR YOU.

1126
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,437
ADAM?

1127
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:45,414
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

1128
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:51,287
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1129
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,824
YOU KNOW, AS THEY SAY,
BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP.

1130
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:59,895
WE ARE THE ONLY ONES
IN CONTROL OF OUR DESTINY.

1131
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,431
HEY, ADAM.
DO YOU KNOW THIS?

1132
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:05,434
YOU HAVE BODY DYSMORPHIA.
