homework on Lincoln,

to acknowledge a need

-Yeah.

Not great, but I'll live.

Excuse me, I'll get the doctor.

You're in the hospital.

340
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:42,064
You had some kind of accident.

-What did you do, Adam? -Okay, good, Mr.
Stenson. You're awake.

Head is killing me.

Because you were unconscious
for so long we're gonna

keep you for an extra
night, just to be safe.

I should finish his check up.

347

I'm gonna need a quick few
minutes alone with Adam,

- Thank you.

Do you have any recollection
of what happened to you?

355
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,414
No, not really. I was...

356

I was at home and,
um, I don't...

357
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,954
You fainted. It was the result
of having a high fever.

358
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,489
The high fever was
caused by an infection

359
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,092
in your right gluteus minor.

360

That's your right butt cheek.

That type of infection is
also called an abscess.

362
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,402
We usually see that in someone
who's injected themselves

with a dirty needle.

also covered for you,

[Man on TV] The conscious
mind is a critical mind,

and it's a mind
that is right now,

405

and it's deciding whether what I'm
telling you is right for you or not,

406
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,160
but the subconscious mind is totally
non-critical, non-judgmental,

407
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,487
and it's where you'll set good,
positive and powerful suggestions.

00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,637
Get your ass up.

476
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,739
You have to be more
careful, asshole.

477

[Adam coughs]

478
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,446
Get up. Pathetic.

479
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,882
You know, I've been seeing
you here a lot lately, man.

480
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,750
You've been hitting
that shit pretty hard.

481
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:26,321
But you know what? Showing
up is only part of the job.

482
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,657
It's about what the fuck
you do once you get here.

483
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,460
See, you remind me of myself.

484
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,596
I used to bust my ass, man,

485
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,532
and no gains.

486
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,291
Day in, day fucking out.

487
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,704
Well, guess what?

488
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:47,875
All that changed the first
moment I jumped on a cycle.

489
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,677
A cycle?

490
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,480
Yeah, gear.

491
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,081
You mean like... like fina?

492
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,784
What the fuck do you
know about fina?

493
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,453
I made some.

494
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,921
Wait a minute. Come back.

495
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,525
- You made some fina?
- Yeah.

496
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,093
Get the fuck outta here!
You made some fina?

497
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,830
And what happened?

498
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,498
I got an infection.

499

[Laughing]

500
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,671
You trying to kill
your fucking self?

501
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:19,331
That's what happens when
you use dirty shit.

502
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,534
You know what?

503
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,748
I'm gonna help you.

504
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:29,083
I'm gonna put you
on some clean shit.

505
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,554
Oh, uh, I am... I'm not, um...

506
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:33,945
You scared?

507
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,794
Get the fuck outta here.

508
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,130
Look, you see the guy over there?
Don't make it obvious.

509
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,956
The guy over there
in the corner.

510
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,939
Do you think that's natural?

511
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,809
No.

512
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,602
Guess who did that.

513
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,754
Man, fuck what you heard, man.

514
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,523
Fuck what you heard
about steroids

515
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:12,026
being all bad and shit for you.

516
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,853
They're only bad if you don't
know what the fuck you're doing.

517
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,434
But if you know how
to use them right,

518
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,827
that's what you look like.

519
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,472
That's what you look like.

520
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,609
It's not about
mistreating your body.

521
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:31,102
It's about treating your body.

522
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,444
You understand?

523
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,026
My nigga.

524
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,761
-There she is. How you doing?
-Hi.

525
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,130
Take your shoes off. I
see them on the carpet.

526
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,733
-You know how I feel about that.
-What?

527
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,168
You're all sweaty. Can you change
your shirt, please? Please?

528
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,003
Everything in the
basket is clean,

529
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,987
- but that is just so wet.
- All right, all right.

530
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:01,175
- Hello.
- Hi.

531
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,578
-Can you take your shoes off?
-Sorry.

532
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,013
Kind of the house rule, you
gotta take your shoes off,

533
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,450
so you don't bring the dirt inside.
You get it?

534
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:10,585
- Got it.
- How about now?

535
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:13,455
That's much better. Much better.

536
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,757
- I see you met asshole.
- I did, hello, asshole.

537
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,124
Asshole, this is my girl, Trish.

538

Hi Trish, it's Adam.

539
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,529
No, whatever. Potential client.

540
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,731
Okay, well, go do your thing.
I'll be here.

541
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,600
- Don't mind me.
- All right, come on, man,

542
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:26,825
- let's go.
- Okay.

543
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,176
So, what do you think?

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,244
Holy shit, man. You're
like a pharmacy.

- What the fuck is you doing?
- Sorry, man, just...

548

- Don't touch shit.
- Fucking needles, man.

549

Don't yell at him. He
still has to buy it.

550
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,058
Would you let me handle my
business, baby? God damn.

551
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,727
Don't yell at me!

sorry, I'm sorry.

554
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,734
[Jason] Okay.

So listen, this is
what we gonna do.

556
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,807
Cypionate. Testosterone.

557
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,274
Babe, we gotta go
to dinner soon,

558
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,210
so I want you to
start getting ready.

559
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,245
Okay, all right. Let
me go ahead and finish

560
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,247
handling this business,
baby, all right?

561
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,149
You gotta take down
that serial killer shit

562
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,552
on the walls before I
start cooking again.

563
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,086
- Okay.
- That's scary as fuck.

564
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,512
All right!

565
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,792
This right here is my favorite.

566
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,563
Deca, it's for your bulking
and for your joints.

567
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:33,167
You're gonna take two shots
of each once a week.

568
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,652
-What about an abscess?
-An abscess?

569
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:36,137
That's the least
of your worries.

570
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,941
That abscess shit happened because
you were shooting some dirty shit.

571
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,777
All right? Besides, you didn't
know what the fuck you were doing.

572
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,936
I don't know, man, it's just...

Man, I don't... I don't...

Listen, every time you feeling

00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,223
that queasy-ass shit
you're feeling,

577
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:01,219
look at yourself in the mirror and
say, "do I like the way I look?"

578
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:06,291
Answer, "fuck no," and shoot.

579
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,173
Listen, man, I'm gonna
do you a favor,

580
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:16,343
I had my shots today. I'm gonna
show you how to do it, okay?

581
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,496
-Right now? -Yeah, I'm
about to do it now.

582
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:20,648
You got a problem with that?

583
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:23,918
No.

00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:27,154
One inch syringes.

585
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,781
You're gonna extract one cc.

586
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:32,594
One.

587
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:34,161
All right?

588
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,331
I'm gonna put the
lid back on it.

589
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,734
It pops right off.

590
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:40,992
Discard.

591

time with you?

do this shit again.

get used to it.

Well, look, I was
contemplating this,

but how about you go ahead and
make the delivery for me,

to worry about it, all right?

-You wanna pay for it?

Well, shit, nigga, go ahead
and give me $600 right now.

- $600?

want this or not?

Okay, so, if I do this, um, I

You're gonna do that. My nigga,

787
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:13,971
don't worry about that.

788
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,068
- Dude, what was that about?
- Shh shh.

789
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,137
Was anybody following us?

790
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,005
-I don't know... -was
somebody following you, bro?

791
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,674
- I don't know.
- Were you paying attention?

792
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:43,544
- No, I wasn't.
- Fuck.

793
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,035
Hold on.

794
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:51,217
The whole thing at the gym
was freaking me out, bro.

795
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,953
Shit.

796
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:55,112
Now do me a favor, man,
pack your boy one up.

797
00:56:57,648 --> 00:57:00,527
Come on, dog, I can't fuck with
this shit right now sober,

798
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:02,496
I need to be high.

799
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,188
They motherfuckers.

800
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:10,003
Let me tell you something.

801
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:14,174
What happened today is because some
people were just hating on me, dog.

802
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,677
Just hating on me, for
no reason at all.

803
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:18,111
They mad 'cause
I'm making money.

804
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,980
They're trying to fuck
up my business, though.

805
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,648
You scared the shit
outta me, man,

806
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,116
I don't even know what to think.

807
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,951
Yeah, man, I know.

808
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:26,820
I need to be fucking
high right now,

809
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:28,889
I can't deal with
this shit sober.

810
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:31,925
Come on, man, dude, you packing
that bitch really slow right now.

811
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,118
Come on, dog, god damn.

812
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,722
You're so god damn
slow at everything.

813
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,565
[Coughing]

814
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:49,910
Yeah.

815
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:51,044
That's what I'm talking about.

816
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:54,881
[Sniffs, coughs]

817
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,550
[Coughing continues]

818
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,620
Hey, man, I'm gonna
need more soon.

819
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:01,121
More what?

820
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:04,124
Uh, tests.

821
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,017
I dropped a bottle off
the counter today.

822
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:17,938
Don't be doing more than I
fucking tell you to do.

823
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:20,674
Do you think I'm stupid, man?

824
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:23,877
You do it like I
told you to do it.

825
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:27,147
This shit will fuck you up.

826
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,884
I'm talking about bitch tits,
I'm talking about acne.

827
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:34,254
All that ugly shit.

828
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:38,058
You know what? Let me
tell you something.

829
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:42,896
People who take this
shit work twice as hard

830
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,898
than people who don't.

831
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:46,199
You wanna become a
fucking olympian?

832
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,134
You wanna win a gold medal?

833
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:53,206
They take this shit, and
they work their asses off,

834
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,075
for every second, every minute,

835
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,143
and every hour of their session.

836
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,880
They go balls out.

837
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:02,172
So there's no easy way
around this shit.

838
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,024
Man, I'm sorry, dog.
I'm fucking tripping.

839
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,760
That shit wasn't
even for you, homie.

840
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:17,664
You know what, my bad.
I was wrong.

841
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,933
Look, go ahead, take
whatever you need.

842
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,302
All right? Take
whatever you need.

843
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:23,937
I'm sorry, man.

844
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,740
Do me a favor. Go ahead,
rip your face off.

845
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,876
That's the least I could do, man,
for you looking out for me, dog.

846
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,779
That was real gangster
shit you did earlier,

847
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,247
and I appreciate that.

848
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,973
Real tough.

849
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,245
Yeah, look at you.

850
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,282
My nigga.

851
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:24,130
Mmm.

852
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,231
How's breakfast?

853
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,400
It's all good. These eggs?

854
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,435
They're the same eggs
I make you every day.

855
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,037
Do you want some coffee?

856
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,739
I'm okay, thanks.

857
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,131
What do you wanna
do this weekend?

858
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:40,113
- The zoo?
- The zoo?

859
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,306
-What? -It's so mean.
I hate the zoo.

860
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,887
Well, cause it's mean
locking them up and then...

861
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,923
I told you that.

862
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:52,225
- [Dryer buzzes]
- Hold on a second.

863
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,359
[Sara sighing]

864
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,695
[Adam] I like that dress.

865
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,429
Thank you.

866
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:59,800
I ordered it online. I didn't
think it was gonna fit, but...

867
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,434
- It's pretty cute.
- Yeah.

868
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:04,270
- It's red and bright.
- [Sara chuckles]

869
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,739
Thank you.

870
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:07,073
So, what's your day like?

871
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:08,875
Do you think you'll
be out early?

872
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:12,713
Ah, definitely not being
able to get out early,

873
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:15,782
but, you know, there's more
selling people self-help books

874
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:18,384
that probably need help,
but can't admit it.

875
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,144
I'm getting yelled at.

876
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,027
Are you fucking kidding me?

877
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,962
- What's wrong with you?
- Off! Take off your pants.

878
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,831
What is fucking wrong with you?

879
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:31,849
-And show me that you're not

880
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:32,866
shooting up again! -What?

881
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,802
Prove it to me! Prove it to me
you're not shooting up again, huh?

882
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:40,140
Okay, so, I am doing steroids,
yes, but they are safe.

883
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:41,174
- Those are safe?
- Yes.

884
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,076
I fucking hate you, Adam.

885
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,745
I hate you and you're a liar.

886
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:46,079
Sara!

887
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:47,480
Can you stop?

888
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:49,783
You lied! Don't tell
me to calm down.

889
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,986
Do not tell me to calm down!

890
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,188
Do not tell me to calm down!

891
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,390
Sara... why do... what about us?

892
01:01:57,414 --> 01:01:58,992
There is no us, Adam.

893
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:01,952
There is no us
until you fix you!

894
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:43,103

but I have a special offer today

- Sir, are you still there?
- [Phone clicks]

Okay, great. I have

change your life today.

Uh, it's for 19.95, and I
think you'd really love it.

907
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:17,237
[Man on phone] You
understand me, dog?

908
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:19,572
You a fucking retard
or something?

909
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,843
- I'll find you.
- You'll find me?

910
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:26,279
No, you know what? How about you listen
to me, you fucking piece of shit.

911
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,114
Do you know how many fuckers
like you I deal with

912
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,017
on a daily fucking basis that
show me no goddamn respect?

913
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:35,312
Huh? Do you? Do you?
Hello? Hello?

914
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:38,015
Fuck!

915
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,497
Stenson! What the
fuck are you doing?

916
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:47,167
You're fired! Get out now!

917
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,093
Now, stenson!

918
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,142
Oh, you want a piece?
Go ahead, motherfucker,

919
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,911
take it.

920
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:00,370
Come on, man. I'd love it.
Go ahead.

921
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,318
Hold!

922
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,888
You are making a career
decision right now, my friend.

923
01:04:07,912 --> 01:04:10,423
Follow him and get the fuck
out and don't ever come back.

924
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:13,393
Otherwise you turn to your
cubicle and get on the phone!

925
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:16,286
Or I find myself
a new number 15.

926
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,237
That's what I fucking thought.

927

The rest of you motherfuckers,
get on the phone!

01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:27,677
- Hi.
- Hi.

- Good.
- Yeah?

933
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,401
You look really tan.

934

- Do you like it?
- No.

- No, it's okay.
- Yeah, hmm.

01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:16,469
All right, maybe we
should talk first.

945
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:18,838
We need to talk about things.

946
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:20,506
Later?

947
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,566
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

948
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,625
[Sara sighing]

949
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:53,163
[Sara moaning]

950
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:14,684
[Sara groaning]

951
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,596
- What are you doing?
- [Adam grunts]

952
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:30,943
Adam, ow, ow!

953
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:32,878
Adam, wait, what are you doing?

954
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,514
You're hurting me!

955
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:36,349
Listen to me! You're hurting...

956
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,618
Adam! Stop it!

957
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:40,420
Stop it! Get off of me!

958
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:42,255
What's wrong with you?

959
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,513
What did I do?

960
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:48,285
- Sara!
- [Sara panting]

961
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:23,696
May I help you, motherfucker?

962
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,966
I'm Adam's father.

963
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,503
I want you to stay
away from my son.

964
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,405
Do you know where
the fuck you at?

965
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:33,606
Huh?

966
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,841
You don't have a clue, do you?

967
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,810
Look, man, whatever
you're thinking,

968
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,570
you got this shit all wrong, man, a'ight?
Get the fuck outta here.

969
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,819
You go near my son again,
I'll fucking kill you.

970
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:50,013
You better get the fuck off
my property right now.

971
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:54,360
I'll kill you.

972
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:56,796
You need to get the
fuck up outta here.

973
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,389
Don't threaten me in
my own fucking house.

974
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,532
Hope you make it to the
car, motherfucker!

975
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,907
[Adam grunting]

976
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,588
Man, rack this shit up.

977
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,725
Come on, man, rack it.

978
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:28,561
Look...

979
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,630
Look, man, things are a
bit sketchy right now.

980
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:33,065
-I just thought I'd let you know.
-What do you mean?

981
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,825
Listen, man, my connect
in China just got popped.

982
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:42,041
I'm low on gear.

983
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,677
So this means that this
may be your last cycle.

984
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,045
I'm almost out, man.

985
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,813
That's okay.

986
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:51,417
You're coming upon your pct
phase right about now.

987
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,819
You get to keep some
of those gains,

988
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,855
you know, let your
receptors recover.

989
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:59,024
Then we hit full
another month or two.

990
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,661
A month off?

991
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:03,796
That's the way the
game is played.

992
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,822
Man, fuck that, man!

993
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:11,027
There he is.

994
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,008
Are you Adam stenson?

995
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:17,677
Yeah, I'm Adam stenson.

996
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,812
You're under arrest for
domestic violence.

997
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,847
You have the right
to remain silent.

998
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,749
Anything you say can
and will be used

999
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:25,418
against you in a court of law.

1000
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:26,886
You have the right
to an attorney.

1001
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,654
If you can't afford an attorney,

1002
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,056
one will be provided to you.
I've read you your rights.

1003
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,458
Do you understand?

1004
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:33,959
[Adam] Yeah.

1005
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,719
You're coming with us.

1006
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,527
Quite the day.

1007
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,076
What's next?

1008
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,678
[Mrs. Stenson] Honey.

1009
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:00,713
No, I'm... I'm... I'm
fascinated to find out

1010
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:03,949
what could possibly
be next for Adam.

1011
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:08,020
- Honey.
- No! What's next, son?

1012
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:11,591
Honey, why don't we talk about
this when we're at home,

1013
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,782
okay?

1014
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,065
Adam, we talked and
we think it's best

1015
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,635
if you come back
home with us, okay?

1016
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:24,604
What the fuck were
you thinking, huh?

1017
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,939
-Bob! -Pull over and let
me out of this car.

1018
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:27,940
- What?
- Let me out.

1019
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,609
Oh, fucking relax.

1020
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:30,943
-My god, Adam, you're shaking.
-Listen!

1021
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,178
Pull over and let me out
of this fucking car!

1022
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,880
- Oh, you want out?
- Yes, I want...

1023
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,749
-fine. -Let me out
of this fucking car!

1024
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:38,217
- [Tires screeching]
- [Bob] Get the fuck out!

1025
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,709
What are you doing?

1026
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,987
[Bob] Adam, come on, man!

1027
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,792
Adam, come on, man.

1028
01:14:58,094 --> 01:15:00,005
Don't you get it, man?

1029
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:03,075
Don't you fucking get it that
when the shit hits the fan

1030
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,877
that the truth is the only thing

1031
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,146
-that's gonna get you out of it?
-The truth?

1032
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,750
The truth is you've been
in denial my entire life.

1033
01:15:10,774 --> 01:15:12,918
- Do you even realize that?
- I'm sorry.

1034
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:15,220
Okay? I'm sorry. I love you.

1035
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,556
You're my son.

1036
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,190
You're my friend.

1037
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:21,026
But we have given you
everything we can, man.

1038
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,762
We did the best we
possibly could.

1039
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:25,998
The rest is fucking up to you.

1040
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,800
Look, I know you're on steroids.

1041
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:29,935
Okay? I get it. You're on drugs.

1042
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:32,271
I understand. I wanna help.

1043
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:35,307
Everybody's on something.
Everybody's on a drug.

1044
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:37,142
Why am I the bad guy?

1045
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,879
Bad? Good? I don't give
a shit about that, man,

1046
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,181
i... I give a shit that
you're gonna end up

1047
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,949
fucking dead with this.

1048
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,818
Okay? That is my biggest fear.

1049
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:47,953
That has become my biggest fear.

1050
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:50,990
You know that?

1051
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,292
Well, you shouldn't fear
what you can't control.

1052
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:55,160
I don't wanna control you.

1053
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,763
Okay? I want to help you.

1054
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:59,098
I mean, look at you...

1055
01:15:59,122 --> 01:16:01,166
For Christ's sake.

1056
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:05,137
I mean, look at yourself,
man, look at you.

1057
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:09,609
You've got a problem, okay?
But it's not your fault.

1058
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:11,276
Some people live and learn,

1059
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,912
other people just fucking live.

1060
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:15,314
And don't try and tell me
you don't have a choice.

1061
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:18,383
Don't tell me you don't have
a choice to get out of this

1062
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,785
before it's too fucking late,

1063
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,854
cause you do!

1064
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:24,957
You just gotta
realize that life...

1065
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:28,293
Life ain't that fucking hard,
man, life is fucking easy,

1066
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,721
if you just get out of
your own fucking way.

1067
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:36,159
It's so easy for you
to say that, dad.

1068
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,130
Adam, come on, man!

1069
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:55,912
Sara.

1070
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,358
No, he's not with us.

1071
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:02,361
We... yes, but he
jumped out of the car,

1072
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:05,197
and I don't know
where he is, so...

1073
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,757
I tell ya, I'm really scared.

1074
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:10,159
Okay.

1075
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,262
Keep your phone on.

1076
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,935
Hey.

1077
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:46,029
I promise, I'm gonna
get our boy back.

1078
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,451
[Sobbing]

1079
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,477
Hey!

1080
01:18:37,013 --> 01:18:39,391
Come on, man, open the door.

1081
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:42,185
Come on, man, open the door! I
know you're fucking in there.

1082
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:45,464
Now what the fuck is
your problem, man?

1083
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,499
Huh? Get the fuck
off my property.

1084
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:50,235
-Look, man, I need your help.
-Need my help?

1085
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:51,436
Adam's in trouble.

1086
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,472
All right, if you help me,

1087
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:56,208
I promise I won't tell the cops
you're a fucking drug dealer.

1088
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,810
Hey, fuck you, man.

1089
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:00,545
- What the fuck?
- Wait a sec. Wait a second.

1090
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,815
Look, man, you
gave him the shit.

1091
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:05,450
I was doing my fucking job.
Had you been doing yours,

1092
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,486
you wouldn't be in this
position, now would you?

1093
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,288
That's your problem,
man, you fix it.

1094
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:11,156
-You're right. -Get the
fuck off my property.

1095
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:14,159
Wait. You're right.

1096
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:16,328
Help me save my son, please.

1097
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:19,255
What the fuck do you want
me to do about this, huh?

1098
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:32,368
Well, fuck.

1099
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,322
[Panting] What the fuck?

1100
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:45,357
Calm down, man. We're
