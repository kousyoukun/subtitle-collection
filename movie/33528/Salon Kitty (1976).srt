Heil Hitler!

54
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,830
Heil Hitler.

55
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,125
It's on, Wallenberg.

56
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,962
At last. When?

57
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,133
A question of days.

58
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,011
A blitzkrieg!
And we're going to win!

59
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,974
The Führer was definite
as to how long it will last.

60
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,477
- Guess.
- A year?

61
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,812
Six months?

62
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,401
Two months at most.

63
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,280
We'll scarcely have time
to enjoy it.

64
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:46,535
We'll enjoy the postwar periods,
Herr Obergruppenführer.

65
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,500
Gentlemen, to the war.

66
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,418
To Germany and the Führer.

67
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,045
Sieg heil.

68
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,737
Wallenberg.

69
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,160
I'll need about 20 girls.

70
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,038
I know that for you
this is an easy task,

71
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,874
but this time, they must not only
be beautiful but intelligent...

72
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,878
and, above all,
good National Socialists.

73
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,382
Go through Germany
with a fine-tooth comb.

74
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,761
Every region, every city,
every village.

75
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,348
Inspect farms,
factories and universities alike.

76
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:54,687
Do not omit any social background,
from the bourgeois to the working class,

77
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,190
from housewives
to office employees.

78
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:03,237
Be they virgins or married,
inspect them thoroughly,

79
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:08,826
but do not forget to base your selection
principally upon their political faith!

80
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,996
And have fun, Wallenberg.

81
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,255
Heil Hitler!

82
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,235
These three cadavers
will give ample proof...

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,404
that our racial theories,

84
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,574
which are a very important part
of our German ideology,

85
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:53,079
are based on
indisputable scientific facts.

86
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:57,416
Uh, the vices
and, uh, corruption...

87
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,919
of, um, the inferior race...

88
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:05,216
are transmitted from
generation to generation
by the chromosomes.

89
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,598
Uh, the pigmentation
of this black man...

90
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,644
bears a direct relationship
to the bestiality of his race...

91
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,065
and the impossibility
of its members
being educated.

92
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,068
He died, uh,
in a drunken stupor...

93
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,070
after a gunfight with the police.

94
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,613
Cover him.

95
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,998
Now, this prostitute,
on the contrary--

96
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,586
this prostitute,
who died sitting up
while attempting an abortion,

97
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,381
is of pure Aryan stock,

98
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:50,636
and in spite of the vices
of her profession
and the corruption of her life...

99
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,723
this cadaver preserves, even now,

100
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,353
uh, all the intrinsic characteristics
of her superior race.

101
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,938
Any questions?

102
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,940
Professor, is it true...

103
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,817
Jesus Christ was the son...

104
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,610
of a Roman prostitute...

105
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,320
and a German mercenary?

106
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,488
Oh, without a doubt.

107
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:15,161
There is not the slightest trace
of Jewish characteristics
in Jesus Christ.

108
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,664
He was blonde, he had blue eyes--

109
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,209
typical signs
of his Germanic origin.

110
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,505
Can you tell me who
was the first man in history...

111
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,009
to recognize this
and make it known to the world?

112
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,096
That's easy, sir.
Our great Führer, Adolf Hitler.

113
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,201
He promised he'd free us...

114
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,746
from communists
and labor unions in six months...

115
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,456
and, by God, he's done it.

116
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,710
Today, German law
is the most advanced of all socially,

117
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,421
far more than the Fascist code in Italy.

118
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,882
It's so Italian!

119
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,843
I admire the Italians, Mother.

120
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,429
And so do I, darling,
for Mediterraneans.

121
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,139
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,975
Mmm.

123
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,936
Yes, for Mediterraneans
they're most handsome.

124
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,190
A little too exotic for my taste.
Too colorful.

125
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,193
Perhaps, but our dear Führer
suffers from a certain lack of chic.

126
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,488
All those brown shirts--
such a dull color!

127
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,448
And his manners, my dear.

128
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,953
The way he holds a teacup
with his little finger raised.

129
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,460
You forget, Mrs. Henckel,
just as my mother and father
sometimes do,

130
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,339
that the National Socialists can't afford
to lose time studying etiquette.

131
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,427
They're too busy
trying to rebuild that order
which you fail to defend...

132
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,221
by drinking tea
without raising your little finger...

133
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,391
and your very chic taste in colors.

134
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,812
Don't you realize?

135
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,023
You're a dead generation.

136
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,191
What?

137
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,656
Good night.

138
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:05,039
Yes, well, um, National Socialism
has a great hold over the young.

139
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:10,878
Well, after all, that's what we were hoping
when we backed Hitler in '33, isn't it?

140
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,298
The most important thing
is to be on the winning side.

141
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,509
That's the side of history,
my dear.

142
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,511
Prosit!
Prosit!

143
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,815
From each of you,
the Führer asks this--

144
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,652
that you wage war
to the best of your ability...

145
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,614
for the triumph
of National Socialism...

146
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,908
and of Germany.

147
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,454
It would have been easy enough
to have chosen professionals,

148
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:55,125
but the Führer has greater confidence
in political faith than in technique.

149
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,130
Where there is goodwill,
technique can be quickly learnt.

150
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,132
It is rather like killing.

151
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:08,430
The first time one can feel remorse,
vomiting, even insomnia.

152
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,183
But then the third time
one sleeps easily...

153
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,603
and from the fifth time on
one goes to dinner
with a healthy appetite.

154
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,191
It becomes exciting, a thrill!

155
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,402
For you too it will be like that.

156
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,950
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler!

157
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,794
Kameraden,
remove your uniforms.

158
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,631
You are about to undergo group testing
with S.S. men of the Third Reich.

159
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,260
It will help you
to get rid of your inhibitions...

160
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,723
and will give naturalness
to your performance.

161
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:37,311
The most qualified will be given
a second examination,

162
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,857
more detailed, more specific.

163
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,535
The test has been tailor-made for you
by our psychosomatic center.

164
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,291
Your duty is to refuse nothing--

165
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,795
coitus, anal coitus,

166
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,341
masturbation and fellatio.

167
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,013
Ready,
Herr Obergruppenführer.

168
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,641
Enjoy yourselves, kameraden.

169
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,976
Use your imagination.

170
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,563
This is also a way to serve the Führer
and the Fatherland.

171
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,108
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!

172
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,910
Ready!

173
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,415
Right face!

174
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,502
March!

175
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:55,263
Left, right, left!
Two, three, four!

176
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,683
Keep your distance!

177
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:02,270
Left, right, left!
Two, three, four!

178
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,855
Left!

179
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,483
Ready!

180
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,235
Halt!

181
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,445
Right face!

182
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,782
Stand straight!

183
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,973
Group 1, men.

184
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,476
Group 2, women.

185
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,814
Group 3, men.

186
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,818
Group 4, women.

187
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,947
Group 5, men.

188
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,784
Group 6, women.

189
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,663
Group 7, men.

190
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,041
Group 8, women.

191
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,253
Group 9, men.

192
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,548
Group 10, women.

193
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,367
Ulrika from Luebeck.

194
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:48,330
Perfect.
Splendid capacity for adaptation.

195
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,501
Olga from Hamburg.

196
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,781
No.

197
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,536
Martha from Danzig.

198
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,860
Rejected.

199
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,033
Margherita from Leipzig.

200
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,741
Approved.

201
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,952
Lela from Düsseldorf.

202
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,669
What is he?
A gypsy.

203
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,850
Weak. Mediocre.
No sense of race.

204
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,894
Are you sure she's Aryan?
Yes.

205
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,021
How embarrassing.

206
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,773
Susan from Berlin.

207
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:48,885
Courageous, determined,

208
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,723
fearless in combat,
steadfast faith
in National Socialism.

209
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,392
Approved.

210
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,146
Is that the lot?
Jawohl,
Herr Obergruppenführer.

211
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,441
I wanted to ask,
what about the rejects?

212
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:08,071
The girls will be sent
to the disciplinary
and educational sections.

213
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,619
The men--

214
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:20,625
Well, my dear Rauss,
we can't have bodies around that can talk.

215
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,963
I thought they still might be
of some use in the labor camps,

216
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,966
or for Dr. Schwab's experiments.

217
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,386
You have one failing, Rauss.

218
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,015
You always want to show that you have
thought things out better than the others.

219
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,185
I repeat, get rid of them!

220
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,396
- Heil!
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

221
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,631
Hey!
Who are you looking for?

222
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:33,091
What frightens you more--
what you see, or what you don't?

223
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,176
Nothing ever frightens me.

224
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,432
The paintings
were removed from sight.

225
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,602
They were degenerate art.

226
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:48,147
Expressionists.
French stuff.

227
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,150
Jewish culture.

228
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,872
No, thank you.
I'd rather have tea.

229
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,042
Tea?

230
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,130
The decadent habits
of the upper class.

231
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,257
No, on the contrary.

232
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,678
The bourgeois drink--
Oh, I don't drink, like the Führer.

233
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,640
Your damned snobbish pride.

234
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,767
You haven't changed.

235
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,854
You're the same
as when you were born.

236
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,025
I believe in National Socialism.

237
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,117
Believing is not enough.

238
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:47,707
To be a real National Socialist,
you have to deny yourself, your origins.

239
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,252
You must accept
total compromise.

240
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,714
You must destroy yourself
to be...

241
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,260
reborn.

242
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,439
You may go.

243
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,821
Good-bye.
It was nice meeting you.

244
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,285
How can I destroy myself?

245
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,630
By humiliation.

246
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,382
How?

247
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,187
Take off your panties!

248
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,985
Quickly!

249
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,622
Pull up your skirt now.

250
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,501
Higher.

251
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,503
Higher!

252
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,758
Higher. Higher!

253
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,886
On your knees.

254
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,140
On your knees!

255
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,065
On all fours and then... crawl.

256
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,195
Faster.

257
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,282
Fast! Fast!

258
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,409
Come here!

259
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,119
Do you see?

260
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,037
You're nothing.

261
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,419
A dog...

262
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,589
trained to obey my commands.

263
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,556
I like the way you fight back.

264
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,351
I like your dignity.

265
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,275
I like your pride.

266
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,321
Share that with me...

267
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,740
and I'll share my power
with you.

268
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,290
Do I repulse you?

269
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,584
Kiss me. Kiss me!

270
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,546
Do something, for God's sake!

271
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,257
I'm not part of your world, am I?

272
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,595
You're in a far more
splendid world.

273
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:47,488
September 1, 1939
Declaration of war on Poland

274
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,822
Free round for the war!
Heil Hitler!

275
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,991
Heil Hitler!

276
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,037
Max! Franz! Rudolf!

277
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,206
Champagne for everybody!
It's from Kitty!

278
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:44,211
I'd love to kiss everyone,
all of Germany!

279
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,801
Let everybody drink!

280
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,898
That is the price
of the mutilated soldiers too, Kitty?

281
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,317
Oh, shut up-- Ohh.

282
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,319
Please.

283
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,322
But they already exist,
the charming victims
of an equally charming war.

284
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,074
Beautiful and mutilated.

285
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,078
More than mutilated--
doomed to suffer agonizing death
within their charging tanks...

286
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,580
instead of on white stallions
along the river banks.

287
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,749
Nice heroic poetry, right?

288
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,752
Dino,
if there weren't any dead,
it wouldn't be a war.

289
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,254
Then Germany couldn't win it
and rule the world,

290
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,883
and we wouldn't be here tonight
drinking champagne and the fun
of this party wouldn't exist!

291
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,718
Right you are!

292
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,138
Cliff is much more amusing
than you, my dear Dino.

293
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:40,726
And more logical too,
as America is farther from Berlin
than my Italia!

294
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:50,444
Gentlemen! Girls!

295
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,655
Friends!

296
00:33:54,157 --> 00:34:00,121
Uh... play something hot, Wolfie,
immediately, or you are out of a job!

297
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,406
Madame.

298
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,700
Madame Kitty.
Madame.

299
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,203
Madame!

300
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,383
Don't be such a wet blanket.

301
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,470
Come and join us.
There's free champagne.

302
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,348
I know the girls don't interest you,
but surely the champagne does.

303
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,769
Sorry, Kitty, I can't.
I've got a thousand things to do.

304
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,562
I'll send you a car.

305
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,733
What shall I put in the car--
girls or champagne?

306
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,651
Just you.

307
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:19,575
I appreciate the compliment, darling,
but I gave up house calls a long time ago.

308
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:24,622
Come if you like, and if you don't,
stay in your office with your pretty ass
glued to your headquarters.

309
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,832
Good-bye!

310
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,721

It's the Gestapo.
Gestapo.

346
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:14,393
Have you gone mad?
To have me brought here
by Gestapo agents to tell me this?

347
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,396
You've got to deport my girls
because they are foreigners?

348
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,398
I have to close down?

349
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,401
Your party needs my house?

350
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,906
I'm not responsible.

351
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,285
Who is responsible?
Himmler? Von Ribbentrop?

352
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,247
They are all my clients,
except for Göring.
Have they gone mad too?

353
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,583
I'll call them all right now!

354
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,585
One after the other.

355
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,587
On a day like this?

356
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,589
Kitty, war has just been declared.

357
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,550
What the hell does war
have to do with my work?

358
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:50,012
Are we going to put on chastity belts
because war has been declared?

359
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,974
Are we all going to join the Red Cross?

360
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,812
Haven't you learnt anything
from the Roman Empire?

361
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,900
You must laugh and sing
if you want to conquer the world.

362
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,320
Do you want my girls
to give singing lessons?

363
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,823
Thank you very much, Kitty,

364
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:14,536
but for the greatness of Germany
our brave soldiers are musical enough.

365
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,333
Don't you think
our brave soldiers...

366
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:26,924
would like to have half an hour in bed
to come before they go?

367
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,801
Hmm?

368
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,261
Naturally.

369
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,681
But remember,
most of them are married.

370
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,643
Wives are for breeding, not for fun.

371
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,939
A soldier has to shoot off his own gun,
not only government issue.

372
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:47,111
Oh, Wallenberg,
sometimes I have the feeling
you don't know what it's all about.

373
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,030
Just because I'm not interested
in your whores?

374
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,032
But that's not the point.

375
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,951
There's nothing
to be done about it.

376
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:58,038
Sorry, Kitty.
You have to close down.

377
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:05,337
You meddling bastard.
You can't ruin me like this.

378
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,465
Give me half a year.
Three months!

379
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,844
Mm-mmm.
Not even one day.

380
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:15,722
I told you-- the party
needs a building right away.

381
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,108
But I can help you.

382
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:32,197
I'll see to it that your girls are replaced
by beautiful German females
of good Aryan stock.

383
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,329
And I know of a spacious villa
in the Grunewald that could be
made available to you.

384
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,002
Thank you, but Kitty has always
been in the center of Berlin.

385
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:49,339
Fresh air makes me dizzy.
I prefer champagne.

386
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,217
Kitty, you're making a mistake.

387
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:57,222
The villa is bigger,
independent, isolated.

388
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,933
The whole neighborhood
would be yours.

389
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,103
It's quiet, discreet...

390
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,233
and, uh... very high class.

391
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,819
I could even get you
a good price on it.

392
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,615
And if I refuse?

393
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,783
I wouldn't if I were you.

394
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:21,622
It wouldn't be very wise,
and you wouldn't only lose your license.

395
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:35,552
You obviously
don't know me well enough,
Herr Untergruppenführer.

396
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,430
If I have to,
I'll go to Hitler himself!

397
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,488
Still. Everybody still.

398
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,156
Smile!

399
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,196
I'll miss this.

400
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,282
I'll miss this view.

401
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:53,964
Charlesey, I don't give a damn
about changing the address.

402
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,218
Love smells the same everywhere,
thank God.

403
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,306
I'm not changing my profession.
I'm not changing you.

404
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:10,439
After all, this isn't a home.

405
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,735
It's just a whorehouse.

406
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,573
Are you crying?

407
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,908
I don't know why!

408
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,707
I swear I don't know why.
I'm so stupid!

409
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,514
For heaven's sake, relax, girls!

410
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,017
You're not in the army,
you know.

411
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,604
Pretty, bring some drinks.
Something strong.

412
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,773
It's freezing cold in this place.

413
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,275
Oh, mm-hmm-hmm,

414
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,362
they certainly stand at attention
in a charming way.

415
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,406
I won't deny that, Wallenberg,
but here it's not enough.

416
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,742
They look like amateurs.
Take her, for example.

417
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,953
She'd be great for a Sunday picnic,
but not for a customer
who wants a decent screw.

418
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:11,208
And her--
Put a baby in her arms...

419
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,543
and give her a pair
of knitting needles and see.

420
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,629
You've got the ideal hausfrau.
No fire!

421
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,967
She looks constipated.
She even makes me feel uncomfortable.

422
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:26,139
Imagine a poor, nervous client.
She'd be more at home
in Sunday School than here.

423
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,893
We need warm, soft girls,
always ready...

424
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,813
and able to laugh and to live it up,
no matter what happens.

425
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,940
Technically,
they are perfect.

426
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,902
I hope they don't salute the clients
when they come in.

427
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,904
You know, with my own girls,
at least,

428
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:46,743
I was sure I knew they could give
a dying man a hard-on.

429
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,580
All right,
loosen them up.

430
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,417
After all, it's your business,
not mine.

431
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:58,380
I'm told you used to be phenomenal.
Teach them to be the same.

432
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,801
Ach!

433
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,688
Ah.

434
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,732
No! No! No!
They are all perfect!

435
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,734
Too damned perfect.
They are boring.

436
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,737
They look like color postcards
to send home to mama.

437
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:30,328
I need specialists, girls able to--
to satisfy any request,

438
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,458
the most complex perversions.

439
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,713
The men who come
to Salon Kitty have fantasies.

440
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,425
If one of the girls doesn't work out,
just let me know.

441
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,178
After all, they're here for your--

442
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,390
Ach! Shit!

443
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,146
That it should come to this.

444
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,774
Us teaching kindergarten.

445
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,116

Hah!

497
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,028
Hey!

498
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:45,495
Bravo.

499
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,501
Perfect.

500
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,963
So, Wallenberg,
this is your battle station.

501
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:58,675
Work carefully, hmm?

502
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,426
And patiently.

503
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,765
To trust is good.
Not to trust is better.

504
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,978
I want to compare the recordings
with the girls' reports personally.
Is that clear?

505
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:16,860
Carry out my orders meticulously,
as you're quite capable of doing.

506
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,445
And have fun, Wallenberg!

507
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,990
Hmm?

508
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,622
And what's your name?
Susan, Herr General.

509
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,792
What's wrong?
Why are you staring like that?

510
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,460
You look at me
as if we'd already met.

511
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,714
All Germany knows you,
Herr General.

512
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,300
You're the conqueror
and subduer of Poland.

513
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,969
Conquer and subdue
my body as well, Herr General!

514
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,773
Let's leave Poland out of this.

515
00:53:55,858 --> 00:54:01,070
The war is too sacred and far too immense
to speak about in a whorehouse.

516
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,740
Put on my boots.

517
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,409
Jawohl, Herr General.

518
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,245
Can you sing?
Jawohl, Herr General.

519
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,165
Then sing to me
and march!

520
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,763
Like my song,
Herr General?

521
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,437
Help me out of my trousers!
Jawohl, Herr General!

522
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,356
Don't call me Herr General!

523
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,858
Call me... Clarita.

524
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,377
Tell me you like.

525
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,045
Oh, yes!

526
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,506
Tell me how it burns!

527
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,424
You're splitting open.

528
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,301
Take it!

529
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,429
Yes, take it! Become a comrade of the Axis.

530
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,139
An official of the Duce.

531
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,725
Tell me you like it.

532
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,186
Tell me how it burns.
You're dying.

533
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,897
You're splitting open.
Say it.

534
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,692
Tell me you're dying. Tell me.

535
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,152
Tell me you're dying.

536
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,071
You're splitting open.
You're hurting yourself.

537
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,741
Give it to me! Give it to me!

538
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,620
You're killing me!
- Say it!

539
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,164
You're dying.
I'm dying. Give it to me!

540
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:40,253
Say it! Say it!

541
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,051
Yes! I like it!

542
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:50,680
More! I'm the woman from Masada.

543
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,598
Yes!

544
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,767
More!

545
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:02,025
Later on!

546
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:07,196
I like it!

547
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:05,963
You'll see whether I'm talking nonsense...

548
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,675
or telling the truth, my little jockey.

549
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:14,722
In Oslo and Copenhagen,

550
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:18,976
we'll be speaking English,
my lovely asshole.

551
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:24,440
A lovely tongue, English--

552
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,069
a tongue worthy of your cunt.

553
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,781
Rauss, type up the report.

554
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,659
Use the exact words.

555
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:38,121
Send the first copy
and the recording to the chancellery...

556
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:42,583
and a second copy
to Reich Führer Himmler--
top secret and urgent.

557
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,418
Without having it
checked first by--

558
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:48,756
Rauss! How many times
do I have to tell you not to be so zealous?

559
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:54,470
I take full responsibility
for this operation...

560
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,098
personally.

561
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:33,593
Well, frankly, I was skeptical.
Raw material coming
from God knows where.

562
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,595
Girls who knew nothing.

563
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,266
For days I sweated blood over them.
I was sure they were going to be a disaster.

564
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,477
But now business is booming,
sold out every night!

565
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:47,440
I can tell from the champagne.
It's impossible to find it
anywhere else but here.

566
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,194
And there is plenty more
where that came from.
Von Ribbentrop is a friend of mine.

567
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:55,239
Ribbentrop also gives you--
Huh?

568
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,905
Have you been at the front?

569
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,204
Uh-huh.

570
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:47,792
You made love
as if you hated me.

571
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,211
No, it's not true.

572
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,757
Do you still want it?

573
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,384
Always.

574
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,219
So do I.

575
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:04,433
Why? Oh, yeah, sure. Sure.
It's your job.

576
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,562
Too bad.

577
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,898
Too bad you don't know
what it means.

578
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,984
Why are you in Berlin?

579
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,696
On leave?

580
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,490
Don't you want to talk?

581
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,575
I want to fuck.

582
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,579
But if you don't want to--

583
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,456
I want to.

584
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,504
That's not true.

585
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,589
Why do you say that?

586
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,557
It's not true.

587
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,896
But why should I care?
Why should I give a damn?

588
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,442
Just spread your legs.

589
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,197
I feel like it too.

590
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,879
Not like that.

591
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,216
Without anger.

592
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,888
With tenderness.

593
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,145
Relax.

594
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:43,324
Margherita.

595
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,707
Margherita, report number 48.

596
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:39,380
- Hans Reiter.
- Hauptmann.

597
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,590
On leave from the front.

598
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,592
Unwilling to talk.

599
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,303
He only wanted to make love,

600
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:50,224
an act which he completed
several times.

601
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,611
You are lovely.

602
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:46,280
Making love with you
is just beautiful,

603
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,449
even if you are a whore.

604
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,956
Life has taught me to hate,

605
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,126
but with you
I remember when I didn't.

606
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,130
Are you in Berlin to get a medal?

607
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:05,216
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

608
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,177
I, uh, wear it on my back.

609
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,562
Will you fight again?

610
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,567
I don't think
I'm a good soldier.

611
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:26,487
When do you leave?

612
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,199
Soon. In 10 days.

613
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,161
An eternity for making love.

614
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,749
Yeah, an eternity
which ends right away.

615
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,216
I wish I could
take you with me...

616
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,302
to make love to you
whenever I want.

617
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,308
It's so good with you.

618
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,146
You're exaggerating.

619
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,734
Do you mind?

620
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,444
No.

621
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,947
But you mustn't exaggerate.
It's not right.

622
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,452
Would you mind
if I fell in love with you? Hmm?

623
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:18,706
Just a little.

624
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,791
Would it seem ridiculous?

625
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,464
Love is a word you can always say
when two people are in bed together.

626
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,883
Mmm.

627
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,635
Yeah.

628
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:05,294
- Air raid!
- It's an air raid! An air raid!

629
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,673
- Come on!
- Get to the shelter!

630
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,633
Hurry! Hurry!
Look alive!

631
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,846
Turn the lights down!

632
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,309
Hilde! Come down here!

633
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,358
Hilde!

634
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:42,247
Mmm!

635
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,817
Good luck.

636
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,827
Good luck to me
to have found you.

637
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,917
A gift before going back to war.

638
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,344
Oh!

639
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,683
Uh, I saw light coming
from under the door.
Aren't you afraid?

640
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,185
British planes
will never fly over Berlin.

641
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,563
Göring himself
has promised us that.

642
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:52,234
- That's no reason to get drunk. Even you.
- Well, have a drink with us.

643
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,820
Thank you.
Today is
an important anniversary.

644
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:58,615
What of?
Well, it's exactly a week
that Margherita and I have met.

645
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,702
Mmm. Many happy returns.
To you too, Margherita.

646
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,177
I don't like anniversaries.

647
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,513
I only like drinking
champagne with him.

648
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,475
Not even with him.

649
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,727
I just like the champagne.

650
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,273
Too many good wishes
bring bad luck.

651
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:51,353
Why, Hans?

652
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,397
Tell me why.

653
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,066
Hans.

654
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,859
Why?

655
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:07,578
Train departing for Grunewald
from Platform 1.

656
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,456
Train departing for Grunewald
from Platform 1.

657
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,376
Come on! Hurry up!

658
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:27,431
Next train for Grunewald departs
in 20 minutes from Platform 1.

659
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,944
Left, left, left, two, three, four.

660
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,488
Man, you are not doing it right.

661
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:56,585
BLACK OUT

662
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,993
Why, Hans? Why?

663
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:48,220
The entire country's floundering
knee-deep in human blood,

664
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,681
and it's far from being over.

665
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,600
From Warsaw to Leopolis,
as far as you can see--

666
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:58,730
gutted houses, burnt fields,
dead horses rotting in the sun,
carrion for the vultures,

667
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:03,527
heaps of men, women and children--
terrifying silent minds.

668
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,530
Defenseless people, gunned down
by nose-diving Messerschmitts.

669
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,532
I, too, have killed them.

670
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,493
I thought I was born
to build places to live and love in.

671
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:20,085
Instead, I've become the architect
of a horrible cemetery without graves,

672
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,380
without coffins.

673
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,967
No!

674
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,802
No! No!

675
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,637
Margherita.

676
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:32,723
Margherita!

677
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,899
MEN

678
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,417
Love me, Hans.
Love me again.

679
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,920
Do you realize now
what your sadness means?

680
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,300
It's our last day.
Stop talking.

681
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,809
I'm getting out of this slaughterhouse,
together with you.

682
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,770
But you're a soldier.
It's your duty to fight.

683
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,730
I know.

684
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:06,399
And until yesterday,
I accepted it all.

685
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,652
But now I've made up my mind.

686
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:14,157
I'm going to fight against Hitler,

687
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:17,118
against his madness,

688
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,330
against the violence
which is corrupting us all.

689
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,916
Hauptmann Hans Reiter
came again today.

690
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,501
What can you do?

691
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,797
When I get back to my base,

692
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,550
I'll simply defect to the other side
with my aircraft.

693
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:32,717
That's treason!

694
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,346
He rarely spoke--

695
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,057
only fragments of thoughts.

696
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,142
He's introverted,

697
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:45,981
but he seems honest,
sincere and secure...

698
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,067
in his National Socialist faith.

699
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:54,865
Margherita,
man belongs to humanity,

700
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:59,077
not to a nation or a race
or to a religion.

701
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,710
My conscience is clear.

702
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:09,337
He constantly made love to me,

703
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,884
which is only right
for a soldier preparing
to return to the front.

704
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:17,804
Margherita, man belongs to humanity,

705
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:22,142
not to a nation or a race
or to a religion.

706
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,144
My conscience is clear.

707
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:28,148
In the report, the girl
has surely given the officer's name.

708
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:31,192
Jawohl,
Herr Untergruppenführer.

709
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,528
Hauptmann Hans Reiter.

710
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:43,663
Precise and faithful.

711
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,957
He is going back
to his base today.

712
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,587
Take care of him.

713
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,589
Right away.

714
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:59,429
Jawohl, Herr Untergruppenführer.

715
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:02,933
Hauptmann Hans Reiter.
You fell in love with him.

716
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,517
No.

717
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,020
Drink it.

718
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,774
I'm sure you've also learned
to love champagne.

719
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:13,068
You saw him every day
for two weeks.

720
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:15,028
He asked for me at the salon.

721
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:18,698
And...

722
01:16:18,783 --> 01:16:21,284
you just spread your legs.

723
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:26,122
I told you to come in
only if I called you.

724
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,542
- Get out.
- Good-bye, miss.

725
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,127
I am Helga Wallenberg.

726
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,882
I married her
a long time ago.

727
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,718
She's an excellent wife.

728
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:40,804
Discreet and faithful.

729
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,100
Get out.

730
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,024
No. Wait.

731
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:59,864
Pretend she is Hans Reiter.

732
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,034
Show me what he liked.

733
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,622
You didn't write that down
in your reports.

734
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:11,334
What is it? Is your pride
still getting in your way?

735
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,473
Stop that!

736
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,979
Get out!

737
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:41,401
I didn't think you'd get involved
with this sentimental nonsense.

738
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,153
I overestimated you.

739
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,363
Why? Who am I
in your opinion?

740
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,616
What you are your Hans
will never understand.

741
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,744
Anyway, he has nothing
to offer you.
Do you?

742
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,373
Look at this!

743
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,502
It's all mine now.

744
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:04,132
And look here. Look.

745
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,636
Look at this.

746
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,224
And this-- it's mine too.

747
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,690
Things others dream of,
I already possess!

748
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:31,784
I want you, too, in my private dream.

749
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,829
You need another ghost,
like your wife?

750
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:39,375
It's my wish, but your duty.

751
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,298
You want me to lose my body,
my very being?

752
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,592
Would you rather stay
as you are now'

753
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,845
with your pitiful love affair?

754
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:55,600
My aims are higher.
That's why I'm a National Socialist.

755
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,645
power.

756
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,189
And with you,
it would be complete.

757
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,900
Compared with all this,

758
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,653
what does your pilot's
ridiculous love mean?

759
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,071
It's not love.

760
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:18,706
Here. I have a letter from him.

761
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,554
I could destroy him.

762
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,151
Heinsberg, the 25th.

763
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,446
My darling, I have just arrived.

764
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,241
Not even an hour has passed
since I got here,

765
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,995
and already I feel
a deep, deep need for you.

766
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:05,169
I got the letter through
without its being censored.

767
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,171
Not one but you
has read it.

768
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,425
You see, I can do
anything I want.

769
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,051
I know.

770
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,975
You manipulate emotions...

771
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,898
as I manipulate things
through willpower.

772
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,862
That's how I want you--
with my will.

773
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,118
Now you belong to me.

774
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:40,079
You're mine.

775
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,583
I want you to say
you're my accomplice.

776
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,918
Say it.

777
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:48,087
Say it. Accomplice.

778
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,548
Say it.

779
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,093
Say it.

780
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,604
...a deep-- a deep need for you.

781
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,940
...deep need for you.

782
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,318
...need for you.

783
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,778
...for you.

784
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:16,324
Oh, please, ladies, give it back.

785
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,396
You're all being so mean.

786
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:50,608
Oh! The lonely butterfly.

787
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,610
I don't find this
clowning funny.

788
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,780
Oh, you must be sort of special.
The neurotics like it.

789
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:59,617
If you're clever,
you can get rich in no time.
Money. That's all you think about.

790
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,413
Of course, dear.
That's all any good professional
should think about.

791
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:05,498
And when you've made your bundle,
you quit.

792
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,835
Money's the only thing
that gives freedom a respectability.

793
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:11,587
You think like a servant.

794
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:14,006
You have no ideals.

795
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,509
You're not
a National Socialist.

796
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,348
Ah, my dear child.

797
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:26,185
First and foremost,
I am a madam above ideals.

798
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:30,064
Just as, despite Hitler, your husband,
your child and your party,

799
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:33,109
you are a whore-- a whore.

800
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,820
I am not! I am not!

801
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:39,866
I am not! I am not a whore!
I'm not a whore!

802
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,702
Stop it!
Ladies!

803
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:45,580
No, no, don't!

804
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,832
Kitty, are you all right?

805
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:54,630
Oh, my God!

806
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,341
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

807
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,512
Being a whore is an easy life--

808
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:04,056
a luxurious life, so they say.

809
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:08,019
They let themselves
get fooled into it,
and then it's too late.

810
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:11,147
Liebe, Hilde, liebe Hilde.

811
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,571
Why don't you undress?

812
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,084
Do you like my stockings?

813
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,674
Go over there and lie down.

814
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,178
I want you over there.

815
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,149
Put out the light.

816
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,321
Open this.

817
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,407
What is it?
It's pastry.

818
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,493
You like pastry?
Mm-hmm.

819
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:53,499
It's for the two of us.
It comes from the finest
bakery in Berlin.

820
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:57,295
Huge, isn't it?
Put it between your legs.

821
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,048
Go on.
Spread your legs wider.

822
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,843
But make sure you keep it
straight up.

823
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:07,221
I want you to make me believe
it's your cock.

824
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:11,601
Big. Such a beautiful
big dick.

825
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,338
What's wrong with you?

826
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,798
Heil Hitler!

827
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,511
Lie down!
Lie down, I said!

828
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,805
Heil Hitler!

829
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,808
Help! Help me!

830
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,874
The poor girl.
It was a mistake.

831
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,876
I shouldn't have told you.

832
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:04,880
I should not have let you
destroy her this way!

833
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,883
Calm yourself.

834
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:11,178
I trust there will be
no further incidents of this sort.

835
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,764
If there are,
call me immediately.

836
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,766
I'll take care of everything.

837
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,309
As you did today?

838
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:20,229
As I did today.

839
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,031
What are you staring at?

840
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:33,367
Go away while you still can!

841
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:35,870
This is a lousy life!

842
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:40,332
A life full of shit, vomit,
jizz, pricks, cunts and idiots!

843
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:44,837
Go away! All of you!

844
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:55,890
You. Especially you.

845
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:02,188
What need have you
to be humiliated by men?

846
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:06,901
You're so beautiful, so gentle.

847
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:10,446
Save yourself.

848
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,990
Anything is better than this.

849
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:17,953
Save yourself.
Save yourself, Margherita.

850
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:36,055
How did you manage
to hide it until now?

851
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:40,684
By wearing a corset.
The men, well, they never
notice things like that.

852
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,772
But now my child shows.

853
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:49,026
You should have
informed us immediately.

854
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:52,571
Why didn't you?
I want to have the baby.

855
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,365
I've never heard
of anything so ridiculous.

856
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,950
It's mine.

857
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,287
- And the father?
- It's mine.

858
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:03,415
Do you mean to say
you'd consider having a baby...

859
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,210
without proper state control?

860
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:11,048
Have you forgotten
that you are still an S.S. woman?
One of our auxiliaries?

861
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,342
It's mine.

862
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,981
Psychologically,
this girl is finished,

863
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:29,441
so far as her mission
is concerned.

864
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,489
We can't have a whore like her
walking around.

865
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,199
She knows too much.

866
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:41,495
Doctor, the solution
is up to you now.

867
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,373
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

868
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:29,084
Your must be Margherita,
Hans Reiter's girl.

869
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,128
We were in the same squadron.

870
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:34,173
He told me about you.

871
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,342
Yes, I know him.

872
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,344
He's been here.

873
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:40,346
Do you know
he was in love with you?

874
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,974
It happens.
Fortunately,
he got over it quickly.

875
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,060
I don't think he did.

876
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:01,992
That's too bad. A man should never
fall in love with a girl like me.

877
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:05,037
Why?

878
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,289
I'm a whore.
Hmm.

879
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,895
Where is he now?

880
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,481
Don't you know?

881
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:36,068
He was hanged
a few days after he got back.

882
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,572
For defeatism
and anti-patriotism.

883
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:44,827
Ah. There was
an S.S. report from Berlin.

884
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:47,371
He was planning to desert.

885
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,582
He was going to defect
to the enemy, the swine.

886
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,043
We thought he was
a good comrade, the shit.

887
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:56,005
In public he defended
National Socialism,

888
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,966
and in private
he called us murderers.

889
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,552
He was a goddamn coward.

890
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,263
No balls.

891
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:07,016
Fortunately, he gave himself away.

892
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:11,979
They hanged the son of a bitch
on a meat hook.

893
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:15,983
I got a kick out of seeing
that bastard hanging up there.

894
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:18,068
Like a stuck pig.

895
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:26,368
I even had the satisfaction
of spitting on his corp--

896
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:37,880
Margherita! Margherita!

897
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,309
Ohh!

898
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,504
Get me Wallenberg's office, please.

899
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,761
Wallenberg? It's Kitty.
We've had some trouble here.

900
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:29,098
An officer shot himself
in the shower.

901
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:51,411
When are you
going back to Berlin?

902
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,247
I don't know, Mother.

903
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:56,208
Darling, are you
on sick leave or what?

904
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,878
Yes, I am.

905
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:03,132
A sort
of nervous breakdown.

906
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,551
From overwork,
let us say.

907
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:08,971
And what about them?
Do they approve?

908
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,974
They? They who?

909
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,143
What do you know about it?

910
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:16,395
You don't know
what I do.

911
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,439
You just noticed
that one day I left home.

912
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:22,276
You never gave a thought
as to what my work might be.

913
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,902
Well, you never gave me permission--

914
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:27,239
Neither did I give you permission
to make me join the National Socialist Party.

915
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,324
To bear a grudge
is childish.

916
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,285
I don't bear any grudge.

917
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,744
You despise us!

918
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:34,997
I do.

919
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,332
I despise your hypocrisy,

920
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:40,043
your refusal to face the truth.

921
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,880
You hide in silence
behind your law and order.

922
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,882
And our tradition!

923
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:47,676
A fine tradition.
Look at yourselves.

924
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,012
Two mummified insects.

925
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,014
Why should people
like you be saved?

926
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:55,100
Today's youth isn't concerned
about the past or the future,

927
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,769
so it is up to the elders
to preserve our--
Preserve what?

928
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,938
Your hide?

929
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,607
Your property?

930
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:06,069
With your eyes closed
so as not to see, not to think?

931
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:10,866
- A few months ago,
you sang a very different song.
- Mm-hmm.

932
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:16,705
- It's for you, miss.
- Who is it?

933
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,874
Madam Kitty Kellermann!

934
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,710
Kitty?

935
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,712
Tell her I'm not at home.

936
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,756
Say you don't where I am.

937
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,176
No, wait.
Show her to the winter garden.

938
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:35,891
Margherita, what kind of work
do you do in Berlin?

939
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,684
Invent something, Father.

940
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:41,188
Whatever makes your conscience
sleep in peace.

941
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:47,569
I understand you, darling.

942
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:50,030
At your age,
I would have done the same thing.

943
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:54,368
But I can't keep
on covering for you.
Wallenberg wants you back.

944
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,872
So now you're pimping for Wallenberg.

945
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:06,129
I don't pimp for anybody,
especially not for a politician
like Wallenberg.

946
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:10,300
But don't forget
that a German officer
was killed in your room.

947
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:13,303
It's not only stupid
but dangerous
to fight a man like him.

948
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,347
Are you blackmailing me?

949
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,891
Well, I don't give a damn.
Go ahead and tell him.

950
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:22,271
Tell him I blew his brains out.
Tell him I killed that pig to avenge Hans.

951
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:26,108
Did you really love him
that much?

952
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:36,076
You don't have
to come back tomorrow
or the next day. Take your time.

953
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,705
Meanwhile,
I'll try to smooth things over.

954
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:42,666
There's nothing to smooth over.
I'm not going back.

955
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,585
Don't bother to lie.
Write the report yourself.

956
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,463
Margherita is leaving
Operation Kitty!

957
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:51,341
What operation?
The one that gets people
hanged on meat hooks.

958
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:55,220
What the hell
are you talking about?
The operation you run, Kitty.

959
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:58,015
The nest of spies
who drink champagne and fuck...

960
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:00,851
and report every secret they learn
back to Wallenberg.

961
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,729
It's not true.
There's not a word of truth
in what you say.

962
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:07,399
Stop it, Kitty.
Stop playacting with me.
I don't ask you to justify yourself.

963
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:10,402
I don't give a fuck
if you're in partnership with Wallenberg.

964
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:14,865
Me? Partnership
with that S.S. captain?

965
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,867
You've all been spying.

966
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,202
Spies! Spies! Spies!

967
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:24,166
In my house! In my honest,
clean, beautiful house!

968
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:27,336
I hate you!
The whole lot of you!

969
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,881
I never dirtied myself
with all that political shit.

970
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:43,226
People can do
whatever they want in there.

971
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:45,604
Sex is clean.

972
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,406
Now I understand everything.

973
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,368
He changed the house.
He changed the girls.

974
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,578
He thought he could
change Kitty too.

975
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,582
But I'll show that bastard Wallenberg.
I'll get him. I'll destroy him.

976
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:09,795
I'll go to Himmler.
I'll go to Hitler.

977
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:12,547
And this time, I mean it.

978
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,595
Forgive me, Kitty.

979
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,180
Don't cry.

980
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:23,308
I suspected you.

981
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:25,435
I thought you were in on it with him.

982
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,271
Me? Oh, you idiot.

983
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:31,441
You must be out of your mind.

984
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:33,652
Forgive me.

985
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,153
But then,

986
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:40,075
how could Wallenberg know
every single word Hans said,
as if he'd been there?

987
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,331
We were alone,
absolutely alone.

988
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:49,334
How did they know
what Hans felt?

989
01:40:49,419 --> 01:40:51,461
His decision to defect?

990
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:54,881
That's why they killed him.
How did they know?

991
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:58,427
You put that butcher's hook
into him.

992
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:00,846
No. Hans? No.

993
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:03,974
I never wrote a word
of what Hans told me-- not a word.

994
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:09,062
I didn't want to admit
that I loved him.

995
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,982
But now I know.

996
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:14,234
I also know what he meant
when he said,

997
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:18,113
"I'm going to get out of this slaughterhouse,
together with you."

998
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:23,618
He knew that I, too,
would begin to think, to understand.

999
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:29,541
Kitty.

1000
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:31,710
Don't you want to be
on my side?

1001
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:34,254
No. On that side, never.

1002
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:36,381
I need your help.

1003
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:38,717
I feel I'm waking
from a nightmare.

1004
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,802
When are you going
to wake up too?

1005
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:47,893
I don't understand
anything anymore.
Not a thing.

1006
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:50,979
Well, neither do I, Kitty.
But don't you see?

1007
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:54,191
Now we must help each other.
Let's try.

1008
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:58,570
What do you want to do?

1009
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,864
Let's go back to Berlin...

1010
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:05,410
and find out how Wallenberg
knows everything we do
and everything we say,

1011
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:08,580
all the time, in every room.

1012
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:12,626
I want to clean up my house, Margherita,

1013
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:14,377
whatever the cost.

1014
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:17,589
I want it clean like it was before. Clean.

1015
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:16,458
I go. I piss. I come back.

1016
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,466
Kitty.

1017
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:35,226
"Brutus is a man of great honor."

1018
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,646
No. "Brutus is an honorable man."

1019
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:45,320
Ciao, Kitty.
Have you come to feast your eyes?

1020
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:53,119
I have known many men in my life,
but you-- How can I resist you?

1021
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:55,830
It takes a strong woman.

1022
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:59,417
Huh. What's going on?

1023
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:02,754
Are we making the famous Salon Kitty
into some den of iniquity...

1024
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:05,465
like the decadent past
of ancient Roma, huh?

1025
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:07,550
Get yourself a sheet, Kitty.

1026
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,098
We have to talk to you,
if you can stop clowning
for a moment.

1027
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:15,266
I obey. What's up?

1028
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:21,106
I found out why Wallenberg
forced me to move here.

1029
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,274
We are being spied on.

1030
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:25,360
The girls are all S.S. agents.

1031
01:45:26,612 --> 01:45:30,782
Every day they report
all the nonsense you men
are foolish enough to say in bed.

1032
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:34,619
Le ragazze sono delle S.S.?
Mm-hmm.

1033
01:45:34,704 --> 01:45:36,287
Oh, shit.

1034
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:39,666
You mean they're not only whores,
but bitches too? Sorry, Margherita.

1035
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:44,212
That's not all.
The rooms are bugged.

1036
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:47,549
No. The bathrooms aren't.

1037
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:50,093
Ah, indeed.

1038
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:53,513
They couldn't hear anyway
because of the water.
Ah, but if they could.

1039
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:59,352
Don't believe that those Nazi bastards
are democratic or kind enough
to let us piss in peace.

1040
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:01,438
Which reminds me.

1041
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,653
We need your help.

1042
01:46:08,738 --> 01:46:10,655
What for?

1043
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,699
To destroy him.

1044
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:20,331
Well, it's a bit unusual
to conspire in a bathroom,
even for an Italian.

1045
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:23,918
But when a problem is that shitty,
you discuss it in a shithouse.

1046
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:25,670
Hoorah!

1047
01:46:25,755 --> 01:46:28,339
Hoorah!

1048
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:33,636
Paris is ours!

1049
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:42,437
I drink to the German soldiers...

1050
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:47,233
who are marching
under the Arc de Triomphe!

1051
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:48,943
Heil Hitler!

1052
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:51,279
Heil Hitler!

1053
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:56,618
Once again, everybody!

1054
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:58,995
Sieg heil!

1055
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:01,331
Heil Hitler!

1056
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:18,431
Vive La France!

1057
01:47:18,516 --> 01:47:20,475
Vive La France!

1058
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:22,936
Vive La France!

1059
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,190
Vive La France!

1060
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:33,029
Heil Hitler!

1061
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:36,866
Vive La France!
Vive La France!

1062
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:39,911
Madame, mademoiselle, monsieur!

1063
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:43,998
Le Can-can!

1064
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:45,078
At last. What happened?
Where are you?

1065
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:48,748
In Paris.
The French are delighted
to have been liberated by the Weimar.

1066
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:52,919
As you know, my Italia
has now joined forces with Germany--

1067
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:56,798
just in time for history
to put us in the books of major triumphs.

1068
01:49:56,882 --> 01:50:01,803
The big brass decided
I'm the best war correspondent.
I couldn't refuse the honor.

1069
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:04,472
And what-- what about me?
You have forgotten me?

1070
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:08,893
Ah, no. You know your kisses
are unforgettable, cara.

1071
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:11,354
Pretend that I'm still there
with you as always.

1072
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:15,483
I do, but it doesn't help.
I miss you terribly.
Thank you for calling, darling.

1073
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:18,361
No, darling, just a minute.
I had to call you anyway.

1074
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:22,031
Remember in Margherita's bathroom?
I forgot to turn off the shower.

1075
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,075
The bathroom will be flooded.

1076
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:26,160
You'd better go up, huh? Capito?

1077
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:28,162
Turn it off. Capito?

1078
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:31,165
Margherita's bathroom.
But hurry. Presto. Capito?

1079
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:34,293
You know you can't call
the plumber after 10:00.

1080
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:38,464
Understand, huh?
I miss you.

1081
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:57,316
Excuse me.

1082
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:00,028
Aren't you feeling well?

1083
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:03,698
I feel fine, thanks.

1084
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:07,493
Don't worry. I know everything.
Dino asked me to bring you a present.

1085
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:16,794
It's a new kind
of radio transmitter.

1086
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:20,256
A great little gadget.

1087
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:22,759
It'll relay everything
up to half a mile.

1088
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:25,553
Oh?
It's quite simple.

1089
01:51:25,637 --> 01:51:29,057
You just turn it on, and I'll record
whatever you want me to.

1090
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:39,609
I see you so rarely.

1091
01:52:28,951 --> 01:52:31,327
Why don't you say something?

1092
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,412
Are you angry with me?

1093
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:35,516
Speak to me. Say something.

1094
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:17,433
You like that, don't you?

1095
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:20,436
Slave and master.

1096
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:25,316
Oh, God, but I've wanted you.

1097
01:55:42,311 --> 01:55:44,312
Drink it.

1098
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:56,490
I despise whores.
They are paid to let us.

1099
01:55:57,826 --> 01:56:02,830
What am I then?
Even if I don't do it for money,
I'm still a whore.

1100
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:06,792
You're my creation.

1101
01:56:08,128 --> 01:56:09,628
I invented you.

1102
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:12,840
You're my accomplice.

1103
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:16,594
Do everything you want, anything.

1104
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:19,930
God knows when I'll see you again.

1105
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:22,016
Very soon.

1106
01:56:27,522 --> 01:56:29,732
Wait.

1107
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:32,693
I want to make it last
as long as possible.

1108
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:37,281
Your wife?
I've sent her away.

1109
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:39,742
Even the servant
has the day off.

1110
01:56:41,036 --> 01:56:43,287
She's still your wife.

1111
01:56:43,372 --> 01:56:46,582
Soon I'll be powerful enough
to get rid of her.

1112
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:52,546
Kiss me. Please kiss me.

1113
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:56,717
This house is no place for illusions.

1114
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:02,306
They're not illusions.

1115
01:57:12,984 --> 01:57:14,068
Look!

1116
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:18,114
My wife's grandfather was a Jew.

1117
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:29,041
If they find out,
that could be dangerous,
even for you.

1118
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:33,379
Not when I have the power I deserve--
the power of Himmler.

1119
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:38,968
You're mad.

1120
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:45,349
I have in my hands the bedroom secrets
of everybody in Germany--

1121
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:48,769
Ribbentrop, Goebbels,

1122
01:57:48,854 --> 01:57:50,938
Keitel, Jodl,

1123
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:55,609
even Himmler himself.

1124
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:57,695
I know the weak points of...

1125
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:01,907
every single one of them.

1126
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,161
The cocaine they take,

1127
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:09,039
their impotence, their perversions,

1128
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:12,001
their thieving, their betrayals,

1129
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:14,003
their rivalries.

1130
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:16,338
Defeatist cowards.

1131
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,966
What do your superiors
think about it?

1132
01:58:20,552 --> 01:58:23,762
They won't have time to think.

1133
01:58:23,847 --> 01:58:29,685
The original idea wasn't mine, I admit,

1134
01:58:29,769 --> 01:58:33,105
but I know how I can get rid of them all,

1135
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:35,316
at my convenience.

1136
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:39,987
You have illusions
about your power.

1137
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:42,156
No, no, no.

1138
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,158
Every word is true.

1139
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:46,827
It's true!

1140
01:58:46,912 --> 01:58:49,371
Get that through your head!

1141
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:52,416
I don't give a damn
about National Socialism,

1142
01:58:52,501 --> 01:58:56,045
just as none of our leaders
give a damn!

1143
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:58,881
It's a means to an end-- power!

1144
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:01,717
There are no ideals, no faith.

1145
01:59:04,513 --> 01:59:08,265
You are the one
with illusions, Margherita--

1146
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:13,270
you and the millions of other Germans
who believed in us.

1147
01:59:14,523 --> 01:59:18,484
It's a way to get you all
under our thumb.

1148
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:24,532
You, a bourgeois,

1149
01:59:26,034 --> 01:59:28,702
under the thumb of a pimp.

1150
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:34,124
To have you and what you stood for,

1151
01:59:38,421 --> 01:59:40,422
I got you down to my level.

1152
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,927
Just like all the others.

1153
01:59:45,929 --> 01:59:49,932
Reduced to
a world of gangsters.

1154
01:59:53,228 --> 01:59:56,814
We made criminals
out of all of you.

1155
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:58,857
Murderers, thieves,

1156
01:59:58,942 --> 02:00:01,193
corrupted accomplices...

1157
02:00:01,278 --> 02:00:04,530
and slaves.

1158
02:00:04,614 --> 02:00:06,365
I believe you.

1159
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:09,910
But let's not talk about that now.

1160
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:12,913
Touch me here.

1161
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:18,085
Make me come.

1162
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,588
Let me feel your power.

1163
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:25,092
Whore.

1164
02:00:28,847 --> 02:00:34,351
I made you, a whore, into one
of the first ladies of the Third Reich.

1165
02:00:34,436 --> 02:00:36,353
Pimp.

1166
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:38,355
Whore.

1167
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:43,736
A whore and a pimp
who salute each other in public.

1168
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:48,324
Heil... Hitler.

1169
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,960
No one knows anything about us.

1170
02:01:02,047 --> 02:01:03,964
Only I.

1171
02:01:07,969 --> 02:01:09,470
Heil--

1172
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:55,516
What's the matter, honey?

1173
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,768
Are you getting tired
of all this?

1174
02:01:57,852 --> 02:02:01,647
I'd like to see you at it--
my legs spread all day long.

1175
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:03,607
It's no fun anymore.

1176
02:02:03,733 --> 02:02:06,985
Why don't you quit?
If only I could.

1177
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:11,281
You're sweet, you know.
I like you.

1178
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:13,951
Take me to America with you.
Would you?

1179
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:16,662
Sure. If you put
some clothes on.

1180
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:19,540
I'll get my things together,
and we'll go.

1181
02:02:19,624 --> 02:02:21,125
Listen.

1182
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:31,343
I'll be back in a minute.
Get ready.

1183
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:35,347
Roosevelt's waiting for you.

1184
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:38,726
Shh.

1185
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:53,198
Cliff!

1186
02:02:53,283 --> 02:02:54,992
In a minute!

1187
02:03:42,749 --> 02:03:44,958
She hanged herself.

1188
02:03:45,043 --> 02:03:46,585
Son of a bitch.

1189
02:04:08,817 --> 02:04:10,275
Jesus God.

1190
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:13,153
Untergruppenführer Wallenberg
is not here!

1191
02:04:16,491 --> 02:04:18,534
I haven't come to see him.

1192
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:21,954
I've come to charge him with treason.

1193
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:24,873
Wallenberg?

1194
02:04:25,875 --> 02:04:27,876
Do you realize
what you are doing?

1195
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:31,755
I do. I am a National Socialist.

1196
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:36,134
I know that traitors must be crushed
without pity, no matter who they are.

1197
02:04:37,303 --> 02:04:39,304
Do you have any proof?

1198
02:04:41,683 --> 02:04:43,600
This is my report.

1199
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:46,687
You will recognize Wallenberg's
voice on this recording.

1200
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,240
How did you find out?

1201
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,367
I'm his mistress.

1202
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:07,082
We shall look into it.
We shall listen.

1203
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:10,085
Listen to it
and take action immediately.

1204
02:05:10,169 --> 02:05:12,921
Mine is a professional accusation.

1205
02:05:15,383 --> 02:05:19,136
If you don't feel you can handle
the matter, just say so.

1206
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,471
I'll go directly
to Reich führer Himmler.

1207
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:24,224
I'll take care of it immediately!
Don't worry, kamarad!

1208
02:05:30,773 --> 02:05:32,274
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!

1209
02:05:40,241 --> 02:05:41,742
Come in.

1210
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:46,371
A report and a recording!
Very urgent!

1211
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:48,916
Top secret,
Herr Obergruppenführer!

1212
02:06:06,434 --> 02:06:08,685
Look!

1213
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,271
My wife's grandfather was a Jew.

1214
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:18,528
If they find out,
that could be dangerous, even for you.

1215
02:06:18,655 --> 02:06:22,491
Not when I have the power I deserve--
the power of Himmler.

1216
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:27,537
You're mad.

1217
02:06:28,665 --> 02:06:34,044
I have in my hands the bedroom secrets
of everybody in Germany--

1218
02:06:34,128 --> 02:06:37,214
Ribbentrop, Goebbels,

1219
02:06:37,298 --> 02:06:38,966
Keitel, Jodl,

1220
02:06:40,301 --> 02:06:43,053
even Himmler himself.

1221
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:46,306
I know the weak points of...

1222
02:06:47,642 --> 02:06:49,685
every single one of them.

1223
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:54,523
The cocaine they take,

1224
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:57,734
their impotence, their perversions,

1225
02:06:57,819 --> 02:07:00,070
their thieving, their betrayals,

1226
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:02,364
their rivalries.

1227
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:04,366
Defeatist cowards.

1228
02:07:05,618 --> 02:07:08,662
What do your superiors
think about it?

1229
02:07:09,914 --> 02:07:13,250
They won't have time to think.

1230
02:07:13,334 --> 02:07:14,751
Heil Hitler!

1231
02:07:14,836 --> 02:07:19,006
The original idea wasn't mine, I admit,

1232
02:07:19,090 --> 02:07:22,801
but I know
how I can get rid of them all,

1233
02:07:22,885 --> 02:07:24,594
at my convenience.

1234
02:07:24,679 --> 02:07:26,930
You have illusions
about your power.

1235
02:07:27,015 --> 02:07:28,932
No, no, no.

1236
02:07:29,017 --> 02:07:31,309
Every word is true.

1237
02:07:31,394 --> 02:07:33,520
It's true!

1238
02:07:33,604 --> 02:07:36,231
Get that through your head!

1239
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:39,276
I don't give a damn
about National Socialism,

1240
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:43,030
just as none of our leaders
give a damn!

1241
02:07:43,114 --> 02:07:45,615
It's a means to an end-- power!

1242
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:48,535
There are no ideals, no faith.

1243
02:07:51,164 --> 02:07:54,791
You are the one
with illusions, Margherita--

1244
02:07:54,876 --> 02:07:59,880
you and the millions of other Germans
who believed in us.

1245
02:08:01,883 --> 02:08:05,052
It's a way to get you all
under our thumb.

1246
02:08:06,554 --> 02:08:09,431
You, a bourgeois,

1247
02:08:10,475 --> 02:08:13,477
under the thumb of a pimp.

1248
02:08:16,064 --> 02:08:18,857
To have you and what you stood for,

1249
02:08:23,738 --> 02:08:26,031
I got you down to my level.

1250
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:29,785
Just like all the others.

1251
02:08:30,912 --> 02:08:34,915
Reduced to a load of gangsters.

1252
02:08:36,209 --> 02:08:40,003
We made criminals out of all of you.

1253
02:08:40,088 --> 02:08:41,505
Murderers, thieves,

1254
02:08:41,589 --> 02:08:44,091
corrupted accomplices...

1255
02:08:46,803 --> 02:08:48,470
and...

1256
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:51,264
I believe you.

1257
02:08:52,266 --> 02:08:54,267
But let's not talk about that now.

1258
02:08:55,937 --> 02:08:58,313
Touch me here.

1259
02:09:00,983 --> 02:09:03,151
Make me come.

1260
02:09:03,236 --> 02:09:05,862
Let me feel your power.

1261
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:12,035
Whore.

1262
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:18,583
I made you, a whore, into one
of the first ladies of the Third Reich.

1263
02:09:18,668 --> 02:09:20,877
Pimp.

1264
02:09:21,712 --> 02:09:26,424
A whore and a pimp
who salute each other in public.

1265
02:09:26,509 --> 02:09:28,176
