1
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,899
Heil Hitler!

2
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,901
Heil Hitler.

3
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,572
Are we ready, Wallenberg?

4
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,451
Finally!
When?

5
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,917
It's a matter of days.

6
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,591
At Blitzkrieg. And we'll win it.

7
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,765
The Fuehrer has predicted
how long it will last precisely.

8
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,260
Guess!

9
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,933
One year. Six months.
At the most, two months.

10
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,806
We won't even have enough
time to enjoy it.

11
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,275
We'll enjoy the time after the war,
commander.

12
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:55,117
Gentlemen, cheers to the war,
Germany, the Fuehrer. Sieg Heil.

13
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,675
Wallenberg!

14
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,123
I need at least 20 girls.

15
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,889
It'd be easy for you to find them,
except they can't just be beautiful...

16
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,330
...they also have to be intelligent...

17
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,892
...and especially of indisputable
national socialist belief.

18
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,168
You must comb through all Germany,
through every city, every region.

19
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:47,003
Sift through the countryside, the
factories, the universities, the offices...

20
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,843
...middle class or blue collar,
housewives or employed women...

21
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,644
...virgins or married ones,
examine them carefully.

22
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,690
But most of all, I repeat, choose them
based on their political belief system.

23
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,870
Heil Hitler!

24
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:44,060
These three anatomical exhibits
are the best evidence that...

25
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,401
...the racial theory,
the essence of Nazi ideology...

26
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,739
...is based on scientific data
that has been rigorously tested.

27
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,783
Vices and corruption of an inferior race
are passed on...

28
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,414
...from generation to generation
by the chromosomes.

29
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,723
For example, the pigmentation of
this Negro is directly related to...

30
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:20,636
...the bestiality of his race and to
the impossibility to render it civil.

31
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,770
He died in physical stupor in a fire fight
with the police. Turn him around.

32
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,614
Instead, as we'll see,
this prostitute...

33
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:43,259
This prostitute, who died
during an attempted abortion...

34
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,296
...is of pure Aryan race.

35
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,658
In spite of the vices of her profession
and the corruption of her life...

36
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,706
...this corpse,
even in the rigidity of death...

37
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:59,210
...keeps all those typical
characteristics of a superior race.

38
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,135
Are there any questions?

39
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,044
Professor, is it true that
Jesus Christ was son of...

40
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,313
...a Roman prostitute
and a German soldier?

41
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,977
Without a doubt!

42
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:15,152
There can't be found the slightest trace
of Jewish characteristics in Jesus Christ.

43
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,491
He was blond with blue eyes...

44
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,930
...typical signs of his German origin.

45
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,535
Can you tell me who was the first man
in the world, who realized this fact...

46
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,233
...and revealed it to the human race?

47
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,074
Yes, sir. Our Fuehrer.
Adolf Hitler.

48
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:40,776
He promised to free us in 6 months from
the Communists and the trade-unions...

49
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,446
...and he kept his promise!

50
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,575
Today Nazi Law is socially the most
advanced one on earth...

51
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,280
...much more than the Fascist Code
in Italy.

52
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,583
And so Italian!

53
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,450
I admire the Italians, mom!

54
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,590
Me, too, my darling.
They are more Mediterranean...

55
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,898
...but very likeable.

56
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,271
They are a bit too exotic,
too colorful for my taste.

57
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,169
But in our party there is
a lack of style as well.

58
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,405
All these brown shirts,
it's such a vulgar color!

59
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:19,109
And his manners, my dear.
Did you notice how he drinks his tea?

60
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,913
By lifting the little pinky up.

61
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,522
Miss Enkel, you are forgetting, just as
often as my dad and mom forget...

62
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,325
...the National Socialist cannot waste
any time on learning proper etiquette.

63
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,399
They are too busy re-establishing
order, which you can't stand up for...

64
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:43,305
...because you're too busy controlling
your pinky and choosing your colors.

65
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,638
Don't you realize that you are
a generation of dead people?

66
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,644
Good night!

67
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,660
National Socialism is still a great charm!

68
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:10,364
That's basically what we were hoping for
when we supported Hitler in 1933, right?

69
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,563
The most important thing is
to be on the side of victory, right?

70
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,733
Well... on history's side, my dear!

71
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,740
Cheers!

72
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,832
Cheers!

73
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,311
"Not for Jews"

74
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,780
The Fuehrer is asking
every one of you the following:

75
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,643
To contribute with your own means
to the military effort...

76
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,655
...for the triumph of
National Socialism of Germany.

77
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,158
It would have been easier
to choose prostitutes...

78
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,256
...but the Fuehrer has put all of his trust
in the political belief system...

79
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,094
...rather than their various techniques.

80
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,693
If there is good will, it'll be
easy to learn the technique fast.

81
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,832
It's like killing.

82
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,165
The first time one may feel remorse...

83
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,673
...be induced to vomit,
even have insomnia.

84
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,241
But by the third time,
one sleeps peacefully.

85
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,547
By the fifth time, one eats a sandwich.

86
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:19,090
Actually, it gets exciting,
there is a stimulus.

87
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,323
They are just the same for you.

88
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,752
Heil Hitler.

89
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,355
Heil Hitler!

90
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,735
Comrades, take off your uniforms.

91
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:24,579
You will now undergo a group exam
by the SS of the Third Reich.

92
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,485
This will serve to free you
from your inhibitions...

93
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,928
...to be more flexible in your service.

94
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,433
The best will be submitted to
a second test...

95
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,264
...a more detailed, more specific one.

96
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:53,445
This test was developed expressly for
you by our Center of Psychosomatics.

97
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,284
Your duty consists in rejecting nothing.

98
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,620
Coitus. Anal coitus.

99
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,622
Masturbation. And fellatio.

100
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,228
Attention comrades!

101
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,572
Have fun, comrades!
Arouse your own fantasy.

102
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,774
The Fuehrer and the Homeland
make use even of this.

103
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,709
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

104
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,828
Turn to the right!

105
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,361
March, right, left, right, left...

106
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:53,503
...two, three, four, right, left,
two, three, four, left, right!

107
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,412
Keep your distance, man!

108
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:03,817
Right, left, left, two, three, four, left!

109
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,085
Keep your distance!

110
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,424
Stop! Turn to the right!

111
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,657
Stand straight!

112
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,814
Go to the right.
Go on! Let's go!

113
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,792
Take a girl! Get up there!

114
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,626
Go on! Over here!

115
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,906
Marika. She is perfect!

116
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,976
Splendid ability to adapt, I must say!

117
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,517
Olga from Hamburg.

118
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,111
No.

119
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,543
Martha from Danzig.

120
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,311
Rejected!

121
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,756
Margherita from Leipzig.

122
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,360
Approved!

123
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,959
Lena from Düsseldorf.

124
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,040
- What is he?
- A gypsy.

125
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,714
Weak. Mediocre. No sense of race.

126
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,322
- Is she surely Aryan?
- Yes.

127
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,416
What a shame!

128
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,720
Susan from Berlin.

129
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,758
Courageous. Decisive.

130
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,920
Great in battle!
Unshakable belief in National Socialism!

131
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,660
Approved!
Are there any more?

132
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,600
That's all of them, Commander.

133
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,272
I wanted to ask you what
we should do with the rejects.

134
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,838
Girls can be sent to the disciplinary
and re-education centers.

135
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,105
The men...

136
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:20,649
Dear Klaus, we cannot leave any
mouths behind that can talk.

137
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,785
Except that they can still be
useful in the work camps...

138
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,089
...or to Dr. Savage for his experiments.

139
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,630
Your problem, Klaus...

140
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,400
...is you always want to prove
you have a better idea than anyone.

141
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,969
Let me repeat: Do exactly as I told you!

142
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,407
- Heil!
- Heil Hitler!

143
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,066
Where are you going?
Who are you looking for?

144
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,331
They are all the same!

145
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,917
What scares you the most?
Is it what you eat or what you drink?

146
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,848
Nothing scares me.

147
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,595
The paintings that were hanging here
were degenerate art...

148
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,768
...expressionistic, French stuff...

149
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,137
...and Jewish culture.

150
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,845
Thank you.
I'd prefer a cup of tea.

151
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,446
Hey.

152
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,454
Those decadent habits of
the upper middle class!

153
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:17,296
No, quite the contrary.
Those from the upper class drink a lot.

154
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,465
I am angry like our Fuehrer.

155
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:24,200
Your damn middle class pride!
You haven't changed.

156
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,972
You are the same way you were
when you were born.

157
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,746
I believe in National Socialism.

158
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:43,152
Believing is not enough.
In order to be a real National Socialist...

159
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:47,322
...you have to know how to
give yourself over, your origins.

160
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,825
You must be able to compromise
all the way.

161
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,999
You have to humble yourself,
in order to be...

162
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,166
...reborn.

163
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,519
Leave.

164
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,851
Goodbye. Nice meeting you.

165
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,924
What do I have to do,
to give myself up?

166
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,202
You must humble yourself.

167
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,903
How?

168
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,558
Take off your underwear.

169
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,000
Hurry up!

170
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,410
Lift your skirt.

171
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,004
Higher.

172
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,740
Higher!

173
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,750
Much higher!

174
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,044
Go over there.

175
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,750
On your knees.

176
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,419
On your knees!

177
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,829
Like a bitch on four legs.
And now come here!

178
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,932
Crawl.

179
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,275
Hurry up. Hurry up! Much faster!

180
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,785
You see, you are nothing.

181
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:59,586
Just a bitch.
A bitch controlled by me.

182
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:08,296
I like how you resist.
I like your dignity, your pride.

183
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,336
Go on.

184
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,805
Share yourself with me.

185
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,309
I'll share my power with you!

186
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,157
I disgust you.
Kiss me. Kiss me!

187
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,830
Do something, God! I am not part
of your world, right? Tell me.

188
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,607
You are part of a more precious world.

189
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,499
September 1, 1939
Declaration of war on Poland

190
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,841
Long live Zorro! Heil Hitler!

191
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,438
Heil Hitler!

192
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,613
Max, Klaus, Darling!

193
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,212
Champagne for everyone!
It's on the house.

194
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,683
Champagne, a kiss from Kitty!
From Kitty in person!

195
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,623
And discounts for the soldiers
on leave!

196
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,770
Are you talking about the cripples?

197
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,310
Oh, stop it, please!

198
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,821
Right now we're already dealing with
the first injuries and deaths of this war.

199
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:17,050
Young blond, romantic men suffering
next to the corpses of their horses...

200
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,322
...or near the wrecks of their tanks!

201
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,492
A heroic image, right, Cliff?

202
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,534
Dino! If there weren't any dead,
there wouldn't be a war...

203
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,502
...and Germany would not be able to
win and dominate the world!

204
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,904
And we wouldn't be here having
champagne and such a good time.

205
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,105
Well said! Cliff is much more fun
than you are, dear Dino.

206
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,579
He makes even more sense.

207
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,776
His America is further away from
Berlin than my city of Naples.

208
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:52,353
My friends! Girls! Gentlemen!

209
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,027
Play the National anthem immediately!
Otherwise be the conductor.

210
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,856
You are the usual party pooper.

211
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,927
Come over.
Today I stopped rationing champagne.

212
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,363
If you are not interested in my girls,
I think you will be in the champagne.

213
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:05,095
Forgive me, Kitty, but I can't.
I have tens of thousands of things to do.

214
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,534
I'll send you a car.

215
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,732
And put what inside of it?
Girls or champagne?

216
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:11,864
Just you.

217
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,405
Thank you, that's flattering, darling.

218
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,506
But it's been a while since I stopped
offering services so that I can get killed.

219
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,518
Well, as I told you, if you come over,
I'll be happy.

220
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,612
If not, you can keep your ass
glued to the chair. Bye!

221
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,059
Klaus?

222
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,705
The Gestapo!

223
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,612
Are you crazy?

224
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:17,113
You let those Gestapo brings me here
like a criminal, in order to tell me what?

225
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,486
That you have to commit my girls,
because they are foreigners...

226
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,527
...and close my nightclub?
The Party needs my place.

227
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,029
It's not up to me.

228
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,532
And whom the fuck would it be up to?
Himmler, Von Riebentrop?

229
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,435
They are all my clients, except you.
Have they gone crazy, too?

230
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,403
I'll make a call to all of them immediately.
I'll show you who Kitty is!

231
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,377
Do you think this is the right day, Kitty?
The war has just started.

232
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,945
What the fuck does the war
have to do with my work?

233
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,043
Do you want us to wear a chastity belt
just because the war has started?

234
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,714
Do you want my girls to
become little red swastikas?

235
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,022
Wallenberg, you haven't learned
a thing from the Roman Empire.

236
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,122
In order to conquer the World
one must be able to laugh, sing.

237
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,469
Unless you have no intent to close the
brothel, only to open a singing school.

238
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,067
Thank you very much, Kitty.

239
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:15,240
But our valuable soldiers are already
singing about Germany's greatness.

240
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,574
Don't you think our valuable soldiers...

241
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:26,084
...would like to spend half an hour
in bed in order to come...

242
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,581
...before they leave?

243
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:34,160
But of course. But don't forget that
many of them are married.

244
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,490
Married!
The wives are for breast-feeding.

245
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,928
A soldier also wants to shoot his bullets,
not just those the army gives him.

246
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,466
Wallenberg. Sometimes I feel
you don't understand these things.

247
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,938
Is that just because I am not
interested in your whores?

248
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,949
But that's not the point.
There is nothing I can do.

249
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,448
I am sorry, Kitty.
You have to close your nightclub.

250
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,784
What a pain in the ass!
You can ruin me this way!

251
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,057
At least give me some more time.
6 months?

252
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:15,638
Not even a day. I told you.
The Party needs that place.

253
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,980
But I could help you.

254
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,156
I could provide you with German girls.

255
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,622
You could get a little villa
in the Green Forest.

256
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,899
I thank you, but Kitty has always
been at the center of Berlin...

257
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,831
...and she has always used
an international set of girls.

258
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,005
You are making a big mistake, Kitty.

259
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,840
I would give you skillful, beautiful,
and elegant girls...

260
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:03,181
...in a private, quiet, discreet area.

261
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,424
Really a high-class place.

262
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,517
I'd even offer you a great price.

263
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,095
And if I refuse?

264
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,029
I don't think that's a good idea.

265
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,632
I really don't think it's a good idea.
You wouldn't just lose your license.

266
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,878
Evidently you still don't know me,
Commander.

267
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:39,220
If necessary, I'll go to Hitler myself!

268
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,400
Don't move. Nobody move!

269
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,207
They will miss...
They'll miss this panoramic view.

270
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,294
Schatzi, I don't care about
changing my address.

271
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,132
Love is the same everywhere.
Thank Heavens.

272
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,630
I don't have to change my profession,
I don't have to find someone else.

273
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,541
After it's all over, he'll send me to a villa.

274
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,473
I'm such a mess!

275
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,815
What's the matter? Are you crying?

276
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,651
Yes, and I don't know why.

277
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:29,156
I don't know. I swear I don't know why,
stupid girl I am.

278
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,340
For Heaven's sake, girls, relax!

279
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,347
We are not in the army.

280
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:52,548
Frankie, bring something to drink.
Something strong. It's freezing in here.

281
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,215
Good girls, very good!

282
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,361
They can certainly listen very well,
Wallenberg, but that's not enough.

283
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,929
They come off as amateurs.
Look at this one.

284
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,128
Good for a trip to the country,
but not for fucking like a pig.

285
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,694
Look at this one!

286
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,137
A child in her arms...

287
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,236
...and an iron in her hands,
and you'll have the perfect homemaker.

288
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,040
They have no passion!

289
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,150
This one is so refined, she even
makes me feel uncomfortable.

290
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,446
Imagine the poor guy
who has to screw her!

291
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,022
She's made for a parlor,
not for a nightclub.

292
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,422
What we need here are girls,
who are soft and warm and...

293
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,984
...most of all always ready
and able to smile in any situation.

294
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,389
Technically they are perfect.

295
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,397
I hope they don't greet their clients
when they enter the room.

296
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:46,067
I felt so at peace with my other girls.
They could give a dying man a hard on!

297
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:52,911
All right, loosen them up.
After all that's your job, not mine.

298
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:58,414
They say you've been extraordinary.
Teach them to become like you.

299
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:20,174
No, no, no. They are all beautiful,
perfect, too perfect, boring.

300
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,111
They look like printed postcards
the soldiers send to their moms.

301
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:29,442
I need specialists -
girls who can satisfy any request...

302
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:34,616
...to fulfill the strangest desires,
the most complex perversions.

303
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,793
The clients of Salon Kitty
have imagination.

304
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,294
If any of them doesn't not live up to
your expectations, let me know.

305
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,198
I'm responsible for them all.

306
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:59,642
Who would have known that.
We'll have to take up teaching.

307
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,817
Bravo!

308
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,264
Perfect!

309
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,663
And now, Wallenberg,
this is your battle point.

310
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,832
You don't rush and do your work
meticulously.

311
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:08,948
I want to control the girls' relationships
and collect any information they gather.

312
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,179
To trust is fine; to not trust is better.

313
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,689
Execute my orders to the letter
to the best of your ability.

314
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,628
And, have fun, Wallenberg.

315
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,030
- What's your name?
- Susan, General.

316
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,831
Why do you look at me this way?

317
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:34,200
You're looking at me as if you know
we have known each other for years.

318
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,212
All Germany knows you, General!

319
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,878
You are the conqueror
and destroyer of Poland.

320
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,976
You can also destroy my body
with these, General.

321
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,062
Don't talk about Poland.

322
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,794
War is a sacred thing - besides,
it's too big to fit in this room.

323
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,138
Put on my boots.

324
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,231
Sure, General!

325
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,774
- Do you know how to sing?
- Yes, General!

326
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,744
Well, then march and sing!

327
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,251
Is that fine, General?

328
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,636
- Take off the pants!
- Of course, General!

329
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,535
And stop calling me General!

330
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,037
Call me Greta.

331
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:57,552
Do you like it? Can you feel it?
It burns, right?

332
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,960
Tell me that you like it.
Tell me that it burns!

333
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:06,633
Spread them! Take it, yes, yes!
Take it!

334
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:11,805
It's of a comrade, a top General of
the Duce, by the name of Cavelucci.

335
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,301
Tell me you like it.
Tell me it burns you!

336
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:20,878
Tell me it's killing you!
That it's splitting you in half!

337
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:25,250
Tell me, tell me
it's splitting you in half!

338
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,823
Give it to me! Give it to me!

339
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,859
- Tell me it's killing you, tell me!
- You're killing me! Give it to me!

340
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,258
- Tell me, it's killing you!
- Give it to me!

341
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,332
Tell me!
Tell me, tell me, and tell me!!

342
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,507
Yeah, I like it very much!

343
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,337
I'm the infamous woman! Oh, yes!

344
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,679
Later on!

345
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,690
I like it!

346
00:56:56,413 --> 00:57:05,412
You'll notice in a month or two, if I am
right, the military bases will change.

347
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:14,091
The British will start telling us that
in Oslo and Copenhagen...

348
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,159
...the language will be English,
my favorite project!

349
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,104
English is a nice language!

350
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,834
A tongue for your huge cunt,
and a beautiful ass.

351
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:33,438
Klaus! Type the report with
the very same words.

352
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,280
The first copy is for the Chancellery.

353
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,619
The other is for the Reich fuehrer
Himmler - urgent, an absolute priority!

354
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,957
Without checking it first?

355
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,929
Klaus, how many times do I have to
repeat not to be zealous?

356
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,126
I assume total responsibility
for this operation!

357
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,464
Personally!

358
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:34,003
Honestly, I was skeptical.
Material coming from who knows where!

359
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,406
Girls who are not ready.
They made me spit blood.

360
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,005
I swear that for a few days
I expected a catastrophe!

361
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,410
But now it's sold out every evening!

362
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,513
You can see from the champagne!
Now it can be found only at your place.

363
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,521
I know where to get it.
Riebentrop is my friend.

364
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,528
Oh, well, then it's him
who gets you this, right?!

365
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,967
Are you from the front?

366
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,577
You made love to me
as if you hated me.

367
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:51,981
No, that's not true.

368
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,578
Would you like to do some more?

369
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,014
Always.

370
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:58,816
Me, too.

371
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,589
Of course. Of course.

372
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,495
It's your profession.

373
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,600
It's a pity, though, that
you don't know what it means.

374
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,935
Why are you here?

375
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,343
Are you on leave?
Don't you want to talk?

376
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,611
I like to screw.

377
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,445
But if you are not into it...

378
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,087
I am into it, too.

379
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,089
That's not true.

380
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,633
Why do you say such a thing?

381
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,795
It's not true.

382
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,570
But in the end I don't care.
You are here for this, right?

383
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,639
So, open your legs.

384
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,150
With pleasure.

385
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,998
Not that way.

386
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,673
No. Without anger.

387
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,736
With tenderness.

388
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,778
Let yourself go.

389
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,273
Margherita's report.

390
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:41,089
Hans Reiter,
lieutenant of the Luftwaffe...

391
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:46,420
...on leave from the front,
not willing to talk.

392
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,423
He only wanted to make love.

393
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,157
He made love more than once.

394
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,479
You're beautiful.

395
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:49,488
Even if you are just a whore,
making love with you is nice. I like it.

396
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,295
I hate life.

397
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,825
But I have nothing against you.

398
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,162
Are you on leave for a medal?

399
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,907
Yes, so that I can hang it
on my shoulder.

400
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,177
Are you still going to fight?

401
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,419
Maybe I'm not a good soldier.

402
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,518
When do you have to leave?

403
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,192
Soon. In 10 days.

404
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,530
That's an eternity for making love.

405
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,197
Yes, an eternity that ends too soon.

406
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:50,714
If I could take you with me, so that
I can screw you anytime I want to...

407
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,382
It's really nice with you.

408
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,286
You're exaggerating.

409
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,058
Do you regret not coming along?

410
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:11,105
No. It's just that it's unfair
when you are exaggerating.

411
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,244
Would you regret it, if I fell in love
with you... just a little bit?

412
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,245
Do you think it's ridiculous?

413
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:29,151
Love is a word used by a man and
a woman spending time in bed together.

414
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,090
Sure, sure, sure.

415
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,287
Hurry, hurry, over here!
Get into the shelter!

416
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,225
Where is the shelter?!

417
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,456
Over here! Hurry up!

418
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:16,004
To the shelter!
Hurry, hurry, and hurry.

419
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,629
Over here!

420
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,347
Congratulations!

421
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,532
Congratulations to myself
for having found you.

422
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,032
I have a gift for you
before I return to the battle.

423
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,825
I saw light underneath the door.
Aren't you afraid?

424
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:48,693
The British will never bomb Berlin.
Marshall Behring himself told us so.

425
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,460
That's not a good reason for
getting drunk completely naked.

426
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,065
- Would you like to drink with us?
- With pleasure.

427
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,568
- Today is a very important anniversary.
- Of what?

428
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,871
It's exactly a week now
Margherita and I know each other.

429
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,670
I wish you hundreds of these days!
The same to you, Margherita.

430
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,090
I don't like anniversaries.
I only like to drink champagne...

431
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,024
...with him, or maybe
not even with him.

432
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,430
I love champagne, and that's all
there is to it.

433
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,696
Too many good wishes are
a bad omen.

434
01:09:50,304 --> 01:09:52,295
Why? Hans!?

435
01:09:53,741 --> 01:09:58,701
What did I do wrong?
Hans! Hans.

436
01:10:05,352 --> 01:10:08,788
Departure for Kronewald from
platform 1.

437
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:14,383
The train!

438
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:28,936
The next train for Kronewald will leave
in 20 minutes from platform 1.

439
01:10:38,352 --> 01:10:42,254
Left, left, two, three, four.

440
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,590
Man, you are not doing it right.

441
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,068
Why, Hans? Why?

442
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,310
From lmola to Warsaw...

443
01:11:48,422 --> 01:11:54,486
Demolished houses, burned fields,
dead horses rotting in the sun.

444
01:11:55,162 --> 01:11:58,654
And men, women, children,
piles of corpses.

445
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:02,593
Silent deformed bodies,
bloated and decomposed.

446
01:12:02,703 --> 01:12:04,694
We slaughtered everybody!

447
01:12:05,172 --> 01:12:08,039
I, too, beat these poor citizens,
who couldn't defend themselves.

448
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:11,168
People screaming,
with their arms up in the air.

449
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:13,269
Was I born for this?

450
01:12:16,617 --> 01:12:20,348
I thought my future was building houses,
creating space to live and make love...

451
01:12:20,454 --> 01:12:24,584
...but instead I've become
the architect of a graveyard.

452
01:12:27,528 --> 01:12:29,519
No, Hans. No!

453
01:12:30,197 --> 01:12:32,893
Margherita! Margherita!

454
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:02,859
My God, Hans.
Now here, love me.

455
01:13:44,037 --> 01:13:47,871
Now you're starting to understand
what your despair is about, right?

456
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:51,636
It's our last day. Stop talking.

457
01:13:56,817 --> 01:13:59,377
I'm sick of slaughtering human beings.

458
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:03,215
But you're a soldier.
It's your duty to fight.

459
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:07,783
Of course. I kept my head down
without discussing why until yesterday.

460
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:10,095
But I have made my decision now.

461
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:14,797
I want to fight against Hitler...

462
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:17,798
...against his madness...

463
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:21,836
...against this violence,
which is corrupting us all.

464
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:24,410
Lieutenant Hans Reiter stopped by
today as well, before leaving.

465
01:14:24,511 --> 01:14:25,944
What do you have in mind?

466
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:33,317
As soon as I'm back on the base,
I'll defect on my airplane.

467
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,409
That's treason!

468
01:14:35,756 --> 01:14:39,419
He said very little - almost nothing.
Little bits of sentences.

469
01:14:39,526 --> 01:14:42,620
He is the reserved type,
but a genuine and honest person...

470
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:45,822
...always confident in his
National Socialist belief.

471
01:14:51,839 --> 01:14:55,707
Margherita. Man belongs to mankind.

472
01:14:56,944 --> 01:15:00,573
Not to a country,
to a race or a religion.

473
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,215
I'm at peace with myself.

474
01:15:08,322 --> 01:15:12,088
He kept wanting to make love.
And we did as it is the right thing to do...

475
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:15,389
...with a soldier who prepares himself
to go back to battle.

476
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:19,022
Margherita. Man belongs to mankind.

477
01:15:19,566 --> 01:15:23,195
Not to a country, or to a race or religion.

478
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:25,602
I'm at peace with myself.

479
01:15:25,706 --> 01:15:30,268
Did she write down in her report
the name of the officer for certain?

480
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:31,867
Yes, Commander.

481
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:34,536
Captain Hans Reiter.

482
01:15:41,054 --> 01:15:44,888
He is precise and faithful.

483
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:47,550
He'll get back to the base today.

484
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:53,393
Take care of this immediately!

485
01:15:58,071 --> 01:16:00,403
Yes, Commander.

486
01:16:01,642 --> 01:16:04,475
Captain Hans Reiter.
Have you fallen in love with him?

487
01:16:04,745 --> 01:16:05,643
No.

488
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:11,583
Go ahead, drink. I'm sure by now you've
also learned to love champagne.

489
01:16:12,753 --> 01:16:14,550
You met with him everyday, correct?

490
01:16:14,755 --> 01:16:16,416
It was he looking for me.

491
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:21,524
And you? Is that it,
you only spread your legs?

492
01:16:24,932 --> 01:16:27,662
I told you to come in only if I call you!

493
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:28,732
Get out!

494
01:16:29,102 --> 01:16:32,663
Goodbye, Miss.
I'm Mrs. Wallenberg.

495
01:16:35,075 --> 01:16:37,066
I married her a long time ago.

496
01:16:38,078 --> 01:16:41,946
I must say she is a great wife -
discreet, faithful.

497
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:45,674
Get out!

498
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,049
No, wait!

499
01:16:57,431 --> 01:17:01,299
lmagine her as Hans Reiter.

500
01:17:02,602 --> 01:17:04,593
Show me what you did to him...

501
01:17:06,139 --> 01:17:07,970
...because it's not in your reports.

502
01:17:08,075 --> 01:17:12,205
What's the matter? Is your pride
keeping you from doing it?

503
01:19:31,284 --> 01:19:32,012
Stop it!

504
01:19:35,922 --> 01:19:36,911
Go away!

505
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:43,058
I didn't expect you'd get caught
in the net of silly sentimentality.

506
01:19:43,163 --> 01:19:44,528
Maybe I overestimated you.

507
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:46,792
Why? Who do you think I am?

508
01:19:47,134 --> 01:19:50,297
Your Hans will never understand
what you are!

509
01:19:50,403 --> 01:19:52,064
What does he give you?

510
01:19:52,172 --> 01:19:53,161
And you?

511
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:56,372
Look!

512
01:20:00,147 --> 01:20:01,136
Look here!

513
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,877
Look here!

514
01:20:08,155 --> 01:20:10,123
You see?

515
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:23,168
I'll take everything
that can be sold.

516
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:26,969
It'll be mine, like you.

517
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:32,968
I want you too to become
part of my private dream.

518
01:20:33,547 --> 01:20:35,538
Another ghost like your wife?

519
01:20:37,684 --> 01:20:40,517
A desire. And it's your duty.

520
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:46,658
Do I have to lose my body,
and my whole self?

521
01:20:46,993 --> 01:20:51,191
Do you prefer to stay the way you are?
With your wretched little love story?

522
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:56,535
I aim higher. That's why I am a
National Socialist.

523
01:20:57,204 --> 01:20:59,138
I have a goal: Power!

524
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,131
And with you,
my power will be complete.

525
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:08,040
What is your ridiculous love for
the pilot compared to all of this?

526
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:09,604
It's not love.

527
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:17,879
Look.

528
01:21:18,892 --> 01:21:20,189
I have a letter from him.

529
01:21:33,106 --> 01:21:34,596
I could destroy it.

530
01:21:47,387 --> 01:21:52,586
Heinzberg, n. 10. My Love:
I just got here less than an hour ago...

531
01:21:52,926 --> 01:21:59,490
...and I already miss you,
need you, want you.

532
01:22:03,703 --> 01:22:08,265
It did not go through censorship.
Nobody else read it. Just you.

533
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:13,602
As you can see, if I want to,
I can do anything, you know?

534
01:22:14,781 --> 01:22:15,770
I know.

535
01:22:15,882 --> 01:22:20,148
I can treat feelings as if they were things.
Isn't that great?

536
01:22:20,954 --> 01:22:25,288
Yes. It's true. It's wonderful. Like magic.

537
01:22:25,492 --> 01:22:30,293
It's will, not magic.
And that goes for you, too.

538
01:22:31,464 --> 01:22:33,295
You are mine, because I want it.

539
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,636
By now you belong to me -
you've become mine.

540
01:22:38,471 --> 01:22:42,464
The one I protect. My accomplice.

541
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:49,611
Say it! Say that you are my accomplice.
Say it! Say it!

542
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:50,705
Yes.

543
01:22:54,654 --> 01:22:59,148
You're mine. Betray him.

544
01:23:01,027 --> 01:23:06,124
My love, you're mine, I miss you,
I need you, I want you.

545
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:10,601
I miss you, I need you, I want you.

546
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:52,077
The lonely butterfly.

547
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:54,244
I don't like clowning around.

548
01:23:54,347 --> 01:23:57,214
If you are skillful, you'll get rich fast.

549
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,317
You are so special -
that's why the neurotics like you.

550
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:01,750
You only think about money.

551
01:24:01,855 --> 01:24:04,722
Sure, honey, what else can you think of
in this profession.

552
01:24:04,858 --> 01:24:07,452
After you've made enough of it,
you drop everything...

553
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,358
...go free and go back to being
a respectable and proper person.

554
01:24:10,497 --> 01:24:15,059
You really think like a servant.
You have no ideals.

555
01:24:15,502 --> 01:24:17,732
You are no National Socialist.

556
01:24:22,075 --> 01:24:26,102
My dear Susan,
first of all I am a madam.

557
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:30,281
In spite of your ideals, Hitler,
your husband, your daughter...

558
01:24:30,383 --> 01:24:33,580
...you're nothing but a whore.
A whore!

559
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:37,317
I am not, I am not,
and I am not!

560
01:24:42,595 --> 01:24:44,187
Stop! Stop!!

561
01:24:56,443 --> 01:24:57,432
Jesus and Mary!

562
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:05,615
The profession of a whore seems
easy, comfortable, full of luxury.

563
01:25:05,718 --> 01:25:09,415
Many of them fall into this trap.
When they realize that, it's too late.

564
01:25:09,489 --> 01:25:11,719
Well. My dear Hilda, dear Hilda.

565
01:25:18,298 --> 01:25:19,788
Aren't you taking off your clothes?

566
01:25:29,809 --> 01:25:30,798
Ok.

567
01:25:37,984 --> 01:25:42,819
Go over to the bed. Go to the bed.

568
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:55,656
Turn off the light.

569
01:26:14,854 --> 01:26:18,847
...by joining the political
leadership of our Party.

570
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:25,195
And then those two institutions will
together educate the German people...

571
01:26:25,298 --> 01:26:30,361
...render them powerful, and they will
carry the German state...

572
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,529
...the German empire
on their shoulders.

573
01:26:39,546 --> 01:26:43,812
...and that one would admit
the truth about Germany...

574
01:26:44,717 --> 01:26:45,911
- What is this?
- Bread.

575
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:55,017
I had it prepared by the best baker
in Berlin. It's perfect, isn't it?

576
01:26:56,896 --> 01:26:59,956
Put it between your legs. Not inside.
On the outside!

577
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:04,334
Now I'll hold it steady, so that
it really looks like it's yours.

578
01:27:04,571 --> 01:27:08,701
Stroke it, stroke it. Come on!
Work with me!

579
01:27:09,409 --> 01:27:11,400
Good girl, good girl!

580
01:27:39,772 --> 01:27:49,044
Heil Hitler! Shit! Heil Hitler!
Ass! Shit! Heil Hitler! Sieg Heil!

581
01:27:49,148 --> 01:27:55,348
Sieg Heil! Shit! Shit! Sieg Heil! Shit!
Sieg Heil! Heil Hitler! Shit! Shit! Sieg Heil

582
01:29:01,521 --> 01:29:06,322
Poor girl. I should have told you.
I should have refused to work like this.

583
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,949
Calm down!

584
01:29:09,862 --> 01:29:13,195
I'm sure there won't be
any more incidents of this kind.

585
01:29:13,966 --> 01:29:17,299
In any event, contact me immediately.
I'll take care of it personally.

586
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:18,836
Like you did today?

587
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:21,436
Like I did today.

588
01:29:30,683 --> 01:29:34,676
What are you looking at?
Leave while there is still enough time!

589
01:29:34,887 --> 01:29:41,417
This life is despicable, of shit, vomit,
come, urine, of pigs, of fools.

590
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:43,256
Leave! Leave!

591
01:29:54,373 --> 01:29:57,740
And you. Especially you.

592
01:29:59,045 --> 01:30:03,379
What need drives you to be
so humiliated by men?

593
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:08,251
You are so beautiful, so delicate.

594
01:30:08,921 --> 01:30:11,253
Save yourself, Margherita.

595
01:30:12,258 --> 01:30:16,160
Anything is better than this life.
Save yourself.

596
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,419
Save yourself.

597
01:30:34,447 --> 01:30:36,779
How were you able to
keep it hidden until now?

598
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:38,678
Close-fitting clothes.

599
01:30:39,051 --> 01:30:42,714
When I took my clothes off,
it was easy - no one cared.

600
01:30:42,955 --> 01:30:45,788
I could do it until a few days ago,
but now...

601
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,797
You should've informed us immediately.
Why haven't you done so?

602
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:53,789
I want to keep the baby.

603
01:30:55,635 --> 01:30:56,624
It's mine.

604
01:30:59,105 --> 01:31:00,129
And the father?

605
01:31:01,107 --> 01:31:01,835
It's mine!

606
01:31:02,475 --> 01:31:07,208
Are you saying you want to keep
a child from government control?

607
01:31:07,814 --> 01:31:12,547
Have you forgotten that
you're still a member of our SS?

608
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:14,875
It's mine.

609
01:31:26,032 --> 01:31:30,696
Psychologically the girl is lost as to what
her mission objectives are.

610
01:31:34,507 --> 01:31:38,170
We cannot leave a whore like
her around. She knows too much.

611
01:31:40,513 --> 01:31:43,038
Dear doctor, the solution is your job.

612
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:45,005
Heil Hitler!

613
01:32:25,558 --> 01:32:29,551
You're Margherita, right?
Hans Reiter's girlfriend.

614
01:32:30,563 --> 01:32:33,589
We were in the same squadron.
He talked a lot about you.

615
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:35,690
Yes, I know him.
He has been here.

616
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:41,865
Did you know
he was in love with you?

617
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:45,238
Those things can happen.
Fortunately he got over it fast.

618
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:47,638
I don't think so. Actually...

619
01:33:00,593 --> 01:33:03,926
Too bad. One should never
fall in love with someone like me.

620
01:33:06,766 --> 01:33:08,256
I am a whore.

621
01:33:30,356 --> 01:33:31,414
Where is he now?

622
01:33:32,058 --> 01:33:33,286
Why? Don't you know?

623
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:35,488
He was hanged...

624
01:33:35,962 --> 01:33:38,624
...a few days after he went back
to the base...

625
01:33:38,731 --> 01:33:41,962
...because of despondency
and anti-patriotism.

626
01:33:43,469 --> 01:33:47,963
It was an order from Berlin.
He was planning to desert.

627
01:33:49,008 --> 01:33:53,104
That pig!
We thought he was a good comrade.

628
01:33:56,015 --> 01:33:57,505
Instead he was a shit.

629
01:33:57,817 --> 01:34:02,982
He played a National Socialist with us,
then we found out he saw us as killers.

630
01:34:03,322 --> 01:34:07,452
What a coward, a traitor, no balls.
Fortunately he gave himself away.

631
01:34:10,262 --> 01:34:14,665
They hung him, that son of a bitch,
from a butcher's hook.

632
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:20,002
I enjoyed watching him dangle,
that bastard, like a slaughtered pig.

633
01:34:23,843 --> 01:34:27,677
I took the joy of spitting
on his dead body.

634
01:34:30,483 --> 01:34:33,475
- That sounded like a gunshot.
- Margherita! Help!

635
01:34:33,853 --> 01:34:35,514
Open up! What happened?

636
01:34:37,023 --> 01:34:39,719
- Margherita!
- Open up! Go get everybody!

637
01:35:17,563 --> 01:35:21,465
Put me through to Wallenberg's
office immediately!

638
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:26,901
Wallenberg, it's Kitty.
There's been an accident here.

639
01:35:27,907 --> 01:35:29,898
An officer killed himself
in the bathroom.

640
01:35:50,396 --> 01:35:52,626
When do you think
you are going back to Berlin?

641
01:35:53,432 --> 01:35:54,421
I don't know, mom.

642
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:58,097
Darling, are you on leave
because of your health?

643
01:35:59,371 --> 01:36:01,430
Yes. Let's call it that.

644
01:36:02,775 --> 01:36:06,108
It's a nervous breakdown
because of too much work.

645
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:10,442
And they are fine with that?
How do they think about it?

646
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,239
Who's they?

647
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:15,684
What do you know about them?
You don't even know what I do.

648
01:36:16,889 --> 01:36:23,260
All you know is that I left home one day.
You never found out what I was doing.

649
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:25,458
You never allowed me to.

650
01:36:25,564 --> 01:36:28,499
Nor did I allow you to register me
with my National Socialist Party.

651
01:36:28,601 --> 01:36:30,865
This was different.
Your father is being childish.

652
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:32,835
I still won't bring anyone with me.

653
01:36:32,905 --> 01:36:34,463
Yet, you despise us!

654
01:36:35,307 --> 01:36:36,296
That's true.

655
01:36:36,809 --> 01:36:41,303
I despise your hypocrisy -
your fear of knowing the truth.

656
01:36:41,547 --> 01:36:44,641
You hide in silence under
the pretext of law and order.

657
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,411
And of tradition!

658
01:36:46,519 --> 01:36:51,513
Tradition! Look at yourselves.
You are like two mummified insects.

659
01:36:51,824 --> 01:36:53,815
Why should people like you be saved?

660
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:58,322
For the future of Germany, my dear!
Our generation must preserve...

661
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,888
Preserve what? Your own skin?
Your own stuff?

662
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:07,604
Keeping your eyes shut, so you won't
see anything and won't have to think.

663
01:37:07,706 --> 01:37:11,005
A few months ago you were telling
a totally different story.

664
01:37:14,747 --> 01:37:15,907
For you, Miss.

665
01:37:16,315 --> 01:37:17,304
Who wants me?

666
01:37:18,317 --> 01:37:20,080
Madam Kitty Kellermann.

667
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,085
What? Kitty?

668
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:27,023
Tell her that I am not home. No, wait.
Have her sit down on the porch.

669
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,363
What type of work do you do
in Berlin, Margherita?

670
01:37:37,469 --> 01:37:42,031
Invent one yourself, dad,
one that keeps you most at peace.

671
01:37:47,313 --> 01:37:51,306
I understand you, darling. I would've
acted the same way in your place.

672
01:37:52,351 --> 01:37:55,843
But I cannot keep covering up for you.
Wallenberg wants you back.

673
01:37:57,056 --> 01:38:00,219
Now you're a pimp for Wallenberg,
aren't you?

674
01:38:02,528 --> 01:38:07,522
I'm nobody's pimp. Even less of
a politician like Wallenberg.

675
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:11,568
But don't forget that a German officer
was killed in your room.

676
01:38:12,071 --> 01:38:15,404
That's not just stupid, but also
dangerous considering who he is.

677
01:38:15,741 --> 01:38:18,676
Are you blackmailing me?
Let it be known that I don't care.

678
01:38:18,777 --> 01:38:21,007
Go ahead and tell him,
if you want.

679
01:38:21,113 --> 01:38:23,809
Tell him it was me -
I killed that pig to avenge Hans.

680
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:27,816
I didn't know you loved him that much.

681
01:38:32,024 --> 01:38:36,017
You don't need to come back tomorrow
nor the day after tomorrow.

682
01:38:36,729 --> 01:38:41,393
Rest a bit. In the meantime
I'll keep trying to calm the waters.

683
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,333
There's nothing to calm,
because I'm not coming back.

684
01:38:44,436 --> 01:38:45,994
Don't lie - that won't help.

685
01:38:46,105 --> 01:38:50,041
And write the report yourself:
Margherita Abandons Operation Kitty!

686
01:38:50,142 --> 01:38:50,836
What operation?

687
01:38:50,943 --> 01:38:53,275
The one that has people
hanging from butcher's hooks.

688
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:55,203
I don't know what you are
talking about.

689
01:38:55,314 --> 01:38:58,010
The operation you conduct, Kitty.
Yours is a brood of spies...

690
01:38:58,117 --> 01:39:02,451
...who drink champagne, screw, and
tell everything they hear to Wallenberg!

691
01:39:02,554 --> 01:39:05,489
That's not true. There is not
one trace of truth in your story.

692
01:39:05,591 --> 01:39:09,027
Stop playing the role of Kitty.
I don't ask you to justify yourself.

693
01:39:09,128 --> 01:39:12,029
I don't give a shit if you're
Wallenberg's accomplice or if I am!

694
01:39:12,131 --> 01:39:15,794
Me? Who really is the accomplice
of an SS captain?

695
01:39:16,468 --> 01:39:20,734
You betrayed me!
You spy, spy! Spy! Spy!!

696
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:25,634
Spy in my nightclub - an honest,
clean welcoming brothel!

697
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:28,912
I hate you! I hate you all!

698
01:39:29,048 --> 01:39:32,984
I never soiled myself
in all this political crap!

699
01:39:40,693 --> 01:39:44,129
People can do whatever
they want there.

700
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:47,328
The sex there is clean!

701
01:39:55,507 --> 01:39:57,168
Now I understand everything!

702
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:00,911
They changed the nightclub -
they changed the girls.

703
01:40:01,013 --> 01:40:03,004
They were hoping they could
change Kitty as well.

704
01:40:03,349 --> 01:40:05,044
I will kill that Wallenberg!

705
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:07,311
I'll destroy him,
I'll squash him like a worm!

706
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:13,358
I'll go to Hitler!
It really matters to me!

707
01:40:20,099 --> 01:40:23,728
Calm down, Kitty. Calm down.

708
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:26,802
I thought that you were on their side.

709
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:32,040
Am I so stupid. How could I have
ever thought the same about you.

710
01:40:32,811 --> 01:40:35,803
Forgive me. But...

711
01:40:36,281 --> 01:40:41,048
Kitty, how did Wallenberg know
every word I said in that room?

712
01:40:45,758 --> 01:40:47,248
We were by ourselves.

713
01:40:48,727 --> 01:40:51,127
How did he know about his feelings...

714
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:56,327
...his decision to switch sides?
They hung him for that reason.

715
01:40:57,403 --> 01:40:59,462
It was you who hung him on that hook.

716
01:40:59,571 --> 01:41:02,131
No, not Hans.

717
01:41:02,241 --> 01:41:05,733
I didn't write a single word in my report
about what Hans said to me.

718
01:41:07,846 --> 01:41:12,078
At first I didn't want to admit I loved him.
But now I know I do.

719
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:19,256
I understand what he meant by saying:
"I'm tired of slaughtering human beings."

720
01:41:20,359 --> 01:41:24,887
He was sure that I'd come to
understand that, too.

721
01:41:28,934 --> 01:41:32,597
Kitty! Would you want to be
on my side?

722
01:41:33,172 --> 01:41:35,606
No, never on that side.

723
01:41:35,908 --> 01:41:38,433
Don't you understand that I've changed?
I'm coming out of a nightmare.

724
01:41:38,544 --> 01:41:41,945
I need your help!
Make up your mind and wake up!

725
01:41:45,017 --> 01:41:49,010
I don't understand anything anymore -
absolutely nothing.

726
01:41:49,455 --> 01:41:54,119
Wasn't it you who said it's easier
to talk amongst women?

727
01:41:54,626 --> 01:41:55,615
Let's try.

728
01:41:58,130 --> 01:41:59,620
What would you like to do?

729
01:42:00,432 --> 01:42:03,026
lmmediately go back to Berlin,
immediately!

730
01:42:03,135 --> 01:42:08,630
Find out how Wallenberg learns
everything the men say in our rooms.

731
01:42:10,142 --> 01:42:12,804
I want to clean up my place, Margherita.

732
01:42:14,279 --> 01:42:19,114
I want it back the way it was,
as clean as it was, at any cost! Clean!

733
01:44:15,934 --> 01:44:17,925
I'll leave, piss, and be back!

734
01:44:24,610 --> 01:44:25,508
Kitty.

735
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:38,952
He'll end up a bit dead in the bathroom,
but he has forgiven the whole thing.

736
01:44:39,558 --> 01:44:41,219
I don't remember the rest.

737
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:47,224
Kitty, are you here
to make eyes at me again?

738
01:44:49,635 --> 01:44:53,969
I've known many men in my life,
but none as irresistible as you.

739
01:44:54,806 --> 01:44:56,296
Why do you resist me then?

740
01:44:59,811 --> 01:45:01,301
Well? What's going on?

741
01:45:01,413 --> 01:45:06,646
Transforming this antique nightclub
into a Spa of the ancient Rome?

742
01:45:07,185 --> 01:45:08,812
Kitty, get a sheet for yourself.

743
01:45:11,423 --> 01:45:14,654
We have to talk, if you decide
not to be a clown for a moment.

744
01:45:14,926 --> 01:45:16,655
As you wish. Tell me, tell me.

745
01:45:20,332 --> 01:45:22,857
I found out why Wallenberg made me
change my location.

746
01:45:22,968 --> 01:45:26,870
They're spying on us.
The girls are SS agents.

747
01:45:28,006 --> 01:45:32,670
Everyday they report all the silly things
our guys squirt out while fucking.

748
01:45:33,645 --> 01:45:37,672
The girls are from the SS?
Fuck me...!

749
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:41,142
I've known whores, but women like...
forgive me, Margherita.

750
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:46,015
That's not all.
The rooms are full of microphones.

751
01:45:47,125 --> 01:45:48,956
No, not the bathrooms!

752
01:45:50,362 --> 01:45:55,197
Of course, the noise of the shower
prevents them from listening.

753
01:45:55,400 --> 01:46:00,702
Don't think the Nazis are so democratic
they let people piss in peace!

754
01:46:00,806 --> 01:46:01,795
By the way...

755
01:46:08,213 --> 01:46:09,703
We need your help.

756
01:46:11,116 --> 01:46:12,105
To do what?

757
01:46:12,317 --> 01:46:13,716
To destroy him.

758
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:21,725
It's a bit unusual conspiring
in a bathroom, even for an Italian.

759
01:46:21,893 --> 01:46:24,726
However, it seems right that
the shit ends up in the toilet.

760
01:46:27,065 --> 01:46:30,228
Hurray, hurray, Paris!

761
01:46:30,869 --> 01:46:35,135
It's ours! Hurray!

762
01:46:41,747 --> 01:46:48,209
A toast to the German soldiers
marching under the Arch of Triumph!

763
01:46:48,353 --> 01:46:50,685
Heil Hitler!

764
01:46:50,789 --> 01:46:52,757
Heil Hitler!

765
01:46:56,561 --> 01:46:59,359
One more time!
Sieg Heil!

766
01:47:00,766 --> 01:47:01,926
Heil Hitler!

767
01:47:17,182 --> 01:47:18,911
- Long live France!
- Louder!

768
01:47:20,085 --> 01:47:21,985
- Long live France!
- One more time!

769
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,280
Long live France!

770
01:47:29,795 --> 01:47:31,126
Heil Hitler!

771
01:49:44,429 --> 01:49:46,522
Hello? What happened to you?
Where are you?

772
01:49:46,631 --> 01:49:50,931
In Paris, darling.
I tried to call you earlier.

773
01:49:51,102 --> 01:49:53,935
You know that we Italians are
at war now, too.

774
01:49:54,372 --> 01:49:57,830
Yes, just in time before
the inevitable triumph.

775
01:49:58,677 --> 01:50:03,478
The government decided I am the best
war correspondent and I couldn't refuse.

776
01:50:03,615 --> 01:50:05,981
What about me?
Did you forget about me?

777
01:50:06,151 --> 01:50:12,886
No. Nobody forgets your kisses.
Act as if I'm right there with you.

778
01:50:12,991 --> 01:50:17,155
Yes, of course, but it doesn't help.
I miss you too much! Thank you anyway.

779
01:50:17,295 --> 01:50:22,358
No, darling, thank you for what?
I beg you, no, Kitty, a duty-bound call.

780
01:50:22,534 --> 01:50:25,230
Listen, do you remember last time
in Margherita's bathroom?

781
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:28,962
I left the shower on,
and now it's filling up the whole room.

782
01:50:29,074 --> 01:50:32,669
Go to Margherita's bathroom,
and turn off the shower, understood?

783
01:50:32,811 --> 01:50:34,836
Go there immediately.
Be there at ten o'clock on the dot!

784
01:50:34,946 --> 01:50:37,574
At ten, you got it, Kitty?
Bye, Kitty.

785
01:50:37,749 --> 01:50:38,477
A kiss.

786
01:50:56,868 --> 01:51:00,861
I beg you pardon.
Is there something wrong?

787
01:51:02,173 --> 01:51:04,164
I'm fine, thank you.
I know everything.

788
01:51:05,443 --> 01:51:08,935
Dino told me to provide you with
a radio transmitter.

789
01:51:15,453 --> 01:51:16,249
Here it is!

790
01:51:19,024 --> 01:51:24,018
Turn in on, and I'll record every word
for you at a distance of 1 kilometer.

791
01:51:26,197 --> 01:51:30,031
If we want to fuck Wallenberg,
we'll use the same technique.

792
01:51:39,544 --> 01:51:41,034
I hardly see you anymore.

793
01:52:30,829 --> 01:52:34,265
Why aren't you saying anything?

794
01:53:34,058 --> 01:53:37,152
Talk to me. Please, talk to me.

795
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:21,866
Do you like it? Tell me.
Slave and master.

796
01:54:23,508 --> 01:54:26,841
Oh, God. I missed you so much.

797
01:55:44,322 --> 01:55:45,311
Drink it.

798
01:55:54,132 --> 01:55:58,296
I hate whores - paid lavatories.

799
01:55:58,970 --> 01:56:00,301
And what am I?

800
01:56:00,405 --> 01:56:04,307
Even if I don't do it for the money,
I'm still a whore.

801
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:07,300
You are my creature.

802
01:56:09,647 --> 01:56:13,981
I invented you -
you're my accomplice.

803
01:56:15,887 --> 01:56:18,321
Tell me anything you like - everything.

804
01:56:18,523 --> 01:56:20,821
Who knows when I'll be
able to see you again.

805
01:56:21,793 --> 01:56:22,782
Soon.

806
01:56:29,167 --> 01:56:34,002
No, wait. I want you to stay
as long as possible.

807
01:56:35,673 --> 01:56:36,435
And your wife?

808
01:56:36,974 --> 01:56:40,967
I sent her away.
She has the right to a day off.

809
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:44,070
She is still your wife.

810
01:56:44,949 --> 01:56:47,941
I'll be strong enough to
free myself from her soon.

811
01:56:50,655 --> 01:56:54,318
Kiss me. Please, kiss me.

812
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,352
Your illusions don't belong in here.

813
01:57:02,967 --> 01:57:04,457
They are not illusions.

814
01:57:14,946 --> 01:57:15,605
Listen!

815
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:19,643
My wife's grandfather was Jewish.

816
01:57:27,258 --> 01:57:30,386
It could be dangerous for you,
too, if they find out.

817
01:57:30,762 --> 01:57:35,131
Not anymore, once I have the power
of being respected - Hitler's power.

818
01:57:38,436 --> 01:57:39,425
Are you crazy?

819
01:57:41,506 --> 01:57:44,566
The bedroom secrets of all Germany
are in my hands.

820
01:57:46,744 --> 01:57:52,239
Those of Riebentrop, Göbels,
Keitel, Jodel...

821
01:57:53,418 --> 01:57:56,080
...even those of Heinrich Himmler.

822
01:57:57,255 --> 01:58:02,921
I know every single weakness
of each of them.

823
01:58:04,762 --> 01:58:06,423
The type of cocaine they use.

824
01:58:07,765 --> 01:58:10,427
Their impotence, their perversions...

825
01:58:10,802 --> 01:58:15,102
...the larcenies, the betrayals,
their rivals.

826
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,431
A variety of cowards!

827
01:58:18,443 --> 01:58:20,934
And what do your superiors
think of this?

828
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:24,112
Soon they won't have
any time left to think.

829
01:58:26,617 --> 01:58:29,609
It wasn't my idea at first,
I admit that.

830
01:58:30,855 --> 01:58:35,849
But I already know how to free myself
from all of them, as soon as I want to.

831
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:41,357
Maybe you're under the
illusion of power.

832
01:58:41,466 --> 01:58:42,125
No.

833
01:58:43,367 --> 01:58:45,699
It's true.
Every single word of mine is true.

834
01:58:46,237 --> 01:58:50,469
It's true! It's true!
Get this into your head for good!

835
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:53,403
I don't give a shit about
National Socialism...

836
01:58:53,611 --> 01:58:56,944
...just as no one gives a shit
about our leaders!

837
01:58:57,482 --> 01:59:00,144
All of them have just one goal: power!

838
01:59:00,485 --> 01:59:03,147
There are no ideals,
no belief system!

839
01:59:06,324 --> 01:59:09,487
You are the one who
has illusions, Margherita.

840
01:59:09,827 --> 01:59:14,992
You, and millions of Germans like you
who believed in us.

841
01:59:16,801 --> 01:59:20,293
It was a way to put
all of you at our feet.

842
01:59:22,607 --> 01:59:23,596
You...

843
01:59:25,977 --> 01:59:27,308
...a middle-class girl...

844
01:59:30,848 --> 01:59:33,840
...at the mercy of a pimp.

845
01:59:36,354 --> 01:59:40,518
To get you and all that you represent,
I've reduced you to my level.

846
01:59:43,694 --> 01:59:46,356
Like all the others.

847
01:59:47,532 --> 01:59:51,024
A band of gangsters.

848
01:59:54,772 --> 01:59:58,208
We turned everyone of you into
a criminal...

849
01:59:58,376 --> 02:00:02,039
...a murderer, a thief,
a corrupt accomplice...

850
02:00:03,047 --> 02:00:05,038
...and a slave!

851
02:00:06,217 --> 02:00:07,548
I believe you.

852
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:11,552
I don't want to talk anymore now.

853
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:13,879
Touch me here.

854
02:00:17,562 --> 02:00:21,896
Let me enjoy it.
Let me feel your power.

855
02:00:26,938 --> 02:00:27,927
Whore!

856
02:00:30,474 --> 02:00:35,434
I will appoint a whore as
the first lady of the Third Reich.

857
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,569
You pimp!

858
02:00:40,585 --> 02:00:44,419
A whore and a pimp who
salute each other in public:

859
02:00:44,755 --> 02:00:45,915
Heil...

860
02:00:47,258 --> 02:00:48,247
...Hitler!

861
02:00:59,103 --> 02:01:01,765
Nobody knows anything
about the two of us here.

862
02:01:04,141 --> 02:01:05,130
Only I do.

863
02:01:06,344 --> 02:01:11,782
A pimp, and you - a whore.

864
02:01:25,262 --> 02:01:26,422
A whore...

865
02:01:33,704 --> 02:01:35,171
...and a pimp.

866
02:01:54,892 --> 02:01:59,090
What's the matter, doll? Are you
starting to have enough of all of this?

867
02:01:59,263 --> 02:02:03,222
I'd like to see you in my shoes, with
legs spread from the morning to night.

868
02:02:03,334 --> 02:02:04,995
I can't deal with it anymore.

869
02:02:05,202 --> 02:02:06,499
Why don't you get out of it?

870
02:02:06,604 --> 02:02:08,231
I would, if I could.

871
02:02:10,274 --> 02:02:14,438
You are a gentleman.
Why won't you take me to America?

872
02:02:14,545 --> 02:02:15,477
Why don't you?

873
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:18,275
Of course. You have to put
something on, though.

874
02:02:18,382 --> 02:02:19,872
I'll get my stuff, and we'll leave.

875
02:02:20,451 --> 02:02:23,943
Listen - listen.

876
02:02:30,494 --> 02:02:32,655
Hurry up!
Roosevelt is waiting for us.

877
02:02:53,784 --> 02:02:54,512
Cliff?!

878
02:02:54,618 --> 02:02:55,778
I'll be right there.

879
02:03:46,771 --> 02:03:48,102
Filthy coward!

880
02:04:12,096 --> 02:04:14,564
Commander Wallenberg is
not in his office!

881
02:04:17,868 --> 02:04:20,200
I didn't come here to talk with him.

882
02:04:21,205 --> 02:04:23,400
I'm here to accuse him of betrayal.

883
02:04:25,109 --> 02:04:29,375
Wallenberg...
Do you realize what you are saying?

884
02:04:29,647 --> 02:04:30,545
Of course.

885
02:04:31,448 --> 02:04:34,906
I am a National Socialist, and I know
that traitors are to be squashed...

886
02:04:35,019 --> 02:04:37,579
...without any pity,
regardless of who they are.

887
02:04:38,489 --> 02:04:40,650
Do you have some evidence
you can show me?

888
02:04:43,327 --> 02:04:44,817
This is my report.

889
02:04:45,362 --> 02:04:48,195
You will recognize Wallenberg's
voice on this record.

890
02:04:57,942 --> 02:04:59,773
How did you find out about this?

891
02:05:00,778 --> 02:05:01,870
I am his lover.

892
02:05:04,548 --> 02:05:07,847
We'll take action, and
we'll listen to this.

893
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:11,381
You have to listen to it
and take action immediately.

894
02:05:11,488 --> 02:05:14,480
My statement is professionally
bound, it's official.

895
02:05:17,027 --> 02:05:20,519
If you don't think you can do it,
just let me know.

896
02:05:20,631 --> 02:05:22,963
I'll go directly to the national leader,
Himmler.

897
02:05:23,067 --> 02:05:25,763
I will take care of it immediately!
Don't worry, comrade!

898
02:05:32,543 --> 02:05:33,805
- Heil!
- Hitler!

899
02:05:41,819 --> 02:05:42,717
Come on in.

900
02:05:45,389 --> 02:05:48,381
I have been informed there will be
an urgent and secret meeting...

901
02:05:48,492 --> 02:05:49,891
...ordered by the Fuehrer.

902
02:06:07,878 --> 02:06:12,406
Look!
My wife's grandfather was Jewish.

903
02:06:16,453 --> 02:06:19,445
It could be dangerous for you, too,
if they find out.

904
02:06:19,723 --> 02:06:24,057
Not anymore, once I have the power
of being respected - Hitler's power.

905
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:28,320
Are you crazy?

906
02:06:30,434 --> 02:06:33,426
The bedroom secrets of all Germany
are in my hands.

907
02:06:35,739 --> 02:06:40,506
Those of Riebentrop, Göbels,
Keitel, Jodel...

908
02:06:42,112 --> 02:06:44,979
...even those of Heinrich Himmler.

909
02:06:46,450 --> 02:06:51,217
I know every single
weakness of each of them.

910
02:06:53,958 --> 02:06:55,448
The type of cocaine they use.

911
02:06:56,961 --> 02:07:02,297
Their impotence, their perversions,
the larcenies, the betrayals...

912
02:07:02,633 --> 02:07:04,123
...their rivals.

913
02:07:04,635 --> 02:07:06,466
A variety of cowards!

914
02:07:07,705 --> 02:07:09,969
What do your superiors think of this?

915
02:07:10,474 --> 02:07:13,466
Soon they won't have
any time anymore to think.

916
02:07:14,878 --> 02:07:15,867
Heil Hitler!

917
02:07:16,146 --> 02:07:18,808
It wasn't my idea at first,
I admit that.

918
02:07:20,084 --> 02:07:22,985
But I already know how to
free myself from all of them...

919
02:07:23,787 --> 02:07:25,311
...as soon as I want to.

920
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:28,481
Maybe you are under the
illusion of power.

921
02:07:28,726 --> 02:07:29,454
No.

922
02:07:30,561 --> 02:07:33,223
It's true.
Every single word of mine is true.

923
02:07:33,564 --> 02:07:37,830
It's true! It's true!
Get this into your head for good!

924
02:07:38,002 --> 02:07:40,664
I don't give a shit about
National Socialism...

925
02:07:40,871 --> 02:07:43,669
...just as no one gives a shit
about our leaders!

926
02:07:45,009 --> 02:07:47,671
All of them have just one goal: power!

927
02:07:48,178 --> 02:07:50,840
There are no ideals,
no belief system!

928
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:56,513
You are the one who
has illusions, Margherita.

929
02:07:56,854 --> 02:08:02,190
You, and millions of Germans like you
who believed in us.

930
02:08:03,827 --> 02:08:07,160
It was a way to put all of you at our feet.

931
02:08:07,798 --> 02:08:11,029
You - a middle-class girl...

932
02:08:13,103 --> 02:08:16,038
...at the mercy of a pimp.

933
02:08:18,642 --> 02:08:22,703
To get you and all that you represent,
I have reduced you to my level.

934
02:08:25,916 --> 02:08:33,220
Like all the others, a band of gangsters.

935
02:08:37,061 --> 02:08:40,394
We turned everyone of you
into a criminal...

936
02:08:40,664 --> 02:08:44,430
...a murderer, a thief,
a corrupt accomplice...

937
02:08:45,235 --> 02:08:47,396
...and a slave!

938
02:08:51,308 --> 02:08:55,768
I believe you.
I don't want to talk anymore now.

939
02:08:57,481 --> 02:08:58,470
Touch me here.

940
02:09:02,086 --> 02:09:03,451
Let me enjoy it.

941
02:09:04,655 --> 02:09:06,350
Let me feel your power.

942
02:09:11,895 --> 02:09:12,884
Whore!

943
02:09:16,433 --> 02:09:20,096
I will appoint a whore
as the first lady of the Third Reich.

944
02:09:20,304 --> 02:09:21,293
You pimp!

945
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:26,935
A whore and a pimp who
salute each other in public.

946
02:09:27,444 --> 02:09:29,605
Heil Hitler!
