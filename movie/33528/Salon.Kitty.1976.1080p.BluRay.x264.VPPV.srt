1
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,168
It's on, Wallenberg.

2
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,211
At last.

3
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,963
When?

4
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,467
A question of days.

5
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,012
A blitzkrieg!
And we're going to win!

6
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,975
The FLihrer was definite
as to how long it will last.

7
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,393
Guess.

8
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,692
A year? Six months?

9
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,278
Two months at most.

10
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,822
We'll scarcely have time to enjoy it.

11
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,536
We'll enjoy the postwar periods,
Herr Obergruppenfijhrer.

12
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,375
Gentlemen, to the war.

13
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,419
<i>To Germany and the Fuhrer.</i>

14
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,046
<i>S/eg hell.</i>

15
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,404
Wallenberg.

16
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,161
I'll need about 2O girls.

17
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,038
I know this is an easy task for you...

18
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,751
but this time, they must not only
be beautiful but intelligent...

19
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,921
and, above all,
good National Socialists.

20
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,923
<i>Go through Germany
with a fine-tooth comb.</i>

21
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,384
<i>Every city, every region.</i>

22
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>Inspect farms,
factories and universities alike.</i>

23
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,976
<i>From the bourgeois to the working class,
from housewives to office employees...</i>

24
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,854
<i>be they virgins or married,
inspect them thoroughly.</i>

25
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:58,567
<i>But mainly, Prefect, base your selection
upon their political faith.</i>

26
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:45,488
These three cadavers are clear proof
that our racial theories...

27
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,783
which are a very important part
of our Nazi ideology...

28
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:53,121
are based on
rigorously proven scientific fact.

29
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,920
The vices and corruption
of an inferior race...

30
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,173
are transmitted
from generation to generation...

31
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,216
by the chromosomes.

32
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,974
The pigmentation
of this black man, for example...

33
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,437
bears a direct relationship
to the bestiality of his race...

34
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,732
and the impossibility
of civilizing it.

35
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,069
He died in a physical stupor...

36
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,071
after a gunfight with the police.

37
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,656
Remove him.

38
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,331
This prostitute, on the contrary-

39
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:43,129
this prostitute, who died sitting up
while attempting an abortion...

40
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,382
is of pure Aryan stock...

41
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,885
and in spite of the vices of her profession...

42
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,137
and the corruption of her life...

43
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,724
this cadaver preserves, even in death...

44
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,396
all the typical characteristics
of a superior race.

45
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,356
Any questions?

46
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,443
<i>Professor, is it true Jesus Christ
was the son of a Roman prostitute...</i>

47
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,529
<i>and a German mercenary?</i>

48
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,114
Without a doubt.

49
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:15,453
There is not the slightest trace
ofjewish characteristics in Jesus Christ.

50
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,832
He was blonde, he had blue eyes...

51
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,252
typical signs of his Germanic origin.

52
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,506
Can you tell me
who was the first man in the world...

53
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,343
to recognize this fact
and make it known to humanity?

54
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,097
Yes, sir.
Our Fijhrer, Adolf Hitler.

55
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:39,788
He promised he'd free us from Communists
and labor unions in six months...

56
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,457
and, by God, he kept his promise.

57
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,711
Today, our racial laws
are the most socially advanced of all...

58
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,422
far more than the Fascist code in Italy.

59
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,883
It's so Italian!

60
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,844
I admire the Italians, Mother.

61
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,556
And so do I, darling.
They're more Mediterranean.

62
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,978
But they're very nice.

63
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,525
A little too exotic for my taste.
Too colorful.

64
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,194
Our party also suffers
from a certain lack of style.

65
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,489
All those brown shirts.
it's such a common color!

66
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,950
And his manners, my dear.

67
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,995
Have you noticed how he drinks his tea,
with his little finger raised?

68
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,000
You forget, Mrs. Henckel...

69
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,461
just as my mother
and father sometimes do...

70
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,340
that the National Socialists can't afford
to lose time studying etiquette.

71
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,428
They're too busy trying to rebuild
that order which you failed to defend...

72
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,390
since you were so busy
checking your little finger...

73
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,351
and choosing your stylish colors.

74
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:49,065
Don't you realize
you're a dead generation?

75
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,490
Good night.

76
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:05,039
National Socialism
has a great hold over the young.

77
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:10,378
Well, after all, that's what we were hoping
when we backed Hitler in '33, isn't it?

78
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,798
The most important thing
is to be on the winning side.

79
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,801
That's the side of history, my dear.

80
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,887
<i>- Fresh'.
- Prosk'.!</i>

81
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,816
From each of you,
the FLihrer asks this...

82
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,320
that you contribute
to the best of your ability...

83
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,741
to the war effort for the triumph
of National Socialism and Germany.

84
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,662
It would have been easier
to have chosen professionals...

85
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,542
but the FLihrer has greater confidence
in political faith than in technique.

86
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,421
Where there is goodwill,
technique can be learned quickly.

87
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,174
It's like killing.

88
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,594
The first time one can feel remorse...

89
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,054
vomit...

90
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,097
even suffer insomnia.

91
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,225
But by the third time,
one sleeps easily...

92
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,562
and from the fifth time on, one goes
to dinner with a healthy appetite.

93
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,148
Instead, it becomes exciting...

94
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,567
a thrill!

95
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,403
It will be like that for you too.

96
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,795
Comrades, remove your uniforms.

97
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:24,882
You are about to undergo group testing
with SS men of the Third Reich.

98
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,511
It will help you
to get rid of your inhibitions...

99
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,015
and will give naturalness
to your performance.

100
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,602
The most qualified will undergo
a second examination...

101
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,939
more detailed...

102
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,858
more specific.

103
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:53,536
The test has been tailor-made for you
by our psychosomatic center.

104
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,292
Your duty is to refuse nothing...

105
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,629
coitus, anal coitus...

106
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,341
masturbation and fellatio.

107
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,262
Ready, Herr Obergruppenfijhrer.

108
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,641
Enjoy yourselves, comrades.

109
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,977
Use your imagination.

110
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,564
This is also a way to serve the Fijhrer
and the Fatherland.

111
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,911
Ready!

112
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,416
Right face!

113
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,503
March!

114
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:47,757
Left, right, left!
Two, three, four!

115
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,511
Left, right, left!
Two, three, four!

116
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,725
Keep your distance!

117
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,484
Ready!

118
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,236
Halt!

119
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,446
Right face!

120
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,783
Stand straight!

121
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,974
Group 1, men.

122
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,561
Group 2, women.

123
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,815
Group 3, men.

124
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,819
Group 4, women.

125
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,948
Group 5, men.

126
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,785
Group 6, women.

127
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,664
Group 7, men.

128
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,042
Group 8, women.

129
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,254
Group 9, men.

130
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,549
Group 10, women.

131
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,783
Marika from LLibeck.

132
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,618
Perfect.

133
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,163
Splendid capacity for adaptation.

134
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,502
Olga from Hamburg.

135
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,697
No.

136
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,537
Martha from Danzig.

137
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,861
Rejected.

138
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,034
Margherita from Leipzig.

139
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,741
Approved.

140
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,953
Lela from Diisseldorf.

141
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,670
- What is he?
<i>'</i> A gypsy-

142
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,182
Weak. Mediocre.

143
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,893
No sense of race.

144
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,394
- Are you sure she's Aryan?
- Yes.

145
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,146
How embarrassing.

146
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,773
Susan from Berlin.

147
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,010
Courageous, determined...

148
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,140
fearless in combat,
steadfast faith in National Socialism.

149
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,684
Approved.

150
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,897
- Are there any more?
- That's everyone, Herr Untergruppenfiihrer.

151
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,609
I wanted to ask, what about the rejects?

152
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,862
The girls will be sent to the disciplinary
and educational sections.

153
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,447
The men-

154
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,247
Well, my dear Rauss...

155
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,668
we shouldn't keep mouths
around that can talk.

156
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,964
I thought they still might be
of some use in the labor camps...

157
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,258
or for Dr. Schwab's experiments.

158
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,928
You have one failing, Rauss.

159
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,808
You always want to prove that
your ideas are better than everyone else's.

160
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,894
I repeat, do exactly as I said!

161
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:10,134
Where do you think you're going?
They're all the same.

162
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,342
What frightens you more:
what you see, or what you don't?

163
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,177
Nothing frightens me.

164
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,390
The paintings hung here were...

165
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,436
degenerate art.

166
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,522
Expressionists.

167
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,148
French stuff.

168
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,151
Jewish culture.

169
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,248
No, thank you.
I'd rather have tea.

170
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,458
Tea?

171
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,630
The decadent habits
of the upper middle class.

172
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,549
No, on the contrary.

173
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,093
The bourgeois drink a lot.

174
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,720
I don't drink, like our Fijhrer.

175
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,975
Your damned bourgeois pride.

176
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,227
You haven't changed.

177
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,147
You're the same
as when you were born.

178
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,025
I believe in National Socialism.

179
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,118
Believing is not enough.

180
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:47,708
To be a real National Socialist,
you have to disown yourself, your origins.

181
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,253
You must compromise yourself completely.

182
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,715
You must negate yourself to be...

183
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,595
reborn.

184
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,440
You may go.

185
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,822
Good-bye. It was nice meeting you.

186
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,286
How can I negate myself?

187
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,881
Humiliate yourself.

188
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,507
HOW?

189
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,188
Take off your panties!

190
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,986
quickly!

191
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,623
Pull up your skirt now.

192
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,751
Higher.

193
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,169
Higher!

194
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,715
Go over there.

195
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,887
On your knees.

196
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,182
On your knees!

197
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,856
On all fours, like a bitch,
and now come here.

198
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,404
Crawl.

199
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,283
Fast! Fast!

200
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,867
Faster!

201
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,123
Do you see? You're nothing.

202
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,670
Just a bitch...

203
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,008
a bitch at my command.

204
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,137
I like the way you fight back.

205
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,557
I like your dignity. I like your pride.

206
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,770
Share that with <i>me...</i>

207
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,401
and I will share...

208
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,571
m)! POWer...

209
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,907
with you.

210
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,291
Do I repulse you?

211
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,585
Kiss me. Kiss me!

212
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,798
Do something, for God's sake!
I'm not part of your world, am I?

213
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,383
Say it!

214
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,596
You're part of a more valuable world.

215
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:47,572
September 1, 1939
Declaration ofwar on Poland

216
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,238
To the war!

217
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,537
Max! Franz! Schatzie!

218
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,456
Champagne for everybody!

219
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,958
It's on the house!

220
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,212
Champagne and kisses
from Kitty for everyone!

221
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:50,844
And reduced rates for soldiers on leave!

222
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,356
For amputee soldiers too?

223
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,318
Oh, please.

224
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,822
But even now, the first few
war-wounded are appearing...

225
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,033
and even the first few dead.

226
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:17,037
Young, blond romantics, in their death throes
next to the carcasses of their horses...

227
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,789
next to the carcasses of their armed guards.

228
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,541
An heroic image, right, Cliff?

229
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,503
Dino, if there weren't any dead,
it wouldn't be a war.

230
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,214
Then Germany couldn't win
and rule the world...

231
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,884
and we wouldn't be here
drinking champagne and having fun!

232
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,511
Well said!

233
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,096
Cliff is much more amusing
than you, my dear Dino.

234
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,641
And more logical.

235
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,769
His America is farther
from Berlin than my Naples!

236
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,152
My friends!

237
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,614
Girls! Gentlemen!

238
00:33:56,117 --> 00:34:00,121
Play something happy, Wolfie,
immediately, or you're fired!

239
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,364
Madame.

240
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,285
Madame. Kitty.

241
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,246
Madame!

242
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,842
You're the usual party pooper.

243
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,345
Come and join us.
Today I'm rationing out champagne.

244
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,349
If my girls don't interest you,
surely the champagne will.

245
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:05,186
Sorry, Kitty, I can't.
I've got a thousand things to do.

246
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,356
- I'll send you a car.
- What should I put in it?

247
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,734
Girls or champagne?

248
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,694
Just you.

249
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:19,451
I appreciate the compliment, darling,
but I gave up house calls a long time ago.

250
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,453
If you come, I'd be delighted.

251
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,789
Otherwise, stay in your office
with your pretty ass glued to your chair.

252
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,833
Good-bye!

253
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,221
Rauss!

254
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,054
Gestapo.

255
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,766
Have you gone mad?

256
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,353
You have me brought here
like a criminal by two Gestapo agents.

257
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,272
And to tell me what?

258
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,400
You've got to intern my girls
because they are foreigners?

259
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,612
I have to close down?
The party needs my house?

260
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,907
I'm not responsible.

261
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,411
Who the hell is responsible, then?
Himmler? Von Ribbentrop?

262
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,163
They are all my clients,
except for Giiring.

263
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,584
Have they gone mad too?
<i>I'll</i> call them all right now!

264
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,335
<i>I'll</i> show you who Kitty is.

265
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,588
Does this seem like an appropriate day?

266
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,631
War hasjust broken out.

267
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,010
What the hell does war
have to do with my work?

268
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,013
Do you want us to put on chastity belts
because war has broken out?

269
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,098
Are my girls to join the Red Cross?

270
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,063
Wallenberg, haven't you learned anything
from the Roman Empire?

271
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,901
You must know how to laugh and sing
if you want to conquer the world.

272
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,321
Unless you want to close the brothel
to open a music school.

273
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,198
Thank you very much...

274
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:14,537
but for the greatness of Germany
our brave soldiers are musical enough.

275
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,834
Don't you think our brave soldiers...

276
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:26,507
would like to have
half an hour in bed to come...

277
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,843
before they go?

278
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,554
Naturally.

279
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,682
But remember, most of them are married.

280
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,644
Married! Wives are for nursing.

281
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,940
A soldier wants to shoot off his own gun,
not just the one the army issued him.

282
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,361
Sometimes I have the feeling
you don't understand these things at all.

283
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,406
Just because I'm not interested
in your whores?

284
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,033
But that's not the point.

285
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,745
There's nothing to be done.
Sorry, Kitty.

286
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,039
You have to close down.

287
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,837
You're a pain in the ass.
You can't ruin me like this.

288
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,839
At least give me another year.

289
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,508
Six months!

290
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,053
Not even one day.

291
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,723
I told you, the party needs that building.

292
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,698
But I could help you.

293
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:36,577
I could get you some German girls...

294
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,165
and assign you a villa
in the Grunewald.

295
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:45,211
Thank you, but Kitty has always been
in the center of Berlin...

296
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,922
and has always had international girls.

297
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,135
You're making a big mistake.

298
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,680
I could give you
skillful, beautiful girls.

299
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,515
Elegant, too.

300
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,434
The area is isolated...

301
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,604
quiet, discreet...

302
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,234
and very high-class.

303
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,820
I could even get you a good price on it.

304
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,117
- And if I refuse?
- I wouldn't advise it.

305
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,579
I wouldn't advise it at all.

306
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,622
You would lose more than your license.

307
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:35,553
You obviously don't know me very well,
Herr Untergruppenfijhrer.

308
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,557
If I have to, <i>I'll</i> go to Hitler himself!

309
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,946
Still. Everybody still.

310
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,197
<i>I'll</i> miss this.

311
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,825
I'll miss this view.

312
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,628
<i>Schatzie...</i>

313
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,673
I don't give a damn
about changing the address.

314
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,219
Love smells
the same everywhere, thank God.

315
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,640
I'm not changing my profession.
I'm not changing you.

316
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,020
After all...

317
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,232
this isn't a house.

318
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,361
It's just a whorehouse.

319
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,990
Are you crying?

320
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,325
I don't know why!

321
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,246
I don't know.

322
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,584
I swear I don't know why.
I'm so stupid!

323
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,474
For heaven's sake, relax, girls!

324
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,310
We're not in the army.

325
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,437
Frankie, bring some drinks.

326
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,773
Something strong.
it's freezing cold in this place.

327
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,110
Well done, very good!

328
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,407
They can stand at attention rather well,
Wallenberg, but that's not enough here.

329
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,743
They look like amateurs.
Look at her.

330
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,705
She's all right for a Sunday picnic,
but not for someone who wants a good screw.

331
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,626
And her. Put a baby in her arms...

332
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,630
or a pair of knitting needles in her hand
and you've got the ideal housewife.

333
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,340
They have no fire!

334
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,968
She looks constipated.
She even makes me feel uncomfortable.

335
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,262
Imagine the poor guy
who comes to fuck her.

336
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,932
She was made for a parlor, not a brothel.

337
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:30,394
We need soft, warm girls, always ready...

338
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,814
able to maintain a smile
in any situation, my dear.

339
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,108
Technically, they are perfect.

340
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,403
I hope they don't salute the clients
when they come in.

341
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,906
With my own girls, I felt so easy.

342
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:46,077
I knew they could give
a dying man a hard-on.

343
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,665
All right, loosen them up.

344
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,417
After all, it's your profession, not mine.

345
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,587
They say you used to be phenomenal.

346
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,881
Teach them to be like you.

347
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,942
No! They are all beautiful, perfect!

348
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,194
Too damned perfect. They are boring.

349
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:24,407
They seem mass-produced, like the postcards
the soldiers send home to mama.

350
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,534
I need specialists...

351
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,412
girls able to satisfy any request...

352
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,038
the strangest desires...

353
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,292
the most complex perversions.

354
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,047
The clients of Salon Kitty have imagination.

355
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,426
If someone doesn't prove up to it,
let me know.

356
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,178
<i>I'll</i> answer for all of them.

357
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:59,817
Who would have guessed?
The two of us, educators.

358
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,246
Bravo.

359
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,084
Perfect.

360
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,587
So, Wallenberg,
this is now your battle station.

361
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,175
Work at your leisure.

362
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,427
And meticulously.

363
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,852
I want to check the girls' reports personally
and compare them with the recordings.

364
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,438
It's good to trust,
but better not to.

365
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,902
Carry out my orders to the letter,
as you're quite capable of doing.

366
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,446
And have fun, Wallenberg!

367
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,037
<i>- And what's your name?
- Susan, Herr General.</i>

368
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,623
<i>Why do you look at me like that?</i>

369
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,794
You look at me
as if we'd known each other for years.

370
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,131
All of Germany knows you,
Herr General.

371
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,843
You're the conqueror
and destroyer of Poland.

372
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,221
Conquer and destroy
my body as well, Herr General!

373
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,148
Let's leave Poland out of this.

374
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:59,653
War is a sacred thing
and it's too big to fit in this room.

375
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:05,159
<i>- Put on my boots.
-jawohl, Herr General.</i>

376
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,788
- <i>Can you</i> sing?
<i>-ja wohl, Herr General.</i>

377
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,166
Then sing and march!

378
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,388
Okay, Herr General?

379
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,604
Take off my pants!

380
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,356
<i>-/aw0h/, Herr General.'</i>
- <i>Don't call me</i> Herr <i>General!</i>

381
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,859
Call me... Greta.

382
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,418
<i>Do you like it? You feel it?</i>

383
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,046
<i>It burns, doesn't it?
Tell me you like it.</i>

384
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,507
<i>Tell me how it burns.</i>

385
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,425
<i>You're splitting open.</i>

386
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,344
<i>Take it!</i>

387
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,430
Yes, take it!
Become a comrade of the Axis.

388
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,140
An official of the <i>Duce.</i>

389
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,226
Tell me you like it.

390
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,187
Tell me how it burns, how you're dying.

391
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,940
You're splitting open. Say it.

392
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:22,569
Tell me you're dying. Tell me.

393
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,072
You're splitting open.
You're hurting yourself.

394
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,657
Give it to me!

395
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,742
Give it to me!

396
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,202
- You're killing me!
- Say it!

397
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,704
- Say it.
- You're killing me!

398
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,999
- You're dying.
- I'm dying. Give it to me!

399
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,002
<i>Say it]</i>

400
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,254
<i>Say it]</i>

401
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,052
Yes! I like it!

402
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,303
More!

403
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,681
I'm the woman from Masada.

404
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,599
Yes!

405
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,768
More!

406
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,025
Later on!

407
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,197
I like it!

408
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,165
You'll see...

409
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,251
in a month or two...

410
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,421
whether I'm right
or I'm talking nonsense.

411
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,050
In exchange for military bases...

412
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,135
the English will give us pounds sterling.

413
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:14,932
In Oslo and Copenhagen...

414
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,267
we'll be speaking English...

415
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,019
my golden strumpet.

416
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,523
A lovely tongue, English...

417
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,362
a tongue for your cunt,
my lovely ass.

418
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,281
Rauss, type up the report.

419
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,575
Use the exact words.

420
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,121
Send the first copy
and the recording to the chancellery...

421
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,624
and a second copy
to ReichsfLihrer Himmler...

422
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,584
extremely urgent, top priority.

423
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,921
- Without checking it first?
- Rauss!

424
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,133
How many times do I have to tell you
not to be so zealous?

425
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:54,513
I take full responsibility
for this operation...

426
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,099
personally.

427
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,341
Well, frankly, I was skeptical.

428
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,594
Human material coming
from God knows where.

429
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,431
Girls who knew nothing.
I was sweating blood.

430
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,434
For a few days, I feared a catastrophe.

431
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,478
But now we're sold out every night!

432
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,022
I can tell from the champagne.

433
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,691
It's impossible to find it
anywhere else but here now.

434
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,860
You'll always find it here.
I know where to get it.

435
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:54,031
- Von Ribbentrop is a friend of mine.
- So he's the one who supplies your...

436
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,282
Have you been at the front?

437
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,164
You made love...

438
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,084
as if you hated me.

439
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,879
No, it's not true.

440
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,964
Do you still want it?

441
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,718
Always.

442
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,303
So do I.

443
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,722
Of course.

444
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,434
Of course, it's your job.

445
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,355
Too bad.

446
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,398
Too bad you don't know
what it means.

447
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,484
Why are you here?

448
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,696
On leave?

449
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,782
You don't want to talk?

450
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,952
I want to fuck.

451
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,539
But if you don't want to-

452
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,457
I want to.

453
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,547
That's not true.

454
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,176
Why do you say that?

455
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,766
It's not true.

456
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,022
But why should I care?
That's what you're here for, right?

457
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,818
Just spread your legs.

458
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,699
I'll do it with pleasure.

459
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,380
Not like that.

460
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,010
Without anger.

461
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,723
With tenderness.

462
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,355
Let yourself go.

463
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,124
<i>Margherita's report.</i>

464
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,295
<i>Hans Reiter.</i>

465
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:40,715
<i>Captain of the Luftwaffe.</i>

466
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,385
<i>On leave from the front.</i>

467
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,137
<i>He didn't want to talk.</i>

468
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:49,015
<i>He only wanted to make love.</i>

469
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,601
<i>He did it several times.</i>

470
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,112
You are beautiful.

471
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:48,867
Even if you are just a whore,
making love to you is beautiful. I like it.

472
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,498
I hate life...

473
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,127
but I have nothing against you.

474
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,131
Are you on leave to get a medal?

475
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,508
Yeah.

476
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,720
I'll wear it on my back.

477
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,605
Will you fight again?

478
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,110
Perhaps I'm not a good soldier.

479
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,988
When do you leave?

480
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:30,575
Soon. In 10 days.

481
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,913
An eternity for making love.

482
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,292
Yeah, an eternity which ends right away.

483
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,092
If only I could take you away with me...

484
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,303
to fuck you whenever I want.

485
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,018
It's so good with you.

486
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,815
You're exaggerating.

487
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,902
Do you mind?

488
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,532
But you shouldn't exaggerate.
it's not right.

489
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,453
Would you mind
if I fell in love with you?

490
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,956
Just a little.

491
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,793
Does that seem ridiculous to you?

492
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,799
Love is a word you can always say
when two people are in bed together.

493
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,219
Of course.

494
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:05,336
- Hurry! The shelter's this way!
- Where's the shelter?

495
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,507
This way! Come on!

496
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,010
To the shelter!

497
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,012
quickly!

498
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,931
-
<i>'</i> Hurry!

499
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,817
Congratulations.

500
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,911
Congratulations to me
for having found you.

501
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,918
A gift before going back to war.

502
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,058
I saw light coming from under the door.

503
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,186
- Aren't you afraid?
- The English will never bomb Berlin.

504
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,564
Marshal Gijring himself promised us.

505
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,983
That's no reason to get drunk naked.

506
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,027
- Have a drink with us?
- With pleasure.

507
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,863
- Today is an important anniversary.
- What of?

508
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:58,366
Margherita and I met
exactly one week ago.

509
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:01,703
Many happy returns.
To you too, Margherita.

510
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,219
I don't like anniversaries.

511
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,514
I only like drinking
champagne with him.

512
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,975
Maybe not even with him.

513
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,728
I just like the champagne.

514
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:31,274
Too many good wishes bring bad luck.

515
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,312
Why, Hans?

516
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,232
What did I do?

517
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:07,578
<i>Train departing for Grunewald
from Platform 1.</i>

518
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,457
<i>Train departing for Grunewald
from Platform 1.</i>

519
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,835
Come on! Hurry!

520
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:27,432
<i>Next train for Grunewald departs
in 20 minutes from Platform 1.</i>

521
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,945
Left, left, left, two, three, four.

522
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:43,489
Man, you are not doing it right.

523
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:56,586
BLACK OUT

524
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,994
Why, Hans? Why?

525
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,179
From Warsaw to Leopoli...

526
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,681
gutted houses, burnt fields...

527
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,601
dead horses rotting in the sun...

528
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,605
and men, women, children,
piles of corpses.

529
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:01,108
Silent, deformed bodies,
bloated and rotting.

530
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,152
We massacred everyone.

531
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,531
I, too, have gunned down
defenseless citizens in a nosedive.

532
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,908
People screaming, their arms in the air.

533
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,036
I was born for this.

534
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,751
I thought my destiny was
to build houses to live and love in.

535
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,295
Instead, I've become...

536
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,840
the architect of a cemetery.

537
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,221
Margherita.

538
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,900
MEN

539
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,292
Love me, Hans.

540
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,627
Here, right now.

541
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,130
Are you starting to understand
what your despair means?

542
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,301
It's our last day. Stop talking.

543
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,100
I'm tired of slaughtering human beings.

544
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,771
But you're a soldier.
it's your duty to fight.

545
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:06,400
I know. Until yesterday,
I accepted that without discussion.

546
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,653
But now I've made up my mind.

547
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,824
I'm going to fight against Hitler...

548
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,327
against his madness...

549
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,331
against the violence
which is corrupting us all.

550
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,917
<i>Captain Hans Reiter came again today.</i>

551
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,502
What will you do?

552
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,550
When I get back to my base,
I'm defecting with my plane.

553
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,678
That's treason!

554
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,932
<i>He barely spoke,
only fragments of thoughts.</i>

555
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:41,185
<i>He's introverted, but sincere and honest.</i>

556
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:44,563
<i>He seems untroubled
in his National Socialist faith.</i>

557
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:54,699
Margherita, man belongs to humanity...

558
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:59,078
not to a nation
or a race or to a religion.

559
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,711
My conscience is clear.

560
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:09,088
<i>He just wanted to make love...</i>

561
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:13,884
<i>which is only right for a soldier
preparing to return to battle.</i>

562
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:17,304
<i>Margherita, man belongs to humanity...</i>

563
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:22,143
<i>not to a nation
or a race or to a religion.</i>

564
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,145
<i>My conscience is clear.</i>

565
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:28,899
In her report, the girl
has surely given the officer's name.

566
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,068
<i>Jawohl, Herr UntergruppenfLihrer.</i>

567
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,571
<i>Hauptmann Hans Rater.</i>

568
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,080
Precise and faithful.

569
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,958
He is returning to his base today.

570
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,755
Take care of him.

571
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,590
Right away.

572
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:59,430
<i>Jawohl, Herr UntergruppenfLihrer.</i>

573
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,933
Hauptmann Hans Reiter.
You fell in love with him.

574
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,518
No.

575
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,021
Drink it.

576
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,775
I'm sure you've also learned
to love champagne by now.

577
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,235
You saw him every day?

578
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,404
He was the one who asked for me.

579
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:18,282
And you?

580
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,285
You just spread your legs, that's it?

581
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,123
I told you to come in
only if I called you.

582
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,710
- Get out.
- Good-bye, miss.

583
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:32,088
I am Herta Wallenberg.

584
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,925
I married her a longtime ago.

585
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,803
I must say she's an excellent wife.

586
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,138
Discreet and faithful.

587
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,975
Get out.

588
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,150
No. Wait.

589
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:59,865
Pretend she is Hans Reiter.

590
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,244
Show me what you did with him.

591
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,665
You didn't describe that in your reports.

592
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:11,335
What is it? ls your pride
still getting in your way?

593
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:30,975
StOp!

594
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,980
Get out!

595
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:41,610
I didn't think you'd get involved
with this sentimental nonsense.

596
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:45,364
- But I guess I overestimated you.
- Why? Who do you think I am?

597
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,867
What you are is something
your Hans will never understand.

598
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,745
- What can he give you?
- And you?

599
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,374
Look!

600
01:19:58,502 --> 01:19:59,503
Look.

601
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,214
Look.

602
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,637
Here. You see?

603
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:18,605
Look!

604
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:22,109
And anything that can be sold,
<i>I'll</i> buy it!

605
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,445
It will be mine!

606
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,030
Like you.

607
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,742
I want you, too...

608
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,119
in my private dream.

609
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:34,830
You want another ghost, like your wife.

610
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,376
It's my wish, but your duty.

611
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,466
You want me to lose my body,
my very being?

612
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,593
Would you rather stay as you are now...

613
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,054
with your pitiful love affair?

614
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,890
My aims are higher.

615
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,601
That's why I'm a National Socialist.

616
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,603
I have a goal: power.

617
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,190
And with you, it will be complete.

618
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,901
Compared with all of this...

619
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:07,112
what does your pilot's
ridiculous love count for?

620
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,156
It's not love.

621
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:16,747
Look.

622
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,376
I have one of his letters here.

623
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,555
I could destroy him.

624
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,153
<i>Heinsberg, the 10th.</i>

625
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:52,282
<i>My love, I just arrived an hour ago...</i>

626
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:55,077
<i>and already I miss you...</i>

627
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,829
<i>need you...</i>

628
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,622
<i>want you.</i>

629
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,170
It hasn't been censored.
No one else has read it.

630
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,464
Only you.

631
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:11,385
You see?
lfl want to, I can do anything.

632
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:14,388
- You understand?
- Yes.

633
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,849
I can barter feelings
as if they were things.

634
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,435
Isn't it fantastic?

635
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,437
Yes, it is.

636
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,897
It's amazing. Like magic.

637
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,442
Will, not magic.

638
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:31,780
And that's how it is with you.
You're mine, because I want you.

639
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,116
Now you belong to me.

640
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,910
You're mine now.

641
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,662
My PFOtégé.

642
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:43,584
My accomplice. Say it.

643
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,336
I want you to say
you're my accomplice.

644
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,088
Say it.

645
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,549
Yes.

646
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,636
Say it.

647
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,348
You're mine.

648
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,311
<i>...miss you, need you, want you.</i>

649
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:07,941
<i>...miss you, need you, want you.</i>

650
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:11,778
<i>...miss you, need you, want-</i>

651
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,611
- The lonely butterfly.
- I don't find this clowning funny.

652
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:56,031
You're special.
That's why the neurotics like you.

653
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,951
If you know how,
you can get rich in no time.

654
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,245
- All you think about is money.
- Of course, dear.

655
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,664
What else can you think about
in this profession?

656
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,791
And when you've made enough, you quit.

657
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,002
You go back to living like
a respectable, decent person.

658
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,797
You think like a servant.

659
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,007
You have no ideals.

660
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,510
You're not a National Socialist.

661
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,349
My dear Susan.

662
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,601
First and foremost, I am a madam.

663
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:28,772
Just as you, despite your ideals, Hitler,
your husband and your daughter...

664
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:32,484
are first and foremost a whore.

665
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,821
I am not! I am not!

666
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,703
Stop it!

667
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,705
<i>No, no, don't!</i>

668
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,342
JESUS, Mary andjoseph!

669
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:02,889
Being a whore seems like
an easy, comfortable, luxurious life.

670
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:08,020
They all fall for it. Then they realize
it's not like that, but it's too late.

671
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:10,355
Darling Hilde.

672
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,031
Aren't you getting undressed?

673
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,125
<i>Do you like it like this?</i>

674
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,675
Go over there on the bed.

675
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,512
Get on the bed.

676
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,150
Turn off the light.

677
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,408
- What is it?
- Bread.

678
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,957
I had it made
at the finest bakery in Berlin.

679
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,334
Perfect, isn't it?

680
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,087
Put it between your legs.

681
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,047
Not inside, outside.

682
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,843
Now I'll attach it,
so it really seems like it's yours.

683
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,011
Caress it, come on.

684
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,264
Fondle it.

685
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:10,600
Good.

686
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,338
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuck! Sieg <i>hei/I</i>

687
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,758
<i>Fuck'. Heil Hitler!</i>

688
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,093
<i>Sieg heil! Fuck'.!</i>

689
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,512
What's wrong with you?

690
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,517
- Help me!
- Fuck! Sieg <i>he/I!</i>

691
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,145
Help!

692
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:59,876
The poor girl. It was a mistake.

693
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,878
I should have told you!

694
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:04,881
I should have refused to work this way!

695
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,093
Calm yourself.

696
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:12,472
I trust there will be
no further incidents of this sort.

697
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,767
If there are, call me immediately.
I'll take care of it personally.

698
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,352
As you did today?

699
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,230
As I did today.

700
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:33,368
What are you staring at?
Get out while you still can!

701
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,829
This is a lousy life!

702
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:40,000
A life full of shit, vomit,
sperm, piss, pigs and idiots!

703
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,751
Go away!

704
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:54,848
And you.

705
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,808
Especially you.

706
01:29:57,767 --> 01:30:02,188
Why do you let yourself
be humiliated by men this way?

707
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:07,319
You're so beautiful, so gentle.

708
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,863
Save yourself, Margherita. Save yourself.

709
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:13,366
Anything is better than this life.

710
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:17,370
Save yourself.

711
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:36,056
How did you manage
to hide it until now?

712
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:41,186
I bandaged myself tightly.
When I undressed, no one paid attention.

713
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:44,773
Until a few days ago,
it was possible, but now...

714
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,319
You should have
informed us immediately.

715
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:52,572
- Why didn't you?
- I want to have the baby.

716
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:55,951
- I've never heard anything so ridiculous.
- it's mine.

717
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,330
- And the father?
- it's mine.

718
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:06,336
Do you mean to say you'd consider
having a baby without proper state control?

719
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,255
Have you forgotten
that you are still an SS woman?

720
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:11,049
One of our auxiliaries?

721
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,427
It's mine.

722
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,815
Psychologically, this girl is finished...

723
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,693
as far as her mission's objectives
are concerned.

724
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,490
We can't keep a whore like her around.

725
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,617
She knows too much.

726
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:41,538
Doctor, the solution is up to you.

727
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:25,957
You're Margherita, right?

728
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,085
Hans Reiter's girl.

729
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:32,130
We were in the same squadron.
He told me about you.

730
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,215
Yes, I know him. He's been here.

731
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:40,346
Did you know he was in love with you?

732
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,975
These things happen.
Fortunately, he got over it quickly.

733
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,061
I don't think he did.

734
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,619
Too bad. A man should never
fall in love with a girl like me.

735
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:07,290
I'm a whore.

736
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,898
- Where is he now?
- Don't you know?

737
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,569
He was hanged a few days
after he returned to the base.

738
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:40,949
For defeatism and anti-patriotism.

739
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:45,328
There was an SS report from Berlin.

740
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,372
He was planning to desert.

741
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,458
He was going over
to the other side, the swine.

742
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,794
We thought he was a good comrade.

743
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,256
But he was just an asshole.

744
01:33:56,339 --> 01:34:00,093
With us he played the National Socialist,
and in private he considered us murderers.

745
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:01,761
He was a coward.

746
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:03,888
A traitor with no balls.

747
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:07,016
Fortunately, he gave himself away.

748
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:13,731
They hanged the son of a bitch
on a meat hook.

749
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:17,068
I got a kick out of seeing
that bastard hanging up there.

750
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,154
Like a stuck pig.

751
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:26,369
I even had the satisfaction
of spitting on his corpse.

752
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,958
<i>- That sounded like a gun!
- Margherita! Help!</i>

753
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:35,503
<i>Open up! What happened?</i>

754
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:38,548
<i>- Margherita!
- Open up! It's locked.</i>

755
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:18,713
Get me Wallenberg's office at once.

756
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,762
Wallenberg? it's Kitty.
There's been an incident here.

757
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:29,098
An officer killed himself
in the bathroom.

758
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:51,829
When are you planning
to go back to Berlin?

759
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:53,373
I don't know, Mama.

760
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:57,001
Darling, are you on sick leave?

761
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,505
Yes, let's say I am.

762
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:03,549
A nervous breakdown.

763
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:05,760
From working too much.

764
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:08,972
And do they approve?
What do they think about it?

765
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:12,058
They who?
What do you know about them?

766
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,143
You don't even know what I do.

767
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:18,690
You just know that one day I left home.

768
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,943
You never wondered
what kind of work or where.

769
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:23,945
You never permitted me-

770
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,948
I didn't permit you to register me
in the National Socialist Party either.

771
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,325
This grudge against your father
is childish.

772
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,286
I bear no grudges.

773
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,787
You despise us!

774
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,248
It's true.

775
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,583
I despise your hypocrisy...

776
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:39,877
your fear of facing the truth.

777
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:41,421
You hide in silence...

778
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:44,882
- under the cloak of law and order.
- Yes! And of tradition.

779
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:47,677
A fine tradition. Look at yourselves.

780
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,013
Two mummified insects.

781
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,098
Why should people like you be saved?

782
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:56,769
For the future of Germany, my dear,
our generation must preserve-

783
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:59,355
Preserve what? Your hide?

784
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:01,107
Your property?

785
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:06,070
With your eyes closed
so as not to see, not to think?

786
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:09,866
A few months ago,
you sang a very different song.

787
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:15,830
- It's for you, miss.
- Who is it?

788
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,875
Madam Kitty Kellermann!

789
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,920
- Kitty?
- Tell her I'm not at home.

790
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,757
No, wait. Show her to the veranda.

791
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,892
What kind of work do you do in Berlin?

792
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,810
Invent something, Father.

793
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:41,189
Whatever makes your conscience
sleep in peace.

794
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:47,570
<i>I understand you, darling.</i>

795
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,698
<i>If I were you,
I would have done the same thing.</i>

796
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:54,369
But I can't keep on covering for you.
Wallenberg wants you back.

797
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,873
So now you're pimping for Wallenberg.

798
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,211
I don't pimp for anybody...

799
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:06,130
especially not
for a politician like Wallenberg.

800
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:10,510
But don't forget that
a German officer was killed in your room.

801
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:14,138
It's both stupid and dangerous
to oppose a man like him.

802
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:16,974
Are you blackmailing me?
Well, I don't give a damn.

803
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,644
Go ahead and tell him.
Tell him it was me.

804
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,271
And that I killed that pig to avenge Hans.

805
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:26,484
You loved him that much?

806
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:34,283
You don't have to come back tomorrow,
or even the next day.

807
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:36,828
Relax a while.

808
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,956
Meanwhile,
I'll try to smooth things over.

809
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,667
There's nothing to smooth over.
I'm not going back.

810
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,920
And don't lie. it's no good.
Write the report yourself.

811
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:49,298
- Margherita is leaving Operation Kitty!
- What operation?

812
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,717
The one that gets
people hanged on meat hooks.

813
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:55,263
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The operation you run, Kitty.

814
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:58,516
Your den of spies
who drink champagne and fuck...

815
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:01,102
and report everything they hear
back to Wallenberg.

816
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:04,105
There's not a word of truth
in what you're saying.

817
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:07,525
Stop playacting, Kitty.
I'm not asking you tojustify yourself.

818
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,570
I don't give a fuck if you're
Wallenberg's accomplice. I am too!

819
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:11,946
Me?

820
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:14,866
Accomplice to an SS captain?

821
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:19,203
You've betrayed me.
Spy!Spy!

822
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:24,584
A spy in my house!
In my honest, clean, welcoming house!

823
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:27,503
I hate all of you!
The whole lot of you!

824
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:32,008
I never dirtied myself
with all that political shit.

825
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:42,685
People can do whatever they want there.

826
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,938
Sex is clean.

827
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:56,407
Now I understand everything.

828
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,494
You changed the house.
You changed the girls.

829
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,704
You thought you could change Kitty too.

830
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:05,791
But I'll show that bastard Wallenberg.
I'll destroy him like a worm.

831
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,253
I'll go to Himmler.
I'll go to Hitler.

832
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,548
And this time, I mean it.

833
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,807
Calm down, Kitty.

834
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:25,436
I thought you were in on it with them.

835
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,897
Me? Stupid girl.

836
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,650
How could you think such a thing?

837
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:33,152
Forgive me.

838
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:35,696
But, Kitty...

839
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:40,076
how could Wallenberg know
every single word Hans said in my room?

840
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,374
We were alone.

841
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,544
How could he know how Hans felt?

842
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:52,421
His decision to defect?

843
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:54,882
That's why they hanged him.

844
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:58,427
- It's you who hanged him on that hook.
- No.

845
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:04,433
No, I never wrote a single word
of what Hans told me in my report.

846
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:09,230
I didn't want to admit
that I loved him before.

847
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,274
But now I know.

848
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:13,609
And I also know what he meant...

849
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:18,114
when he told me,
“I'm tired of slaughtering human beings.”

850
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:21,242
He was sure that I, too...

851
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:23,953
would start to understand.

852
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:34,255
- Do you want to be on my side?
- No. On that side, never.

853
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:37,133
Don't you see I've changed?
I'm waking from a nightmare.

854
01:41:37,216 --> 01:41:40,803
You must help me.
Decide. You must wake up too.

855
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:47,893
I don't understand
anything anymore, not a thing.

856
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:53,024
Wasn't it you who said that
women understand each other better?

857
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:55,276
Let's try.

858
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:58,571
What do you want to do?

859
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,865
Go back to Berlin at once...

860
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:05,411
and try and find out how Wallenberg
knows everything the men say...

861
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:07,163
when they come up to our rooms.

862
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,876
I want to clean up my house...

863
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:14,420
whatever the cost.

864
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:17,632
I want it clean like it was before. Clean.

865
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,709
I go, I piss and I return.

866
01:44:23,132 --> 01:44:24,633
Kitty.

867
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:37,521
In the bathroom, Marat was slain,
but history did pardon him again.

868
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:39,899
I can't remember any more.

869
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:45,613
Kitty! Have you come to feast your eyes?

870
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:52,411
I have known many men in my life,
but no one as irresistible as you.

871
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:55,164
I know. But why do you resist me?

872
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,710
What's going on?

873
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:05,174
Are we turning this ancient, noble brothel
into a <i>ca/dar/um</i> of ancient Rome?

874
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,010
Get yourself a sheet too, Kitty.

875
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:13,349
We need to talk to you,
if you can stop clowning for a moment.

876
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:15,643
As you like. What's up?

877
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:21,398
I found out why Wallenberg
forced me to move here.

878
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:23,275
We are being spied on.

879
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:25,361
The girls are all SS agents.

880
01:45:26,612 --> 01:45:31,158
Every day they report all the nonsense
you men let slip while you're fucking.

881
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,245
The girls are all SS agents?

882
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,622
The sheer arrogance!

883
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:39,667
I know they're whores, but bitches too?
Sorry, Margherita.

884
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:44,672
That's not all.
The rooms are bugged.

885
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:47,550
Not the bathrooms.

886
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,511
Of course.

887
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:53,931
The sound of the water
would keep them from listening.

888
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:59,311
But don't think the Nazis are
democratic enough to let you piss in peace!

889
01:45:59,395 --> 01:46:01,438
Which reminds me.

890
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,904
We need your help.

891
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:12,700
- What for?
- To destroy him.

892
01:46:14,577 --> 01:46:20,332
Well, it's a bit unusual to conspire
in a bathroom, even for an Italian.

893
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:22,918
But it seems fitting
for shit to end up in the toilet.

894
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:30,885
Paris is ours!

895
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:42,438
I drink to the German soldiers...

896
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:46,775
who are marching
under the Arc de Triomphe!

897
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:56,619
Again!

898
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:58,996
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

899
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:18,432
<i>- Vive La France!
- Stronger'.!</i>

900
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:20,476
- <i>Vive L a France!</i>
- M <i>ore!</i>

901
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:22,978
<i>- V/ve La France!
- Finished!</i>

902
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:27,191
<i>Vive La France!</i>

903
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:33,030
- <i>Hei/ Hit/er!</i>
<i>- Sieg hell!</i>

904
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:40,204
<i>Et maintenant, mesdames,
mesdemoiselles et messieurs!</i>

905
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:43,040
<i>Le cancan!</i>

906
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:45,120
Hello. What happened?
Where are you?

907
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:47,873
<i>In Paris, darling.
Paris liberated by the Weimar.</i>

908
01:49:47,956 --> 01:49:49,416
<i>I tried to call you before.</i>

909
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,711
As you know,
we Italians are also at war now.

910
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:56,465
Yes,just in time
for the unfailing triumph.

911
01:49:57,216 --> 01:50:00,094
The big brass decided
I'm the best war correspondent.

912
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:02,054
<i>I couldn't refuse the honor.</i>

913
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:04,473
And what about me?
Have you forgotten about me?

914
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:08,602
No. Your kisses are unforgettable.

915
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,355
Pretend I'm still there with you.

916
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:14,566
<i>I do, but it's no good.
I miss you too much.</i>

917
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:17,611
<i>- Thanks anyway.
- But no, darling! Thanks for</i> what?

918
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:21,031
<i>Listen, I had to call you anyway.</i>

919
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,909
<i>Remember the last time
in Margherita's bathroom?</i>

920
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:27,412
<i>I forgot to turn off the shower.
The whole room will be flooded.</i>

921
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:31,166
<i>Go up to Margherita's bathroom
and turn off the shower. Got it?</i>

922
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,418
<i>But do it now. At 10:00 precisely.</i>

923
01:50:33,502 --> 01:50:36,088
<i>At 70:00, understood? Ciao.</i>

924
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,756
Kisses.

925
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,192
Excuse me.

926
01:50:58,026 --> 01:51:00,028
Aren't you feeling well?

927
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:03,157
I'm fine, thanks. I know everything.

928
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:07,494
Dino asked me to find you
a radio transmitter.

929
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,711
Here it is.

930
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:22,801
You turn it on, and I'll record
every word from up to halfa mile away.

931
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:29,057
If we want to screw Wallenberg,
we use his same technique.

932
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:40,110
I see you so rarely.

933
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:31,745
Why don't you say something?

934
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:33,872
Are you angry with me?

935
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:36,184
Speak to me.
Say something, please.

936
01:54:15,223 --> 01:54:18,477
You like that, don't you?

937
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,729
Slave and master.

938
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:25,650
God, how I've wanted you.

939
01:55:42,894 --> 01:55:44,563
Drink it.

940
01:55:52,737 --> 01:55:54,781
I despise whores.

941
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,950
They're public toilets.

942
01:55:57,617 --> 01:55:58,910
What am I then?

943
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:02,831
Even if I don't do it for money,
I'm still a whore.

944
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,418
You're my creation.

945
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:10,005
I invented you.

946
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:12,841
You're my accomplice.

947
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:16,928
Do anything you want to me, anything.

948
01:56:17,012 --> 01:56:19,347
Who knows when I'll see you again.

949
01:56:20,265 --> 01:56:21,808
Very soon.

950
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:29,649
Wait.

951
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:32,694
I want it to last as long as possible.

952
01:56:34,196 --> 01:56:36,698
- Your wife?
- I sent her away.

953
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:39,743
She's entitled to one day off.

954
01:56:41,036 --> 01:56:43,288
She's still your wife.

955
01:56:43,371 --> 01:56:46,583
Soon I'll be powerful enough
to free myself of her.

956
01:56:49,211 --> 01:56:52,881
Kiss me. Please kiss me.

957
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:57,260
There is no place for illusions here.

958
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,517
They're not illusions.

959
01:57:12,984 --> 01:57:14,069
Look!

960
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:18,114
My wife's grandfather was a Jew.

961
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:29,042
That could be dangerous for you too,
if they find out.

962
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:33,755
Not when I have the power I deserve,
the power of Himmler.

963
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:38,635
You're crazy.

964
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:43,598
I have in my hands
the bedroom secrets of all Germany...

965
01:57:45,267 --> 01:57:46,768
Ribbentrop...

966
01:57:47,519 --> 01:57:48,853
Goebbels...

967
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:51,189
KeiteLjodl...

968
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:55,026
and even Heinrich Himmler.

969
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:58,238
I know the weaknesses...

970
01:57:59,197 --> 01:58:01,908
of every single one of them.

971
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:05,161
The cocaine they take...

972
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:08,832
their impotence, their perversions...

973
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:12,002
their thieving, their betrayals...

974
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:14,004
their rivalries.

975
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:16,256
Social climbers and cowards.

976
01:58:17,048 --> 01:58:19,801
What do your superiors think about it?

977
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:22,971
Soon, they won't have time to think.

978
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:28,518
The original idea wasn't mine, I admit...

979
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:32,397
but I know how I can get rid of them all...

980
01:58:33,148 --> 01:58:35,317
whenever I wish.

981
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:41,323
- Maybe your power is an illusion.
- No.

982
01:58:41,906 --> 01:58:44,159
Every word is true.

983
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,620
It's true!

984
01:58:46,703 --> 01:58:49,164
Get that through your head!

985
01:58:49,247 --> 01:58:52,083
I don't give a damn
about National Socialism...

986
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:55,462
just as none of our leaders
give a damn!

987
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:58,882
They all have one goal: power!

988
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:01,718
There are no ideals.
There is no faith.

989
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:08,266
You are the one
with illusions, Margherita...

990
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:13,772
you and the millions of Germans
like you who believed in us.

991
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:19,235
It was a way to get you all
under our thumb.

992
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:22,197
You...

993
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,368
a bourgeois...

994
01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:33,041
at the mercy of a pimp.

995
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:39,339
To have you and what you stand for,
I brought you down to my level.

996
01:59:42,258 --> 01:59:45,387
Just like all the others.

997
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:50,225
Now you're servants
to a bunch of gangsters.

998
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:56,815
We made criminals out of all of you.

999
01:59:56,898 --> 02:00:00,860
Murderers, thieves,
corrupted accomplices...

1000
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:04,072
and slaves.

1001
02:00:04,906 --> 02:00:06,408
I believe you.

1002
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:10,870
I believe you,
but I don't want to talk now.

1003
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:13,081
Touch me here.

1004
02:00:16,084 --> 02:00:17,877
Give me pleasure.

1005
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:20,922
Let me feel your power.

1006
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:26,845
Whore.

1007
02:00:28,847 --> 02:00:33,977
I'll turn a whore into
one of the first ladies of the Third Reich.

1008
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,396
Pimp.

1009
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:43,194
A whore and a pimp
who salute each other in public.

1010
02:00:43,278 --> 02:00:47,240
<i>Heil... Hitler.</i>

1011
02:00:57,667 --> 02:01:01,045
No one knows anything
about the two of us here.

1012
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,007
<i>Only me...</i>

1013
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:08,136
a pimp, and you...

1014
02:01:09,137 --> 02:01:10,680
a whore.

1015
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:25,028
A whore.

1016
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,496
And a pimp-

1017
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:55,099
What's the matter, honey?

1018
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:57,769
Are you getting tired of all this?

1019
02:01:57,852 --> 02:02:01,648
I'd like to see you do it,
legs spread all day long.

1020
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:03,650
I can't take it anymore.

1021
02:02:03,733 --> 02:02:06,986
- Why don't you quit?
- I would if I could.

1022
02:02:08,822 --> 02:02:10,490
You're nice.

1023
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:13,868
Take me to America with you.
Would you?

1024
02:02:13,952 --> 02:02:16,663
Why not. But put some clothes on.

1025
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:19,541
- I'll get my things, and we'll go.
- Listen.

1026
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:23,294
Listen.

1027
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:31,678
Hurry up. Roosevelt's waiting for us.

1028
02:02:52,282 --> 02:02:54,576
- C/ifi'?
- Corning!

1029
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:44,375
She hanged herself.

1030
02:03:45,043 --> 02:03:47,295
Dirty coward.

1031
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:13,154
Untergruppenfijhrer Wallenberg
is not in the office!

1032
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:18,534
I haven't come to see him.

1033
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:21,955
I've come to charge him with treason.

1034
02:04:23,748 --> 02:04:25,249
Wallenberg?

1035
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:31,589
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- I do. I am a National Socialist.

1036
02:04:31,673 --> 02:04:36,135
I know that traitors must be crushed
without pity, no matter who they are.

1037
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:39,305
Do you have any proof?

1038
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:43,893
This is my report.

1039
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:46,688
You will recognize
Wallenberg's voice on this recording.

1040
02:04:56,572 --> 02:05:00,368
- How did you find out?
- I'm his mistress.

1041
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:05,415
We'll look into it.

1042
02:05:05,498 --> 02:05:07,083
We'll listen to it.

1043
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:09,919
You must listen to it
and take action immediately.

1044
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:12,922
My accusation is professional, official.

1045
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:19,137
If you don't think you can handle it,
just tell me so.

1046
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,472
I'll go directly to ReichsfLihrer Himmler.

1047
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:24,225
I'll take care of it immediately!
Don't worry, comrade!

1048
02:05:40,283 --> 02:05:41,784
Come in.

1049
02:05:43,911 --> 02:05:48,916
A report and a recording! Very urgent!
Top secret, Herr ObergruppenfLihrer!

1050
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:07,852
<i>Look!</i>

1051
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,272
<i>My wife's grandfather was a jew.</i>

1052
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:18,196
<i>That could be dangerous for you too,
if they find out.</i>

1053
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:21,324
<i>Not when I have the powerl deserve...</i>

1054
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:23,785
<i>the power of Himmler.</i>

1055
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:27,538
<i>You're crazy.</i>

1056
02:06:28,664 --> 02:06:31,959
<i>I have in my hands
the bedroom secrets of all Germany...</i>

1057
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,339
<i>Ribbentrop...</i>

1058
02:06:36,422 --> 02:06:37,673
<i>Goebbels...</i>

1059

<i>Keitel, jodl...</i>

1060
02:06:40,802 --> 02:06:43,638
<i>and even Heinrich Himmler.</i>

1061
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:47,391
<i>I know the weaknesses...</i>

1062
02:06:48,309 --> 02:06:51,020

1066
02:07:00,905 --> 02:07:03,116
<i>their rivalries.</i>

1067
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,535
<i>Social climbers and cowards.</i>

1068
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:09,038
<i>What do your superiors think about it?</i>

1069
02:07:09,122 --> 02:07:12,333
<i>Soon, they won't have time to think.</i>

1070
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,672
<i>The original idea wasn't mine, I admit...</i>

1071
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:21,467
<i>but I know how I can get rid of them all...</i>

1072
02:07:22,343 --> 02:07:24,428

1073
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:28,141
<i>- Maybe your power is an illusion.
