of meeting Charles a few times.

561
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:26,232
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

562
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,887
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

563

Yeah, but he also...

to take
our relationship slowly.

00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,940
[chuckles] Are you okay?
What happened?

647
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,987
[Astrid] Yeah. I'll live.

648
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,511
Uh, what are you reading?

649
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,384
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

650
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,125
- One of those.
-"One of those"?

651
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,735
What does that mean?

652
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,780
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

653
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,218
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

654
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,915
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

655
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:35,916
Yes.

656
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,831
Yeah, I...

657
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,182
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

658
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:42,749
Where have you been
all my life?

659
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:49,495
[Astrid] So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

660
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:50,844
[boy] My whole life.

661
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:52,541
I've never seen you
around before.

662
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,195
[Astrid] Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

663
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,675
for my grandpa's funeral.

664
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,504
Until my mom's janky fiance

665
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,984
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

666
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,377
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

667
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:06,338
[boy] Wow. That's different.

668
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:07,687
[Astrid] Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

669
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,167
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

670
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,170
Is your dad
in the picture or...

671
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,520
No.

672
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,262
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

673
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,047
Defender of hopeless causes.

674
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,354
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

675
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,877
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

676
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,706
But my mom grew up here.

677
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,360
That old house on the hill.

678
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,753
Wait. The Ghost House?

679
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,234
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

680
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,062
Unfortunately.

681
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,759
She's a legend.

682
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,848
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

683
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:40,763
You don't?

684
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,027
- No.
- Mmm-hmm.

685
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,681
I only believe in things
that I can see.

686
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,466
You know, science. Facts.

687
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,859
[cell phone buzzing, chiming]

688
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,470
[Jeremy] Oh.

689
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,472
- Yeah, it's gonna keep going.
- [chuckling]

690
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,952
Back to the insanity.

691
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,216
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

692
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,826
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

693
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,176
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

694
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:07,747
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

695
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:11,446
if you want a break
from the insanity.

696

[camera shutter clicks]

703
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,134
[lieutenant]
Witness confirmed our suspect

704
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,179
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

705
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,224
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

706
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:51,704
Hit me.

707
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:52,748
[lieutenant]
After she turned the owner

708
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,837
into a human pancake,

709
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,665
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

710
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,364
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

711
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,800
has her twisted heart set

712
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:04,456
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

713
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,066
She won't stop killing,

714
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,069
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

715
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:15,249
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

716
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:17,947
[footsteps approaching]

717
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,732
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

718
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:21,647
Thank you, Janet.

719
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,171
You keep me real.

720
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,390
[Lieutenant] Should we take
this Beetlejuice

721
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:26,739
into protective custody?

722
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,088
See if you can find him.

723
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,568
He's probably laying low.

724
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,787
Scared out of his mind.

725
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,665
[Beetlejuice]
A little higher, boys.

726
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,667
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

727
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:46,280
[Bob grunts]

Bob.

730
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,503
Like lookin' in a mirror.

731
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,158
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

732
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,943
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

733
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,120
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

734
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,382
[Bob groans]

735

[shouts] What?

742
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,108
- Why?
- [camera shutter clicks]

743
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,633
No! No! No!

744
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,330
Delia, what's wrong?

745
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:37,897
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

746
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,551
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

747
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,857
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

748
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,685
- Why?
- For the Collective.

749
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,774
We cannot sincerely celebrate

750
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,342
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

751
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,344
Not until we release the horror

752
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:51,954
that they inflicted upon us.

753
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,392
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

754
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,090
He bought this house
without telling me.

755
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,614
[rushing footsteps approaching]

756
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,138
Oh, my God!

757
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,923
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

758
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:05,533
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

759
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,405
[stutters] It was Delia.

760
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,928
Oh, Delia.

761
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:10,320
[exclaims] I'm good.

762
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,366
Ignore her.

763
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,063
That was very
thoughtful of you.

764
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,239
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

765
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,111
[scoffs]

766
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,721
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

767
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:20,809
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

768
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,637
our grief and our trauma.

769
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:23,943
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

770
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,553
and we gotta
finish those shows.

771
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:26,859
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

772
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,556
to give us a hand.

773
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,690
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

774
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,431
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

775
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:36,303
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

776
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,610
How convenient.

God, I thought I lost those.

784
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:46,912
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

785
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:49,567
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

Yeah.

I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

792

Did Grandpa make that?

793

[Lydia] No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,339
- Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
- Don't ever say that name!

Not ever!

799
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,300
- Beetlejuice.
- No! Astrid, I'm serious.

800
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:29,781
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

801
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,260
- is gonna happen.
- Like what?

802
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:33,262
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

803
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,916
Do you understand me?

804
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,265
[Astrid] Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,589
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

809
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,896
It's breathing exercises.

810
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,637
Try seeing ghosts every day.

811
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,117
Astrid!

812
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,206
- Let her be.
- [sighs]

813
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,860
God, she hates me.

814
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,862
[Delia chuckles]

815
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:10,560
[Lydia] Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

816
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,432
You blamed me
for your mother's.

817
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:14,129
She's not dead.

818
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:17,176
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

819
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,351
There's a difference.

820
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,918
You weren't very nice.

821
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:22,485
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

822
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,313
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

823
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:27,403
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

824
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:28,753
we have gotten closer.

825
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,537
No, I started liking you
before that.

826
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:35,324
[breathing heavily]

827
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:36,848
Again with
the creepy breathing!

828
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:38,719
It works!

829
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,765
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

830
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,288
[Delia] Of course you did.

831
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,203
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

832
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:46,292
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

833
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,163
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

834
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,643
in a skiing accident,

835
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:51,732
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

836
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,429
and we connected.

837
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,344
Yeah.

838
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,520
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

839
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,392
Okay, but this isn't about him.

840
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,263
Astrid found this in the attic.

841
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,135
Ew. So?

842
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,267
So?

843
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,574
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

844
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:09,010
Like he's lurking somewhere,

845
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:10,577
just out of reach.

846
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:11,883
But lately,

847
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:13,580
I'm seeing him again.

848
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,930
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

849
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,410
But now this?

850
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,499
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

851
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:22,502
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

852
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:24,025
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

853
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,158
who tormented me
all those years ago?

854
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:28,726
It's time to find her.

855
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,393
- [Astrid] Hey.
- Hey.

856
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:52,358
- [woman] Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

857
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,534
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

858
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,883
[woman] Okay. Have fun.

859

862
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,283
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

865
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,688
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

866
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,691
No, I troll old record stores.

869
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:33,399
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

870
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:36,010
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly. [chuckles]

871
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:37,707
[Astrid] Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

872
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:38,839
my mom would write.

873
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:41,668
What's the deal
with your parents?

874
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:44,062
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

875
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,804
in the kitchen stress-baking.

876
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:49,197
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

877
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,851
but then he had an accident,

878
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:53,854
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

879
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,335
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

880
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:00,774
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

881

882
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:05,039
[Astrid] Not really.

883
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:06,867
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

884
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:07,955
We used to have this big plan

885
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:09,435
where we were gonna visit

886
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:11,132
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

887

So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

888
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:17,486
[scoffs] yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

889
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:19,358
What happened?

890
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:22,535
A boat accident.

891
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,232
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

892
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:25,668
and they never found his body.

893

[sighs]

894
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:30,412
You really miss him.

895
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,025
Yeah.

896
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,461
You know,
I at least would have liked

897
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:37,115
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

898
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:38,551
But can't your mom,

899
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:40,161
I don't know, like,

900
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:42,642
contact him or...

901
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:43,948
She claims
she can't even see him.

902
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,906
- Why not?
- Because she's a fraud.

903
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,822
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

904
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,652
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

905
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:55,873
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

906
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,005
Because my dad,
he would go all out

907
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,833
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

908
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:01,574
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I think I was

909
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:03,881
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

910
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,709
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. It was a choice.

911
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,059
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

912
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,451
so I don't know,

913
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,149
probably be
my least favorite now.

914
00:48:11,323 --> 00:48:12,367
Well, what time's the wedding?

915
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,674
Midnight. The witching hour.

Well, why don't you
come over...

918
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,074
earlier?

919
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,990
Uh, we could,

920
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:30,037
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

921
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:34,912
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

What is up
with these creepy birds?

924
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,923
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

925
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,925
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

926

927

Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

Could be great press
for the show.

I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

936
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:13,298
but can we just keep it
small and private?

937
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,691
Yeah. Well, sure.

938
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:16,866
It's your big day.

- Dr. Glickman?
- Mmm.

[Jeremy] I, uh,
raided the basement.

1129
00:56:52,365 --> 00:56:54,454
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

1130
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:55,716
Yeah, you really went all out.

Yeah. [chuckles]

1132
00:56:57,762 --> 00:56:59,546
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

1133

Thank you. But yeah,

I look more like

Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>

1141
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,912
she discovered radiation.
Right?

1142
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:19,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1143
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:20,306
Yeah, her work was killing her.

1144
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,612
She didn't even realize it.

1145

I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

1149
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:34,538
It's probably
too much actually.

1150
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,235
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

1151

maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

Uh, I have a confession, actually.

1156

I'd rather stay up here

Okay. Yeah.

You're a ghost.

My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

1169
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,352
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

1170
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,093
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

1171
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,095
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

1172
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:55,270
And one day,

1173
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:57,751
I slipped

1174
00:58:57,925 --> 00:58:58,883
and fell.

1175
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:01,450

I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:09,633
I can't go any further
than that tree.

1180
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,810
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

1181
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:14,420
But then you came along,

1182
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:15,769
and you could see me.

1183
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:19,381
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1184
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,558
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1185

I know it's insane.

But I really like you,

1190
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:32,786
and I want us to be together.

1191
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,789
How?

1192
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:38,139
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1193
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:40,620
Well, uh,

1194
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:42,491
what if I told you

1195
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,276
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1196
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,279
To be human again.

1197

Um, it's all in this book.

1198
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,283
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1199
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,545
It's kind of complicated,

1200
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,852
but, uh, I can only do it

1201
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:58,682
with the help
of a living person.

1202
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:01,728
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1203
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:04,383
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

Yeah, well, I...

1206
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,998
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1207
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:12,521
to stay away.

1208
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,349
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1209
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:18,571
You'd get to see your dad.

Even Halloween.

1220
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:51,430
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1221
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:54,172
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1222

No, Delia.

Cemetery.

1225
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,874
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1226
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,835
I need to skedaddle, too.

Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1229

We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1230
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,583
We agreed nothing Disney.

1231
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,411
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1232
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:20,328
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

You'll never guess

- Fruit salad.

1235

Isn't that genius?

1236
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,075
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1237
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:29,947

On a date. Her first.

1242
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:44,091

than she is.

on Jefferson.

1244

Don't mention that street.

from a perfect sales record.

1247
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,100
Oh, it's my own fault.

1248
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:55,537
The place had been
on the market for years...

1249
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,018
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1250
01:01:58,192 --> 01:01:59,498
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1251
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:00,760
Murder House?

1252
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:02,457
Which house?

1253
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,286
125.

1254
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,027
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1255
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:08,768
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1256
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:11,815
- [unsettling music playing]
- Jeremy Frazier?

1257
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,947
I didn't get his last name.

1258
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,733
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1259
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:19,910
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1260
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:23,304
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1261
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,306
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1262
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,394
When they tried to get him out,

1263
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:28,353
he fell, broke his neck,

1264
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,094
died instantly.

I can. But since
