Come in if you dare.

6
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,193
The living.

7
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,701
The dead.

8
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,828
Can they coexist?

9
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,998
That's what
we're here to find out.

10
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:30,669
My name is Lydia Deetz,
and welcome to <i>Ghost House.</i>

11
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,338
Joining us in the attic tonight

12
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:40,010
are Emmet and Jody Welch,
from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.

13
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,251
Along with their dog, Taco.

14
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:44,717
And we're gonna hear about how

15
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:48,724
their dream home
became a ghost house.

16
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:53,758
I've been a psychic mediator
for over 15 years.

17
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,497
But nothing
could have prepared me

18
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,361
for what I encountered
when I visited

19
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,600
the Welch farm.

20
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,097
Here's a preview.

21
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,268
Be warned,

22
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:04,370
it's intense.

23
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,905
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna
find behind this door,</i>

24
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,318
<i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>

25
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,094
I feel a dark presence.

26
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,069
We need to leave! Now!

27
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:42,241
Emmet, are you ready to hear
about your paranormal visitors?

28
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,309
Bring it on.

29
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:44,948
How about you, Jody?

30
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,580
Haven't slept a wink

31
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:49,112
since we moved
into that darned house.

32
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,452
Taco was so freaked out,
he goes to the bathroom

33
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,949
in his doggy bed every night.

34
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,087
It's been a living nightmare.

35
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:01,459
Confronting the unknown.
Conquering your fears.

36
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:03,427
There's nothing harder.

37
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,795
But don't worry.

38
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,299
I'll be right by your...

39
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,674
What the...

40
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,838
No.

41
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:14,936
No, no.

42
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,040
What's going on?

43
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,574
- I don't know.
- Go!

44
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,514
No. No.

45
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,479
- Uh...
- You're doing great.

46
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,651
I'm...

47
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:27,192
Need a break?

48
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,150
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's take a break.

49
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:32,163
Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!

50
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,761
Bravo.

51
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:36,797
I need five. Make it happen.

52
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,701
Okay, everybody, that's lunch!

53
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:52,550
I told him
he needed to wear contacts.

54
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,649
But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician
wouldn't listen.

55
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:57,386
Oh, can you
give it a rest, Nadia?

56
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,248
I'm having a really shitty day.

57
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:01,789
Hmm?

58
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,496
What happened out there?

59
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,393
You okay?

60
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:10,101
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,203
It's these double taping days,

62
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,504
- it can get to me.
- Oh, God.

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,902
Kills me to see you
feeling like this.

64
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:18,443
Because when
you're feeling like this,

65
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,539
it just makes me
feel what you're feeling.

66
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:20,971
So in a weird way it's like,

67
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,741
when you're hurting,
it's hurting me.

68
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:25,076
- I don't know.
- God, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,941
I... I don't mean to make you
feel like that.

70
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:29,246
Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.

71
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,181
If anything, it just shows
how connected we are.

72
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,691
It's like we got the same
stupid little heart.

73
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,399
No. You don't need these.

74
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:48,539
Oh.

75
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:51,400
I have one job, and that is

76
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:53,445
to make sure that you do not
drown your talents

77
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,172
at the bottom
of a bottle of pills, Lydia.

78
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,708
Please...

79
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:59,380
just to get through today.

80
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,254
Okay. But...

81
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:06,954
this is the last time

82
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,624
that I ever dig pills
out of a trash can for you.

83
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,023
Do you understand?
Or a toilet or sink.

84
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,564
Here.

85
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,234
Okay? You got this.

86
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:19,361
- All right?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:26,142
- Is that mine?
- Don't move.

88
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:28,111
Who's texting me?

89
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,778
Your stupid stepmother.

90
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:32,275
She's got texting diarrhea.

91
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,412
I have to go.

92
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:37,113
Lydia...

93
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,952
we still have
a segment to finish.

94
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:51,536
<i>Tell us about</i>

95
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,469
<i>the inspiration
for The Human Canvas.</i>

96
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:54,803
<i>I am my own canvas.</i>

97
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,267
<i>I am my art.</i>

98
00:07:57,403 --> 00:08:00,473
<i>As we know,
art imitates the living.</i>

99
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,141
<i>It feeds me.</i>

100
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:04,611
<i>And I was not getting
enough nourishment</i>

101
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:06,583
<i>from the sculpture alone.</i>

102
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,411
<i>So, I decided
to broaden my tastes</i>

103
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,549
<i>and it turns out
I am insatiably...</i>

104
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:12,749
Delia!

105
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,317
Where have you been?

106
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,061
I think I've cried all
the water out of my body.

107
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,694
What happened to Dad?

108
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,157
I'm <i>desolee,</i> Le Tigre!

109
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,524
He is the Picasso
of graffiti artists.

110
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,932
He was tagging me like
the walls of the Paris Métro.

111
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,867
But now he's having
a <i>petite</i> tantrum

112
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:28,533
because I had to cancel
the performance.

113
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,003
What happened?

114
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,170
What? Oh.

115
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,871
Your father's left me.

116
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,345
He's divorcing you?

117
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:39,709
What a horrible thought.

118
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,981
No! He's dead!

119
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,549
What?

120
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,150
Daddy's passed away.

121
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:48,890
How?

122
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:51,693
He was returning

123
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,229
from his bird-watching
expedition

124
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,663
to the Funafuti Atoll...

125
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,202
<i>...when his plane
went down</i>

126
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,667
<i>in the South Pacific.</i>

127
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,836
A plane crash?

128
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:11,412
<i>That was
his worst nightmare.</i>

129
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,878
Actually,
he survived the crash.

130
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,049
- He drowned?
- Almost.

131
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:19,552
But not quite, no.
According to survivors,

132
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:20,748
Daddy clung onto a wing.

133
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,858
-  Over here!
-  Come on!

134
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,193
Hey, swim over!
Swim over!

135
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:27,324
Hey!

136
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,961
So, how did he die?

137
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:31,626
A shark jumped out of the water

138
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:32,703
<i>- and got him!
-</i>

139
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,101
Just like that.

140
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,604
I just spoke to him
on Saturday.

141
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:39,972
He was so excited,

142
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,107
he thanked me
for the binoculars,

143
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:44,446
he said he had observed
the mating rituals

144
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,143
of the Tuamotu sandpiper.

145
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,177
Yes, he flew halfway
around the world

146
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,747
to watch birds
do it on a beach.

147
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:50,886
And it killed him!

148
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,450
We need to tell Astrid.

149
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,222
Oh. Must we?

150
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:58,957
She's already
such a morbid little thing.

151
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,398
That's if I can even reach her.

152
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,599
We're barely on speaking terms.

153
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:03,959
Oh, it would kill Charles
to know

154
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,395
I had to cancel my show.

155
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,606
<i>Bonne journée a jamais!</i>

156
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:09,998
What'd he say?

157
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,475
Did you see that?

158
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,139
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>

159
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:49,308
Where am I?

160
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:52,908
Down the hall,
second door on the right.

161
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,648
Take a number.

162
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,149
Someone will help you.

163
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,790
Eventually.

164
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,519
Goddamn foreigners.

165
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:59,110
<i>♪ Night and day,
there's a burning down
inside of me ♪</i>

166
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:05,680
<i>♪ Oh, oh, burning love

180
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,183
Hey, toots!

181
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:45,516
You're not supposed
to be back here.

182
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,660
Don't make me tell you twice.

183
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,866
Where is Beetlejuice?

184
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:20,056
Ugh.

185
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,709
Ghost House!

186
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:38,871
When you're all
on your third kid

187
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,844
and second divorce,

188
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,243
we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

189
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,087
Perfect.

190
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,220
Leave me alone.

191
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:12,744
So it's settled. We'll bring
Charles home to Winter River.

192
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,275
But I've never
hosted a funeral...

193
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,438
I've never hosted anything

194
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,173
without Charles standing there.

195
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,079
Watching me. In awe.

196
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:20,878
<i>It's Astrid.</i>

197
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:22,382
<i>- Please don't leave a message.</i>
-  She won't pick up.

198
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:24,549
Maybe I should tell Astrid
about Charles.

199
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,780
Might be easier coming from

200
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,422
a non-feminine
masculine archetype.

201
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,123
Well, there aren't any men
left in the family.

202
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,558
Well, no offense taken, Delia.

203
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,395
I'll be a member of the family
soon enough.

204
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,167
In fact,

205
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,728
I might be the perfect person
to tell her.

206
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:42,065
Having just lost
my own grandfather.

207
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,001
You did? When?

208
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,834
Forty years ago.

209
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:49,275
But in my child body,
that's yesterday.

210
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:50,906
I'm gonna
tell Astrid, okay?

211
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,311
Just give me a few minutes
before you come up.

212
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,018
Enough!
I'll handle this.

213
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,582
Astrid!

214
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:00,750
Astrid!

215
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:02,785
Astrid!

216
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,962
Stop torturing your mother.

217
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,923
I know I usually find it funny,

218
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,494
and only fair
after the way she treated me

219
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,930
when she was your age.

220
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,499
But not today!

221
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,300
Your mummy's lost her daddy.

222
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,669
You've lost your grandpa.

223
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:21,511
And I've lost my...

224
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,014
horny handyman.

225
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:25,214
Charles.

226
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,612
Charles!

227
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:31,121
Oh, Charles!

228
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,656
Can't believe Grandpa is dead.

229
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,823
He's like the only semi-normal
person in this family.

230
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,029
We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

231
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,627
What do you mean
for a few weeks?

232
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:44,034
I thought we were just
going for the funeral.

233
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,460
Well, we need to clear out
the house.

234
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:46,994
Grandpa loved that place.

235
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:48,638
Yes, and we are going
to honor him

236
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,674
with a Grief Collective.

237
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,607
A "Grief Collective"?

238
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:57,978
I am seeing a semi-multimedia
visual manifesto of our loss.

239
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,442
What does loss look like?

240
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,311
Is it just tears? A headstone?

241
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:03,813
Wilting gladioli?

242
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:07,223
No, we need to unpack
the art of sorrow.

243
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:10,989
Yeah, that sounds
really traumatic.

244
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,090
I can't go.

245
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,858
I'm our school rep

246
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,662
for our Student Environmental
Conference next week.

247
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:17,333
We're presenting our demands
on climate change action.

248
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,565
I spoke with the principal,
and they cleared it.

249
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,965
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

250
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:23,868
Yeah, well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

251
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,668
the principal becomes your
little puppet on a string.

252
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,037
Well, you're free
to reject your inheritance

253
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,280
when you're living high
off a tree hugger's salary.

254
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,220
What? No! No!

255
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:41,385
Jesus! Okay,
people already know

256
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,117
that Lydia Deetz is my mom.

257
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:46,191
Okay, can you stop being
a freak for, like, one second?

258
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,694
- Go back.
- Why?

259
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:50,266
All right, people already know
you'd rather spend

260
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,070
more time with ghosts
than your own daughter.

261
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,729
Jesus, Bob.

262
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,568
Can't you see
I'm concentrating here?

263
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:30,769
You know, Bob,

264
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:33,142
long distance relationships
can be difficult.

265
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:34,904
Especially when
one of you is dead

266
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,470
and the other's ignoring you
for 30 years.

267
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:37,939
But Lydia and I,

268
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,879
we have a definite
psychic connection.

269
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:41,449
<i>I just need
these people out of my house.</i>

270
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:44,179
Please hold! Afterlife
Call Center, please hold.

271
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:46,487
<i>How much
for a premium bio exorcism?</i>

272
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:47,915
And I'll tell ya something,

273
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,622
she definitely saw me
that last time.

274
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,493
I felt a little tingle.

275
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:53,888
<i>The money back
guarantee one.</i>

276
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:55,830
I'm putting your call
through now.

277
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,132
<i>I've just died,
and she's already remarried.</i>

278
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,963
Sell him the honeymoon package.

279
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,466
I'll kill the new husband,
and I'll possess the ex-wife.

280
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:02,030
I'll make her
do some unseemly things,

281
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,636
and then I'll post the pics.

282
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,033
<i>Can I pay
in installments?</i>

283
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:12,006
I'm needed upstairs.

284
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:14,350
Bob, hold down the fort.

285
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:24,688
<i>Ou je suis?</i>

286
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:26,030
- Where am I?
-  Take a number,

287
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,165
take a seat.

288
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,602
I'm more of a dog person.

289
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:42,103
You! Room 515. Now.

290
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,086
- Come on.
- Come on.

291
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,483
Hey,
easy with the suit.

292
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:51,481
Don't "Detective" me,

293
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,882
you walking disaster.

294
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:54,456
- We got reports.
- Another protestor.

295
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:55,852
<i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>

296
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:59,989
Wolf Jackson,
Afterlife Crime Unit.

297
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:02,200
Let me take a wild stab.

298
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,690
Actor.

299
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:06,062
Not just any actor.

300
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:09,400
I've done it all.
For six movies and a reboot,

301
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,704
I became Frank Hardballer.

302
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,077
Doing my own stunts
was non-negotiable.

303
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,941
- You know why?
- Authenticity.

304
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:17,511
Correct.

305
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,913
A vice cop doesn't
get to a perp's door

306
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:23,379
and then call for some hambone
stunt man to break it down.

307
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,151
Neither did I.

308
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,819
You gotta keep it real.

309
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:28,490
Looks like you got a little
too real there, bud.

310
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,120
Who knew it was a live grenade?

311
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,130
Your name came up

312
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,634
on this case I'm investigating.

313
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:42,867
Recognize this puss?

314
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:46,710
Never seen that chick
before in my life.

315
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,905
Or afterlife.

316
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,677
Any idea

317
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:56,512
why my suspect wrote your name

318
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:58,378
in this schmo's goo?

319
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:02,225
Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,
but could be a super-fan.

320
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,955
You know,
guys like you and me...

321
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,086
...we drive the gals crazy.

322
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,055
She collected
all her body parts.

323
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:11,402
My hunch
is she's out for revenge.

324
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,798
And you seem to be <i>numero uno</i>
on her hit list.

325
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,104
Well, wouldn't be
the first woman

326
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,438
who wanted to kill me.

327
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,468
And kinda hard
to kill a dead guy.

328
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:20,767
This gal can.

329
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:22,576
She's a soul sucker.

330
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:24,315
Oh, yeah,
you could say that again.

331
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:28,419
My advice, lay low.

332
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,312
She gets her hands on you
and you're dead-dead.

333
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,252
And there's no coming back
from that, Mr. Juice.

334
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:35,491
Roger that.

335
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:44,129

00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:30,674
I just don't believe
I won't see Charles again.

346
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,282
Be comforted in the knowledge

347
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,649
that he's in
a far better place.

348
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:37,081
Angels are guiding him
towards everlasting light

349
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:39,717
and may his soul fly through
the heavenly gates,

350
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:41,655
like the birds
that he so adored

351
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,423
and soar over
the Fields of Elysium

352
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:45,154
to the glory that is thine.

353
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:47,156
What?

354
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,100
I haven't been to a funeral
since Dad's.

355
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,333
Death is hard.

356
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,974
Yeah, sometimes
I think life is harder.

357
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:05,207
I know.

358
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:10,184
Listen, if you wanna talk
to that therapist again...

359
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,279
There you go again.

360
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:13,686
You just sidestep

361
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:14,986
every possible
conversation about him.

362
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,922
Astrid...

363
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,393
I loved your father,

364
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,694
but our relationship was over

365
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,599
a long time
before the accident.

366
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:26,965
I still don't understand
why you can't see him.

367
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,773
- Why not?
- I wish I knew.

368
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,169
But this ability

369
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:37,074
didn't exactly
come with instructions.

370
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:40,446
It all started
when I was your age.

371
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:42,276
It's ironic, isn't it?

372
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:43,778
You can apparently
see any random ghost

373
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,413
for your shitty TV show,

374
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:46,452
but the one ghost
that actually matters to me

375
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:47,948
you can't see at all.

376
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,777
We are closed!

377
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:12,613
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Charles Deetz.

378
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,742
I'm feeling
a little lightheaded.

379
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:16,018
Where am I?

380
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,714
Damn newbies.

381
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,985
You wait! In waiting room!

382
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:22,920
All right.

383
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:25,122
Unbelievable.

384
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,471
Hey...

385
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,969
who's there?

386
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:35,028
- My ex-wife is back.
- Hmm?

387
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,192
Well, I know
what you're thinking...

388
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,662
"When was the Juice
ever tied down?

389
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:44,108
What kind of woman could ever
keep him satisfied?" Well...

390
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,109
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

391
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:01,101
Now she's back,

392
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:02,372
and she's pissed.

393
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:33,634
Hey.

394
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:37,715
Must be pretty
noisy up here. Yeah?

395
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,080
In here, too.

396
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,513
Listen, if you ever
need to process

397
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:46,515
any of your emotions,
I'm here for you.

398
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:52,753
Emotions processed. Thanks.

399
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:55,458
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

400
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,263
He must have been
a pretty dope dude.

401
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,597
Death is so, like...

402
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,702
It's, like, tragic,
you know?

403
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:10,913
I mean, if you ever wanna,
you know, cry or just,

404
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,473
kind of rage against
some of these feelings

405
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:14,383
that you have going on
in there,

406
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,714
I want you to know

407
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,018
that I could be that...

408
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:21,121
kinda dope dad-dude for you.
You know?

409
00:29:23,452 --> 00:29:24,661
- I'm good.
- You know,

410
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:25,724
times like this
can bring a family

411
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,892
weirdly closer together.

412
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,423
On the way over here,

413
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,094
I wrote a poem
for your grandpa.

414
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:33,463
Oh, did you? How does it go?

415
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,240
It's, it's, it's...

416
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,909
it starts...

417
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,674
It, well, it kinda like
opens on grief. Obviously.

418
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,442
And then acceptance.

419
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:46,647
It's long. I didn't memorize it
or anything like that,

420
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:48,318
but it's quite beautiful.

421
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,150
Cut the crap, Rory.

422
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:52,183
All right? I'm not falling
for your New Age,

423
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:54,083
overly emotional,
trauma bonding,

424
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:55,584
yoga retreat bullshit.

425
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,289
I see you.

426
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,453
Because, like you,

427
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:02,458
my mom is a very broken person.

428
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,296
Okay?
She's a delusional fantasist.

429
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,670
You just exploit her.

430
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:07,831
And if she wants
to allow that to happen,

431
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:08,971
that's on her.

432
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,615
I'm so sorry
for your loss. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:23,115
I know, I know. Thank you.

434
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:26,289
Oh, if it isn't
little Jane Butterfield.

435
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,823
Littler Jane?

436
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,215
Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee
now.

437
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,558
We hyphenated.

438
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:31,686
Is that Maxie Dean?

439
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,122
No.

440
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:35,525
No one's here yet.

441
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,563
Sample from
my hubby's microbrewery.

442
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:43,070
"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

443
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:46,409
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

444
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,506
It's a mourning shroud.

445
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:51,475
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

446
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,278
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

447
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:57,145
To a new life
with a new family.

448
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,654
I can't wait to show it.

449
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,248
Buyers are already lining up.

450
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:01,981
Thanks to you, Lydia,

451
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:04,185
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

452
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,820
Ghosts aren't real.

453
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:08,163
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

454
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:09,731
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

455
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,660
Okay, honey, in we go.

456
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:14,864
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

457
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:15,901
What?

458
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:17,435
We're gathered here today

459
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,006
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

460
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:22,206
Now, I only had the pleasure

461
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:23,871
of meeting Charles a few times.

462
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,180
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

463
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,880
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

464
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:32,184
Yeah, but he also...

465
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,255
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

466
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,524
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

467
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,323
Lydia,

468
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:40,521
now, I know
we had always agreed

469
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:41,598
to take
our relationship slowly.

470
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,197
But I can't wait any longer.

471
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,098
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

472
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:48,101
Will you marry me on Halloween?

473
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:49,500
-  Good Lord!
-  Uh...

474
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:52,100
That's... That's in two days!

475
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,569
Yes, I know.

476
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:54,510
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

477
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,045
The church is available.

478
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,374
The Lord's sanctuary
welcomes all who seek

479
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,082
salvation
and everlasting glory.

480
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,118
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

481
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,614
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

482
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,519
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

483
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:11,795
because as we stand here,

484
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,789
surrounded by death...

485
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:16,290
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

486
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:17,725
Because I want to spend

487
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,793
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

488
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,631
And you, Delia.

489
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,968
And you too.

490
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,702
And you. Again.

491
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,473
What do you say?

492
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:31,342
Rory, I... Come on,

493
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,577
I can't commit to this
right now.

494
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,713
Oh.

495
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,715
All right.

496
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,318
This is too much loss.

497
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:45,686
What do you mean?

498
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:47,261
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

499
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,790
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

500
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,363
which you know about.
And now the death of...

501
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:54,462
- us.
- No! No, I...

502
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,272
Come on, I didn't mean that.

503
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,902
Thought you wanted to take
life's great big bungee jump

504
00:32:58,037 --> 00:32:58,971
right beside me.

505
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:00,843
No safety nets, right?

506
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,375
But I guess,

507
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,342
the only thing
bungee jumping today is love.

508
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:06,977
And that cord just snapped.

509
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,950
Come on. Rory...

510
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,153
- I love you.
- And I love you.

511
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,154
Oh.

512
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:16,521
What are we waiting for?

513
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:19,991
Okay, I guess.

514
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,529
Oh, my God.

515
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:29,803
She said "yes"!

516
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:32,966
She said "yes"!

517
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,835

Sorry!

00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,254
- Sorry!
-  Watch out!

532
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:03,760
Whoa.

533
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,764
Are you okay?

534
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:16,944
Are you okay?
What happened?

535
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,941
Yeah. I'll live.

536
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:22,482
Uh, what are you reading?

537
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:25,350
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

538
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:27,118
- One of those.
-"One of those"?

539
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:28,684
What does that mean?

540
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,760
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

541
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,163
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

542
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,925
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

543
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:35,928
Yes.

544
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,796
Yeah, I...

545
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:41,136
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

546
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,733
Where have you been
all my life?

547
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,470
So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

548
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,805
My whole life.

549
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,480
I've never seen you
around before.

550
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,179
Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

551
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:55,647
for my grandpa's funeral.

552
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,485
Until my mom's janky fiance

553
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,948
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

554
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,357
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

555
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:06,294
Wow. That's different.

556
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,657
Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

557
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,122
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

558
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:12,169
Is your dad
in the picture or...

559
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:14,501
No.

560
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,273
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

561
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,010
Defender of hopeless causes.

562
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,309
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

563
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,840
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

564
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:26,674
But my mom grew up here.

565
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,350
That old house on the hill.

566
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,715
Wait. The Ghost House?

567
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:33,223
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

568
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,053
Unfortunately.

569
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:36,722
She's a legend.

570
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:38,822
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

571
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,725
You don't?

572
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,990
- No.
- Mmm-hmm.

573
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,659
I only believe in things
that I can see.

574
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,464
You know, science. Facts.

575
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,406
Oh.

576
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,436
Yeah, it's gonna keep going.

577
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:55,905
Back to the insanity.

578
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,173
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

579
00:36:58,308 --> 00:36:59,778
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

580
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,109
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

581
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:07,718
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

582
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:11,426
if you want a break
from the insanity.

583
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,087
Witness confirmed our suspect

584
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,132
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

585
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,225
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

586
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,696
Hit me.

587
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:52,726
After she turned the owner

588
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,799
into a human pancake,

589
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:56,634
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

590
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,337
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

591
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:00,770
has her twisted heart set

592
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:04,440
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

593
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,008
She won't stop killing,

594
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:09,011
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

595
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:15,253
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

596
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,725
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

597
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:21,628
Thank you, Janet.

598
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:24,125
You keep me real.

599
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,395
Should we take
this Beetlejuice

600
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:26,693
into protective custody?

601
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,036
See if you can find him.

602
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,531
He's probably laying low.

603
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,770
Scared out of his mind.

604
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,646
A little higher, boys.

605
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,648
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

606
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,322
Bob.

607
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,493
Like lookin' in a mirror.

608
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:55,123
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

609
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,929
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

610
00:38:57,065 --> 00:39:00,132
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

611
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,004
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

612
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:16,810
Now's my chance.

613
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,430
What?

614
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,098
Why?

615
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,596
No! No! No!

616
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:36,264
Delia, what's wrong?

617
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,869
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

618
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,539
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

619
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,837
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

620
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:43,673
- Why?
- For the Collective.

621
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,712
We cannot sincerely celebrate

622
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,349
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

623
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,350
Not until we release the horror

624
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:51,916
that they inflicted upon us.

625
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:54,347
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

626
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:57,050
He bought this house
without telling me.

627
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:02,091
Oh, my God!

628
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:03,896
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

629
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,528
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

630
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,397
It was Delia.

631
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:08,894
Oh, Delia.

632
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,264
I'm good.

633
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,308
Ignore her.

634
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,037
That was very
thoughtful of you.

635
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:16,239
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

636
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:19,680
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

637
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:20,775
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

638
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:22,575
our grief and our trauma.

639
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,913
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

640
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,520
and we gotta
finish those shows.

641
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,846
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

642
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,514
to give us a hand.

643
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:31,657
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

644
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,396
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

645
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,257
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

646
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,566
How convenient.

647
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:49,638
Ew.

648
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:39,046
Oh.

649
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,920
God, I thought I lost those.

650
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,891
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

651
00:42:47,027 --> 00:42:49,523
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

652
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:52,063
My water broke during
<i>Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>

653
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:54,904
Dad's favorite movie.

654
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,005
Yeah.

655
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,101
Can I keep this?

656
00:42:58,174 --> 00:42:59,774
Yeah.

657
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:01,743
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

658
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:04,174
Did Grandpa make that?

659
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,979
No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

660
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:09,619
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

661
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,092
Oh, I found that on the floor.

662
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:23,362
- Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
- Don't ever say that name!

663
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:24,964
Not ever!

664
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,264
- Beetlejuice.
- No! Astrid, I'm serious.

665
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,769
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

666
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:31,232
- is gonna happen.
- Like what?

667
00:43:31,368 --> 00:43:33,242
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

668
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,876
Do you understand me?

669
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:36,239
Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

670
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:53,321
Oh, my God, it's you!

671
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:55,594
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

672
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,894
It's breathing exercises.

673
00:43:58,029 --> 00:43:59,636
Try seeing ghosts every day.

674
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,100
Astrid!

675
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:04,173
Let her be.

676
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,833
God, she hates me.

677
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,513
Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

678
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,444
You blamed me
for your mother's.

679
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:14,110
She's not dead.

680
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:17,143
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

681
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:18,320
There's a difference.

682
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,854
You weren't very nice.

683
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:22,449
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

684
00:44:22,585 --> 00:44:24,287
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

685
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:27,362
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

686
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:28,696
we have gotten closer.

687
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,491
No, I started liking you
before that.

688
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:36,831
Again with
the creepy breathing!

689
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,666
It works!

690
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,738
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

691
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,239
Of course you did.

692
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:44,175
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

693
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,241
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

694
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,141
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

695
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:49,575
in a skiing accident,

696
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,715
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

697
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,418
and we connected.

698
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:55,254
Yeah.

699
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,493
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

700
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,352
Okay, but this isn't about him.

701
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:01,293
Astrid found this in the attic.

702
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:03,128
Ew. So?

703
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,228
So?

704
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:07,535
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

705
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,996
Like he's lurking somewhere,

706
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,568
just out of reach.

707
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:11,868
But lately,

708
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,534
I'm seeing him again.

709
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,903
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

710
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:17,371
But now this?

711
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,440
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

712
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:22,443
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

713
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:24,015
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

714
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:26,118
who tormented me
all those years ago?

715
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:28,681
It's time to find her.

716
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,367
-  Hey.
- Hey.

717
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,310
-  Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

718
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,547
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

719
00:45:54,683 --> 00:45:55,884
Okay. Have fun.

720
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,086
-  Hey, Dad.
-  Son.

721
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:04,255
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

722
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,563
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

723
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,672
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

724
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:21,633
No, I troll old record stores.

725
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:23,637
I don't trust
what I can't touch.

726
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,050
<i>Handbook for
the Recently Deceased.</i>

727
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:33,384
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

728
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,958
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly.

729
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,722
Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

730
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:38,828
my mom would write.

731
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:41,621
What's the deal
with your parents?

732
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,060
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

733
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:46,769
in the kitchen stress-baking.

734
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:49,164
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

735
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:50,805
but then he had an accident,

736
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,810
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

737
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:56,307
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

738
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:00,780
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

739
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,110
traveling, with a famous mom.

740
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,017
Not really.

741
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:06,852
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

742
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:07,951
We used to have this big plan

743
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:09,418
where we were gonna visit

744
00:47:09,554 --> 00:47:11,092
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

745
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:14,293
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

746
00:47:14,428 --> 00:47:17,460
yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

747
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,330
What happened?

748
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:22,498
A boat accident.

749
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,199
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

750
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:25,633
and they never found his body.

751
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:30,374
You really miss him.

752
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:33,981
Yeah.

753
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,444
You know,
I at least would have liked

754
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,111
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

755
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:38,519
But can't your mom,

756
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,147
I don't know, like,

757
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:42,615
contact him or...

758
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,891
She claims
she can't even see him.

759
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,861
- Why not?
- Because she's a fraud.

760
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,755
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

761
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:52,593
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

762
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:55,837
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

763
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,930
Because my dad,
he would go all out

764
00:47:58,065 --> 00:47:59,775
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

765
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:01,538
Yeah, I think I was

766
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:03,845
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

767
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,674
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. It was a choice.

768
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:08,042
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

769
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,411
so I don't know,

770
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,147
probably be
my least favorite now.

771
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:12,346
Well, what time's the wedding?

772
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:14,656
Midnight. The witching hour.

773
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,552
Future stepdad's lame idea.

774
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,963
Well, why don't you
come over...

775
00:48:22,058 --> 00:48:23,064
earlier?

776
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,926
Uh, we could,

777
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:30,038
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

778
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,911
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

779
00:48:35,677 --> 00:48:36,946
no pressure.

780
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:43,677
What is up
with these creepy birds?

781
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:45,887
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

782
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:47,918
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

783
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:49,816
you love in SoHo.

784
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:52,221
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.

785
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:53,924
Should be here later today.

786
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,426
Ooh, great. Thanks.

787
00:48:57,127 --> 00:48:58,561
And a, uh,

788
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:00,899
little bird may have
chirped our big news

789
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:03,005
to a few news outlets.

790
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,401
Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

791
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:07,143
Could be great press
for the show.

792
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,868
I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

793
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:13,273
but can we just keep it
small and private?

794
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,715
Yeah. Well, sure.

795
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,810
It's your big day.

796
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,621
Night. Whatever.

797
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:22,449
<i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>

798
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,159
<i>all through me. All through me!</i>

799
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:31,000
Lydia?

800
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:34,766
I want you out of my life!

801
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,862
Do you hear me?

802
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:37,567
Lydia?

803
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,836
Who are you yelling at?

804
00:49:41,972 --> 00:49:44,174
Do you remember that
couples therapist that we saw,

805
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:45,674
- Dr. Glickman?
- Mmm.

806
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:47,413
He said that I was holding
something back

807
00:49:47,548 --> 00:49:49,918
and until I faced it,
you and I wouldn't evolve.

808
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:52,446
- Mmm.
- Okay, well, he was right.

809
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:54,787
And I'm going to tell you now.

810
00:49:54,922 --> 00:49:55,956
And, fair warning,

811
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:58,626
it's gonna sound batshit crazy.

812
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,024
Are you okay with that?

813
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,559
Of course. I'd love to.

814
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:04,292
Let's break through
this barrier together.

815
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:06,134
Okay, just give me a sec.

816
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:11,503
When I was a teenager,

817
00:50:11,638 --> 00:50:14,834
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

818
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:16,541
and tried to force me
to marry him,

819
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:19,782
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

820
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,283
I believed he was gone forever,

821
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:24,577
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

822
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:27,254
And now, he is actually back.

823
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,884
And I don't know why,
or how, or what to do.

824
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,355
Okay, so you're saying that
someone called Beetlejuice...

825
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,855
Don't say his name!

826
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:38,797
If you say his name
three times,

827
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:40,300
he will appear.

828
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:45,537
Okay. So this...

829
00:50:45,672 --> 00:50:48,538
demon is clearly a construct
of your unpacked trauma.

830
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:50,077
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face,

831
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,641
otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

832
00:50:51,776 --> 00:50:54,776
He's not a construct.
He is literally a demon.

833
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:58,612
I know this
is a big step for you.

834
00:50:58,747 --> 00:51:00,385
But in the words
of Dr. Glickman,

835
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,454
I'm gonna give you
the push you need.

836
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:06,125
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

837
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:15,835
What just happened?

838
00:51:15,971 --> 00:51:17,337
We're in the model.

839
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:19,565
That's not possible.

840
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:24,737
What the hell?

841
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:26,278
I told you not to say his name!

842
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,747
<i>Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

843
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,485
<i>Don't ever
say that name.</i>

844
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,216
<i>Not ever!
We need to leave, now.</i>

845
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:39,088
<i>Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>

846
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,096
- Is that...
- Beetlejuice!

847
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:49,266
First of all,
I want you two kids to know,

848
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,138
this is a safe space. Okay?

849
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,636
Feel free
to express yourselves.

850
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,633
Don't be afraid. I sense
there's an enabler here,

851
00:51:54,768 --> 00:51:55,742
but we'll get to that.

852
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:57,008
Look, dig deep

853
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,143
and spill your guts.

854
00:51:58,278 --> 00:51:59,506
Okay? Who wants to go first?

855
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:01,078
Huh?

856
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:02,580
All right, I will.

857
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,419
There you go. See?
I'm willing to do the work.

858
00:52:08,555 --> 00:52:10,022
You two kids
need to get in touch

859
00:52:10,157 --> 00:52:11,619
with your inner child.

860
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,222
Mine'll be along
in just a jiffy.

861
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:31,037
Everybody says
he's got my eyes.

862
00:52:31,172 --> 00:52:33,883
Personally, I don't see it.

863
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:35,512
Scram, kid.

864
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:39,779
You're just my unpacked trauma.

865
00:52:39,914 --> 00:52:41,320
You're just my unpacked trauma.

866
00:52:41,455 --> 00:52:43,282
You're a figment
of my imagination.

867
00:52:43,418 --> 00:52:44,753
Really?

868
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:46,127
Is this a figment
of your imagination?

869
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:53,934
Leg man.

870
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:55,666
Just like his old man.

871
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:05,642
That was you stalking me.

872
00:53:05,777 --> 00:53:07,072
Hey, if stalking means

873
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,645
trying to remarry
the love of my life,

874
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:11,049
well, I'm guilty as charged.
Come here!

875
00:53:11,184 --> 00:53:12,749
Home, home, home!

876
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:31,703
<i>♪ Wherever you go
Whatever you do ♪</i>

877
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:37,239
<i>♪ I will be right here
Waiting for you ♪</i>

878
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:40,707
What happened?

879
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,713
I just had the wildest dream.

880
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,552
Yeah, I think
we should lay off the pills.

881
00:53:54,962 --> 00:53:56,489
Snakes?

882
00:53:56,624 --> 00:53:58,559
Actually, asps.

883
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,101
Aren't they beautiful?

884
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,633
Wedding gift for Rory?

885
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:04,570
Too late.
They've been defanged.

886
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:06,770
Guaranteed harmless,
and they're for me.

887
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:08,869
In Ancient Egypt,

888
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:10,378
a queen would perform
a ceremony

889
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,244
at the tomb of her pharaoh
using snakes,

890
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:14,381
the symbol of undying love.

891
00:54:14,516 --> 00:54:15,878
- Are you sure about that?
- Mmm-hmm.

892
00:54:16,013 --> 00:54:17,247
We read that
they were a constant threat

893
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:18,349
to Ra in the underworld

894
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:19,682
and represented total chaos.

895
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:20,922
Okay, see,
that's why schools need

896
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:22,619
more art and less reading.

897
00:54:22,755 --> 00:54:24,453
You got your wish,
we're leaving.

898
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:25,621
So go pack up your things,

899
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:26,795
I'm driving you back to school.

900
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,229
Wait, what happened?

901
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,429
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

902
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:32,597
I will pay
for a fleet of movers

903
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,627
to take everything
back to Manhattan,

904
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:35,995
except that model.

905
00:54:36,131 --> 00:54:38,234
We need to chop it up
and burn it.

906
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:39,668
Oh.

907
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:41,767
You're calling off the wedding?

908
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:46,946
What did that
cheese ball do now?

909
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:48,280
It's not Rory.

910
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:49,380
It's [mouthing] Beetlejuice.

911
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:50,544
He's here.

912
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,146
In the model. I saw him.

913
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:54,321
Rory saw him, too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

914
00:54:54,456 --> 00:54:55,753
Wait,
we can't leave yet.

915
00:54:57,451 --> 00:55:00,461
I have plans tomorrow
with this boy that I met.

916
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:04,626
How did you have time
to meet a boy?

917
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:06,359
You had time to get married.

918
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:08,794
She doesn't
mean it. It's just karma.

919
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:10,161
Whatever. I was biking

920
00:55:10,297 --> 00:55:11,939
and then I kinda crashed
into his fence

921
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,773
and we started talking,

922
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:14,871
and then he invited me over
to his place for Halloween.

923
00:55:17,178 --> 00:55:18,538
Can I go, Mom?

924
00:55:18,673 --> 00:55:20,076
Mmm-mmm.

925
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:21,174
Please?

926
00:55:24,412 --> 00:55:26,846
I will not allow
that menace to humanity

927
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:28,918
to upheave our family again.

928
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:32,258
No one goes in there,
no one calls his name!

929
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:34,121
We're gonna be fine, right?

930
00:55:34,256 --> 00:55:36,624
Mom, come on!
I'm gonna be late.

931
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:51,303
Trick or treat!

932
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,015
Are you sure
this is the right address?

933
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,718
Yeah.

934
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:00,516
125 Jefferson Lane.

935
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:02,347
Don't judge... all right?

936
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:03,952
His dad just got
into an accident at work,

937
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:05,355
and they're going through
a rough patch.

938
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:06,685
Trick or treat!

939
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,825
He's cute.

940
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,398
What are you doing?

941
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,761
I was gonna go
say "hey" to his parents.

942
00:56:11,897 --> 00:56:13,729
Seriously?
This isn't a playdate.

943
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:14,826
I mean,
we're not six years old.

944
00:56:14,962 --> 00:56:15,928
Nothing's gonna happen.

945
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:18,099
All right, okay. You're right.

946
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:21,239
Have fun,
and I'll pick you up at 10:00.

947
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,675
Not a second later.

948
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:27,713
Come on, quick!

949
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,387
Trick or treat!

950
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,131
I, uh,
raided the basement.

951
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,439
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

952
00:56:54,575 --> 00:56:55,701
Yeah, you really went all out.

953
00:56:55,836 --> 00:56:57,545
Yeah.

954
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,541
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

955
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:00,710
Thank you. But yeah,

956
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:02,347
my parents think
I look more like

957
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:04,110
Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>

958
00:57:04,246 --> 00:57:06,213
- Mmm?
- Your costume looks great.

959
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,923
Who are you supposed to be?

960
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,085
Marie Curie.

961
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:13,791
Two-time Nobel Prize-winning
French physicist

962
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:15,560
- and feminist icon.
- Oh, she was, uh,

963
00:57:15,696 --> 00:57:17,889
she discovered radiation.
Right?

964
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,168
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

965
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:20,267
Yeah, her work was killing her.

966
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:21,600
She didn't even realize it.

967
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:23,664
Yeah, well,
for someone who is dying

968
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,897
of radiation poisoning,

969
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:29,478
uh, you look beautiful.

970
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,073
I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

971
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:34,545
It's probably
too much actually.

972
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:36,211
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

973
00:57:36,346 --> 00:57:38,211
maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

974
00:57:38,347 --> 00:57:40,284
Or we could start
handing it out now,

975
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:41,816
if that's...

976
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:43,490
- what you wanna do.
- Yeah.

977
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:46,253
Uh, I have a confession, actually.

978
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:50,763
I'd rather stay up here
with you.

979
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:56,263
Okay. Yeah.

980
00:57:57,205 --> 00:57:58,166
That works, too.

981
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:32,633
Please don't freak out.

982
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:33,773
What are you?

983
00:58:34,737 --> 00:58:35,709
Don't you know?

984
00:58:37,604 --> 00:58:39,845
Astrid, really,
you don't have to be scared.

985
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,046
You're a ghost.

986
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:48,720
My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

987
00:58:48,855 --> 00:58:50,316
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

988
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:52,053
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

989
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:54,094
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

990
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:55,223
And one day,

991
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:57,724
I slipped

992
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:58,864
and fell.

993
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:01,402
How long ago did that happen?

994
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,698
23 years, 5 months and 14 days.

995
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:05,299
But who's counting?

996
00:59:05,435 --> 00:59:06,672
I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

997
00:59:06,808 --> 00:59:09,569
I can't go any further
than that tree.

998
00:59:09,705 --> 00:59:12,806
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

999
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:14,413
But then you came along,

1000
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:15,749
and you could see me.

1001
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:19,346
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1002
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:21,550
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1003
00:59:21,685 --> 00:59:22,756
It was amazing.

1004
00:59:23,555 --> 00:59:24,623
You're amazing.

1005
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:26,358
- I should go.
- Astrid, I know.

1006
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:27,723
I know it's insane.

1007
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:30,991
But I really like you,

1008
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,766
and I want us to be together.

1009
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:35,737
How?

1010
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,101
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1011
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:40,603
Well, uh,

1012
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:42,433
what if I told you

1013
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,239
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1014
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,248
To be human again.

1015
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,376
Um, it's all in this book.

1016
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:51,252
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1017
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,550
It's kind of complicated,

1018
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:54,819
but, uh, I can only do it

1019
00:59:54,955 --> 00:59:58,627
with the help
of a living person.

1020
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,696
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1021
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,360
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

1022
01:00:04,496 --> 01:00:06,892
'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

1023
01:00:07,027 --> 01:00:08,427
Yeah, well, I...

1024
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,962
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1025
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:12,465
to stay away.

1026
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,302
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1027
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,504
You'd get to see your dad.

1028
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:20,348
Again.

1029
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:36,659
I have the first
official open house

1030
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:38,227
a week from Sunday,

1031
01:00:38,362 --> 01:00:39,991
and then we will let
the bidding war begin.

1032
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:41,333
Where's Rory?

1033
01:00:41,468 --> 01:00:43,002
Supermarket.

1034
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:45,068
Swapping out the candy
I bought for carrot sticks.

1035
01:00:45,204 --> 01:00:47,438
Because Rory loves
to fun-suck everything.

1036
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:48,774
Even Halloween.

1037
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,372
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1038
01:00:51,507 --> 01:00:54,181
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1039
01:00:54,316 --> 01:00:55,310
No, Delia.

1040
01:00:56,243 --> 01:00:57,217
Where are you going?

1041
01:00:57,352 --> 01:00:58,720
Cemetery.

1042
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,854
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1043
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:04,819
I need to skedaddle, too.

1044
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:06,527
I'm co-chaperoning

1045
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,161
Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1046
01:01:09,296 --> 01:01:11,497
We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1047
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:14,525
We agreed nothing Disney.

1048
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:16,365
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1049
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,303
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

1050
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:22,136
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

1051
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:24,575
-  Mmm?
- Fruit salad.

1052
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,042
Isn't that genius?

1053
01:01:26,178 --> 01:01:28,046
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1054
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:29,916
I'm going as...

1055
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,480
"reverse mortgage."

1056
01:01:34,616 --> 01:01:36,483
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

1057
01:01:37,755 --> 01:01:39,151
Where is Astrid?

1058
01:01:39,286 --> 01:01:41,629
On a date. Her first.

1059
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,060
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

1060
01:01:44,196 --> 01:01:45,729
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1061
01:01:45,865 --> 01:01:47,898
Don't mention that street.

1062
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:48,997
I have a listing that's kept me

1063
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:51,163
from a perfect sales record.

1064
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:53,038
Oh, it's my own fault.

1065
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:55,503
The place had been
on the market for years...

1066
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:58,008
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1067
01:01:58,144 --> 01:01:59,510
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1068
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:00,749
Murder House?

1069
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:02,410
Which house?

1070
01:02:03,516 --> 01:02:05,246
125.

1071
01:02:05,382 --> 01:02:07,017
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1072
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:08,713
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1073
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:11,822
Jeremy Frazier?

1074
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,927
I didn't get his last name.

1075
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:16,697
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1076
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,867
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1077
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:23,266
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1078
01:02:23,402 --> 01:02:25,265
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1079
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,373
When they tried to get him out,

1080
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,374
he fell, broke his neck,

1081
01:02:28,509 --> 01:02:30,077
died instantly.

1082
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:38,013
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

1083
01:02:38,148 --> 01:02:40,245
Draw a door with some chalk?

1084
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,690
Oh, and knock three times?

1085
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,024
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

1086
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,122
So lame.

1087
01:02:54,795 --> 01:02:56,772
Or maybe it's not so lame.

1088
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,663
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

1089
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:00,599
I can. But since
you're still alive,

1090
01:03:00,734 --> 01:03:02,910
you have to read
that incantation first.

1091
01:03:05,238 --> 01:03:08,811
<i>"De mundo
vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>

1092
01:03:25,665 --> 01:03:26,659
Astrid!

1093
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:34,200
Jeremy, is that you?

1094
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:43,115
<i>"Ut liber iterum
ambulet alius."</i>

1095
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:45,914
Okay.

1096
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,581
I think that worked.

1097
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,352
Astrid!

1098
01:03:52,826 --> 01:03:53,829
Let's go see your dad.

1099
01:03:57,259 --> 01:03:59,131
Astrid! No!

1100
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:06,534
Okay.

1101
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,614
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

1102
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,887
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

1103
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:24,453
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

1104
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:26,587
Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

1105
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,354
Merry Christmas.

1106
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,723
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:33,526
Thanks.

1108
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,200
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

1109
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,211
Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

1110
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:48,313
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

1111
01:04:48,448 --> 01:04:50,545
That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

1112
01:04:56,822 --> 01:04:58,183
Whoa, dude.

1113
01:05:02,823 --> 01:05:05,132
Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

1114
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:09,366
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

1115
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:11,571
No, I haven't.

1116
01:05:11,706 --> 01:05:13,599
And I won't ever.

1117
01:05:13,734 --> 01:05:15,735
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

1118
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:19,244
Oh. Oh, that's good.

1119
01:05:19,379 --> 01:05:23,011
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

1120
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:24,716
Kings of Commerce,

1121
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:26,218
Knights of Nasdaq,

1122
01:05:26,353 --> 01:05:30,481
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

1123
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:33,059
You are no more, my king.

1124
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:35,259
But with the blessing
of the angels

1125
01:05:35,395 --> 01:05:36,998
of undying love...

1126
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:40,660
I, your surviving queen,

1127
01:05:40,795 --> 01:05:42,935
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

1128
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

1129
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:53,713
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

1130
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,214
Just pre-wedding jitters.

1131
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:57,045
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

1132
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,746
but don't come up

1133
01:05:58,882 --> 01:06:00,288
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

1134
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,418
Sure.

1135
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,084
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

1136
01:06:06,219 --> 01:06:08,022
-  Trick or treat!
-  Trick or treat!

1137
01:06:08,157 --> 01:06:09,457
Here we are.

1138
01:06:09,593 --> 01:06:10,932
- Apples...
-  Thank you!

1139
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:12,934
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

1140
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,502
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

1141
01:06:18,402 --> 01:06:19,975
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1142
01:06:21,441 --> 01:06:23,576
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

1143
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,274
The Juice is loose.

1144
01:06:57,774 --> 01:06:59,112
I need you to tell me
what this means.

1145
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,741
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

1146
01:07:01,877 --> 01:07:04,184
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

1147
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,247
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

1148
01:07:06,382 --> 01:07:07,914
He gets to come back,

1149
01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:09,418
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

1150
01:07:09,554 --> 01:07:11,320
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

1151
01:07:11,455 --> 01:07:12,650
- Soul Train?
- That's right.

1152
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:15,160
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

1153
01:07:15,296 --> 01:07:16,857
No, she can't
get on that train.

1154
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:18,566
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

1155
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,066
Well, I can get you in,

1156
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,300
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

1157
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:24,500
Of course there is.
What do you want?

1158
01:07:24,636 --> 01:07:26,374
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

1159
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,642
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

1160
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,410
She's kinda clingy.

1161
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,470
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

1162
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:32,911
You want me to marry you!

1163
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:34,545
I thought you'd never ask.

1164
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,280
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

1165
01:07:36,415 --> 01:07:38,111
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

1166
01:07:38,246 --> 01:07:39,549
Yikes!

1167
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,224
Okay, fine.

1168
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,123
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

1169
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:46,419
I'm gonna need that in writing.

1170
01:07:46,555 --> 01:07:48,056
- Give me that.
- Ow.

1171
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:49,196
And here we go.

1172
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:53,595
I'm gonna make you so happy.

1173
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,262
Jesus! What's the plan
on getting in?

1174
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:03,870
Yeah.

1175
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:08,413
Well, can't exactly
go through the front door.

1176
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:23,055
<i>We need
a demon possession.</i>

1177

1182
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,244
You never saw us.

1183
01:08:38,044 --> 01:08:39,004
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

1184
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:43,017
Bob, you and the boys
stand guard.

1185
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:44,845
Nobody gets through.

1186
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:47,848
Let's go, honey.

1187
01:09:08,135 --> 01:09:09,600
-  Trick or treat.
-  Trick or treat.

1188
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:11,139
Whoa, whoa.

1189
01:09:11,274 --> 01:09:12,437
One each.

01:09:13,773 --> 01:09:15,341
Yeah, right. Asshole.

1192
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:18,444
Huh?

1193
01:09:22,252 --> 01:09:23,586
Okay, everyone,

1194
01:09:23,722 --> 01:09:24,757
strawberries get first pick
this time.

1195
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:26,753
No crowding.

1196
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:39,967
Hands on your head, asswipe!

1197
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:42,573
Or I'll spray-paint the wall
with your brains!

Oh, no, dude.

1200
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:47,715
That was way too forced.

1201
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,914
Remember, throw it away.

1202
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,811
Underplay it.

1203

01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:59,023
We got a code 6-9-9 violation.

1207
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:00,658
You mean to tell me

<i>...6-9-9 violation.</i>

1210

Time to call the Ghoul Squad.

01:10:10,099 --> 01:10:13,575
I need a hard target search
for two suspects.

goes by the name

1214

And a female Fleshbag.

1215

One Lydia Deetz.

Excuse me!

1230
01:11:06,294 --> 01:11:07,920
What if a mistake's been made?

1231
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,028
Because I'm not
supposed to be here.

1232
01:11:16,597 --> 01:11:17,728
Seriously?

1233
01:11:17,864 --> 01:11:20,435
No. I have global entry.

1234
01:11:20,571 --> 01:11:22,567

1242
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:46,131
No. I feel strange.

You remember the chant

Uh, you agreed

-  Wait, no! Wait!
- Thank you very much.

Hey, where are we?

1295
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:32,318
I don't know.

1296
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:36,960
Hey, that's Saturn.

1297
01:15:37,095 --> 01:15:39,995
Right? So we must be
on one of its moons.

1298
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:41,800
I swear,
the Afterlife is so random!

1299
01:16:03,654 --> 01:16:05,890
Sandworm! Run!

1300
01:16:13,995 --> 01:16:15,530
Take my hand!

1301
01:16:22,168 --> 01:16:23,336
Here! Come on!

1302
01:16:52,933 --> 01:16:54,407
Marie Curie.

1303
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,504
After the radiation poisoning.

1304
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:58,074
Right?

1305
01:16:58,209 --> 01:16:59,405
Learned from the best.

1306
01:17:00,943 --> 01:17:02,111
We made a great kid.

1307
01:17:02,977 --> 01:17:04,982
Yeah, we did.

1308
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:07,655
Come here!

1309
01:17:10,986 --> 01:17:12,352
I know you can't see me,

1310
01:17:12,487 --> 01:17:15,253
but I check in on you both
all the time.

1311
01:17:15,388 --> 01:17:16,461
And I don't want
to be the reason

1312
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:18,297
that drove you two apart.

1313
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,425
You need each other.

1314
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:22,098
You make each other better.

1315
01:17:23,095 --> 01:17:24,133
Always have.

1316
01:17:25,632 --> 01:17:26,835
<i>Alert!</i>

1317
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:28,234
<i>We have a 6-9-9 violation.</i>

1318
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:30,074
We gotta get back
to Winter River.

1319
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:31,943
You can't leave until
Astrid gets her life back.

1320
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:34,605
<i>- Warning! Intruder detected!</i>
- Let's go.

1321
01:17:36,314 --> 01:17:39,412
The Ghoul patrol found
the breach and sealed it.

1322
01:17:39,547 --> 01:17:42,584
Any sign of Mr. Beetlejuice?
Or the Fleshbag?

1323
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,120
Still looking.

1324
01:17:44,255 --> 01:17:45,858
But we did find something
that might help.

1325
01:17:58,536 --> 01:18:00,004
Hmm.

1326
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:10,047
-"Bob"?
- Mmm?

1327
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:14,689
Let me tell ya
how this is gonna go.

1328
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:17,724
Your shriveled lips
will start flappin',

1329
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,920
or I'll crack
your itty-bitty skull

1330
01:18:20,055 --> 01:18:21,923
like a goddamn walnut.

1331
01:18:22,058 --> 01:18:23,262
Where's Beetlejuice?

1332
01:18:38,438 --> 01:18:39,913
-  Rory?
- Father...

1333
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,040
I'm seeing these shrunken
head people everywhere.

1334
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,683
Well, be not afraid,

1335
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,817
for thine eyes
will see strange things.

1336
01:18:45,953 --> 01:18:47,685
Are you filled
with fear and trembling?

1337
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,250
Yes! I'm shitting my pants.

1338
01:18:50,385 --> 01:18:52,351
- Ah.
- What are you doing here?

1339
01:18:52,487 --> 01:18:53,559
I'm searching
for the lost lambs

1340
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,058
to bring back into the light.

1341
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:57,523
Why don't I give you a ride
to the church?

1342
01:19:03,868 --> 01:19:05,905
Trick or treat!

1343
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:08,971
Sorry, sorry I just... I'll...

1344
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:10,442
I... Come right back, I just...

1345
01:19:10,577 --> 01:19:12,208
Excuse me. Just...

1346
01:19:12,343 --> 01:19:15,409
Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,
late for a wedding.

1347
01:19:15,545 --> 01:19:17,948
Hi, yes, one question,
how do I get out of here?

1348
01:19:18,084 --> 01:19:19,479
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

1349
01:19:19,614 --> 01:19:21,915
I'm on a break.
Take a number. Take a seat.

1350
01:19:22,051 --> 01:19:23,450
No, you see, those asps,

1351
01:19:23,585 --> 01:19:24,787
they were defanged.
I paid extra for that.

1352
01:19:24,923 --> 01:19:26,923
Honey, you're dead, okay?

1353
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:28,961
Now take a number and sit down.

1354
01:19:32,498 --> 01:19:36,803
Is there perhaps anyone here
who has the power to help me?

1355
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,370
Did that line
used to work for you?

1356
01:19:38,506 --> 01:19:40,304
I'm not dead!

1357
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:43,303
You know what?

1358
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:44,972
My husband's here.
Charles Deetz.

1359
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:46,705
Yes, he can fix this.

1360
01:19:46,841 --> 01:19:47,909
You call him, he can fix this,
he can fix anything.

1361
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:49,549
Not anymore he can't.

1362
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,083
No, wait! Wait, I know people!

1363
01:19:52,218 --> 01:19:55,614
Oh! I know people!
I am people! Why's...

1364
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:58,820
No.

1365
01:19:58,956 --> 01:20:00,828
Beetlejuice. Oh, no.

1366
01:20:03,797 --> 01:20:05,525
Beetlejuice.

1367
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:08,932
Right here.

1368
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:10,801
I get it. Now that you're dead,

1369
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,499
you wanna hang out with me.

1370
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:14,198
Would you help me
find Charles, please?

1371
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:16,167
And then the VIP lounge.

1372
01:20:16,303 --> 01:20:17,768
- Sure.
- Okay.

1373
01:20:17,904 --> 01:20:20,441
Just after you help me
find my runaway bride.

1374
01:20:22,483 --> 01:20:23,549
Ugh.

1375
01:20:33,553 --> 01:20:35,258
Hmm?

1376
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:38,826
Where is he?

1377
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,435
Tell me.

1378
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:17,399
<i>Stay behind
the line until called.</i>

1379
01:21:24,075 --> 01:21:25,275
Don't stamp that passport!

1380
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:32,050
You're too late, man.

1381
01:21:32,186 --> 01:21:33,811
I think it was Dostoevsky
who said...

1382
01:21:35,622 --> 01:21:36,583
"Later, fucker!"

1383
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:41,394
This way. Follow me.

1384
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:48,332
Next!

1385
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:51,235
<i>Warning! Intruder detected.</i>

1386
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,032
This way.

1387
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:56,340
<i>This is
a code 6-9-9. We have...</i>

1388
01:21:56,475 --> 01:21:58,011
Okay, this is as far as I go.

1389
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:00,581
- Okay.
- I love you.

1390
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:02,048
I love you too, sweetheart.

1391
01:22:03,344 --> 01:22:05,278
Have an amazing life.

1392
01:22:05,413 --> 01:22:06,550
You take care of each other.

1393
01:22:06,685 --> 01:22:07,886
Yeah.

1394
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:09,385
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1395
01:22:31,473 --> 01:22:32,947
Thank you for saving my life.

1396
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:39,151
I'm so sorry I never believed
that you saw ghosts and...

1397
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,955
I don't know,
I'm just sorry for all of it.

1398
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:44,924
Astrid, I...

1399
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,889
Lydia!
Come on, you're late!

1400
01:22:47,025 --> 01:22:48,552
Oh, my God! My wedding!

1401
01:22:48,688 --> 01:22:50,163
We're about to start.

1402
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,822
Wait, Mom, with everything
that's happened tonight,

1403
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,229
you know you don't
have to do this, right?

1404
01:22:53,364 --> 01:22:54,964
I know,
but if I don't do it now,

1405
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:57,099
I'm never gonna do it.

1406
01:22:57,234 --> 01:22:59,106
But are you sure about this?

1407
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:02,668
Rory loves me,
and that's gotta be enough.

1408
01:23:02,804 --> 01:23:04,574
Quickly, my dear!
Come! Come!

1409
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:05,804
Oh.

1410
01:23:08,976 --> 01:23:10,014
And the lost lamb
is welcome into thy house

1411
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:11,777
- with open arms.
- Oh, my God!

1412
01:23:13,745 --> 01:23:14,950
I thought you got cold feet.

1413
01:23:15,085 --> 01:23:16,385
Oh, no, blame me.

1414
01:23:16,521 --> 01:23:18,053
She just saved me
from my date from hell.

1415
01:23:18,189 --> 01:23:19,453
Who are all these people?

1416
01:23:19,589 --> 01:23:21,455
This is just
a couple influencers.

1417
01:23:21,591 --> 01:23:23,163
Nobody under
five million followers,

1418
01:23:23,299 --> 01:23:25,531
and I think we have
a Netflix executive in there.

1419
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,732
We doing this?

1420
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,627
Yeah. Where's your dress?

1421
01:23:28,763 --> 01:23:30,136
All that matters
is that I'm here, now.

1422
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:31,802
So let's just skip
straight to the vows.

1423
01:23:31,938 --> 01:23:33,137
Wait, where's Delia?

1424
01:23:33,273 --> 01:23:34,335
Yo!

1425
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:36,803
Right here.

1426
01:23:36,938 --> 01:23:38,339
She was helpin' me calm down
before the wedding.

1427
01:23:38,474 --> 01:23:39,879
I was feeling a little jittery.

1428
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,115
- All, right, beat it.
- You.

1429
01:23:43,312 --> 01:23:44,616
You're that thing...

1430
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:46,183
from my dream.

1431
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:48,114
Well, I'm really
more nightmare material,

1432
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:49,683
but, thanks.

1433
01:23:49,819 --> 01:23:51,454
-  You're...
-  Uh-uh.

1434
01:23:52,253 --> 01:23:53,554
Part of the deal

1435
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,055
is you can never,
ever say my name, ever!

1436
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,521
What deal?

1437
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,887
The deal she made to save you.

1438
01:23:58,023 --> 01:23:59,191
By the way,
you can call me "Dad."

1439
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:00,666
Lydia.

1440
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,728
You agreed to marry him?

1441
01:24:02,864 --> 01:24:06,036
I was desperate,
and it was my only option.

1442
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:07,536
Lydia. What's going on here?

1443
01:24:08,976 --> 01:24:10,739
Wow.

1444
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:12,674
Awkward.

1445
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:14,707
You haven't made much progress
since our last session,

1446
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:17,381
so I'm gonna suggest
some drug therapy.

1447
01:24:17,517 --> 01:24:19,849
Don't be afraid to share.
When you're ready.

1448
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:28,294
I always thought
your whole act was bullshit.

1449
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:30,762
I never believed in ghosts,
spirits, or any of it.

1450
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:32,956
What? All this time?

1451
01:24:33,092 --> 01:24:35,131
Why the hell
did you wanna get married?

1452
01:24:35,267 --> 01:24:36,530
Money!

1453
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:37,804
I knew I could make more
as your husband

1454
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,304
than I could as your manager.

1455
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,505
And I never
had a dead fiancee.

1456
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,211
I just went
to that survivor's retreat,

1457
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:47,038
so that I could meet
weak women and exploit them!

1458
01:24:47,173 --> 01:24:50,247
And I hit the codependent
lottery when I met you.

1459
01:24:50,383 --> 01:24:52,086
How 'bout a little
physical therapy?

1460
01:25:00,357 --> 01:25:01,722
We'd like to thank you all

1461
01:25:01,857 --> 01:25:03,592
for coming to this
very special occasion,

1462
01:25:03,727 --> 01:25:06,128
but right now
we'd like a little privacy.

1463
01:25:32,454 --> 01:25:34,156
Where you goin', <i>Padre?</i>

01:25:45,634 --> 01:25:46,764

Mr. Juice,

1506
01:30:08,698 --> 01:30:10,730
you've violated code 6-9-9!

1507
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:12,230
Freeze!

1508
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:14,867
Book 'em, Danno!

1509
01:30:17,077 --> 01:30:18,577
Beetlejuice!

1510
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,117
What the...

1511
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:25,551
I'm back.

1512
01:30:30,519 --> 01:30:31,914
Sweetheart!

1513
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,288
You look fantastic!

1514
01:30:33,424 --> 01:30:35,121
You look so...

1515
01:30:35,256 --> 01:30:37,594
- put together.
-  He's mine.

1516
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,895
It's me, not you.
You know, honey,

1517
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:42,501
I've been goin' through
a lotta changes lately.

1518
01:30:42,636 --> 01:30:44,402
Kind of a mid-afterlife
crisis, I guess.

1519
01:30:44,537 --> 01:30:47,632
Your soul belongs to me,
my love.

1520
01:30:47,768 --> 01:30:49,501
For eternity.

1521
01:30:49,636 --> 01:30:50,844
You don't wanna
spend your eternity with me.

1522
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:52,077
I'm a lone wolf.

1523
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,645
You need a soulmate.

1524
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,483
Somebody who really sees you.
For instance.

1525
01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:05,052
I need something
to draw with. Quick!

1526
01:31:39,018 --> 01:31:40,124
<i>Olé.</i>

1527
01:31:52,265 --> 01:31:53,672
- Let's go!
-  Hey!

1528
01:31:54,604 --> 01:31:56,308
We had a deal.

1529
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:57,974
She doesn't have to marry you.

1530
01:31:58,109 --> 01:31:59,944
- What?
-  You violated
code 6-9-9.

1531
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,539
Yeah, you illegally brought
my mom into the Afterlife.

1532
01:32:02,674 --> 01:32:05,013
According to that book,
that contract is null and void.

1533
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:11,156
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out between us,

1534
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,457
but the 600-year age gap

1535
01:32:13,593 --> 01:32:15,194
was a little bit much for me.

1536
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:16,626
- Beetle...
- Ah!

1537
01:32:16,761 --> 01:32:18,191
Beetlejuice.

1538
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:23,827
Beetlejuice.

1539
01:32:31,404 --> 01:32:32,946
-  Hey!
- Beetlejuice.

1540
01:32:43,425 --> 01:32:45,053
Shoulda got married in Vegas.

1541
01:32:53,492 --> 01:32:54,964
Looks like
we're a little late, boys.

1542
01:32:57,069 --> 01:32:59,163
Tape off the crime scene,
call in forensics,

1543
01:32:59,299 --> 01:33:01,938
and keep
the goddamn media away.

1544
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:05,210
Little lady, you just
popped his Beetlejuice.

1545
01:33:05,345 --> 01:33:06,678
Say your goodbyes,

1546
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:08,576
you can take a selfie now,
if you like,

1547
01:33:08,711 --> 01:33:09,946
but make it quick.

1548
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,451
Sister, you're comin' with me.

1549
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:15,385
What? Delia, what did you do?

1550
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,886
I fell for a scam,

1551
01:33:17,022 --> 01:33:19,759
and I'm counting on you
to claim a refund.

1552
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:21,450
Those snakes were actually
poisonous, weren't they?

1553
01:33:21,586 --> 01:33:24,794
Yeah. So, I died
of embarrassment.

1554
01:33:24,929 --> 01:33:27,028
Your work's gonna
go up in value.

1555
01:33:27,164 --> 01:33:28,734
- Oh! Oh, well, then.
-  Mmm-hmm.

1556
01:33:29,433 --> 01:33:30,898
Delia...

1557
01:33:31,033 --> 01:33:32,562
- I'll miss you.
- No, you won't.

1558
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:34,604
I'll find Charles
and we'll haunt you both,

1559
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,642
until you beg us to move on!

1560
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,744
Nice work
for a couple of Fleshbags.

1561
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:40,643
Don't come knockin'
until it's your time,

1562
01:33:40,779 --> 01:33:42,511
and in the meantime, remember,

1563
01:33:42,647 --> 01:33:44,348
you gotta keep it real.

1564
01:33:44,484 --> 01:33:45,783
Come on, beautiful,

1565
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:47,819
we got a date
with the commissioner.

1566
01:34:33,662 --> 01:34:34,734
Charles!

1567
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:37,671
Delia!

1568
01:34:40,035 --> 01:34:41,367
I can't believe you're here!

1569
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:45,578
Oh, Charles.

1570
01:34:45,714 --> 01:34:47,406
I'm so happy
to see you!

1571
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,579
Oh, Charles,

1572
01:34:49,715 --> 01:34:50,981
look what happened to me!

1573
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:55,716
This is the 10:13,

1574
01:34:55,852 --> 01:34:57,691

1577
01:35:12,104 --> 01:35:14,332

over the years,

but this is my last show.

1580
01:35:20,509 --> 01:35:24,010
I have spent so much time
talking to the dead,

1581
01:35:24,145 --> 01:35:26,214
it's time I started living.
