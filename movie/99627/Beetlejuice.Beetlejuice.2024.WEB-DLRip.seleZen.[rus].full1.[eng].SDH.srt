of meeting Charles a few times.

561
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,180
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

562
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,880
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

563

Yeah, but he also...

to take
our relationship slowly.

00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:16,944
[chuckles] Are you okay?
What happened?

647
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,941
[Astrid] Yeah. I'll live.

648
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:22,482
Uh, what are you reading?

649
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:25,350
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

650
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:27,118
- One of those.
-"One of those"?

651
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:28,684
What does that mean?

652
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,760
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

653
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,163
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

654
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,925
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

655
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:35,928
Yes.

656
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,796
Yeah, I...

657
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:41,136
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

658
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,733
Where have you been
all my life?

659
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,470
[Astrid] So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

660
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,805
[boy] My whole life.

661
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,480
I've never seen you
around before.

662
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,179
[Astrid] Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

663
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:55,647
for my grandpa's funeral.

664
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,485
Until my mom's janky fiance

665
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,948
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

666
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,357
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

667
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:06,294
[boy] Wow. That's different.

668
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,657
[Astrid] Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

669
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,122
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

670
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:12,169
Is your dad
in the picture or...

671
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:14,501
No.

672
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,273
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

673
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,010
Defender of hopeless causes.

674
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,309
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

675
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,840
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

676
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:26,674
But my mom grew up here.

677
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,350
That old house on the hill.

678
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,715
Wait. The Ghost House?

679
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:33,223
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

680
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,053
Unfortunately.

681
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:36,722
She's a legend.

682
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:38,822
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

683
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,725
You don't?

684
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,990
- No.
- Mmm-hmm.

685
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,659
I only believe in things
that I can see.

686
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,464
You know, science. Facts.

687
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,870
[cell phone buzzing, chiming]

688
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,406
[Jeremy] Oh.

689
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,436
- Yeah, it's gonna keep going.
- [chuckling]

690
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:55,905
Back to the insanity.

691
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,173
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

692
00:36:58,308 --> 00:36:59,778
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

693
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,109
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

694
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:07,718
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

695
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:11,426
if you want a break
from the insanity.

696

[camera shutter clicks]

703
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,087
[lieutenant]
Witness confirmed our suspect

704
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,132
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

705
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,225
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

706
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,696
Hit me.

707
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:52,726
[lieutenant]
After she turned the owner

708
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,799
into a human pancake,

709
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:56,634
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

710
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,337
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

711
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:00,770
has her twisted heart set

712
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:04,440
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

713
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,008
She won't stop killing,

714
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:09,011
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

715
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:15,253
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

716
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,919
[footsteps approaching]

717
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,725
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

718
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:21,628
Thank you, Janet.

719
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:24,125
You keep me real.

720
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,395
[Lieutenant] Should we take
this Beetlejuice

721
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:26,693
into protective custody?

722
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,036
See if you can find him.

723
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,531
He's probably laying low.

724
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,770
Scared out of his mind.

725
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,646
[Beetlejuice]
A little higher, boys.

726
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,648
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

727
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,246
[Bob grunts]

Bob.

730
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,493
Like lookin' in a mirror.

731
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:55,123
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

732
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,929
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

733
00:38:57,065 --> 00:39:00,132
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

734
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:01,365
[Bob groans]

735

[shouts] What?

742
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,098
- Why?
- [camera shutter clicks]

743
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,596
No! No! No!

744
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:36,264
Delia, what's wrong?

745
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,869
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

746
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,539
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

747
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,837
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

748
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:43,673
- Why?
- For the Collective.

749
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,712
We cannot sincerely celebrate

750
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,349
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

751
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,350
Not until we release the horror

752
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:51,916
that they inflicted upon us.

753
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:54,347
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

754
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:57,050
He bought this house
without telling me.

755
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:59,587
[rushing footsteps approaching]

756
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:02,091
Oh, my God!

757
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:03,896
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

758
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,528
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

759
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,397
[stutters] It was Delia.

760
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:08,894
Oh, Delia.

761
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,264
[exclaims] I'm good.

762
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,308
Ignore her.

763
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,037
That was very
thoughtful of you.

764
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:16,239
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

765
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,076
[scoffs]

766
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:19,680
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

767
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:20,775
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

768
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:22,575
our grief and our trauma.

769
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,913
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

770
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,520
and we gotta
finish those shows.

771
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,846
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

772
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,514
to give us a hand.

773
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:31,657
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

774
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,396
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

775
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,257
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

776
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,566
How convenient.

God, I thought I lost those.

784
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,891
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

785
00:42:47,027 --> 00:42:49,523
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

Yeah.

I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

Did Grandpa make that?

793

[Lydia] No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

- Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
- Don't ever say that name!

Not ever!

799
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,264
- Beetlejuice.
- No! Astrid, I'm serious.

800
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,769
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

801

- is gonna happen.
- Like what?

802
00:43:31,368 --> 00:43:33,242
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

803

Do you understand me?

804
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:36,239
[Astrid] Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:55,594
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

809
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,894
It's breathing exercises.

810
00:43:58,029 --> 00:43:59,636
Try seeing ghosts every day.

811
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,100
Astrid!

812
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:04,173
- Let her be.
- [sighs]

813
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,833
God, she hates me.

814
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:07,810
[Delia chuckles]

815
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,513
[Lydia] Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

816
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,444
You blamed me
for your mother's.

817
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:14,110
She's not dead.

818
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:17,143
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

819
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:18,320
There's a difference.

820
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,854
You weren't very nice.

821
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:22,449
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

822
00:44:22,585 --> 00:44:24,287
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

823
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:27,362
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

824
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:28,696
we have gotten closer.

825
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,491
No, I started liking you
before that.

826
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,296
[breathing heavily]

827
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:36,831
Again with
the creepy breathing!

828
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,666
It works!

829
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,738
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

830
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,239
[Delia] Of course you did.

831
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:44,175
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

832
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,241
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

833
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,141
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

834
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:49,575
in a skiing accident,

835
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,715
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

836
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,418
and we connected.

837
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:55,254
Yeah.

838
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,493
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

839
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,352
Okay, but this isn't about him.

840
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:01,293
Astrid found this in the attic.

841
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:03,128
Ew. So?

842
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,228
So?

843
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:07,535
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

844
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,996
Like he's lurking somewhere,

845
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,568
just out of reach.

846
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:11,868
But lately,

847
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,534
I'm seeing him again.

848
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,903
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

849
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:17,371
But now this?

850
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,440
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

851
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:22,443
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

852
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:24,015
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

853
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:26,118
who tormented me
all those years ago?

854
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:28,681
It's time to find her.

855
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,367
- [Astrid] Hey.
- Hey.

856
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,310
- [woman] Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

857
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,547
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

858
00:45:54,683 --> 00:45:55,884
[woman] Okay. Have fun.

859

- [man] Son.

862
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:04,255
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

865
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,672
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

866
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:21,633
No, I troll old record stores.

869
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:33,384
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

870
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,958
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly. [chuckles]

871
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,722
[Astrid] Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

872
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:38,828
my mom would write.

873
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:41,621
What's the deal
with your parents?

874
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,060
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

875
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:46,769
in the kitchen stress-baking.

876
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:49,164
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

877
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:50,805
but then he had an accident,

878
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,810
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

879
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:56,307
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

880
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:00,780
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

881
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,110

882
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,017
[Astrid] Not really.

883
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:06,852
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

884
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:07,951
We used to have this big plan

885
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:09,418
where we were gonna visit

886
00:47:09,554 --> 00:47:11,092
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

887
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:14,293
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

888
00:47:14,428 --> 00:47:17,460
[scoffs] yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

889
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,330
What happened?

890
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:22,498
A boat accident.

891
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,199
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

892
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:25,633
and they never found his body.

893

[sighs]

894
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:30,374
You really miss him.

895
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:33,981
Yeah.

896
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,444
You know,
I at least would have liked

897
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,111
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

898
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:38,519
But can't your mom,

899
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,147
I don't know, like,

900
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:42,615
contact him or...

901
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,891
She claims
she can't even see him.

902
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,861
- Why not?
- Because she's a fraud.

903
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,755
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

904
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:52,593
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

905
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:55,837
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

906
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,930
Because my dad,
he would go all out

907
00:47:58,065 --> 00:47:59,775
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

908
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:01,538
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I think I was

909
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:03,845
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

910
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,674
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. It was a choice.

911
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:08,042
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

912
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,411
so I don't know,

913
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,147
probably be
my least favorite now.

914
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:12,346
Well, what time's the wedding?

915
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:14,656
Midnight. The witching hour.

Well, why don't you
come over...

918
00:48:22,058 --> 00:48:23,064
earlier?

919
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,926
Uh, we could,

920
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:30,038
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

921
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,911
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

What is up
with these creepy birds?

924
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:45,887
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

925
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:47,918
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

926

927

potential wedding dresses.

928

Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:07,143
Could be great press
for the show.

I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

936
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:13,273
but can we just keep it
small and private?

937
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,715
Yeah. Well, sure.

938
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,810
It's your big day.

- Dr. Glickman?
- Mmm.

you and I wouldn't evolve.

[Jeremy] I, uh,
raided the basement.

1129
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,439
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

1130
00:56:54,575 --> 00:56:55,701
Yeah, you really went all out.

Yeah. [chuckles]

1132
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,541
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

1133
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:00,710
Thank you. But yeah,

I look more like

Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>

- Your costume looks great.

1141
00:57:15,696 --> 00:57:17,889
she discovered radiation.
Right?

1142
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,168
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1143
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:20,267
Yeah, her work was killing her.

1144
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:21,600
She didn't even realize it.

1145

I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

1149
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:34,545
It's probably
too much actually.

1150
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:36,211
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

1151

maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

Uh, I have a confession, actually.

1156

Okay. Yeah.

You're a ghost.

My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

1169
00:58:48,855 --> 00:58:50,316
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

1170
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:52,053
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

1171
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:54,094
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

1172
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:55,223
And one day,

1173
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:57,724
I slipped

1174
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:58,864
and fell.

1175
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:01,402

I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

00:59:06,808 --> 00:59:09,569
I can't go any further
than that tree.

1180
00:59:09,705 --> 00:59:12,806
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

1181
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:14,413
But then you came along,

1182
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:15,749
and you could see me.

1183
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:19,346
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1184
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:21,550
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1185

I know it's insane.

But I really like you,

1190
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,766
and I want us to be together.

1191
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:35,737
How?

1192
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,101
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1193
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:40,603
Well, uh,

1194
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:42,433
what if I told you

1195
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,239
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1196
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,248
To be human again.

1197

Um, it's all in this book.

1198
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:51,252
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1199
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,550
It's kind of complicated,

1200
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:54,819
but, uh, I can only do it

1201
00:59:54,955 --> 00:59:58,627
with the help
of a living person.

1202
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,696
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1203
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,360
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

Yeah, well, I...

1206
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,962
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1207
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:12,465
to stay away.

1208
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,302
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1209
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,504
You'd get to see your dad.

Even Halloween.

1220
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,372
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1221
01:00:51,507 --> 01:00:54,181
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1222

No, Delia.

Cemetery.

1225
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,854
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1226
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:04,819
I need to skedaddle, too.

Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1229

We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1230
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:14,525
We agreed nothing Disney.

1231
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:16,365
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1232
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,303
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

You'll never guess

- Fruit salad.

1235

Isn't that genius?

1236
01:01:26,178 --> 01:01:28,046
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1237
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:29,916
I'm going as...

On a date. Her first.

1242
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,060

than she is.

The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1244

Don't mention that street.

from a perfect sales record.

1247
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:53,038
Oh, it's my own fault.

1248
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:55,503
The place had been
on the market for years...

1249
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:58,008
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1250
01:01:58,144 --> 01:01:59,510
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1251
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:00,749
Murder House?

1252
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:02,410
Which house?

1253
01:02:03,516 --> 01:02:05,246
125.

1254
01:02:05,382 --> 01:02:07,017
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1255
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:08,713
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1256
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:11,822
- [unsettling music playing]
- Jeremy Frazier?

1257
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,927
I didn't get his last name.

1258
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:16,697
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1259
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,867
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1260
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:23,266
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1261
01:02:23,402 --> 01:02:25,265
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1262
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,373
When they tried to get him out,

1263
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,374
he fell, broke his neck,

1264
01:02:28,509 --> 01:02:30,077
died instantly.

I can. But since
you're still alive,

you have to read
