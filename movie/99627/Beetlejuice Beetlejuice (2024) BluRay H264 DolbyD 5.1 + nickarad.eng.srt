6
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,267
The living.

7
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,669
The dead.

8
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,771
Can they coexist?

9
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,907
That's what
we're here to find out.

10
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,644
My name is Lydia Deetz,
and welcome to <i>Ghost House.</i>

11
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,248
Joining us in the attic tonight

12
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,920
are Emmet and Jody Welch,
from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.

13
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:42,322
Along with their dog, Taco.

14
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,591
And we're gonna hear about how

15
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,695
their dream home
became a ghost house.

16
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,734
I've been a psychic mediator
for over 15 years.

17
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,502
But nothing
could have prepared me

18
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,403
for what I encountered
when I visited

19
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,538
the Welch farm.

20
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,941
Here's a preview.

21
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,342
Be warned,

22
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,410
it's intense.

23
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,850
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna</i>
<i>find behind this door,</i>

24
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:12,319
<i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>

25
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,006
I feel a dark presence.

26
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,975
We need to leave! Now!

27
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,314
Emmet, are you ready to hear
about your paranormal visitors?

28
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,382
Bring it on.

29
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,885
How about you, Jody?

30
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,586
Haven't slept a wink

31
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,022
since we moved
into that darned house.

32
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:51,491
Taco was so freaked out,
he goes to the bathroom

33
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,895
in his doggy bed every night.

34
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,997
It's been a living nightmare.

35
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,501
Confronting the unknown.
Conquering your fears.

36
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,469
There's nothing harder.

37
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,771
But don't worry.

38
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,372
I'll be right by your...

39
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,677
What the...

40
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,745
No.

41
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,881
No, no.

42
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:14,916
What's going on?

43
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,585
-I don't know.
-Go!

44
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,554
No. No.

45
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,522
-Uh...
-You're doing great.

46
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,658
I'm...

47
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,093
Need a break?

48
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,062
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's take a break.

49
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:31,065
Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!

50
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,667
Bravo.

51
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,703
I need five. Make it happen.

52
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,639
Okay, everybody, that's lunch!

53
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,586
I told him
he needed to wear contacts.

54
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,655
But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician
wouldn't listen.

55
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,456
Oh, can you
give it a rest, Nadia?

56
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,092
I'm having a really shitty day.

57
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,695
Hmm?

58
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,464
What happened out there?

59
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,467
You okay?

60
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,036
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,105
It's these double taping days,

62
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,541
-it can get to me.
-Oh, God.

63
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,877
Kills me to see you
feeling like this.

64
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,144
Because when
you're feeling like this,

65
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,579
it just makes me
feel what you're feeling.

66
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,914
So in a weird way it's like,

67
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,749
when you're hurting,
it's hurting me.

68
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,018
-I don't know.
-God, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,920
I... I don't mean to make you
feel like that.

70
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,155
Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.

71
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,024
If anything, it just shows
how connected we are.

72
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,629
It's like we got the same
stupid little heart.

73
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,473
No. You don't need these.

74
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,508
Oh.

75
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,477
I have one job, and that is

76
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,513
to make sure that you do not
drown your talents

77
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,015
at the bottom
of a bottle of pills, Lydia.

78
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,717
Please...

79
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,451
just to get through today.

80
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,158
Okay. But...

81
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,893
this is the last time

82
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,662
that I ever dig pills
out of a trash can for you.

83
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,897
Do you understand?
Or a toilet or sink.

84
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,533
Here.

85
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,138
Okay? You got this.

86
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,172
-All right?
-Yeah.

87
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,079
-Is that mine?
-Don't move.

88
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,048
Who's texting me?

89
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,716
Your stupid stepmother.

90
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,118
She's got texting diarrhea.

91
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,487
I have to go.

92
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:36,057
Lydia...

93
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,858
we still have
a segment to finish.

94
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,571
<i>Tell us about</i>

95
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,540
<i>the inspiration</i>
<i>for The Human Canvas.</i>

96
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,741
<i>I am my own canvas.</i>

97
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,177
<i>I am my art.</i>

98
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,547
<i>As we know,</i>
<i>art imitates the living.</i>

99
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,048
<i>It feeds me.</i>

100
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:03,651
<i>And I was not getting</i>
<i>enough nourishment</i>

101
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,619
<i>from the sculpture alone.</i>

102
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,289
<i>So, I decided</i>
<i>to broaden my tastes</i>

103
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,624
<i>and it turns out</i>
<i>I am insatiably...</i>

104
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:11,759
Delia!

105
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,194
Where have you been?

106
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,029
I think I've cried all
the water out of my body.

107
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,731
What happened to Dad?

108
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm <i>desolee,</i> Le Tigre!

109
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,602
He is the Picasso
of graffiti artists.

110
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,904
He was tagging me like
the walls of the Paris Métro.

111
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,873
But now he's having
a <i>petite</i> tantrum

112
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,608
because I had to cancel
the performance.

113
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,909
What happened?

114
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,045
What? Oh.

115
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,882
Your father's left me.

116
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,250
He's divorcing you?

117
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,753
What a horrible thought.

118
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:39,887
No! He's dead!

119
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,623
What?

120
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,025
Daddy's passed away.

121
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,828
How?

122
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,698
He was returning

123
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,166
from his bird-watching
expedition

124
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,701
to the Funafuti Atoll...

125
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,138
<i>...when his plane</i>
<i>went down</i>

126
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,706
<i>in the South Pacific.</i>

127
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,845
A plane crash?

128
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,317
<i>That was</i>
<i>his worst nightmare.</i>

129
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,888
Actually,
he survived the crash.

130
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,023
-He drowned?
-Almost.

131
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,626
But not quite, no.
According to survivors,

132
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,794
Daddy clung onto a wing.

133
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,863
- Over here!
- Come on!

134
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,132
Hey, swim over!
Swim over!

135
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,167
Hey!

136
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,969
So, how did he die?

137
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,671
A shark jumped out of the water

138
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:31,672
<i>and got him!</i>

139
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,008
Just like that.

140
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,678
I just spoke to him
on Saturday.

141
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,946
He was so excited,

142
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,082
he thanked me
for the binoculars,

143
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,350
he said he had observed
the mating rituals

144
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,119
of the Tuamotu sandpiper.

145
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,121
Yes, he flew halfway
around the world

146
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,789
to watch birds
do it on a beach.

147
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:49,824
And it killed him!

148
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,294
We need to tell Astrid.

149
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,163
Oh. Must we?

150
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:57,965
She's already
such a morbid little thing.

151
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,300
That's if I can even reach her.

152
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,669
We're barely on speaking terms.

153
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,970
Oh, it would kill Charles
to know

154
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,306
I had to cancel my show.

155
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,607
<i>Bonne journée a jamais!</i>

156
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,009
What'd he say?

157
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,319
Did you see that?

158
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,045
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>

159
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,249
Where am I?

160
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:51,919
Down the hall,
second door on the right.

161
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,721
Take a number.

162
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,055
Someone will help you.

163
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,725
Eventually.

164
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,363
Goddamn foreigners.

165

Hey, toots!

181
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,391
You're not supposed
to be back here.

182
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,562
Don't make me tell you twice.

183
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,867
Where is Beetlejuice?

184
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:19,026
Ugh.

185
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,611
Ghost House!

186
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:37,945
When you're all
on your third kid

187
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,913
and second divorce,

188
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,181
we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

189
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,057
Perfect.

190
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,230
Leave me alone.

191
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,646
So it's settled. We'll bring
Charles home to Winter River.

192
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,280
But I've never
hosted a funeral...

193
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,381
I've never hosted anything

194
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,183
without Charles standing there.

195
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,118
Watching me. In awe.

196
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,721
<i>It's Astrid.</i>

197
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,355
<i>- Please don't leave a message.</i>
- She won't pick up.

198
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,424
Maybe I should tell Astrid
about Charles.

199
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:25,660
Might be easier coming from

200
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,394
a non-feminine
masculine archetype.

201
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,164
Well, there aren't any men
left in the family.

202
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,499
Well, no offense taken, Delia.

203
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:34,301
I'll be a member of the family
soon enough.

204
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,171
In fact,

205
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,640
I might be the perfect person
to tell her.

206
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:41,108
Having just lost
my own grandfather.

207
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,076
You did? When?

208
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,746
Forty years ago.

209
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,282
But in my child body,
that's yesterday.

210
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,751
I'm gonna
tell Astrid, okay?

211
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,318
Just give me a few minutes
before you come up.

212
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,020
Enough!
I'll handle this.

213
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,457
Astrid!

214
00:15:58,593 --> 00:15:59,594
Astrid!

215
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:01,629
Astrid!

216
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,033
Stop torturing your mother.

217
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,001
I know I usually find it funny,

218
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,470
and only fair
after the way she treated me

219
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,004
when she was your age.

220
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,406
But not today!

221
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,310
Your mummy's lost her daddy.

222
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,545
You've lost your grandpa.

223
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,481
And I've lost my...

224
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,015
horny handyman.

225
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,184
Charles.

226
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,487
Charles!

227
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:30,090
Oh, Charles!

228
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:35,597
Can't believe Grandpa is dead.

229
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,732
He's like the only semi-normal
person in this family.

230
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,100
We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

231
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,536
What do you mean
for a few weeks?

232
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,036
I thought we were just
going for the funeral.

233
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,438
Well, we need to clear out
the house.

234
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,039
Grandpa loved that place.

235
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,575
Yes, and we are going
to honor him

236
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,611
with a Grief Collective.

237
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,513
A "Grief Collective"?

238
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:57,050
I am seeing a semi-multimedia
visual manifesto of our loss.

239
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,418
What does loss look like?

240
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,321
Is it just tears? A headstone?

241
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,690
Wilting gladioli?

242
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:06,193
No, we need to unpack
the art of sorrow.

243
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:10,063
Yeah, that sounds
really traumatic.

244
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,164
I can't go.

245
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,734
I'm our school rep

246
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,468
for our Student Environmental
Conference next week.

247
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,169
We're presenting our demands
on climate change action.

248
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,540
I spoke with the principal,
and they cleared it.

249
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:20,842
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

250
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,777
Yeah, well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

251
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,612
the principal becomes your
little puppet on a string.

252
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,115
Well, you're free
to reject your inheritance

253
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,250
when you're living high
off a tree hugger's salary.

254
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:36,189
What? No! No!

255
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,394
Jesus! Okay,
people already know

256
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,195
that Lydia Deetz is my mom.

257
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,232
Okay, can you stop being
a freak for, like, one second?

258
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,635
-Go back.
-Why?

259
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,303
All right, people already know
you'd rather spend

260
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,071
more time with ghosts
than your own daughter.

261
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,673
Jesus, Bob.

262
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,474
Can't you see
I'm concentrating here?

263
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,611
You know, Bob,

264
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,212
long distance relationships
can be difficult.

265
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,815
Especially when
one of you is dead

266
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,482
and the other's ignoring you
for 30 years.

267
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:36,818
But Lydia and I,

268
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:38,720
we have a definite
psychic connection.

269
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,354
<i>I just need</i>
<i>these people out of my house.</i>

270
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,256
Please hold! Afterlife
Call Center, please hold.

271
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,492
<i>How much</i>
<i>for a premium bio exorcism?</i>

272
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,828
And I'll tell ya something,

273
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,529
she definitely saw me
that last time.

274
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,398
I felt a little tingle.

275
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,667
<i>The money back</i>
<i>guarantee one.</i>

276
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,602
I'm putting your call
through now.

277
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,203
<i>I've just died,</i>
<i>and she's already remarried.</i>

278
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,839
Sell him the honeymoon package.

279
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,473
I'll kill the new husband,
and I'll possess the ex-wife.

280
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:00,942
I'll make her
do some unseemly things,

281
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,577
and then I'll post the pics.

282
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,878
<i>Can I pay</i>
<i>in installments?</i>

283
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,885
I'm needed upstairs.

284
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,320
Bob, hold down the fort.

285
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,665
<i>Ou je suis?</i>

286
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:24,899
- Where am I?
- Take a number,

287
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,166
take a seat.

288
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,579
I'm more of a dog person.

289
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,915
You! Room 515. Now.

290
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,989
-Come on.
-Come on.

291
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,456
Hey,
easy with the suit.

292
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,490
Don't "Detective" me,

293
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:51,726
you walking disaster.

294
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,326
-We got reports.
-Another protestor.

295
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,629
<i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>

296
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:58,833
Wolf Jackson,
Afterlife Crime Unit.

297
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,201
Let me take a wild stab.

298
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:02,670
Actor.

299
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,972
Not just any actor.

300
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:08,442
I've done it all.
For six movies and a reboot,

301
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,678
I became Frank Hardballer.

302
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,980
Doing my own stunts
was non-negotiable.

303
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:14,882
-You know why?
-Authenticity.

304
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,517
Correct.

305
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,853
A vice cop doesn't
get to a perp's door

306
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:22,422
and then call for some hambone
stunt man to break it down.

307
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,025
Neither did I.

308
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,727
You gotta keep it real.

309
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,427
Looks like you got a little
too real there, bud.

310
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:30,998
Who knew it was a live grenade?

311
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,034
Your name came up

312
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,636
on this case I'm investigating.

313
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,743
Recognize this puss?

314
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,680
Never seen that chick
before in my life.

315
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:46,781
Or afterlife.

316
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,654
Any idea

317
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,523
why my suspect wrote your name

318
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,424
in this schmo's goo?

319
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:01,294
Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,
but could be a super-fan.

320
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,897
You know,
guys like you and me...

321
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,999
...we drive the gals crazy.

322
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,968
She collected
all her body parts.

323
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,437
My hunch
is she's out for revenge.

324
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,775
And you seem to be <i>numero uno</i>
on her hit list.

325
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,009
Well, wouldn't be
the first woman

326
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,476
who wanted to kill me.

327
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,513
And kinda hard
to kill a dead guy.

328
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:19,747
This gal can.

329
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,582
She's a soul sucker.

330
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:23,316
Oh, yeah,
you could say that again.

331
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:27,454
My advice, lay low.

332
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,390
She gets her hands on you
and you're dead-dead.

333
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:33,326
And there's no coming back
from that, Mr. Juice.

334
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,461
Roger that.

335
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:43,037
<i>♪ Day-o, me say day-o ♪</i>

345
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:29,684
I just don't believe
I won't see Charles again.

346
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,152
Be comforted in the knowledge

347
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,654
that he's in
a far better place.

348
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:36,023
Angels are guiding him
towards everlasting light

349
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:38,726
and may his soul fly through
the heavenly gates,

350
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,661
like the birds
that he so adored

351
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,495
and soar over
the Fields of Elysium

352
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,998
to the glory that is thine.

353
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,000
What?

354
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,977
I haven't been to a funeral
since Dad's.

355
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,145
Death is hard.

356
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:01,849
Yeah, sometimes
I think life is harder.

357
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:04,051
I know.

358
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,090
Listen, if you wanna talk
to that therapist again...

359
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:10,124
There you go again.

360
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,693
You just sidestep

361
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:13,861
every possible
conversation about him.

362
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:15,830
Astrid...

363
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:18,465
I loved your father,

364
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,701
but our relationship was over

365
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,570
a long time
before the accident.

366
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,873
I still don't understand
why you can't see him.

367
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:31,712
-Why not?
-I wish I knew.

368
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,081
But this ability

369
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,950
didn't exactly
come with instructions.

370
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,520
It all started
when I was your age.

371
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,188
It's ironic, isn't it?

372
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:42,790
You can apparently
see any random ghost

373
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,191
for your shitty TV show,

374
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,526
but the one ghost
that actually matters to me

375
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,928
you can't see at all.

376
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,749
We are closed!

377
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:11,652
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Charles Deetz.

378
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,754
I'm feeling
a little lightheaded.

379
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:14,989
Where am I?

380
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:16,724
Damn newbies.

381
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,893
You wait! In waiting room!

382
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,896
All right.

383
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,998
Unbelievable.

384
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,542
Hey...

385
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:35,876
who's there?

386
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:34,001
-My ex-wife is back.
-Hmm?

387
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,137
Well, I know
what you're thinking...

388
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,707
"When was the Juice
ever tied down?

389
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,077
What kind of woman could ever
keep him satisfied?" Well...

390
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,085
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

391
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:00,080
Now she's back,

392
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:01,248
and she's pissed.

393
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:32,446
Hey.

394
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,717
Must be pretty
noisy up here. Yeah?

395
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:39,019
In here, too.

396
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:43,424
Listen, if you ever
need to process

397
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,359
any of your emotions,
I'm here for you.

398
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:51,832
Emotions processed. Thanks.

399
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,335
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

400
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,171
He must have been
a pretty dope dude.

401
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,442
Death is so, like...

402
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:06,780
It's, like, tragic,
you know?

403
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:09,950
I mean, if you ever wanna,
you know, cry or just,

404
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,418
kind of rage against
some of these feelings

405
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:13,320
that you have going on
in there,

406
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:14,788
I want you to know

407
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,024
that I could be that...

408
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:20,060
kinda dope dad-dude for you.
You know?

409
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,565
-I'm good.
-You know,

410
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:24,798
times like this
can bring a family

411
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,934
weirdly closer together.

412
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,369
On the way over here,

413
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,104
I wrote a poem
for your grandpa.

414
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:32,339
Oh, did you? How does it go?

415
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,210
It's, it's, it's...

416
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,945
it starts...

417
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:40,582
It, well, it kinda like
opens on grief. Obviously.

418
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:43,384
And then acceptance.

419
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,553
It's long. I didn't memorize it
or anything like that,

420
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:47,288
but it's quite beautiful.

421
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,156
Cut the crap, Rory.

422
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,191
All right? I'm not falling
for your New Age,

423
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,093
overly emotional,
trauma bonding,

424
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:54,428
yoga retreat bullshit.

425
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:56,196
I see you.

426
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,399
Because, like you,

427
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:01,402
my mom is a very broken person.

428
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,203
Okay?
She's a delusional fantasist.

429
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:05,540
You just exploit her.

430
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:06,907
And if she wants
to allow that to happen,

431
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,941
that's on her.

432
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:19,521
I'm so sorry
for your loss. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,122
I know, I know. Thank you.

434
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:25,259
Oh, if it isn't
little Jane Butterfield.

435
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,894
Littler Jane?

436
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:28,228
Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee
now.

437
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:29,496
We hyphenated.

438
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:30,532
Is that Maxie Dean?

439
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,133
No.

440
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,401
No one's here yet.

441
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,506
Sample from
my hubby's microbrewery.

442
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,109
"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

443
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:45,379
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

444
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:47,448
It's a mourning shroud.

445
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:50,417
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

446
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:53,253
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

447
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:56,156
To a new life
with a new family.

448
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,559
I can't wait to show it.

449
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:59,259
Buyers are already lining up.

450
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:00,994
Thanks to you, Lydia,

451
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,197
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

452
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,666
Ghosts aren't real.

453
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,167
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

454
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,636
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

455
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,505
Okay, honey, in we go.

456
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,941
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

457
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:14,975
What?

458
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,377
We're gathered here today

459
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,047
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

460
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,215
Now, I only had the pleasure

461
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:22,916
of meeting Charles a few times.

462
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,185
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

463
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,955
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

464
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,191
Yeah, but he also...

465
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,260
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

466
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,463
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

467
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:38,298
Lydia,

468
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:39,466
now, I know
we had always agreed

469
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,501
to take
our relationship slowly.

470
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,136
But I can't wait any longer.

471
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,139
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

472
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,141
Will you marry me on Halloween?

473
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,375
- Good Lord!
- Uh...

474
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,145
That's... That's in two days!

475
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:52,413
Yes, I know.

476
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,380
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

477
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:54,982
The church is available.

478
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,316
The Lord's sanctuary
welcomes all who seek

479
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,118
salvation
and everlasting glory.

480
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:01,155
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

481
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,490
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

482
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:07,394
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

483
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,698
because as we stand here,

484
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:12,700
surrounded by death...

485
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:15,302
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

486
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,538
Because I want to spend

487
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,639
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

488
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,508
And you, Delia.

489
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,044
And you too.

490
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:25,547
And you. Again.

491
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,381
What do you say?

492
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,317
Rory, I... Come on,

493
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,453
I can't commit to this
right now.

494
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,558
Oh.

495
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,560
All right.

496
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,330
This is too much loss.

497
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:44,599
What do you mean?

498
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,200
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

499
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,669
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

500
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,303
which you know about.
And now the death of...

501
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:53,440
-us.
-No! No, I...

502
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,242
Come on, I didn't mean that.

503
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:56,778
Thought you wanted to take
life's great big bungee jump

504
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,045
right beside me.

505
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,747
No safety nets, right?

506
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,381
But I guess,

507
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:03,350
the only thing
bungee jumping today is love.

508
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:06,053
And that cord just snapped.

509
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:08,021
Come on. Rory...

510
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,123
-I love you.
-And I love you.

511
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,194
Oh.

512
00:33:14,228 --> 00:33:15,429
What are we waiting for?

513
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,066
Okay, I guess.

514
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:23,437
Oh, my God.

515
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:28,710
She said "yes"!

516
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:31,779
She said "yes"!

517
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,716

Sorry!

531
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:51,224
- Sorry!
- Watch out!

532
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:02,637
Whoa.

533
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,641
Are you okay?

534
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:15,850
Are you okay?
What happened?

535
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:18,786
Yeah. I'll live.

536
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,421
Uh, what are you reading?

537
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,391
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

538
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,193
-One of those.
-"One of those"?

539
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,662
What does that mean?

540
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,697
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

541
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:32,232
-Did you really?
-Yeah.

542
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:33,835
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

543
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:34,836
Yes.

544
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,738
Yeah, I...

545
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:40,207
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

546
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,609
Where have you been
all my life?

547
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,482
So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

548
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:49,751
My whole life.

549
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:51,451
I've never seen you
around before.

550
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,253
Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

551
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:54,555
for my grandpa's funeral.

552
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,457
Until my mom's janky fiance

553
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,861
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

554
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,328
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

555
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,332
Wow. That's different.

556
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:06,634
Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

557
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:07,935
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

558
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,171
Is your dad
in the picture or...

559
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,440
No.

560
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,243
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

561
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,913
Defender of hopeless causes.

562
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:21,348
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

563
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:22,717
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

564
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:25,653
But my mom grew up here.

565
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:27,320
That old house on the hill.

566
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:29,624
Wait. The Ghost House?

567
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:32,225
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

568
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:33,961
Unfortunately.

569
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,663
She's a legend.

570
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,699
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

571
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:39,634
You don't?

572
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,904
-No.
-Mmm-hmm.

573
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,639
I only believe in things
that I can see.

574
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,473
You know, science. Facts.

575
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,410
Oh.

576
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,479
Yeah, it's gonna keep going.

577
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:54,849
Back to the insanity.

578
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,250
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

579
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,753
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

580
00:36:58,786 --> 00:37:00,955
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

581
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,694
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

582
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:10,397
if you want a break
from the insanity.

583
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:45,933
Witness confirmed our suspect

584
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,035
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

585
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:49,302
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

586
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,638
Hit me.

587
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:51,706
After she turned the owner

588
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,775
into a human pancake,

589
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:55,643
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

590
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:58,411
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

591
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,747
has her twisted heart set

592
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:03,483
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

593
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:04,952
She won't stop killing,

594
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:07,889
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

595
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:14,327
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

596
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,633
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

597
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:20,568
Thank you, Janet.

598
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:22,937
You keep me real.

599
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,437
Should we take
this Beetlejuice

600
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,706
into protective custody?

601
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,974
See if you can find him.

602
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,576
He's probably laying low.

603
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,678
Scared out of his mind.

604
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,653
A little higher, boys.

605
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,588
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

606
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,396
Bob.

607
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,463
Like lookin' in a mirror.

608
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,035
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

609
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:55,770
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

610
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:59,040
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

611
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,943
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

612
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,790
Now's my chance.

613
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:29,503
What?

614
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,038
Why?

615
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,641
No! No! No!

616
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:35,142
Delia, what's wrong?

617
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,777
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

618
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,579
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

619
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:40,815
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

620
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,683
-Why?
-For the Collective.

621
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,719
We cannot sincerely celebrate

622
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:47,420
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

623
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:49,422
Not until we release the horror

624
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:50,791
that they inflicted upon us.

625
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:53,426
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

626
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,997
He bought this house
without telling me.

627
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,035
Oh, my God!

628
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,870
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

629
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,572
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

630
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,473
It was Delia.

631
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:07,875
Oh, Delia.

632
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,110
I'm good.

633
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,212
Ignore her.

634
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,980
That was very
thoughtful of you.

635
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,149
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

636
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,485
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

637
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,787
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

638
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,589
our grief and our trauma.

639
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:22,823
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

640
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:24,558
and we gotta
finish those shows.

641
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:25,826
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

642
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,528
to give us a hand.

643
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:30,698
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

644
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,465
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

645
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,102
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

646
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,605
How convenient.

647
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,609
Ew.

648
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,025
Oh.

649
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,860
God, I thought I lost those.

650
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:45,900
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

651
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:48,602
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

652
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:50,971
My water broke during
<i>Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>

653
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:53,908
Dad's favorite movie.

654
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:54,975
Yeah.

655
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,010
Can I keep this?

656
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,813
Yeah.

657
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,714
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

658
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,084
Did Grandpa make that?

659
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,986
No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

660
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,622
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

661
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,066
Oh, I found that on the floor.

662
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,269
-Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
-Don't ever say that name!

663
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:23,971
Not ever!

664
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:26,207
-Beetlejuice.
-No! Astrid, I'm serious.

665
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,809
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

666
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:30,177
-is gonna happen.
-Like what?

667
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:32,179
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

668
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,848
Do you understand me?

669
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:35,116
Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

670
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,233
Oh, my God, it's you!

671
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,668
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

672
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:56,904
It's breathing exercises.

673
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,639
Try seeing ghosts every day.

674
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,008
Astrid!

675
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:03,144
Let her be.

676
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,879
God, she hates me.

677
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:09,416
Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

678
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,352
You blamed me
for your mother's.

679
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:13,087
She's not dead.

680
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,123
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

681
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:17,258
There's a difference.

682
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,859
You weren't very nice.

683
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:21,362
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

684
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:23,230
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

685
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:26,300
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

686
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,735
we have gotten closer.

687
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,336
No, I started liking you
before that.

688
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,876
Again with
the creepy breathing!

689
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,711
It works!

690
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:39,813
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

691
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,182
Of course you did.

692
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,150
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

693
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:45,219
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

694
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,121
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

695
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,389
in a skiing accident,

696
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,791
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

697
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,359
and we connected.

698
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:54,195
Yeah.

699
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:56,397
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

700
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,299
Okay, but this isn't about him.

701
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,234
Astrid found this in the attic.

702
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:02,036
Ew. So?

703
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,205
So?

704
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,440
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

705
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:08,008
Like he's lurking somewhere,

706
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,476
just out of reach.

707
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:10,911
But lately,

708
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:12,446
I'm seeing him again.

709
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,949
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

710
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,317
But now this?

711
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,385
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

712
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:21,388
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

713
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:23,023
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

714
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:25,059
who tormented me
all those years ago?

715
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,494
It's time to find her.

716
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:43,244
- Hey.
- Hey.

717
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,285
- Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

718
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:53,454
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

719
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:54,855
Okay. Have fun.

720
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,028
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

721
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,163
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

722
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:16,477
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

723
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:17,579
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

724
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:20,548
No, I troll old record stores.

725
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,483
I don't trust
what I can't touch.

726
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:30,057
<i>Handbook for</i>
<i>the Recently Deceased.</i>

727
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,326
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

728
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,995
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly.

729
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,598
Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

730
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:37,831
my mom would write.

731
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,434
What's the deal
with your parents?

732
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:43,070
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

733
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,839
in the kitchen stress-baking.

734
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,175
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

735
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,877
but then he had an accident,

736
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,880
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

737
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:55,215
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

738
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,853
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

739
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:02,122
traveling, with a famous mom.

740
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:04,058
Not really.

741
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:05,926
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

742
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:06,994
We used to have this big plan

743
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,329
where we were gonna visit

744
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,030
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

745
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:13,267
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

746
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,337
yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

747
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:18,238
What happened?

748
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,442
A boat accident.

749
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,210
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

750
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:24,478
and they never found his body.

751
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:29,283
You really miss him.

752
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:33,020
Yeah.

753
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,355
You know,
I at least would have liked

754
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,123
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

755
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:37,458
But can't your mom,

756
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:39,159
I don't know, like,

757
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,529
contact him or...

758
00:47:41,563 --> 00:47:42,930
She claims
she can't even see him.

759
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:44,932
-Why not?
-Because she's a fraud.

760
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,602
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

761
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,539
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

762
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,908
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

763
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:57,010
Because my dad,
he would go all out

764
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,680
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

765
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:00,481
Yeah, I think I was

766
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,916
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

767
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,587
-Wow. Yeah.
-Yeah. It was a choice.

768
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,087
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

769
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:08,355
so I don't know,

770
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,157
probably be
my least favorite now.

771
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,325
Well, what time's the wedding?

772
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:13,561
Midnight. The witching hour.

773
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:15,429
Future stepdad's lame idea.

774
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,967
Well, why don't you
come over...

775
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,035
earlier?

776
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:25,005
Uh, we could,

777
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:29,009
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

778
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:33,914
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

779
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:35,949
no pressure.

780
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:42,590
What is up
with these creepy birds?

781
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:44,958
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

782
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,994
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

783
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:48,730
you love in SoHo.

784
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:51,231
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.

785
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,000
Should be here later today.

786
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,334
Ooh, great. Thanks.

787
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,505
And a, uh,

788
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,973
little bird may have
chirped our big news

789
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,075
to a few news outlets.

790
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:04,378
Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

791
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,146
Could be great press
for the show.

792
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,750
I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

793
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:12,286
but can we just keep it
small and private?

794
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,622
Yeah. Well, sure.

795
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:15,657
It's your big day.

796
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,559
Night. Whatever.

797
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:21,428
<i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>

798
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:23,197
<i>all through me. All through me!</i>

799
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,003
Lydia?

800
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,675
I want you out of my life!

801
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:34,709
Do you hear me?

802
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:36,443
Lydia?

803
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:40,748
Who are you yelling at?

804
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:43,217
Do you remember that
couples therapist that we saw,

805
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,586
-Dr. Glickman?
-Mmm.

806
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,386
He said that I was holding
something back

807
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,790
and until I faced it,
you and I wouldn't evolve.

808
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:51,425
-Mmm.
-Okay, well, he was right.

809
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,695
And I'm going to tell you now.

810
00:49:53,728 --> 00:49:54,796
And, fair warning,

811
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,565
it's gonna sound batshit crazy.

812
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,100
Are you okay with that?

813
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,502
Of course. I'd love to.

814
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:03,303
Let's break through
this barrier together.

815
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,105
Okay, just give me a sec.

816
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,410
When I was a teenager,

817
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:13,748
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

818
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:15,482
and tried to force me
to marry him,

819
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:18,686
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

820
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,288
I believed he was gone forever,

821
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:23,558
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

822
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:26,293
And now, he is actually back.

823
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:29,731
And I don't know why,
or how, or what to do.

824
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:34,368
Okay, so you're saying that
someone called Beetlejuice...

825
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:35,770
Don't say his name!

826
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:37,705
If you say his name
three times,

827
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,239
he will appear.

828
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,512
Okay. So this...

829
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:47,515
demon is clearly a construct
of your unpacked trauma.

830
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:49,149
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face,

831
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:50,552
otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

832
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:53,655
He's not a construct.
He is literally a demon.

833
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,592
I know this
is a big step for you.

834
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,393
But in the words
of Dr. Glickman,

835
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:01,395
I'm gonna give you
the push you need.

836
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,198
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

837
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,742
What just happened?

838
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,276
We're in the model.

839
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:18,546
That's not possible.

840
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:23,685
What the hell?

841
00:51:23,718 --> 00:51:25,319
I told you not to say his name!

842
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:31,693
<i>Lydia Deetz,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>

843
00:51:31,726 --> 00:51:33,493
<i>Don't ever</i>
<i>say that name.</i>

844
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:36,263
<i>Not ever!</i>
<i>We need to leave, now.</i>

845
00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:38,165
<i>Beetlejuice,</i>
<i>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>

846
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:42,169
-Is that...
-Beetlejuice!

847
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,308
First of all,
I want you two kids to know,

848
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:50,210
this is a safe space. Okay?

849
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:51,613
Feel free
to express yourselves.

850
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:53,615
Don't be afraid. I sense
there's an enabler here,

851
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:54,682
but we'll get to that.

852
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:55,917
Look, dig deep

853
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,217
and spill your guts.

854
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,519
Okay? Who wants to go first?

855
00:51:58,553 --> 00:52:00,153
Huh?

856
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:01,488
All right, I will.

857
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:07,427
There you go. See?
I'm willing to do the work.

858
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,930
You two kids
need to get in touch

859
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:10,598
with your inner child.

860
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:12,265
Mine'll be along
in just a jiffy.

861
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:29,951
Everybody says
he's got my eyes.

862
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:32,820
Personally, I don't see it.

863
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:34,522
Scram, kid.

864
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:38,726
You're just my unpacked trauma.

865
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,360
You're just my unpacked trauma.

866
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:42,329
You're a figment
of my imagination.

867
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,598
Really?

868
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:44,932
Is this a figment
of your imagination?

869
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:52,840
Leg man.

870
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,575
Just like his old man.

871
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:04,619
That was you stalking me.

872
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:05,887
Hey, if stalking means

873
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,622
trying to remarry
the love of my life,

874
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:09,957
well, I'm guilty as charged.
Come here!

875
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,659
Home, home, home!

876
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:30,678
<i>♪ Wherever you go</i>
<i>Whatever you do ♪</i>

877
00:53:30,712 --> 00:53:36,316
<i>♪ I will be right here</i>
<i>Waiting for you ♪</i>

878
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:39,687
What happened?

879
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:41,622
I just had the wildest dream.

880
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:45,492
Yeah, I think
we should lay off the pills.

881
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:55,502
Snakes?

882
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:57,572
Actually, asps.

883
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,006
Aren't they beautiful?

884
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,608
Wedding gift for Rory?

885
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:03,578
Too late.
They've been defanged.

886
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:05,680
Guaranteed harmless,
and they're for me.

887
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:07,749
In Ancient Egypt,

888
00:54:07,782 --> 00:54:09,316
a queen would perform
a ceremony

889
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,318
at the tomb of her pharaoh
using snakes,

890
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,420
the symbol of undying love.

891
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:14,789
-Are you sure about that?
-Mmm-hmm.

892
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,323
We read that
they were a constant threat

893
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:17,390
to Ra in the underworld

894
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,659
and represented total chaos.

895
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:19,861
Okay, see,
that's why schools need

896
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:21,629
more art and less reading.

897
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:23,497
You got your wish,
we're leaving.

898
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:24,599
So go pack up your things,

899
00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:25,767
I'm driving you back to school.

900
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,300
Wait, what happened?

901
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:29,469
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

902
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:31,606
I will pay
for a fleet of movers

903
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,641
to take everything
back to Manhattan,

904
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:34,909
except that model.

905
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,310
We need to chop it up
and burn it.

906
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:38,679
Oh.

907
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:40,748
You're calling off the wedding?

908
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:45,887
What did that
cheese ball do now?

909
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,354
It's not Rory.

910
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,421
It's Beetlejuice.

911
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,557
He's here.

912
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,025
In the model. I saw him.

913
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:53,393
Rory saw him, too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

914
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:54,662
Wait,
we can't leave yet.

915
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,432
I have plans tomorrow
with this boy that I met.

916
00:55:01,636 --> 00:55:03,638
How did you have time
to meet a boy?

917
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:05,072
You had time to get married.

918
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:07,775
She doesn't
mean it. It's just karma.

919
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,043
Whatever. I was biking

920
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:10,878
and then I kinda crashed
into his fence

921
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,713
and we started talking,

922
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:13,781
and then he invited me over
to his place for Halloween.

923
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:17,585
Can I go, Mom?

924
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,986
Mmm-mmm.

925
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,021
Please?

926
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,827
I will not allow
that menace to humanity

927
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,862
to upheave our family again.

928
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:31,132
No one goes in there,
no one calls his name!

929
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:33,034
We're gonna be fine, right?

930
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:35,636
Mom, come on!
I'm gonna be late.

931
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:50,117
Trick or treat!

932
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,957
Are you sure
this is the right address?

933
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,692
Yeah.

934
00:55:57,725 --> 00:55:59,560
125 Jefferson Lane.

935
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:01,428
Don't judge... all right?

936
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:02,897
His dad just got
into an accident at work,

937
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,431
and they're going through
a rough patch.

938
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:05,700
Trick or treat!

939
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:06,734
He's cute.

940
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,436
What are you doing?

941
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:10,771
I was gonna go
say "hey" to his parents.

942
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:12,740
Seriously?
This isn't a playdate.

943
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:13,808
I mean,
we're not six years old.

944
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:14,876
Nothing's gonna happen.

945
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:17,044
All right, okay. You're right.

946
00:56:17,078 --> 00:56:20,147
Have fun,
and I'll pick you up at 10:00.

947
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:21,616
Not a second later.

948
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:26,654
Come on, quick!

949
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,358
Trick or treat!

950
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:51,078
I, uh,
raided the basement.

951
00:56:51,112 --> 00:56:53,514
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

952
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:54,715
Yeah, you really went all out.

953
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,584
Yeah.

954
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,586
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

955
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:59,687
Thank you. But yeah,

956
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,222
my parents think
I look more like

957
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,057
Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>

958
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,059
-Mmm?
-Your costume looks great.

959
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:07,895
Who are you supposed to be?

960
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:08,963
Marie Curie.

961
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:12,800
Two-time Nobel Prize-winning
French physicist

962
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,602
-and feminist icon.
-Oh, she was, uh,

963
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:16,871
she discovered radiation.
Right?

964
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:18,105
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

965
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,173
Yeah, her work was killing her.

966
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,608
She didn't even realize it.

967
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:22,710
Yeah, well,
for someone who is dying

968
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,879
of radiation poisoning,

969
00:57:24,912 --> 00:57:28,549
uh, you look beautiful.

970
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:32,019
I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

971
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,587
It's probably
too much actually.

972
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:35,122
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

973
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:37,124
maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

974
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:39,193
Or we could start
handing it out now,

975
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:40,828
if that's...

976
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:42,563
-what you wanna do.
-Yeah.

977
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:45,099
Uh, I have a confession,
actually.

978
00:57:46,701 --> 00:57:49,704
I'd rather stay up here
with you.

979
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:55,109
Okay. Yeah.

980
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,044
That works, too.

981
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:31,679
Please don't freak out.

982
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:32,713
What are you?

983
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:34,682
Don't you know?

984
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:38,786
Astrid, really,
you don't have to be scared.

985
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:41,956
You're a ghost.

986
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:47,762
My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

987
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:49,230
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

988
00:58:49,263 --> 00:58:51,032
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

989
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:53,067
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

990
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,101
And one day,

991
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:56,771
I slipped

992
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:57,805
and fell.

993
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,307
How long ago did that happen?

994
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:02,743
23 years, 5 months and 14 days.

995
00:59:02,777 --> 00:59:04,178
But who's counting?

996
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,713
I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

997
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,649
I can't go any further
than that tree.

998
00:59:08,682 --> 00:59:11,819
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

999
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,320
But then you came along,

1000
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:14,722
and you could see me.

1001
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:18,259
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1002
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,628
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1003
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:21,729
It was amazing.

1004
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:23,664
You're amazing.

1005
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:25,266
-I should go.
-Astrid, I know.

1006
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:26,767
I know it's insane.

1007
00:59:26,801 --> 00:59:29,970
But I really like you,

1008
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:31,739
and I want us to be together.

1009
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,775
How?

1010
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:37,011
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1011
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:39,680
Well, uh,

1012
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:41,348
what if I told you

1013
00:59:41,382 --> 00:59:43,117
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1014
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:46,187
To be human again.

1015
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,289
Um, it's all in this book.

1016
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:50,191
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1017
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:51,625
It's kind of complicated,

1018
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:53,861
but, uh, I can only do it

1019
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:57,698
with the help
of a living person.

1020
00:59:57,731 --> 01:00:00,734
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1021
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:03,270
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

1022
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:05,906
'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

1023
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,341
Yeah, well, I...

1024
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:09,977
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1025
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,345
to stay away.

1026
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:13,180
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1027
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:17,351
You'd get to see your dad.

1028
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,286
Again.

1029
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,736
I have the first
official open house

1030
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,138
a week from Sunday,

1031
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:39,006
and then we will let
the bidding war begin.

1032
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,274
Where's Rory?

1033
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:42,009
Supermarket.

1034
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:44,044
Swapping out the candy
I bought for carrot sticks.

1035
01:00:44,078 --> 01:00:46,347
Because Rory loves
to fun-suck everything.

1036
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,781
Even Halloween.

1037
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:50,317
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1038
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:53,154
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1039
01:00:53,187 --> 01:00:54,188
No, Delia.

1040
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:56,190
Where are you going?

1041
01:00:56,223 --> 01:00:57,791
Cemetery.

1042
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:59,827
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1043
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:03,864
I need to skedaddle, too.

1044
01:01:03,898 --> 01:01:05,432
I'm co-chaperoning

1045
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:08,135
Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1046
01:01:08,169 --> 01:01:10,404
We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1047
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:13,440
We agreed nothing Disney.

1048
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:15,309
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1049
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:19,246
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

1050
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,115
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

1051
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:23,484
- Mmm?
- Fruit salad.

1052
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:25,052
Isn't that genius?

1053
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:26,987
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1054
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:28,889
I'm going as...

1055
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:33,394
"reverse mortgage."

1056
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:35,329
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

1057
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:38,132
Where is Astrid?

1058
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:40,501
On a date. Her first.

1059
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:43,070
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

1060
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:44,805
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1061
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,941
Don't mention that street.

1062
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:48,008
I have a listing that's kept me

1063
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,144
from a perfect sales record.

1064
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:52,046
Oh, it's my own fault.

1065
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,415
The place had been
on the market for years...

1066
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:57,017
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1067
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:58,419
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1068
01:01:58,452 --> 01:01:59,753
Murder House?

1069
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,288
Which house?

1070
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,225
125.

1071
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:06,026
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1072
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,795
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1073
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:10,864
Jeremy Frazier?

1074
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,900
I didn't get his last name.

1075
01:02:13,968 --> 01:02:15,769
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1076
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:18,906
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1077
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:22,243
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1078
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:24,245
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1079
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:25,312
When they tried to get him out,

1080
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:27,314
he fell, broke his neck,

1081
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:29,083
died instantly.

1082
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:37,024
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

1083
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:39,226
Draw a door with some chalk?

1084
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,528
Oh, and knock three times?

1085
01:02:40,562 --> 01:02:42,029
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

1086
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:43,063
So lame.

1087
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:55,843
Or maybe it's not so lame.

1088
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:57,579
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

1089
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:59,514
I can. But since
you're still alive,

1090
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,882
you have to read
that incantation first.

1091
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:07,888
<i>"De mundo</i>
<i>vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>

1092
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:25,507
Astrid!

1093
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:33,213
Jeremy, is that you?

1094
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:42,056
<i>"Ut liber iterum</i>
<i>ambulet alius."</i>

1095
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,958
Okay.

1096
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,427
I think that worked.

1097
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:48,262
Astrid!

1098
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:52,833
Let's go see your dad.

1099
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,072
Astrid! No!

1100
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:05,412
Okay.

1101
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:18,526
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

1102
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,961
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

1103
01:04:20,994 --> 01:04:23,397
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

1104
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,466
Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

1105
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,335
Merry Christmas.

1106
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,571
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,473
Thanks.

1108
01:04:32,507 --> 01:04:34,141
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

1109
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:44,218
Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

1110
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:47,287
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

1111
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:49,423
That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

1112
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,197
Whoa, dude.

1113
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:04,171
Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

1114
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:08,275
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

1115
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:10,512
No, I haven't.

1116
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,547
And I won't ever.

1117
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,582
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

1118
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:18,252
Oh. Oh, that's good.

1119
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:22,055
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

1120
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,625
Kings of Commerce,

1121
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:25,192
Knights of Nasdaq,

1122
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:29,463
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

1123
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:32,099
You are no more, my king.

1124
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:34,268
But with the blessing
of the angels

1125
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,003
of undying love...

1126
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:39,607
I, your surviving queen,

1127
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:42,009
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

1128
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:49,349
Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

1129
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:52,620
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

1130
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:54,188
Just pre-wedding jitters.

1131
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:56,089
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

1132
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,625
but don't come up

1133
01:05:57,659 --> 01:05:59,293
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

1134
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:00,327
Sure.

1135
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:05,132
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

1136
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:07,100
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

1137
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:08,435
Here we are.

1138
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:10,003
- Apples...
- Thank you!

1139
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:12,005
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

1140
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:13,474
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

1141
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:18,979
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1142
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,517
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

1143
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:54,214
The Juice is loose.

1144
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:57,752
I need you to tell me
what this means.

1145
01:06:57,785 --> 01:07:00,688
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

1146
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:03,223
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

1147
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:05,292
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

1148
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,728
He gets to come back,

1149
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,428
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

1150
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:10,330
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

1151
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,599
-Soul Train?
-That's right.

1152
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:14,201
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

1153
01:07:14,234 --> 01:07:15,737
No, she can't
get on that train.

1154
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,539
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

1155
01:07:17,572 --> 01:07:19,139
Well, I can get you in,

1156
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:21,308
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

1157
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,477
Of course there is.
What do you want?

1158
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:25,345
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

1159
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,582
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

1160
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,316
She's kinda clingy.

1161
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,417
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

1162
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:31,819
You want me to marry you!

1163
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:33,487
I thought you'd never ask.

1164
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:35,322
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

1165
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,190
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

1166
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:38,458
Yikes!

1167
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:42,162
Okay, fine.

1168
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:44,197
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

1169
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:45,432
I'm gonna need that in writing.

1170
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:47,134
-Give me that.
-Ow.

1171
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:48,168
And here we go.

1172
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:52,574
I'm gonna make you so happy.

1173
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:55,309
Jesus! What's the plan
on getting in?

1174
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:02,717
Yeah.

1175
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,354
Well, can't exactly
go through the front door.

1176

What if a mistake's been made?

1231
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:08,936
Because I'm not
supposed to be here.

1232

01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,179
There.

1293
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:17,618
By the way, I saw Dad.

1294
01:15:28,696 --> 01:15:30,064
Hey, where are we?

1295
01:15:30,097 --> 01:15:31,165
I don't know.

1296
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:35,936
Hey, that's Saturn.

1297
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,973
Right? So we must be
on one of its moons.

1298
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:40,741
I swear,
the Afterlife is so random!

1299
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,832
Sandworm! Run!

1300
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:14,608
Take my hand!

1301
01:16:21,048 --> 01:16:22,183
Here! Come on!

1302
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:53,314
Marie Curie.

1303
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:55,416
After the radiation poisoning.

1304
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:57,051
Right?

1305
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:58,252
Learned from the best.

1306
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:01,021
We made a great kid.

1307
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:03,924
Yeah, we did.

1308
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:06,660
Come here!

1309
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,265
I know you can't see me,

1310
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:14,201
but I check in on you both
all the time.

1311
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:15,369
And I don't want
to be the reason

1312
01:17:15,402 --> 01:17:17,238
that drove you two apart.

1313
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:18,272
You need each other.

1314
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:21,008
You make each other better.

1315
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:23,043
Always have.

1316
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:25,880
<i>Alert!</i>

1317
01:17:25,913 --> 01:17:27,114
<i>We have a 6-9-9 violation.</i>

1318
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:29,049
We gotta get back
to Winter River.

1319
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,951
You can't leave until
Astrid gets her life back.

1320
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,420
<i>-Warning! Intruder detected!</i>
-Let's go.

1321
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:38,325
The Ghoul patrol found
the breach and sealed it.

1322
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:41,462
Any sign of Mr. Beetlejuice?
Or the Fleshbag?

1323
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:42,930
Still looking.

1324
01:17:42,963 --> 01:17:44,832
But we did find something
that might help.

1325
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:58,946
Hmm.

1326
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:08,989
-"Bob"?
-Mmm?

1327
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,761
Let me tell ya
how this is gonna go.

1328
01:18:13,794 --> 01:18:16,797
Your shriveled lips
will start flappin',

1329
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,966
or I'll crack
your itty-bitty skull

1330
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,968
like a goddamn walnut.

1331
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:22,236
Where's Beetlejuice?

1332
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:38,953
- Rory?
- Father...

1333
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:41,055
I'm seeing these shrunken
head people everywhere.

1334
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:42,756
Well, be not afraid,

1335
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,858
for thine eyes
will see strange things.

1336
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:46,760
Are you filled
with fear and trembling?

1337
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:49,230
Yes! I'm shitting my pants.

1338
01:18:49,263 --> 01:18:51,298
-Ah.
-What are you doing here?

1339
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:52,466
I'm searching
for the lost lambs

1340
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:54,068
to bring back into the light.

1341
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:56,370
Why don't I give you a ride
to the church?

1342
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:04,878
Trick or treat!

1343
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,015
Sorry, sorry I just... I'll...

1344
01:19:08,048 --> 01:19:09,383
I... Come right back, I just...

1345
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:11,185
Excuse me. Just...

1346
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:14,355
Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,
late for a wedding.

1347
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,991
Hi, yes, one question,
how do I get out of here?

1348
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:18,425
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

1349
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:20,961
I'm on a break.
Take a number. Take a seat.

1350
01:19:20,995 --> 01:19:22,363
No, you see, those asps,

1351
01:19:22,396 --> 01:19:23,864
they were defanged.
I paid extra for that.

1352
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:25,966
Honey, you're dead, okay?

1353
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,935
Now take a number and sit down.

1354
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:35,876
Is there perhaps anyone here
who has the power to help me?

1355
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,311
Did that line
used to work for you?

1356
01:19:37,344 --> 01:19:39,280
I'm not dead!

1357
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:42,249
You know what?

1358
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:44,018
My husband's here.
Charles Deetz.

1359
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,553
Yes, he can fix this.

1360
01:19:45,587 --> 01:19:46,954
You call him, he can fix this,
he can fix anything.

1361
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:48,455
Not anymore he can't.

1362
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:51,091
No, wait! Wait, I know people!

1363
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:54,461
Oh! I know people!
I am people! Why's...

1364
01:19:56,263 --> 01:19:57,898
No.

1365
01:19:57,931 --> 01:19:59,833
Beetlejuice. Oh, no.

1366
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:04,405
Beetlejuice.

1367
01:20:06,307 --> 01:20:07,975
Right here.

1368
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:09,877
I get it. Now that you're dead,

1369
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,445
you wanna hang out with me.

1370
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,213
Would you help me
find Charles, please?

1371
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:15,182
And then the VIP lounge.

1372
01:20:15,215 --> 01:20:16,618
-Sure.
-Okay.

1373
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:19,320
Just after you help me
find my runaway bride.

1374
01:20:21,355 --> 01:20:22,489
Ugh.

1375
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,168
Hmm?

1376
01:20:35,537 --> 01:20:37,905
Where is he?

1377
01:20:40,441 --> 01:20:42,376
Tell me.

1378
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,310
<i>Stay behind</i>
<i>the line until called.</i>

1379
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,218
Don't stamp that passport!

1380
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:31,091
You're too late, man.

1381
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,627
I think it was Dostoevsky
who said...

1382
01:21:34,461 --> 01:21:35,462
"Later, fucker!"

1383
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:40,367
This way. Follow me.

1384
01:21:45,139 --> 01:21:47,307
Next!

1385
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:50,177
<i>Warning! Intruder detected.</i>

1386
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:52,980
This way.

1387
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:55,315
<i>This is</i>
<i>a code 6-9-9. We have...</i>

1388
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:56,984
Okay, this is as far as I go.

1389
01:21:57,985 --> 01:21:59,521
-Okay.
-I love you.

1390
01:21:59,554 --> 01:22:01,021
I love you too, sweetheart.

1391
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:04,291
Have an amazing life.

1392
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:05,492
You take care of each other.

1393
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:06,960
Yeah.

1394
01:22:06,994 --> 01:22:08,295
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

1395
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:31,952
Thank you for saving my life.

1396
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:38,192
I'm so sorry I never believed
that you saw ghosts and...

1397
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:39,928
I don't know,
I'm just sorry for all of it.

1398
01:22:42,496 --> 01:22:43,997
Astrid, I...

1399
01:22:44,031 --> 01:22:45,767
Lydia!
Come on, you're late!

1400
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,501
Oh, my God! My wedding!

1401
01:22:47,535 --> 01:22:49,169
We're about to start.

1402
01:22:49,203 --> 01:22:50,738
Wait, Mom, with everything
that's happened tonight,

1403
01:22:50,772 --> 01:22:52,239
you know you don't
have to do this, right?

1404
01:22:52,272 --> 01:22:54,041
I know,
but if I don't do it now,

1405
01:22:54,074 --> 01:22:56,143
I'm never gonna do it.

1406
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:58,145
But are you sure about this?

1407
01:22:58,178 --> 01:23:01,616
Rory loves me,
and that's gotta be enough.

1408
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:03,518
Quickly, my dear!
Come! Come!

1409
01:23:03,551 --> 01:23:04,652
Oh.

1410
01:23:07,622 --> 01:23:08,756
And the lost lamb
is welcome into thy house

1411
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,625
-with open arms.
-Oh, my God!

1412
01:23:12,594 --> 01:23:14,027
I thought you got cold feet.

1413
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,362
Oh, no, blame me.

1414
01:23:15,395 --> 01:23:17,130
She just saved me
from my date from hell.

1415
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,398
Who are all these people?

1416
01:23:18,432 --> 01:23:20,434
This is just
a couple influencers.

1417
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:22,169
Nobody under
five million followers,

1418
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:24,506
and I think we have
a Netflix executive in there.

1419
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:25,673
We doing this?

1420
01:23:25,707 --> 01:23:27,575
Yeah. Where's your dress?

1421
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:29,176
All that matters
is that I'm here, now.

1422
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:30,712
So let's just skip
straight to the vows.

1423
01:23:30,745 --> 01:23:32,145
Wait, where's Delia?

1424
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,280
Yo!

1425
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:35,717
Right here.

1426
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,351
She was helpin' me calm down
before the wedding.

1427
01:23:37,384 --> 01:23:38,786
I was feeling a little jittery.

1428
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,088
-All, right, beat it.
-You.

1429
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:43,558
You're that thing...

1430
01:23:43,591 --> 01:23:45,225
from my dream.

1431
01:23:45,259 --> 01:23:47,160
Well, I'm really
more nightmare material,

1432
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:48,596
but, thanks.

1433
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,364
- You're...
- Uh-uh.

1434
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:52,499
Part of the deal

1435
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,134
is you can never,
ever say my name, ever!

1436
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,502
What deal?

1437
01:23:55,537 --> 01:23:56,771
The deal she made to save you.

1438
01:23:56,804 --> 01:23:58,238
By the way,
you can call me "Dad."

1439
01:23:58,272 --> 01:23:59,607
Lydia.

1440
01:23:59,641 --> 01:24:01,676
You agreed to marry him?

1441
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:05,112
I was desperate,
and it was my only option.

1442
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:06,446
Lydia. What's going on here?

1443
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:09,684
Wow.

1444
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:11,619
Awkward.

1445
01:24:11,653 --> 01:24:13,655
You haven't made much progress
since our last session,

1446
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:16,390
so I'm gonna suggest
some drug therapy.

1447
01:24:16,423 --> 01:24:18,760
Don't be afraid to share.
When you're ready.

1448
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:27,334
I always thought
your whole act was bullshit.

1449
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:29,704
I never believed in ghosts,
spirits, or any of it.

1450
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:31,873
What? All this time?

1451
01:24:31,906 --> 01:24:34,207
Why the hell
did you wanna get married?

1452
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,510
Money!

1453
01:24:35,543 --> 01:24:36,744
I knew I could make more
as your husband

1454
01:24:36,778 --> 01:24:38,345
than I could as your manager.

1455
01:24:38,378 --> 01:24:41,481
And I never
had a dead fiancee.

1456
01:24:41,516 --> 01:24:43,250
I just went
to that survivor's retreat,

1457
01:24:43,283 --> 01:24:46,119
so that I could meet
weak women and exploit them!

1458
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:49,289
And I hit the codependent
lottery when I met you.

1459
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:51,091
How 'bout a little
physical therapy?

1460
01:24:59,299 --> 01:25:00,635
We'd like to thank you all

1461
01:25:00,668 --> 01:25:02,570
for coming to this
very special occasion,

1462
01:25:02,604 --> 01:25:05,205
but right now
we'd like a little privacy.

1463
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:33,233
Where you goin', <i>Padre?</i>

1464
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:44,512
Honey, I've got
one more surprise,

1465
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:45,580
and this one's from the heart.

Mr. Juice,

1506
01:30:07,642 --> 01:30:09,744
you've violated code 6-9-9!

1507
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:11,078
Freeze!

1508
01:30:12,747 --> 01:30:13,848
Book 'em, Danno!

1509
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,551
Beetlejuice!

1510
01:30:20,922 --> 01:30:23,057
What the...

1511
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,525
I'm back.

1512
01:30:29,496 --> 01:30:30,898
Sweetheart!

1513
01:30:30,932 --> 01:30:32,199
You look fantastic!

1514
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:34,068
You look so...

1515
01:30:34,101 --> 01:30:36,637
- put together.
- He's mine.

1516
01:30:36,671 --> 01:30:38,873
It's me, not you.
You know, honey,

1517
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:41,575
I've been goin' through
a lotta changes lately.

1518
01:30:41,609 --> 01:30:43,476
Kind of a mid-afterlife
crisis, I guess.

1519
01:30:43,511 --> 01:30:46,681
Your soul belongs to me,
my love.

1520
01:30:46,714 --> 01:30:48,549
For eternity.

1521
01:30:48,582 --> 01:30:49,850
You don't wanna
spend your eternity with me.

1522
01:30:49,884 --> 01:30:51,018
I'm a lone wolf.

1523
01:30:51,052 --> 01:30:52,653
You need a soulmate.

1524
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:55,488
Somebody who really sees you.
For instance.

1525
01:31:01,662 --> 01:31:03,931
I need something
to draw with. Quick!

1526
01:31:37,932 --> 01:31:39,066
<i>Olé.</i>

1527
01:31:51,112 --> 01:31:52,646
- Let's go!
- Hey!

1528
01:31:53,581 --> 01:31:55,216
We had a deal.

1529
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:56,917
She doesn't have to marry you.

1530
01:31:56,951 --> 01:31:58,919
- What?
-  -You violated code 6-9-9.

1531
01:31:58,953 --> 01:32:01,622
Yeah, you illegally brought
my mom into the Afterlife.

1532
01:32:01,655 --> 01:32:03,924
According to that book,
that contract is null and void.

1533
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:10,097
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out between us,

1534
01:32:10,131 --> 01:32:12,333
but the 600-year age gap

1535
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:14,135
was a little bit much for me.

1536
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:15,669
-Beetle...
-Ah!

1537
01:32:15,703 --> 01:32:17,071
Beetlejuice.

1538
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:22,843
Beetlejuice.

1539
01:32:30,251 --> 01:32:31,952
- Hey!
- Beetlejuice.

1540
01:32:42,263 --> 01:32:43,964
Shoulda got married in Vegas.

1541
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:53,908
Looks like
we're a little late, boys.

1542
01:32:55,976 --> 01:32:58,112
Tape off the crime scene,
call in forensics,

1543
01:32:58,145 --> 01:33:00,948
and keep
the goddamn media away.

1544
01:33:00,981 --> 01:33:04,151
Little lady, you just
popped his Beetlejuice.

1545
01:33:04,185 --> 01:33:05,686
Say your goodbyes,

1546
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:07,655
you can take a selfie now,
if you like,

1547
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:08,889
but make it quick.

1548
01:33:10,724 --> 01:33:12,359
Sister, you're comin' with me.

1549
01:33:12,393 --> 01:33:14,295
What? Delia, what did you do?

1550
01:33:14,328 --> 01:33:15,896
I fell for a scam,

1551
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:18,799
and I'm counting on you
to claim a refund.

1552
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:20,367
Those snakes were actually
poisonous, weren't they?

1553
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:23,838
Yeah. So, I died
of embarrassment.

1554
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:26,006
Your work's gonna
go up in value.

1555
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,708
- Oh! Oh, well, then.
- Mmm-hmm.

1556
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:29,910
Delia...

1557
01:33:29,944 --> 01:33:31,645
-I'll miss you.
-No, you won't.

1558
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,681
I'll find Charles
and we'll haunt you both,

1559
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:35,716
until you beg us to move on!

1560
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:37,785
Nice work
for a couple of Fleshbags.

1561
01:33:37,818 --> 01:33:39,720
Don't come knockin'
until it's your time,

1562
01:33:39,753 --> 01:33:41,422
and in the meantime, remember,

1563
01:33:41,455 --> 01:33:43,290
you gotta keep it real.

1564
01:33:43,324 --> 01:33:44,792
Come on, beautiful,

1565
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:46,794
we got a date
with the commissioner.

1566
01:34:32,473 --> 01:34:33,741
Charles!

1567
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:36,677
Delia!

1568
01:34:38,979 --> 01:34:40,247
I can't believe you're here!

1569
01:34:43,217 --> 01:34:44,485
Oh, Charles.

1570
01:34:44,519 --> 01:34:46,287
I'm so happy
to see you!

1571
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:48,489
Oh, Charles,

1572
01:34:48,523 --> 01:34:49,924
look what happened to me!

1573
01:34:52,459 --> 01:34:54,795
This is the 10:13,

1574

01:35:23,057 --> 01:35:25,125
it's time I started living.
