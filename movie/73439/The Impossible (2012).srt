00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,500
Oh, God!

5
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,958
Did you....

6
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:19,500
- ...Did you set the alarm before we left?
- Yes, the last thing I did!

7
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,958
No, I was the last one to leave.

8
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,375
I was the last one to leave
and I'm sure I didn't set it.

9
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,333
No darling, I was the last one out...

10
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,250
and I did, I promise.

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,458
- Are you sure?
- Yep!

12
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,042
Okay!

13
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,917
No, no, I was the last one
'cause I went back in.

14
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,542
And that means the alarm is not set.

15
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,792
Cause I didn't set it.

16
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,917
Well, I guess that means that we be coming
home to a large bunch of hippies...

17
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,333
...sleeping in our bed.

18
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,917
Well, just like your old college days.

19
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,958

What are you doing? It's time to sit down,
we are about to land, darling.

24
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,667
Lucas won't talk to me.

27
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,500
Take my seat.

28
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:23,083
- What did I do? I didn't do anything.
- You're all right, just sit down and stop worrying.

29
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,833
Buckle up!

30
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,083
Sit down please, madam!

31
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,958
Lucas.

32
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,917
- Lucas.
- What?!

33
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,417
You know you could try being a bit nicer to
your brother, he's just scared.

34
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,375
- So what else is new, everything scares him?
- Buckle!

35
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,333
I wonder who he takes off, though.

38
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,667
Have you been to Kalka before?

39
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,250
No, it's our first time.

40
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,708
This is the best holiday season ever.

41
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,958
The Holidays starts to full,
but this area, it's really quiet.

42
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,083
Great for families.

- All right.

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,667
I'm sorry, but we made a booking
on the third floor, the sea view room.

46
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,958
I know. We are sorry,
that was a mistake.

- Japan.

You don't look Japanese.

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,208
No, well, I work for a big company there,
and we moved around a lot, you know.

52
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,792

53

Not practicing right now.
Just taking care of the kids.

- Mom!
- Yes.

58
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,917
- Can I have one of these, please?
- Lucas, if you are thirsty, would you just...

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,792
- Use your bottled water.
- Exactly.

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,917
- Is it?
- Is it? It is going up.

73
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,958
It's going a different way than the others.

It's going up directly.

81
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,125
Please help!

82
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,542
- It's Christmas morning.
- Help! Need some help, please!

83
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,375
I go to my gift place in this way.

84

- No, no, no.

00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,458
Oh!

87
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,833
Oh, a telescope.

88
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,542
A set complete and over stars
in that you can stick on the ceiling.

89
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,250
- The whole moves away.
- I arrange it on top.

90
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,000
- Oh, look!
- Oh, pool scarf!

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,667
I love it!

92
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,542
Thank you darling.
I mean Santa Claus.

93
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,417
What about you man?
A ball!

94
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,833
Oh, yeah!

95
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,708
Goal!

96
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,250
I can't get sleep.

97
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,667
- Tomorrow I get lost!
- Yeah. Sure.

98
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,750
Can we go outside and watch the stars?

99
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,125
We'll get tomorrow.

100
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,042
Just close your eyes and
think of something nice.

101
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,250
Mom, would you go play ball with me?

102
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,583
In a minute, darling, play with Lucas.

103
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,833
- I can't believe you, the post list!
- What?

104
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,042
I hide that thing and I forget
where I put it.

105
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:21,542
I am on it just to check in to see if there
is a message filled later on in Japan.

106
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,167
Liar.

107
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,167
There should be about text
saying that O'Neil should...

108
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,583
have been given us two years of extension
on this contract.

109
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,417
Which means the two of us are
doing the same job.

110
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:40,250
- That can only really mean one thing.
- They can't fire you.

111
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,417
That would be too expensive.
Don't worry!

112
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,542
Well, I do worry. Because we can't
afford to lose this job, can we?

113
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,292
I can go back to work.

114
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,042
- Maybe it's time.
- In Japan?

115
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,417
No.

116
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,125
Oh, you want to go home?

117
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,708
It's not the worst idea, is it?

118
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,875
Well, you should think about it. But I'm
going to play with the boys now, so...

119
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,875
Here, Dad!

120
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,458
It can't be over ward.

121
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,000
Awful, in our pool.

122
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,208
Catch it!

123
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,833
Oh, no!

124
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,875

Get me out of danger!

136
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,042

Mama, were you all right?

146

Mom! Dad!

165
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,208
Help!

166
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,958
Mom, Mom.

167
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,750
Mom! Mom! Mom!

168
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,208
Mom!

169
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,083
Mom!

170
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,500
Stop, Mom! Stop!

171
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,833
Please.

172
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,833
Never do that to me again, Mom.

173
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:49,500
- Mom! Never do that to me again, Mom.
- I'm here.

174
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,042
Perhaps you can be over there.

175
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:05,125
- Come on! Come up that tree, that tree over there.
- Yes, yes.

176
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,083
That is perfect. That is perfect.

177
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:15,500
Oh, look, please! Please, don't!
Don't move!

178
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,750
Stay very still.

179
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,042
I was a brave kid mom,...
but I was scared.

180
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm scared, too.

181
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,125
Where is everybody?

182
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,792
I don't know, dear!
I don't know.

183
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,375
Mom.

184
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,625
What?

185
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,625
You're bleeding, Mom.

186
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,083
Oh, my God!
Oh!

187
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,375
It's okay.

188
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,542
- I can't see you like this.
- It's okay.

189
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,667
I'm...
Is it?

190
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,375
You go first.

191
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,500
The tree there, the big one.

192
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,833
You think we can climb it?

193
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,292
Okay, let's go.

194
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,250
<i>Dad!</i>

195
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,167
<i>Dad!</i>

196
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:28,583
Wait!
Did you hear that?

197
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,583
- Mom, there's nothing we can do.
- Wait!

198
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,833
We are almost there.
We have to get the safety.

199
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,125
No, we have to help that poor-

200
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:38,250
Mom, if another wave catches us
down here, we will die.

201
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:41,083
We have to climb
that tree right now.

202
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,833
Come on.

203
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,583
- Where are you?
- Mom, look at you, we need help!

204
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,875
We cannot risk it.

205
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,375
We can't risk it mom. Come on.

206
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,250
Listen.

207
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,833
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?

208
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,000
What if they needed help?

209
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,875
- You want someone to help them, wouldn't you?
- Simon and Thomas are dead!

210
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,250
Even it's the last thing we do.

211
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,667
Where are you?

212
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:40,958
<i>Dad!</i>

213
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,000
Look there, Mama, I see.

214
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:03,000
Are you okay?

215
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,833
Okay, okay.

216
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,875
What's your name?

217
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm Lucas, what's your name?

218
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,250
- Daniel.
- Okay, Daniel.

219
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,708
To be up here, we gonna get you out, okay?

220
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,417
Lift him.

221
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,250
It's all right. It's all right.

222
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,167
Are you okay?

223
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,583
OK!

224
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,000
Are you okay?

225
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,958
It’s okay, honey!
Come on!

226
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:20,292
Just stay here, I'll be back.

227
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:31,458
- Mom, I'm coming down, give me a second.
- No, I can do it.

228
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:34,542
- Mom, I'm coming down.
- I can do it, Lucas!

229
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,583
Just stay there, please.

230
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,833
Mom. Mom.

231
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:33,292
Thank you.
Thank!

232
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,875
Did you hear that?

233
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,375
Mama, look. They are coming for us.

234
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,958
Hey, over here!

235
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,583
Hey!

236
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Climb down, Lucas.

237
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,042
Oh, look!

238
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,292
Oh, no!

239
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,208
No, no, no!

240
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,208
Wait!

241
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:23,083
- Lucas?
- Mom, I'm here.

242
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,208
Thanks!

243
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:06,208
Thank you. Thank you.

244
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,125
Thank you so much.

245
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,917
Oh!

246
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,500
My boy!

247
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:23,208
I cannot see them, my boys.

248
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,458
My boys.

249
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,208
Lucas!

250
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,667
Lucas!

251
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,375
Do not let them take me
anywhere without you.

252
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:08,042
Don't worry Mom.
I will not leave you alone. I promise.

253
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,417
All right!

254
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,208
Where is Daniel? What about Daniel?

255
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:19,625
Daniel?

256
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,542
Lucas, where is Daniel?

257
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,542
I don't know.

258
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,000
Thanks!

259
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,250
Thank you!

260
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:00,542
- It's very cold in here.
- It's not cold, Mom.

261
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,292
Mom.

262
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,917
Mom, what's wrong?

263
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,833
I need some antibiotics.
Look in the cupboard.

264
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,958
I can't read the labels.
They're all in Thai.

265
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:25,500
It got to be labeled.
Oh, look at the side.

266
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:27,250
- OK!
- Let me look, Lucas.

267
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,375
Oh, thank God!

268
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,250
Oh, thanks!

269
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:36,250
See that, boy?

270
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm all he's got in the world.
Do you understand?

271
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:44,375
I'm a doctor, too.
I'm bleeding. You've got to stop it.

272
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:48,125
Please, I need some antibiotics.
Please help.

273
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:18,250
- Are you okay?
- I lost my husband and two children.

274
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,125
If something happens to me...

275
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,125
What color is it?

276
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:00,375
- What?
- My leg.

277
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:06,417
- Still red?
- Yes, it's still red.

278
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,417
- What does that mean?
- It's good.

279
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:13,417
As long as it doesn't turn black.

280
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,083
You need to eat something.

281
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:23,167
Eat it.

282
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:34,125
- Don't bossy!
- I wonder who I take after.

283
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,292
Hello!

284
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,292
What's your name?

285
00:42:54,833 --> 00:43:00,667
My name is Maria, and this is my son, Lucas.
What's your name?

286
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:10,875
Hey, give her some tangerine.

287
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,167
She must be starving!

288
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,583
Be careful!

289
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:32,375
Turn your head to the side, please.
You'll choke if you don't.

290
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,708
Please, please!
She needs help.

291
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,708
Turn her head!
Help her, Lucas, help her!

292
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,583
Mom, are you okay?

293
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,333
Mom, Mom are you okay?

294
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,958
What are you doing?

295
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:55,333
Mom, are you okay?

296
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,417
Mom, stop it, stop it!
That's enough!

297
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:04,167
Mom, stop it! Mom!

298
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,542
Mom, stop it!

299
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:53,542
Francisca!
Francisca!

300
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:17,833
Lucas, look at this place.
They're so busy in here.

301
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:21,250
You got to go and do something.

302
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,292
Go and help people.
You're good at it.

303
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:31,583
- What do you want me to do?
- Just something. Anything.

304
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,875
Will you be alright?

305
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:40,417
Come on, Lucas!
I'm not going anywhere.

306
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,750
- I promise.
- Okay.

307
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,458
It's your family?

308
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,458
Adolph, Joseph, Walton.

309
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:23,875
- You're looking for your family?
- Have you seen them, Benstrom?

310
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:27,292
Okay, calm down!
I will help you. Okay?

311
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:31,500
I... I just... looking... Joseph.

312
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,458
I'll try to help you. Okay.

313
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,833
Okay.

314
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,708
Are you Benstrom?

315
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,292
Are you Benstrom?

316
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:47,208
Excuse, I need to access
to Morten Benstrom?

317
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,750
Morten Benstrom?

318
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,333
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

319
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:54,458
I'm looking for my... my son.

320
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:57,292
- Your son?
- Peter Barry.

321
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:01,708
- Yes. He'll be wondering where I am.
- OK!

322
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:04,208
Peter Barry?

323
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,583
Morten Benstrom?

324
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,583
Morten Benstrom?
Peter Barry? Joseph?...

325
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:13,583
Anne-Marie.

326
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,708
Sorry, what's her name again?

327
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,500
Anne-Marie de Von!
Anyone?

328
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,417
Radha Castorini.

329
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,458
Tatiana... Tatiana Jenochova.

330
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,625
- Kadum Pasedi.
- Pas... Pasedi?

331
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:32,625
Joseph Benstrom, anyone?

332
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,292
Pasegadi?

333
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:40,125
Morten Benstrom?
Radha Castorini?

334
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,458
Erik Stolman...

335
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,625
Anne-Marie De Brown?

336
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,333
- Morten Benstrom?
- Yes.

337
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:15,792
- Morten Benstrom from Sweden?
- Yes.

338
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,625
- I know your dad.
- Papa?

339
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,292
Yes, your papa is here.

340
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:24,708
- I'll bring him here. Okay?
- Yes.

341
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,458
No, no, no, you need to stay here.

342
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,167
I will bring your papa here. Okay?

343
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:31,875
No! No, you have to stay here,
you have to stay here,

344
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,583
because it's a very long way, and you
you have to rest. Okay?

345
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,917
Okay?

346
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:38,042
Okay.

347
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,042
Benstrom!

348
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:24,042
Where is my mom?

349
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,167
Mom?

350
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,500
Mom?

351
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:34,333
Mom!

352
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:39,333
No, no, what are you doing?

353
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:42,333
This is my mom's bed! Get off!

354
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,167
- Get off!
- OK, come on!

355
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:51,958
- It's okay! Take it easy, boy!
- No! My mom was here. And he takes her file.

356
00:50:57,208 --> 00:51:02,042
Look! You have to come with me.
I will help you.

357
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:03,333
Okay?

358
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:07,042
Okay.

359
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,750
What's your name?

360
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:57,250
- What's your name?
- Lucas Bennett.

361
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,208
Where were you staying?

362
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,208
Staying in... uh...

363
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:09,917
In, the Orchid beach resort in Khaolak.

364
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:12,083
Was somebody else traveling with you?

365
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:15,833
Lucas?

366
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:20,458
My dad, and my two little brothers.

367
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:26,208
Do you know what happened to them?

368
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:34,375
- Is there somebody we could call?
- Uh... uh...

369
00:52:35,792 --> 00:52:37,375
My granddad.

370
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:38,750
What's his name?

371
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:43,625
Bryan, but...
But I don't remember his number.

372
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,792
Lucas?

373
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,667
Lucas?

374
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,333
<i>Maria?</i>

375
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,417
<i>Maria?</i>

376
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,625
Lucas?

377
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,417
Lucas?

378
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:23,958
Maria!

379
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,333
Lucas!

380
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,083
Maria!

381
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,667
Hey man! You all right?

382
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,958
It seems till I hear me.

383
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:12,250
I'll be up in a second.

384
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,208
Don't even bother, they are sending
trucks to the mountains.

385
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:18,250
- Just staying on time, alright? They'll be here soon.
- Yes, I know.

386
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,875
- Can you tell them I'm back?
- Yeah, sure. Hold on.

387
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:31,667
<i>Hey boys, your dad is back!</i>

388
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:34,583
<i>- Dad! Dad!
- Dad!</i>

389
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,875
- Dad!
- Dad!

390
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:37,833
Hey!

391
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,500
Out the hallway
a helicopter just flew by.

392
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,667
- Did they?
- Yeah!

393
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,375
Mom and Lucas...

394
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,083
Why don't you come
down here a minute, Thomas?

395
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:49,250
What about me?

396
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,167
You stay and see if you can see
any more helicopters. Is that's okay?

397
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,250
- Okay.
- Good boy!

398
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,875
You're almost stepped right.

399
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,125
You got it?

400
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:02,708
Oh!

401
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,125
Oh!

402
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,375
Oh, my God!

403
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:12,958
I can't find them.

404
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,125
Did you see a lot of dead people?

405
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:20,875
While I'm a very serious commenter.

406
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:25,292
- Not mom and Lucas, right?
- No, I didn't see them.

407
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:31,167
I bumped my feet on the
reef, that was really hot.

408
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,417
- Everyone was leaving.
- Sure.

409
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:34,708
Can we leave yet?

410
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,875
I need you to them...

411
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:43,417
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.

412
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:48,125
It's time everyone going to the mountains,
seek to a shelter where it should be safe,

413
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,375
but I can't go with you.

414
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,417
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.

415
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,542
I have to keep looking for them, you see?

416
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,708
- You have to look after Simon.
- No!

417
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:03,708
No, stay with us,
I can't look...

418
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,542
I've never looked after someone before.

419
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:09,167
- I'm scared.
- I know, I know.

420
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,875
I'm scared too.

421
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:17,875
But you know, you know, the most
scary bit for me...

422
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,958
- When the water hit.
- No.

423
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:26,000
After that, when I
came up, I was on my own.

424
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,292
That was the scariest part.

425
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:32,083
And then I saw the two of
you climbing to the tree in there.

426
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:36,250
I didn't feel so scared anymore,
because I knew I wasn't on my own. You see?

427
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:41,250
What if Mommy and Lucas
are on their own right now...

428
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,417
Imagine how scared they'll be.

429
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:49,667
- We'll look for those in camps-
- No! Thomas, you have to look after Simon.

430
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:52,583
And I'm going to keep looking for them.

431
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,292
Okay?

432
00:59:57,417 --> 00:59:59,042
Okay?

433
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:03,125
Do you understand?

434
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,125
Hello.

435
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,292
Yeah, I hear you.

436
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,000
I'll be looking for him.

437
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,292
Are you alright? Have you lost someone?

438
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,542
We're fine.
We just want to get out of here.

439
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:46,417
Excuse me. I've been trying
to place a call back home.

440
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:48,833
I wonder if I could use
your phone? It will be very quick.

441
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,167
Look around you man, everybody's
needing something right now.

442
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:54,042
But our battery is almost dead,
and we need the phone.

443
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,125
I'll see you in the morning. Okay?

444
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,708
- You're not you coming?
- No, I'm not coming.

445
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,292
Thomas will take care of you, all right?

446
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,958
Listen to me, you can behave yourselves, okay?
And you need to stay with this group.

447
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:28,042
And I'm going to be with you just
as soon as I can. Okay?

448
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,292
You gonna behave yourselves. Okay?

449
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,167
I love you.

450
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:41,042
- Will you have my boys for me, please?
- Just come with us.

451
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,417
You know it's useless.

452
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,125
I can't stop looking.

453
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:53,583
I love you.
I'll see you tomorrow, I promise.

454
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,292
I love you.

455
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:17,583
<i>Maria</i>

456
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,000
<i>Lucas!</i>

457
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,125
<i>Maria!</i>

458
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,583
Lucas!

459
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:57,292
Oh, no!
No!

460
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,750
Hey man, are you okay?

461
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:21,000
Get in the car. We will drive
you somewhere safer.

462
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,583
My wife didn't want to come
to Thailand for Christmas holidays.

463
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,167
Because of my leg.

464
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:42,458
I insisted, my little girl, Ginna.

465
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,583
She's just two.

466
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,292
The noise woke me up.

467
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,208
I was alone in the room.

468
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,917
I went out to the terrace and saw the
sea coming in land.

469
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:03,583
It took me five seconds to reach the
stairs, but the water was already there.

470
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,000
It was not more than five seconds.

471
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:14,167
On the bed, I found a note from my
wife saying they were at the beach.

472
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,750
- You're at the Orchid, right?
- Yeah.

473
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:30,500
My whole family was around the
swimming-pool when the water hit.

474
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:37,042
I found my middle son first, Thomas, he
was on top of this really tall tree.

475
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:42,042
It took me forever to convince him to come
down, because he was so scared, you know.

476
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:48,167
And I found my little one, Simon,
he was holding on top of a palm tree.

477
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,458
He's only five.

478
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,875
I sent them to the mountains.

479
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:03,000
You know, so that I can keep looking
for my wife and my oldest son.

480
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,458
Toughest choice I ever made.

481
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:13,042
- Have you called home yet?
- I can't find a phone.

482
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:23,875
I'm saving my battery,
just in case, my family calls.

483
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,167
Please.

484
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,208
Thank you!
I will be very quick, I promise.

485
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,750
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Bryan?

486
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,042
<i>Yes Henry, thank God!
How are you doing?</i>

487
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:49,708
- Did you hear from anyone yet?
<i>- No Henry, you're the first call.</i>

488
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,625
<i>Is everyone all right?...
Henry?</i>

489
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,333
Maria and Lucas are not here.

490
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,458
<i>What do you mean, not there?</i>

491
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,083
The wave came and swept everyone away.

492
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:07,208
I found Thomas and Simon,
but not Maria and Lucas!...

493
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,458
I don't know what to do or
where to look for them!

494
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:15,792
<i>Henry. You have to calm down!</i>

495
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:21,042
<i>Henry? Henry?</i>
- I have to go. Many people need this phone, okay?

496
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,875
- I will call you later.
<i>- Henry?</i>

497
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,333
Sorry, sorry.

498
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,917
Thank you.

499
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:02,375
- What do you want me to do?
- You can't leave it like that.

500
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:06,625
- Go on, come on.
- Go on!

501
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,792
Come on man, come on!

502
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,625
Keep call him back.

503
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,792
<i>- Yes, Henry?
</i>- Bryan, it's me again. Look...

504
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,750
I promise you I won't stop
looking until I find them. OK?

505
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:29,250
<i>- Okay!</i>

506
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,208
I don't know what to do,
because it's nighttime now, but I'll....

507
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,750
I'll look in all hospitals, and I'll
look in all shelters find everything OK.

508
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,917
And I'll... I will find
them, I promise you that.

509
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:39,583
- I'll call you when I do.
<i>- Okay.</i>

510
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:41,917
- OK!
<i>- OK!</i>

511
01:07:43,792 --> 01:07:46,208
Thank you.

512
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,500
Can I go with you?

513
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:13,083
- I'm scared.
- Close of your eyes, and think of something nice.

514
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,750
May I sit with you?

515
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:44,208
How old are you?

516
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:50,083
Almost seventy-four.
And you?

517
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,250
Seven and a half.

518
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:57,083
You can't drop me.

519
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,625
- Is he alright?
- Yeah, he'll be alright.

520
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,917
With a blanket on him, he's alright.

521
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,792
You like looking at stars, don't you?

522
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:16,208
I do, stars like Alaska constellations.

523
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,625
Here, the sky is different.

524
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:28,083
Some of those stars have been
burned out for a long, long time.

525
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,625
Did you know that?

526
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:34,042
They're dead, aren't they?

527
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:42,917
They're dead, but once
they were so bright...

528
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:46,792
That their light is still
travelling through space.

529
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:49,500
And we can still see them.

530
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,375
How can you know which one
is dead and which is not?

531
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:56,083
No, you can't.
Impossible!

532
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,083
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?

533
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,208
Lucas Bennett, can you come with me?

534
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,958
Sit here.

535
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:02,417
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?

536
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:06,500
- Yeah.
- And your mother's name is Maria Bennett?

537
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,917
Is that correct?

538
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:14,792
We got you to look at those things,
please, and see if you recognize any of them?

539
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,417
Have a good look!

540
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,417
Take your time.

541
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:43,083
- Does anything look familiar?
- I don't know.

542
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,083
You don't know?

543
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,083
Aye!

544
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,792
- You recognize anything?
- I don't think so.

545
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,375
You don't think so?

546
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:05,375
Lucas?

547
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,250
Could you please come with us?

548
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,542
Mom.

549
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:39,958
- Where have you been you?
- Where the hell have I been?

550
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,958
Where the hell were you?
You promised me you weren't going anywhere.

551
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,417
I thought you were dead, Mom.

552
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:59,833
- Sorry.
- I thought you were dead.

553
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,417
We're so sorry.

554
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:15,583
Someone must have changed
her record during surgery.

555
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,583
How is she?

556
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:26,375
She had surgery on her
chest, but she lost a lot of blood.

557
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:29,833
She was too weak
to have her leg operated on.

558
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:33,417
She has to go back to
surgery when she recovers.

559
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:36,542
But she'll be okay, right?

560
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,250
Nothing. What next?

561
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,792
Consider...

562
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:53,292
We should try to get a ride
to Kathu Apal Hospital.

563
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:19,083
- Where are my kids?
- They took them away.

564
01:15:19,542 --> 01:15:21,708
- They didn't let me go with them. I'm Sorry.
- Where?

565
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:23,125
I don't know.

566
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:46,667
- I need to pee.
- You have to wait, Simon.

567
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:23,000
Mom... Mom. Wake up.

568
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:26,542
Mom, guess who I just saw outside.

569
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:30,125
My leg. How is my leg?

570
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,458
Still red.

571
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,292
Please, my mom.
Her wound's looking real bad.

572
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:14,167
We're doing the best we can.

573
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:18,417
We are taking your mom to
surgery right away.

574
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:40,625
No, no, five minutes.
Give me five minutes, please. Please!

575
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:42,542
OK!

576
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:44,833
I don't want you to slow down.

577
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:50,167
These are the names of my little girl Ginna
and Kathie, my wife. She's an American.

578
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,292
- Would you check the list for me?
- Of course.

579
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:58,625
Please, they told us her daughter could be in Surat Thani.
We already been to this hospital.

580
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:02,917
We have checked all
hospitals. But this one, please.

581
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,333
Five minutes, please!
Just only five minutes!

582
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,208
OK!

583
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,542
I won't be long. I'll be right back.

584
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:29,000
Lucas... Lucas...

585
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:34,208
Is there anything left in the can?

586
01:19:39,833 --> 01:19:43,750
Alright, I'll get you something.

587
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:01,458
Dad?

588
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:04,458
Dad!

589
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:07,750
Dad!

590
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:10,583
Dad!

591
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:17,375
Dad!

592
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:49,458
- I need to pee.
- Can you hold it?

593
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,042
No.

594
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,750
Simon, what are you doing?

595
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:08,792
Hurry up, they're going to leave us here.
What are you doing?

596
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:36,667
- No luck.
- Sorry.

597
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:43,208
Sorry, and thanks for waiting.

598
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,875
Thanks! We go now.

599
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,750
Dad!

600
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,375
It's Lucas!

601
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:42,167
- Lucas! Lucas!
- Lucas! Lucas!

602
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:45,917
- Lucas!
- Lucas!

603
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:51,083
- Simon! Thomas!
- Lucas! Lucas!

604
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,625
Are you okay?

605
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,458
Lucas!

606
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,542
- Dad!
- Lucas!

607
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:47,917
Dad!
Dad!

608
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:50,625
Lucas!

609
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:55,500
- Dad!
- Lucas!

610
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,083
- Dad!
- Lucas!

611
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:02,208
Dad! Dad!

612
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:20,042
Let's go, no need to wait.

613
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:37,125
- Mom is here.
- What?

614
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:41,958
She's very weak.
She said some weird stuff sometimes.

615
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:45,208
The nurse is going to try operate
on her as soon as they can.

616
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:53,542
Mom, look who's here.

617
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:05,958
Hey! Hey, my darling!

618
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:15,958
Mom.

619
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:22,083
- Is everyone okay?
- We are all okay.

620
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:34,417
- I'm gonna die.
- No, no.

621
01:27:40,417 --> 01:27:42,250
Is it okay to take this off?

622
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,500
It is in my cost.

623
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:04,958
- You came back?
- Yes.

624
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:10,542
I can rest now.

625
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:21,833
Maria, what?
What, what darling?

626
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:25,917
- I'm dying.
- No. No.

627
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:31,958
- You're going to be fine.
- Take care of my babies.

628
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:35,083
Hey, that's not why I came here for.

629
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,667
You're gonna be fine as
they're going to take good care of you, OK?

630
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:41,375
I promise you we are going to be fine.

631
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:46,333
- Henry. I'm scared.
- We're gonna be fine.

632
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:48,125
Henry!

633
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,542
I promise we're going to be okay.

634
01:28:51,708 --> 01:28:55,542
We're taking her for surgery.
We need to take her now.

635
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:57,375
Okay.

636
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:05,833
I love you.
You're gonna be okay.

637
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:10,292
I love you so much.
I love you.

638
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,000
You have to go now.

639
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:16,917
You know I love you.

640
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:20,125
I'm sorry, I have to leave your hand...

641
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:10,500
Lucas,

642
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,708
thanks for taking care of mom.

643
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:17,583
We took care of each other.

644
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:19,792
Yeah.

645
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:27,875
- Dad?
- Yeah.

646
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:30,250
There is something I didn't tell Mom,

647
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:34,125
and I really need her to know.

648
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,167
I have a family too.

649
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:08,708
I've been saving my strength...

650
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:13,708
Because I want to see them...
one more time.

651
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,708
<i>No, no.</i>

652
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,000
Oh, do you have to?

653
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,833
- We don't want you to feel any pain.
- I'm afraid to be asleep.

654
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:17,292
You're in good hands.

655
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:21,542
Close your eyes and
think of something nice.

656
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:26,125
Think of something nice.

657
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:55,458
Mom is okay, Lucas.

658
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:59,125
We're going home.

659
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:17,583
Mr. Bennett, I'm one of the customer holds
for the travel insurance.

660
01:36:17,583 --> 01:36:20,833
We have sent to take care of your family.
There is nothing to worry about now.

661
01:36:21,417 --> 01:36:23,542
In a few hours, we will be
at Singapore General Hospital.

662
01:36:23,542 --> 01:36:26,708
Where your wife will receive
the best treatment in your living.

663
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:30,708
These people will take you into a plane.
I'll see you over there.

664
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:32,458
Have a safe flight.

665
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:17,458
Where are we going?

666
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:23,875
They take us to Singapore.
We'll be safe there, OK?

667
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,917
Oh, please take your seat!
We will be taking off shortly.

668
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,042
Okay.

669
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,417
- Can I just...
- Yeah, okay. One minute.

670
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:12,208
How are you?

671
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:16,458
Here, with you.

672
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,792
Mom, guess what?

673
01:38:28,292 --> 01:38:30,458
I saw Daniel again...

674
01:38:33,042 --> 01:38:35,042
He was so happy.

675
01:38:38,458 --> 01:38:40,333
He was in somebody's arms.

676
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:45,167
I bet it was his dad, Mom.

677
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:55,583
I'm so proud of you.

678
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:03,333
I love you so much.

679
01:39:11,458 --> 01:39:14,625
Thank you. Thank you.

680
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:19,375
I feel sorry, but you have to
have back your seat now.

681
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:31,208
Fasten seat belts, please.

682
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:38,333
- I don't want to.
- No? You have to fasten your seatbelt in the plane.

683
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:17,375
<i>We are at the beach.</i>

684
01:40:31,917 --> 01:40:34,583
It's all right.

685
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:58,786
