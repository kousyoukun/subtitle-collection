有啊 那是我做的最后一件事

No, no, I was the last one 'cause I went back in.

18

这就意味着警报跟们没设好

他不老这样嘛 怕着怕那的
So what else is new, everything scares him?

43
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,333

107
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,125
明天吧

00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,042
闭上眼睛 想些开心的事
Just close your eyes and think of something nice.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,250
妈妈 来跟我玩皮球啊
Mom, would you go play ball with me?

110
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,583
待会儿 亲爱的 找卢卡斯玩

111
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,833
- 真不敢相信 你没救了  - 怎么了
- I can't believe you, the post list! - What?

112
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,042
我会把那玩意儿藏起来 然后不去管它
I hide that thing and I forget where I put it.

113
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,760
我就是在查看一下
I am on it just to check in to

114
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,542
看看有没有从日本发来的短信
see if there is a message filled later on in Japan.

115
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,167
骗子
Liar.

116
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,167
我收到条短信说老尼尔
There should be about text saying that O'Neil should...

117
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,583
的合同要延期两年
have been given us two years of extension on this contract.

118
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,417
这就意味着我们俩的职能重复了
Which means the two of us are doing the same job.

119
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:40,250
- 那就只有一种可能了  - 他们不能解雇你
- That can only really mean one thing. - They can't fire you.

120
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,417
那代价太昂贵了 别担心
That would be too expensive. Don't worry!

121
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,509
我还真担心
Well, I do worry.

122
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,542
我们承担不了失业的后果 不是吗
Because we can't afford to lose this job, can we?

123
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,292
我可以重新开始工作
I can go back to work.

124
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,042
- 也许是时候了  - 在日本吗
- Maybe it's time. - In Japan?

125
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,417
不是
No.

126
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,125
你想回家
Oh, you want to go home?

127
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,708
这主意也不算糟糕啦 对吧
It's not the worst idea, is it?

128
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,343
我们还需要考虑下
Well, you should think about it.

129
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,875
不过现在我得和孩子们玩儿了
But I'm going to play with the boys now, so...

130
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,875
接着 爸爸
Here, Dad!

131
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,208
接着
Catch it!

132
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,875
抓住它 卢卡斯 继续
Go get it, Lucas! Come on!

133
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,444
亨利 孩子们
Henry the boy!

134
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,583
- 卢卡斯 - 爸爸
- Lucas! - Dad!

135
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,458
卢卡斯
Lucas!

136
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,875
天哪
God!

137
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,875
上帝啊
God!

138
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,042
妈妈
Mom!

139
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,750
救命
Help!

I'm scared too.

425
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:17,875
但你知道我什么时候觉得最害怕吗
But you know, you know, the most scary bit for me...

426
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,958
- 大水冲过来的时候  - 不是
- When the water hit. - No.

427
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:26,000
在那之后 我浮出水面 发现我自己一个人
After that, when I came up, I was on my own.

428
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,292
那是最可怕的地方
That was the scariest part.

429
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:32,083
当我看到你们两个在往树上爬的时候
And then I saw the two of you climbing to the tree in there.

430
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:33,980
我突然没那么害怕了
I didn't feel so scared anymore,

431
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:36,250
那时我知道我不是一个人 懂吗
because I knew I wasn't on my own. You see?

432
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:41,250
如果妈妈和卢卡斯现在孤立无援呢
What if Mommy and Lucas are on their own right now...

433
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,417
想想他们该有多害怕
Imagine how scared they'll be.

434
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:46,583
- 我们可以一起去找他们  - 不行
- We'll look for those in camps- - No!

435
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,667
托马斯 你得照顾好西蒙
Thomas, you have to look after Simon.

436
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:52,583
我去继续找他们
And I'm going to keep looking for them.

437
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,292
好吗
Okay?

438
00:59:57,417 --> 00:59:59,042
好吗
Okay?

439
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:03,125
明白了吗
Do you understand?

440
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,125
喂
Hello.

441
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,292
我能听到
Yeah, I hear you.

442
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,000
我会找到他的
I'll be looking for him.

443
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,292
你们没事吧 有家人走丢了吗
Are you alright? Have you lost someone?

444
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,542
我们没事 只是想尽快离开这儿
We're fine. We just want to get out of here.

445
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:46,417
打扰一下 我一直在想办法打电话回家
Excuse me. I've been trying to place a call back home.

446
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:48,833
我能不能用一下你的手机 很快就好
I wonder if I could use your phone? It will be very quick.

447
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,167
看看周围吧 大家都需要帮助
Look around you man, everybody's needing something right now.

448
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:54,042
电池快用完了 我们还需要用
But our battery is almost dead, and we need the phone.

449
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,125
我明早就去找你们 好吗
I'll see you in the morning. Okay?

450
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,708
- 你不走吗  - 我不跟你们一起走
- You're not you coming? - No, I'm not coming.

451
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,292
托马斯会照顾你的 好吗
Thomas will take care of you, all right?

452
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,871
听着 你们得乖乖听话
Listen to me, you can behave yourselves,

453
01:01:21,872 --> 01:01:24,958
好吗 跟好他们不要走散了
okay? And you need to stay with this group.

454
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:28,042
我会尽快赶过去找你们
And I'm going to be with you just as soon as I can. Okay?

455
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,292
你们一定要听话
You gonna behave yourselves. Okay?

456
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,167
我爱你们
I love you.

457
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:40,021
你能帮我照顾一下两个儿子吗
Will you have my boys for me, please? 

458
01:01:40,022 --> 01:01:41,042
跟我们一起走吧
Just come with us.

459
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,417
你知道这是白费力气
You know it's useless.

460
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,125
我必须继续去找
I can't stop looking.

461
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:53,583
我爱你们 明天见 我保证
I love you. I'll see you tomorrow, I promise.

462
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,292
我爱你们
I love you.

463
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:17,583
玛丽亚
Maria

464
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,000
卢卡斯
Lucas!

465
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,125
玛丽亚
Maria!

466
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,583
卢卡斯
Lucas!

467
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:57,292
糟糕
Oh, no! No!

468
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,750
你没事吧
Hey man, are you okay?

469
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:21,000
上车吧 我们把你载到安全的地方
Get in the car. We will drive you somewhere safer.

470
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,583
我老婆本来不打算来泰国过圣诞的
My wife didn't want to come to Thailand for Christmas holidays.

471
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,167
因为我腿受伤了
Because of my leg.

472
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:42,458
我坚持要来 我的小女儿吉娜
I insisted, my little girl, Ginna.

473
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,583
她才两岁
She's just two.

474
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,292
当时我被巨响吵醒了
The noise woke me up.

475
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,208
发现自己一个人在房间里
I was alone in the room.

476
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,917
我走到阳台看到海水正冲上陆地
I went out to the terrace and saw the sea coming in land.

477
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,705
我花了五秒钟时间赶到楼梯那里
It took me five seconds to reach the stairs,

478
01:04:01,706 --> 01:04:03,583
水就已经漫上来了
but the water was already there.

479
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,000
连五秒钟都不用
It was not more than five seconds.

480
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,778
我在床上发现了我老婆
On the bed, I found a note

481
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:14,167
写给我的纸条 说她们在沙滩上
from my wife saying they were at the beach.

482
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,750
- 你当时是在兰花酒店吧  - 没错
- You're at the Orchid, right? - Yeah.

483
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:30,500
水冲过来的时候我们全家都在泳池附近
My whole family was around the swimming-pool when the water hit.

484
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,810
我最先找到了二儿子 托马斯
I found my middle son first, Thomas,

485
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:37,042
他在一棵很高的树顶上
he was on top of this really tall tree.

486
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,425
我花了好久好久才说服他爬下来
It took me forever to convince him to come down,

487
01:04:40,426 --> 01:04:42,042
他吓坏了
because he was so scared, you know.

488
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,735
后来又找到了小儿子
And I found my little one,

489
01:04:44,736 --> 01:04:48,167
西蒙 他在一棵棕榈树顶上
Simon, he was holding on top of a palm tree.

490
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,458
他只有五岁
He's only five.

491
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,875
我把他们送到山顶去了
I sent them to the mountains.

492
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,877
这样 我才能
You know, so that I can

493
01:04:59,878 --> 01:05:03,000
继续去找老婆和大儿子
keep looking for my wife and my oldest son.

494
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,458
这是我做过的最艰难的决定
Toughest choice I ever made.

495
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:13,042
- 你打过电话回家吗  - 我找不到电话
- Have you called home yet? - I can't find a phone.

496
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:23,875
我一直存着电量 就怕万一家里给我打电话
I'm saving my battery, just in case, my family calls.

497
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,167
请用吧
Please.

498
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,208
谢谢 我保证很快就用好
Thank you! I will be very quick, I promise.

499
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,750
- 喂  - 布莱
- Yes? - Bryan?

500
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,042
亨利 谢天谢地 你没事吧
Yes Henry, thank God! How are you doing?

501
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,790
有其他人给你电话吗
Did you hear from anyone yet?

502
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:49,708
没有 亨利 你是第一个打的
No Henry, you're the first call.

503
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,625
大家都没事吧 亨利
Is everyone all right?... Henry?

504
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,333
玛丽亚和卢卡斯不在这里
Maria and Lucas are not here.

505
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,458
不在那里是什么意思
What do you mean, not there?

506
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,083
海浪把大家都冲散了
The wave came and swept everyone away.

507
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:07,208
我找到了托马斯和西蒙 但是玛丽亚和卢卡斯没找到
I found Thomas and Simon, but not Maria and Lucas!...

508
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,458
我不知道该怎么办 不知道要去哪找
I don't know what to do or where to look for them!

509
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:15,792
亨利 冷静点
Henry. You have to calm down!

510
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:21,042
- 亨利 亨利  - 我得挂了 很多人都需要用这电话
- Henry? Henry? - I have to go. Many people need this phone, okay?

511
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,875
- 我晚点联系你 - 亨利
- I will call you later. - Henry?

512
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,333

Thank you.

514
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:02,375
- 你要我干嘛  - 你不能就这么挂了
- What do you want me to do? - You can't leave it like that.

515
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:06,625
- 继续啊 打回去吧  - 继续打啊
- Go on, come on. - Go on!

516
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,792

517
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,625
再给他打回去
Keep call him back.

518
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,792
- 亨利吗  - 布莱 还是我 听着
- Yes, Henry? - Bryan, it's me again. Look...

519
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,750
我发誓一定会找到他们的 好吗
I promise you I won't stop looking until I find them. OK?

520
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:29,250
好的
Okay!

521
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,208
我不知道该怎么做 这是场噩梦一样
I don't know what to do, because it's nighttime now, but I'll....

522
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,493
但我会找遍所有的医院
I'll look in all hospitals,

523
01:07:33,494 --> 01:07:35,750
寻遍所有的避难所

我会找到他们的 我保证

Thanks.

528
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,500
我能跟你一起去吗
Can I go with you?

529
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:13,083
- 我害怕  - 闭上眼睛 想点好事情
- I'm scared. - Close of your eyes, and think of something nice.

530
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,750
我能坐你旁边吗
May I sit with you?

531
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:44,208

- Is he alright? - Yeah, he'll be alright.

536
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,917
把谈资盖好 他就乖乖睡了
With a blanket on him, he's alright.

537
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,792
你喜欢看星星吗
You like looking at stars, don't you?

538
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:16,208
没错 大部分星座我都能找到
I do, stars like most of constellations.

539
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,625
这里的星座有点不同
Here, the sky is different.

540
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:28,083
有些星球很久很久以前就已经燃烧殆尽了
Some of those stars have been burned out for a long, long time.

541
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,625

542
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:34,042
它们死了 是吗
They're dead, aren't they?

543
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:42,917
它们是死了 不过他们曾经那么闪耀
They're dead, but once they were so bright...

544
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:46,792
他们的光芒仍然穿梭于宇宙中
That their light is still travelling through space.

545
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:49,500
我们仍然可以看到他们
And we can still see them.

546
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,375
你怎么知道哪一颗死了哪一颗没有呢
How can you know which one is dead and which is not?

547
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:56,083
你不能啊 所以这很不可思议
No, you can't. Impossible!

548
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,083
多么美好的悬念啊 是吧
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?

549
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,208
卢卡斯・贝内特 能跟我来吗

Is that correct?

554
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,815
我们想让你看看这些东西
We got you to look at those things,

555
