1
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:20,920
New York City.

2
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,123
He wants to see
what's there.

3
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:24,925
I can tell him
what's there.

4
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,317
I don't know how,
when you've never been.

5
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:24,323
Well, Toto, I guess
we're not in Kansas any more.

6
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,796
I can't figure out why he'd want to go
to New York when we got everything here.

7
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,878
Somethin' I have to do, Dad.

8
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,435
Did you pack an iron
like I told you to?

9
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:36,596
Mom.

10
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:39,724
You're gonna walk around
wrinkled in New York if you don't.

11
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:43,402
Elmer Whitfield's cousin Carlton
went off to New York a normal boy.

12
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:46,923
Came back with his head shaved
and an earring stuck in his cheek.

13
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,324
Mom, there's
a whole world out there.

14
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,841
I mean big, exciting.

15
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:31,157
I got a nice,
small apartment lined up.

16
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:33,397
I got a great job.

17
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,717
I wanna make
lots of money.

18
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:39,641
I want to have a meaningful experience
with an incredibly beautiful woman.

19
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,757
I can't even take a woman like that
to a small apartment.

20
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:45,281
- I gotta get a penthouse.
- A penthouse?

21
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,198
With a Jacuzzi in it.

22
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:51,081
Doin' this for you
as much as for me, Mom.

23
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:55,003
All those years of college...
They're gonna start payin' off.

24
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:53,160
Back!

25
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,599
All right, listen up.

26
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:13,884
If there are any bugs in here or rats or
anything that has more legs than I do...

27
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,720
you just stay on your side
of the room, okay?

28
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,718
I'll stay on mine.

29
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,405
I should warn you.
I'm packing an iron.

30
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,044
You weren't listening.

31
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,282
Darling, please pack it
as fast as you can.

32
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,642
- Mr Forbush?
- Not me! He's two doors down the hall.

33
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,843
Into the shredder
as fast as possible.

34
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,797
- Mr Forbush.
- Yep.

35
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:01,685
Hi, I'm Brantley Foster
from Kansas.

36
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,679
- You hired me. I start work here today.
- You're fired, kid. Sorry.

37
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,235
We all saw it coming, but we
looked for some kind of miracle.

38
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,885
Miracle never happened.

39
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,798
- What did happen?
- Hostile takeover.

40
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,606
Ninety percent of the people
in this building are out on the street.

41
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:17,123
You are one of those 90%.
Tough break.

42
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:22,081
Mr Forbush, I was counting on this job.
What do I do now?

43
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,319
Punt!

44
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,405
Okay, New York...

45
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,955
if this is the way
you want it, okay.

46
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:38,161
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Foster.

47
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,080
I'm sorry, Mr Foster.
We need someone with experience.

48
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:45,240
But how can I get experience until
I get a job that gives me experience?

49
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:47,363
If we gave you a job
just to give you experience...

50
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,086
you'd take that experience
and get a better job.

51
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,317
Then that experience
would benefit someone else.

52
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:55,285
But I was trained in college
to handle a job like this.

53
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,325
So in a sense,
I already have experience.

54
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,204
What you've got is
college experience...

55
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,563
not the practical, hard-nosed business
experience we're looking for.

56
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,878
If you'd joined our training program out
of high school, you'd be qualified now.

57
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,719
Then why did I go to college?

58
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,684
Had fun, didn't you?

59
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,599
What impresses me most...

60
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:19,236
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college.

61
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:22,160
Well, ma'am, I knew all
those years of college...

62
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,717
would be worthless without practical,
hard-nosed business experience.

63
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:28,879
"Assistant personnel manager,
J. Hall Communications.

64
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:31,959
Junior purchasing agent,
Midland Furniture.

65
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:34,959
Vice President in Charge of
Production, Central Manufacturing."

66
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,356
Outstanding.

67
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:42,325
You're not gonna tell me I have
too much experience, are you?

68
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:44,682
Certainly not.
You're perfect for the job.

69
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,280
- Great!
- Except...

70
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,562
No. No exceptions.

71
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,842
I want this job.
I need it. I can do it.

72
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,043
Everywhere I've been today
there's been something wrong.

73
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,357
Too young, too old,
too short, too tall.

74
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,358
Whatever the exception is,
I can fix it.

75
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,881
I can be older. I can be taller.
I can be anything.

76
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,958
Can you be
a minority woman?

77
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:07,763
- Mom, I'm doin' great.
<i>- Is it dirty? Are the people rude?</i>

78
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:10,407
No, this town is terrific.
The people are really nice.

79
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,877
<i>- That's good. What about yourjob?</i>
- Job? Hey!

80
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,357
I got a fantastic office,
got a gorgeous secretary. The works.

81
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:20,007
<i>We don't care if she's gorgeous.</i>
<i>Is she any good?</i>

82
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:22,806
- What?
<i>- You heard me. Can she type?</i>

83
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,605
Ma, of course she can type.

84
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:28,236
<i>Some can't, you know. Is it safe there?</i>
<i>You haven't been robbed?</i>

85
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:31,285
Ma, will you quit worryin'?
There is no danger.

86
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,280
<i>- But New York is...</i>
- New York is like Kansas intensified.

87
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,242
- What?
<i>- What's that? Something the matter?</i>

88
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,682
No, Mom.
That's just the TV.

89
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,076
<i>- It sounds so real.</i>
- It's <i>Miami Vice.</i>

90
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,203
<i>Can you turn the sound down?</i>
<i>It's too loud.</i>

91
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:49,279
Ma, it's broken.
The knob came off in my hand.

92
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:53,440
<i>Goodness. Well, what about</i>
<i>Uncle Howard? Did you call him?</i>

93
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,995
Uncle Howard!
Yeah, the phone number.

94
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,282
<i>Well, you still have</i>
<i>the number, don't you?</i>

95
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,598
Oh, yeah.
I got it right here.

96
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:03,882
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>You seem distracted.</i>

97
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,878
They just totalled a Ferrari.

98
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:08,606
<i>But Uncle Howard...</i>
<i>did you call him?</i>

99
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,121
No, I haven't had a chance
to call Uncle Howard yet.

100
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,879
<i>Will you try to see him?</i>

101
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,719
I'll probably bump into him
at the country club.

102
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,198
<i>Get the TVfixed, dear.</i>

103
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,845
Yeah.

104
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:22,237
- Listen, I gotta go. Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

105
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,921
- Give Dad my love.
<i>- I will, dear. I love you, Brantley.</i>

106
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:28,682
- I love you too, Mom. Bye-bye.
- Bye!

107
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:13,042
Well, at least let me
buy you an airline ticket.

108
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,038
Dad, I'm gonna do this
on my own.

109
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,800
But you did make it
a round-trip ticket?

110
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,321
Yeah. I'm not
gonna need it.

111
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,403
No, when I come back to Kansas,
I'm comin' back in my own jet.

112
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:45,683
Take this. It's Uncle Howard's
phone number in New York.

113
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,485
I got an uncle
in New York?

114
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,286
My cousin Ellen married
his half sister's nephew...

115
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:53,086
before she got bit
by that dog and died.

116
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,442
But he's still kin,
and kin is kin.

117
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,160
Hi.

118
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,523
I'd like to see
Mr Prescott, please.

119
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,802
Do you have
an appointment?

120
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:06,799
I tried to get one, but I couldn't,
so I just thought I'd surprise him.

121
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,196
Mr Prescott
doesn't like surprises.

122
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:12,245
- Everybody likes surprises.
- Not Mr Prescott.

123
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:16,086
- You can leave your name.
- Brantley Foster.

124
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,443
- Of?
- Of Kansas.

125
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,404
Of what company?

126
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,916
What do you wanna see
Mr Prescott about?

127
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,037
About being his nephew.

128
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:33,766
Well, why don't you
have a seat?

129
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,236
I'll see if I can work you
into Mr Prescott's schedule.

130
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:37,680
Thank you.

131
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,517
Give Uncle Howard my card.

132
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,997
Are you really
Mr Prescott's nephew?

133
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,798
In a roundabout
sort of way.

134
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:20,197
You sons of bitches don't
have a half a brain between you!

135
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:23,404
I'm looking at
a $300 million deficit here...

136
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:26,797
because you idiots didn't anticipate
the needs of a changing market!

137
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,526
- Uncle Howard?
- Now, get out, all of you!

138
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,757
And bring me back some
new ideas that'll work!

139
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:35,283
Or I'll have your heads
mounted on my wall!

140
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,086
- Geez, he's gonna burst a blood vessel.
- Yeah, wishful thinking.

141
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,318
I'll see if I can
get you in now.

142
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:42,760
Thank you.

143
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,196
You know, it can't be good
for his heart to shout that way.

144
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,198
He doesn't have a heart.

145
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,359
- What, Maureen, what?
- Brantley Foster is here to see you.

146
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,403
I don't know any Brantley Foster.

147
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,081
- Your nephew from Kansas.
- Who?

148
00:12:57,127 --> 00:13:00,642
- He says he's your nephew from Kansas.
- Kansas?

149
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:09,117
Mr Prescott
will see you now.

150
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,005
Clever.

151
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,806
So you're one
of the Kansas Fosters, huh?

152
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:21,276
Shirttail relative,
to say the least.

153
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,160
Listen...

154
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,637
I know you probably told your secretary
to get me outta here in five minutes.

155
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,524
- Two.
- Right.

156
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,520
So I'll get
right to the point.

157
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:36,636
- I need a job, Uncle Howard.
- Around here, I'm Mr Prescott.

158
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,243
Do you have any idea
what we do here?

159
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:40,646
Yes, sir.

160
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,924
Pemrose is a multinational conglomerate
with 27 different divisions.

161
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,999
Products ranging from dog food
to guided missile systems.

162
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,965
There are 30,000 people
working in this building alone.

163
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,880
Their accumulated salary is higher
than the gross national product...

164
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,640
of half the nations
in the Common Market.

165
00:13:55,727 --> 00:14:00,403
Last year we borrowed more money
from banks than Mexico did.

166
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,478
It's a great company, Uncle...

167
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,684
Mr Prescott. That's why I'm here.

168
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:10,922
What can you do for us, Brantley?
What experience have you had?

169
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,679
Practically none.

170
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,998
But I believe in myself.

171
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:23,844
Doesn't that count? Deep inside, I know
I can do anything if I get a chance.

172
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,402
Think back to when
you were my age.

173
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:31,682
Remember how you felt when
you went after that first job.

174
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,678
Remember how
you wanted it so badly...

175
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,678
you couldn't sleep
the night before the interview.

176
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,837
Remember how crushed you were
when the guy said...

177
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,838
"What kind
of experience have you got?"

178
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,765
You wanted to shake
your fists and say...

179
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:47,237
"I can do anything
if I can just get a chance."

180
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,881
They're ready for you
in the boardroom, Mr Prescott.

181
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,365
Call Bates in Personnel.
Tell him I'm sending somebody up.

182
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,724
Well, you're
in the front door, kid.

183
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:03,367
What you do on this side of it
is up to you.

184
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:10,880
Congratulations. He really
must have taken a shine to you.

185
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:14,437
Thanks. He's a warm guy.

186
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:23,921
May I?

187
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,760
You can't come in here, bozo.
Take your crap to the mail slot.

188
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,565
I work here. Just started.

189
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:12,400
What do you want, an engraved
invitation? Come on. Come on.

190
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,721
Brantley, eh?
Somebody gave you that name?

191
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:23,438
Jesus, a college puke!
This really makes my day.

192
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,757
- Well, you're welcome.
- Melrose, get over here!

193
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:33,916
Listen to what he says,
then do what he does.

194
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,601
Stay out of my way. Don't use
the stamp machine for personal letters.

195
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,838
Take off that stupid-looking tie.
Looks like you shot your couch.

196
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,236
- You got any questions?
- Yeah. What do I call you?

197
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,966
- Call me God.
- Got a problem, Boss? I'm your man.

198
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,686
Show the college puke the ropes
and keep him outta my face.

199
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,122
His name is Brantley.

200
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,482
All right, kid.
Follow me.

201
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,639
<i>All right, you stick with me</i>
<i>and everything's gonna be copacetic.</i>

202
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:59,924
<i>Twice a day you deliver. Like a mailman,</i>
<i>you pick up whatever's goin'out.</i>

203
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,044
<i>I can do it in 30 minutes.</i>
<i>Rattigan thinks it takes me two hours.</i>

204
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,197
What's this department?
What do they do here?

205
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:09,121
Who knows? This place is a zoo.
Nobody knows what anybody else is doin'.

206
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,118
Can you get promoted
out of the mailroom?

207
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:15,200
You can't even get paroled
out of the mailroom. Excuse me, dear.

208
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,245
Good morning.

209
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,761
- Nix.
- What?

210
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:23,566
- Good morning.
- Look, not the suits.

211
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:26,002
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me, sir.

212
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,362
- Good morning.
- Look, not the suits, man.

213
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:31,757
You never consort with the suits,
unless they consort with you first.

214
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,638
That's ridiculous. He's a person.
I'm a person. I can't say hello?

215
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:37,445
He's not a person.
He's a suit.

216
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:40,405
You're mailroom.
No consorting. Come on.

217
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,285
We're entering
a sensitive zone.

218
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,323
This guy in that office
just got canned.

219
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,921
Mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.

220
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,965
No kidding.
Is his job still open?

221
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,481
No, man, an economic cutback.
His job was dissolved.

222
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,035
About two dozen suits
got the ax.

223
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,640
Will you quit trying to consort?
Come on.

224
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,363
<i>All right,</i>
<i>the yellow ones go to Purchasing.</i>

225
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,836
<i>All the white ones are a bunch</i>
<i>of suits talkin'to themselves.</i>

226
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,875
You're supposed
to deliver 'em, not read 'em.

227
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,083
Some of this stuff
doesn't make any sense.

228
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,044
They send requisitions
through two departments...

229
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,719
to get procurements
for a third.

230
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:30,082
- What kind of thinking is that?
- That's suit thinking.

231
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,556
Something happens to a man
when he puts on a necktie.

232
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,444
Cuts off all the oxygen
to his brain.

233
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,437
You crazy? You're not supposed to
take the memos out of the mailroom.

234
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,325
I can't follow a chain of command
in this company.

235
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:46,604
They got the right title, but their job
assignments and objectives are screwed...

236
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,042
- Look at this. Jesus. Purchasing.
- What?

237
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,516
It's a joke. They've got two people
doin' basically the same job.

238
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,359
Neither one of them
is doin' it right.

239
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,358
I'll bring it up
at the next stockholders meeting.

240
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:58,519
- Would you put these things away?
- Whoa, Melrose.

241
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,364
How ya doin'? We've been gettin'
a lot of requests in the mailroom...

242
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,564
for stockholder information,
company assets, expenditures.

243
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,207
- Anything you can give us.
- You're kidding?

244
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,721
Any of this research you want,
you can have.

245
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,041
- Take it all.
- Thanks very much.

246
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,166
She's the most incredible-looking woman
I've ever seen in my life.

247
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:36,356
She's a Rolls-Royce,
but she's also a suit.

248
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:40,280
What's she like?
What do you know about her?

249
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,562
I know enough never
to consort with the suits, pal.

250
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:46,196
- Even when they do have legs like hers.
- Come on. You know more than that.

251
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,005
Her name is Christy Wills.

252
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,396
She's supposed to be some
sort of financial wizard, you know?

253
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,079
Harvard. All that crap.

254
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,078
And forget it.

255
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:16,526
No.
That's Transportation's problem.

256
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,837
No, we do not supply drivers
for executives' wives.

257
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:20,883
We are a messenger service.

258
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,800
I don't care
if the other drivers are all busy.

259
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,522
Yeah, well, the same
to you, sweetheart.

260
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,476
Hey, Dartmouth,
get over here.

261
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,717
Executive's wife wants
a ride up to Litchfield.

262
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:35,924
- Check out a car and drive her.
- Where's Litchfield?

263
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:38,475
You'll find it.
Just follow the smell of money.

264
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,238
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm not quite sure which way...

265
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,444
Turn the key, start the car,
put it in drive and step on the gas.

266
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,200
Any idiot can do that,
even my husband.

267
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,484
Excuse me, ma'am.

268
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,127
- I know I'm not supposed to consort...
- Then don't.

269
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:10,563
You seem kind of upset. I was wonderin'
if there was anything I could do.

270
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:13,398
I don't know.
My cook quit this morning.

271
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:15,921
My analyst is away on vacation.
My Mercedes broke down.

272
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:19,602
I split my nail, and my husband
is screwing somebody at the office.

273
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:21,803
What did you have in mind?

274
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,645
Stick of gum?

275
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,996
This is the third weekend he's found
an excuse not to come to the country.

276
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:36,679
No, I don't know. But knowing him,
it's probably some teenage airhead...

277
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,439
from the steno pool.

278
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,597
The last one I caught him with
was so dumb...

279
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,600
she thought dictation
was some kind of S and M trip.

280
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,518
Do you know my husband?

281
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,525
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

282
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,404
Never mind.

283
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:56,241
- Didn't hear a thing.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

284
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,483
I'm so mad, I could spit.

285
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:03,925
He looks twice as good today
as the day we were married.

286
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,918
I just look twice as old.

287
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:07,920
Are you kiddin'?

288
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:13,045
I hope that when I'm his age,
I can wake up every morning...

289
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,676
and find a woman as beautiful
as you are lying next to me.

290
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:19,361
Thank you.

291
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,445
Turn in here.

292
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,079
Please.

293
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:58,798
- Bring those inside. Charles.
- May I help you with those, sir?

294
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:00,684
What are you drinking?

295
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:03,361
I can't really.
I have to get back.

296
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:07,364
God, I hate the country.

297
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:11,040
Yeah, I can see
how you'd be real miserable here.

298
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,722
Who can live
with so many trees?

299
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:16,843
They suck up
all the oxygen.

300
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:20,116
No, actually,
trees produce oxygen.

301
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,118
Who are you? Mr Wizard?

302
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:25,402
What did you say your name was?

303
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,561
- Brantley.
- No, I mean your first name.

304
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:32,123
That's it: Brantley.

305
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:35,643
Well, Brantley, I don't know what
you want out of Pemrose Corporation...

306
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,638
but I'll tell you
what you do not want.

307
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:40,965
You don't ever, ever
wanna become a corporate wife.

308
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,999
I'll watch my step.

309
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:51,639
Have another.

310
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,765
Thanks.

311
00:27:57,607 --> 00:27:59,677
I've run 8,000 miles
on that tennis court...

312
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:03,442
chasing a fuzzy, little yellow ball
with an oversized racket.

313
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:05,279
Do my legs
look heavy to you?

314
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:08,522
No.

315
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:11,838
I've swum laps from here
to the moon in that pool.

316
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:15,361
Do you see anything
in this body that isn't firm?

317
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:20,844
Tennis, swimming,
aerobics, jogging, massage...

318
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:23,805
Anything and everything
to stay in shape.

319
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:25,798
Not that he'd ever notice.

320
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:30,602
So, Brantley, do you know
why I stay in shape?

321
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,887
- How 'bout a dip in the pool?
- No, wait!

322
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,356
Are you serious? Listen...

323
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:45,360
I have to get back. This is a
tempting diversion, but I got a job.

324
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:48,962
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- Transportation, please.

325
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:52,164
Yes. The young man from
the mailroom who drove me home?

326
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:56,126
He's going to stay here
and do a little work in my garden.

327
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,239
See that he gets full credit
on his time card.

328
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,806
Thank you.

329
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,762
Help me out of this, will you, dear?

330
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:23,596
- That was great.
- Thanks. I swim five miles a day.

331
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,440
- Supposed to tone my ass.
- Yeah, it works.

332
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,367
Just when I thought it was safe
to go back in the water.

333
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:46,317
- You sure this is a good idea?
- It's okay. I know the owner.

334
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,039
Last one out of the...

335
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:56,167
- Sure your husband's not coming home?
- Who knows?

336
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:58,359
He could be home any minute...

337
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,043
or several hours from now.

338
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:06,723
Oh, my God.

339
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:19,722
I'm gonna see that
my husband gives you a leg up.

340
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:22,765
I think we've done pretty well
so far by ourselves.

341
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,443
I mean Pemrose.

342
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:32,235
No.

343
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:34,166
No, thanks.

344
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:37,761
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top by myself.

345
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,681
God, you're adorable.

346
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:48,886
I could spend a week
inside those sweet, unwrinkled eyes.

347
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,923
- Can I make a personal observation?
- Anything but the thighs.

348
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:58,239
Somebody sold you a bill of goods and
convinced you you had to be 21 forever.

349
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:02,484
That's bullshit!
I think you're terrific.

350
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:05,081
The only thing wrong with you
is your husband is a jerk.

351
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,237
You're beautiful.
You're intelligent.

352
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,443
You're sensuous.

353
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,039
Say that again!

354
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:16,367
- Which part?
- All of it!

355
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:21,598
Oh, no!

356
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:24,795
- What? What is it?
- It's the jerk.

357
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,166
My husband.

358
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:37,001
- My uncle.
- Your what?

359
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:39,647
- Oh, God! That makes you...
- Auntie Vera?

360
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,718
What's my mother gonna say?

361
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:50,480
- I've disgraced my whole family.
- The hell you did!

362
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:54,085
Not funny! Okay?
This is not a funny moment in my life.

363
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,237
Relax.
Who's gonna find out?

364
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:58,124
I'm home!

365
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:01,767
He's gonna find out.
That's who's gonna find out.

366
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:03,803
Don't worry!
He won't fire you.

367
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,447
There's no way I'm gonna
get a raise out of this.

368
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:09,360
Vera, what's the company car
doing in the driveway?

369
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:12,564
It broke down, darling. The driver
had to take the train back to town.

370
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:15,366
No, he didn't, darling. He's in here
having trouble with his fly.

371
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,677
- Get back! Do you ever stop?
- No!

372
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,758
How am I gonna get home?

373
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:22,566
Maybe we'll just have to keep you here
and adopt you.

374
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,839
You're a riot, Vera.

375
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,838
Please, Lord,
get me out of this.

376
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:39,999
I'll go all over the world telling
people not to screw the boss's wife.

377
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:44,160
- What are you doing in here?
- Feeling romantic.

378
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,681
What's for dinner?

379
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:50,919
Oh, Howard! You really know how
to sweep a girl back onto her feet.

380
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,479
Go back!

381
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:06,603
Sit! Sit down!

382
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,685
You look like death on a cracker, man.
What happened to you?

383
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:19,396
I was chased by a 200-pound dog
with a mouth as big as my head.

384
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:21,682
And that was the best thing
that happened last night.

385
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,235
- What was the worst thing?
- I got laid.

386
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,522
I'm not sure you got
your priorities straight.

387
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,639
Hold the elevator.
Good morning.

388
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,959
Hi.

389
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,919
<i>We're entering a sensitive zone.</i>

390
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:10,077
<i>The guy in that office</i>
<i>just got canned.</i>

391
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:13,364
<i>The mailroom knew about it on Friday.</i>
<i>Hejust found out today.</i>

392
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:52,441
<i>I'm gonna see</i>
<i>that my husband gives you a leg up.</i>

393
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,518
No, thanks.

394
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,000
No.

395
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:00,636
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top on my own.

396
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:52,039
- Hello.
<i>- Tucker, where the hell have you been?</i>

397
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:54,004
We got a problem
in Midwest Distribution.

398
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,555
What are you gonna do about it?

399
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:59,081
What's the problem?

400
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:02,557
Our stock is down
another quarter point this morning.

401
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:04,399
Whose fault is that,
Thomas?

402
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:07,240
Nobody's fault, sir.
It's a momentary lapse in the market.

403
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:10,399
- Whose fault is it, Thomas?
- It's Davis's fault, sir.

404
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:12,557
His department hasn't been
pulling its weight.

405
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:15,684
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I've been having troubles at home.

406
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,042
My wife ran over
the children's dog with her car...

407
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:20,038
then we had to buy
a new dog.

408
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:23,199
Then the new dog chewed up this
entire report that I'd been working on.

409
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,999
Are you suggesting
that your dog ate your homework?

410
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,805
In a way, yes, sir.

411
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:32,562
This is not grade school, Davis!
Run at the back of the line.

412
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:34,558
- Consider yourself on warning.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:38,765
Everybody, check your pulse. Make sure
you're exercising at the optimum level.

414
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:43,317
I'm a bit above my level.
I better stop running now, maybe.

415
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:46,922
- I'm above too.
- I really don't care. Everybody, run!

416
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:51,205
<i>I can't get anybody's approval</i>
<i>for the extra two trucks!</i>

417
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,437
<i>Tucker, what're you</i>
<i>gonna do about it?</i>

418
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:57,997
All right, look.
What does a boxcar cost?

419
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:00,317
The transfer sheet
shows that somebody...

420
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:02,796
is accumulating
an enormous block of our stock.

421
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,084
- What do you think about that, Thomas?
- I think it's very encouraging.

422
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,237
- You do, do you?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,602
When a stock takes a dive
and somebody buys a ton of it...

424
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,882
It means that stock is
on its way to a quick rebound.

425
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,084
It means that the company
is ripe for a hostile takeover!

426
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,079
- That's what I meant!
- A hostile takeover, sir?

427
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,840
Yes. I'm afraid that's
what we're looking at.

428
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,804
I want each of you
to examine your department...

429
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,639
and see where you can cut costs.

430
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,604
Cut! Cut them to the core!

431
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,485
We need to raise capital quickly
so we can boost stock support.

432
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:34,196
Boost it!
Boost it to the moon!

433
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:36,198
You gonna put that
in writin'?

434
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,959
Yeah.

435
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:43,800
You tell the trucking company
that we have to service our customers.

436
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,243
If they're not gonna help us,
we're gonna find somebody who will.

437
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:49,045
Well, all right!

438
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:52,563
That's what we need, some gutsy
decisions! I'll get back to you.

439
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,717
Okay. Bye.

440
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,281
Yes!

441
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:49,763
I have got to get that report
by the end of the day, Art...

442
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:51,439
or you're in the doghouse!

443
00:38:51,527 --> 00:38:53,279
I don't know.
Mr Prescott?

444
00:38:57,607 --> 00:38:59,996
I'm sorry this came in so late,
but it just arrived.

445
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,361
It's about time!

446
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:09,359
- This isn't the men's room.
- No.

447
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,200
They took the urinals out last week.
I didn't like them.

448
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:14,562
How about a paper cup?

449
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:15,602
What?

450
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,042
Sorry. I'm just about the only
woman executive at Pemrose.

451
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:21,119
Some days, I have a chip
about the men's room.

452
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:22,401
Sorry.

453
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,358
Hey, nice office.

454
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,484
Nice furniture.
It goes with your hair.

455
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:32,039
Thank you. I like your suit.
It goes nicely with your nose.

456
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:36,006
Well.

457
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:40,796
This conversation
isn't going very well.

458
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:45,645
Thank you. There's enough talk
in the world already. Good morning.

459
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,718
That meant "good-bye."

460
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:55,765
I have work.

461
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:02,680
Sorry.
I have a lot of work myself.

462
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:08,879
Good morning.

463
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,206
I really swept her
off her feet.

464
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:39,037
All right, Foster.
Let's do it!

465
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:47,002
Hello. This is
Carlton Whitfield, 4319.

466
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:50,724
That's right. I'm still waiting for
that secretary I requested last week.

467
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:55,242
I realize you're
busy down there...

468
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,682
but I'm typing my own letters
and answering my own calls...

469
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,678
and it's getting
to be a pain.

470
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:01,920
Empty?

471
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:06,236
Well, I've been here a week,
got my name on the door...

472
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,966
got a desk full of supplies and
a geranium on my window ledge.

473
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:11,277
What I don't have
is a secretary.

474
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:14,644
Okay, I'll tell you what.

475
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:18,037
I'll have Personnel send a boy up from
the mailroom with the requisitions.

476
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:21,836
Just send me my secretary, okay?
Thank you very much.

477
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:41,078
Got a memo here. Big cheese in 4319
wants his new secretary pronto.

478
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,078
I got a memo here that's
burning up my fingers.

479
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,445
New suit in 4319 wants his personalized
memos and stationery immediately.

480
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:49,358
- This guy is hot.
- Who?

481
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:51,278
I don't know.
Name's on the memo.

482
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,803
He wants nameplates for his door,
and he wants it by noon. Okay?

483
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,206
Smile.

484
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,325
- You're late.
- I already done my rounds.

485
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:04,999
You didn't punch in.

486
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:08,796
Well, I couldn't wait to get to it.
Boy, I love my work.

487
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:12,516
Punch in, then run this up to Personnel
and wait for an answer.

488
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,120
Right.

489
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:36,686
I'm Jean,
your secretary.

490
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,598
I'm not wearing anything.

491
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:41,042
I see that.

492
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,358
It was warm.

493
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,120
Seems cooler now.
I'll get dressed.

494
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:51,558
Yes, sir.
I'll move my stuff in.

495
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:53,956
Great, Jean.
Good idea.

496
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:09,084
Jean? I have
some notes here.

497
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,965
I also have some charts,
some graphs, some tapes.

498
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,436
They're all sorted by department.
Can you read my handwriting?

499
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:16,199
- Sort of.
- Do your best.

500
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:18,926
I need some poster boards,
coloured pencils, coloured push pins...

501
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:23,444
T square, drawing table, lots of
pencils, and my lunch. Chinese?

502
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,956
- Hey, 4319?
- Yeah.

503
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,600
Great.

504
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:37,917
- Morning.
- Morning.

505
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:45,795
- Morning.
- Hi.

506
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:04,960
Hello again.
Small world.

507
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:07,839
Hello.

508
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:17,516
Are you standing still
for some purpose?

509
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:20,843
Hey, I'm just soaking up
the atmosphere.

510
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:25,117
Executive lounge, huh?

511
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:28,244
- Care to do a little lounging?
- No, I'm busy.

512
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:31,399
Ron, did you get those figures
on transfer costs and insurance?

513
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:34,320
Not yet.
Big delay in Chicago.

514
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:37,399
- Damn! I really need them!
- Blame Chicago.

515
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,398
- Maybe I can help.
- I'm sorry?

516
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,205
Transfer costs
and insurance for what?

517
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:43,881
By the time I explained,
I could find out myself.

518
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,278
Ron. Big weenie.

519
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,040
Hey, listen. Why don't you
explain it to me over lunch?

520
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:52,324
- I'll have the answer by dessert.
- I don't eat lunch.

521
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:56,075
Why don't we start this again?
Carlton Whitfield. And you're?

522
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:58,078
Annoyed. Shit.

523
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:02,484
You know, I'm just
trying to be friendly.

524
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:05,798
You picked a bad time. I was counting
on those figures from Ron.

525
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:07,843
- Christy Wills. How do you do?
- Good.

526
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:11,160
Terrible news.
Just awful!

527
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:13,803
Conference room, everybody.
Come on. On the double.

528
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:19,437
- You don't eat lunch. Do you eat dinner?
- Occasionally.

529
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,085
- Tonight?
- Booked.

530
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:23,442
- Tomorrow night?
- Booked.

531
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:26,280
All right, but don't beg, okay?
It's embarrassing.

532
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:33,120
Who are you?

533
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,961
Carlton Whitfield.
New employee.

534
00:46:40,887 --> 00:46:43,242
I didn't get a memo
on that.

535
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:44,885
You will.

536
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:48,357
All right.
As long as I get the memo.

537
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:56,366
The absolute worst has happened.
We are the target of a corporate raid.

538
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:00,281
Donald Davenport has filed a 13-D.

539
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,244
A 13-D?

540
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,238
He's acquired five percent
of the stock...

541
00:47:04,327 --> 00:47:08,923
and this is definitely the beginning of
a hostile takeover of our corporation.

542
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:11,999
I think we all know what happened the
last time Davenport took over a company.

543
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:13,600
Everyone was canned!

544
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:17,764
Mr Prescott has sent down word
of what he wants us to do.

545
00:47:17,847 --> 00:47:21,317
We are to recommend cuts
in every department.

546
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:26,242
Our job is to slash the red ink
in every nook and cranny...

547
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:30,081
because our company needs
the cash for its defence.

548
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:34,197
Anybody wanna fire
the first shot?

549
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,120
Kill Toledo.

550
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:42,043
If we close down
our distribution centres...

551
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,845
in Toledo, Joplin, Jacksonville...

552
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,236
we'll slash the red ink
completely off the books.

553
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,442
Whitfield, you don't have
to raise your hand. Just speak.

554
00:47:51,527 --> 00:47:53,199
Thank you.

555
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,563
Well, I know I'm new here
and everything.

556
00:47:56,647 --> 00:47:58,717
On the surface, these cuts
seem like a good idea...

557
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:00,399
"Seem like a good idea"?

558
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:02,876
But closing down those distribution
centres would be a big mistake.

559
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:06,323
It so happens that those closings
are exactly what Mr Prescott wants.

560
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,601
Well, then Mr Prescott hasn't
thought things through very well.

561
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,126
I'm going to tell him you said that.

562
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,677
Good. Closing down
those centres...

563
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,917
will put a strain on
this company's cash position.

564
00:48:18,007 --> 00:48:20,999
In the long run, those cuts are going
to hurt this company's innate value.

565
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:24,363
Innate value?
What is he talking about?

566
00:48:24,447 --> 00:48:27,120
Davidson here will back me up
on this. Davidson?

567
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:28,720
I'm Proctor. He's Davidson.

568
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:30,718
Well, damn it,
Davidson, tell him!

569
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,401
You wrote a memo to Mr Thomas
explaining what I'm talking about.

570
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:35,762
Well, how did you know
I wrote that memo?

571
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:43,198
How did I know
you wrote that memo?

572
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,523
Who else could write
that memo, Davidson?

573
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:52,801
That memo was famous.

574
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:54,798
That memo was a masterpiece.

575
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:58,596
Clear, concise, to the point.
That was the best damn memo I ever read!

576
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:02,204
In fact, that memo wasn't even a memo.
That memo was literature.

577
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,005
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

578
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:07,477
If you have finished your book report,
could you explain what your point is?

579
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:10,877
- The point is, we gotta be bold.
- That's my point.

580
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:13,765
We gotta build. We gotta expand.

581
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:16,520
Expanding is the only way
to help the situation.

582
00:49:16,607 --> 00:49:18,484
We gotta make
this company so damn strong...

583
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:21,798
Davenport won't be able to find anyone
willing to give up Pemrose stock.

584
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:24,924
It'll be too damn valuable.
Then we'll buy <i>his</i> ass out!

585
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:32,961
- How old are you, Mister...
- Whitfield.

586
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:34,958
- Yes.
- Twenty-four.

587
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:37,515
I think you should keep quiet
until you're at least 25.

588
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:41,917
If I may, I don't think Whitfield's age
should be an issue here.

589
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:44,885
No one is interested
in your opinion, Davis.

590
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:47,276
We gotta block
that takeover.

591
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:49,278
I'm too old to look
for another job.

592
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:51,403
Nobody in their right mind
would hire me.

593
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:58,602
This meeting is going nowhere!

594
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:01,155
Mr Prescott's
command stands!

595
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:04,284
We are to find those cuts!

596
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,164
Meeting adjourned.

597
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:13,846
You'll pick up the coats.
That looks like one only a lot smaller.

598
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,395
Hey! Harvard!
Where the hell've you been?

599
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:20,605
Personnel. You said to wait for
an answer. They are real slow up there.

600
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,201
There's something going on
around here, Foster.

601
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,597
I'm gonna be on you like a rash.
You got that? Like a rash.

602
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:30,724
Won't the other guys get jealous?
Heads!

603
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:58,798
You guys were good tonight.

604
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:13,442
Oh, God.
What are you doin' here?

605
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:16,678
Brantley, darling, I heard you calling
me telepathically... I'm very psychic...

606
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,758
so of course
I rushed right over.

607
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:24,286
- I would've used the phone.
- Mental telepathy's much more reliable.

608
00:52:25,887 --> 00:52:27,843
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

609
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,915
Yeah. Sorry.

610
00:52:33,007 --> 00:52:34,679
Just a minute.

611
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:47,281
Father used to live like this
before he founded Pemrose.

612
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:49,085
Aunt Vera...

613
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,284
I had a hell of a day,
and I really have to get some sleep.

614
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:55,915
Brantley,
you're a young man.

615
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:59,402
Young men have
lots of energy.

616
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:03,522
Look.

617
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,967
- We have a problem.
- What?

618
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,125
Your husband is my boss.

619
00:53:12,207 --> 00:53:15,244
Oh, him.
We won't tell him.

620
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:18,807
Besides,
Howard's working late tonight.

621
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:21,481
On whom, I have no idea.

622
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:25,924
You look very beautiful
tonight, Christy.

623
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:29,522
Thank you. Now, there are some
business things we should discuss.

624
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:32,997
Do you think that this restaurant
has an upstairs with beds in it?

625
00:53:33,087 --> 00:53:35,362
Howard, please!

626
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:38,803
I don't feel altogether good
about what's happened between us.

627
00:53:39,487 --> 00:53:41,682
You are married.

628
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,361
- I'm not married.
- You are married!

629
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:48,326
Well, yeah, I am married,
but she and I have an understanding.

630
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:10,327
- I love you.
- I don't really think so.

631
00:54:10,407 --> 00:54:13,638
Well, then I lust after you.
That oughta be worth something.

632
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:16,002
To you, perhaps.
Now, let's talk business.

633
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,362
I pitched the need for cutbacks
at the meeting today...

634
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:21,484
but a dissenting opinion was offered
by Carlton Whitfield.

635
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:24,240
Who's Carlton Whitfield?
I didn't hire any Carlton Whitfield.

636
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,840
Somebody did.

637
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:28,919
- Oh, my God. Donald Davenport.
- What?

638
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:31,999
He may be a plant for Davenport,
gathering information on the takeover.

639
00:54:32,087 --> 00:54:35,716
It's just like him. I want you
to get close to this guy Whitfield.

640
00:54:35,807 --> 00:54:37,479
Find out what he's up to.

641
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,559
- You want me to spy on him?
- No, I don't want you to spy on him.

642
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:42,524
I want you to get
to be friends with him...

643
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:44,518
then rifle through his papers
and tell me what you find.

644
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:46,404
That's spying, Howard.

645
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:49,399
Look, you have got to drop
this incessant innocence.

646
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:53,275
Life is harsh and ugly,
and only the strong survive.

647
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:55,358
Or didn't they teach you that
at Harvard?

648
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,715
- What you got in there?
- My lunch.

649
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:03,798
Your lunch?
In a briefcase?

650
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:06,526
Yeah.
Ran out of brown bags.

651
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,963
One of you guys got
a spare pair of laces?

652
00:55:10,047 --> 00:55:12,402
Hey, man, I had a babe last night
you wouldn't believe.

653
00:55:12,487 --> 00:55:16,844
"Ta-Na's" out to here, man.
She was fine. Where'd he go?

654
00:55:33,607 --> 00:55:36,280
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- Take it easy. Come on.

655
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,437
Sorry.

656
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:10,365
- What a nightmare.
- Stuck again?

657
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,438
- I'm all right, though. I'm fine.
- You okay?

658
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:16,406
- You all right?
- Don't worry about me. Thanks.

659
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:20,605
Jean, transcribe these notes. There's
some things on there I need right away.

660
00:56:21,207 --> 00:56:24,085
Make copies of this,
copies of this.

661
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:26,476
- Did you get those supplies I needed?
- Yes, sir.

662
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,525
Good.
I'll be back later.

663
00:56:34,927 --> 00:56:36,838
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning.

664
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:47,846
- Goddam that thing!
- This thing stuck again?

665
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:52,844
These elevators are stuck again?

666
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,404
I'm sick and tired of these
elevators always gettin' stuck.

667
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:09,078
Hi, Jean. Will you take
those to the cleaners?

668
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,840
These are some of the notes
I found in Whitfield's office.

669
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:36,839
If you want anything more,
you can go after it yourself.

670
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,123
Do you think he's working
for Davenport?

671
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:43,200
I have no idea.
I'm out of the spy business.

672
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,720
We can't wait for Whitfield
any longer. Let's get started.

673
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:54,882
Davis here has prepared what I'm sure
is a thoroughly incompetent analysis...

674
00:57:54,927 --> 00:57:57,316
but let's listen to him read it
before we start criticizing.

675
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,284
Fine. I won't read it at all.
Is that all right?

676
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:02,279
You have a bad attitude, and I am
gonna tell Mr Prescott about it.

677
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,801
Does anybody else
have anything to say?

678
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,526
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

679
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:11,677
Sorry. Hi, everybody.

680
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:14,557
Casual attire today, Whitfield?

681
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:18,519
Yeah, trousers, yeah.

682
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:21,485
New product line.
Testing 'em out. Pretty good.

683
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:24,001
- Good fabric.
- Good idea.

684
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:27,081
- Christy, you have something to say.
- Yes.

685
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:30,000
I came up with some more cuts
in the Middle States area.

686
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:31,839
Let me pass these out.

687
00:58:31,927 --> 00:58:35,158
Why can't you be
more like her, Davis?

688
00:58:36,287 --> 00:58:39,040
Mr Prescott!
Well, what a surprise!

689
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:43,278
Art, I haven't received
the full report on the cutbacks yet...

690
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:45,835
so I thought I'd drop in
and see what the problem is.

691
00:58:45,927 --> 00:58:48,725
No problem.
No, sir. Everything is tip-top.

692
00:58:48,807 --> 00:58:51,037
Whitfield has pointed out
a few wrinkles...

693
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,925
and we are going
to iron those wrinkles out.

694
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:56,918
You don't mind
if I stay for a few minutes, do you?

695
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:58,679
Yes, sir.

696
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:02,165
- Which one of you is Whitfield?
- Oh, my God!

697
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,045
Nosebleed! Dry heat!
Get 'em all the time!

698
00:59:05,127 --> 00:59:07,800
Oh, God!
No sight for the squeamish.

699
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,679
Who was that?

700
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:12,957
Well, that's the new boy, Whitfield.

701
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:22,761
Sorry.

702
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:25,165
Needed some supplies.

703
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:27,477
Well, back to business.

704
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:31,001
A few of these, and...

705
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:32,679
Oh, God!

706
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:35,961
You're from Receiving,
aren't you?

707
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,843
<i>I see you're a workaholic.</i>

708
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:44,159
Yeah, well...

709
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:47,803
I got a lot of work to do.

710
00:59:49,647 --> 00:59:53,606
- What are you doing here so late?
- I'm a workaholic too.

711
00:59:54,087 --> 00:59:56,476
Wow. You mean we have
something in common?

712
00:59:59,047 --> 01:00:03,040
So, what's all this supposed to be?

713
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:07,325
It's the heart and soul of an idea
you hated: expansion in the Midwest.

714
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,637
I don't hate it.
I just think it's risky.

715
01:00:09,727 --> 01:00:11,604
Furthermore,
Mr Prescott doesn't want it.

716
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:13,962
It's a waste of time to pursue it.

717
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:17,481
But if something's right,
how can it be a waste of time?

718
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:20,684
There is no right or wrong.
There is only opinion.

719
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:27,041
You know, in some states,
you can get arrested for saying that.

720
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,162
All right. Convince me.

721
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:34,600
Convince me then that
your opinion is the right one.

722
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:37,246
All right.

723
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:40,799
Take a look at this.
And this.

724
01:00:41,447 --> 01:00:43,961
<i>And, yeah.</i>

725
01:00:44,047 --> 01:00:46,277
<i>Peruse that.</i>

726
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:49,439
Why do you keep saying
the exact opposite of what I say?

727
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:53,162
- 'Cause you keep saying stupid things.
- Will you look at these figures?

728
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:55,317
They prove that
the elimination of salaries...

729
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:57,967
would create a war chest for
the defence of the Pemrose Corporation.

730
01:00:58,047 --> 01:01:00,038
- Can't you see that?
- No, I can't. I'll tell you why.

731
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:03,119
Closing those factories is just gonna
send a panic through the market.

732
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:06,563
- That might happen or that might not.
- No, it will happen.

733
01:01:06,647 --> 01:01:10,196
All right, close the centres,
put thousands of people out of work.

734
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:13,040
You're gonna waste all your profits
on unemployment contributions...

735
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,641
severance pay, union lawsuits.

736
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:17,999
Are you all right?

737
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:20,806
- My blood sugar's dropping.
- What?

738
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:23,162
It's just my mind wandered in
the middle of what you were saying.

739
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:26,796
It means I need food.
Do you wanna get a bite?

740
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:30,721
- Yeah, come on. I'll buy you dinner.
- No, no, no. Dutch.

741
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:36,279
Just tell me one more time
what your solution is to this crisis.

742
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:40,076
- We don't cut. We expand.
- I agree.

743
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:43,364
Expansion is a positive reaction
to the universe.

744
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:46,007
While retraction
or cutting back or pulling off...

745
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:48,647
Those are all negative forces.

746
01:01:48,727 --> 01:01:52,640
I used to be very negative, and
then I took this personality workshop.

747
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,924
My whole life turned around.

748
01:01:55,687 --> 01:01:57,757
Hiya.
My name's Sheila.

749
01:01:58,287 --> 01:02:01,677
You make a good-lookin' couple.
How long you been goin' together?

750
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:05,282
- About 20 minutes.
- First date, huh? Good luck.

751
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:07,278
No, we're business colleagues.

752
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:09,562
Colleagues!
Who needs that?

753
01:02:09,647 --> 01:02:11,763
You should go together.
You look good together.

754
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:17,719
Did you wanna order?

755
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:22,322
- Yeah, we need to see some menus.
- Menus! I'm sorry.

756
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:26,723
I'm studying to be an actress. I'm
a better actress than I am a waitress.

757
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:29,605
Concentration, that's my big problem.
I'll be right back.

758
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:33,918
Well, Sheila's in favour
of expansion.

759
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:38,085
We should bring her to our next meeting.
Art Thomas would like her a lot.

760
01:02:38,407 --> 01:02:40,967
Sheila is also in favour of us
seeing each other.

761
01:02:41,047 --> 01:02:44,278
- Yes, well, Sheila is clearly a nut.
- I heard that.

762
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:46,597
You should try to be
more positive with your life...

763
01:02:46,687 --> 01:02:48,882
or you're gonna wind up miserable.

764
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:50,446
She heard me.

765
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:57,203
I'm having a nice time.
How 'bout you?

766
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:59,278
Yes, very nice.

767
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,198
Well, it's pleasant walking.

768
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:03,755
I mean,
I don't want to imply anything.

769
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:09,281
About your expansion plan,
I did some checking...

770
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:13,997
and we can get some tax breaks if we
put up a facility in the Midwest region.

771
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:17,116
You checked? Earlier today?

772
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,725
That's great.

773
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:21,367
The powers that be seem
to want the cutting, but l...

774
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:25,838
I've been trying to stay open
to your ideas... your business ideas.

775
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,519
That's great.

776
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:36,161
Okay, so you're
open to my business ideas.

777
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:39,159
Now, how about
my after-work ideas?

778
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:42,802
Don't push. Yesterday,
I thought you were obnoxious.

779
01:03:45,847 --> 01:03:48,315
You know, a lot of people
start out that way.

780
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,725
- They usually end up gettin' married.
- Don't hold your breath.

781
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:54,445
Come on.

782
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:59,199
Look, I think
you're secretly crazy about me.

783
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:02,438
And I think you'd feel a lot better
if you'd just admit it.

784
01:04:03,487 --> 01:04:07,082
Come on. You'll like me.
I'm an acquired taste.

785
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:26,239
My dad insisted
on buying me this.

786
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:30,043
A round-trip ticket
back to Kansas.

787
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:33,758
I almost traded it in
a couple of times.

788
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:36,525
But now, it's kind of a symbol.

789
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,723
The day I use this ticket...

790
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,318
is the day New York
has beaten me.

791
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,198
You know,
I just noticed something.

792
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:49,476
- You're kind of a mess.
- Thank you.

793
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:52,604
- Did anybody ever tell you that?
- You're the first.

794
01:04:52,687 --> 01:04:54,882
So what I was wonderin' was...

795
01:04:56,967 --> 01:05:00,004
how you can be
so incredibly beautiful...

796
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:02,123
and be such a mess?

797
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:07,161
When two people get involved
on a project together...

798
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:10,478
there's a danger
of getting emotionally involved.

799
01:05:11,767 --> 01:05:13,519
That would be bad.

800
01:05:13,607 --> 01:05:16,838
They confuse the intensity
of their involvement on the project...

801
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:19,077
and mistake it
as a relationship.

802
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:25,485
- What are you, a shrink?
- It's happened to me.

803
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:27,762
It's actually still happening
to me, I guess.

804
01:05:27,847 --> 01:05:29,997
And then...

805
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:33,443
the project ends and they find
they don't have anything to talk about.

806
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:37,447
Okay, it's settled then.

807
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:42,677
We won't get involved
while we're working on this project.

808
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,126
Right.

809
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,603
So who is he?

810
01:05:55,687 --> 01:05:57,040
Who?

811
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:59,925
Who? My competition.

812
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:01,599
Just a guy.

813
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:04,803
All right,
so why don't we call this guy?

814
01:06:04,887 --> 01:06:06,798
Tell him you met a new guy.
The whole thing is off.

815
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:10,482
- I can't call him.
- Why not?

816
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,842
His wife might answer
the phone.

817
01:06:15,207 --> 01:06:17,767
- Big mistake.
- Yeah, well, let's not talk about it.

818
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:20,680
- I've done a lot of stupid things...
- I bet you have.

819
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:22,439
- but I have never...
- Ever?

820
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:27,401
been involved with a married man.

821
01:06:27,807 --> 01:06:30,401
Well, he was sort of separated
when we started.

822
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,716
Yeah, well,
it turned out to be a lie.

823
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:38,321
The whole thing
was a mistake.

824
01:06:39,367 --> 01:06:42,086
But we live and we learn
and we move on...

825
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:57,639
That wasn't bad.

826
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:00,120
Thank you.

827
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,722
Can you do it again
just as good?

828
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:09,244
I could try.

829
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:19,366
- Where were you all weekend?
- At least begin with "good morning."

830
01:08:19,447 --> 01:08:21,881
I'm madder than hell!

831
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:25,315
I want to know why
you weren't answering your phone.

832
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:27,284
I owe a lot to you, Howard.

833
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:29,676
I'll always be grateful for the chance
you gave me in this company...

834
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:31,485
and the things I've learned.

835
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:35,124
What is this?
What are you leading up to?

836
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:36,925
<i>I wanna work with you.</i>

837
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:39,680
<i>I respect you</i>
<i>more than you know, but...</i>

838
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:44,122
I can't be involved with you
outside the office any more.

839
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:47,959
Hello?

840
01:08:54,007 --> 01:08:58,558
Yes, I'm looking for the transportation
costs from Toledo dating September...

841
01:08:58,647 --> 01:09:00,365
I'll call you back.

842
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:06,440
Look, I'm not
gonna pressure you on this.

843
01:09:06,527 --> 01:09:08,324
I want you to take your own time...

844
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:11,436
and decide what's best for you.

845
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,165
Thank you.

846
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:18,205
I do think the timing's
a little ironic, though.

847
01:09:19,127 --> 01:09:21,083
I was gonna tell you
last night...

848
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:25,124
that Vera and I have agreed
on terms for a divorce.

849
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:30,396
I only wish that Vera and I
could have worked things out sooner.

850
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:33,880
That way, you and I
might have had a chance.

851
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,880
This arrived this morning
by messenger.

852
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:42,396
Davenport has called
an emergency meeting...

853
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:46,002
of the board of directors
for Monday morning...

854
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:48,442
and he's offering
to take over the company.

855
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:53,926
I'm inviting all key personnel to spend
the weekend at my house in Litchfield.

856
01:09:54,727 --> 01:09:56,524
I'd like you
to be there too.

857
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,638
Of course I'll be there.

858
01:10:01,887 --> 01:10:05,163
One more question... personal.

859
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:09,321
Just out of curiosity,
who were you with last night?

860
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:13,765
Whitfield.
Carlton Whitfield.

861
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:18,357
It was all business.
Some of his ideas are brilliant.

862
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,723
I'm looking forward to hearing 'em.
I have to talk to him today.

863
01:10:23,447 --> 01:10:27,565
Those notes that I took from Whitfield's
office... I'd like them back, please.

864
01:10:27,647 --> 01:10:30,366
Of course.
I'll get them to you.

865
01:10:30,447 --> 01:10:32,517
Heads up. Thanks.

866
01:10:34,927 --> 01:10:38,044
What's your hurry?
What's goin' on?

867
01:10:38,127 --> 01:10:40,436
I got a special delivery
here marked "urgent."

868
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,165
I'm watching you, Foster.

869
01:10:42,247 --> 01:10:43,965
Just remember, every minute...

870
01:10:44,047 --> 01:10:45,924
God is watching you.

871
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:50,957
Excuse me, Miss, I'm a reporter for the
<i>Times,</i> and I couldn't help noticing...

872
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:53,038
you look like a woman
who's recently been made love to.

873
01:10:53,127 --> 01:10:55,277
- Not here.
- You weren't made love to here.

874
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:57,835
Was it anywhere within the New York
State lines, because we usually let...

875
01:10:57,927 --> 01:11:00,725
the <i>Philadelphia Gazette</i>
handle Pennsylvania.

876
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:04,838
What's up?
You seem kind of upset.

877
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,883
I hate men.

878
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,117
Well, I'm glad
I'm not one of'em.

879
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:12,918
Listen, there's something
I gotta explain to you.

880
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:16,602
I have something to tell you too.
I did something I wish I hadn't, and...

881
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,080
All right, look.

882
01:11:19,527 --> 01:11:21,882
- This weekend?
- Can't.

883
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:26,085
- I have some loose ends to tie up.
- Good!

884
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:29,279
- I'll take care of it.
- Have a nice weekend. See you Monday.

885
01:11:34,407 --> 01:11:36,363
Excuse me, Miss.
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

886
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:39,918
You didn't see me.
I wasn't here.

887
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:46,405
- Where is he? Where'd he go?
- I didn't see him. He wasn't here.

888
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:57,598
You still here?

889
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:00,159
You look great.

890
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:06,076
The end of the second lap,
you still got a comfortable lead.

891
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:12,884
Excuse me again.

892
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:17,159
- Hi, boss.
- Shit!

893
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,606
Bye, boss.

894
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:26,484
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

895
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:28,444
Looking for Whitfield.
Got a delivery for him.

896
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:30,085
Why are you wearing a suit?

897
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,685
- Because of the funeral.
- Whose funeral?

898
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:38,077
A friend. He died.
We buried him.

899
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:40,839
What is all this stuff?

900
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:45,640
Production performance charts
for the Midwest region, I guess.

901
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:50,080
Where is Whitfield?

902
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,800
He's not here?

903
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:56,603
- Have you ever seen Whitfield?
- Yes, sir.

904
01:12:56,687 --> 01:12:58,279
Well, lots of times.

905
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,835
I deliver here every day.
Great guy.

906
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:03,723
How does he get
all this information?

907
01:13:03,807 --> 01:13:07,038
Well, it's available in most
quarterly stock reports...

908
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:09,805
probably.

909
01:13:12,207 --> 01:13:14,198
- Take this up to my office.
- Yes, sir.

910
01:13:20,007 --> 01:13:23,079
- You're not comin'?
- I'll be there in a minute.

911
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,283
One question:
What the hell are you doin'?

912
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:38,801
- Having a nervous breakdown.
- No wonder.

913
01:13:38,887 --> 01:13:41,606
Look, nothin' good can come from this.
If you get caught, you get canned.

914
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:43,803
If you don't get caught, you become
one of them... a suit.

915
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:48,119
- It's a no-win situation.
- I'm still a half a step ahead of them.

916
01:13:58,887 --> 01:14:02,960
<i>I hear music when I look at you</i>

917
01:14:03,047 --> 01:14:06,119
Aunt Vera, hi.
How are you?

918
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:11,039
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

919
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:14,802
<i>Simply because you're near me</i>

920
01:14:14,887 --> 01:14:17,685
A medley. Gee, that's nice.

921
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:19,723
Why are you singing a medley?

922
01:14:19,807 --> 01:14:23,561
<i>I get no kick from champagne</i>

923
01:14:23,647 --> 01:14:29,244
- <i>Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all</i>
- Please, don't sing any more.

924
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:31,795
Oh, God!

925
01:14:31,887 --> 01:14:34,526
I haven't sung in years.
You see what you do to me?

926
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:36,199
He's on his way up.

927
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:39,757
He's gonna be here any minute.
Why are you doing this?

928
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:42,441
- I'm going to have you for lunch.
- Can't I get you a ham and cheese?

929
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,438
Look at that
cute little Adam's apple.

930
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,200
Listen. Oh, shit. Since the last time
we met, there's been a change.

931
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:50,323
Yes, nice suit, Brantley.

932
01:14:51,207 --> 01:14:54,643
Look, what I mean to say is...
Oh, Christ!

933
01:14:54,727 --> 01:14:57,287
- I'm not free any more.
- You're gonna charge me?

934
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,756
You're getting awfully cynical.
Does your mother know about this?

935
01:14:59,847 --> 01:15:04,045
- No, I mean I'm not available!
- Good, you're not gonna charge me.

936
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:07,246
Don't worry, Brantley. I don't wanna
marry you. I'm already married.

937
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:09,761
- I just wanna love you.
- Love.

938
01:15:09,847 --> 01:15:13,078
I don't mean love as in two star-crossed
virginettes running through the clover.

939
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:16,443
Nothing icky like that. I'm a practical
woman. You should be a practical man.

940
01:15:16,527 --> 01:15:20,076
If you just let me, I could steer you
through these shark-infested waters...

941
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,522
of this stupid company
just like I steered Howard.

942
01:15:22,607 --> 01:15:25,599
Look, I like you. I really like you.
But I gotta tell you.

943
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,282
I've become seriously and emotionally
involved with someone who isn't my aunt.

944
01:15:29,927 --> 01:15:32,760
- I forgive you, Brantley.
- Listen!

945
01:15:33,207 --> 01:15:35,767
- There is someone else in my life!
- I got it. I don't care.

946
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:37,724
There's someone else
in my life too.

947
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:40,719
Maybe we should introduce
your girlfriend and my husband.

948
01:15:40,807 --> 01:15:44,356
Look, I don't wanna get rough with you,
but I'll belt you around if I have to.

949
01:15:44,447 --> 01:15:48,076
Jesus Christ, Vera!
I'm gonna get fired. Gimme a break.

950
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,203
Don't whine, Brantley.
Life is too short.

951
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:53,563
Before you know it, you'll be 25,
wondering where it all went.

952
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:59,525
- What the hell is this?
- He fainted.

953
01:15:59,607 --> 01:16:00,835
Fainted?

954
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:05,446
- Dead away.
- Actually, he hit his head.

955
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,519
- It was like fainting. Knocked out.
- Hit his head on what?

956
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:09,926
- The floor.
- The ceiling.

957
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:11,406
- Which one?
- Both.

958
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:13,603
- Neither.
- What the hell happened?

959
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:16,326
Uncle Howard,
it was like this.

960
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:18,762
I walked into your office...

961
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:21,563
and I saw this beautiful woman...

962
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:23,723
who I had never seen before
in my life.

963
01:16:23,807 --> 01:16:27,561
And imagine my surprise
when I found out it was my Aunt Vera.

964
01:16:27,647 --> 01:16:31,481
Well, he was so excited,
his blood pressure shot up...

965
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:33,523
and then he fell and
hit his head on the floor.

966
01:16:33,607 --> 01:16:38,283
Out like a light.
So I crawled deliriously to the sofa.

967
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,881
- And I rushed to his aid.
- And you walked in.

968
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:45,006
And shame on you for not telling me
our nephew's working for the company.

969
01:16:45,087 --> 01:16:46,805
Our nephew works
for the company.

970
01:16:46,887 --> 01:16:48,684
I've got a million things
to take care of today.

971
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,644
- Why are you here?
- Lunch.

972
01:16:50,727 --> 01:16:53,685
- We were supposed to have lunch.
- I've had my lunch.

973
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:57,442
- You don't seem to realize...
- I do realize, Howard.

974
01:16:57,527 --> 01:17:00,644
So, you won't mind if Brantley and I go
out to lunch to get better acquainted?

975
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:04,606
- Fine.
- I can't. I gotta go to a funeral.

976
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:06,803
You said you already went.

977
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:10,961
You know, in my grief, I forgot.

978
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:16,843
Why don't we bring Brantley out
to the house this weekend for the party?

979
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,679
I mean, he is family.

980
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:23,516
Yes, you know, that might be
a very good idea.

981
01:17:23,607 --> 01:17:25,563
No, I don't think
I'd fit in, Aunt Vera.

982
01:17:25,647 --> 01:17:28,241
But you do fit in,
Brantley.

983
01:17:28,327 --> 01:17:30,318
I'll make sure he has a wonderful time.

984
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:34,241
All right. It's settled.
Now, can I get back to work here?

985
01:17:35,487 --> 01:17:37,921
It'll be nice to have
a playmate for the weekend.

986
01:17:47,087 --> 01:17:50,966
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, yeah, Brantley.

987
01:17:51,047 --> 01:17:54,437
I want you to know I've been
watching you very closely lately.

988
01:17:54,527 --> 01:17:58,122
- You have?
- I know <i>everything</i> you've been up to.

989
01:17:59,047 --> 01:18:01,277
- You do?
- Everything.

990
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:06,721
Sir, I can explain this.
See, I didn't know who that was...

991
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,480
I know, for example, that you've
been working hard in the mailroom.

992
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:11,603
You've kept your eyes open
and your nose clean.

993
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,484
You stayed out of trouble.

994
01:18:14,247 --> 01:18:16,886
I'm gonna reward you for that
one of these days.

995
01:18:17,687 --> 01:18:21,157
But first I'd like to ask
a favour of you.

996
01:18:22,647 --> 01:18:24,239
You name it, sir.

997
01:18:24,327 --> 01:18:26,557
We'll talk about it
while we work out.

998
01:18:28,247 --> 01:18:30,556
You like to sweat,
don't you, Brantley?

999
01:18:35,967 --> 01:18:39,039
Your Aunt Vera seems to have
taken an instant liking to you.

1000
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,765
- I hadn't noticed.
- It's obvious.

1001
01:18:43,847 --> 01:18:46,964
I think she'd like to get
to know you a lot better.

1002
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:48,799
I want to encourage that.

1003
01:18:49,407 --> 01:18:52,080
I'd like you to spend
lots of time with Aunt Vera...

1004
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,123
at the party this weekend.

1005
01:18:55,967 --> 01:19:00,199
Men like us can't be locked in
to one woman, Brantley.

1006
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:04,519
We need variety.
Keeps us young, energetic, competitive.

1007
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:08,759
You get my meaning? Of course you do.
We're men of the world, right?

1008
01:19:08,847 --> 01:19:11,361
Now, a problem
has developed.

1009
01:19:11,407 --> 01:19:15,002
- I have a friend, a companion...
- A girl.

1010
01:19:15,527 --> 01:19:18,325
She's been getting
a little antsy lately.

1011
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:20,125
Wants me to leave my wife.

1012
01:19:20,207 --> 01:19:23,756
Well, I'm not about to leave my wife...
not for her, not for anyone.

1013
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:27,283
I just need a little time to get
the situation under control again.

1014
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:29,927
- Understand?
- Not altogether.

1015
01:19:30,007 --> 01:19:32,316
Well, I'm inviting her out
to the party this weekend...

1016
01:19:32,407 --> 01:19:34,796
and we're gonna spend
a little time together...

1017
01:19:34,887 --> 01:19:37,276
which is why I need you
to keep your Aunt Vera...

1018
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:39,961
occupied as much as possible.

1019
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:42,322
- Get the picture?
- Yeah, wide-screen.

1020
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:45,877
- But I got some big plans this weekend.
- Fine. I won't forget this favour.

1021
01:19:45,927 --> 01:19:48,760
- No, you don't understand. See...
- Great. It's all settled then.

1022
01:19:49,447 --> 01:19:52,757
I've got my eye out for some rapid
advancement for you, Brantley.

1023
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:56,635
You seem to be a young man
with a lot on the ball. Keep it up.

1024
01:20:00,647 --> 01:20:02,239
Schmuck.

1025
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:07,723
That's nice.

1026
01:20:08,727 --> 01:20:12,845
Excuse me. Brantley, darling,
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

1027
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:19,798
I'm going to introduce you to the most
powerful money men in New York.

1028
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,684
If you can do to them
what you've done to me...

1029
01:20:21,767 --> 01:20:24,645
- I can't do that.
- I mean bowl them over, darling.

1030
01:20:24,727 --> 01:20:27,685
You're irresistible
when you turn on that boyish charm.

1031
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:30,235
- Hi, Whitfield.
- Whitfield?

1032
01:20:30,327 --> 01:20:32,238
Yeah, it's my middle name.
Brantley Whitfield...

1033
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,204
- Hi, Carlton.
- Carlton Foster.

1034
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:37,245
- You go by all those names?
- Yeah, I got a lot of'em.

1035
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:41,036
My parents couldn't make up their mind.
My monogram looks like an eye chart.

1036
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:45,282
You're always surprising me, Brantley.
That's your most attractive quality.

1037
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:48,556
Promise me
you'll never stop.

1038
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:52,886
- I promise.
- Good. Now.

1039
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:56,516
Roland Owens, First Federal.
Very rich. We start with him.

1040
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:59,246
He made his money
the really old-fashioned way.

1041
01:20:59,327 --> 01:21:01,204
He inherited it.

1042
01:21:01,287 --> 01:21:03,198
And see the man playing tennis
with the elbow brace...

1043
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:04,845
the knee strap and the glove?

1044
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:07,964
Vernon S. Fletcher,
Wall Street's iron man.

1045
01:21:08,047 --> 01:21:11,801
If he likes you, you can write
your own ticket, and he'll like you.

1046
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:13,798
Who's the tall guy
with all the girls?

1047
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:17,482
Good eye, Brantley.
Harley McMasters, First Multinational.

1048
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:22,197
Recently divorced. They're all dying to
be the second Mrs First Multinational.

1049
01:21:22,727 --> 01:21:27,039
Listen, you're not gonna tell anybody
I work in the mailroom, are ya?

1050
01:21:27,127 --> 01:21:28,799
Trust me, Brantley.

1051
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:30,957
I got Howard his key
to the executive washroom.

1052
01:21:31,047 --> 01:21:32,958
I can do the same thing for you.

1053
01:21:38,847 --> 01:21:40,644
Here are Whitfield's notes.

1054
01:21:43,207 --> 01:21:45,118
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

1055
01:21:46,927 --> 01:21:50,203
This is supposed to be
a business trip, remember?

1056
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:53,120
Baby, how can I concentrate
on business?

1057
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:55,644
Howard, let me go!

1058
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:07,206
What are you doing here?

1059
01:22:07,847 --> 01:22:10,566
Would Carlton Whitfield
miss a party?

1060
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:13,764
- I'm so glad you're here.
- So am I.

1061
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:17,280
Quick!

1062
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:19,719
Stop! Not here!

1063
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:25,198
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1064
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:28,085
Wait. I gotta tuck.
You go first. Go first.

1065
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:31,125
- How do I look?
- Come on. Come on.

1066
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:33,801
Well, I've had a look
at that preliminary report...

1067
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:37,277
and I'm satisfied that the proposed
cutbacks are our best line of defence.

1068
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:40,325
Thank you, sir. We have tried
to cut hard and to cut deep.

1069
01:22:40,407 --> 01:22:44,639
- Yes. The job was adequately done.
- Thank you, sir.

1070
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:47,321
I think Whitfield is right,
and this report is wrong.

1071
01:24:27,847 --> 01:24:30,805
- Have you seen Christy?
- No, I haven't, sir. Not for a while.

1072
01:24:33,687 --> 01:24:36,565
- Have you seen Christy?
- Sorry. No, I haven't.

1073
01:24:39,047 --> 01:24:41,242
- Jack.
- Yes, Howard.

1074
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:42,999
Have you seen
Christy Wills?

1075
01:24:43,087 --> 01:24:44,964
She's talking
to Whitfield.

1076
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:52,205
No? Come on.
That's my best... trust me.

1077
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,039
It's my best one.

1078
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:56,436
Would you excuse us
for a minute, Christy?

1079
01:25:02,887 --> 01:25:05,481
Brantley, did you know
that Whitfield is here?

1080
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,362
Yeah, I think he was
here earlier, but he left.

1081
01:25:08,447 --> 01:25:11,405
No. Somebody saw him
a few minutes ago talking to Christy.

1082
01:25:13,727 --> 01:25:15,922
Now, I've got my reasons.

1083
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:17,918
I want you to stay
close to Christy...

1084
01:25:18,007 --> 01:25:20,077
and keep Whitfield
away from her.

1085
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,556
Can you do that for me?

1086
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:24,558
Hey, I'm your man.

1087
01:25:24,647 --> 01:25:27,878
Good. I knew
I could count on you.

1088
01:25:33,407 --> 01:25:35,284
What was that all about?

1089
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:39,599
Well, he wants me to stay
as close to you as possible.

1090
01:25:40,207 --> 01:25:42,402
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

1091
01:25:43,687 --> 01:25:46,326
I don't know. I guess he thinks
we make a good couple.

1092
01:26:28,927 --> 01:26:30,565
Are you awake?

1093
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:17,646
Darling?

1094
01:29:58,687 --> 01:30:01,042
Sweetheart, it's Howard.

1095
01:30:01,127 --> 01:30:04,563
- Go away!
- Let's make this a night to remember.

1096
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:07,605
Darling, I know
you're angry with me...

1097
01:30:07,687 --> 01:30:11,396
but think of all the things
that we've meant to each other.

1098
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:15,040
I want to marry you, Christy.

1099
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:24,479
Don't be that way, baby.

1100
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:34,279
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

1101
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:36,801
No, but I'd like
to beat the shit outta you!

1102
01:30:43,087 --> 01:30:44,805
Wait till I get my...

1103
01:30:48,847 --> 01:30:50,280
Who is that?

1104
01:30:51,367 --> 01:30:53,278
Oh, my God!

1105
01:30:54,047 --> 01:30:55,446
Oh, my God!

1106
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:58,917
The sexual revolution is over.
Everybody, out of bed.

1107
01:31:00,327 --> 01:31:02,795
What are you doing
in Christy's bed, Brantley?

1108
01:31:02,887 --> 01:31:05,196
- I'm talking to you, Howard.
- Who's Brantley?

1109
01:31:05,287 --> 01:31:08,962
Brantley is the guy who just found
his stolen notes in your bag.

1110
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:12,960
Those are Whitfield's notes, and they
are not stolen. He gave them to me.

1111
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:16,403
You were so grateful to him, you climbed
into bed and asked him to marry you.

1112
01:31:16,487 --> 01:31:18,921
What are you talking about?
I climbed into bed with you.

1113
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,122
Baloney!

1114
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:22,038
You thought you were
climbing into bed with her.

1115
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:25,085
Wait. When I came in,
he was in bed with Whitfield.

1116
01:31:25,167 --> 01:31:27,203
Whitfield?
He wasn't even here.

1117
01:31:27,287 --> 01:31:29,642
- Are you blind? Who's that?
- That's Brantley.

1118
01:31:30,727 --> 01:31:33,685
So this is the bimbo you've been
screwing around with at the office?

1119
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:36,884
- Who are you calling a bimbo?
- If the shoe fits...

1120
01:31:36,967 --> 01:31:38,844
What's that supposed to mean?

1121
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:41,043
Why didn't you ask for those?
I would have given 'em to you.

1122
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:43,960
I was gonna tell you about that.
It happened before I really knew you.

1123
01:31:44,047 --> 01:31:48,006
So when we were in bed, that whole
thing was James Bond time, right?

1124
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:51,238
- No!
- You went to bed with Brantley?

1125
01:31:51,327 --> 01:31:55,002
Don't worry, Howard. She's probably got
microfilm pictures of the whole thing.

1126
01:31:55,087 --> 01:31:56,964
What were you doing
in bed with my nephew?

1127
01:31:57,047 --> 01:31:59,720
- Whitfield's your nephew?
- This is Brantley Foster.

1128
01:31:59,807 --> 01:32:01,479
He works in the mailroom.

1129
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:03,922
The mailroom?
You mean you're not an executive?

1130
01:32:04,007 --> 01:32:07,716
Let me get this straight.
Brantley is Whitfield?

1131
01:32:07,807 --> 01:32:09,160
That's right.

1132
01:32:09,247 --> 01:32:12,000
Brantley is Whitfield.
Whitfield is Brantley.

1133
01:32:12,087 --> 01:32:13,520
And Christy is the bimbo.

1134
01:32:13,607 --> 01:32:16,326
Well, now that we've had
Mouseketeer roll call...

1135
01:32:16,407 --> 01:32:18,637
I'm just going to go
call my lawyer.

1136
01:32:18,727 --> 01:32:22,003
Wait. Christy is not the bimbo I was
screwing around with at the office.

1137
01:32:22,087 --> 01:32:23,805
People better stop
calling me "bimbo."

1138
01:32:23,887 --> 01:32:25,525
It was an entirely different bimbo.

1139
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:28,201
That's fine. How many
bimbos would you say there were?

1140
01:32:28,287 --> 01:32:31,404
I misspoke myself.
There weren't any bimbos at all.

1141
01:32:31,487 --> 01:32:33,876
- Except Christy.
- Right. No!

1142
01:32:35,487 --> 01:32:38,684
The question is, how many people
did you sleep with to get to the top?

1143
01:32:42,047 --> 01:32:44,641
That was a very expensive vase,
you bitch.

1144
01:32:44,687 --> 01:32:48,441
Shut up! Now listen. Whatever I did
was my business, not yours.

1145
01:32:48,487 --> 01:32:51,047
No, you mean
it was company business.

1146
01:32:51,127 --> 01:32:54,836
That's right,
and that's all it was: business.

1147
01:32:59,847 --> 01:33:02,202
Let me tell you somethin',
sweetheart.

1148
01:33:04,327 --> 01:33:06,397
You're very good at your job.

1149
01:33:18,127 --> 01:33:20,880
You mean I was workin'
for a guy from the mailroom?

1150
01:33:20,967 --> 01:33:24,004
- You're not an executive?
- He's too good to be an executive.

1151
01:33:25,087 --> 01:33:26,964
- Disappointed?
- Yes!

1152
01:33:27,047 --> 01:33:29,515
I was having fun on this job.

1153
01:33:29,607 --> 01:33:33,520
You had all this energy,
and all these crazy ideas.

1154
01:33:33,607 --> 01:33:35,563
And you kept takin'
your pants off.

1155
01:33:35,647 --> 01:33:37,842
I don't want you to go.

1156
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:40,605
Here.

1157
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:43,197
Just a little somethin'
to remember me by.

1158
01:33:43,927 --> 01:33:47,044
- Thank you.
- Brantley, why you lookin' so sad?

1159
01:33:47,687 --> 01:33:50,326
I don't know. I just thought
it'd work out better, you know?

1160
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:51,999
The job or the girl?

1161
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:55,885
The job.
To hell with the girl.

1162
01:33:56,487 --> 01:33:59,320
Yeah.
You sound real convincing.

1163
01:34:00,127 --> 01:34:02,357
Well, look at it this way, pal.

1164
01:34:03,447 --> 01:34:07,042
For a few weeks, you sat up here in
the lofty atmosphere of the big cheeses.

1165
01:34:07,127 --> 01:34:10,756
You had a nice view of Manhattan
and a clean lunchroom to eat in.

1166
01:34:10,847 --> 01:34:14,522
Hell, you did more in two months
than most people do in a lifetime.

1167
01:34:15,487 --> 01:34:17,398
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

1168
01:34:18,407 --> 01:34:20,796
The job or the girl?

1169
01:34:28,647 --> 01:34:31,525
- Goin' back to Kansas?
- No, I'm not goin' back to Kansas.

1170
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:33,245
I came to New York to succeed.

1171
01:34:33,327 --> 01:34:35,283
I hear there's an opening
in the mailroom.

1172
01:34:35,367 --> 01:34:38,165
You should talk.
You're just as unemployed as I am.

1173
01:34:38,247 --> 01:34:40,158
Not for long.
I have contacts all over town.

1174
01:34:40,247 --> 01:34:43,205
- There's always another Prescott around.
- Low blow, Foster. Dirty pool.

1175
01:34:43,287 --> 01:34:45,517
- I call 'em like I see 'em.
- Yeah, you're perfect, right?

1176
01:34:45,607 --> 01:34:48,167
- I never slept with the boss.
- No, you slept with the boss's wife.

1177
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:49,600
She seduced me.

1178
01:34:49,687 --> 01:34:51,439
He seduced me.
What's the difference?

1179
01:34:51,527 --> 01:34:53,643
I couldn't help it.
You went willingly.

1180
01:34:53,727 --> 01:34:56,525
- I see. You were tied up in chains.
- I'll tell you what the difference is.

1181
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:58,757
- I thought you were a nice guy.
- I am a nice guy!

1182
01:34:58,847 --> 01:35:00,166
You're a rat!

1183
01:35:00,247 --> 01:35:02,044
You lied to me, deceived me,
then acted as judge and jury...

1184
01:35:02,127 --> 01:35:03,719
in a situation
you knew nothing about.

1185
01:35:03,807 --> 01:35:07,004
- I know you were spying on me.
- I wasn't spying on you!

1186
01:35:07,087 --> 01:35:10,363
- And I won't be spying on you any more!
- No, you won't, 'cause if I see you...

1187
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:20,917
Sorry.
This car is full.

1188
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:28,275
- We could never pull that off.
- How do you know?

1189
01:35:28,367 --> 01:35:30,961
I'm a kid from the mailroom
who moved into a top executive position.

1190
01:35:31,047 --> 01:35:32,765
Are you gonna tell me
I can't pull it off?

1191
01:35:32,847 --> 01:35:34,405
But you didn't.

1192
01:35:34,847 --> 01:35:38,237
I almost did.
We could pull this off.

1193
01:35:40,487 --> 01:35:43,559
- I'm gonna need your help, both of you.
- Is it somethin' I could get fired for?

1194
01:35:43,647 --> 01:35:45,717
- Absolutely.
- I like it.

1195
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:48,526
Jean, see if you can find
Harley McMasters' phone number.

1196
01:35:48,607 --> 01:35:51,041
And get some food up here.
Chinese sound good to you?

1197
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:55,842
Mr Davenport, we realize you'll want
to move some of your own people...

1198
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:59,522
into the medium control
positions here at Pemrose.

1199
01:36:01,847 --> 01:36:03,041
Naturally.

1200
01:36:04,007 --> 01:36:07,761
What we're concerned about, frankly,
is the upper management positions.

1201
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:13,677
- Most of'em will have to go.
- Oh, no.

1202
01:36:15,647 --> 01:36:17,126
I see.

1203
01:36:19,127 --> 01:36:21,436
But a handful of'em...

1204
01:36:22,807 --> 01:36:24,638
who have been so helpful...

1205
01:36:26,647 --> 01:36:28,763
like yourselves, of course...

1206
01:36:29,567 --> 01:36:31,523
will be stayin'
as long as you like.

1207
01:36:33,127 --> 01:36:35,004
Well, then I see nothing
to stand in the way...

1208
01:36:35,087 --> 01:36:37,521
of the immediate merger
of our two companies.

1209
01:36:37,607 --> 01:36:40,519
Is this the place? It is!
Hey, good. Sorry we're late.

1210
01:36:40,607 --> 01:36:44,361
- Get them out of here.
- I'm sorry. This is a private meeting.

1211
01:36:44,447 --> 01:36:47,883
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Hold these, will you? Thanks a lot.

1212
01:36:50,487 --> 01:36:53,160
- Call building security.
- Howard, relax. Listen.

1213
01:36:53,247 --> 01:36:55,238
On behalf of the personnel
in the mailroom...

1214
01:36:55,327 --> 01:36:58,364
the girls in the secretarial pool,
the female executives here at Pemrose...

1215
01:36:58,447 --> 01:37:00,358
we wanted to give our blessing
to this little merger.

1216
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:04,122
- Who in hell are these people?
- Is that Don? Donny!

1217
01:37:04,207 --> 01:37:08,041
How ya doin'? You mind if I stand up?
I think better when I'm movin' around.

1218
01:37:08,127 --> 01:37:09,845
Gotta tell you, Don...

1219
01:37:09,927 --> 01:37:11,838
at first, the idea of this merger
made me as nervous...

1220
01:37:11,927 --> 01:37:14,725
as a long-tailed cat
in a room full of rocking chairs.

1221
01:37:14,807 --> 01:37:17,037
But then I realized
I was wrong.

1222
01:37:17,127 --> 01:37:20,278
The combination of our products
and your distribution capabilities...

1223
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:23,359
could vault Pemrose
right to the top of the market.

1224
01:37:24,327 --> 01:37:26,363
So glad you approve...

1225
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:28,320
whoever you are.

1226
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:30,841
Now if you get the hell out of here,
we'll finish the job.

1227
01:37:31,287 --> 01:37:33,084
I can't do that for you, Don.

1228
01:37:33,887 --> 01:37:36,003
See, the problem here
is management.

1229
01:37:36,967 --> 01:37:39,162
Things were bad enough
when Howard was running the company.

1230
01:37:39,247 --> 01:37:43,365
- Now we got you to deal with too.
- Get them out of here, <i>now.</i>

1231
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:46,519
He can't, Don. You see,
Brantley made arrangements...

1232
01:37:46,607 --> 01:37:48,518
to buy five percent
of the stock...

1233
01:37:48,607 --> 01:37:51,405
in your company,
Davenport Enterprises, this morning.

1234
01:37:52,447 --> 01:37:54,802
- We're buying you out.
- What?

1235
01:37:54,887 --> 01:37:56,605
Get in there!

1236
01:37:57,487 --> 01:37:59,205
That's right!

1237
01:37:59,847 --> 01:38:02,520
We've initiated a takeover
of Davenport Enterprises...

1238
01:38:02,607 --> 01:38:05,280
in a proxy fight
for the Pemrose Corporation.

1239
01:38:05,367 --> 01:38:08,962
- This way, Mr McMasters.
- Gentlemen, good afternoon.

1240
01:38:09,047 --> 01:38:11,322
These are
my financial advisers.

1241
01:38:11,407 --> 01:38:14,319
They agreed to lend me the money
to finance this takeover.

1242
01:38:14,407 --> 01:38:16,967
Surely you're not going to invest
in some crackpot scheme...

1243
01:38:17,047 --> 01:38:20,198
cooked up by a kid
who used to work in our mailroom.

1244
01:38:20,287 --> 01:38:23,518
Not at first, Howie,
but I had an ace in the hole:

1245
01:38:23,607 --> 01:38:26,599
a major stockholder in the company
with the clout and support I needed.

1246
01:38:26,687 --> 01:38:28,678
Don, I want you to meet...

1247
01:38:28,767 --> 01:38:31,679
the new chairperson
of the Pemrose Corporation...

1248
01:38:31,767 --> 01:38:33,883
and the daughter of the founder...

1249
01:38:33,967 --> 01:38:35,719
Vera Prescott.

1250
01:38:38,127 --> 01:38:40,846
Afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1251
01:38:40,927 --> 01:38:42,804
Brantley and I
are very old friends...

1252
01:38:42,887 --> 01:38:45,879
and when he told me his wonderful
ideas for running the company...

1253
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:47,878
I knew he was
the man for the job.

1254
01:38:47,967 --> 01:38:52,358
I think we all understand
your real motivation here, Vera.

1255
01:38:54,247 --> 01:38:56,317
I admit I felt...

1256
01:38:56,407 --> 01:38:59,285
some attraction towards Brantley
at the beginning...

1257
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:01,642
but as you've always
told me, Howard...

1258
01:39:01,727 --> 01:39:03,399
Iove is love...

1259
01:39:03,487 --> 01:39:05,603
but business is business.

1260
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,806
You've run Daddy's company
into the ground, Howard...

1261
01:39:08,887 --> 01:39:12,038
and I believe these people here can
bring it back to where it belongs again.

1262
01:39:12,967 --> 01:39:15,845
Now, up, Howard,
out of that chair.

1263
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:19,678
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not about to resign my position.

1264
01:39:19,767 --> 01:39:23,476
You don't have to, Howard.
You're fired.

1265
01:39:23,567 --> 01:39:25,159
What?

1266
01:39:25,767 --> 01:39:28,076
- Vera, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

1267
01:39:28,167 --> 01:39:30,078
You see, Mr Davenport...

1268
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:34,445
as of this afternoon,
I control 50.1% of the voting stock.

1269
01:39:34,527 --> 01:39:36,643
You, too, Art.
You're history.

1270
01:39:40,127 --> 01:39:43,642
Brantley, Christy,
Jean, Melrose.

1271
01:39:52,407 --> 01:39:54,125
Gentlemen, just in time.

1272
01:39:54,207 --> 01:39:56,880
Mr Prescott and his aide have
disrupted a very important meeting.

1273
01:39:56,967 --> 01:39:58,958
Would you please escort them
out of the building?

1274
01:39:59,047 --> 01:40:01,800
Vera! Why this open hostility?

1275
01:40:01,887 --> 01:40:04,321
I don't understand.
How did you get so...

1276
01:40:04,407 --> 01:40:06,398
Would you take charge of
the meeting now, Brantley?

1277
01:40:06,487 --> 01:40:08,796
- What did I ever do to deserve this?
- Excuse me.

1278
01:40:18,927 --> 01:40:21,316
Feel free to do that
amongst yourselves if you want.

1279
01:40:25,127 --> 01:40:28,358
- So have you been to Kansas?
- No. What's in Kansas?

1280
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:31,962
Well, I figured we'd take
the private Pemrose jet...

1281
01:40:32,047 --> 01:40:34,083
drop in on the folks.

1282
01:40:34,407 --> 01:40:36,318
They're gonna want to meet you.

1283
01:40:39,687 --> 01:40:41,917
Why haven't I
met you before?

1284
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:44,237
Baby, you ain't been hangin' out
in the mailroom.

1285
01:40:44,327 --> 01:40:47,000
The mailroom.
I like that sound.

1286
01:40:54,007 --> 01:40:57,124
Charlie, we got that same problem
with elevator three again.

1287
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:59,277
I don't believe this.

1288
01:41:00,047 --> 01:41:01,765
This elevator's stuck again.

1289
01:42:02,607 --> 01:42:05,440
- Where to, sir?
- The opera, Rattigan.

1290
01:42:05,527 --> 01:42:07,961
Yes, sir.
