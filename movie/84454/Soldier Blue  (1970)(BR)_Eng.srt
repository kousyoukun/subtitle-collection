1
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,900
( Buffy Saint-Marie sings Soldier Blue )

2
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:21,919
Tell you a story, and it's a true one

3
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:25,464
And I'll tell it like you'll understand

4
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,874
And I ain't gonna talk
like some history man

5
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:38,733
I look out and I see a land

6
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Young and lovely,
hard and strong

7
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,492
For fifteen thousand years
we've danced her praises

8
00:01:54,535 --> 00:02:02,535
Payed our thanks
and we've just begun

9
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:10,247
This, this is my country

10
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:17,958
Young and growin'
free and flowin', sea to sea

11
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:22,634
Yes, this is my country

12
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:29,823
Ripe and bearing
miracles in every pond and tree

13
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:35,492
I can stand upon a hill at dawn

14
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,367
Look all around me,
feel her surround me

15
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:46,546
Soldier Blue,
can't you see her life has just begun?

16
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:53,802
It's beating inside us,
telling us she's here to guide us

17
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,254
Ooh, Soldier Blue, Soldier Blue

18
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:06,499
Can't you see that there's
another way to love her?

19
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:16,880
Yes, this is my country

20
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:23,787
I sprang from her and
I'm learnin' how to count upon her

21
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:29,622
Tall trees and
the corn is high country

22
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:35,992
Yes, I love her and
I'm learnin' how to take care of her

23
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:42,054
Ooh, Soldier Blue, Soldier Blue

24
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:48,269
Can't you see that there's
another way to love her?

25
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:55,195
Soldier Blue... Soldier Blue...

26
00:03:55,228 --> 00:04:03,228
Can't you see that there's
another way to love her?

27
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,837
Stupid frilly hat!

28
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:42,017
Honus...
Hey, Honus!

29
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,740
- Did you see 'em?

30
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,676
Did you see the
shape of them boobs?

31
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:48,797
Well? Well, where is she?
Where's the woman?

32
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,060
Ah... What the devil?

33
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,812
Who put here in there?

34
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:58,376
She's yours Captain,
you've got her

35
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:02,856
Bitch!

36
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:27,776
Detail...
Forward, ho!

37
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,800
Look at her, settin' in there...

38
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,394
Two years captive with them red bucks...
Don't it make you wonder though?

39
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:24,768
What?

40
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,098
How many of 'em got to her...
Don't it get you all worked up?

41
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,779
Wade... sometimes you
talk like a pervert...

42
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:32,508
Me?

43
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,689
It's not her fault the
Cheyenne grabbed her...

44
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:38,311
Well, I'm not sayin' it is, but...
by guff...

45
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,568
I'd sure like to get my hands
on some of that...

46
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:43,102
You can keep your hands to yourself
when we get to Fort Reunion...

47
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,090
- Why?
- He's waiting for her there...

48
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:46,942
- Who?
Her financée...

49
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,201
Spingarn!

50
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,466
Spingarn!

51
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,433
We need flankers...

52
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,038
Sir?

53
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,212
You ought to put out some flankers.

54
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:11,810
Are you advising me Captain?
Me?

55
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:14,137
Huh?
I'm only the Pay Master...

56
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:19,089
You get no 'advice' from me soldier.
I'm telling you... put out some flankers.

57
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,358
(chortles) What're you afraid of Sir?
Road agents?

58
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:23,749
Cheyenne!

59
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:26,509
(chortles) Excuse me Cap'n,
but I ain't heard yet

60
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,336
about no Injuns comin'
after a Pay Master's detail.

61
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,554
- They got no use for that money chest.
- Flankers!

62
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,041
Yes Sir.

63
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:40,814
Get...

64
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:47,309
All right... I guess we're out far enough.

65
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:49,865
Why pick on us?

66
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:51,669
Why not?

67
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:57,082
Just getting up real close...
you can almost see her...

68
00:08:57,267 --> 00:09:00,418
you could take your hand...
and you could put it right around...

69
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,859
one of her pretty little ankles.

70
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,562
You could Honus...
an' you're a snot nose...

71
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,174
You're a good friend...
the best friend I ever had...

72
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,883
but you're snot nosed and
you always will be...

73
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,404
Willie!

74
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:33,129
Take cover!
Take cover!

75
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,164
Spingarn...
you stupid son of a bitch...

76
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,023
Dismount!
Take cover and fire at will...

77
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:13,314
Oh, my God...

78
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:20,500
Lieutenant, the woman...
the woman!

79
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:23,271
Get up.

80
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:30,035
Stupid... cocking...
murdering bastards...

81
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,681
Imbeciles...
the American....

82
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,675
fire you...
now I advise you to try to control...

83
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:36,453
I told you...

84
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:40,680
Oh my God...
we're the last...

85
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,497
We can treat with them...

86
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,992
- What?
- White flag!

87
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:45,930
Talk to them...
we can make 'em listen!

88
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:48,568
Captain, those bloody butchers want
nothing more than our hides.

89
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:51,850
I'm gonna talk to them...
I'm gonna talk to them...

90
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,348
Captain... come back here!
- You Indians... No Kill...

91
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,142
No kill...

92
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,741
Aiii!

93
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,138
Iaiii!

94
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,271
Fire! ...Fire!
Woods are on fire...

95
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,479
Fire!

96
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,879
Won't take 'em long now...

97
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,432
Hey!
Hey, up here...

98
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:48,478
come on!

99
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,359
Come on!

100
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,926
Well, don't just stand there...
Get your ass up here!

101
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,505
Gee...
You it!

102
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,352
What?

103
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,382
You all that's coming?
- I don't know...

104
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,562
Well, follow me!

105
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,040
Wait!

106
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,623
Hey! Get down...
come on...

107
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,181
Well, there goes the wagon...

108
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,257
They'll be looking for us.

109
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,164
Nah.

110
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,896
Not for long.
Not him!

111
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:01,236
Not who?

112
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,127
Spotted Wolf!

113
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,023
In case you didn't know what hit you,
they're Cheyenne...

114
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:11,584
How can you tell
it's Spotted Wolf?

115
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,233
I saw him.

116
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:14,740
You know him by sight?

117
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,225
I know him.

118
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,492
What's your name?

119
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:23,794
Honus Gent.

120
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,555
Cresta Maribel Lee.

121
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,477
Are you wounded there?
- What? Are you wounded?

122
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:32,661
Oh? .. No...
that's not my blood

123
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,700
Good 'cause we've
got a long wait.

124
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:40,945
They are gonna be messin' with
those bodies down there for hours.

125
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:47,419
- Ah, what do you doing?
- I'm takin' off my pants.

126
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:49,796
Why?

127
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:52,821
'Cause it's hotter than
hell an' they're ichin'...

128
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:55,216
Oh...

129
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:02,995
Ahh... We'd better take it easy...
get comfortable...(sighs)

130
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,826
I sure as hell wish
I hadn't lost my hat.

131
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,390
Ah...
Miss?

132
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:10,720
Huh?

133
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:15,861
About Spotted Wolf?
How do you? ah...

134
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,277
I'm his wife...

135
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:21,368
Oh...

136
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,614
Hey, look here,...

137
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,892
come on....

138
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,041
Hey what're you doing there?

139
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:25,954
(sobs)
nothing...

140
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,604
Look, I don't want to
rush you soldier,

141
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,290
but it's going to be dark
in a couple of hours...

142
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,708
and we can't hang around here.

143
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,591
You're... you're robbing the dead...

144
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,144
My God...
You're robbing the dead!

145
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,332
Yep! Well I sure as
hell ain't getting much.

146
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:06,767
A little hard tack mostly,
but that'll keep...

147
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,518
us going for a while...
You find anything better?

148
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,227
My God...

149
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,509
- It was you...
- Me?

150
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,059
- He was looking for you!
- What the hell are you talking about?

151
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,133
Spotted Wolf...
He was out to bring you back.

152
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,514
- Bull shit!
- The Cheyennes would..

153
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:39,141
- What?
- You heard me. I've nothing to do with it.

154
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,247
- The Cheyennes would never
attack a Pay Master's detail...

155
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:43,281
Bull shit!

156
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:49,677
He was looking for you!
- Ah, he wouldn't trouble himself...

157
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:54,892
Don't flatter me, Soldier Blue...
I'm not worth any chest of gold.

158
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,892
They've got no use for gold.

159
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,592
Well, what the hell do you think
they were fighting with?

160
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:04,717
Rifles cost money, see...
and if you don't believe me...

161
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:09,107
then try and find the pay chest...
go ahead... find it!

162
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,907
Any more questions?

163
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:48,094
- I want to say something...
- Yea? well hang on to it, we're leaving...

164
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:49,927
For them!

165
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:51,343
Huh?

166
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:54,976
Something must be said for them.

167
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:56,672
(sighs)

168
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:01,850
You mean a kind of service, huh?
Ah, what the hell; go ahead.

169
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,029
Should be a prayer.
- Right! A prayer...

170
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,924
I bet you know a hundred prayers.

171
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,550
I should be here.

172
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:15,097
Huh?

173
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,125
I should be here,
lying with them, with my company.

174
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:25,004
Why? I mean, you've come out pretty good
it seems to me. See...

175
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:28,044
they're all lying here dead,
and you're still walking.

176
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:35,044
- Murdering savages...
- Yeh, you go right ahead.

177
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:38,552
You can howl at the
moon if you want to,

178
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:40,704
but it's not going to get
us back to Fort Reunion.

179
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:44,605
Now, you say your something,
or let's get the hell out of here.

180
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,312
Theirs not to make reply,

181
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,211
Theirs not to reason why,

182
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:24,793
Theirs but to do and die,

183
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,346
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred,

184
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,152
Storm'd at with shot and shell,

185
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:37,803
Boldly they rode and well,

186
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:40,830
Into the jaws of...

187
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,591
of Death,

188
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,784
Into the mouth of Hell

189
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:49,603
Rode the six hundred.

190
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:54,701
Flash'd all their sabres bare,

191
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,475
Flash'd as they turn'd in air,

192
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:05,979
Charging an army, while
All the world wonder'd:

193
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,900
Theirs not to reason why,

194
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,641
Theirs but to do and die:

195
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,410
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

196
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,602
Jesus.

197
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:42,881
(Cresta humming)

198
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,205
Throw them out.

199
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,299
What?

200
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:16,592
Your socks.
Why do you bother?

201
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:44,055
Here...

202
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,556
(gagging sounds)

203
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:50,905
What's the matter?

204
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:53,884
- It's mud!
- It's a little dirty...

205
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:56,850
- Where's the canteen?
- Oh, no...

206
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:01,167
You're not gonna' touch something that was
robbed from the dead, are you?

207
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,926
All right...

208
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:09,171
- We might be needing them later.
- That's using your head Soldier Blue.

209
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,696
Would you like some more mud?

210
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:22,989
Isn't it...
Can't you do something with that dress?

211
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:27,285
- Huh?
- Can't you... pull it together some way?

212
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:31,330
Couple of days, I'll lose a few pounds...
I won't be showin' through so much...

213
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:34,576
It never did fit me anyway...
one of hers...

214
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,589
Whose?

215
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:41,592
That woman at the Snake Flats agency...
Right off, she stripped me down naked....

216
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:44,136
stuck me in a tub, and gave me
this here dress.

217
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:49,313
Hey! Hey, did you see the hat?

218
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,642
Big bright yellow hat she gave me...
covered my whole face.

219
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:58,660
I did love that hat, though.
I'm sick at heart about losin' that...

220
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:01,874
- Sick at heart...
- You can say that now!

221
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,431
What's the matter?
What'd I say

222
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:08,908
21 men lying dead back there and you
sit here mourning a yellow hat.

223
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:12,387
- 21 men!
- A drop in the old bucket.

224
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:15,401
- A what?
- It's not the army, Soldier Blue...

225
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,582
They're not the ones getting killed off...

226
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,222
In this damn fool country...

227
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:22,758
Our country, Miss Lee,
is neither damned or foolish...

228
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:24,303
Balls!

229
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,251
Mrs. Lee, you have a most
profane way of speaking...

230
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:30,766
You should hear me in Cheyenne.
Do you want to?

231
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:32,199
(speaks in Cheyenne)

232
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,724
- No!

233
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:37,391
Good brave lads comin' out here
to kill themselves a real live injun...

234
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,817
puttin' up their forts in
a country they've got no claim to...

235
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:44,813
So what the hell do you expect the
indians to do? Sit back on their butts...

236
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,633
while the army take's
over their land

237
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:49,504
You saw for yourself what they
did, taking off scalps...

238
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:52,891
Yea, and who taught them that little trick?
The white man!

239
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,647
And cutting off hands
and cutting off feet and cutting off...

240
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:03,088
I know what they cut off, but at least they
don't make tobacco pouches out of them...

241
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,168
uhah... that's something else
you soldier boy's made up...

242
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:07,202
You're lying.

243
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:12,192
You ever seen an Indian camp
after the army's been there?

244
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:16,982
Huh? You ever see the women and what was
done to them before they where killed?

245
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:22,977
Ever see the little boys
and girls stuck on the long knifes?

246
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,342
Huh?
Stuck and dying?

247
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:30,749
Well, I have.

248
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:32,735
Fine.

249
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:39,832
Go to sleep.

250
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,210
You're lying.

251
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:18,514
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the
hillside... Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...

252
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:26,801
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the
hillside... Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...

253
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:35,137
(singing) Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey... A few
more jumps and I'll be with him... Hey, ho...

254
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:52,271
I'll tell you about that hat... that hat
was just like the one my Daddy gave me...

255
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:59,707
on a Sunday morning a long time ago,
he knelt down and he kissed me...

256
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:06,161
then he put that hat on my head.
That's the last I ever saw of him.

257
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:10,727
- You mean he died?
- Hell no, he ran off and left me...

258
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,259
put me in an orphanage on Canal Street.

259
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:19,292
Eh... what the hell. Whoever asked to
get themselves born anyway... huh? Who?

260
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,450
- I'm going a sleep.
- You do that soldier...

261
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:27,039
and you try to keep your mind off me...

262
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:31,140
- Miss Lee, I certainly have at no...
- Oh, I know...

263
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:34,086
If you get too all-fired
horny during the night...

264
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:38,217
just, ah...
go soak your head in the stream over there.

265
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:58,068
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the
hillside... Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...

266
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:06,594
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the
hillside... Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...

267
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:32,771
Well...

268
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,873
That's it...
Over there...

269
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,806
What?
- The old Garvey wagon road.

270
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,987
Oh, what about it?
- We'll be sticking close to it.

271
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,780
Why?

272
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:08,108
Well it's a straight shoot
right into Fort Reunion...

273
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,026
Maybe, uh, four days at the most

274
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:14,980
There we are,
right out there in the open...

275
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:18,385
and there they come...
a-whooping it, out of nowhere.

276
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:23,017
They'll have us hanging feet high,
and let the crows pluck out our eyes.

277
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:27,215
You may not be aware, Miss Cresta Lee,

278
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,636
but I'm a professional
soldier, and I happen to

279
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:33,433
be well experienced in
this part of the country

280
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:37,058
How long have they kept you
private, Private...

281
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,592
No one's kept me, Miss Lee.
It was my father's wish...

282
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:44,132
You take that road,
Soldier Blue, and you'll

283
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:46,865
get your father coming
out here to bury you.

284
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:50,747
My father's dead.

285
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:55,553
He was killed at Little Big Horn,
last year... murdered by the Sioux...

286
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:01,262
I wonder if that General Custer
took your father's advice...

287
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,069
well, it's a sure thing
I ain't takin' yours...

288
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:10,810
Listen, you keep the rifle...

289
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:15,153
the jerky you can have,
just give me some of this hard tack...

290
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,964
There, there we are...

291
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:22,129
good luck, Soldier Blue, I'll tell
them at the Fort it wasn't my fault...

292
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,982
Hey, Private Gent!

293
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:01,335
Miss Lee!

294
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:25,861
- Well... get lost?
- Couldn't do it!

295
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,557
- Huh?
- Leaving you all alone...

296
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,837
I couldn't forgive myself...
if something happened to you.

297
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:37,260
Well... thank you!

298
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:38,564
Heh!

299
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:41,485
What could I say to your financée...

300
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,949
Oh!
You know about him, huh?

301
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,968
How could I face him?
How could I look him in the eye?

302
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,468
Yeh, I see.... A soldier's duty for
another soldier, and to hell with me.

303
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,687
A matter of principle, Miss Lee....

304
00:34:57,692 --> 00:35:02,023
It's a matter of crap.
Have some berries...

305
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:04,592
Berries make me sick.

306
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:08,049
Well, Christ...
Naah!

307
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:16,214
(series of sighs and groans)

308
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,843
(coughing)

309
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:21,271
(sighs)

310
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:25,216
Look at that, another rip.

311
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:26,992
God dammit.

312
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,923
- Do you talk in front of him that way?
- Who?

313
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:32,292
Your fiancée?

314
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:34,363
Huh!

315
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:36,665
That's a funny thing, you know...
We don't talk.

316
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:39,463
I can't remember one
conversation we ever had...

317
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:44,014
He'd just grab hold...
and I'd hold off, and...

318
00:35:44,531 --> 00:35:46,353
Thank goodness I held off long enough...

319
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,063
So he, uh, joined the army...
Boy, that did it....

320
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,968
six long months at Fort Reunion,
and no women...

321
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:00,886
I was sent for, to come out
and have a military wedding.

322
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,823
Here I am, still trying to get there.

323
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,205
You sure he's still waiting?
- He said so in the telegraph.

324
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,946
The way you put it, well...

325
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:15,956
Uh... A person gets the idea
you're marrying him for money.

326
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:17,948
Yeh, I am!

327
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:30,054
(gasping)

328
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,450
(groans)

329
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:38,578
(sighs)

330
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:44,553
Lose something?

331
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,717
My sock.
- Awww.

332
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:51,680
- It's gone!
- I'll tell you soldier...

333
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,655
It's gonna cut your washing in half.

334
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:58,270
- I'm going back a way...
- You're not! It won't take but a moment...

335
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:03,592
I promise I won't report you
for being out of uniform.

336
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:09,555
Jesus Christ...

337
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:14,767
(splashing sounds)

338
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:20,513
A hundred miles ahead of us, and
you're going back... back!

339
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:27,082
What the hell am I doing...
Twenty-one soldiers, and I get you!

340
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:23,606
Don't touch it. Don't you lay a
finger on that rifle! You hear me?

341
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:26,432
It's hidden there under the jacket...
You just let it stay like that...

342
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,544
- Cheyenne?
- Kiowa!

343
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:33,468
Oh! - And they want to kill
us, but not too quick...

344
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,591
Where'd they come from...
- From one lousy sock.

345
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:40,924
- Well, we've got to do something.
- You can watch...

346
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:43,456
What're you talking about?

347
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:47,551
They're going to rape me Soldier Blue...
and then they're gonna kill us afterwards.

348
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,087
Oh, my God!

349
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:57,158
(speaking in Cheyenne)

350
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:15,670
- Did I see you?
- I spit..

351
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,276
- Well, how could you?
- Ssshhh...

352
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:20,608
(speaking in Kiowa)

353
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,281
- What;s going on?
- I insulted them...

354
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,690
Oh no!

355
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:27,926
I told them they were five old women...

356
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:29,668
I said that they were afraid of you...

357
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:32,592
that you were tall and strong
and feared nothing...

358
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,826
You...

359
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:36,681
(speaking Kiowa)

360
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:42,373
Wait... don't pick it up...
take off your clothes...

361
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:47,055
Not me! Look at him, Soldier Blue.
He can move twice as fast as you can...

362
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,483
in those stupid army pants.
Take 'em off!

363
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,634
I can't fight my long johns...

364
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:53,425
Take them of too!

365
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,890
He can hold you with them.

366
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:00,530
Look, it's my life as well as yours...
You want to kill us both? Take them off!

367
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,563
- I can't!
- Take 'em off!

368
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:04,731
- No!
- You bastard!

369
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:07,707
Shut up!

370
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,487
(speaking Kiowa)

371
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:32,905
(laughing)

372
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:35,114
(groans)

373
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,012
Kill him!

374
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:41,640
You've won.
They expect you to kill him.

375
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,097
(speaking in Kiowa)

376
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:19,368
(speaking in Kiowa)

377
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:31,617
Hey Honus!
You did it!

378
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:33,900
You did it!

379
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,529
Honus!

380
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:58,609
Hey, Honus... wait for me!

381
00:43:03,906 --> 00:43:04,906
Honus!

382
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,787
Honus...
Wait up!

383
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,802
Wha... what're you doing?

384
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:48,517
I'm freezing my ass off...

385
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:53,341
You... you can't sleep here.

386
00:43:53,835 --> 00:43:55,093
Why not?

387
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:59,003
Well... I'm here...

388
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:03,911
Turn over and close your eyes,
we'll be warm in no time.

389
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,962
Honus what're you doing?

390
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:11,588
(sighs) I can't!

391
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,831
You can't what?

392
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:17,568
I can't do it.

393
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,516
What do you want to do, Honus?

394
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:30,905
Oh man...
Take it! You take it...

395
00:46:07,483 --> 00:46:11,184
(gasps in excitement)

396
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:14,774
(goat bleating)

397
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:26,370
(panting)

398
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,313
I want the rifle Honus...

399
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:30,188
What for?

400
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:32,452
It's a goat..

401
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:33,846
What?

402
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:36,718
Honest to God, it is a real live goat...

403
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,865
Now don't argue with me...
give me the rifle

404
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,775
I want to see for myself...

405
00:46:41,893 --> 00:46:43,773
Oh, no... Honus!

406
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:55,885
- Give me that rifle...
- Sshh, you'll scare him...

407
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,919
He can hear is and you're
gonna miss him by three hills...

408
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:00,576
- I'll get him...
- You'll miss him...

409
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,082
I'll get him...

410
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:18,966
(goat bleats)

411
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:25,518
He's gone...

412
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:28,036
(Honus sighs)

413
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:33,677
Look, you dumb gun soldier...
he's gone.

414
00:47:33,822 --> 00:47:37,857
You stupid, beardless, tenderfoot!

415
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:45,738
I hope you choke on berries... Do you
hear me? I hope you throw up all night.

416
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:47,451
Owwww!

417
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:50,200
Miss Lee...

418
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,627
Cresta...

419
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:24,120
- Brain shot... dead on.
- Oh, oh Honus...

420
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:26,152
It's beautiful...

421
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,282
Oh, Honus...

422
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:52,031
(burps)

423
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:59,833
I've got to tell you the truth, Honus...
He was a tough old bastard...

424
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:05,232
- Please, I've asked you not to...
- All right, all right, I'm sorry.

425
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:09,295
- It's not that I'm a prude or anyth...
- Oh, I know you're not, Honus...

426
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:10,683
I've really gotta be more careful.

427
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,572
(burps)

428
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,463
Well, I guess it's time we turned in.

429
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:25,758
Honus...

430
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,298
it's stupid...

431
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:34,375
you over there,
and me over here...

432
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:37,537
Honus?

433
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,058
All right, I guess you're right.

434
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:35,846
Honus...

435
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:37,713
will you be all right...
I mean...

436
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:39,876
- I know what you mean...
- Will you?

437
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,229
I'll make it...
some how...

438
00:50:44,615 --> 00:50:46,615
Listen, I'll try not to move much...

439
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:50,256
- That'll help.
- I will...

440
00:50:56,692 --> 00:50:57,692
smells like rain...

441
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,067
Well, there isn't a cloud in the sky.

442
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:08,169
'Night, Honus.

443
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:10,574
Good night, Miss Lee.

444
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,060
Shut up!

445
00:51:43,178 --> 00:51:44,246
It's a white man's fire...

446
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:47,351
How do you know?

447
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:50,741
It's different from a red man's fire...

448
00:51:51,865 --> 00:51:52,865
Oh.

449
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,632
Gosh Almighty!

450
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:40,265
I hope you'll forgive the intrusion sir...

451
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:50,243
I'm Private Honus Gent,
of the Calorado 11th Cavalry...

452
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:51,842
Lord, declare...

453
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:53,397
and uh...

454
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:56,897
this young lady is Miss
Cresta Lee, from New York City...

455
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,335
- So 'tis, so 'tis...
- We're trying to get to Fort Reunion.

456
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:07,250
You see, uh... my troop was
wiped out by the Cheyenne...

457
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:10,837
- Devils... Devils...
- It was a Pay Master's escort...

458
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,592
and Miss Lee had joined us
to meet her Fiancée...

459
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,234
Good... hah... good for you...

460
00:53:17,129 --> 00:53:18,129
yeh...

461
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:20,961
Where is your guns?

462
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:23,798
- Guns?
- Guns... you're the hunting type?

463
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:27,851
Oh no...
Uh, we lost our rifle in the flood...

464
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,718
Hey! That was a ripple, wasn't it?

465
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,924
Come near drownin' my two
beauties, there...

466
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:34,805
They been 16 years with Isaac Cumber.

467
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:37,244
Huh... Heh...

468
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,486
I'm pleased to meet you Mr. Cumber...

469
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,109
Isaac Q...
the Q part was my daddy's joke...

470
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:45,868
being as he calls me Cumber...
sayin' Q Cumber...

471
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,799
(both laugh)

472
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:51,332
but I kinda like it...
(laughs)...

473
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:52,582
Oh.

474
00:53:53,656 --> 00:53:57,403
That's a... quite a wagon...
you... travel in style

475
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,502
Yeh, I do, ah, I surely do...

476
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:03,690
I got grub and tools and
blankets and, ah, bolts of calico...

477
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:07,113
- Just in case...
- In case of Indians, huh?

478
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:08,856
Take a look...

479
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:14,304
Take a look in these eyes, Soldier.
That's honesty you see there...

480
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:16,555
hard rock honesty!

481
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,681
I treats 'em fair,
and I treats 'em square...

482
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,651
and they don't fool none with Isaac Q!

483
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:24,545
What about hostiles?

484
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,790
Hostiles!
'Ya think I trade with hostiles?

485
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:30,347
Devils...
Devils...

486
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:34,273
Hey, you look kinda' peek'd, Missy...

487
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:36,253
You don't talk much, huh?

488
00:54:36,296 --> 00:54:38,457
Well, that's alright...
A man would rather look at a woman than...

489
00:54:38,481 --> 00:54:40,347
talk to her, any day,
and you... uh...

490
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:42,336
I can see more of you right now...

491
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,639
than I seen of my wife in 27 years...

492
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:46,227
God rest her soul...

493
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,128
her frosty-faced soul.

494
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,305
- We could use some food, Mr. Cumber.
- Yea, you could, you surely could.

495
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:57,234
I'm ah... I'm partial to rabbit, myself.

496
00:54:58,237 --> 00:54:59,237
That'd be fine.

497
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,504
If you don't mind,
I could use some of your calico.

498
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:03,174
Help yourself...
in back of the wagon

499
00:55:03,902 --> 00:55:05,685
- Are we met?
- What?

500
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:09,692
- I get the feeling we met...
- No, I don't think so.

501
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:12,669
(chuckles)

502
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,799
In my rucksack, help
yourself, good lye soap...

503
00:55:15,824 --> 00:55:18,523
you can, uh, scrub each other
off, or, uh...

504
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:21,622
whatever else you have a mind to...
(chortles)

505
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,652
Are you sure you haven't met him before?

506
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:34,690
- I'm sure!
- Think about it...

507
00:55:34,691 --> 00:55:35,691
- Why?

508
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:38,111
- Because there's something wrong.
- What?

509
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:40,364
I don't know...

510
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:41,957
The man's a Devil, right?

511
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:45,284
- He's a pots trader, right?
- Yeh, is something wrong?

512
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,764
Pots traders don't go
out looking for gold...

513
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:51,325
- And especially not in Indian country...
- So he wants to get rich quick...

514
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,319
- Who doesn't?
- Well, uh, I still think...

515
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:57,836
Oh no! Please don't think!
Not now!

516
00:55:57,963 --> 00:56:00,703
- We have got food and a nice warm fire...
- What if he... uh...

517
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,420
Wait a minute...

518
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:07,567
How do we know you didn't meet
through Spotted Wolf's camp?

519
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,092
- He doesn't trade with hostile Devils...
- That could be it...

520
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:13,775
- Trading with the Cheyenne....
- Bolts of cloth?

521
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:16,058
I mean guns...
Rifles...

522
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:18,521
Well, there's the wagon...
Go look for 'em...

523
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:53,195
Ah... eh!

524
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:01,434
- 'Ya like it?
- It's different.

525
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:06,890
Boy Honus, you sure know
how to flatter a girl...

526
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:09,450
'Must be a born gift...

527
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:12,676
They must be hidden somewhere else!

528
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,027
- You know the type tal...
- Here...

529
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:17,863
- What?
- Take a bath.

530
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:22,915
Listen to me... that old man is trading
off rifles for the pay cheques we had...

531
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,782
Honus, if I'm gonna look different,
you might as well smell different...

532
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:26,726
now take the soap...

533
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:28,449
maybe it's got a false bottom...

534
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,138
- I'm going to take a look...
- No!

535
00:57:31,174 --> 00:57:33,174
Right now, before he get's back...

536
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,894
- No!
- Oh, get out of my way...

537
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,576
Honus, you've got no right...

538
00:57:36,692 --> 00:57:41,095
(sounds of argument)

539
00:57:41,143 --> 00:57:44,047
Get down!
Get off me!

540
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:45,770
Stop it!

541
00:57:56,085 --> 00:58:01,655
(sighs, then sniffs and sighs again)

542
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:05,364
You've known it all along...

543
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:08,469
The rifles are inside...

544
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:10,968
and you have met him before...

545
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:12,209
Twice...

546
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:13,938
selling guns!

547
00:58:15,223 --> 00:58:16,200
Yes.

548
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,025
- To the Cheyenne...
- Yes!

549
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:20,536
To kill American soldiers...

550
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:22,920
and you wouldn't stop him?

551
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,810
I couldn't then...
I wouldn't now!

552
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,710
What?

553
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,154
For your own people?

554
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:31,679
Most people I know
live in New York City...

555
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:34,565
- For your country then...
- Whose country then?

556
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:37,653
This isn't my country...
we're in Indian country.

557
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:41,168
OK...

558
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:42,499
Why?

559
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:45,222
Tell me, why did you
ever leave the Cheyenne?

560
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:48,133
All right... you really want know?

561
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:49,947
Because they tallk different...

562
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,536
they dress different...
and they eat different...

563
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:56,752
because I am not a Cheyenne,
Solider Blue, and I never will be...

564
00:58:56,889 --> 00:58:59,813
but I can tell you right now
that I'd rather be one...

565
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,882
than any rump butt soldier...

566
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,693
of any blood thirsty
army you can name!

567
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:07,895
You're a traitor, Miss Lee.

568
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:12,753
Well... at least that's settled!

569
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:57,476
Cresta?

570
01:00:00,649 --> 01:00:03,903
Got a good look, did you?
I thought you would.

571
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:09,526
Where is she?
Clunkered! Got her with my rifle butt...

572
01:00:09,846 --> 01:00:11,383
over there, by the fire.

573
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,999
Don't worry soldier... She ain't
marked now and that won't show a bit.

574
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:22,177
(Cumber singing) I've got a heart full
of love For every star in the sky,

575
01:00:22,178 --> 01:00:28,578
(Cumber singing) I've got a heart full
of love For every bird on the wing,

576
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:34,626
(Cumber singing) I've got a heart full
of love For every bird that can sing,

577
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:42,646
(Cumber singing) 'Tellin' you, I've got a heart
full of love That wants to get up and fly...

578
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:48,899
(chortles)

579
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,903
(singing continues)

580
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:54,194
(Cresta grunts)

581
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,469
(Cresta) Bite it...

582
01:00:56,948 --> 01:00:57,978
(Honus) What?

583
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:01,139
(Cresta) Use your teeth...

584
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,719
(Honus groans)

585
01:01:03,379 --> 01:01:10,196
(various groans)

586
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,310
(Cresta) Not there!

587
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,130
(Cresa) Honus?

588
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:27,631
(Cresta) What're you doing?

589
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:35,690
(various groans and sighs)

590
01:01:39,258 --> 01:01:40,258
(Cresta) Oww!

591
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:42,876
(Honus) Sorry!

592
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,502
(Cresta) Never mind... keep at it!

593
01:01:46,005 --> 01:01:47,045
(Honus) Are you all right?

594
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:48,373
(Cresta) Eww!

595
01:01:48,578 --> 01:01:49,785
(Cresta) Eeww!

596
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,215
(loud bang)

597
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:19,707
Look at it, would ya!
Nature's wonderland. (chortles)

598
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:24,742
Out here I feel I'm close
to the great secret of life itself.

599
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,124
Honest to God, ah...

600
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:31,533
I get sort of choked up inside...
(chortles)

601
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:33,232
- Maggot!
- Eh... what?

602
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,627
I called you a Maggot!

603
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,799
A maggot?
(chortles)

604
01:02:39,307 --> 01:02:41,029
Heh, heh!
Maggot!

605
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:45,225
Huh, the tiniest creature
in God's universe...

606
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:48,558
and which one of us is any better?
You? Me? Him?

607
01:02:48,794 --> 01:02:52,474
I wouldn't count on it. There's only
one thing certain right now Missy...

608
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:55,649
pretty soon you're gonna be
back in the arms of your loved one, and...

609
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:59,199
you can bet ol' Spotted Wolf is gonna be
just a-itchin' to get his hands on you...

610
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:01,687
Are you planning to starve us for...

611
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:05,008
If I know Spotted Wolf, he's gonna want
somethin' real plump to get his hands on...

612
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,047
Hah, Hah, how about it Missy?

613
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,464
What about a juicy rump steak? Huh?

614
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:14,766
Heh, heh... ought to be a young pronghorn
around here somewheres...

615
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:16,148
heh, heh...

616
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:26,844
You got any sweet nothin's left, soldier,
you'd better say 'em now. (chortles)

617
01:03:27,632 --> 01:03:30,956
- Quick! Come on, get at 'em!
- I can't!

618
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:33,673
Why not? - I haven't got any
spit left to chew with...

619
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,310
Chew dry!
Come on!

620
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:48,609
That's it!

621
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:52,011
Come on!

622
01:03:54,224 --> 01:03:55,484
It's coming, I can feel it!

623
01:03:55,884 --> 01:03:56,884
A little harder...

624
01:03:57,933 --> 01:03:59,325
Pull!
Pull!

625
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:00,030
Good!

626
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,396
(grunts)

627
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:04,345
Come on Honus!

628
01:04:05,725 --> 01:04:06,725
It's coming...

629
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:07,547
Pull!

630
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:10,441
A little...
I got it Honus!

631
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:11,972
(sighs)

632
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:27,626
- Give me your feet, soldier...
- What?

633
01:04:28,024 --> 01:04:32,172
I'll cut your feet loose, but that's all...
Then we get right out of here.

634
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:33,577
What about the guns?

635
01:04:33,848 --> 01:04:35,270
They stay where they are.

636
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:37,485
You're going to let him
bring those guns in now,

637
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,895
when you know what
they will be used for?

638
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:41,349
I'm giving the Cheyenne
something to keep them alive...

639
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:45,788
Nobody's going to murder them. They'll
be given land, a place to live in peace...

640
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Bull shit!

641
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:49,121
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose.

642
01:04:49,142 --> 01:04:51,528
Not your hands, just your feet.

643
01:06:06,116 --> 01:06:08,939
He's got the only saddle...
we'll have to ride out bareback...

644
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,285
What the hell are you doing?

645
01:06:23,131 --> 01:06:25,289
What do you want? A medal?

646
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:26,827
Come on!

647
01:06:49,033 --> 01:06:50,033
Get up!

648
01:07:06,927 --> 01:07:07,927
Get up!

649
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,717
Get the horse!

650
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,813
- Ahh!
- Honus?

651
01:07:55,095 --> 01:07:56,878
Honus!
Come on, get up here.

652
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:57,748
You can make it.

653
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:02,084
- Ride! Go on, get out of here...
- Get up here you son of a bitch...

654
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,513
Get up boy!

655
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:03,268
Get up!

656
01:09:06,507 --> 01:09:07,507
Giah!

657
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:18,140
Look... ooh.

658
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:19,692
Oh, eh!

659
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:24,224
(sighs)

660
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:28,049
(loud sigh)

661
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:31,939
(groans)

662
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:35,598
(winces)

663
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,399
(loud sigh)

664
01:09:42,033 --> 01:09:43,072
(groans)

665
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:47,467
Get up!
Get up!

666
01:09:49,874 --> 01:09:50,874
(groans)

667
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:54,935
Honus we gotta to keep going.
(groaning)

668
01:09:55,443 --> 01:09:58,353
Honus, he's following us.

669
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:33,586
Hang on, dammit...
Hang on!

670
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:59,439
Whoa, come back here, come on back...
Wait!

671
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:43,969
(grunting)

672
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:39,762
(singing to self)

673
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:30,386
(groaning)
Honus, shut up...

674
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:38,577
for God's sake...
Shut up, dammit! (groaning)

675
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:37,742
(crickets chirping)

676
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,518
How's your leg?

677
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:05,081
Still moves!

678
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,644
You're lucky...
That bullet went clean through.

679
01:16:10,592 --> 01:16:14,520
- It's my, ah, head that hurts.
- Oh?

680
01:16:16,629 --> 01:16:20,205
Here... I want you to eat some of these...
It'll make you feel better.

681
01:16:27,445 --> 01:16:33,333
It's good... What is it?
Have some more....

682
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:37,813
I chewed up some roots
and packed them right

683
01:16:37,838 --> 01:16:40,234
there, in your wound...
It kills the poison.

684
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:43,890
Big 'Injun medicine, you know...
Wouldn't think your

685
01:16:43,915 --> 01:16:47,552
everyday savage would have
time for medicine, would you?

686
01:16:48,832 --> 01:16:56,832
No, I guess not... Anyway, you're
lookin' um... pretty good now, Honus.

687
01:16:57,933 --> 01:16:59,599
How about you?

688
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:02,428
Me?

689
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:09,620
Oh, ah...
Here, have some more of this.

690
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:17,090
Hah, you haven't told me what it is...
Hocheeka....

691
01:17:19,195 --> 01:17:20,195
It's snake...

692
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,309
Snake?

693
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,117
You've got to cook it just right...

694
01:17:30,948 --> 01:17:33,318
I bet you do...
(sighs)

695
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:36,765
(sighs again)

696
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:46,944
So...

697
01:17:49,246 --> 01:17:54,592
You look....
better than I've ever seen you before...

698
01:17:55,056 --> 01:18:02,230
you look all...
shiny and... and beautiful...

699
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:05,845
like an angel...

700
01:18:11,197 --> 01:18:12,282
Cresta...

701
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:32,466
What the hell you doing?

702
01:18:44,883 --> 01:18:46,938
God, what was in that snake...

703
01:18:48,038 --> 01:18:49,143
No...

704
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,592
It's not the snake...

705
01:19:01,252 --> 01:19:03,989
- You've got your fever back...
- No...

706
01:19:09,181 --> 01:19:13,593
Hey! Look at me...
I'm a traitor, remember?

707
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:15,427
Uh huh... I know...

708
01:19:17,148 --> 01:19:20,059
And for God's sake,
look at the way I swear all the time....

709
01:19:20,348 --> 01:19:21,494
That's true...

710
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:27,210
Well...

711
01:19:28,788 --> 01:19:32,879
- Well, how the hell... how can you tell...
- I'd rather not tell you anything...

712
01:19:33,356 --> 01:19:34,356
Huh?

713
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:40,358
I'd rather hold you, Cresta Maribel Lee...

714
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:44,102
Damn...

715
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,067
Cresta...

716
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:59,525
Don't!
Please... to God, don't...

717
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:03,592
Not unless you mean it...

718
01:20:13,692 --> 01:20:17,688
(sighs)
the whole shaboodle...

719
01:20:42,692 --> 01:20:50,692
(humming)

720
01:20:51,428 --> 01:20:59,428
(singing)

721
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:23,571
(humming with music)

722
01:21:34,018 --> 01:21:35,673
Cresta!

723
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:41,338
Cresta!

724
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:45,459
Cresta!

725
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:12,840
(chuckles)
Come on! Honus!

726
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:17,495
I'm trying to be serious...
I am serious...

727
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:22,358
Naa... I've been thinking...
I should just go on...

728
01:22:22,519 --> 01:22:25,869
What, alone?
I can travel a lot faster alone...

729
01:22:25,929 --> 01:22:28,795
and then I'd come
back here for you...

730
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:32,641
with real food, and a horse, and...
clean socks...

731
01:22:33,977 --> 01:22:36,665
We... are going back... together...

732
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:42,232
You and me... we're here Honus...
don't you see?

733
01:22:42,313 --> 01:22:45,635
The two of us, right here...
That's all...

734
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:50,736
We can't be any place else...

735
01:22:52,205 --> 01:22:55,680
When we go back,
it's not 'we' anymore...

736
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:05,800
(singing with music)

737
01:24:23,961 --> 01:24:27,549
Excuse me... Sir,
I'm sorry to break in on you like this...

738
01:24:27,618 --> 01:24:28,992
My name's Cresta Maribel Lee...

739
01:24:29,096 --> 01:24:30,468
Cresta!

740
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,213
Johnny?

741
01:24:36,428 --> 01:24:37,428
Cresta!

742
01:24:40,766 --> 01:24:42,137
I could'ave swore...

743
01:24:43,277 --> 01:24:47,266
Cresta, I can't...
I just can't believe it...

744
01:24:53,242 --> 01:24:56,110
My God! I'm only asking
for two lousy troopers...

745
01:24:56,482 --> 01:24:58,258
How hard is that then?

746
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:01,775
It's out of the question, Miss Lee...
I'm sorry, it can't be done.

747
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:05,756
- He'll last two weeks if he's lucky...
- Yes, well perhaps by that time...

748
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:07,743
I may be able to send some help.

749
01:25:07,891 --> 01:25:09,789
Well, that's mighty big of you buster....

750
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:11,101
Cresta!
Give me a horse and supplies...

751
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:12,504
I'll go myself...

752
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
Miss Lee, this is wild country...

753
01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:17,960
I'm sorry; I can't allow you
to go out there by yourself.

754
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:20,440
Well, how the hell do you think I got here?

755
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:21,441
Cresta!

756
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:23,027
(sighs)

757
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:26,592
Excuse me sir, but do you think I could
have a few moments alone with Miss Lee?

758
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,554
I think you should, McNair...
I suggest a long and sober talk...

759
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:34,342
Yes... well, thank you Sir.
If you'll excuse me...

760
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:35,616
Indeed!

761
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:40,685
You know, Mitchel...
Yes Sir?

762
01:25:41,112 --> 01:25:46,417
When I see young people, today,
behaving like that, I just...

763
01:25:46,534 --> 01:25:50,003
I can't help wondering what
this God-damned country is coming to?

764
01:25:51,803 --> 01:25:53,771
When we get home we're
going to be married,

765
01:25:53,796 --> 01:25:56,032
aren't we? What's so
terrible about wanting to...

766
01:25:56,435 --> 01:25:59,408
get together with my bro...
Well, nothing, but, I mean, don't we...

767
01:25:59,498 --> 01:26:02,906
even get to say hello first?
Oh, for Christ's sake!

768
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:06,369
You got no reason to swear...
- Swear?

769
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:09,791
Me swear?
You can send someone after Honus....

770
01:26:09,839 --> 01:26:12,577
- We can't... Not for a while.
- Why not?

771
01:26:13,762 --> 01:26:18,553
Cheyenne... and you, more than anyone...
ought to appreciate that.

772
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,157
You'll never find 'em...
Oh, we already have...

773
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:23,231
- We know exactly where they are.
- Where?

774
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:28,140
Oh just... just a little West of here... up
by the twin rock pass, the Jewels Pass...

775
01:26:28,612 --> 01:26:30,948
- Are you sure of that?
- Of course.

776
01:26:31,498 --> 01:26:34,132
We should be inside of their campground
by tomorrow...

777
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,761
(sighs)

778
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:41,689
You know... there's only
one thing wrong with me Johnny...

779
01:26:41,799 --> 01:26:45,881
(sighs)... It's been so long...
so very long...

780
01:26:46,463 --> 01:26:49,844
Oh yea!
- But now we're together...

781
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:51,591
Yes!

782
01:26:51,692 --> 01:26:55,286
Well, it's... just that...
I haven't had anything

783
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:58,616
to eat in two days,
and I'm just so hungry...

784
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:02,467
- I don't know what I'm saying...
- Hungry?

785
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:09,904
If we could just have... a little something...
out on the tall grass, there. (chuckles)

786
01:27:10,178 --> 01:27:16,665
(both laugh) Oh yea... of course...
I'll... I'll be right back.

787
01:27:26,082 --> 01:27:30,088
(indistinct orders)

788
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:32,168
Excuse me Miss?
What are you doing?

789
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:33,463
Ah... Shit!

790
01:27:33,599 --> 01:27:34,599
(gasps)

791
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:40,176
It's all right...
He's my fiancée...

792
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:46,595
By...

793
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:55,141
(gasps)

794
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,730
(gasps)

795
01:28:00,117 --> 01:28:01,974
(sighs)

796
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,360
Uh!

797
01:28:14,893 --> 01:28:15,893
Whoa boy...

798
01:28:16,929 --> 01:28:17,929
(gasps)

799
01:28:18,262 --> 01:28:18,610
(gasps)

800
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,168
Whoa boy...

801
01:28:20,398 --> 01:28:21,398
Whoa...

802
01:28:49,267 --> 01:28:57,267
(sounds of Indian camp)

803
01:28:59,345 --> 01:29:05,303
(indistinct greetings in Cheyenne)

804
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:13,190
(happy greetings in Cheyenne)

805
01:29:13,313 --> 01:29:21,313
(orders in Cheyenne)

806
01:29:32,464 --> 01:29:36,371
- Cresta...
- Wantehemo...

807
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:43,042
Right, men...
put into your minds the dark

808
01:29:43,067 --> 01:29:47,244
abominations...
of these Godless barbarians...

809
01:29:48,636 --> 01:29:49,763
Murder...

810
01:29:50,526 --> 01:29:51,718
Rape...

811
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,363
Torture...

812
01:29:55,164 --> 01:30:00,740
And when you think of your comerades...
fallen, butchered comerades...

813
01:30:01,385 --> 01:30:06,786
ask yourself...
Are we going to give them the same mercy?

814
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,506
You just be we are...

815
01:30:14,177 --> 01:30:15,707
Major Phillips...
Take over.

816
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,081
Advance!

817
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:22,262
McNair?
Move out!

818
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,085
(indistinct orders)

819
01:30:27,086 --> 01:30:28,637
Any word about your... uh...

820
01:30:29,777 --> 01:30:31,860
Financée?
No sir.

821
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:33,843
I'm afraid she's...

822
01:30:34,143 --> 01:30:37,429
well, I think she's hopelessly
infatuated with Private Gent...

823
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:42,493
Ah, that's too bad...
I'm going to ride in the wagon...

824
01:30:42,635 --> 01:30:44,635
my back is killing me again...

825
01:30:47,116 --> 01:30:51,517
(singing) Yes, we'll rally round the
flag boys, we'll rally once again...

826
01:30:52,104 --> 01:30:55,644
(singing) Shouting the
battle cry of freedom...

827
01:30:55,833 --> 01:31:00,538
(singing) We will rally from the hills, and
we'll gather from the plains...

828
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:05,093
(singing) Shouting the
battle cry of freedom.

829
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:13,169
(singing) The Union forever, hurrah boys, hurrah,
Down with the traitor, up with the scythe,

830
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:19,435
(singing) Yes, we'll rally round the flag,
we'll rally once again,

831
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:26,432
(singing) Shouting the battle cry of
freedom. We will rally from the hills...

832
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:33,058
(singing) and we'll gather from the plains,
shouting the battle cry of freedom.

833
01:31:34,929 --> 01:31:37,900
- Well?
- It could be the two rear flankers, Sir...

834
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,808
- Except that there's three of them.
- Let me have those...

835
01:31:54,404 --> 01:31:56,404
We found this man riding
through Lever's Pass, Sir.

836
01:31:57,443 --> 01:31:59,156
It's not a cavalry mount...

837
01:31:59,927 --> 01:32:02,782
No Sir.
If I may, Sir...

838
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:06,266
I'm attached to the
Colorado 11th Volunteers...

839
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:09,043
We're the Colorado
11th Volunteers...

840
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:14,108
Yes Sir!
I'm Private Honus Gent, reporting...

841
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:16,043
You?

842
01:32:20,643 --> 01:32:28,643
(speaking Cheyenne)

843
01:32:21,126 --> 01:32:26,143
Cannons...
Many soldiers and guns...

844
01:32:27,499 --> 01:32:30,699
You must leave...

845
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,856
We want no war...

846
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,636
Your people gave me...

847
01:32:41,905 --> 01:32:43,101
a flag...

848
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:45,192
and a medal of friendship...

849
01:32:46,056 --> 01:32:48,192
I do not trust them...

850
01:32:50,186 --> 01:32:52,420
they will kill our people...

851
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:58,843
we will fight...

852
01:32:58,853 --> 01:33:00,267
I say peace...

853
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:18,588
you do not wear your necklace...
my gift of love...

854
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:27,977
you gave it to someone...

855
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:31,932
Yes...
and I must go to him.

856
01:33:46,604 --> 01:33:52,504
My heart torn by all this...
(Cheyenne) Behavo...

857
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:55,682
If you'd let me talk to her
for just a few minutes she

858
01:33:55,707 --> 01:33:58,223
might convince Spotted Wolf
to give up without a fight...

859
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,501
Without a fight?

860
01:33:59,891 --> 01:34:03,230
We destroyed the rifles they were
counting on, so they can't possibly win.

861
01:34:03,909 --> 01:34:06,077
- There's just no sense to it...
- Private Gent!

862
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:10,840
I don't know what sort of relationship
you and this woman have had....

863
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,592
but I can assure you that
my men are prepared to move...

864
01:34:13,613 --> 01:34:15,276
against the enemy at daybreak.

865
01:34:15,599 --> 01:34:17,844
- And move they will...
- Sir!

866
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,733
Twenty-one of your own comerades
murdered... cut to pieces...

867
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:22,768
- I know, Sir...
- The price will be paid, soldier.

868
01:34:27,034 --> 01:34:29,034
- Is it worth it?
- Dismissed!

869
01:34:31,947 --> 01:34:34,141
Yes Sir.

870
01:34:59,714 --> 01:35:01,715
Prepare to fire...

871
01:35:18,308 --> 01:35:21,213
There just seems to be
normal activity over there, Sir...

872
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,880
The cannon will commence
firing at seven thirty...

873
01:35:24,905 --> 01:35:27,458
six rounds apiece until
we find the range....

874
01:35:29,092 --> 01:35:37,092
(voices speaking Cheyenne)

875
01:35:43,535 --> 01:35:47,037
and I know, McNair...
I know she's in there someplace...

876
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:50,275
no matter what we might think of her
she's still a white woman...

877
01:35:50,299 --> 01:35:51,862
that can't be helped.

878
01:35:52,661 --> 01:35:53,661
No, Sir...

879
01:35:54,975 --> 01:35:56,108
Can I depend on you?

880
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:58,955
I will do my duty Sir....

881
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:02,061
Good...
Good...

882
01:36:09,334 --> 01:36:11,197
All right, Lieutenant...
Give the order...

883
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:15,171
- They're coming out Sir!
- What? What's that?

884
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:18,803
- I think it's Spotted Wolf!
- My God Sir, he's got a flag of truce...

885
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:21,506
- Yes Sir, it's a white flag...
- Nonsense!

886
01:36:21,831 --> 01:36:24,631
- Will you see for yourself...
- I told you Lieutenant... Give the order!

887
01:36:24,854 --> 01:36:25,237
Sir?

888
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:26,511
Well, give the order!

889
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:28,950
Yes Sir.

890
01:36:29,911 --> 01:36:31,457
Open Fire!

891
01:36:32,231 --> 01:36:33,231
Ready...

892
01:36:34,681 --> 01:36:36,932
Cover ears...
Fire!

893
01:36:47,474 --> 01:36:49,731
(calls out in Cheyenne)

894
01:36:50,033 --> 01:36:54,004
All pieces, increase elevation
one degree...

895
01:36:54,514 --> 01:36:56,514
Fire when ready...

896
01:36:58,486 --> 01:37:04,387
(screaming in Cheyenne)

897
01:37:04,943 --> 01:37:12,943
(indistinct commands
and screams in Cheyenne)

898
01:37:29,684 --> 01:37:30,769
They've the range now...

899
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:32,334
Stop!

900
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:32,983
Stop!

901
01:37:33,418 --> 01:37:34,111
Gent!

902
01:37:34,303 --> 01:37:35,643
Stay away from that cannon!

903
01:37:36,342 --> 01:37:37,342
No!

904
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:38,621
Arrest him!

905
01:37:39,297 --> 01:37:39,826
Stop!

906
01:37:40,093 --> 01:37:41,093
Arrest that man!

907
01:37:43,287 --> 01:37:45,753
No!
No... There's a white woman in that...

908
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:49,276
Colonel look....
They're attacking...

909
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:56,391
Bugeler, sound Alert....

910
01:38:11,259 --> 01:38:14,259
(indistinct yells)

911
01:38:18,269 --> 01:38:20,269
(indistinct yells)

912
01:38:23,404 --> 01:38:26,626
Soldiers!
After those bastards!

913
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:37,186
Main troops... form covering party...
brace for incoming...

914
01:38:37,285 --> 01:38:39,446
company ride, Forward!

915
01:38:39,822 --> 01:38:41,570
(commands in Cheyenne)

916
01:38:45,049 --> 01:38:47,143
Form three ranks...

917
01:38:49,702 --> 01:38:51,046
Charge!

918
01:38:55,791 --> 01:39:03,791
(sounds of the melee)

919
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,830
line up the front...

920
01:39:19,431 --> 01:39:27,431
(sounds of the melee)

921
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:28,581
(words in Cheyenne)

922
01:40:28,663 --> 01:40:33,700
(explosions)

923
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:37,898
Troops...
Rally to your Guidons....

924
01:40:49,214 --> 01:40:54,150
McNair, form these troops in
two columns on the left and right...

925
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:57,590
advance at full gallop...
attacking the village on both flanks...

926
01:40:57,856 --> 01:40:59,416
You take the left, I'll take the right.

927
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,975
Artillery pieces, cease firing.

928
01:41:07,147 --> 01:41:10,400
We'll attack...
right of the village...

929
01:41:12,321 --> 01:41:17,521
Troops, at the front...
March!

930
01:41:23,707 --> 01:41:28,942
Troops, by the front, March...

931
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:15,381
Halt!

932
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:41,142
(challenges in Cheyenne)

933
01:42:59,903 --> 01:43:01,629
Charge!

934
01:43:47,996 --> 01:43:49,612
Are you OK, Colonel?

935
01:43:49,876 --> 01:43:50,876
I'm all right,

936
01:43:52,163 --> 01:43:55,944
McNair... Raze the village!

937
01:43:56,806 --> 01:43:59,872
Burn this...
pestilence!

938
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,200
(shouts in Cheyenne)

939
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:53,091
(shouts in Cheyenne)

940
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:18,968
Keewa!

941
01:45:15,885 --> 01:45:17,155
Keewa!

942
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:22,430
Keewa!

943
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:24,766
Keewa!

944
01:45:26,341 --> 01:45:27,592
Keewa!

945
01:45:40,177 --> 01:45:41,177
Cresta!

946
01:45:46,387 --> 01:45:47,425
Cresta!

947
01:45:53,147 --> 01:45:54,355
Cresta!

948
01:46:05,946 --> 01:46:07,355
Hold his legs...

949
01:46:36,087 --> 01:46:38,256
Please, please... please

950
01:46:46,996 --> 01:46:48,055
Please...

951
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:50,738
please...
please...

952
01:47:12,212 --> 01:47:15,302
Yah hoo!

953
01:47:24,045 --> 01:47:25,835
Get that white woman out of there...

954
01:48:15,003 --> 01:48:16,938
I'll put one poor devil
out of its misery....

955
01:48:20,394 --> 01:48:22,248
Damn you!

956
01:48:22,269 --> 01:48:23,439
What are you doing?

957
01:48:26,966 --> 01:48:29,941
Why? Why? Why?
- Shut up, Honus!

958
01:48:39,859 --> 01:48:40,859
He's gone mad...

959
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:53,271
Cresta...

960
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:06,641
Got a prayer, Soldier Blue?

961
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:07,708
A nice poem?

962
01:50:11,578 --> 01:50:13,400
Say something pretty...

963
01:50:17,999 --> 01:50:23,403
(grunting, groaning and choking)

964
01:50:23,445 --> 01:50:25,001
And to each of you...

965
01:50:26,066 --> 01:50:28,234
To officer and soldier alike,

966
01:50:29,925 --> 01:50:33,800
I offer my most profound... admiration,

967
01:50:34,767 --> 01:50:36,500
my deepest affection,

968
01:50:36,962 --> 01:50:40,187
and my overwhelming gratitude...
for a job well done.

969
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:44,500
You men here today...

970
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:49,045
have succeeded... at
making another part of America...

971
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:51,577
a decent place...
for people to live.

972
01:50:52,707 --> 01:50:54,900
We have given the Injun...

973
01:50:56,326 --> 01:50:58,535
a lesson he will not soon forget.

974
01:51:00,603 --> 01:51:03,400
But more than that...

975
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,900
for the rest of your lives...

976
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,100
You men will hold your heads proud...

977
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,580
when this day is mentioned...

978
01:51:11,217 --> 01:51:12,566
and you will say...

979
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:15,500
Yes! I was with Iverson!

980
01:51:32,784 --> 01:51:37,100
The Eleventh Colorado Volunteers...
Move out!

981
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:12,233
Cresta...

982
01:53:36,263 --> 01:53:39,446
On November 29th, 1864,

983
01:53:39,616 --> 01:53:44,200
a unit of Colorado cavalry,
numbering over 700 men,

984
01:53:44,577 --> 01:53:48,226
attacked a peaceful Cheyenne village
at Sand Creek, Colorado.

985
01:53:49,252 --> 01:53:53,532
The Indians raised the American Flag
and a white flag of surrender.

986
01:53:54,267 --> 01:53:59,458
Nevertheless the cavalry attacked...
massacring 500 Indians,

987
01:53:59,854 --> 01:54:02,411
more than half of whom
were women and children.

988
01:54:03,282 --> 01:54:05,466
Over one hundred scalps were taken...

989
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:07,277
bodies dismembered...

990
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:09,889
plus numerous reports of rape.

991
01:54:10,990 --> 01:54:13,002
General Nelson A. Miles,

992
01:54:13,374 --> 01:54:14,691
Army Chief of Staff...

993
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:16,584
termed the massacre...

994
01:54:17,018 --> 01:54:19,958
perhaps the foulest and
most unjust crime...

995
01:54:20,534 --> 01:54:22,273
in the annals of America.

996
01:54:25,273 --> 01:54:26,373
