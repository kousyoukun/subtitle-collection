Honus.
Hey, Honus!

28
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,740
Did you see'em?

29
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,676
Did you see the shape of them boobs?

30
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:48,797
Well?  Well, where is she?
Where's the woman?

31
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,060
Ah... What the devil?

32
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,735
Who put here in there?

33
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:58,376
She's yours, Captain... you've got her.

34
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:02,531
Bitch!

35
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:27,776
Detail.
Forward, ho!

36
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,800
Look at her, settin' in there.

37
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,394
Two years captive with them red bucks.
Don't it make you wonder though?

38
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:24,639
What?

39
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,098
How many of 'em got to her.
Don't it get you all worked up?

40
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:32,484
- Wade. Sometimes you talk like a pervert.
- Me?

41
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,689
It's not her fault the Cheyenne grabbed her.

42
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:38,311
Well, I'm not sayin' it is, but... by guff.

43
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,568
I'd sure like to get my hands on some of that.

44
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:43,083
You can keep your hands to yourself
when we get to Fort Reunion.

45
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,090
- Why?
- He's waiting for her there.

46
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:46,942
- Who?
- Her financée.

47
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,201
Spingarn!

48
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,466
Spingarn!

49
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,633
We need flankers.

50
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,038
Sir?

51
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,212
You ought to put out some flankers.

52
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:11,810
Are you advising me, Captain?
Me?

53
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:14,137
Huh?
I'm only the Pay Master.

54
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:19,089
You get no 'advice' from me soldier.
I'm telling you... put out some flankers.

55
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,358
What're you afraid of, sir?
Road agents?

56
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:23,749
Cheyenne!

57
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:29,312
Excuse me Cap'n, but I ain't heard yet about
no Injuns comin' after a Pay Master's detail.

58
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,554
- They got no use for that money chest.
- Flankers!

59
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:35,976
Yes, sir.

60
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:40,719
Get.

61
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:47,309
All right. I guess we're out far enough.

62
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:49,865
Why pick on us?

63
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:51,669
Why not?

64
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:57,082
Just getting up real close...
you can almost see her...

65
00:08:57,267 --> 00:09:00,419
you could take your hand...
and you could put it right around...

66
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,580
one of her pretty little ankles.

67
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,562
You could Honus... an' you're a snot nose.

68
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,014
You're a good friend...
the best friend I ever had...

69
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,883
but you're snot nosed and you always will be.

70
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,404
Willie!

71
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:33,129
Take cover!
Take cover!

72
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,164
Spingarn... you stupid son of a bitch.

73
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,023
Dismount!
Take cover and fire at will.

74
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:13,148
Oh, my God.

75
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:20,500
Lieutenant... the woman... the woman!

76
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:23,256
Get up.

77
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:30,035
Stupid... cocking... murdering bastards.

78
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,681
Imbecile... the murderer.

79
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,675
Fire you... now I advise you
to try to control yourself.

80
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:40,680
Oh my God... we're lost.

81
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,497
We can treat with them.

82
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,993
- What?
- White flag!

83
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:45,930
Talk to them... we can make'em listen!

84
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:48,492
Captain, those bloody butchers
want nothing more than our hides.

85
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:51,850
I'm gonna talk to them.
I'm gonna talk to them.

86
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,348
- Captain... Come back here!
- You, Indians. No Kill!

87
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,142
No kill!

88
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,271
Fire! Fire!
Woods are on fire.

89
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:24,908
Fire!

90
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,879
Won't take'em long now.

91
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,432
Hey!
Hey, up here.

92
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:48,400
Come on!

93
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,359
Come on!

94
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,926
Well, don't just stand there.
Get your ass up here!

95
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,505
Gee. You it!

96
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,172
What?

97
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,382
- You all that's coming?
- I don't know.

98
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,562
Well, follow me!

99
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,040
Wait!

100
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,623
Hey!  Get down... come on.

101
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,181
Well, there goes the wagon.

102
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,257
They'll be looking for us.

103
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:56,690
Nah.

104
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,896
Not for long. Not him!

105
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:00,982
Not who?

106
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,127
Spotted Wolf!

107
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,023
In case you didn't know what hit you,
they're Cheyenne.

108
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:11,584
How can you tell it's Spotted Wolf?

109
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,233
I saw him.

110
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:14,740
You know him by sight?

111
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,225
I know him.

112
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,492
What's your name?

113
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:23,794
Honus Gent.

114
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,556
Cresta Maribel Lee.

115
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,477
- Are you wounded there?
- What? - Are you wounded?

116
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:32,661
- Oh? No... that's not my blood.

117
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:40,921
Good 'cause we've got a long wait. They are gonna
be messin' with those bodies down there for hours.

118
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:47,419
- Ah... what do you doing?
- I'm takin' off my pants.

119
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:52,797
- Why?
- 'Cause it's hotter than hell an'they're ichin'.

120
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:54,853
Oh.

121
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:02,995
Ahh. We'd better take it easy.
Get comfortable.

122
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,826
I sure as hell wish I hadn't lost my hat.

123
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,390
Ah... Miss?

124
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:10,720
Huh?

125
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:15,861
About Spotted Wolf?
How do you?  Ah...

126
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,277
I'm his wife.

127
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:21,368
Oh.

128
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,614
Hey, look here.

129
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,892
Come on.

130
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,041
Hey, what're you doing there?

131
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:25,954
Nothing.

132
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:30,197
Look, I don't want to rush you soldier,
but it's going to be dark in a couple of hours...

133
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,708
and we can't hang around here.

134
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,591
You're... you're robbing the dead.

135
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,144
My God.
You're robbing the dead!

136
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:06,743
Yep!  Well, I sure as hell ain't getting much.
A little hard tack mostly, but that'll keep us...

137
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,518
going for a while.
You find anything better?

138
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,227
My God.

139
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,509
- It was you.
- Me?

140
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,059
- He was looking for you!
- What the hell are you talking about?

141
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,133
Spotted Wolf.
He was out to bring you back.

142
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,514
- Bull shit!
- The Cheyennes would...

143
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:39,141
- What?
- You heard me. I've nothing to do with it.

144
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,247
The Cheyennes would never attack
a Pay Master's detail.

145
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:43,264
Bull shit!

146
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:49,677
- He was looking for you!
- Ah, he wouldn't trouble himself.

147
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:54,892
Don't flatter me, Soldier Blue.
I'm not worth any chest of gold.

148
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,892
They've got no use for gold.

149
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,592
Well, what the hell do you think
they were fighting with?

150
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:04,717
Rifles cost money, see...
and if you don't believe me...

151
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:09,107
then try and find the pay chest...
go ahead... find it!

152
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,907
Any more questions?

153
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:48,094
- I want to say something.
- Yeah? Well hang on to it, we're leaving.

154
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:49,592
For them!

155
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:50,871
Huh?

156
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:54,976
Something must be said for them.

157
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:01,850
You mean a kind of service, huh?
Ah, what the hell... go ahead.

158
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,029
- Should be a prayer.
- Right! A prayer.

159
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,924
I bet you know a hundred prayers.

160
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,534
I should be here.

161
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:14,964
Huh?

162
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,125
I should be here, lying with them, with my company.

163
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:25,004
Why? I mean, you've come out pretty good
it seems to me. See.

164
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:28,044
They're all lying here dead,
and you're still walking.

165
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:35,044
- Murdering savages.
- Yeah, you go right ahead.

166
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:40,706
You can howl at the moon if you want to,
but it's not going to get us back to Fort Reunion.

167
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,605
Now, you say your something,
or let's get the hell out of here.

168
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,312
Theirs not to make reply.

169
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,211
Theirs not to reason why.

170
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:24,793
Theirs but to do and die.

171
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,346
Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.

172
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,152
Storm'd at with shot and shell.

173
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:37,803
Boldly they rode and well.

174
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:40,830
Into the jaws of...

175
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,591
of Death.

176
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,784
Into the mouth of Hell.

177
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:49,603
Rode the six hundred.

178
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:54,701
Flash'd all their sabres bare.

179
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,475
Flash'd as they turn'd in air.

180
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:05,979
Charging an army, while all the world wonder'd:

181
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,900
Theirs not to reason why.

182
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,641
Theirs but to do and die:

183
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,410
Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.

184
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,602
Jesus.

186
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,205
Throw them out.

187
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:10,775
What?

188
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:16,592
Your socks. Why you bother?

189
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:44,055
Here.

191
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:50,906
What's the matter?

192
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:53,884
- It's mud!
- It's a little dirty.

193
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:56,850
- Where's the canteen?
- Oh, no.

194
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:01,167
You're not gonna' touch something that was robbed 
from the dead, are you?

195
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,926
All right.

196
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:09,171
- We might be needing them later.
- That's using your head Soldier Blue.

197
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,696
Would you like some more mud?

198
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:22,989
Isn't it.
Can't you do something with that dress?

199
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:27,285
- Huh?
- Can't you... pull it together some way?

200
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:31,330
Couple of days, I'll lose a few pounds.
I won't be showin' through so much.

201
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:35,565
- Uh... it never did fit me anyway... one of hers.
- Whose?

202
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:41,592
That woman at the Snake Flats agency.
Right off, she stripped me down naked.

203
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:44,136
Stuck me in a tub, and gave me this here dress.

204
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:49,313
Hey! Hey, did you see the hat?

205
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:53,642
Big bright yellow hat she gave me.
Covered my whole face.

206
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:58,660
I did love that hat, though.
I'm sick at heart about losin' that.

207
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:01,874
- Sick at heart.
- You can say that now!

208
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,431
What's the matter?
What'd I say?

209
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:08,908
21 men lying dead back there and you
sit here mourning a yellow hat.

210
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:12,387
- 21 men!
- A drop in the old bucket.

211
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:15,401
- A what?
- It's not the army, Soldier Blue.

212
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,582
They're not the ones getting killed off...

213
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,734
in this damn fool country.
- Our country, Miss Lee, is neither damned or foolish.

214
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:24,303
Balls!

215
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:30,766
- Mrs. Lee, you have a most profane way of speaking.
- You should hear me in Cheyenne.  Do you want to?

216
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:32,700
No!

217
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:37,391
Good brave lads comin' out here
to kill themselves a real live Injun.

218
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,817
Puttin'up their forts in a country 
they've got no claim to.

219
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:44,813
So what the hell do you expect the Indians to do?
Sit back on their butts...

220
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:49,480
while the army take's over their land
- You saw for yourself what they did, taking off scalps.

221
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:52,891
Yeah, and who taught them that little trick?
The white man!

222
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,647
And cutting off hands and cutting off feet 
and cutting off...

223
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:03,088
I know what they cut off, but at least
they don't make tobacco pouches out of them... uhah.

224
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,178
- That's something else you soldier boy's made up. 
- You're lying.

225
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:12,192
You ever seen an Indian camp
after the army's been there? Huh?

226
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:16,982
You ever see the women and what was
done to them before they where killed?

227
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:22,977
Ever see the little boys and girls 
stuck on the long knifes?

228
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,342
Huh? Stuck and dying?

229
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:30,749
WelI, I have.

230
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:32,606
Fine.

231
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:39,832
Go to sleep.

232
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,210
You're lying.

233
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:18,693
♪ My true love sleeps o'er the hillside.
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey. ♪

234
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:27,020
♪ My true love sleeps o'er the hillside.
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey. ♪

235
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:39,846
♪ Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey.
A few more jumps and I'll be with him. Hey, ho. ♪

236
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:52,271
I'll tell you about that hat.
That hat was just like the one my Daddy gave me.

237
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:59,707
On a Sunday morning a long time ago,
he knelt down and he kissed me. 

238
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:06,161
Then he put that hat on my head.
That's the last I ever saw of him. 

239
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:10,727
- You mean he died?
- Hell no, he ran off and left me.

240
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,259
Put me in an orphanage on Canal Street.

241
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:19,292
Eh... what the hell.
Whoever asked to get themselves born anyway... huh?  Who?

242
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,450
- I'm going a sleep.
- You do that soldier.

243
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:27,039
And you try to keep your mind off me.

244
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:31,140
- Miss Lee, I certainly have at no.
- Oh, I know.

245
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:34,086
If you get too all-fired horny during the night.

246
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:38,217
Just, ah... go soak your head in the stream over there.

247
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:58,068
♪ My true love sleeps o'er the hillside.
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey. ♪

248
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:07,871
♪ My true love sleeps o'er the hillside.
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey. ♪

249
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:32,615
Well.

250
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,873
That's it. Over there.

251
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,806
- What?
- The old Garvey wagon road.

252
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,987
- Oh, what about it?
- We'll be sticking close to it.

253
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,084
- Why?
- Well it's a straight shoot right into Fort Reunion.

254
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,026
Maybe, uh... four days at the most.

255
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:14,980
There we are, right out there in the open.

256
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:18,385
And there they come.
A-whooping it, out of nowhere.

257
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:23,017
They'll have us hanging feet high,
and let the crows pluck out our eyes.

258
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:27,215
You may not be aware, Miss Cresta Lee...

259
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:33,409
but I'm a professional soldier, and I happen to be
well experienced in this part of the country

260
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:37,058
How long have they kept you private, Private.

261
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,592
No one's kept me, Miss Lee.
It was my father's wish.

262
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:46,841
You take that road, Soldier Blue, 
and you'll get your father coming out here to bury you.

263
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:50,747
My father's dead.

264
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:55,553
He was killed at Little Big Horn, last year.
Murdered by the Sioux.

265
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:01,262
I wonder if that General Custer
took your father's advice.

266
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,069
Well, it's a sure thing I ain't takin' yours.

267
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:10,810
Listen, you keep the rifle.

268
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:15,153
The jerky you can have,
just give me some of this hard tack.

269
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,964
There, there we are.

270
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:22,129
Good luck, Soldier Blue,
I'll tell them at the Fort it wasn't my fault.

271
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,982
Hey, Private Gent!

272
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:01,248
Miss Lee!

273
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:25,861
- Well. Get lost?
- Couldn't do it!

274
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,557
- Huh?
- Leaving you all alone.

275
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,837
I couldn't forgive myself
if something happened to you.

276
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:37,260
Well... thank you!

277
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:38,014
Heh!

278
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:41,485
What could I say to your financée.

279
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,949
Oh! You know about him, huh?

280
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,968
How could I face him?
How could I look him in the eye?

281
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,468
Yeh, I see.
A soldier's duty for another soldier, and to hell with me.

282
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,687
A matter of principle, Miss Lee.

283
00:34:57,692 --> 00:35:02,023
It's a matter of crap.
Have some berries.

284
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:04,592
Berries make me sick.

285
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:08,049
- Well, Christ.
- Naah!

286
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:25,216
Look at that, another rip.

287
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:26,992
God dammit.

288
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,923
- Do you talk in front of him that way?
- Who?

289
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:32,292
Your fiancée?

290
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:33,678
Huh!

291
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:36,493
That's a funny thing, you know.
We don't talk.

292
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:39,463
I can't remember one conversation we ever had.

293
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:44,014
He'd just grab hold... and I'd hold off, and...

294
00:35:44,531 --> 00:35:46,353
Thank goodness I held off long enough.

295
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,063
So he, uh, joined the army.
Boy, that did it...

296
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,968
Six long months at Fort Reunion, and no women.

297
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:00,886
I was sent for, to come out and have a military wedding.

298
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,823
Here I am, still trying to get there.

299
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,205
- You sure he's still waiting?
- He said so in the telegraph.

300
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,946
The way you put it, well.

301
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:15,956
Uh...  A person gets the idea
you're marrying him for money.

302
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:17,948
Yeah, I am!

303
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:44,530
Lose something?

304
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,717
My sock.

305
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:51,680
- It's gone!
- I'll tell you soldier...

306
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,655
it's gonna cut your washing in half.

307
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:58,270
- I'm going back a way.
- You're not! - It won't take but a moment.

308
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:03,592
Look, I promise I won't report you
for being out of uniform.

309
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:09,555
Jesus Christ.

310
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:20,513
A hundred miles ahead of us,
and you're going back... back!

311
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:27,082
What the hell am I doing.
Twenty-one soldiers, and I get you!

312
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:23,606
Don't touch it.
Don't you lay a finger on that rifle! You hear me?

313
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:26,358
It's hidden there under the jacket.
You just let it stay like that.

314
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,544
- Cheyenne?
- Kiowa!

315
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:33,468
- Oh!
- And they want to kill us, but not too quick.

316
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,591
- Where'd they come from.
- From one lousy sock.

317
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:40,924
- Well, we've got to do something.
- You can watch.

318
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:43,456
What're you talking about?

319
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:47,551
They're going to rape me Soldier Blue.
and then they're gonna kill us afterwards.

320
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,087
Oh, my God!

321
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:15,670
- Did I see you?
- I spit.

322
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,276
- Well, how could you?
- Ssshhh.

323
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,281
- What;s going on?
- I insulted them.

324
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,690
Oh, no!

325
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:27,926
I told them they were five old women.

326
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:29,592
I said that they were afraid of you.

327
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:32,592
That you were tall and strong and feared nothing.

328
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,826
You.

329
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:42,373
Wait... don't pick it up... take off your clothes.

330
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:47,058
Not me! Look at him, Soldier Blue.
He can move twice as fast as you can...

331
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,483
in those stupid army pants.
Take'em off!

332
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,634
I can't fight in my long johns.

333
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:53,425
Take them of, too!

334
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,890
He can hold you with them.

335
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:00,530
Look, it's my life as well as yours.
You want to kill us both? Take them off!

336
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,563
- I can't!
- Take'em off!

337
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:04,731
- No!
- You bastard!

338
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:07,707
Shut up!

339
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,012
Kill him!

340
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:41,640
You've won. They expect you to kill him.

341
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:31,617
Hey Honus!
You did it!

342
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:33,900
You did it!

343
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,222
Honus!

344
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:58,609
Hey, Honus. Wait for me!

345
00:43:03,906 --> 00:43:04,830
Honus!

346
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,787
- Honus.
- Wait up!

347
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,802
Wha... what're you doing?

348
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:48,517
I'm freezing my ass off.

349
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:53,341
You... you can't sleep here.

350
00:43:53,835 --> 00:43:55,093
Why not?

351
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:59,003
Well. I'm here.

352
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:03,911
Turn over and close your eyes,
we'll be warm in no time.

353
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,962
Honus what're you doing?

354
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:11,588
I can't!

355
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,831
You can't what?

356
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:17,568
I can't do it.

357
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,516
What do you want to do, Honus?

358
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:30,905
Oh man.
Take it! You take it.

359
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,313
I want the rifle Honus.

360
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:30,188
What for?

361
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:32,452
It's a goat..

362
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:33,423
What?

363
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:36,718
Honest to God, it is a real live goat.

364
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,865
Now don't argue with me...
give me the rifle

365
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,775
I want to see for myself.

366
00:46:41,893 --> 00:46:43,773
Oh, no... Honus!

367
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:55,885
- Give me that rifle.
- Sshh, you'll scare him.

368
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,919
He can hear is and you're
gonna miss him by three hills.

369
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:00,576
- I'll get him.
- You'll miss him.

370
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,082
I'll get him.

371
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:25,518
He's gone.

372
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:33,677
Look, you dumb gun soldier.
He's gone.

373
00:47:33,822 --> 00:47:37,857
You stupid, beardless, tenderfoot!

374
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:45,738
I hope you choke on berries.
Do you hear me? I hope you throw up all night.

375
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:50,200
Miss Lee.

376
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,627
Cresta.

377
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:24,120
- Brain shot. Dead on.
- Oh, oh Honus.

378
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:26,152
It's beautiful.

379
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,282
Oh, Honus.

381
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:59,833
I've got to tell you the truth, Honus.
He was a tough old bastard.

382
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:05,232
- Please, I've asked you not to.
- All right, all right, I'm sorry.

383
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:09,295
- It's not that I'm a prude or anything.
- Oh, I know you're not, Honus.

384
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:10,574
I've really gotta be more careful.

386
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,463
Well, I guess it's time we turned in.

387
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:25,758
Honus.

388
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,298
It's stupid.

389
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:34,375
You over there, and me over here.

390
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:37,424
Honus?

391
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,058
All right, I guess you're right.

392
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:35,846
Honus.

393
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:37,713
Will you be all right.
I mean.

394
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:39,876
- I know what you mean.
- Will you?

395
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,229
I'll make it. Somehow.

396
00:50:44,615 --> 00:50:46,615
Listen, I'll try not to move much.

397
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:50,256
- That'll help.
- I will.

398
00:50:56,692 --> 00:50:57,530
Smells like rain.

399
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,067
Well, there isn't a cloud in the sky.

400
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:07,843
'Night, Honus.

401
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:10,386
Good night, Miss Lee.

402
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,790
Shut up!

403
00:51:43,178 --> 00:51:44,246
It's a white man's fire.

404
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:46,869
How do you know?

405
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:50,741
It's different from a red man's fire.

406
00:51:51,865 --> 00:51:52,610
Oh.

407
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,632
Gosh Almighty!

408
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:40,265
I hope you'll forgive the intrusion, sir.

409
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:50,243
I'm Private Honus Gent,
of the Calorado 11th Cavalry.

410
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:51,842
Lord, declare.

411
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:53,397
And... uh.

412
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:56,897
This young lady is Miss Cresta Lee, 
from New York City.

413
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,335
- So 'tis, so 'tis.
- We're trying to get to Fort Reunion.

414
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:07,250
You see, uh. My troop was wiped out 
by the Cheyenne.

415
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:10,837
- Devils. Devils.
- It was a Pay Master's escort.

416
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,592
And Miss Lee had joined us
to meet her fiancée.

417
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,234
Good... hah... good for you.

418
00:53:17,129 --> 00:53:17,812
Yeah.

419
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:20,739
Where is your guns?

420
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:23,798
- Guns?
- Guns. You're the hunting type?

421
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:27,851
Oh no.
Uh... we lost our rifle in the flood.

422
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,718
Hey! That was a ripple, wasn't it?

423
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,924
Come near drownin' my two beauties, there.

424
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:34,805
They been 16 years with Isaac Cumber.

425
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:37,244
Huh. Heh.

426
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,486
I'm pleased to meet you Mr. Cumber.

427
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,109
Isaac Q... the Q part was my daddy's joke...

428
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:45,868
being as he calls me Cumber....sayin' Q Cumber...

429
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:51,332
but I kinda like it.

430
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:52,123
Oh.

431
00:53:53,656 --> 00:53:57,403
That's a. quite a wagon.
You... travel in style

432
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,502
Yeh, I do, ah, I surely do.

433
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:03,690
I got grub and tools and blankets and,
ah, bolts of calico.

434
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:07,113
- Just in case.
- In case of Indians, huh?

435
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:08,731
Take a look.

436
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:14,304
Take a look in these eyes, Soldier.
That's honesty you see there.

437
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:16,555
Hard rock honesty!

438
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,681
I treats 'em fair, and I treats 'em square.

439
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,951
And they don't fool none with Isaac Q!

440
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:26,766
- What about hostiles?
- Hostiles! 'Ya think I trade with hostiles?

441
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:30,347
Devils.
Devils.

442
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:34,273
Hey, you look kinda' peek'd, Missy.

443
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:36,253
You don't talk much, huh?

444
00:54:36,296 --> 00:54:38,449
Well, that's alright.
A man would rather look at a woman than...

445
00:54:38,481 --> 00:54:40,349
talk to her, any day, and you... uh.

446
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,336
I can see more of you right now...

447
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,639
than I seen of my wife in 27 years.

448
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:46,227
God rest her soul.

449
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,128
Her frosty-faced soul.

450
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,305
- We could use some food, Mr. Cumber.
- Yea, you could, you surely could.

451
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:57,234
I'm... ah. I'm partial to rabbit, myself.

452
00:54:58,237 --> 00:54:58,950
That'd be fine.

453
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,383
If you don't mind,
I could use some of your calico.

454
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:03,174
Help yourself.
In back of the wagon.

455
00:55:03,902 --> 00:55:05,685
- Are we met?
- What?

456
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:09,692
- I get the feeling we met.
- No, I don't think so.

458
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,499
In my rucksack, help yourself, good lye soap.
you can, uh, scrub each other off, or, uh.

459
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:21,622
Whatever else you have a mind to.

460
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,652
Are you sure you haven't met him before?

461
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:34,697
- I'm sure!
- Think about it.

462
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:35,159
Why?

463
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:38,111
- Because there's something wrong.
- What?

464
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:40,364
I don't know.

465
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:41,957
The man's a Devil, right?

466
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:45,273
- He's a pots trader, right?
- Yeah, is something wrong?

467
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,726
Pots traders don't go out looking for gold.

468
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:51,325
- And especially not in Indian country.
- So he wants to get rich quick.

469
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,319
- Who doesn't?
- Well, uh, I still think.

470
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:58,136
Oh no! Please, don't think!
Not now!

471
00:55:58,263 --> 00:56:00,463
- We have got food and a nice warm fire.
- What if he... uh.

472
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,031
Wait a minute.

473
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:07,567
How do we know you didn't meet
through Spotted Wolf's camp?

474
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,092
- He doesn't trade with hostile Devils.
- That could be it.

475
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:13,775
- What could be it? - Trading with the Cheyenne.
- Bolts of cloth?

476
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:16,058
I mean guns.
Rifles.

477
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:18,521
Well, there's the wagon.
Go... look for'em.

478
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:53,176
Ah... eh!

479
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:01,434
- 'Ya like it? 
- It's different.

480
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:06,890
Boy Honus, you sure know how to flatter a girl.

481
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:09,450
'Must be a born gift.

482
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:12,632
They must be hidden somewhere else!

483
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,028
- You know the type tal.
- Here.

484
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:17,864
- What?
- Take a bath.

485
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:22,915
Listen to me. That old man is trading off rifles 
for the pay cheques we had.

486
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,562
Honus, if I'm gonna look different,
you might as well smell different. Now take the soap.

487
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:28,449
Maybe it's got a false bottom.

488
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,138
- I'm going to take a look.
- No!

489
00:57:31,174 --> 00:57:33,174
Right now, before he get's back.

490
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,895
- No!
- Oh, get out of my way.

491
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,576
Honus, you've got no right.

492
00:57:41,143 --> 00:57:44,047
Get down!
Get off me!

493
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:45,770
Stop it!

494
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:05,364
You've known it all along.

495
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:08,469
The rifles are inside...

496
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:10,968
and you have met him before.

497
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:12,173
Twice...

498
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:13,938
selling guns!

499
00:58:15,223 --> 00:58:16,200
Yes.

500
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:18,025
- To the Cheyenne.
- Yes!

501
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:20,536
To kill American soldiers.

502
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:22,920
And you wouldn't stop him?

503
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,810
I couldn't then. I wouldn't now!

504
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,975
What?

505
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,154
For your own people?

506
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:31,679
Most people I know live in New York City.

507
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:34,565
- For your country then.
- Whose country then?

508
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:37,653
This isn't my country... 
we're in Indian country.

509
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:40,461
OK.

510
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:41,922
Why?

511
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:45,222
Tell me, why did you ever leave the Cheyenne?

512
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:48,133
All right. You really want know?

513
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:49,947
Because they tallk different...

514
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,536
they dress different... .and they eat different.

515
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:56,752
Because I am not a Cheyenne, Solider Blue,
and I never will be.

516
00:58:56,889 --> 00:58:59,813
But I can tell you right now
that I'd rather be one...

517
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,882
than any rump butt soldier...

518
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,693
of any blood thirsty army you can name!

519
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:07,895
You're a traitor, Miss Lee.

520
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:12,753
Well... at least that's settled!

521
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:56,943
Cresta?

522
01:00:00,649 --> 01:00:03,903
Got a good look, did you?
I thought you would.

523
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:09,526
Where is she?
Clunkered!  Got her with my rifle butt.

524
01:00:09,846 --> 01:00:11,383
Over there, by the fire.

525
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,999
Don't worry soldier.
She ain't marked now and that won't show a bit.

526
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:22,177
♪ I've got a heart full of love
For every star in the sky, ♪

527
01:00:22,178 --> 01:00:28,578

530
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,469
Bite it.

531
01:00:56,948 --> 01:00:57,978
What?

532
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:01,139
Use your teeth.

533
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,310
What's the matter!

534
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:21,876
Honus?

535
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:27,631
What're you doing?

536
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:42,761
Sorry!

537
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,502
Never mind. Keep at it!

538
01:01:46,005 --> 01:01:46,950
Are you all right?

539
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:19,707
Look at it, would ya!
Nature's wonderland.

540
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:24,742
Out here I feel I'm close
to the great secret of life itself.

541
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,124
Honest to God, ah.

542
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:31,533
I get sort of choked up inside.

543
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:33,232
- Maggot!
- Eh... what?

544
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,627
I called you a maggot!

545
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,799
A maggot?

546
01:02:39,307 --> 01:02:41,029
Heh, heh! Maggot!

547
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:45,225
Huh, the tiniest creature in God's universe.

548
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:48,558
And which one of us is any better?
You? Me? Him?

549
01:02:48,794 --> 01:02:52,474
I wouldn't count on it.
There's only one thing certain right now Missy.

550
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:55,649
Pretty soon you're gonna be back in the arms 
of your loved one, and...

551
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:59,199
you can bet ol' Spotted Wolf
is gonna be just a-itchin' to get his hands on you.

552
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:01,687
Are you planning to starve us for.

553
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:05,008
If I know Spotted Wolf, he's gonna want
somethin' real plump to get his hands on.

554
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,047
Hah, Hah, how about it Missy?

555
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,464
What about a juicy rump steak?  Huh?

556
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:14,766
Heh, heh. Ought to be a young pronghorn
around here somewheres.

557
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:16,148
Heh, heh.

558
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:26,844
You got any sweet nothin's left, soldier,
you'd better say'em now. 

559
01:03:27,632 --> 01:03:30,956
- Quick! Come on, get at 'em!
- I can't!

560
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:33,673
- Why not?
- I haven't got any spit left to chew with.

561
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,310
Chew dry!
Come on!

562
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:48,476
That's it!

563
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:52,011
Come on!

564
01:03:54,224 --> 01:03:55,484
It's coming, I can feel it!

565
01:03:55,884 --> 01:03:56,736
A little harder.

566
01:03:57,933 --> 01:03:59,325
Pull!
Pull!

567
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:00,030
Good!

569
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:04,345
Come on Honus!

570
01:04:05,725 --> 01:04:06,388
It's coming.

571
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:07,547
Pull!

572
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:10,441
A little.
I got it Honus!

574
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:27,626
- Give me your feet, soldier.
- What?

575
01:04:28,024 --> 01:04:32,172
I'll cut your feet loose, but that's all.
Then we get right out of here.

576
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:33,577
What about the guns?

577
01:04:33,848 --> 01:04:35,270
They stay where they are.

578
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:38,843
You're going to let him bring those guns in now, 
when you know what they will be used for?

579
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:41,349
I'm giving the Cheyenne something to keep them alive.

580
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:45,788
Nobody's going to murder them.  
They'll be given land, a place to live in peace.

581
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,548
Bull shit!

582
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:49,121
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose.

583
01:04:49,142 --> 01:04:51,528
Not your hands, just your feet.

584
01:06:06,116 --> 01:06:08,939
He's got the only saddle.
We'll have to ride out bareback.

585
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,285
What the hell are you doing?

586
01:06:23,131 --> 01:06:25,289
What do you want? A medal?

587
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:26,615
Come on!

588
01:06:49,033 --> 01:06:49,641
Get up!

589
01:07:06,927 --> 01:07:07,449
Get up!

590
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,717
Get the horse!

591
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,813
- Ahh!
- Honus?

592
01:07:55,095 --> 01:07:56,879
Honus!
Come on, get up here.

593
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:57,748
You can make it.

594
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:02,084
- Ride! Go on, get out of here.
- Get up here you son of a bitch..

595
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,513
Get up boy!

596
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:02,983
Get up!

597
01:09:06,507 --> 01:09:07,250
Giah!

598
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:18,141
Look... ooh.

599
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:19,692
Oh, eh!

606
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:47,467
Get up!
Get up!

608
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:54,935
Honus we gotta to keep going.

609
01:09:55,443 --> 01:09:58,353
Honus, he's following us.

610
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:33,586
Hang on, dammit.
Hang on!

611
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:59,439
Whoa, come back here, come on back.
Wait!

614
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:30,386
Honus, shut up.

615
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:38,577
For God's sake.
Shut up, dammit! 

617
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,518
How's your leg?

618
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:05,081
Still moves!

619
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,644
You're lucky.
That bullet went clean through.

620
01:16:10,592 --> 01:16:14,520
- It's my, ah, head that hurts.
- Oh?

621
01:16:16,629 --> 01:16:20,205
Here. I want you to eat some of these.
It'll make you feel better.

622
01:16:27,445 --> 01:16:33,333
It's good. What is it?
Have some more.

623
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:40,210
I chewed up some roots and packed them right there, 
in your wound. It kills the poison.

624
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:47,528
Big 'Injun medicine, you know. Wouldn't think your everyday 
savage would have time for medicine, would you?

625
01:16:48,832 --> 01:16:57,308
- No, I guess not.
- Anyway, you're lookin' um... pretty good now, Honus.

626
01:16:57,933 --> 01:16:59,599
How about you?

627
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:02,428
Me?

628
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:09,620
Oh, ah.
Here, have some more of this.

629
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:17,090
- Hah, you haven't told me what it is.
- Hocheeka.

630
01:17:19,195 --> 01:17:20,192
It's snake.

631
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,309
Snake?

632
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,117
You've got to cook it just right.

633
01:17:30,948 --> 01:17:33,318
I bet you do.

635
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:46,785
So...

636
01:17:49,246 --> 01:17:54,592
You look... better than I've ever seen you before.

637
01:17:55,056 --> 01:18:02,230
You look all... shiny and... and beautiful.

638
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:05,845
Like an angel.

639
01:18:11,197 --> 01:18:12,282
Cresta.

640
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:32,466
What the hell you doing?

641
01:18:44,883 --> 01:18:46,938
God, what was in that snake.

642
01:18:48,038 --> 01:18:49,143
No.

643
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,592
It's not the snake.

644
01:19:01,252 --> 01:19:03,989
- You've got your fever back.
- No.

645
01:19:09,181 --> 01:19:13,593
Hey!  Look at me. I'm a traitor, remember?

646
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:15,427
Uh huh... I know.

647
01:19:17,148 --> 01:19:20,059
And for God's sake,
look at the way I swear all the time..

648
01:19:20,348 --> 01:19:21,494
That's true.

649
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:26,648
Well.

650
01:19:28,788 --> 01:19:32,879
- Well, how the hell. how can you tell.
- I'd rather not tell you anything.

651
01:19:33,356 --> 01:19:33,924
Huh?

652
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:40,358
I'd rather hold you, Cresta Maribel Lee.

653
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:44,102
Damn.

654
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,067
Cresta.

655
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:59,525
Don't!
Please to God, don't.

656
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:03,592
Not unless you mean it.

657
01:20:13,692 --> 01:20:17,688
The whole shaboodle.

658
01:21:34,018 --> 01:21:35,673
Cresta!

659
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:41,338
Cresta!

660
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:45,459
Cresta!

661
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:12,840
Come on! Honus!

662
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:17,495
- I'm trying to be serious.
- I am serious.

663
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:22,358
Naa... I've been thinking.
I should just go on.

664
01:22:22,519 --> 01:22:25,869
- What, alone?
- I can travel a lot faster alone...

665
01:22:25,879 --> 01:22:32,617
and then I'd come back here for you.
With...with real food, and a horse, and... clean socks.

666
01:22:33,977 --> 01:22:36,665
We are going back together.

667
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:42,232
You and me... we're here Honus.
Don't you see?

668
01:22:42,313 --> 01:22:45,635
The two of us, right here. That's all.

669
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:50,736
We can't be any place else.

670
01:22:52,205 --> 01:22:55,680
When we go back, it's not ''we'' anymore.

671
01:24:23,961 --> 01:24:27,549
Excuse me.
Sir, I'm sorry to break in on you like this.

672
01:24:27,618 --> 01:24:28,992
My name's Cresta Maribel Lee.

673
01:24:29,096 --> 01:24:30,468
<i>Cresta!</i>

674
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,213
Johnny?

675
01:24:36,428 --> 01:24:37,351
Cresta!

676
01:24:40,766 --> 01:24:42,137
I could'ave swore.

677
01:24:43,277 --> 01:24:47,266
Cresta, I can't. I just can't believe it.

678
01:24:53,242 --> 01:24:56,110
My God!  I'm only asking for two lousy troopers.

679
01:24:56,482 --> 01:24:58,258
How hard is that then?

680
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:01,775
It's out of the question, Miss Lee.
I'm sorry, it can't be done.

681
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:05,756
- He'll last two weeks if he's lucky.
- Yes, well perhaps by that time...

682
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:07,743
I may be able to send some help.

683
01:25:07,891 --> 01:25:09,789
Well, that's mighty big of you buster.

684
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:11,101
Cresta!.
Give me a horse and supplies...

685
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:12,504
I'll go myself.

686
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
Miss Lee, this is wild country.

687
01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:17,960
I'm sorry; I can't allow you to go out there by yourself.

688
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:20,441
Well, how the hell do you think I got here?

689
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:21,208
Cresta!

691
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:26,592
Excuse me sir, but do you think
I could have a few moments alone with Miss Lee?

692
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,554
I think you should, McNair.
I suggest a long and sober talk.

693
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:35,592
- Yes... Well, thank you, sir... if you'll excuse me, sir.
- Indeed!

694
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:40,685
- You know, Mitchel.
- Yes, sir?

695
01:25:41,112 --> 01:25:46,417
When I see young people, today,
behaving like that, I just...

696
01:25:46,534 --> 01:25:50,003
I can't help wondering what
this God-damned country is coming to?

697
01:25:51,803 --> 01:25:56,008
When we get home we're going to be married,
aren't we? What's so terrible about wanting to...

698
01:25:56,435 --> 01:25:59,408
- Get together with my bro.
- Well, nothing, but, I mean, don't we even...

699
01:25:59,498 --> 01:26:02,906
get to say "hello" first?
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

700
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:06,369
- You got no reason to swear.
- Swear?

701
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:09,791
- Me, swear?
- You can send someone after Honus.

702
01:26:09,839 --> 01:26:12,577
- We can't. Not for a while.
- Why not?

703
01:26:13,762 --> 01:26:18,553
Cheyenne... And you, more than anyone.
Ought to appreciate that.

704
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,157
- You'll never find'em.
- Oh, we already have.

705
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:23,231
- We know exactly where they are.
- Where?

706
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:28,140
Oh just... just a little west of here.
Up by the twin rock pass, the Jewels Pass.

707
01:26:28,612 --> 01:26:30,948
- Are you sure of that?
- Of course.

708
01:26:31,498 --> 01:26:34,132
We should be inside of their campground by tomorrow.

709
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:41,689
You know. There's only one thing wrong with me, Johnny.

710
01:26:41,799 --> 01:26:45,881
It's been so long... so very long.

711
01:26:46,463 --> 01:26:49,844
- Oh, yeah!
- But now we're together.

712
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:51,110
Yes!

713
01:26:51,692 --> 01:26:58,592
Well... it's just that... I haven't had anything to eat
in two days, and I'm just so hungry.

714
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:02,467
- I don't know what I'm saying.
- Hungry?

715
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:09,904
If we could just have... a little something...
out on the tall grass, there.

716
01:27:10,178 --> 01:27:16,665
Oh, yeah... of course. 
I'll... I'll be right back.

717
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:32,168
Excuse me, miss?.
What are you doing?

718
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:33,428
Ah... shit!

719
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:40,176
It's all right.
He's my fiancée.

720
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:46,153
By.

721
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:13,642
Uh!

722
01:28:14,893 --> 01:28:15,638
Whoa, boy.

723
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:19,764
Whoa, boy.

724
01:28:20,398 --> 01:28:21,192
Whoa.

725
01:29:32,464 --> 01:29:36,371
- Cresta.
- Wantehemo.

726
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:47,544
<i>Right, men. Put into your minds the dark
abominations... of these Godless barbarians.</i>

727
01:29:48,636 --> 01:29:49,763
Murder.

728
01:29:50,526 --> 01:29:51,718
Rape.

729
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,363
Torture.

730
01:29:55,164 --> 01:30:00,740
And when you think of your comerades...
fallen, butchered comerades...

731
01:30:01,385 --> 01:30:06,786
Ask yourself.
Are we going to give them the same mercy?

732
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,506
You just bet we are.

733
01:30:14,177 --> 01:30:15,707
Major Phillips.
Take over.

734
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,081
Advance!

735
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:22,262
McNair?
Move out!

736
01:30:27,086 --> 01:30:28,637
Any word about your... uh.

737
01:30:29,777 --> 01:30:31,860
- Financée?
- No, sir.

738
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:33,843
I'm afraid she's...

739
01:30:34,143 --> 01:30:37,429
Well, I think she's hopelessly infatuated with Private Gent.

740
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:42,493
Ah, that's too bad.
I'm going to ride in the wagon.

741
01:30:42,635 --> 01:30:44,635
My back is killing me again.

750

- Well?
- It could be the two rear flankers, sir.

751
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,808
- Except that there's three of them.
- Let me have those.

752
01:31:54,404 --> 01:31:56,360
We found this man riding through Lever's Pass, sir.

753
01:31:57,443 --> 01:31:59,156
It's not a cavalry mount.

754
01:31:59,927 --> 01:32:02,782
No, sir.
If I may, sir.

755
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:09,019
- I'm attached to the Colorado 11th Volunteers.
- We're the Colorado 11th Volunteers.

756
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:14,108
Yes, sir!
I'm Private Honus Gent, reporting.

757
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:16,043
You?

758
01:32:21,126 --> 01:32:26,143
<i>- Cannons.
- Many soldiers and guns.</i>

759
01:32:27,499 --> 01:32:30,699
<i>You must leave.</i>

760
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,856
<i>We want no war.</i>

761
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,636
<i>Your people gave me.</i>

762
01:32:41,905 --> 01:32:43,101
<i>A flag.</i>

763
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:45,192
<i>And a medal of friendship.</i>

764
01:32:46,056 --> 01:32:48,192
<i>I do not trust them.</i>

765
01:32:50,186 --> 01:32:52,420
<i>They will kill our people.</i>

766
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:58,843
<i>We will fight.</i>

767
01:32:58,853 --> 01:33:00,267
<i>I say peace.</i>

768
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:18,588
<i>You do not wear your necklace.
My gift of love.</i>

769
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:27,977
<i>You gave it to someone.</i>

770
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:31,932
Yes... and I must go to him.</i>

771
01:33:46,604 --> 01:33:52,504
My heart torn by all this.
Behavo.

772
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:58,199
If you'd let me talk to her for just a few minutes
she might convince Spotted Wolf to give up without a fight.

773
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,501
Without a fight?

774
01:33:59,891 --> 01:34:03,230
We destroyed the rifles they were counting on,
so they can't possibly win.

775
01:34:03,909 --> 01:34:06,077
- There's just no sense to it.
- Private Gent!

776
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:10,840
I don't know what sort of relationship
you and this woman have had.

777
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,592
But I can assure you that
my men are prepared to move...

778
01:34:13,613 --> 01:34:15,276
against the enemy at daybreak.

779
01:34:15,599 --> 01:34:17,844
- And move they will.
- Sir! 

780
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,733
Twenty-one of your own comerades
murdered. Cut to pieces.

781
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:22,768
- I know, sir.
- The price will be paid, soldier.

782
01:34:27,034 --> 01:34:29,034
- Is it worth it?
- Dismissed!

783
01:34:31,947 --> 01:34:34,141
Yes, sir.

784
01:34:59,714 --> 01:35:01,715
Prepare to fire.

785
01:35:18,308 --> 01:35:21,213
There just seems to be normal activity over there, sir.

786
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:27,434
The cannon will commence firing at 7:30.
Six rounds apiece until we find the range.

788
01:35:43,535 --> 01:35:47,037
And I know, McNair,
I know she's in there someplace.

789
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,971
No matter what we might think of her
she's still a white woman.

790
01:35:50,299 --> 01:35:51,862
That can't be helped.

791
01:35:52,661 --> 01:35:53,104
No, sir.

792
01:35:54,975 --> 01:35:56,108
Can I depend on you?

793
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:58,955
I will do my duty, sir..

794
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:01,938
Good.
Good.

795
01:36:09,334 --> 01:36:11,197
All right, Lieutenant.
Give the order.

796
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:15,171
- They're coming out, sir!
- What? What's that?

797
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:18,803
- I think it's Spotted Wolf!
- My God, sir. He's got a flag of truce.

798
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:21,506
- Yes, sir. It's a white flag.
- Nonsense!

799
01:36:21,831 --> 01:36:23,995
- Will you see for yourself.
- I told you Lieutenant. Give the order!

800
01:36:24,854 --> 01:36:25,237
Sir?

801
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:26,511
Well, give the order!

802
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:28,433
Yes, sir.

803
01:36:29,911 --> 01:36:31,457
Open fire!

804
01:36:32,231 --> 01:36:33,041
Ready.

805
01:36:34,681 --> 01:36:36,932
Cover ears.
Fire!

806
01:36:50,033 --> 01:36:54,004
All pieces, increase elevation one degree.

807
01:36:54,514 --> 01:36:56,514
Fire when ready.

808
01:37:29,684 --> 01:37:30,769
They've the range now.

809
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:31,908
Stop!

810
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:32,983
Stop!

811
01:37:33,418 --> 01:37:34,111
Gent!

812
01:37:34,303 --> 01:37:35,643
Stay away from that cannon!

813
01:37:36,342 --> 01:37:37,267
No!

814
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:38,621
Arrest him!

815
01:37:39,297 --> 01:37:39,826
Stop!

816
01:37:40,093 --> 01:37:41,055
Arrest that man!

817
01:37:43,287 --> 01:37:45,753
No!
No. There's a white woman in that.

818
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:49,276
Colonel look. They're attacking.

819
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:56,391
Bugeler, sound Alert.

820
01:38:23,404 --> 01:38:26,626
Soldiers!
After those bastards!

821
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:37,186
Main troops. Form covering party.
Brace for incoming.

822
01:38:37,285 --> 01:38:39,446
Company ride. Forward!

823
01:38:45,049 --> 01:38:47,143
Form three ranks.

824
01:38:49,702 --> 01:38:51,046
Charge!

825
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,830
Line up the front.

826
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:37,898
Troops.
Rally to your Guidons.

827
01:40:49,214 --> 01:40:54,150
McNair, form these troops in two columns
on the left and right.

828
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:57,406
Advance at full gallop
attacking the village on both flanks.

829
01:40:57,856 --> 01:40:59,249
You take the left, I'll take the right.

830
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,975
Artillery pieces, cease firing.

831
01:41:07,147 --> 01:41:10,400
We'll attack... right of the village.

832
01:41:12,321 --> 01:41:17,521
Troops, at the front.
March!

833
01:41:23,707 --> 01:41:28,942
Troops, by the front. March.

834
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:15,381
Halt!

835
01:42:59,903 --> 01:43:01,629
Charge!

836
01:43:47,996 --> 01:43:49,612
Are you OK, Colonel?

837
01:43:49,876 --> 01:43:50,376
I'm all right.

838
01:43:52,163 --> 01:43:55,944
McNair. Raze the village!

839
01:43:56,806 --> 01:43:59,872
Burn this... pestilence!

840
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:18,968
Keewa!

841
01:45:19,885 --> 01:45:19,155
Keewa!

842
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:22,309
Keewa!

843
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:24,766
Keewa!

844
01:45:26,341 --> 01:45:27,592
Keewa!

845
01:45:40,177 --> 01:45:41,037
Cresta!

846
01:45:46,387 --> 01:45:47,425
Cresta!

847
01:45:53,147 --> 01:45:54,355
Cresta!

848
01:46:05,946 --> 01:46:07,355
Hold his legs.

849
01:46:36,087 --> 01:46:38,256
Please, please... please

850
01:46:46,996 --> 01:46:48,055
Please.

851
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:50,738
Please.
Please.

852
01:47:12,212 --> 01:47:15,302
Yahooo!

853
01:47:24,045 --> 01:47:25,835
Get that white woman out of there.

854
01:48:15,003 --> 01:48:16,938
I'll put one poor devil out of its misery.

855
01:48:20,394 --> 01:48:22,248
Damn you!

856
01:48:22,269 --> 01:48:23,439
What are you doing?

857
01:48:26,966 --> 01:48:29,941
- Why? Why? Why?
- Shut up, Honus!

858
01:48:39,859 --> 01:48:40,810
He's gone mad.

859
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:53,271
Cresta.

860
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:06,641
Got a prayer, Soldier Blue?

861
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:07,681
A nice poem?

862
01:50:11,578 --> 01:50:13,400
Say something pretty.

863
01:50:23,445 --> 01:50:25,001
And to each of you.

864
01:50:26,066 --> 01:50:28,234
To officer and soldier alike.

865
01:50:29,925 --> 01:50:33,800
I offer my most profound admiration...

866
01:50:34,767 --> 01:50:36,500
my deepest affection...

867
01:50:36,962 --> 01:50:40,187
and my overwhelming gratitude...
for a job well done.

868
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:44,500
You men here today...

869
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:49,045
have succeeded...
at making another part of America...

870
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:51,577
a decent place for people to live.

871
01:50:52,707 --> 01:50:54,900
We have given the Injun...

872
01:50:56,326 --> 01:50:58,535
a lesson he will not soon forget.

873
01:51:00,603 --> 01:51:03,400
But more than that...

874
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,900
for the rest of your lives.

875
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,100
You men will hold your heads proud...

876
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,300
when this day is mentioned...

877
01:51:11,217 --> 01:51:12,566
and you will say "Yes!"


878
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:15,500
I was with Iverson!

879
01:51:32,784 --> 01:51:37,100
The Eleventh Colorado Volunteers.
Move out!

880
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:12,233
Cresta.

881
01:53:36,263 --> 01:53:39,446
<i>On November 29th, 1864...</i>

882
01:53:39,616 --> 01:53:44,200
<i>a unit of Colorado cavalry,
numbering over 700 men...</i>

883
01:53:44,577 --> 01:53:48,226
<i>attacked a peaceful Cheyenne village
at Sand Creek, Colorado.</i>

884
01:53:49,252 --> 01:53:53,532
<i>The Indians raised the American Flag
and a white flag of surrender.</i>

885
01:53:54,267 --> 01:53:59,458
<i>Nevertheless the cavalry attacked.
massacring 500 Indians...</i>

886
01:53:59,854 --> 01:54:02,411
<i>more than half of whom
were women and children.</i>

887
01:54:03,282 --> 01:54:05,466
<i>Over one hundred scalps were taken...</i>

888
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:07,277
<i>bodies dismembered...</i>

889
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:09,889
<i>plus numerous reports of rape.</i>

890
01:54:10,990 --> 01:54:13,002
<i>General Nelson A. Miles...</i>

891
01:54:13,374 --> 01:54:14,691
<i>Army Chief of Staff...</i>

892
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:16,584
<i>termed the massacre...</i>

893
01:54:17,018 --> 01:54:19,958
<i>perhaps the foulest and most unjust crime...</i>

894
01:54:20,534 --> 01:54:22,273
<i>in the annals of America.</i>
