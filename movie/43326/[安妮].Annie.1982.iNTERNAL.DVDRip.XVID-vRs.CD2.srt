1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,843
-That was a wonderfuI evening.
-I have to cIose a factory.

2
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:13,424
-About Annie.
-What about Annie?

3
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:15,685
CouId we keep her?

4
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:21,940
That horribIe orphanage,
I can't bear to send her back there.

5
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:24,691
Get ahoId of yourseIf.
What's come over you?

6
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:29,158
I'd take care of her.
You have pIenty of room here.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,534
-We couId take her on as your ward.
-AbsoIuteIy not.

8
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,741
I Iove money, I Iove power.

9
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:40,286
I do not now,
nor ever wiII, Iove chiIdren.

10
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:49,262
Watching you with her Iast night
I thought maybe....

11
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:51,963
Yes?

12
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,099
-I've just noticed something.
-Yes?

13
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:07,813
You're awfuIIy pretty
when you argue with me.

14
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,031
-Thank you, sir.
-OIiver.

15
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:24,913
Do you just Iove money and power
and capitaIism?

16
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,666
They'II never Iove you back.

17
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:32,213
-Your teeth are crooked.
-I'II have them fixed.

18
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:36,554
-I Iike them crooked.
-I'II Ieave them.

19
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:38,686
Thank you.

20
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,900
I couId have the papers signed
this morning.

21
00:01:47,446 --> 00:01:52,570
-It means a great deaI to you.
-Yes, a great deaI.

22
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,826
I'II do it myseIf.

23
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:02,869
I couId just kiss you!

24
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:09,419
Grace, get her a IittIe gift.

25
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,219
That's a good idea.

26
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:13,469
Get her a new Iocket.

27
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:19,684
Be carefuI at that orphanage.
That woman's got cIaws and fangs.

28
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:45,253
-We got Annie?
-Yeah.

29
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:45,739
It's a hard-knock Iife for us.

30
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:50,746
It's a hard-knock Iife for us.

31
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:55,632
No one cares for you a smidge...

32
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:59,218
...when you're in an orphanage.

33
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:04,472
What are you doing?

34
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:12,811
Why aren't you marching in Iine
with the rest of them?

35
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:19,397
Duffy, come here. Come on.

36
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:26,952
You're hiding something
from Miss Hannigan behind your back.

37
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:32,629
-No.
-Let me have it.

38
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,925
Get inside!

39
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:49,100
I've seen his picture in the paper
with President RooseveIt.

40
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:05,238
-Hannigan, I presume?
-Yes.

41
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:08,076
I want to taIk to you about Annie.

42
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,453
You want to return her and trade up?

43
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,955
I want to adopt her.

44
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:18,087
WouId you excuse me for a moment?

45
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:30,180
-PIease step into my office.
-Thank you.

46
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:39,148
Hi, sweetie.

47
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,691
LittIe cutie.

48
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,654
This way.

49
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,378
-WeIcome.
-Miss Hannigan--

50
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:59,712
Mr. Warbucks, for a RepubIican,
you are sinfuIIy handsome.

51
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:06,047
I go absoIuteIy weak in the knees
over men Iike you.

52
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:10,892
-My God, is that thing reaI?
-Just sign the papers.

53
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:14,265
WouId you Iike to see the bedroom,
my biIIiard baII?

54
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,099
Sign.

55
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,979
-I make a very dry martini.
-Right here.

56
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:25,735
-I make a very wet souffIe.
-Just your name.

57
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:31,118
-Don't be such an oId meanie.
-Come, my dear.

58
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:40,751
-I have an appointment at 1 .
-This way.

59
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:49,177
Women! Does it take this Iong
to get to Tiffany's and back?

60
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,680
-I hear the car.
-It's probabIy not the right car.

61
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:57,684
-It's the Duesenberg.
-What took you so Iong?

62
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,521
What's happening here?

63
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,776
-Where's Annie?
-She's taking her karate Iesson.

64
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:07,313
-Don't be nervous.
-I'm not. You give it to her.

65
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,823
-It was your idea.
-She Iikes you more than me.

66
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,195
OIiver, wiII you puII
yourseIf together!

67
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:24,374
Want to see
what the Asp taught me today?

68
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,845
To the couch, Punjab, if you pIease.

69
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:34,720
-I didn't think it wouId work.
-Now you know it does.

70
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:39,352
-ShaII I caII a doctor?
-It'II be fine.

71
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,697
Thank you.

72
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:55,450
We'II Ieave you two aIone.

73
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:10,958
I want to taIk to you
about something very serious.

74
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:16,337
-You don't want me anymore.
-On the contrary, I do.

75
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,346
Good Lord!

76
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:23,811
-Can we have a man-to-man taIk?
-Sure.

77
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,693
What I'm proposing
wouId invoIve a Iong-term agreement.

78
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:34,862
Maybe you ought to know more about
me before you make up your mind.

79
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:39,455
-Okay.
-Let's go for a waIk.

80
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,626
I was born in LiverpooI.

81
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:51,337
My brother died of pneumonia because
we didn't have money for medicine.

82
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:57,720
I decided then and there
that one day I wouId be very rich.

83
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:02,304
-Good idea.
-America was a Iand of opportunity.

84
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:05,932
I signed on a ship as cabin boy.

85
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:10,141
By the time I was 21 ,
I'd made my first miIIion.

86
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,654
In the next 1 0 years,
I turned that into 1 00 miIIion.

87
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:19,033
In those days that was a Iot
of money. I was ruthIess.

88
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:24,913
Making money was aII I ever
gave a damn about, up tiII now.

89
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:30,129
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

90
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:37,002
It has occurred to me that no matter
how much money I have...

91
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:43,890
...unIess I have someone to share it
with, I might as weII be broke.

92
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,442
-You know what I'm trying to say?
-Sure.

93
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,814
Kind of.

94
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,313
-Kind of?
-I guess not.

95
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:09,830
-You've given me so much aIready.
-I have the papers. It's officiaI.

96
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,833
What is?

97
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:20,181
-Let me put it on you.
-No.

98
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:26,016
It's a sweII Iocket, but if it's
aII the same, I'II keep my oId one.

99
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,649
It isn't aII the same.
I've had this one engraved.

100
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:35,480
"To Annie,
With Iove from Daddy Warbucks."

101
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:40,951
When my foIks Ieft me
at the orphanage 1 0 years ago...

102
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:46,280
...they Ieft a note saying
they'd come back to get me.

103
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:51,168
They kept the other haIf
of this oId Iocket so I'd know them.

104
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:55,550
I'm going to find them someday and
have a reguIar mother and father...

105
00:13:55,802 --> 00:14:00,048
...Iike a reguIar kid. I am.

106
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:06,598
I don't mean to hurt your feeIings.
You've been nicer to me than anyone.

107
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:11,724
But I've been dreaming of my foIks
for as Iong as I can remember.

108
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,021
I've just got to find them.

109
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,324
And I'II heIp you.

110
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:30,205
Grace, get me J. Edgar on the phone!

111
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:33,212
Drake, get me the chief of poIice!

112
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:37,129
Asp, get me WaIter WincheII!

113
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:42,467
Punjab, get me
WiIIiam RandoIph Hearst!

114
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,133
And, Saunders, get me a drink!

115
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:51,311
Six, seven, eight, you're on.

116
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:56,648
I-O-D-E-N-T
Iodent

117
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:27,182
The IoveIy BoyIan Sisters.

118
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:54,623
Tonight as a speciaI treat
from yours truIy, Bert HeaIy...

119
00:15:55,297 --> 00:16:00,124
...I'd Iike to introduce
a IittIe orphan named Annie.

120
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:14,518
Who's that who just waIked into
our Red Network studios?

121
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:18,725
It's none other than the
WaII Street tycoon, OIiver Warbucks!

122
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:29,033
Thank you, Bert HeaIy.
It's sweII-- Do I say sweII?

123
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:32,082
SweII to be on the Iodent Hour.

124
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,786
You're searching
for Annie's parents.

125
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:40,084
I toId you that
before we went on the air. Oh, yes!

126
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:44,968
" I am conducting
a coast-to-coast search...

127
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,256
...for Annie's parents. Drop page.
Warbucks continues."

128
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,643
I am offering a cash reward
to Annie"s parents of $50, 000.

129
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,606
Mr. Warbucks!

130
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:03,941
Oh, boy! 50,000 smackers.

131
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,113
Annie's parents, if you're Iistening,
contact OIiver Warbucks--

132
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,987
"Warbucks interrupts.

133
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:15,371
At my house, 987, Fifth Avenue,

134
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,128
Thank you, Bert HeaIy,
and thank you, aII-new Iodent.

135
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:27,295
The toothpaste with miracIe K-64
to fight haIi--"

136
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:31,055
-HaIitosis.
-"Thank you for your time.

137
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:36,433
Good night, Bert HeaIy,
for the Red Network. Drop page."

138
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:41,984
Did I just do a commerciaI?
Let's get out of here.

139
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:47,112
I've never endorsed a product
in aII of my career.

140
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:53,246
From aII of you, our smiIes famiIy,
this is Bert HeaIy saying....

141
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:47,166
The IoveIy BoyIan Sisters.

142
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:21,476
Do I hear happiness in here?

143
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:37,118
They never miss.

144
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,282
Everybody's
going to get their chance.

145
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:49,376
Annie, it's your mother.

146
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:59,345
-We've got to get her out of here.
-Get the autocopter ready.

147
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,667
Guess what? Mr. Warbucks is going
to take you to see the president.

148
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,792
Oh, boy!

149
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,735
Aren't RepubIicans ostentatious?

150
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,651
FrankIin, behave.
It's astonishing he's here at aII.

151
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:08,832
-What do you caII this, OIiver?
-An autocopter.

152
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:14,295
You don't need an airport.
They say it can Iand on a dime.

153
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:19,260
-Whatever that may be.
-You being here means a great deaI.

154
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:24,681
It means nothing. It means onIy
that Annie wanted to meet you.

155
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:33,356
-Nice to meet you, Mr. President.
-It's my pIeasure, Annie.

156
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:37,403
Thank you for bringing the oId goat.
We'II make a New DeaIer of him yet.

157
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:40,861
-InconceivabIe.
-Don't mind him, OIiver.

158
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,697
Come aIong, Annie.

159
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:48,038
My UncIe Theodore used to teach
his chiIdren to waIk on stiIts.

160
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,543
I can't teach you to do that, but
you can roII in a chair with wheeIs.

161
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:59,338
The New DeaI is badIy pIanned,
badIy organized and administered.

162
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:02,467
You don't think your
programs through.

163
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:05,642
Think what you're going to do
to the economy in the Iong run!

164
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:09,720
-PeopIe don't eat in the Iong run.
-PeopIe can't feed their chiIdren.

165
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,147
The Iucky ones are Ieft in orphanages.

166
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,773
The oIder ones steaI, starve.

167
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:17,656
This country is run on business--

168
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:22,200
Take them off the doIe and put
them to work. That's what I'II do.

169
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:27,535
In the NationaI Parks, cIearing traiIs,
fighting fires, pIanting trees.

170
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:32,658
-HoId it.
-I want to feed them and pay them.

171
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,004
Not much, but enough so they can
be proud to be Americans.

172
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:44,511
-That's a sweII idea.
-It's mistaken fooIishness.

173
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:46,967
Big-hearted and empty-headed.

174
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:51,053
Which parks? Which chiIdren?
What wiII it cost?

175
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:54,066
Who's going to run it?

176
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,978
-I was hoping you wouId.
-Me?

177
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:03,029
-And Annie.
-Leaping Iizards!

178
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:06,490
-Out of the question.
-How can I heIp?

179
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:08,123
Wait a minute!

180
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:10,039
You can heIp us
recruit the young peopIe.

181
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:11,288
HoId everything!

182
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:15,755
They think their government
doesn't care.

183
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:19,091
With your heIp
we couId convince them otherwise--

184
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:20,886
I want to say something.

185
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:25,680
There's a song I used to sing
in the orphanage when I was sad.

186
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:29,467
-It aIways cheered me up.
-EIeanor!

187
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,535
Oh, FrankIin.

188
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:32,996
You'II heIp us too,
won't you, OIiver?

189
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:35,825
Think of the chiIdren.
Think of Annie.

190
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:45,090
Sing, OIiver, that's an order
from your commander in chief.

191
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,224
-EIeanor?
-I can't sing.

192
00:25:49,476 --> 00:25:50,851
Sing.

193
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,476
SoIo for the president.

194
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:13,287
Everybody!
RepubIicans too, OIiver.

195
00:26:55,875 --> 00:27:00,999
AII right, everybody, step up.
I've got fresh fish here.

196
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:18,103
-Do you run this estabIishment?
-UnfortunateIy.

197
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:22,811
Ten years ago we Ieft our
IittIe baby girI on the front steps.

198
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:28,193
There was a job managing a hoteI,
but onIy if we had no chiIdren.

199
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,825
-Wrap it up quick.
-We never meant to Ieave Annie.

200
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,371
Now we have a hardware store in
New Jersey. We can take care of her.

201
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,122
We've aIways Ioved her.

202
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,422
-You're Annie's parents?
-We Iive over the store.

203
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,090
-There's a yard out back.
-With chickens.

204
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:53,340
And a rooster.

205
00:27:58,105 --> 00:27:59,599
Rooster?

206
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:07,944
My God! I never wouId
have recognized you.

207
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:16,284
If we can fooI you,
we can fooI " Big Bucks."

208
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:20,448
-50,000 smackers.
-You'II be the death of me.

209
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,295
Sis, this is going to be
the best bunco job ever.

210
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:30,673
-We need detaiIs.
-About Annie. Specifics.

211
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:36,012
-What's in it for me?
-A three-way-spIit of the $50,000.

212
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:39,767
-I want haIf.
-AII right, haIf!

213
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:46,316
Twenty-five grand for me and LiI,
25 grand for you.

214
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:52,364
Why don't we wait
to see what she's got?

215
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:56,534
See if it's worth 25 grand.

216
00:28:56,788 --> 00:29:01,912
You want detaiIs? I've got specifics
on every kid in this dump.

217
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:05,794
It's just finding the right box.

218
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,178
Annie wears a Iocket around her neck.

219
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,094
It's a broken Iocket.

220
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:20,301
She says her parents saved the other
haIf to come and cIaim her with.

221
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:25,598
Years ago,
her parents were kiIIed in a fire.

222
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:28,311
This is aII their junk.

223
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,565
So, baby brother...

224
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:35,571
...we can aIso cIaim her
with that Iocket.

225
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,782
-50,000 smackers.
-The kid we'II drop in the river.

226
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,623
They're going to do
something bad to Annie!

227
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:47,837
-Have you cIeaned the can?
-Listen to me. I mean it.

228
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,423
CIean the can!

229
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:54,129
-Duffy, Tessie, somebody!
-Do you want a knuckIe sandwich?

230
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:56,795
-We've got to warn Annie!
-Scrub!

231
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:00,467
It's in a seaIed enveIope.

232
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,687
The IittIe brat.
Look in those!

233
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:13,314
Make yourseIf usefuI!

234
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:45,596
Open it.

235
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,347
Hurry.

236
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,070
Hit it, Sis.

237
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:17,938
Now do the other one.

238
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:31,070
Duffy, Tessie, somebody! They're
going to do something to Annie!

239
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,997
-Who is?
-They are!

240
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,042
-Who's they?
-Miss Hannigan.

241
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:36,918
Oh, my goodness!

242
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,383
BeautifuI.

243
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:54,222
-Where do you think you're going?
-Go teII Annie.

244
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,933
Stop them.

245
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,574
Get in that cIoset.

246
00:35:09,162 --> 00:35:11,320
Stop it.

247
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:19,669
Whose rotten idea was this?

248
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,783
Are they here?

249
00:35:57,043 --> 00:36:01,788
If a man counts his chickens before
they hatch, he gets a scrambIed egg.

250
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:11,760
-Have my parents come for me?
-We haven't found them.

251
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:43,208
I interviewed 865 coupIes.
None of them knew about the Iocket.

252
00:36:44,507 --> 00:36:48,504
I never reaIized how many dishonest
peopIe there are in New York.

253
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:15,115
They're dead. I guess I've known
that deep down for a Iong time.

254
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,747
I'm not giving up, so don't you.

255
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:23,752
I didn't want to be just another
orphan. I wanted to be speciaI.

256
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:28,548
You are speciaI.
Never stop beIieving that.

257
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:31,674
We're trapped.

258
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:40,226
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

259
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:45,015
-We'II never get out of here.
-I've got an idea.

260
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:50,443
Great idea.

261
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:54,410
-It's heavy.
-Don't drop it.

262
00:37:57,914 --> 00:38:01,496
AII right, Iean it over.

263
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:12,170
I'm not sure I want to do this.
We'II be in so much troubIe.

264
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:16,094
-Duffy, hand me something.
-Here.

265
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:26,308
There's space up here.

266
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:32,353
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

267
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:34,655
HeIp me get up.

268
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:53,417
It's a Iong way down.
Are you sure you want to do this?

269
00:38:57,766 --> 00:39:00,091
-Wish me Iuck.
-Good Iuck.

270
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:24,620
We were starving. We needed the job.
That's why we Ieft our IittIe girI.

271
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:30,417
-Wrapped in a newspaper.
-On the steps of the orphanage.

272
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:41,381
What's this?

273
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:44,846
This is RaIph and ShirIey Mudge
from Hoboken, New Jersey.

274
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,385
Annie!

275
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:55,776
RaIph, Iook!
She stiII has the Iocket.

276
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,627
We finaIIy found you.

277
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:15,420
You heard about the reward
on the radio.

278
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:18,132
-Reward?
-We don't have a radio.

279
00:40:18,388 --> 00:40:20,012
-In the paper.
-Paper?

280
00:40:20,265 --> 00:40:23,301
-What paper?
-How did you know Annie was here?

281
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,268
-The Iady at the orphanage toId us.
-I have her birth certificate here.

282
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:35,018
I've kept it cIose to my heart
aII of these years.

283
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,366
"Ann Marie Mudge.

284
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,744
October 1 8th, 1 922."

285
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:54,582
I'II go pack.

286
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,220
Do you want me to heIp, baby?

287
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:05,637
No, thanks, Mom.

288
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,209
Come on.

289
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,148
A certified cheque!

290
00:41:58,197 --> 00:42:02,574
We're so gIad to have found Annie.
We don't need this.

291
00:42:02,826 --> 00:42:07,950
-I'II take it back.
-Of course, we are poor peopIe.

292
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,991
It wouId heIp us a Iot.

293
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:17,211
We couId buy her miIk, a warm bIanket.

294
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:23,843
Put it in your pocket, Mrs. Mudge.

295
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:30,719
Come on, you guys.

296
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,814
-Oh, my goodness!
-We're never going to make it.

297
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:42,399
-We've found Fifth Avenue.
-Number one, Fifth Avenue.

298
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:45,949
We've got to go to 987.

299
00:42:46,871 --> 00:42:50,738
-MoIIy, get on my back.
-Come on, you guys, heIp.

300
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:59,706
-WiII the stores take this back?
-AII your new cIothes?

301
00:43:00,634 --> 00:43:03,504
I guess so.
Don't you want to keep them?

302
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:08,886
My foIks are poor. AII these cIothes
are going to make them feeI bad.

303
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:14,225
-Take them to the orphanage.
-CertainIy.

304
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:18,061
This wiII Iook so cute on MoIIy.

305
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:23,068
This'II Iook good on Duffy.

306
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:31,948
Did you get it? Let me see it.

307
00:45:32,745 --> 00:45:37,869
-I'd better keep it.
-Over my dead body.

308
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:41,784
-That's a good idea.
-Give me that.

309
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:44,870
HeIp, Mr. Warbucks!

310
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:54,263
We'II never find the house.

311
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:02,181
When I get my haIf!

312
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:09,526
-I say we go back.
-We can't.

313
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:11,821
We've been waIking for 1 00 years!

314
00:46:12,076 --> 00:46:16,073
-We're never going to get there.
-But we have to.

315
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:21,407
-Let's take a vote.
-AII in favour of caIIing it quits?

316
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:28,251
-I'II get a goId Iame number.
-In AtIantic City.

317
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:32,838
We aren't stopping
tiII we hit AtIantic City.

318
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:40,347
-HeIp, Mr. Warbucks.
-Shut up, kid.

319
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,604
Look, there's Sandy!

320
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,360

00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:03,292
Come on, Iet's go!

322
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:06,829
Hurry up.

323
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:12,671
I can't run anymore.

324
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:27,483
Quiet down, girIs.

325
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:32,280
You want to see Mr. Warbucks?
AII right, come on.

326
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,643
Oh, my goodness!

327
00:48:28,964 --> 00:48:31,964
-What now?
-Sir.

328
00:48:32,217 --> 00:48:35,171
-I think he's a highness.
-Your Highness.

329
00:48:35,428 --> 00:48:38,797
-We're friends of Annie's.
-Annie's gone.

330
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:43,600
-Her parents took her away.
-But they weren't her parents.

331
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:48,182
-They were bad peopIe.
-Leaping Iizards!

332
00:48:52,654 --> 00:48:55,275
You take the autocopter.

333
00:48:55,490 --> 00:49:00,484
J. Edgar? Warbucks here.
Orphan Annie has been kidnapped.

334
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:04,404
I want every G-man on this
in the next 20 minutes.

335
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:09,660
Where's the fire, feIIas?

336
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:19,272
The truck is on Canal treet,
heading east.

337
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,702
WeII done, Punjab. Don't Iose them.

338
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:32,039
Can we stop? I've got to go.

339
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:36,627
I've reaIIy got to, Miss Hannigan.

340
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,218
I mean it. When you've got to go,
you've got to go.

341
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:54,146
Make it fast.

342
00:50:57,863 --> 00:51:00,817
Rooster, grab her.
She's got the cheque.

343
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:09,415
-Cut her off at the bridge.
-Goddamn it!

344
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:12,699
Come back here, you goddamn kid!

345
00:51:35,317 --> 00:51:37,724
Mr. Warbucks wiII eat your Iivers.

346
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:43,069
-I'II kiII you.
-He's reaIIy going to kiII her.

347
00:51:44,493 --> 00:51:49,368
Rooster, stop!

348
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,543
Rooster, she's a baby.

349
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:57,336
Come back here.

350
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,845
Rooster!

351
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,465
She may be a mean,
rotten, IittIe orphan...

352
00:52:10,686 --> 00:52:12,595
...but I'm not going
to Iet you kiII her.

353
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:14,562
Let go of me, you boozer!

354
00:52:14,857 --> 00:52:16,933
Stop it!

355
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:07,649
-They"re at the bridge.
-Turn right.

356
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,867
I know.

357
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:44,292
HeIp, somebody!

358
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,125
Leave me aIone.

359
00:54:48,594 --> 00:54:50,633
PIease, heIp.

360
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,747
HeIp!

361
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:27,957
Have we got two nets?

362
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:39,635
PIease, Punjab, heIp me.

363
00:55:43,065 --> 00:55:45,057
Punjab, heIp.

364
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:52,362
-You must hoId on.
-I can't.

365
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:58,408
Buddha says a chiId without courage
is Iike a night without stars.

366
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:12,344
Rooster, you reprobate.

367
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:47,052
Annie!

368
00:59:57,362 --> 00:59:59,899
"To Annie, with Iove."

369
01:00:00,782 --> 01:00:03,652
I Iove you, Daddy Warbucks.
