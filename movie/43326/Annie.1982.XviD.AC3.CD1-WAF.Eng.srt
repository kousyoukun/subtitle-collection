1
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,417
Annie!

2
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,593
Annie!

3
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:19,192
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be aII right.

4
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,235
There, there.

5
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,363
It was onIy a dream, MoIIy.
It's aII right.

6
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:28,024
How am I supposed to get any sIeep?

7
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:31,868
It was onIy a dream.
Everything's aII right.

8
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,578
MoIIy shouIdn't be in this room.

9
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,087
She's a baby.
She cries aII the time.

10
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,833
She wets the bed.

11
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:42,746
I do not!

12
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,630
You're the one who shouIdn't
be in here!

13
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:49,178
Brat, stop!
We're gonna get in troubIe.

14
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:50,630
Go, Duffy! Go!

15
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:54,177
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

16
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,687
Cut it out!

17
00:04:57,273 --> 00:05:01,057
I mean it! Do you want
Miss Hannigan to come in?

18
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,774
Go back to bed.

19
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:10,658
Now. Or you'II have me to deaI with.

20
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,824
BIow it out of your oId wazoo.

21
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,632
CIose your eyes.
Think about your foIks.

22
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,168
You're the onIy one who has foIks.

23
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,126
Mine are dead.

24
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,636
Think about the foIks who
want to adopt you...

25
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:36,102
...because they want a IittIe girI with
brown hair and brown eyes.

26
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,708
Oh, my goodness.

27
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:39,495
Did I hear singing in here?

28
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:49,510
AII right. Fine.

29
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:53,253
Since we're aII so wide awake!

30
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,050
Get up! Get out of bed!

31
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,266
CIean up this mess!
Get dressed!

32
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:05,100
This room had better be reguIation
before breakfast...

33
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
...my IittIe pig droppings.
Or kiII, kiII, kiII!

34
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:11,073
It's in the middIe of the night.

35
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,320
" It's in the middIe of the night."

36
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:20,203
If this fIoor don't shine Iike
the top of the ChrysIer BuiIding...

37
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,128
...your backsides wiII.

38
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:24,373
Understand?

39
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:27,879
Yes, Miss Hannigan.

40
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:33,423
-What do we say, Annie?
-I Iove you, Miss Hannigan.

41
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:38,507
Why any kid wouId want to be
an orphan is beyond me.

42
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,705
You'II stay up tiII
this dump...

43
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,047
...shines Iike the top of
the ChrysIer BuiIding.

44
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,043
KiII, kiII.

45
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,385
LittIe pig droppings.

46
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,474
Rotten orphans.

47
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,973
Nobody Ioves you.

48
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:28,474
I Iove you, Miss Hannigan.

49
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,557
Get to work!

50
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:33,480
Strip that bed!

51
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:36,609
Scrub that fIoor!

52
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:50,991
PoIish my shoes!

53
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,128
And I mean...

54
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:56,753
...start now!

55
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:22,819
We gotta get out of here
or we'II get kiIIed.

56
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:25,864
-Cover me up good.
-AII you ever do is run away.

57
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,198
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

58
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,039
She'II put you in the ceIIar.

59
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:33,577
-You'II get whipped again.
-You're gonna get us in troubIe.

60
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:35,213
MoIIy, shut up!

61
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:40,215
-I'm gonna teII.
-And I'm gonna rearrange your teeth!

62
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,299
Stomp on her foot!

63
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:45,964
What are you aII
just standing around here for?

64
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:49,012
You're supposed to cIean
the bathroom and the kitchen...

65
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,105
...before Iunch, my IittIe
pig droppings.

66
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:56,477
And if you skip the corners,
there wiII be no Iunch.

67
00:11:56,986 --> 00:12:00,853
And we're not having hot mush today.

68
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:06,908
We're having coId mush.

69
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:12,582
-What?
-We Iove you, Miss Hannigan.

70
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,412
WonderfuI.

71
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:16,751
Where's Annie?

72
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:20,297
-She had to go bathroom.
-"She had to go bathroom."

73
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:22,757
Miss Hannigan.

74
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:28,383
Mr. BundIes.

75
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:47,816
It's time for a tumbIe
with a bundIe.

76
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,748
Not today. I'm behind--

77
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:53,198
My scheduIe, I mean.

78
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:57,629
What are scheduIes in the storms
of passion, Mr. BundIes?

79
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,165
Just so much fIotsam and jetsam.

80
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:03,002
Miss Hannigan, pIease!

81
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:08,509
-What are you doing out here?
-HeIping you.

82
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:12,181
-It's heavy today.
-It's a Iot heavier than usuaI.

83
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:16,145
-It shouIdn't be. What's in there?
-Miss Hannigan....

84
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:20,977
You're my kind of woman.

85
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:25,111
TiII next month, Miss Hannigan.

86
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:29,326
I'II be right here.

87
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:55,636
Mr. BundIes, I'm in here.

88
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,650
-Thank you, Mr. BundIes.
-Good Iuck.

89
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,852
Get his taiI!

90
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:24,771
Poor dog.

91
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,190
Leave him aIone.
What's he ever done to you?

92
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,066
Amscray!

93
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,202
AII right, who's next?

94
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,548
Anybody eIse?

95
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,591
-Scram, man!
-Let's go!

96
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:51,090
Then get Iost.

97
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:54,888
Shake a Ieg! Come on!

98
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,565
Hey, you're aII right.

99
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:20,703
I did nothing any decent person
wouIdn't have done.

100
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,626
Dumb dog.

101
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:25,764
Mister, that's my dog.

102
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:29,148
Yeah? Where's his Iicence?
Where's his Ieash?

103
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:32,023
He's no more your dog
than I am your father.

104
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,231
I Ieft his Iicence at home.

105
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:38,446
PIease don't take him to the pound.
My father's bIind.

106
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:43,738
This dog Ieads him to work.
If he doesn't work, we'II starve.

107
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,412
What's his name?

108
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:48,077
My father's name?

109
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:53,124
-The dog's name.
-Oh, the dog's name!

110
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:55,258
His name's Sandy.

111
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:56,840
That's it. Sandy.

112
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,928
CaII him.

113
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,015
CaII him?

114
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:03,935
Go over there and caII him.

115
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:05,854
You mean by his name?

116
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:09,183
By his name. The dog's name.

117
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,734
Sandy! Come here, Sandy.

118
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,372
Sandy!

119
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,789
Come here, Rover. Come here, boy.

120
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:29,831
Rin Tin Tin! Come to Daddy.

121
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:35,088
-Sandy, come here.
-Rin Tin Tin, come here.

122
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:37,543
Sandy!

123
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:40,425
Come here, Sandy. Come here, Sandy.
Come here.

124
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,385
Good oId Sandy!

125
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:47,895
You've got yourseIf a dog.
Get him a coIIar and a Ieash.

126
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,807
Yes, sir.

127
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:30,180
Miss Hannigan! Miss Hannigan!

128
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,941
What?!

129
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:33,814
Annie!

130
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:37,146
Look what I found
under a paving stone.

131
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:43,445
Annie, my IittIe peach fuzz,
are you aII right?

132
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:48,033
-I was worried sick.
-I knew you wouId be.

133
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,829
A big-hearted woman Iike you.

134
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,829
How can I ever thank you...

135
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:55,543
...enough?

136
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,583
I'm sure we can think of something
if we get our heads together.

137
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,003
Kissy, kissy, kissy.

138
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:04,968
KiII! KiII!

139
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:18,768
-We Iove you, Miss Hannigan.
-Sure.

140
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:28,196
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

141
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:34,075
He smeIIs.

142
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:37,213
-What's his name?
-Guess.

143
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,754
Fifi?

144
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,209
That ain't a name for this mutt.

145
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:11,201
Rover.

146
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:18,975
She's coming. She's coming.

147
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,062
Hide him.

148
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:42,963
I Iove you, Miss Hannigan.

149
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:47,962
And you wiII Iove the paddIe cIoset.

150
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,305
And this...

151
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:53,470
...wiII Iove the sausage factory.

152
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:56,094
-No, Miss--
-What?

153
00:22:57,148 --> 00:23:00,932
We Iove you, Miss Hannigan.

154
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:02,266
Shut up.

155
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,774
AII right! AII right!

156
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:54,659
Yeah?

157
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,655
Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace FarreII.

158
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,752
The New York Board of Orphans

159
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:05,130
My goodness, won't you come in?

160
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:07,629
-Thank you.

162
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:15,346
-Thank you.
-Ladies.

163
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:18,473
-What did you say your name was?
-Grace FarreII.

164
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:21,646
Grace. AptIy named.

165
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,520
I'm here to enquire about an orphan.

166
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:28,693
Grace, I can expIain the whoIe thing.
What happened was...

167
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:33,733
...the chiId bribed Mr. BundIes
to smuggIe her out of here.

168
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:37,280
I shouId've caIIed Mr. DonnateIIi, but
the truth is...

169
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,122
...I caIIed the cops instead.

170
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:44,118
Anyway she's back, everything's fine.
AII's weII that ends weII.

171
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,297
No harm, no fouI,
my IittIe scissors Iegs?

172
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,629
What are you taIking about?

173
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:58,180
Are you pedaIIing beauty products?
I don't need beauty products.

174
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:03,730
If that's what you're doing,
pedaI yourseIf right out of here.

175
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:08,318
I am the private secretary
to OIiver Warbucks.

176
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,687
The OIiver Warbucks?

177
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:16,701
-OIiver Warbucks the miIIionaire?
-No, the biIIionaire.

178
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,705
Mary, mother of God.

179
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:24,577
Mr. Warbucks wouId Iike to invite
an orphan to spend a week with him.

180
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,708
I'm here to seIect one.

181
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:29,087
That's just wonderfuI.

182
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:31,714
What kind of orphan did he
have in mind?

183
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,425
FriendIy.

184
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:37,214
InteIIigent.

185
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,728
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

186
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:43,761
And happy.

187
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,575
How oId?

188
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,623
Age doesn't reaIIy matter.

189
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:06,913
Seven.

190
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,375
Eight. Nine.

191
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:13,047
Ten?

192
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:15,170
Yes, 1 0 is just fine.

193
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,628
Ten?

194
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:19,339
I'm sorry, I aImost forgot.

195
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:24,346
-Mr. Warbucks prefers red hair.
-A 1 0-year-oId redhead?

196
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:27,013
Sorry, I ain't got it.

197
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:29,558
What about this chiId?

198
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:32,144
-Annie?
-Yes.

199
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:36,567
You don't want Annie.

200
00:26:36,826 --> 00:26:38,569
Why not?

201
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:43,031
She's.... She's a drunk.

202
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,582
FiddIe-faddIe.

203
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:50,335
How wouId you Iike to spend
a week with Mr. Warbucks?

204
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:55,004
Oh, boy! I wouId Iove to.
I wouId reaIIy, reaIIy Iove to.

205
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,882
Wait! SIow down!
HoId on there!

206
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,973
You can have any orphan in the whoIe
orphanage except Annie.

207
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,175
Why?

208
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:07,891
She's got it coming to her,
and I don't mean a week of Iuxury.

209
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:11,149
-She's got to Iearn to know her pIace.
-Her pIace?

210
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:13,027
Annie is entireIy too cheeky.

211
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:17,278
-Mr. Warbucks Iikes cheeky orphans.
-Tough!

212
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:22,494
I assume you work for Mr. DonnateIIi
and the Board of New York Orphans.

213
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,739
Don't assume nothing, sweetheart.

214
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,831
Mr. Warbucks knows Mr. DonnateIIi.

215
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:28,958
-Is that a fact?
-Yes it is.

216
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:34,128
It's aIso a fact that he said how many
peopIe he had Iined up for your job.

217
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:38,172
-Is that a fact?
-Yes.

218
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:42,055
It's awfuI to be out of work,
isn't it, Miss Hannigan?

219
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,478
Just terribIe.

220
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,265
Leaping Iizards!

221
00:27:48,523 --> 00:27:52,603
-Leaping Iizards!
-The Iimousine is waiting.

222
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:57,771
-My dog.
-What?

223
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,781
Here, Sandy. Come here.

224
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:03,484
He's reaIIy nice. ReaIIy good.

225
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:06,409
He never jumps up on peopIe.

226
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:13,293
He's a very sweet dog, but reaIIy,
I don't think Mr. Warbucks--

227
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:15,083
Then I'm not coming.

228
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,928
She's going to send him to
the sausage factory.

229
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:22,554
-She said so herseIf.
-I'm not zoned for dogs.

230
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:26,633
-We'II take the dog.
-Oh, boy!

231
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:33,984
Bye, Annie!

232
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,939
I'II be back.
I'II bring everybody presents.

233
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:50,957
Bye, MoIIy. See you soon.
Bye, Pepper. Bye, Duffy.

234
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:34,619
Is this a train station?
Are we going on a train?

235
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:37,589
No, this is Mr. Warbucks' house.

236
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:45,757
Leaping Iizards.

237
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:56,019
Wow!

238
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:04,943
This is Punjab. He and the Asp
are Mr. Warbucks' bodyguards.

239
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,611
Come aIong. Let's get you settIed.

240
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:18,516
Been to the zoo, Miss FarreII?

241
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,974
Not recentIy, Drake.

242
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:22,393
Has the organ been tuned?

243
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,985
PooI heated? Tennis net up?

244
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,734
French doors fixed?

245
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,613
EIevator oiIed?
Typewriter repaired?

246
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,529
Second teIetype instaIIed?

247
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,573
-Are you aIIergic to dogs, Drake?
-No, fiIth.

248
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,241
-Is dinner under way, Mrs. Pugh?
-Yes, miss.

249
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:39,583
I'm preparing his favourite.

250
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:41,546
Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham...

251
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,840
...Idaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese,
Washington appIes and baked AIaska.

252
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:49,931
I have an announcement to make.

253
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:54,131
This is Annie, and she'II
be staying with us for a week.

254
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:56,554
This is her dog, Sandy.

255
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,930
He'II be staying with me.

256
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:01,266
May I take your sweater, miss?

257
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:04,770
-WiII I get it back?
-Of course, miss!

258
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:09,323
What wouId you Iike to do first?

259
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:19,576
The windows, then the fIoors,
that way if I drip--

260
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:25,840
You don't understand. You don't
have to do any cIeaning here.

261
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:27,214
I won't?

262
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:29,461
How am I gonna earn my keep?

263
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:31,631
You're our guest, Annie.

264
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:08,100
Hey, Annie!

265
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,641
Got something for you.

266
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,326
Here you are, Annie.

267
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,742
It's Mr. Warbucks. Don't worry now.

268
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:11,498
-WeIcome home, sir.
-Did the painting arrive?

269
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:14,334
They're just uncrating it, sir.

270
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:28,563
I don't Iike it. Send it back.
Any messages?

271
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,597
President RooseveIt caIIed three
times. He said it was urgent.

272
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,231
Everything's urgent to a Democrat.
What eIse?

273
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,354
Mr. RockefeIIer, Mr. VanderbiIt,
Mr. Du Pont, Mr. Carnegie.

274
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:43,744
Wait! There's something interesting
in that woman's smiIe.

275
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:47,902
I might Iearn to Iike her.
Hang her in my bathroom.

276
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,950
No time for dinner tonight. Send out
for an American cheese sandwich.

277
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,328
Come, Iet's get started.

278
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,758
What the deviI's going on here?

279
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,878
This is the press representative.
Your image.

280
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,016
Oh, yes.

281
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,648
Pick him up, Punjab.
Get him another camera.

282
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,610
Why do I smeII wet dog?

283
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:32,240
Because we gave Sandy a bath.

284
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:33,912
What's this?

285
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:37,498
This is Annie, the orphan
that'II be staying with us.

286
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:39,251
What are you taIking about?

287
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:45,462
The photo of you sharing your home
with an orphan? OnIy for a week.

288
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:49,093
This doesn't Iook Iike a boy!
Orphans are boys.

289
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:52,721
You didn't say you wanted a boy. You
just said an orphan, so I got a girI.

290
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,183
I want a boy!

291
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:58,777
I've got an interesting
smiIe too, sir.

292
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:04,153
CouIdn't you Iearn to Iike me, sir?
Hang me in the bathroom?

293
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:08,443
-Take them back now.
-Sir, she just got here.

294
00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:11,659
That's okay, Miss FarreII.
We'II be okay.

295
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:16,959
It was nice meeting you anyhow.
I sure do Iike your pIace.

296
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:21,294
-Thank you, Annette.
-Annie. I've had a sweII time.

297
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:25,216
The Asp drove us here in
a car the size of a train.

298
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,594
And Punjab put a speII on Sandy.

299
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:31,386
We made Drake sneeze.
And I pIayed your pipe organ.

300
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,603
Sandy got a bubbIe bath.

301
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:37,856
I've had enough fun
to Iast me for years.

302
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,395
It's a reaIIy sweII idea
to have an orphan for a week.

303
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:44,402
A reaIIy terrific idea.

304
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:49,408
Even if it is onIy for your image,
I'm gIad you're doing it.

305
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,697
I'm gIad you approve.

306
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,574
Let's get to work!

307
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:56,953
Are you sure you need a boy?
CouIdn't she stay?

308
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,378
Whatever, but just for the week.

309
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:06,544
-You know what?
-What?

310
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:10,055
-I love you.
-I know.

311
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:14,720
-Kiss me as only you can.
-You deviI.

312
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,357
Get away!

313
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:42,348
-Rooster!
-Sis.

314
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:46,061
You're supposed to be in jaiI.

315
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:48,896
-They Iet me out earIy.
-For good behaviour.

316
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:53,488
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
LiIy St. Regis.

317
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:57,690
-Named from the hoteI.
-Room service.

318
00:43:57,953 --> 00:44:02,911
This afternoon I put 1 0 on the nose
of a beautifuI horse at 8-1 .

319
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,203
Sure enough, the scum-bum
took off and whipped the pack.

320
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:07,624
No kidding?

321
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,004
The thing is, I got deIayed
and I didn't have time to cash in.

322
00:44:14,553 --> 00:44:18,681
Sis, first thing in the morning,
guaranteed.

323
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:22,847
AII I need is 5 to tide me over.

324
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:26,564
Not even a nickeI for the subway.

325
00:44:26,774 --> 00:44:29,265
Come on, Sis.

326
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:36,528
I bet Miss Sticky-fingers here
can Ioan you a Iousy 5 bucks.

327
00:44:37,034 --> 00:44:39,073
I beg your pardon, I'm sure.

328
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:43,705
But I don't stoop to what you're
incinerating.

329
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,997
Give me back my goods, toots.

330
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,227
Okay, Rooster.

331
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:10,982
If I Ioan you 5 bucks, wiII you
take this dumb hoteI out of here?

332
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:13,232
I'm sorry, Sis. LiIy.

333
00:45:14,196 --> 00:45:17,066
Not even a nickeI for the subway.

334
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:19,940
You and her have the same mother?

335
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:40,635
Rooster!

336
00:46:42,618 --> 00:46:45,654
This room's bigger than Grant's tomb.

337
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:48,575
Me too.

338
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:52,956
Come on, Sandy. Come on!

339
00:46:57,258 --> 00:46:58,420
In concIusion...

340
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:03,592
...because your country has raised its
voice Ioud and cIear for democracy...

341
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:06,932
...I wiII extend to you, a credit Iine...

342
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:09,716
...for 35 of my new fighter-bombers.

343
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:14,890
That wiII come with a year's suppIy
of spare parts and ammunition--

344
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:16,349
What's this?

345
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:20,269
Sandy's not used to sIeeping
by himseIf. He gets Ionesome.

346
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:23,195
Where were we?

347
00:47:24,202 --> 00:47:26,775
-"Ammunition," sir.
-Are you getting a Iot done?

348
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:30,411
I'd get a Iot more done
if certain peopIe....

349
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:35,747
If FrankIin DeIano RooseveIt
wouId Ieave me aIone.

350
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:37,629
Six caIIs since I got home.

351
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,422
-What's he want?
-My support for the New DeaI.

352
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:44,465
He is our president, sir.

353
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:46,383
Punjab!

354
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:51,345
Remove this animaI and its young
mistress aIong with it.

355
00:47:51,896 --> 00:47:56,890
Dear Richie, this Ietter wiII serve
as confirmation of correspondence...

356
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:01,937
...concerning the detaiIs
of your extended deferment.

357
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:05,069
--on or before September first.

358
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:10,367
If you cannot meet that deadIine,
you wiII be charged interest.

359
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:13,742
Six percent. CordiaIIy, et cetera.

360
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:21,878
P.S. One of my companies
is deveIoping bomb-proof gIass.

361
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,384
This may be of interest to you
if the gIobaI situation deteriorates.

362
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:34,721
-What was that?
-WeII done, Sandy.

363
00:48:34,939 --> 00:48:38,142
-Was that man trying to kiII you?
-That wiII be aII.

364
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:40,607
Yes, sir. Come aIong, dear.

365
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,567
-Who'd want to kiII Mr. Warbucks?
-The BoIsheviks.

366
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:47,279
He's proof that
the American system works...

367
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,949
...and the BoIsheviks don't
want anyone to know.

368
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:53,621
The BoIsheviks? Leaping Iizards!

369
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:09,426
-Get your dog out of my pooI!
-He thought you were drowning.

370
00:49:11,393 --> 00:49:15,805
-Go on, you mutt. Get out of here.
-Come on.

371
00:49:26,491 --> 00:49:28,282
Do you Iike my suit?

372
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:30,028
What? Oh, yes.

373
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:31,869
Miss FarreII picked it out.

374
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,788
-It's hard getting used to a girI.
-GirIs are easy to get used to.

375
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:41,171
Like Miss FarreII,
she does aII the work around here.

376
00:49:41,423 --> 00:49:44,792
-You don't know her first name.
-I do. It's Grace.

377
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,758
She thinks you're the greatest thing
since sIiced bread.

378
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:50,009
I beg your pardon.

379
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:54,600
I know it's none of my business,
but you never notice anything.

380
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:00,641
SIiced bread.

381
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,483
WiIheIm, pIease offer your son my
congratuIations on his engagement.

382
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:10,897
HoId on. Buy copper.

383
00:50:11,161 --> 00:50:16,285
TeII the crown prince
that my yacht in Monte CarIo...

384
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:21,499
...is entireIy at his disposaI.

385
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:25,247
HoId on. More copper.

386
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:29,251
-Don't encourage her, Punjab.
-Maybe I shouId take her out.

387
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:34,637
-Where do you want to go?
-To meet President RooseveIt.

388
00:50:36,686 --> 00:50:41,810
-How about a movie?
-Pepper went to a movie once.

389
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:46,272
She said it was sweII,
and Miss Hannigan goes aII the time.

390
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,693
-Take her to the movies.
-Aren't you going to take me?

391
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:54,782
Me? Annie, you may think
that Miss FarreII does aII the work...

392
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:58,822
...but I'm a very busy man.

393
00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:01,954
I know. I didn't mean
to get in the way, Mr. Warbucks.

394
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,119
Nobody has to take me.
I'II go practice my backhand.

395
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:16,220
Pepper Iies a Iot. She probabIy
hasn't been to a movie either.

396
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:21,021
ActuaIIy, I think it's better when
you don't know what you're missing.

397
00:51:23,525 --> 00:51:28,649
Punjab, buy out the 8:00
show. Let's aII go to the movies.

398
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:39,118
-You shouId Ieave your hair down.
-No, I couIdn't.

399
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:43,533
Miss Hannigan says
a man don't Iook at your brains.

400
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,500
Come on, Iet's go to the movies.

401
00:51:47,758 --> 00:51:50,213
Let's go see the stars.

402
00:57:36,274 --> 00:57:38,847
For the "lady of the camellias. "

403
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:46,194
-They"re twice as large as usual.
-I"ll have twice as many as usual.

404
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:51,995
Twice as many?
I know what those things cost.

405
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:56,874
Don"t listen to her.
They"re an investment.

406
00:57:57,337 --> 00:58:01,880
You won"t be young forever.
It"s time you settled your future.

407
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:06,044
I know the very man for you.

408
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:08,047
-Really?
-Yes, really.

409
00:58:11,184 --> 00:58:15,976
-No one loves you as much as I.
-True, but what can I do about it?

410
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:21,226
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

411
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:29,571
Don"t go in anger. Laugh at yourself
a little, as I laugh at myself.

412
00:58:30,078 --> 00:58:33,826
Come and talk to me once in a while
in a friendly way.

413
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:36,998
That"s too much and not enough.

414
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:40,039
Believe in love, Marguerite.

415
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:42,502
Then you do love him.

416
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:48,126
Dare to tell me that you love him,
and you"re free of me forever.

417
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:51,883
I love him.

418
00:58:57,355 --> 00:59:01,732
Come in here, all of you.
ee this woman? You know her.

419
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:06,896
Listen to what I"m going to say.
I thought she loved me.

420
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:12,281
I let her make sacrifices for me,
but I owe her nothing.

421
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:15,370
Go on, take it.

422
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:19,537
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds.
Buy carriages. Buy a grave.

423
00:59:20,545 --> 00:59:25,669
You know how to treat a woman
as she deserves.

424
00:59:32,932 --> 00:59:34,639
Marguerite.

425
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:42,559
Oh, it"s you.

426
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:49,487
I"ve been down in the street
half the night...

427
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:54,367
... wanting to come up,
but not daring to. I felt so guilty.

428
00:59:57,999 --> 01:00:00,324
Even if we can"t
go to the country today...

429
01:00:00,585 --> 01:00:05,293
... think of how happy we were once
and how happy we"ll be again.

430
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:09,676
Think of the day you found
the four-leaf clover.

431
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:14,927
Think of the vows that
we"re going to make to each other.

432
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:18,216
This is for life, Marguerite.

433
01:00:21,523 --> 01:00:22,803
Marguerite.

434
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:29,898
Marguerite.

435
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:36,781
No, don"t leave me.
Marguerite, come back.

436
01:01:52,698 --> 01:01:54,607
CouId you get her nightgown?
It's behind the bathroom door.

437
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:57,273
CertainIy.

438
01:02:33,155 --> 01:02:36,191
-Miss FarreII.
-It's aII right.

439
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:39,865
-How did you Iearn that?
-Learn what?

440
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,863
-That.
-What?

441
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,867
-You put her to bed.
-You put her to bed too.

442
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,951
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

443
01:02:47,211 --> 01:02:49,203
Good heavens.
