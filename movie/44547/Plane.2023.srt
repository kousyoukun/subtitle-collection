1
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,677
-会很艰难的——是的。
- This is gonna be rough. - Yep.

2
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,788
-嗨，爸爸。-嗨，丹妮拉。
- Hi, Dad. - Hey, Daniela.

3
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:35,704
我要赶去安检。一切都好吗?
I'm rushing to security. Is everything okay?

4
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:37,532
是的，我们很好。只是打个招呼。
Yeah, we're fine. Just checking in.

5
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,099
——对不起。-你能做到吗?
- Sorry. - Are you gonna make it?

6
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,275
我觉得医疗检查应该尽快进行。
Yeah, I think med-checks should go quickly.

7
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,799
我是说在午夜前赶到这里。
I meant make it here before midnight.

8
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,105
你还在新加坡。
You're still in Singapore.

9
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,977
夏威夷晚了18个小时。
Well, Hawaii is 18 hours behind.

10
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,023
到东京只要六个多小时。还有六分钟到檀香山。
It's just over six hours to Tokyo. Another six to Honolulu.

11
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,504
所以，我会有充足的时间去那里。
So, I'll be there with plenty of time to spare.

12
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:58,118
除夕夜。一个延迟…嘿,嘿。不会有任何延误。
New Year's Eve. One delay... Hey, hey. There won't be any delays.

13
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,076
等一等。
Hold on.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,947
嘿,抱歉。今天早上我要迟到了。
Hey, sorry. I'm running late this morning.

15
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,317
我只需要扫描你的警徽，很快就能让你通过。
I just need to scan your badge, and we'll get you through quickly.

16
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,213
谢谢你！
Thank you.

17
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:10,608
现在，告诉你凯莉阿姨我在等一些自制的羊肚羊肚，小羊肚和小羊肚，好吗?
Now, tell your Aunt Carrie I'm expecting some homemade haggis, neeps, and tatties waiting for me, all right?

18
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,610
——好的。-待会儿见。
- Okay. - I'll see you soon.

19
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:15,222
嗨,爸爸。
Hey, Dad.

20
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,137
我真的很高兴我们能这样做。
I'm really glad that we're doing this.

21
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,183
我很抱歉过了这么久我们才在一起。
And I'm sorry that it's taken so long for us to be together.

22
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:23,099
不要道歉。我知道你在学校的生活很忙。
Don't apologize. I know you have a busy life at school.

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,666
是啊，多亏了你。
Yeah, thanks to you.

24
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,190
那是我的工作，亲爱的。
That's my job, sweetheart.

25
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,887
我不会有其他选择。
I wouldn't have it any other way.

26
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,239
嗯,差不多。
Well, almost.

27
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:45,077
-托伦斯上尉?-是的，抱歉我迟到了。
- Captain Torrance? - Yeah, sorry I'm late.

28
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,515
没事，长官，飞行官还没来呢。
It's fine, sir. The flight officer hasn't even come by yet.

29
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,866
——好。——哦。撒母耳削除。
- Good. - Oh. Samuel Dele.

30
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,260
-很高兴认识你。-哦，很高兴见到你。
- Nice to meet you. - Oh, nice to meet you.

31
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:56,263
-新年快乐。-也敬你。
- Happy New Year. - And to you.

32
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,700
-你来自哪里?-呃，香港，先生。
- Where are you from? - Uh, Hong Kong, sir.

33
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,789
在民航处接受培训。
Did my training at the Civil Aviation Department.

34
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,400
哦,是的。我听说那是一所很棒的学院。
Oh, yeah. I hear that's a great academy.

35
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:07,709
你呢，先生?我猜是英语?
And you, sir? English, I'm guessing?

36
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,886
地狱,没有。我不会降低自己的身份。
Hell, no. I wouldn't lower myself.

37
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,237
——不。我是苏格兰人。——哦。
- Nope. I'm Scottish. - Oh.

38
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:18,676
虽然我几年前开过英国皇家空军运输机。
Although I did fly RAF Transport years ago.

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,463
那时候，所有性感的任务都交给英国人。
Back then, all the sexy assignments went to the English blokes.

40
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:27,119
不过，我并不介意，因为对我来说，重型飞机是进入航空公司的捷径。
I didn't mind, though, because for me, the heavies were an easy path into the airlines.

41
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:32,255
看来他们要把我们推过天气了。
Well, it looks like they're pushing us through weather.

42
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,300
当然了。
Of course they are.

43
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,826
先生们，让我看看。
Gentlemen, let's see.

44
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,045
一百一十九，十四名乘客。
One-hundred and nineteen, fourteen passengers.

45
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,960
一切都清除。有问题吗?
Everything cleared. Any questions?

46
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,615
是的。看来我们要挺过恶劣天气了。
Yeah. Looks like we're pushing through some serious weather.

47
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,530
它在中国南海聚集。
It's converging here over the South China Sea.

48
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:51,056
我们意识到了这一点。你到那里的时候，它应该已经向内陆移动了。-如果放在那里炖呢?
We're aware of it. By the time you get there, - it should have moved inland. - What if it sits there and stews?

49
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,494
我们可以向东推进，北上吕宋岛?
We can push out east, come north over Luzon?

50
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,193
这就增加了一个小时和18K的燃料。
That adds an hour and 18K in fuel.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,282
这趟航班快空了，所以我们得缩短时间。
The flight's nearly empty, so we need to shorten.

52
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,153
到37。你会放晴的。
Take it to 37. You'll clear that weather.

53
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,503
良好的飞行。新年快乐。
Good flight. Happy New Year.

54
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,418
新年快乐。
Happy New Year.

55
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,204
我们的ipad能像他的那样控制天气吗?
Do our iPads control the weather like his does?

56
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:11,381
好了。
There you go.

57
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,297
你好,先生们。
Hello, gentlemen.

58
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:15,970
我叫邦妮。今晚我是你们的主任。
My name's Bonnie. I'll be your chief tonight.

59
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:17,929
——哦。很高兴见到你，邦妮-很高兴见到你。
- Oh. Nice to meet you, Bonnie. - Good to meet you.

60
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,911
上尉，你要去机场。
Um, Captain, you're needed in the Jetway.

61
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,133
——好的。-再见，上尉
- Okay. - See you soon, Cap.

62
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,968
托伦斯机长，我是飞行指挥官。我能帮你什么忙吗?
Captain Torrance, Flight Commander. How can I help you?

63
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,926
引渡到多伦多。
Fugitive extradition to Toronto.

64
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,711
我们会一直陪你到东京。
We'll be with you as far as Tokyo.

65
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:39,314
他会一直受到我的监管。
He'll remain in constraints and be under my constant supervision.

66
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,586
他危险吗?他做了什么?
Well, is he dangerous? What did he do?

67
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,892
凶杀案，15年前。
Homicide. 15 years ago.

68
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,896
没想到会这样。
Wasn't expecting that.

69
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,985
我们在巴厘岛用化名找到了他。
We found him in Bali under an alias.

70
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,900
我得说，他一直都在。
And he's been around, I'll say that.

71
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:55,251
是的，这是一次空飞行。你会吸引很多人的注意。
Yeah, this is a bare flight. You're gonna attract a lot of attention.

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,135
我不想吓到其他乘客。
I don't wanna scare the rest of the passengers.

73
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,776
恐怕你只能跟着我们了，上尉。
I'm afraid you're stuck with us, Captain.

74
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,086
好吧。
All right.

75
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,914
拜托你离其他人远点。
Just keep away from everyone else, please.

76
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:06,958
收到
Copy that.

77
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,874
我们走吧。
Let's go.

78
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,738
-你检查过后面了吗?-一切都安排好了。
- Did you check the back there? - Everything is set back there.

79
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:28,937
晚上,女士们。
Evening, ladies.

80
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,175
-晚上好，上尉。- - -晚上。你好吗?

81
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,307

83
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,377
——玛丽亚。快乐。-嗨，玛丽亚。是的。
- Maria. Pleasure. - Hi, Maria. Yeah.

84
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,205
布罗迪托兰斯。
Brodie Torrance.

85
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,661
我们都准备好离开新加坡了吗?
We're all ready to get out of Singapore?

86
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,948
-好的，先生-好的我们走吧。
- Yes, sir. - Okay. Let's go.

87
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,689
好的。
Okay.

88
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,908
好的，确认有14名乘客。
Okay, confirming 14 passengers.

89
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,433
14名乘客。新年的灯。
Fourteen passengers. New Year's light.

90
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,697
大家都看到我们后面的特别嘉宾了吧?
I'm sure everybody's seen our special guest at the back?

91
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,699
——路易斯·加斯帕，35B。——嗯。
- Louis Gaspare, 35B. - Mmm-hmm.

92
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:52,743
他做了什么?
What did he do?

93
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,790
我相信我们知道得越少越好。
I'm sure the less we know, the better.

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,228
你知道的，尽量少跟他交流。这是所有。
You know, just keep your interactions with him to a minimum. That's all.

95
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,230
-好吗?很好。——是的。
- All right? Good. - Yep.

96
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,729
我们要开始新的一年了吗?

97
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,189
-好的，长官-好的

-他们见过他的脸-新年快乐。
- They've seen his face. - Happy New Year.

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,841
他们……他们已经看到了。我…-加里，我不能逼他们签字。-嗨，新年快乐。
They've... They've seen it. I... - Gary, I can't make them sign. - Hi, happy New Year.

110
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,214
-嗨。-新年快乐。

- D-F, just right here. - Hello.

114
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,356
你在开玩笑吧?你是怎么升级的?
You gotta be kidding me? How'd you get an upgrade?

115
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,095
Trailmiles。
Trailmiles.

116
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,314
我要一个人坐经济舱。
I've gotta sit on my own, in coach.

117
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:43,596
-新年快乐。-新年快乐。
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

118
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,885
他们会在你买机票的时候告诉你飞机的机龄。-不是开玩笑。
They should tell you when you buy your ticket - how old the plane will be. - No kidding.

119
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,409
不用担心，伙计们。
Oh, no need to worry, folks.

120
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,541
这些飞机几乎坚不可摧。

121
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,760
嘿,女孩。新年快乐。

126
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,468
不好意思，女士们。够远了。

127
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,774
但这些是我们的座位。

我住34D。

那是一条路。时间吗?

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,504
零时十秒。你是…这是一条该死的路。

19分23秒后，所有通讯都停止了。
Nineteen minutes, 23 seconds later, all communication stopped.

402
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:21,683
马尼拉空中交通管制中心一直在雷达上监视他们，直到当地时间凌晨5点43分，飞机下降到2万英尺以下，失去了所有联系。
Manila ATC had them on radar until 5:43 a.m. local when the plane dipped below 20,000 feet and lost all contact.

403
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,685
马上给我接大卫·斯卡斯代尔。
Get me David Scarsdale, right now.

404
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:27,863
我们有一些割伤和擦伤，但是，我想大家都很慌乱。
Um, we have some cuts and bruises, but, um, I think everyone's just pretty rattled.

405
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,386
有人有手机信号吗?
Anyone have cell service?

406
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,431
不。没有一个人。
No. No one.

407
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,652
我们该拿犯人怎么办?
What do we do about the prisoner?

408
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,349
我不知道。这对我来说是个新问题。
I don't know. That's a new one for me.

409
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,616
嗯…我看见他在看警官的钥匙，所以我就拿走了。
Um... I saw him eyeing the officer's keys, so I took them.

410
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,226
他危险吗?
Is he dangerous?

411
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,841
他因谋杀指控被引渡。
He's being extradited on a murder charge.

412
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:53,889
官……警官说，是的，他可能很危险。
The officer... The officer said, yeah, he might be dangerous.

413
00:27:56,022 --> 00:28:02,028
听着，我们只要盯着他让他和其他乘客分开，好吗?
Look, we just keep an eye on him and keep him separate from the other passengers, okay?

414
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,203
尽你最大的努力。
Just try your best.

415
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,639
——好的。-好吧。
- Okay. - All right.

416
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,815
在这里。我觉得你应该留着这些。
Here. I think you should hold on to these.

417
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,514
——好的。我们走吧。——好的。
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

418
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:11,646
是的,好的。
Yeah, okay.

419
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,344
水……只是没有。
Water... Just nowhere.

420
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,913
-怎么回事?-告诉我们。
- What's going on? - Tell us something.

421
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,610
是的。我们需要信息。
Yeah. We need information.

422
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,482
我们能得到一些真实的答案吗?
Can we please get some real answers?

423
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:26,966
-肯定有什么…-好了，各位…每个人都…听着，听着。
- There's gotta be some thing... - Okay, everybody... Everybody... Listen, listen up.

424
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,751
我要感谢大家的合作。
I want to thank you all for your cooperation.

425
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,798
我为我们刚刚经历的一切感到抱歉，我知道你们都有疑问。
I'm sorry for what we just had to go through, and I know you all have questions.

426
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:33,973
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

427
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:35,191
情况是这样的。
So, here's the situation.

428
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:41,763
我们被闪电击中了，主电源和通讯都坏了。
We got hit by lightning and our main power and comms are down.

429
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:45,549
好吧，到目前为止，还没办法求救。
Okay, so, as of now, there's no way of calling for help.

430
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:48,378
什么?你在开玩笑吧。没有办法吗?没有办法吗?
What? You're kidding. No way? No way?

431
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:53,732
我现在需要大家做的是，听好了…-为什么?-保持冷静。
What I need everybody to do right now, listen up... - How come? - Is remain calm.

432
00:28:53,775 --> 00:29:01,672
好吧?等飞机冷却下来，我们就回去，拿上东西，喝点水然后想想接下来要做什么。
All right? Once the plane cools down, we're gonna get back on there, we're gonna get our things, get some water and we're gonna figure out what we're gonna do.

433
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,132
你知道我们在哪里吗?
Do you know where we are?

434
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:07,397
是的，我们认为我们在菲律宾南部的达沃附近。
Yeah, we think that we're near Davao in the southern Philippines.

435
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,052
-你觉得呢?-我们认为。
- You think? - We think.

436
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:17,756
-非常让人放心。-请放心，我和机组人员会尽一切努力确保你安全离开这里。
- Very reassuring. - Rest assured, me and the crew are gonna do everything we can to make sure that we get you out of here safely.

437
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,280
好吧?好的。谢谢你！
All right? Okay. Thank you.

438
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,977
好吧，来吧。
Okay, come on.

439
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,676
-嘿，特里。-嗨。
- Hey, Terry. - Hey.

440
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,461
各位，这是大卫·斯卡斯代尔。
Everyone, this is David Scarsdale.

441
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:30,725
他专门研究企业战略和危机管理。
He specializes in corporate strategy and crisis management.

442
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,119
-新年快乐。-希望如此。
- Happy New Year. - Let's hope so.

443
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:34,685
这是最后的联络点吗?
Is this the last point of contact?

444
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:35,774
是的，它是。
Yes, it is.

445
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,166
那是一场该死的风暴。
That's a hell of a storm.

446
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,864
哪个白痴让他们飞过去的?
What idiot sent them flying through that?

447
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,691
这是航空公司的规定。
It's airline protocol.

448
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,824
飞行很轻松。这是最有效的路线。
Flight was light. It was the most efficient route.

449
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,565
我以为他们能从上面飞过。
I thought they could fly above it.

450
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:47,437
你认为呢?怎么，你他妈也是气象学家吗?
You thought? What, are you a fucking meteorologist, too?

451
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:48,743
你节省了多少燃料?
How much fuel did you save?

452
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,484
约12000美元。
About $12,000.

453
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,356
好,祝贺你。这还不算这笔生意的小费。
Well, congratulations. That's barely tip money on this deal.

454
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,881
时间不等人。每一分钟都很重要。
The clock is ticking. Every minute matters.

455
00:29:55,924 --> 00:30:01,625
如果那架飞机在海上迫降，或者迫降，我们可以把那几分钟算作生命的逝去或获救。明白了吗?
If that plane ditched at sea, or crash landed, we can count those minutes in lives lost or saved. Got it?

456
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,715
好吧，那我该怎么办?打电话给军队?美国资产?
Okay, so, what can I do? Call the military? US assets?

457
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,934
你最好的选择是什么?
What are your best options?

458
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:09,895
在那个地方，现在只有一个选择。
Well, in that part of the world, there's only one option right now.

459
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,070
那是什么?
What's that?

460
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,308
你会想让律师离开这里的。
You're gonna want the lawyers out of here.

461
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:13,812
它很好。告诉我。
It's fine. Tell me.

462
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,250
私人资产。我已经很喜欢了。
Private assets. I'm already into it.

463
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:21,907
——雇佣军?-特里…菲律宾不是阿马尔菲海岸。
- Mercenaries? - Terry... The Philippines are not the Amalfi Coast.

464
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,955
现在，我需要一个小组为各种可能的情况准备新闻稿。
Now, I need a group working on press releases for every possible scenario.

465
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,305
像马航370一样消失了。
A ghosting like Malaysia 370.

466
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,873
迫降，无人生还。
A crash landing with no survivors.

467
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,701
有要求的劫机。
A hijacking with demands.

468
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,486
如果你除夕有安排，我刚取消了。
If you have plans for New Year's Eve, I just canceled them.

469
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,880
再远一点。是的，一直到最后。
A little further. Yeah, right to the end.

470
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,274
-尽量紧。-是的。
- Tight as we can. - Yeah.

471
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,363
为什么我们就不能待在飞机里?
Why can't we just stay inside the plane?

472
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:46,235
既安全又干燥。
It's safe and dry.

473
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:50,936
这是个好问题，先生…辛克莱。马特·辛克莱。
Well, that's a good question, Mister, uh... Sinclair. Matt Sinclair.

474
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:55,854
如果没有空调，那架飞机会在太阳下烤熟的。
Well, without air conditioning, that plane is gonna cook in the sun.

475
00:30:57,464 --> 00:31:02,208
所以，我们最好在这里，有遮蔽处，有微风。
So, we're better off out here, with the shelter and a breeze.

476
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:08,083
马特·辛克莱，你去的时候，能过来帮忙保护一下吗?
Hey, while you're there, you wanna step in, help secure that, Matt Sinclair?

477
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:16,091
好吧，如果你们在包里，找到了任何东西比如杀虫剂，防晒霜，食物，请分享。好吧?
Okay, if you're in your bags, you find anything like, uh, bug spray, sunscreen, food, please share. All right?

478
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,966
Gaspare先生。
Mr. Gaspare.

479
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:33,674
嗯…看来我们把自己弄得有点乱了。
Well... Looks like we've got ourselves in a bit of a mess here.

480
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,944
所以，我不太确定我们该拿你怎么办。
And so, I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do with you.

481
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,338
说实话，我有点惊讶你还在这里。
To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're still here.

482
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,212
你以为我蠢到在我不知道的丛林里逃跑吗?
You think I'm fucking stupid enough to try and escape in a jungle I don't know?

483
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:52,606
在手铐吗?
In handcuffs?

484
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,913
除非你主动提出。
Unless you're offering.

485
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,004
我觉得我做不到。
I don't think I can do that.

486
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,008
那我们就没什么好谈的了。
Then we have nothing to talk about.

487
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,150
大便。
Shit.

488
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,375
这就是40安培保险丝被足够的能量撞击后的结果，足以点亮一座城市。
This is what happens when a 40-amp fuse gets hit with enough juice to light a city.

489
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:24,551
看看吧，伙计。
Check it out, man.

490
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,512
收音机呢?
What about the radio?

491
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:34,735
看这里。哦,不。
Let's see here. Oh, no.

492
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:37,303
油炸，融化。
It's fried, melted.

493
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,391
应答器呢?
And the transponder?

494
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:42,351
没有电很难分辨。
It's hard to tell without the power.

495
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:56,800
如果我们能把隔离总线重新布线到基本总线上，我们就能从电池中消耗更多安培。
If we could reroute the isolation bus to the essential bus, we could draw down more amps from the battery.

496
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:58,498
理论上是这样。
In theory.

497
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:05,940
机长，除了尸体和他们的行李，飞机上的人都没了。
Captain, plane's fully unloaded except for the, uh, bodies and their personals.

498
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,467
-我来处理。——好的。
- I'll handle it. - Okay.

499
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,340
-嗨，邦妮——是吗?
- Hey, Bonnie. - Yeah?

500
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,602
伊莎贝拉的事我很抱歉。
Sorry about Isabella.

501
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,898
-你在干什么，伙计?-你知道他们怎么说的。
- What are you doing, man? - You know what they say.

502
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,943
没有视频，没有发生。
No video, didn't happen.

503
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:25,645
我们都在这里。独自一人，在丛林里。
Here we all are. Alone, in the jungle.

504
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,735
不知道我们要怎么出去。
No idea of how we're gonna get out.

505
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:35,133
他们是史上最糟糕的一次飞行的幸存者。
Survivors of the worst fucking plane ride in the history of bad plane rides.

506
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,136
我们可爱的飞机决定从天上掉下来。
There's our lovely plane that decided to fall out of the sky.

507
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:43,097
开拓者。我再也不坐飞机了。
Trailblazer. Never flying this again.

508
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,928
这是我们的零食。他们能撑一个小时左右。
There's our snacks. They're gonna last us about an hour.

509
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,059
十六年。
Zero-sixteen.

510
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,367
坚持了13分钟。
Carried that course for 13 minutes.

511
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:57,633
假设应答器随着雷击而坠毁我们来算算。
So, assuming the transponder went down with the lightning strike... Let's do the math.

512
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,941
17分钟，时速300英里。
That's 17 minutes, 300 miles per hour.

513
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:05,641
把它乘出来，就是。大便。
So, multiplying that out, that's... Shit.

514
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:09,123
搜索半径超过一千平方英里。
That's over a thousand square miles' search radius.

515
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,256
要找到我们，除非出现奇迹。
It'll take a miracle to find us here.

516
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:14,041
队长。这个岛?霍洛岛吗?
Captain. This island here? Jolo?

517
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,175
这非常非常糟糕。
It's very, very bad.

518
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:22,484
-什么…-由分裂分子和罪犯经营。
- What... - It's run by separatists and criminals.

519
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,356
没有政府和警察。
There's no government or police.

520
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:27,141
如果这是我们降落的地方，我们不安全。
If this is where we landed, we're not safe.

521
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:31,972
好吧，我们告诉邦妮。
All right, we tell Bonnie.

522
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,194
但我们还是先保守秘密吧。
But let's keep this to ourselves for now.

523
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:41,068
还有这个人，神秘先生。
And then there's this guy, Mr. Mysterious.

524
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,201
很友好。
Very friendly.

525
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:47,161
-不不不。——船长!
- No, no, no. - Captain!

526
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,774
别让我出现在你的视频里!
Keep me out of your fucking videos!

527
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,305
嘿，你撞到头了吗?你还好吗?
Hey, did you hit your head? Are you okay?

528
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:01,804
玛丽亚，你能把医疗袋拿来吗?
Maria, can you please get the medic bag?

529
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:02,829
是的。
Yep.

530
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,231
我需要你在媒体面前拍一段镜头，特里。
I'm gonna need you to do an on-camera hit for the press, Terry.

531
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:16,146
我们会准备一份声明，但你也需要回答问题。
We'll have a statement prepared, but you'll need to take questions, too.

532
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,037
难道我们不应该再多了解一点吗?
Shouldn't we wait till we know a little bit more?

533
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,735
如果我们等到知道更多的时候，看起来你在隐瞒什么。
If we wait until we know more, it looks like you're hiding something.

534
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:21,040
只要表现出你的关心，保持谦逊。
Just show your concern, be humble.

535
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,414
-你知道规矩。-知道了。
- You know the drill. - Got it.

536
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:26,113
给你。
Here you go.

537
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,941
你，该死的天气预报员。
You, Mr. Fuckin' Weatherman.

538
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,073
是时候自我救赎了。
Time to redeem yourself.

539
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,858
我需要那架飞机上的所有资料。
I need everything on that aircraft.

540
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,555
飞行时间，维护记录。
Flight times, maintenance logs.

541
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,775
上次维修飞机的技术人员名单。
Names of the techs who last serviced the plane.

542
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,646
——一切。-好的，先生，知道了
- Everything. - Yes, sir. Got it.

543
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,263
你确定吗，上尉?
You sure about this, Captain?

544
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,020
不。
No.

545
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,761
但我们的选择不多了。
But we're running pretty low on options.

546
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,852
听着，我不会把他绑起来。
Look, I'm not tying him up.

547
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,931
如果他逃跑了，至少他远离了其他人，对吧?
If he runs, at least he's away from the others, right?

548
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:26,608
好吧。
All right.

549
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,436
我们去告诉其他人吧。
Let's go and break it to the others.

550
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,533
好了，各位。听好了。
All right, everybody. Listen up.

551
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:39,795
这是我们的情况。
So, here's our situation.

552
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:47,803
德勒先生和我，根据我们的计算，我们相信我们已经降落在苏禄星群的某个岛屿上。
Mr. Dele and I, from our calculations, we believe that we have landed on an island somewhere in the Sulu cluster.

553
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,327
我们不知道是哪个岛。
We don't know which island.

554
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:58,901
问题是应答器被闪电击中的地方和这里之间的区域太大了，搜索和救援可能需要一些时间。
The problem is the area between where the transponder was struck by lightning to here is so vast that search and rescue could take some time.

555
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,314
-上帝啊。-要花多长时间?
- Jesus Christ. - How long is it gonna take?

556
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,775
我们还得定量配给食物和水。
We're also gonna have to ration food and water.

557
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,646
你的下一步是什么?烟雾信号?
What's your next move? Smoke signals?

558
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,995
你能保密吗?
Can you just keep it to yourself?

559
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,538
饶了他吧。至少他让飞机降落了。
Cut him a break. At least he landed the plane.

560
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:08,694
我们没有撞车。
We didn't crash.

561
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,019
我们现在在荒郊野外。
We're in the middle of nowhere though.

562
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,542
-我们被困了。-是啊，拜托，伙计。
- We're stranded. - Yeah, come on, man.

563
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:14,003
我们没有撞车，伙计。
We didn't crash, man.

564
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:17,180
听着，昨晚，我们飞过了一个设施。
Listen, last night, we flew over some kind of facility.

565
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:20,532
我希望他们有电话或收音机。
I'm hoping they have a phone or a radio.

566
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:24,753
如果我能到达那里，和他们取得联系，几小时后我们就能获救。
If I can get there, make contact, we could be rescued in hours.

567
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:30,716
在那之前，每个人都要小心因为我们不知道丛林里发生了什么。
Until then, I need everybody to be careful because we don't know what's going on in that jungle.

568
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:32,215
-我和你一起去。-我也要去。
- I'll go with you. - I will come, too.

569
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,632
我很感激。
I appreciate it.

570
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,243
但加斯帕尔先生好心地主动提出要来。
But Mr. Gaspare has kindly volunteered to come.

571
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,375
什么?
What?

572
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,811
你要带着手铐带走一个人?
You're taking a guy in handcuffs?

573
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,421
是有意义的。
Makes sense.

574
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:03,575
来吧。
Come on.

575
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,436
酋长!
Datu!

576
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,134
酋长!
Datu!

577
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,094
酋长!
Datu!

578
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:39,540
我们正在竭尽所能地寻找119航班，不惜一切代价。
Well, we're doing everything we possibly can to find Flight 119, sparing no expense.

579
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,369
你确定飞机已经坠毁了吗?
Have you determined that the plane has crashed?

580
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,545
不，我不是这么想的。
Uh, no, that's not the assumption.

581
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,349
-我们只有很少…-你确定是爸爸的航班?
- We have very little... - You sure it's Dad's flight?

582
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:47,940
-我们正在协调…-我确定。
- We are coordinating... - I'm sure.

583
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,308
该地区的搜救工作。
The search and rescue efforts in the region.

584
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:50,595
不。
No.

585
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:54,773
一旦我们有了最新消息，希望是积极的消息，我们会马上给你回复。
As soon as we have some updates, hopefully some positive news, we'll get right back to you.

586
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,002
我偷看了你们警官的包找补给。
I peeked through your officer's bag for supplies.

587
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:11,050
我发现了你的小折刀。
I came across your pocketknife.

588
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:13,443
你以前是军人吗?
You former military or something'?

589
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:15,271
伞兵突击队。
Groupe des Commandos Parachutistes.

590
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,057
法国外籍军团。
French Foreign Legion.

591
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,583
薪水和福利很糟糕，但如果你能搞定，他们不会问任何问题。
Pay and benefits suck, but they don't ask any questions if you can hack it.

592
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,585
问题吗?
Questions?

593
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,674
没有什么是非黑即白的，上尉。
Nothing's black and white, Captain.

594
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:29,372
我只是在错误的时间出现在了错误的地点。
I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.

595
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:30,736
没人在乎到底发生了什么。
No one cares what really happened.

596
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:34,987
我18岁就上过床。
I was 18 and fucked.

597
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:39,078
所以，我逃了，加入了军团，而不是烂在监狱里。
So, rather than, uh, rot in prison, I ran, joined the Legion.

598
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,820
故事结束了。
End of story.

599
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:42,951
你怎么被抓的?
How'd you get caught?

600
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,390
算了吧。没关系。
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

601
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,091
现在让我问你一件事。
Now let me ask you something.

602
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,224
你把我的刀带来了吗?
Did you bring my knife?

603
00:42:57,662 --> 00:42:58,663
对不起,没有。
Sorry, no.

604
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,752
我把它放在包里了。
I left it in the bag.

605
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:03,581
那死去警官的枪呢?
How about the dead officer's gun?

606
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,548
我们现在应该快接近了。
We should be getting close about now.

607
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,215
布罗迪托兰斯。

608
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:31,957
苏格兰人，英国公民。皇家空军。

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,741
然后坐了20年的商业飞机。

610
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:36,526
从纽约到伦敦，巴黎，东京。Hot-shit路线。
New York to London, Paris, Tokyo. Hot-shit routes.

611
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:42,576
从那以后，他飞过埃及，meridian, Frontier和Trailblazer，都是三线航线。
Since then, he's been flying Egypt, Meridiana, Frontier and Trailblazer, flying shit third-tier routes.

612
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,144
——为什么?发生了什么事?—查看视频文件。
- Why? What happened? - Check the video file.

613
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:48,147
嘿，我的饮料呢?
Hey, where's my drink?

614
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,497
-天啊。-我十分钟前就请你喝了
- Oh, Jesus. - I asked you for a drink, like, 10 minutes ago.

615
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,648
你想要什么?滚出去。
What do you want? Get out of here.

616
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:52,804
嘿，嘿，嘿!
Hey, hey, hey!

617
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,283
这到底是怎么回事……
What the hell is going...

618
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,641
还能更糟吗?
Can this get any worse?

619
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,169
这是正确的。这是正确的。
That's right. That's right.

620
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,780
我喜欢这家伙。
I like this guy.

621
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:36,717
天呐
Holy shit.

622
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:22,736
他妈的。好的。
Fuck. Okay.

623
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,831
约翰·谢尔巴克，我是大卫·斯卡斯代尔。
John Shellback, it's David Scarsdale.

624
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,354
你现在怎么样?
What's your status?

625
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:35,357
我们正在准备装货。应该在9点起飞。
We're prepping to load now. Should be in the air 0900.

626
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:38,317
求你了，斯卡迪，告诉我我们要回澳门。
Please, Scardy, tell me we're going back to Macau.

627
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,756
申请飞往马尼拉的飞行计划，我们看看事情会如何发展。
File a flight plan for Manila, and we'll see how things shake out.

628
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,715
你是说你根本不知道这架飞机在哪?
Are you telling me you have no idea where this plane actually is?

629
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,282
它不在澳门。我可以告诉你。
It's not in Macau. I can tell you that.

630
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,984
这是额外的，斯卡迪。这是额外的。
That's gonna be extra, Scardy. That's going to be extra.

631
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,507

出去了。

他们在路上了。
They're on their way.

634
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:03,559
他们会在三小时内到达那片区域，一旦我们知道飞机位置就跳伞。
They'll reach the area in about three hours, then parachute in once we get the plane's location.

635
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,217
应急基金有多少?
So, how much in the emergency fund?

636
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:10,523
百万的一半。
Half million.

637
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:14,788
太好了。这可能足以让我们中的一个从印尼监狱里出来。——在这里。
Great. That might be enough to get one of us - out of Indonesian prison. - Here.

638
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,096
-没事吧，孩子们?-现在很好。给你，老板。
- Are we good, boys? - Good now. There you go, boss.

639
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:30,543

这是紧急情况

I'm Captain Brodie Torrance. Trailblazer 119.

644
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:59,093
我们下到了苏禄海的一个岛上。
We've gone down on an island in the Sulu Sea.

645
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:00,244
对不起，我不明白。
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

646
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:03,315
我是布罗迪·托伦斯上尉。
My name is Captain Brodie Torrance.

00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,361
我是开拓者119号的队长。
And I'm the captain of Trailblazer 119.

648
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:12,672
现在，我们往下走。我们迫降在…先生，我们一整天都接到骚扰电话。——没有。喂?
Now, we've gone down. We made a crash landing on... Sir, we've been getting crank calls - all day about this. - No. Hello?

649
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,543
我明白了。我在这里。
I hear you. I'm here.

650
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:16,652
现在我需要你马上帮我接通紧急行动组
Now, I need you to patch me through to emergency ops immediately.

651
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:18,610
听着，我们一整天都接到这事的电话。
Listen, we've been getting calls all day about this.

652
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:20,549
-闭嘴，听我说。-冷静，先生。
- Just shut up and listen. - Calm down, sir.

653
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,160
-我们一直…——对不起。

654
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:24,597
关于这起失踪案整天都有骚扰电话。
Crank calls all day long about this disappearance.

655
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,121
现在，你能告诉我你的员工徽章号码吗?
Now, can you tell me your employee badge number.

656
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:30,559
他妈的。

Listen, we've been getting calls all day about this.

01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,613
-闭嘴，听我说。-冷静，先生。
- Just shut up and listen. - Calm down, sir.

796
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:23,337
在电话被切断后，托伦斯打电话给他在毛伊岛的女儿丹妮拉。
After that call was cut off, Torrance phoned his daughter, Daniela, in Maui.

797
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:25,905
她证实了录音的细节。
She confirmed the details of the recording.

798
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:29,691
她说他告诉她他们在霍洛岛群的某个地方沉没了。
And she said he told her they went down somewhere in the Jolo island cluster.

799
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:33,521
我需要钥匙洞卫星进入这片区域找到那架飞机。
I need Key Hole satellite access to this area to find that plane.

800
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:37,656
我们的资产要空运了，我们会绕着乔洛集群转直到找到他们的空投地点。
Our assets are going airborne, and we'll circle the Jolo cluster until we get them a drop location.

801
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,354
但我需要你找些人帮忙，帮我搞定。-知道了。
But I need you to call in some favors - and make it happen. - Got it.

802
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:02,637
干得好，德勒。
Good job, Dele.

803
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:48,466
Passen……
Passen...

804
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:31,988
Dandulit村是一条路进，一条路出。
Dandulit village is one road in, one road out.

805
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:36,644
这对我有用吗?
Is this any use to me?

806
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:38,646
你会说他加禄语?
You speak Tagalog?

807
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,291
是的，她正在接电源。
Yeah, she's plugging it in now.

808
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:58,164
等等，我有…我认为……-我们知道了。我们知道了。-我们到了。
Wait, I got... I think... - We got it. We got it. - We're there.

809
01:06:58,188 --> 01:07:00,190
找到了。戴夫，找到飞机了。
Found it. Dave, found the plane.

810
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:04,020
霍洛岛岛。托伦斯是对的。站在。
Jolo island. Torrance was right. Stand by.

811
01:07:07,545 --> 01:07:08,676
就是这样。
And there it is.

812
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,809
真不敢相信它完好无损。
Can't believe it's intact.

813
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:12,854
现在把坐标发给我们的线人。
Sending the coordinates to our assets now.

814
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:14,813
他们会尽快到现场。
They'll drop on-site ASAP.

815
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,075
嗯，真的没必要。
Well, there's really no need.

816
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,531
他们会联系菲律宾政府。
They'll contact the Philippine government.

817
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:21,317
当然，他们会派地方当局进行搜索和救援。-不会那么容易的，特里。
Surely, they'll send local authorities - with a search and rescue. - It won't be that easy, Terry.

818
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:24,170
——为什么?-因为霍洛岛没有权威。
- Why? - Because there is no authority on Jolo island.

819
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:25,911
由分裂分子和民兵控制。
It's run by separatists and militias.

820
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:27,869
菲律宾军队都不会再去那里了。
The Filipino army won't even go there anymore.

821
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:30,437
他们被打得太惨了。
They got their asses kicked so many times.

822
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:32,700
听着，他们会空降的。
Look, the guys will parachute in.

823
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:35,007
但他们需要人帮忙把所有人都救出来。
But they're gonna need some help getting everyone out.

824
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:48,803
村子在那个方向两公里处。
The village is two kilometers in that direction.

825
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:50,718
你知道你不能就这么把它们要回来。
You know you can't just ask for them back.

826
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,156
好吧，你是军人。
Yeah, well, you're the military man.

827
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,853
我希望你能给点建议。
I was hoping you'd have some ideas.

828
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,378

谢谢你！为帮助。
Thank you... for helping.

867
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:48,287
-拉上拉链。我们抓到他们了-这不可接受。
- Zip 'em up. We got 'em. - That's unacceptable.

868
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:52,030
这是不可接受的。你告诉他们是我说的。
That is unacceptable. You tell 'em I said that.

869
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:57,383
没有一个营的部队支援，菲律宾人是不会派出救援队的。

一旦他们走了，就完了。

我们必须悄悄做这件事。

除非万不得已，否则别拿枪。

就这些吗?这就是你的计划?

I'm not sure what got through, but they know we're alive.

So, they find that plane, and they find us. All right?

917
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,243
等等，等等，等等。

There's a bunch of armed fuckers on the road.

919
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:41,292

We're gonna get mowed down if we try to drive past them.

920
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,947
我可以和他们交战，但只会引来更多的敌人。
I can engage 'em, but it's just gonna draw more of 'em.

921
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:47,472

好吧，我能搞定这些家伙。
Okay, I can handle these guys.

923
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:03,836
你打算怎么做?
How are you gonna do that?

924
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:08,711
我要分散他们的注意力。我要自首了。
I'm gonna distract them. I'm gonna give myself up.

925
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:13,933

- That's your plan? - Oh, you have a better one?

926
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:18,895
听着，我们没有其他选择。
Look, we don't have any other choice.

927
01:17:18,938 --> 01:17:21,245
你再也见不到你该死的家人了。
You're never gonna see your goddamn family again.

928
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,900
他们的家人呢?
What about their families?

929
01:17:25,205 --> 01:17:27,512
你知道我必须努力，对吧?
Look, you know I have to try, right?

930
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:29,949
我是说，我是队长。
I mean, I'm the captain.

931
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:32,473
这些混蛋不会杀我的。对他们来说太值钱了。
These assholes are never gonna kill me. Worth too much to them.

932
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:35,607
是的。
Yeah.

933
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,653
在这儿等着。把这个。
Wait here. Take this.

934
01:17:54,278 --> 01:17:56,367
喂?有人知道吗?
Hello? Anyone?

935
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:02,982
我要和君玛谈谈。
I need to speak to Junmar.

936
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:07,160
我没有武器!
And I'm unarmed!

937
01:18:07,204 --> 01:18:09,510
不，我是船长。我是这里的飞行员。
No, I'm the captain. I'm the pilot here.

938
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:22,001
你是飞行员?队长托兰斯?
You're a pilot? Captain Torrance?

939
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:26,658
我要和君玛谈谈。
I need to speak to Junmar.

940
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,705
酋长Junmar。
Datu Junmar.

941
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:52,771
其他飞行员说你会让乘客打电话求助。
Other pilot say you leave passengers to call for help.

942
01:18:54,338 --> 01:18:55,339
你觉得怎么样?
How that go for you?

943
01:18:59,256 --> 01:19:01,214
我是来找你谈这个的。
I came to talk to you about that.

944
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:03,869
我联系了马尼拉。
I contacted Manila.

945
01:19:04,609 --> 01:19:09,440
他们派了很多士兵来搜救我们。
They send, uh, search and rescue for us, lots of soldiers.

946
01:19:09,483 --> 01:19:12,573
所以，我的乘客会回来的，谢谢。
So, I'll be having my passengers back, thank you.

947
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:23,933
你以为你来这里，跟我说话，告诉我按你说的做。
You think you come here, speak to me, tell me do what you say.

948
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:27,414
你倒着想。
You think backwards.

949
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,768
你现在在霍洛，托伦斯飞行员。
You in Jolo now, Pilot Torrance.

950
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:35,945
没有救援。
No rescue coming.

951
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:40,819
听着，我们在空中遇到了问题。
Look, we had problems in the air.

952
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:42,821
我不得不让飞机降落。
I had to land the plane.

953
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:46,433
我的人只想回家。
My people just want to go home.

954
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:48,392
-你能理解的。-他们现在是我的人了。
- You can understand. - They're my people now.

955
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:50,568
你是我的。
You're mine.

956
01:19:51,308 --> 01:19:52,396
不管是什么原因。
No matter why.

957
01:19:53,876 --> 01:19:55,660
霍洛的一切都是我的。
Everything in Jolo belong to me.

958
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,749
直到我不想要。
Until I don't want.

959
01:20:04,756 --> 01:20:06,802
没人在乎小男人什么时候死。
No one care when small man die.

960
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:09,543
但我要杀鸡儆猴吗?
But I make example of big man?

961
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:11,850
我杀了他?
I kill him?

962
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:16,507
现在他们在乎了。现在他们付出了代价。
Now they care. Now they pay.

963
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:21,991
去你妈的。
Fuck you.

964
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:25,777
Hajan。
Hajan.

965
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,040
他们是友军，上尉。待在原地别动。待在原地别动。
They're friendlies, Captain. Stay where you are. Stay where you are.

966
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:49,540
你疼吗?
You hurt?

967
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,499
托伦斯上尉，你受伤了吗?
Captain Torrance, are you hurt?

968
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,066
不，我没事。
No, I'm okay.

969
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:55,502
我们完好无损地拿到了包裹。
We got the package intact.

970
01:20:55,546 --> 01:20:58,549
东排，主楼。如何复制?老水手,完毕。
Eastern row, main house. How copy? Shellback, out.

971
01:20:58,592 --> 01:21:00,396
-莱克，你收到包裹了。-不，等等。拿其他的。
- Lake, you got the package. - No, wait. Take the others.

972
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,031
嘿，我们抓到他们了。让我们动起来!
Hey, we got them. Let's move!

973
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:06,513
动!
Move!

974
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:10,996
动!移动!
Move! Move in!

975
01:21:15,087 --> 01:21:16,610
有你。移动。
Got you. Move.

976
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:21,093
-大家都没事吧?-所有人，趴下!
- Everybody okay? - Everybody, get down!

977
01:21:21,137 --> 01:21:22,660
滚出去!现在就出发!
Roll out! Roll out now!

978
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:31,451
Hajan !
Hajan!

979
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:36,108
Hajan。
Hajan.

980
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:53,734
你被打得很惨，队长。你感觉怎么样?
Took a hell of a beating, Captain. How are you feeling?

981
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:55,084
好的。好的,谢谢。
Okay. Okay, thanks.

982
01:21:56,128 --> 01:21:57,738
你们是谁?
Who are you guys?

983
01:21:57,782 --> 01:21:59,194
我们是开拓者号的先遣队。
We're Trailblazer's forward advance crew on this.

984
01:21:59,218 --> 01:22:00,916
约翰·艾萨克。莫，威利斯和莱克。
John Isaac. Mo, Willis, and Lake.

985
01:22:02,787 --> 01:22:04,093
所以，等等。
So, hold on.

986
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:05,268
你们是先遣队。
You're the advance crew.

987
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,097
救援队什么时候到?
When is the rescue team getting here?

988
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:14,190
24小时是开拓者最多能做的，所以，不幸的是，我们成了救援队。
Twenty-four hours is the best Trailblazer can do, so, unfortunately, we just became the rescue team.

989
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:15,365
24小时。
Twenty-four hours.

990
01:22:16,888 --> 01:22:18,542
那时候我们还没走。
We won't be left by then.

991
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:21,458
我明白，所以我们得想个应急方案。
I understand, and that's why we need to work up a contingency.

992
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:29,770
我们确实带了应急基金，但还不够我们离开这个岛。所以…你说我们该怎么办，上尉?
Now, we did bring an emergency fund, but not enough to buy our way off this island. So... What do you suggest we do, Captain?

993
01:22:35,559 --> 01:22:36,647
他妈的。
Fuck.

994
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:40,085
我有个计划。
I got a plan.

995
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:43,567
不，这不是假设。
No, that's not the assumption.

996
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:45,525
目前我们掌握的信息很少。
We have very little information at present.

997
01:22:45,569 --> 01:22:49,312
但是，我们正在协调该地区的所有搜救工作。
However, we are coordinating with all the search and rescue efforts in the region.

998
01:22:49,355 --> 01:22:50,487
希望……
Hopefully...

999
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:08,374
爸爸。
Dad.

1000
01:23:11,073 --> 01:23:12,813
我不知道你能不能听懂，但是…
I don't know if you'll get this, but...

1001
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:16,992
我太爱你了。
I love you so much.

1002
01:23:19,516 --> 01:23:21,561
您是最了不起的父亲。
You are the most amazing father.

1003
01:23:22,867 --> 01:23:25,174
如果我说得不够多，我很抱歉。
And I'm sorry if I don't say it enough.

1004
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:27,897
我不知道发生了什么。
I don't know what's happening.

1005
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:30,962
或者你受伤了。
Or if you're hurt.

1006
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:34,444
我好害怕。
I'm so scared.

1007
01:23:36,663 --> 01:23:38,013
所以，请回家吧。
So, just please come home.

1008
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,026
开拓者CP，这里是Shellback 6号。
Trailblazer CP, this is Shellback 6.

1009
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:53,811
等一下，收到，6。你现在怎么样?
Let's wait a sec. Copy, 6. What's your status?

1010
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:56,422
人质安全，但我们有另一个计划。
Hostages secure, but we've got another plan.

1011
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:57,728
你不会喜欢的。
You're not gonna like it.

1012
01:23:57,771 --> 01:23:58,859
来吧。每个人,快点。
Come on. Everybody, hurry.

1013
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:00,165
快跑，快跑，快跑!
Run, run, run!

1014
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:01,558
嘿，把他们聚集在这里。
Hey, gather them here.

1015
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:03,342
-大家，来吧。-围过来。
- Everyone, come on. - Gather around.

1016
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:05,214
来吧!
Come on!

1017
01:24:05,257 --> 01:24:11,481
现在，在未来24小时内，不会有完整的救援队伍很快到来。
Now, there is no full rescue team coming anytime soon, not for the next 24 hours.

1018
01:24:11,524 --> 01:24:13,091
——什么?-我们等不及了。
- What? - We can't wait.

1019
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:17,922
他们会使出浑身解数来对付我们，我们会死的。
They are gonna come at us with everything they've got, and we're not gonna survive.

1020
01:24:17,965 --> 01:24:21,621
我和德勒设法恢复了飞机上的电力。
Now, Dele and I managed to get the power back up on the plane.

1021
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:22,883
来自西区。
From the west end.

1022
01:24:22,927 --> 01:24:25,103
我们只有一次机会。
We only have one chance.

1023
01:24:25,147 --> 01:24:27,627
那就是我开着这玩意飞出去。
And that is me flying us out of here in this thing.

1024
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:28,822
-等等，等等。什么?-不可能。
- Wait, wait, wait. What? - No way in hell.

1025
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:30,978
-我知道。-听着，听着。
- I know. - Listen, listen.

1026
01:24:31,022 --> 01:24:33,285
听，听，听!
Listen, listen, listen!

1027
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:37,420
如果我不相信能成功，我就不会把你们放回飞机上。
If I didn't believe it could be done, I would not put you guys back on that plane.

1028
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:40,814
我有一个女儿。
I have a daughter.

1029
01:24:40,858 --> 01:24:44,905
我很想再次拥抱她，然后回家。
I have every intention of hugging her again and making it home.

1030
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:48,083
我告诉你，回家的路就在这架飞机上。
And I'm telling you that the way home is on this plane.

1031
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,563
我已经带你到这里了。
I've got you this far.

1032
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:53,566
我只需要你再相信我一点。好吗?
I just need you to trust me this one more bit. Okay?

1033
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:55,283
-好的，飞行前检查。-收到。
- All right, preflight checks. - Copy that.

1034
01:24:55,307 --> 01:24:56,893
-大家跟着德勒先生。-跟我来。
- Everybody, follow Mr. Dele. - Follow me, come on.

1035
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:58,789
——好的。好吧。-来吧!
- Okay. All right. - Come on!

1036
01:25:01,574 --> 01:25:02,836
来吧!
Come on!

1037
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,360
Shellback，我还能活多久?
Shellback, how long have I got?

1038
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:05,535
最多两分钟。
Two minutes tops.

1039
01:25:05,578 --> 01:25:10,279
不能确定已经造成的损坏不会影响飞行特性，也不能确定引擎不会失灵。
Can't be certain the damage already done won't affect flight characteristics or that the engines won't fail.

1040
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:11,584
Shellback说可以做到。
Shellback said it can be done.

1041
01:25:11,628 --> 01:25:12,759
他是地面上的人。
He's the man on the ground.

1042
01:25:12,803 --> 01:25:15,260
由于缺乏适当的检查，他没有资格作出那项决定。
Short of proper inspection, he's not qualified to make that determination.

1043
01:25:15,284 --> 01:25:16,850
他们被追捕了，特里。
They're being hunted, Terry.

1044
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:18,417
你说的是检查?
And you're talking about inspections?

1045
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:24,031
在他们经历了这么多之后，想象一下如果我允许托伦斯驾驶那架飞机并烧死飞机上的所有人会有什么后果。
After all they've been through, imagine the fallout if I allow Torrance to fly that plane and incinerate everybody in it.

1046
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:25,685
想象一下如果你不这样做的后果。
Imagine the fallout if you don't.

1047
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:27,098
确保他们顺利上车。来吧。
Make sure they get on okay. Come on.

1048
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,862
快跑，快跑，快跑!
Run, run, run!

1049
01:25:33,693 --> 01:25:34,781
每个人都在。
Everybody on.

1050
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,536
来吧。我们走吧。我们走吧，玛丽亚。
Come on. Let's go. Let's go, Maria.

1051
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,531
啊,操。
Ah, fuck.

1052
01:25:46,967 --> 01:25:48,380
马上就会有一堆坏人找我们麻烦了。
We're about to have a lot of bad guys up our asses.

1053
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:49,903
我需要你加快速度，队长。
I'm gonna need you to pick up the pace, Cap.

1054
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:54,410
-好吧。-我们在这里和这里有两个车队，看起来第三个车队也不远了。
- All right. - We've got two convoys here and here, and it looks like a third is not far behind.

1055
01:25:54,453 --> 01:25:55,778
好吧。我得先把刹车修好。
All right. I gotta fix this brake first.

1056
01:25:55,802 --> 01:25:57,978
-你得给我争取点时间-知道了。
- You gotta buy me some time. - Got it.

1057
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:05,464
就像她说的，走吧。我们走吧。
Like she said, let's go. Let's go.

1058
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:17,955
——移动!——邦妮!
- Move! - Bonnie!

1059
01:26:17,998 --> 01:26:19,435
我知道了，上尉!的帮助!
I got it, Captain! Help!

1060
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:21,654
继续前进。
Keep moving.

1061
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:29,488
动!我找不到他。
Move! I can't get him.

1062

1063
01:26:33,013 --> 01:26:35,102
该走了，上尉!该走了!

老水手!Shellback，我需要通讯。

已经在团队频道播出了。

1068
01:27:59,099 --> 01:28:01,232
一旦我启动引擎，你有两分钟时间。

1069
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,321

- I'll leave the stairs down. - Roger that.

1070
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:07,107
你知道我不能和你一起上飞机。
You know I can't get on that plane with you.

1071

你也是，我的船长。

1073
01:28:46,886 --> 01:28:49,236
想办法把他绑起来，邦妮。

1074
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,934
大家都趴下，好吗?

1075
01:28:50,977 --> 01:28:52,979
再陪我一段时间。
Just hang with me just a little bit longer.

1076
01:28:53,023 --> 01:28:55,025
如果不重启舱门就封不上。
The cabin doors won't seal without a reset.

1077
01:28:55,068 --> 01:28:57,810
所有的门都打开，好吗?所以它们是平衡的。
Keep them open, all of them, okay? So they're balanced.

1078
01:28:59,638 --> 01:29:02,685
航空电子设备仍然故障。屏幕上什么都没有。
Avionics still shot. Nothing on screens.

1079
01:29:02,728 --> 01:29:04,948
检查了液压系统。它们看起来不错。

1080
01:29:04,991 --> 01:29:06,384
好的。APU工作吗?

下来!
Get down!

1088
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:34,412
大便。我没子弹了。

我需要你和我在一起，黛勒。
I need you with me, Dele.

1093
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:18,761
集中注意力。
Keep your focus in here.

1094
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:20,763
嘿，进入直播。
Hey, into the live.

1095
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:23,026
让我们把它转过来。
Let's turn this baby around.

1096
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:38,998
他们击中了我们的油箱，我们就完了。
They hit our fuel tanks, we're toast.

1097
01:30:49,879 --> 01:30:51,141
我是托伦斯上尉。
This is Captain Torrance.

1098
01:30:51,184 --> 01:30:53,360
有人在吗?
Is anyone there?

1099
01:30:53,404 --> 01:30:55,754
有人在吗，该死的?我要走了。
Is anyone there, God damn it? I'm about to take off.

01:30:55,798 --> 01:30:58,496
上尉，你听我说。那架飞机就在她所在的地方。
Captain, you listen to me. That plane stays right where she is.

-明白了吗?-托伦斯上尉，我叫大卫·斯卡斯代尔。告诉我你需要什么。
- Am I understood? - Captain Torrance, my name is David Scarsdale. Tell me what you need.

我需要方向性的帮助。
I need directional assistance.

1103
01:31:04,284 --> 01:31:07,157
我们没有雷达，也没有导航。我们完全是手工操作。
We have no radar, no nav. We are fully manual.

1104
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,725
我想我们最多还有300英里。

给我找个地方降落。
Find me a place to land.

1106

1111
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:30,572
我们走吧!
Let's go!

1112
01:31:39,624 --> 01:31:41,234
我们有足够的路吗?
Do we have enough road?

1113
01:31:41,278 --> 01:31:42,322
必须如此。
It's gonna have to be.

1114
01:31:43,106 --> 01:31:44,760
Gaspare,移动!动!
Gaspare, move! Move!

1115
01:31:47,763 --> 01:31:48,807
Gaspare,移动!

1116
01:31:53,595 --> 01:31:54,726

01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:55,814
来吧!
Come on!

1118
01:32:01,646 --> 01:32:02,865
我们走吧!
Let's go!

1119
01:32:03,605 --> 01:32:05,258
我的翅膀清晰。
My wing clear.

1120
01:32:05,302 --> 01:32:06,564
我的翅膀是干净的。
My wing is clear.

1121
01:32:10,742 --> 01:32:12,178
不能再等了，Shellback。
Can't wait any longer, Shellback.

1122
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:13,223
你现在怎么样?

1123
01:32:14,746 --> 01:32:16,443
继续。带我们上去，船长。

1124
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:32,547
下来!
Get down!

1125
01:32:51,914 --> 01:32:53,089
搞什么鬼?
What the fuck?

1126
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:26,470
全油门。
Full throttle.

1127
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:10,296
队长，你的肩膀。
Cap, your shoulder.

1128
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,820
我很好。
I'm okay.

1129
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:17,782
我们失去动力了，右引擎。
We're losing power, right engine.

1130
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:19,218
-关闭。——不!

1131
01:34:19,262 --> 01:34:21,699
我们需要所有的推力。
We need all the thrust we can get.

1132
01:34:21,743 --> 01:34:24,876
-我们要撞上了。我们要撞上了。-保存左引擎。
- We're gonna hit. We're gonna hit. - Save left engine.

1133
01:34:27,749 --> 01:34:28,750
来吧。
Come on.

1134
01:34:37,889 --> 01:34:40,413
右引擎失灵。现在就把它关掉。
Lost right engine. Shut it down now.

1135
01:34:40,457 --> 01:34:41,545
关闭两个。
Shutting down two.

1136
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:50,162
有多糟糕?
How bad?

1137
01:34:50,206 --> 01:34:52,382
右翼后缘受损。
Right wing's trailing edge is damaged.

1138
01:34:52,425 --> 01:34:54,689
大便。好吧，盯着点。
Shit. Okay, just keep an eye on it.

1139
01:34:55,777 --> 01:34:57,343
这里是开拓者119号。
This is Trailblazer 119.

1140
01:34:58,431 --> 01:34:59,911
我们空降。
We're airborne.

1141
01:34:59,955 --> 01:35:03,654
开拓者119号，收到你的航速135节。
Trailblazer 119, reading your air speed at 135 knots.

高度400英尺。

1145
01:35:09,355 --> 01:35:12,097
你得让她升到3000，不然她就睡不着了。
You need to take her up to 3,000 or she's not staying up.

1146
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:14,230
没有速度和高度。

1147
01:35:14,273 --> 01:35:16,536
119号，你得马上带她上去。
119, you need to take her up now.

1148
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,582
我们没有该死的门。
We have no fucking doors.

1149
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:23,892
我们降压了，燃料不足了，我们刚刚失去了一个引擎。别跟我说我已经知道的事。
We're depressurized, we're low on fuel and we just lost an engine. Now, don't tell me what I already know.

1150
01:35:23,935 --> 01:35:25,415
给我找个地方降落。

正在调出可用机场的名单。

让我们把它放到屏幕上。

最好的选择，西亚岛，正南50英里。
Best option, Siasi Island, 50 miles due south.

1154
01:35:36,469 --> 01:35:39,298
调整你的航向到15度。那里有一个小机场。
Adjust your heading to 15 degrees. There's a small airport there.

1155
01:35:39,342 --> 01:35:40,735
你能来吗?
Can you make it?

1156
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:42,606
我们会找到答案的。
We're gonna find out.

1157
01:35:43,694 --> 01:35:45,914
丛林中清除。脚湿了。

失去右侧控制。

1161
01:36:01,712 --> 01:36:02,713
失去高度。

1162
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:11,374

1163
01:36:13,419 --> 01:36:15,465
准备降落!
Prepare for landing!

1164
01:36:15,508 --> 01:36:17,423
准备好撞击!准备好撞击!

1165
01:36:30,436 --> 01:36:31,611
完全倒车。
Full reverse on one.

1166
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,962

祝贺你,每一个人。谢谢你！

1173
01:37:25,535 --> 01:37:26,753
你没事吧?

1174
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:31,019
我有过更好的日子。
I've had better days.

1175
01:37:33,935 --> 01:37:35,055
一次一分钟，对吧?

1176
01:37:36,546 --> 01:37:37,634
一次一分钟。
One minute at a time.

1177
01:38:10,406 --> 01:38:11,842
你是个很棒的飞行员，上尉。

1178
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,452
