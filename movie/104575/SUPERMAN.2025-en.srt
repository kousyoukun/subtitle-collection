1
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,451
Stop...
stop !

2
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,250
Crypto!

2.1
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,950
Take me home!

3
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Home!

4
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
How many?

5
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
No.

6
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,300
No need to thank us, sir, as we will not
appreciate it.

7
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
We have no consciousness whatsoever.

8
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,160
Merely a tomatom is here to serve.

9
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Meet 12.

10
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
She's new.

11
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,860
He looked at you.

12
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,840
I put your parents' message on to soothe
you.

13
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,580
Thank you.

14
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,540
He finds it soothing.

15
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,220
You are the one who made him.

16
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,680
And you are the one who made him.

17
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,020
But I will not forget when I will be a
young sassichi.

18
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,560
I will not forget.

19
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,940
I am Krypton.

20
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,880
You are the one who made him.

21
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,860
I am Ratija.

22
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,020
What are you doing?

23
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
What are you doing?

24
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,600
The message was damaged in transit from
Krypton to Earth.

25
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
But what is there?

26
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
And you are the one who made him.

27
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,321
We love you more than heaven, our son.

28
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,720
We love you more than land.

29
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,580
Our beloved hope will soon be gone
forever.

30
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,280
But hope vitalizes our hearts.

31
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,820
And that hope is you, Kal-El.

32
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,280
We have searched the universe for a home
where you can do the most good.

33
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,240
And live out Krypton's truth.

34
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,860
That place is Earth.

35
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,180
And the rest of the message is lost.

36
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,700
14 fractured bones.

37
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Damage to bladder, kidney, large
intestine, lungs.

38
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,440
Our poor superman.

39
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
With a healthy dose of Yellow Sun we will
have him up and adamant no time.

40
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
Nooooooo!

41
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,640
He landed somewhere near here.

42
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,180
I can't see where.

43
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,140
Well, keep looking.

44
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,650
Sir, you are only 83% restored to health.

45
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,651
You must rest.

46
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,570
No can do, Fore.

47
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,870
I gotta get back to the Frey.

48
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,970
But this Hammerfellow just beat you at
full power.

49
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,690
Sir?

50
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,090
What is this?

51
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,050
Krypto!

52
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,590
What the hey, dude?

53
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,810
I thought you destroyed the whole superman
robot.

54
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,466
I thought I told you to keep an eye on
him.

55
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,470
We feed the canine, but he is unruly.

56
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,382
And he realizes we are not
flesh and blood and couldn't

57
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:29,510
in our heart of hearts care
less whether he lives or dies.

58
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,230
Stop, Krypto.

59
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,250
He's leaving.

60
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,050
Ow!

61
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,530
Ow!

62
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,690
Stop!

63
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,670
Krypto!

64
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,050
Ow!

65
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:36,410
Ow!

66
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:36,850
Stop!

67
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:37,710
Stop!

68
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:37,910
Sit!

69
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,590
Sit!

70
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,870
Stay!

71
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,320
The alien is on its way back.

72
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,590
And counting...
...and counting...

73
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,230
I'm inside Chocos, Larry.

74
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,090
No fatalities.

75
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,330
I can't win.

76
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
anymore.

77
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
12C.

78
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
18A.

79
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,730
34B.

80
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,870
Down!

81
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,560
He's been studying him for years.

82
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,040
He's developed over 2,500 fight rules for
this situation.

83
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
Superman!

84
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:15,940
Bravo.

85
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
You got him.

86
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Malik Ali.

87
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,040
A local.

88
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,360
Max, we have the engineer.

89
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
The target has led us to the ice castle.

90
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
The rumors are true.

91
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,860
I don't know how in the hell...
...thing hasn't been spoiled.

92
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,360
We hear that...

93
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,620
...comes two to one.

94
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,220
Holy... ...like the entire structure
has descended into the ice.

95
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
And we have what we need.

96
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,600
Return to base.

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,180
I can't really do it, Max.

98
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,720
Your pride won't be making our choices
today, Angela.

99
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,220
Thank you.

100
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,960
We'll need more than you when we get
there.

101
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Comes one to two.

102
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,580
Tell them what we need to do.

103
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,780
Wrap it up.

104
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,720
The United States will continue to feel
the wrath... ...of the hammer of the radio.

105
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,630
Once again, you free fella.

106
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,786
When you saved your women from being
attacked... ...are you all right, Superman?

107
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,050
No, you gotta get out of here.

108
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,051
It's not safe.

109
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,550
You saved us so many times.

110
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,710
Now it's our turn.

111
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,850
Maybe you should have done that
thing in Jarhand... ...or Superman.

112
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,630
Ken, Ken.

113
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,730
Sorry, Barry.

114
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,670
Hey, loser.

115
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,010
Hey, Steve.

116
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,390
Hey, what do you got against adverbs,
Ken?

117
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,810
How are we supposed to know how
we feel... ...when we read this monarchy?

118
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:57,911
In sports writing, you learn
the sentence... ...is the modifier.

119
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,450
Hey, Ma.

120
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,270
Ma!

121
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,970
Hey, Clark.

122
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,870
Me and Pa... ...just wanted to come and
say... ...congratulations on that crap page.

123
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Boy, that is something.

124
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,891
Hey, ask Ma if she barbecued you
up... ...in either Roadkill or Chitlin.

125
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,090
What's that, Clark?

126
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,710
Sorry, Ma.

127
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,670
Just in the middle of the picture.

128
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,750
What are Chitlins?

129
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,390
Chitlins are intestines.

130
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,310
Thanks, Cap.

131
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,670
You read this crud?

132
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,590
I thought it was great, Clark.

133
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:26,870
Great?

134
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,870
Yeah.

135
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,410
Big time.

136
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,750
Why did we not want to keep you...

137
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,730
...but, uh... ...wanted
to say congrats...

138
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,970
...and tell you word that about you,
Clark.

139
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,450
It's been a minute.

140
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,250
Tell him don't be a stranger.

141
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,890
Pa says don't be a stranger.

142
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,050
Oh, yeah, yeah.

143
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,850
I heard him, Ma.

144
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,150
Okay, I gotta go.

145
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,670
I gotta run.

146
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Yep, okay.

147
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,070
Love you.

148
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,790
So this guy just flew into Midtown...
...and started attacking people...

149
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,570
...demanding for Superman to show up?

150
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,990
Yeah.

151
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,350
Saw that in my article.

152
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,626
I didn't actually have to make it through
your writing, Clark.

153
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,550
Knowledge is worth many sacrifices.

154
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:01,810
That isn't one of them.

155
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,390
Ha ha ha.

156
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,391
Very funny, Willis.

157
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,710
22 people in the hospital.

158
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,650
Over 20 million in property damage.

159
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,670
It does make you wonder.

160
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,350
Wonder what?

161
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,550
As great as he is, maybe Superman didn't
completely make...

162
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,210
...the ramifications of the Bravia thing.

163
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,190
Well, this guy is even from Bravia.

164
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:17,950
What do you mean?

165
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,470
His name is the Hammer of Bravia.

166
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,770
Yeah, I doubt his parents named him that,
Jimmy.

167
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,190
We have no clue what his actual goal was
here.

168
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,586
I think it's pretty obvious... ...the
bull was kicking Superman's ass.

169
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,550
He didn't completely kick Superman's ass.

170
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,826
That's a pretty very good card.

171
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,590
Show me!

172
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,330
You show me what ties there are...
...between Bravia and this... ...ever!

173
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,610
Yeah, see, Superman did say he thought the
hammer might be...

174
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,691
...faking a Bravian accent.

175
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,130
Superman said that?

176
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,666
Yeah, I interviewed him right afterwards.

177
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,690
Great guy.

178
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,470
You know, it's funny that you keep
getting...

179
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,310
...all these interviews with Superman,
Clark.

180
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,390
I don't think you're thinking anything
funny about good journalism, Lois.

181
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,590
Uh-huh.

182
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,540
The relationship between Borella...

183
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,810
...and the United States... ...has
been like... ...iron for thirty years...

184
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:04,570
...until... ...Superman
came along.

185
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,350
What you're looking at, my friends...
...is the most powerful being...

186
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,810
...on planet Earth.

187
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,350
Ultraman.

188
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,290
You created this man.

189
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,250
Check this out.

190
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,330
The Engineer.

191
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,130
The former Special Operative, whose blood
I infused...

192
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,210
...with microscopic machines called
Nanites...

193
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,150
...which she can form into...
...anything she can imagine.

194
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,570
And of course, you're familiar... ...with
my flying armored forces, the Raptors.

195
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,170
Altogether, they're an
unstoppable... ...force we call...

196
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,030
...Planet Watch.

197
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,410
More than capable of...
...containing any otherworldly threat.

198
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,210
So, you want... ...the Defense
Department to hire... ...your metahumans...

199
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,710
...to take down the Kryptonian.

200
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,310
After Superman acted with violence...

201
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:56,866
...against our Beravian allies,
I think it'd be worth considering.

202
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,170
Big Blue stopped the war.

203
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,450
Naive, matey, but well-intentioned.

204
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,010
Oh, I don't know the intentions... ...of
an unattended fire hose, General Flagg.

205
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,430
I just do what I can...
...not to be splashed.

206
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:08,431
Mr. Luther.

207
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,230
The disarming Director Crowley.

208
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,190
The country of Arabia has purchased
over...

209
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:16,870
...$80 billion worth of arms from
Luther Corp... ...in the past two years.

210
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,410
And?

211
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,150
And no one would profit more from a
war... ...with Arabia, John, more than you.

212
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,790
A cynic might say that having Superman out
of the way...

213
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,130
...might not be bad for business.

214
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,910
Well, what's particularly bad for business
is dying.

215
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,090
And I have a distinct feeling that's where
we're all headed...

216
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,830
...with the Kryptonian running wild.

217
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:35,050
So we're going to lock up all metahumans
now?

218
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,070
The other metahumans aren't going off
half-cock... ...interfering in foreign affairs.

219
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,690
They don't have, and I have proof of
this...

220
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,090
...a hidden headquarters in Antarctica...

221
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,610
...that violates 12 international
treaties... ...and they aren't aliens.

222
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,230
Shouldn't all that be more than enough
reason... ...for Planet Watch to at least...

223
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,950
...bring the Kryptonian in for
questioning?

224
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,110
Admittedly, I'm not comfortable...

225
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,810
...with a being from another planet...

226
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,070
...but the optics...
...Superman is popular.

227
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,530
Less so every day, according to chatter
online.

228
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,490
Not to mention the potential
risk... ...of failing to contain him.

229
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,230
I assure you, secretary, we can contain
him.

230
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,550
Yeah, they got this stuff.

231
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,586
What's this Kryptonite stuff called?

232
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,910
It's called Kryptonite.

233
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,170
Well, it kills him, right?

234
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,610
As far as we can ascertain, there's none
left on the planet.

235
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,310
I'd have a workaround for that as well.

236
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:29,530
Well, it doesn't matter, Lux... ...because
without solid proof of malicious intent...

237
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,430
...it's not going to work.

238
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,120
What are you doing here?

239
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Three months ago, we had our first date.

240
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,840
And so, to celebrate, I am
making you... ...your favorite.

241
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,640
Breakfast for dinner.

242
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
That's your favorite.

243
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,680
You love breakfast.

244
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,340
Yeah, from breakfast, you love it for
dinner.

245
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,720
What?

246
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,820
It's very funny today.

247
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,520
What?

248
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:47,720
It's hilarious, the little back and forth
we had going.

249
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:50,120
You giving me guff for my article?

250
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Jimmy was eating it up.

251
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,940
I wasn't acting, Clark.

252
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,100
If you keep interviewing yourself...
...eventually people are going to figure it out.

253
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
But they will ask us.

254
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,060
Yeah, they won't fool everyone forever.

255
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,960
And ethically...

256
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,040
...these interviews are hugely
problematic.

257
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,760
I mean, you literally know the questions
in advance.

258
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,440
Okay, so why are you interviewing me?

259
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,760
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't like that.

260
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,760
Come on, Lois.

261
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:16,761
I'm media savvy.

262
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,960
I can... ...handle any
question that comes my way.

263
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,840
Are you being serious right now?

264
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Yeah.

265
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,080
You'd let me interview you as Superman.

266
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Sure.

267
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
How about that?

268
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Um...

269
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Ready?

270
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,660
Let's do it, Cronkite.

271
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Superman?

272
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Miss Lane.

273
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,220
Recently, you've come under a lot of fire.

274
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,620
I know, it's a lot of fire.

275
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,621
It's a lot.

276
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,861
Today, the Secretary of Defense said he was
going to look into your actions in Baravia.

277
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
That's funny?

278
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,600
It's not funny, funny.

279
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,220
It's just, um... I
mean, come on.

280
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:01,221
My actions?

281
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I stopped a war.

282
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,140
Maybe.

283
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,240
Uh, not maybe.

284
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:04,780
I did.

285
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,400
Okay.

286
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
How?

287
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,640
Well, Baravia invaded Jarhamhur.

288
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,880
And I showed up and told them that wasn't
right.

289
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:12,881
And?

290
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,160
And smashed some tanks and things.

291
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,900
And a couple of planes and some other
stuff.

292
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,160
There were no casualties and no
significant injuries.

293
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,800
Did you interact at all with the president
of Baravia, Basil Gurkos?

294
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
A very small amount.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,780
What's a very small amount?

296
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,860
That was between us.

297
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,960
This is all on the record.

298
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,300
Yeah, but that conversation was between
the two of us.

299
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,280
Yeah, and I would ask that question
whether or not I knew the answer to it.

300
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:41,660
Really?

301
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Really.

302
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,400
After I stopped the war, I went to see
Gurkos.

303
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Where?

304
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,760
In the capital of Luchabik at the Royal
Palace.

305
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,220
And?

306
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,820
And I took a private audience with Gurkos.

307
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,280
How?

308
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,841
I flew him out to the
desert and I... And?

309
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,720
And I placed him against a cactus.

310
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,580
A cactus.

311
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
So torture?

312
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,900
No, not torture.

313
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
It's spikes.

314
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,000
We're, like, not even that big.

315
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
What did you say?

316
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,837
I told him that if he ever
messes with Jarhanfur

317
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,040
again, he'll have to
personally answer to me.

318
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,120
What did you mean by that?

319
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,780
That if such events occurred, we would
have a more serious discussion.

320
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,280
That's all.

321
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,060
More serious than tearing up his back on a
cactus?

322
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,500
Gurkos was going to kill people.

323
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,676
You seem to keep forgetting that.

324
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,600
In effect, you illegally entered a
country, inserting yourself in the middle

325
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,660
of an incredibly heated geopolitical
situation.

326
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,020
One second.

327
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:35,520
Siding with a nation, Jarhanfur, which
historically has not been a friend to anyone.

328
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Jarhanfur has changed.

329
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,020
Against a nation that's
technically our ally and

330
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:40,540
then threatened to
murder their head of state.

331
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,239
First of all, whether or not
Jarhanfur is an imperfect

332
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,100
country does not give another
nation the right to speak.

333
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,423
Yeah, but the Beravian
government maintains they're

334
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:49,760
freeing the Jarhanfurians
from a tyrannical regime.

335
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,660
Yes, but you know that's very silly.

336
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,220
I do?

337
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,660
The Beravian government of all people is
saying this?

338
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,240
Come on.

339
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,280
This is on the record, Superman.

340
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:58,700
No, no.

341
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,060
Now, see, now you're being dishonest,
Lois.

342
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:02,620
No, I'm being dishonest.

343
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,480
Wait.

344
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:04,880
Stop.

345
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,328
You're being dishonest
because you know as well as I do

346
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,260
that the Beravian government
is not well-intentioned.

347
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,120
I think that's almost certainly the case,
but do I know that?

348
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
No, I don't.

349
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,820
Can we go on now?

350
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Yeah, fine.

351
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,800
Do you think this is going well?

352
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
Do I think this is going well?

353
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,640
I think I'm doing a good job.

354
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:28,641
Superman,

355
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,700
did you consult with the president before
entering Beravian airspace?

356
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,660
No.

357
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
The Secretary of Defense?

358
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,140
Or any U.S.

359
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,021
official before you took matters
into your own hands and decided

360
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,740
unilaterally how to handle this
extremely delicate situation?

361
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,160
His goons were going to kill people.

362
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,380
Yes, but the results of you seemingly
acting as a representative of the United

363
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:51,160
States... I wasn't representing
anybody, except me.

364
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,761
I wasn't representing anybody,
except me.

365
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,112
...than a war that lasted
between 12 and 24 hours and

366
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:59,720
was just replacing one
tyrannical regime with another.

367
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,060
Is that really how you feel?

368
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm not the one being interviewed,
Superman, but I question it.

369
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,578
Yeah, I would question
myself in the same situation

370
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:12,060
and hold off the beat and
consider the consequences.

371
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,880
People were going to die!

372
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,520
Okay, I'd like to change the subject.

373
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
If I could.

374
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
Okay.

375
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,820
You've gotten a lot of heat on social
media lately.

376
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
I don't read that stuff.

377
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,120
Superman doesn't have time for selfies.

378
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Third person?

379
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,816
You're referring to yourself in third
person now?

380
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,477
No, it's just a thing
I came up with that I

381
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:41,980
thought I'd try to work
into the next interview.

382
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,440
This is on the record, Superman.

383
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,320
Okay, well, not the part where I said
that.

384
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,260
Yes, that part.

385
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:47,640
Well, that part was an aside.

386
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,540
That was off the record.

387
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,520
You have to say off the record beforehand,
not after.

388
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:53,140
Why are you being like this?

389
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,780
Fine, I won't write that you
spend your spare time trying

390
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,200
to think up soundbites,
which are terrible, by the way.

391
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,420
Social media.

392
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,421
Yes.

393
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,380
As you may know, or maybe you don't, since
you claim not to read any of that stuff.

394
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,280
Very seldomly.

395
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
Maybe sometimes people catch you reading
it and become very upset.

396
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,060
Okay, well, you can't use that.

397
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,360
People on social media are suspicious
because you are an alien, yes?

398
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Yes.

399
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,920
I've been very honest about that from the
beginning.

400
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,580
I come from a planet called Krypton.

401
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,220
Okay.

402
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,860
Which is gone now, by the way.

403
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,100
Destroyed.

404
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:28,060
Along with all of my history, my parents.

405
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
They send me here as a baby to save my
life.

406
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,540
Here where?

407
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,460
I'm not going to say that.

408
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,900
You know I'm not going to say that.

409
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
Okay.

410
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,200
What do you know about these biological
parents of yours?

411
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,337
Just that they send me
here to serve humanity

412
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:50,561
and to help the world
to be a better place.

413
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
They said that?

414
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
They did.

415
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,900
They sent a message along with me.

416
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,680
That message is why I do what I do.

417
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,320
I cherish it more than anything.

418
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,293
Because you understand now
there are an awful lot of people

419
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:10,380
out there maintaining you're
here for more nefarious purposes.

420
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,980
Hashtag super spy, hashtag super shit.

421
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:13,900
Super shit?

422
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,580
Come on, Lois.

423
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,220
You know that one specifically irritates
me.

424
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
This is on the record, Clark.

425
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
I didn't make it up.

426
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:21,540
It's what people on the internet are
saying.

427
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
I'm going to go.

428
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,900
Really?

429
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Yeah.

430
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,020
Come on, Clark.

431
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:27,021
Don't do this.

432
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm not doing anything.

433
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:28,640
No?

434
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,620
No, that's not you?

435
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,820
Packing up your shit and walking out of an
interview?

436
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm not walking out of an interview.

437
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:33,780
I'm just late.

438
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:35,936
This is what you do every time you're
faced with conflict.

439
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,500
You get mad.

440
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,000
You pout.

441
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:37,580
I'm not mad.

442
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,340
You pretend like nothing's wrong.

443
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Nothing is wrong.

444
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,500
Look, I gave you a nice long interview.

445
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,720
Longer than I ever gave myself,
by the way.

446
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,460
Oh, you can tie in your imaginary
interviews with yourself?

447
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,640
That's a thing you can do?

448
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,900
You got a lot of good stuff.

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,300
Some stuff you can't use.

450
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,760
I am well aware.

451
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,460
I knew this would never work.

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What does that mean?

453
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Lois?

454
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,820
What does that mean?

455
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,300
Nothing.

456
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,340
I just... told you I was
in a good relationship.

457
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
He was right ahead.

458
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,080
But how are we going to gain access?

459
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,520
No, he and the little face.

460
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,210
No.

461
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,760
This is what we came for.

462
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,064
Hopefully there's something
out here we can use to

463
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,120
convince the general Superman
requires immediate action.

464
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,020
I can't stand better humans, but he's so
much worse.

465
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Superman.

466
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
He's not a man.

467
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
He's an it.

468
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,329
A thing with a cocky grin and
a stupid outfit that somehow

469
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,040
becomes the focal point of
the entire world's conversation.

470
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,080
Nothing's felt right since he showed up.

471
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I know, Lex.

472
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,380
I've sacrificed my own humanity to help
get rid of it.

473
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Can you get in?

474
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,830
It might take a while.

475
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,750
What if the Kryptonian shows up?

476
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,830
Don't worry.

477
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,530
I'm creating a distraction.

478
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
What?

479
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,660
This message.

480
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,600
From his parents.

481
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,440
It's damaged but there's more.

482
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,120
It's... I can make
over the rest.

483
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,500
What are you doing?

484
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,540
What are you doing?

485
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,740
What are you doing?

486
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
What are you doing?

487
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,280
Are you drunk?

488
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
Here I am in New York...

489
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,320
And you will write in here.

490
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,180
Got it!

491
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Hurry up!

492
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,540
He's an awfully small distraction.

493
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
Better get him, baby.

494
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,760
Deep, slow breaths, ma'am.

495
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
You're gonna be fine.

496
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
It's just so cheap.

497
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,580
It's so obnoxious.

498
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
You know what I mean?

499
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,560
You can afford thousand dollar concert
tickets for your twenty-year-old company.

500
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,740
The Justice Gang has arrived on the scene.

501
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,960
That's Green Lantern, Hawk Girl,
and Mr. Terrific.

502
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,100
They're funded by the Lord Tech
Corporation.

503
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,300
Get her!

504
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,340
What's the skinny?

505
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,100
It's high, it's tough, but it's off
balance.

506
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,936
I've been trying to figure out a way to
get it out if you're alive.

507
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,680
Get it someplace where we can study it.

508
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,420
Oh, come on, man.

509
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,380
What?

510
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:02,500
No point in telling us!

511
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,800
My knee!

512
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:20,760
God!

513
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,860
Help!

514
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,820
I'm being shot another in the face!

515
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Good for you, Apple!

516
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,940
You're getting bleeped to death!

517
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,290
Gosh, there's got to be a better way to do
this.

518
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,360
How's it going with that guy you were
seeing?

519
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,060
You were saying you weren't sure about
him?

520
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,820
Yeah, he's a little strange.

521
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Whoo!

522
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,760
Had you stakes all round, huh?

523
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,726
I was hoping we could
capture it and take it to an

524
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:19,000
intergalactic zoo, or at least
euthanize it less painfully.

525
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,180
Come on, bro, don't be such a wuss.

526
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,240
Hey!

527
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,900
There's another day in the life of the
Justice Day!

528
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Another day?

529
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,200
It's just a working day!

530
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,996
It's very well proven to be permanent,
though.

531
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,840
Probably not!

532
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,320
Good chance, though, I'm saying.

533
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:31,880
You okay?

534
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,540
Everybody okay?

535
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,440
Just like to say thank you on behalf of
Lord Tech Industries for the opportunity!

536
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
Why is nobody clapping?

537
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,150
This has to be BS.

538
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,966
Well, it couldn't be mistaken.

539
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,510
Oh, no.

540
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,590
Well, that sounds very disturbing,
Max.

541
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,830
Twenty-eight of the world's top linguists
have confirmed the translation,

542
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,495
and thirty of the top
forensic computer techs

543
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:07,010
have confirmed the
validity of the footage itself.

544
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,570
Any chance that they're mistaken?

545
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,890
Unfortunately, no.

546
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,390
You have the footage?

547
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:12,930
Yes.

548
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,290
Let's take a look.

549
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,430
Hey, Caradell.

550
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,110
Yeah?

551
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:18,170
We love you more than heaven, our son.

552
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:23,810
We love you more than land, our beloved
homes, to be gone forever.

553
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,070
But hope vitalizes our hearts,
and that hope is you, Calen.

554
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,446
We have searched the
universe for a home where you

555
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:36,450
can do the most good
and live out Krypton's truth.

556
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,270
That place is Earth.

557
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,670
I don't get it.

558
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,671
What's bad about that?

559
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,090
The people there are simple and profoundly
confused.

560
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,450
Weak of mind and spirit and body.

561
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,090
Lord over the planet is the last son of
Krypton.

562
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,730
Dispatch of anyone unable or unwilling to
serve you, Calen.

563
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,496
Take as many wives as you
can, so your genes and Krypton's

564
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:10,610
might and legacy will
live on in this new frontier.

565
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,970
And as you do us proud, our beloved son,
rule without mercy.

566
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,519
What about all the
kind acts Superman has

567
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,390
performed over the years,
saving countless lives?

568
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:31,910
No, he's grooming us, lulling us into
complacency so he can dominate without

569
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:37,571
resistance, forging a path for his
super-powered descendants to rule the Earth.

570
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,330
I will not accept that.

571
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,290
Will you?

572
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,270
You see what I'm saying?

573
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,630
I...

574
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,630
I'm scared.

575
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,070
I will admit that I am scared.

576
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:00,770
Because who knows how large his secret
harem is already.

577
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,360
Dude, you got a secret harem?

578
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,020
No, of course I don't have a harem.

579
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:39,100
If any of that message is even remotely
true, then you are exactly the kind of

580
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,896
alien threat I was
commandeered by the Green

581
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,380
Lantern Corps to project
this planet against me.

582
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Back off, Guy.

583
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,800
Make a move, Big Blue.

584
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,740
Guy, relax.

585
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,520
Was the message real or not?

586
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,200
The first half is real.

587
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,089
The second half was
damaged and it's tripped

588
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:02,300
from Krypton to Earth,
so it's got to be docked.

589
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:03,301
No way, Clark.

590
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,400
I know this computer forensics guys.

591
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,060
They're not gonna say it's legit.

592
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,920
Unless they are sure.

593
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,220
I'm so sorry, man.

594
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,440
But there's no way that message is fake.

595
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,800
Where'd they get the footage, though?

596
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,570
Are you considering bringing Superman in
for questioning?

597
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,430
We're talking with the president and we
are reviewing our options now.

598
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,850
Now, I'm sure we're gonna have to go
inside.

599
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,030
And if you did, point it out.

600
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,310
You buying this?

601
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:41,150
I don't put anything past Luther,
Rick.

602
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,850
But the message is authentic.

603
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,090
If the Kryptonian is a danger,
we have to act.

604
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,650
I was a big Superman fan.

605
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,270
I supported him all the time all my life
and stuff, but now?

606
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,630
I mean, I hope he brought it in.

607
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:53,870
I don't care.

608
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,190
You're supposed to get out.

609
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,530
Where is the internet?

610
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,610
Don't call me Chief.

611
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,050
I'm gonna do my job.

612
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:05,750
It's no wonder the Kryptonians interfere
with Boravia's interests.

613
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,830
Boravia wants to save
the people of Jahanpour

614
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:14,791
and Superman wants
to keep them in state.

615
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:25,930
As though, from what I hear, he finds
Boravia women the most physically

616
00:42:25,931 --> 00:42:31,310
attractive and wants to add them to his
secret air.

617
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,190
Thank you!

618
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,790
That could have gone better, Mr.
President.

619
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,450
You were so comfortable and dynamic.

620
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,390
Excellent.

621
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,670
The real Mellenzo is here.

622
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,830
Very comfortable.

623
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,730
Very comfortable.

624
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,990
Bravo, bravo.

625
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,150
Come on, run.

626
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,650
Leave me alone.

627
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,220
Max!

628
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,000
I will just celebrate until the alien is
off the board.

629
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,900
Oh, here.

630
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,900
Brought you a doughnut from Doe's Holes.

631
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,740
New shop in Park Ridge, at home place.

632
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,360
It's a fake message.

633
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,440
A stroke of genius.

634
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,320
It's not fake.

635
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,020
He is here to kill us.

636
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,240
I knew it.

637
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,440
We have Superman's fortress.

638
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,660
I hope to get the knowledge to help
destroy him.

639
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,540
Little did I know, his own parents would
be providing him.

640
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,320
Oh, my boy.

641
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:58,780
Right?

642
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,440
Yeah.

643
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,980
I'm thinking of opening one in my half of
Jahanpour.

644
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,380
Four.

645
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,680
Four.

646
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,300
What happened?

647
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,600
I tried to protect Superman.

648
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,660
How did Lucifer get in here?

649
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,120
It's keyed into my DNA.

650
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,680
Must protect Superman.

651
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,380
Four.

652
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,020
I'm sorry for Greg.

653
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,660
Crypto?

654
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Crypto?

655
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:05,020
Well, yeah, that's
gonna be... Stop him!

656
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,000
It's fine, brother.

657
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,680
Superman, we finally meet.

658
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,560
Would you like a coffee?

659
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,660
Where's the dog?

660
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:10,860
Dog?

661
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,780
The dog, loser!

662
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,620
You took the dog!

663
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,460
That's right, you get all of this.

664
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,461
Dad!

665
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,800
Where's the dog?

666
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,820
I have no clue what you're talking about.

667
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:29,930
He's just a dog.

668
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,950
I don't know what dog you're talking
about.

669
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
What did you say?

670
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,330
I didn't say anything.

671
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,730
You heard what he said!

672
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:40,850
You heard him!

673
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:41,550
He took him!

674
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:47,350
I mean, it seems to me that the only rabid
animal around here is Superman.

675
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,970
Ever since the discovery of the Kryptonian's
master plan, he's gone off the deep end.

676
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,790
Thoughts, Chris?

677
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,670
Can't say I'm surprised, Cleavis.

678
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,310
It's guys like this, they always got a
whole bunch of dark, ugly secrets.

679
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,810
What do you mean, guys like this?

680
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,590
This is better than everybody else.

681
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,170
Makes us declarations against killing
people unless it's absolutely necessary.

682
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,790
Really, dude?

683
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,284
It kind of sounds like
you're trying to make

684
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:12,270
the guys who are a
little more edgy than you.

685
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,770
Like jerks, you know what I mean?

686
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:19,430
A lot of these guys, these heroes from the
magazines are obsessed with me.

687
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,430
Because I'm more jacked than they are.

688
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,150
They know they're more edgy.

689
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,970
You have a dog?

690
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,090
No, not really.

691
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:32,550
It's more of a foster situation.

692
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
Coco.

693
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,200
You were out there helping them?

694
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,160
Oh, no, that's just some dimensional imp.

695
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,020
They've got that handled, I was looking
for the dog.

696
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,700
You okay?

697
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,800
The footage is not what it looks like,
Lois.

698
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Okay.

699
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,077
The ship my parents sent
me in was damaged in transit,

700
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:19,521
so I only ever heard the
first part of the message.

701
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,100
And I believed I knew how it ended.

702
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,880
That my parents had sent me here to serve
the people of Earth and to be a good man.

703
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,340
I'm not here to rule over anybody,
Lois.

704
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,860
I never thought you were.

705
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,140
Even for a moment, Clark.

706
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:48,490
Oh, that's really good.

707
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm sorry before.

708
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,540
We do.

709
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,580
But we're bound to though.

710
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,500
We're so different.

711
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,920
I was just some punk rock kid from Baker
Line and you're Superman.

712
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,260
I'm punk rock.

713
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,700
You are not punk rock.

714
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,300
I like the Stranglefellows and the POVs
and the Mighty Crabjoys.

715
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,860
Those are pop radio bands.

716
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They're not punk rock.

717
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,220
The Mighty Crabjoys suck.

718
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,660
Okay, well, a lot of people love them.

719
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,720
My point is I question everything.

720
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
And everyone.

721
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:33,280
You trust everyone and think everyone
you've ever met is, like, beautiful.

722
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,430
Maybe that's the real punk rock.

723
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,480
Lois, what did you mean when you said that
you knew this would never work?

724
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,660
I don't know.

725
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
I gotta go.

726
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,080
The DOJ has a warrant out for my arrest,
so I'm gonna turn myself in.

727
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:11,081
Wait, what?

728
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,040
Why?

729
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,580
Maybe they'll take me wherever they took
the dog.

730
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,016
I don't know how else to find him.

731
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,040
It's a dog.

732
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,640
Yeah, he's not even a very good one,
but he's out there alone.

733
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,880
And he's probably scared.

734
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,160
I probably should have told him that a
long time ago.

735
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Is that necessary?

736
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,940
I'm coming in on my own accord.

737
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,880
No one read me my rights.

738
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,400
Of course the side of those rights don't
apply to extraterrestrial organisms.

739
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,781
Therefore, at this point, Superman,
you don't have any rights to read.

740
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,360
The government is very well aware of the
potential limitations detaining you.

741
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,060
So we've outsourced your confinement and
your interrogation of Planet Watch.

742
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,280
Planet Watch.

743
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,440
I'm sorry about this.

744
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,660
Twice in two days.

745
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
What a pleasure.

746
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,460
Luther.

747
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,620
Your obsession with me is getting a little
creepy.

748
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,640
Don't worry.

749
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,500
Tall, dark, and martian isn't my type.

750
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,360
Kryptonian.

751
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
Yes, in depth.

752
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
Where are we?

753
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,780
A pocket universe.

754
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,660
I replicated the Big Bang with a Luther
Corp.

755
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,080
mega collider tearing a tiny hole between
the two universal fabrics.

756
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:13,001
I'm able to access it from multiple dimensional
portals I've set up around the globe.

757
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,488
Rex, the metahuman known
as the Element Man, has

758
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:19,381
been called into service
for a specific purpose.

759
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:26,441
He can metamorphose into any known substance,
even substances foreign to this planet.

760
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
Like...

761
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Kryptonite.

762
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,760
We're in board.

763
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,518
Superman's been out
of commission less than

764
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,841
a day and already
Bravia's pulling this crap?

765
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:48,800
Right?

766
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:49,460
What?

767
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,740
Sorry, I'm trying to figure out how Lex
Luthor's connected to all this.

768
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,840
How's that a mystery?

769
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,660
Luthor Corp sells arms to Bravia.

770
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,780
Bravia goes to war, Luthor sells more arms
and gets richer than ever.

771
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:00,840
Nope.

772
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:01,720
No?

773
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,140
Uh-uh.

774
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,400
I have a connection at Boda Bank.

775
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,640
Boda handles the transactions between
Luthor Corp and Bravia.

776
00:53:08,865 --> 00:53:11,529
Yes, Luthor Corp sold them
approximately $80 billion worth

777
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:16,500
of arms, but for those arms,
Bravia paid only $1.625 billion.

778
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,300
So Luthor gave them arms for free?

779
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,140
For what?

780
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,600
That's the $78,375,000,000 question.

781
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,636
Have you found out where they're holding
Superman?

782
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,020
No one in the government will say.

783
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,706
Luthor seems to be
working to disable Superman

784
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,460
just so he can't stop
the invasion of Jarnport.

785
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,900
Why?

786
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,780
That's way too much sugar, Moe's.

787
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:38,000
I party like a rock star, choir boy.

788
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,260
Still can't hide the taste of petroleum.

789
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,940
God.

790
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,820
Lex is holding Superman in a pocket
universe.

791
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,660
A what?

792
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,536
I don't know what a pocket universe is,
neither does my source.

793
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,624
They don't know
anything about anything,

794
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,860
really, but for sure he's
in a pocket universe.

795
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,020
Who's your source?

796
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,680
I can't say, but you owe me.

797
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,140
Big time.

798
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,200
Like... I can't even tell you how big.

799
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,400
I love you, Jimmy Olsen.

800
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,020
I love you.

801
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,300
Love you.

802
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:43,170
This is my monkey bots here, farming
outrage 24-7.

803
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,970
Trashing you online.

804
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,490
Hashtags.

805
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,870
Well, how do you contain a superdog?

806
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,490
You beam super squirrels into its brain.

807
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:15,230
We'll learn what we can, and we'll put the
varmint down.

808
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,660
Most cells are rented out
to governments who want to

809
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:31,400
keep their incarcerations
of political agitators private.

810
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,340
Others have more personal transgressions.

811
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,820
Florent wrote a blog about me.

812
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,160
There are a few things I hate more than
petty ex-girlfriends.

813
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,800
You wouldn't be telling me any of this.

814
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:45,082
Do you have any questions we ever plan on
letting you out?

815
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
No.

816
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,220
You'd be terminated already if it was up
to me.

817
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,360
But first, the government has some
questions they want answered.

818
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,120
Rex, look who it is.

819
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,401
If we keep our guests in check, old Joseph
certainly wouldn't want it any other way.

820
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,600
I'll be back tomorrow to get the answers
we need.

821
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:39,830
Hi.

822
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,710
Hey.

823
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:43,302
Oh, sorry we had to meet
here, but Lex has always

824
00:56:43,303 --> 00:56:45,750
asked us in traffic cameras
so he knows where I am.

825
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,066
I really don't understand why you're
staying in that relationship.

826
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,486
There's even a point
to tell me about all his

827
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:51,971
ex-girlfriends he had in
prison in his pocket universe.

828
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:52,410
What?

829
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,570
Rex?

830
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:54,690
How's your mom?

831
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,290
My mom?

832
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:56,910
Oh, I love her so much.

833
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,230
I think of her as my mom even more than my
own mother.

834
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:03,330
Oh, she feels the same way from the one
time that you guys met?

835
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,970
So hey, okay.

836
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,550
There seems to be some sort of connection
between Boravia and your boyfriend.

837
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,550
I'm not clear on what... what's wrong.

838
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,570
What's wrong?

839
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,730
I thought you wanted to see me,
Jimmy.

840
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,750
I do, but Eve, how could I even really see
you with Lex still in the picture?

841
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,810
You're just trying to get information out
of me.

842
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,026
I swear to God that's not it.

843
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,627
I just know that if I could
get some real dirt on him

844
00:57:26,628 --> 00:57:28,771
then maybe the two of us
could... Be together again?

845
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,250
Yeah.

846
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,690
But you said my toes look like someone
spilled shrimp cocktail on the floor.

847
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,910
You have unconventional toes.

848
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:42,590
Who cares?

849
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,410
There's other parts of you that people
would find very attractive.

850
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,650
Lex tortured a dog the other day.

851
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,390
Jesus Christ!

852
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,110
I know.

853
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,170
I have to go.

854
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,490
Eve, please see what you can find out.

855
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:56,250
Okay.

856
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:56,910
Yes!

857
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,370
Yes!

858
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,060
I'm putting him in my pocket.

859
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,610
Joseph, he's your son?

860
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,290
Don't talk to me.

861
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:20,650
Please.

862
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:26,870
I think I'll fill it over and get him if
it's... if you'd stop with the crypto.

863
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:28,230
There's no way out of here, okay?

864
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:29,850
There's always a way.

865
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:30,890
I said don't talk to me!

866
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,830
Don't talk to me!

867
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,860
Dude, where's the cleaner?

868
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,960
On the counter where it always is.

869
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,780
He's in your group, right?

870
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,720
The... what's it called again?

871
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,980
The Justice Gang!

872
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:56,480
No.

873
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,500
We're not called that.

874
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,020
Your name is Mr. Terrific.

875
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,796
You don't get a vote with a name like
that.

876
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,680
I also voted against it.

877
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,160
Yes.

878
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,520
And as leader, I get tiebreaker.

879
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,340
No, Superman is not officially a member.

880
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,616
Because you don't want him to vote.

881
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,460
You know which way that would go.

882
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,120
Shut up.

883
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:10,620
He's kidding.

884
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,640
So how do you even know Superman anyway?

885
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,460
I just do.

886
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,340
So you know about the hypno glasses?

887
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,320
Now she does.

888
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,760
Well, I'm not saying who he is just that
he wears hypno glasses.

889
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,360
They make his face terrific.

890
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,080
How do they work?

891
00:59:25,081 --> 00:59:27,286
They make his face
look different in your brain

892
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:29,500
when he wears them so
that you know who he is?

893
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:29,800
Yes.

894
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,020
I know this, first of all.

895
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,419
But second of all,
you really shouldn't be

896
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,321
telling me this in case
I don't know who he is.

897
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:36,600
So you know he's Clark Kent?

898
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,060
Oh my god.

899
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,620
Why does he trust everyone?

900
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,520
He doesn't.

901
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,040
Just us because we are also of the cloth.

902
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,540
Of the cloth?

903
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,320
What are we gonna do?

904
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,540
About what?

905
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:51,880
Superman!

906
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:53,460
He's your friend!

907
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:55,620
Some friend came here to rule over me?

908
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,800
It would be difficult to find him.

909
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,120
I put nanobot GPS trackers into Superman's
bloodstream.

910
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,560
You can see where his trail ends abruptly
right here at Fort Kramer, a dormant

911
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,660
military post across the river about ten
miles down.

912
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,300
Even if he was dead, those trackers would
still be there.

913
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,114
So all this leads me to
believe, as your article

914
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:15,401
surmised, he really
is a pocket universe.

915
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,100
You put nanobot GPS trackers in your
friend's bloodstream?

916
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,340
Oh, I do that to everybody.

917
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:22,340
So, okay, come on.

918
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,600
Let's go to Fort Kramer then.

919
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,660
The four of us and find out what's going
on.

920
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,420
And then do what?

921
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Save him.

922
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,520
You want to bring a federally incarcerated
prisoner out of jail?

923
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,513
Look, I think this is
being done to keep him

924
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:37,420
from interfering with
the Boravian invasion.

925
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,300
No, you look.

926
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,840
I'm a Green Lantern lady.

927
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,640
That means I took a vow not to get
involved in politics.

928
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,740
Oh, that's part of the vow?

929
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,960
It's implied.

930
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,240
Yeah.

931
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,460
An implied vow?

932
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,080
Every time there's something he doesn't
want to do, he says it's part of some vow.

933
01:00:49,081 --> 01:00:51,341
Oh, I swear to God, I'm
two seconds away from

934
01:00:51,342 --> 01:00:54,421
forming a giant hammer
and beating a boat today.

935
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,280
If soup's here to take over the world,
I don't, probably not.

936
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,060
But the risk is just not where the beef
between the U.S.

937
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,500
government and the Justice can.

938
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,940
Not our name makes it sound like cowboys,
but I agree with the rest.

939
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,200
See, you're just going to let your friend
rot in the pocket universe.

940
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,960
That haircut should be against your vows.

941
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,220
That what?

942
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,100
That what should be what?

943
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,200
I'll have you know, 348 chicks say
otherwise.

944
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,310
Hey.

945
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:43,590
What?

946
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,450
I'm not saying we're going to save him,
but...

947
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,747
I think we can at least
check out what's going on

948
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:50,170
with your boyfriend
with this foreign criminal.

949
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,710
He's not.

950
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:53,690
We're just seeing each other.

951
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,050
Thanks.

952
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:57,230
You want me to drive?

953
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,370
We'll take my ride.

954
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,260
You have a flying saucer, but you couldn't
get a faster garage door?

955
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,660
I haven't worked on that yet.

956
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,800
I'm not even sure how I feel, honestly.

957
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,480
What?

958
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,020
That Clark.

959
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,720
He's not my boyfriend.

960
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,180
We've actually just been seeing each other
for a couple months now.

961
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:39,216
Yeah, maybe just to be clear.

962
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,620
I'm not into people's emotions.

963
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,940
Yeah, no, totally.

964
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,940
I'm just thinking out loud.

965
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,660
I was going to break up with him,
actually.

966
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:50,660
We had this huge fight, and he told me he
loved me, and it just didn't...

967
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,190
QandA time, alien!

968
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,740
Today we have a special guest.

969
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,860
And the smell of his piss as we flew
across the desert.

970
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,540
That is a lie!

971
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,480
No, not the seal.

972
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,940
He's just here as an observer.

973
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:25,640
Not me.

974
01:03:25,641 --> 01:03:27,180
Now, the U.S.

975
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,380
government has a few questions for you.

976
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,000
Luther, I barely know him.

977
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,560
He gave me food one time.

978
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,460
Who are you working with here on Earth?

979
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,620
I'm not working with anyone, Luther.

980
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,020
Tell him nothing, Superman.

981
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,580
I have no family or nothing.

982
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,540
Luther, don't do this.

983
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,860
You eating my food was a great honor,
Superman.

984
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,600
Got lucky on that one.

985
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,360
No, Luther, don't do this.

986
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:52,840
Please.

987
01:03:52,841 --> 01:03:55,020
Let's try another question, don't we,
Superman?

988
01:03:55,021 --> 01:03:58,240
Who raised you as a child?

989
01:03:58,241 --> 01:03:59,680
I believe in you, Superman.

990
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,360
Don't tell him nothing!

991
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,360
I didn't imagine that would go so quickly.

992
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Mr. Hanson.

993
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,861
I'll be back later with someone else
you've chatted with and I'll kill them too.

994
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,880
Maybe that reporter you always do
interviews with.

995
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,400
Maybe I'll kill Clark Kent next.

996
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,630
No, no, no, no.

997
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,000
We're freaking out, Tom!

998
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,460
Get back.

999
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,130
here or I'm gonna leave!

1000
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:28,950
Hey!

1001
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,791
Um... That's his path.

1002
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,330
DNA trail leads to that tent.

1003
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,730
Isn't that one of those Justice guys?

1004
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,970
It's just a smart one.

1005
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:37,830
Hey!

1006
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,870
You heard the man!

1007
01:05:39,871 --> 01:05:43,570
I am giving you one last chance to talk!

1008
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,230
I was just about to say the same to you.

1009
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,710
Come on!

1010
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:31,210
Come on, come on, come on!

1011
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,990
Holy shit.

1012
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,230
Unbelievable.

1013
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,990
That jackass did create a pocket universe.

1014
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,130
And that's his path.

1015
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,050
For creating a pocket universe,
if you are just one picometer up,

1016
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,830
you will have a black hole where Earth
used to be.

1017
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:20,893
And every time you
enter or exit, you risk

1018
01:07:20,894 --> 01:07:23,731
tearing the hole into
the fabric of reality.

1019
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,110
You're kidding.

1020
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,110
It's the type of reckless science looks
Luther specializes in.

1021
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:29,730
What are they doing?

1022
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:31,690
They're trying to hack you.

1023
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:34,190
So I guess you decided to help.

1024
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,590
Only because of the piss off Green
Lantern.

1025
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,350
Thanks.

1026
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:51,090
You just killed that poor guy.

1027
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,810
She said you.

1028
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,280
can get to my son, right?

1029
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,480
Why are you still gross looking?

1030
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,360
I don't know.

1031
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,120
That must be the sun.

1032
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,160
What sun?

1033
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,280
There's no sun here.

1034
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,340
That's the problem.

1035
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,400
For your deal.

1036
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,140
I get my powers from the yellow sun.

1037
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,400
Just give me a second.

1038
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,620
Hell yeah.

1039
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,080
We're in.

1040
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,450
Where am I going to get the gear to rappel
into a pocket universe?

1041
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:49,170
I don't know.

1042
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,290
Maybe it comes out of your circles or
something.

1043
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:52,090
Circles?

1044
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:52,630
What?

1045
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:53,410
T spheres.

1046
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:54,210
Okay.

1047
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:55,090
They're three dimensional.

1048
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,110
Circles reflect.

1049
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,450
Sorry.

1050
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,730
Unbelievable.

1051
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,410
This place is filthy with black hole
vortexes.

1052
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:06,090
And that anti-proton river will tear us
apart in seconds.

1053
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,690
We cannot go in ourselves.

1054
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:10,370
Copy.

1055
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,450
I can't make a sun.

1056
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:13,910
I know.

1057
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,170
I can only make something kind of like a
sun.

1058
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,930
What?

1059
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:19,610
All right.

1060
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,990
Okay.

1061
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,510
We've got hydrogen.

1062
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:24,410
And we've got helium.

1063
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,390
And we've got helium.

1064
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,250
What are you doing?

1065
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,910
Hey!

1066
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:29,450
Hey!

1067
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:30,490
No, no, stop!

1068
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,110
Enough!

1069
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,690
You're going to get all of us in trouble!

1070
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:33,370
What are you doing?

1071
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:33,910
Hey!

1072
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,850
He's doing something in here!

1073
01:10:35,851 --> 01:10:36,851
George!

1074
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:37,430
George!

1075
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,570
He's doing something!

1076
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,370
You are not going to take me to the right
for this, officer!

1077
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,710
Go straight behind the bar!

1078
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,370
We're not getting a benefit from you!

1079
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,820
You've saved him.

1080
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,820
I can't carry him when I change forms.

1081
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,680
What do you see?

1082
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,060
Did you find him?

1083
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Oh, my God!

1084
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,840
What is that?

1085
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,280
The portal's been open too long.

1086
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,260
I can't stand here much longer.

1087
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:07,680
Oh, no.

1088
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,740
Like, shit.

1089
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,820
I'm fine.

1090
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,880
I think we need to get to those portals up
there.

1091
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:12,881
Uh, right.

1092
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,100
How do we... port them?

1093
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,980
I don't know, but we'll figure it out.

1094
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,660
Joey!

1095
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,740
What.

1096
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,410
are you going to do, squash us?

1097
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,590
Yes?

1098
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,850
With... with our white swanic acid?

1099
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,440
Hot damn!

1100
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,000
What?

1101
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,740
This is Swann Dahl.

1102
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,060
Uh-oh.

1103
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,400
What?

1104
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,420
Come on!

1105
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:41,421
Come on!

1106
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:22,170
You're so weird.

1107
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,070
Do you have them?

1108
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:26,810
Them?

1109
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,710
Superman, a mean dog, and a capable,
weird baby, and a squiggle man.

1110
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:32,930
What?

1111
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,450
Terrific?

1112
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:36,790
Follow me!

1113
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,040
Up!

1114
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,080
Quick, go!

1115
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:42,700
Go!

1116
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,080
Leave it!

1117
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,180
Are you kidding me?

1118
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,260
Don't touch it!

1119
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,300
Oh, my gosh.

1120
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,260
Thank you.

1121
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,750
Hey.

1122
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,410
Hey.

1123
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,080
You came to get me?

1124
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,680
Yeah.

1125
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,370
There's more people being held prisoner in
there.

1126
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:35,910
We gotta go get them.

1127
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:38,430
Not through here, you can't.

1128
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,330
Not with you like this.

1129
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:43,250
Claude, what the...
It's kryptonite poison.

1130
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,650
He'll hear, but it'll take a day or two.

1131
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,270
Get him someplace safe.

1132
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:49,930
Take the T-craft.

1133
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,230
The controls are easy and intuitive.

1134
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,610
I need to stay back here and make sure the
portal is secure.

1135
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,110
No.

1136
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,491
Dog, I really need
you to... Come on.

1137
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:28,920
Okay.

1138
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,460
Me too.

1139
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,640
Eve!

1140
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,360
Get out of here, you idiot!

1141
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,460
Move!

1142
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,180
How the hell could he have gotten free?

1143
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,500
We need the T-craft.

1144
01:18:11,501 --> 01:18:13,980
We need to find him.

1145
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:19,120
Eve?

1146
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,120
Oh, I'm so done, Jimmy.

1147
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:26,620
Oh, um... I have everything
you need to ruin Lex forever.

1148
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:27,360
What?

1149
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:27,880
Where?

1150
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,340
Over here.

1151
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,300
How dare he?

1152
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,590
But.

1153
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,160
if I send you this, Jimmy...

1154
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,600
Uh-huh.

1155
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:56,790
You have to promise me we get to hang.

1156
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:57,791
This weekend.

1157
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,150
Just the two of us.

1158
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,320
Uh... Okay?

1159
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,600
Yeah, okay.

1160
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,700
Uh-huh.

1161
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,260
How, uh...

1162
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,800
How long?

1163
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:17,780
A weekend.

1164
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,840
A weekend?

1165
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:20,300
Oh, my God, Jeannie.

1166
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,960
I'm sorry this is such a major imposition
on your life.

1167
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,000
No, it's not an imposition.

1168
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,941
I... I can tell you
don't really think so.

1169
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.

1170
01:19:31,061 --> 01:19:32,061
Eve?

1171
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,900
Come on.

1172
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,660
Um, I'm Martha.

1173
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,780
This is John.

1174
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,120
I'm Lois.

1175
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,820
Lois.

1176
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Here, son.

1177
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,940
Um... They sent
me here to roll over.

1178
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,480
They sent me here to kill people.

1179
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,680
Clark!

1180
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,100
That ain't... that ain't...

1181
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,620
Is our war gonna be okay?

1182
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,640
Yes.

1183
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:55,740
Mr. Triffix says yes.

1184
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,560
Don't mind him, Lois.

1185
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,980
He's just a big old mush.

1186
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,060
Especially when it comes to Clark.

1187
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,280
This girl is obsessed with you?

1188
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:24,820
Uh-huh.

1189
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:26,560
How do you do it, Jimmy?

1190
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,460
Look, I didn't even want to bother you,
but you told me to call with anything I

1191
01:21:29,461 --> 01:21:32,196
got, so... Yeah, but I thought you
said she disappeared off the line.

1192
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:32,740
I don't know.

1193
01:21:32,741 --> 01:21:34,220
She might have dropped her phone in the
toilet.

1194
01:21:34,221 --> 01:21:35,520
She does not have a line.

1195
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,220
Well, I'm not really sure that sexy
selfies are...

1196
01:21:51,255 --> 01:21:52,960
Your hot ex is a genius.

1197
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:53,920
Hot?

1198
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,140
We have to talk to Perry.

1199
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,900
I'll be there as soon as I can,
okay?

1200
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,420
Send them sexy selfies behind the back of
Lex Luthor.

1201
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,200
She has to be the biggest idiot in the
world.

1202
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,240
Lex, we just told you the portal was
destroyed!

1203
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,240
The dimensional aperture is still there.

1204
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:13,360
We can open remotely
so... It is not safe!

1205
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,640
We can close the aperture later by
inputting the coordinates, correct?

1206
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,580
Theoretically.

1207
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:18,860
Great!

1208
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,840
If we can't find him, we'll need to draw
him out.

1209
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,320
Look, Lex!

1210
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,760
That Luthor has a dimensional reach into
the surrounding area!

1211
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,720
If it's something you think I don't
know...

1212
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,340
That shit happened!

1213
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,960
Oh, you don't say!

1214
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,240
Can you stop it?

1215
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,800
Can I stop it?

1216
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,880
This is why you don't create a damn hot
universe.

1217
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,520
There, Superman won't be able to ignore
that.

1218
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,100
Now we know where he'll be next.

1219
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,450
Thought she was out of here.

1220
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,450
Never seen you sleep that long.

1221
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:20,630
Last week, me, Mom, Hector, and them,
we took a drive to beer keys and burritos.

1222
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,250
Down in West.

1223
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:26,310
Like the one that used to be out by that
old blue bar.

1224
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,250
Do you remember that?

1225
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,710
Mm-hmm.

1226
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,450
Rita's still just as good.

1227
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,600
That blue ass, he seems nice.

1228
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,380
His name's Lois.

1229
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:43,420
Hmm?

1230
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,880
His name's Lois.

1231
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,980
Yeah, she's nice.

1232
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,700
But you don't seem quite yourself.

1233
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,069
You know, well, the
message that my parents sent

1234
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:58,421
with me, I had never heard
in the second half before.

1235
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:03,614
Well, I'd say what you wanted
that message to me says a

1236
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:08,820
whole lot more about you than
what anyone meant for it to me.

1237
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,400
You don't understand.

1238
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm not who I thought I was.

1239
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,870
They sent me here to hurt people.

1240
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,790
Parents aren't for telling their children
who they're supposed to be.

1241
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:36,490
We are here to give y'all, to help you
make fools of yourselves all on your own.

1242
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:48,190
Your choices, Clarke.

1243
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,150
Your actions.

1244
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:04,510
To some extent, I couldn't be.

1245
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,520
more proud of you.

1246
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,080
Oh, mush.

1247
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,480
Clarke, get something on the box you might
want to see.

1248
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,080
And over in Eastern Europe, Arabian troops
gather at the border seemingly mere

1249
01:26:32,081 --> 01:26:35,040
minutes away from invading Jarmuor once
again.

1250
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:40,140
Now, nearby villagers are willing and
ready to defend their country despite the

1251
01:26:40,141 --> 01:26:44,180
exponentially superior firepower of the
well-trained Arabian military.

1252
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,582
The villagers cling
onto what little hope they

1253
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,661
have left as they're
surrounded by the villagers.

1254
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,420
Superman!

1255
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,480
I cleaned your boots.

1256
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:52,000
I'll go get them for you.

1257
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,740
Superman, we need you here in Metropolis,
now.

1258
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:58,220
I have to get to Boravia, terrific.

1259
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,965
There won't be a
Boravia, or a Metropolis,

1260
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:03,141
or a planet Earth if
you don't get here soon.

1261
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,200
This rift is about to tear it to the city.

1262
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,560
I can't stop it.

1263
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,040
I need your help.

1264
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:15,000
All Metropolis citizens, this is a
mandatory evacuation.

1265
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,560
Repeat, this is a mandatory evacuation.

1266
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,300
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1267
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,980
We're all going to be scared.

1268
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,180
Come on, just put her on.

1269
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:45,700
Please, let her in.

1270
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,340
Can you put Persephone on the phone?

1271
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,020
Yes, she will care.

1272
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,780
Can't she know the sound of your voice?

1273
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:53,400
So I've been able to connect with our
contact at Bodavane.

1274
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,920
Luther's been selling arms to Gurgos for
pennies on the dollar for years.

1275
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,460
Why, you ask?

1276
01:28:58,720 --> 01:28:59,720
How do you ask why?

1277
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,300
He did it in exchange for half of Jarvan's
gold.

1278
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:04,320
You too.

1279
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,860
At first I thought Eve was just sending me
selfies, but in the background of the

1280
01:29:08,861 --> 01:29:12,920
shots were maps, contracts, all kinds of
documents, chronicling a bravious

1281
01:29:12,921 --> 01:29:16,340
agreement to cede half of the country to
Lex Luthor once the invasion is complete.

1282
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,300
He wants to make himself king.

1283
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,880
King.

1284
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:20,980
King.

1285
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,680
Should we really still be standing here?

1286
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,680
Lewis, you got that flying saucer deal up
on the roof?

1287
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:28,860
Grant, group, come on.

1288
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:29,840
Grab the board, Jimmy.

1289
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,040
How many does it hold?

1290
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,180
Five or six.

1291
01:29:32,181 --> 01:29:32,520
Six.

1292
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:33,640
Okay.

1293
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,160
Come on, you two.

1294
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,500
Why the hell would Lex want half a dozen?

1295
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,320
His cultish acolytes believe he's going to
create a technologically advanced utopia.

1296
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:42,900
Utopia?

1297
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,600
That's a profit factor as well.

1298
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,940
And the petroleum deposits alone are worth
multiples of his investment.

1299
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:50,028
Whatever his motives
are, he don't want to do

1300
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:52,100
everything he could to
ruin Superman's reputation.

1301
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,480
Eve's photos show he was behind the whole
hammer of bravias scam.

1302
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,720
And all the bots stirring up anti-Superman
sentiment online.

1303
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,362
Mr. Terrific believes
Luthor is also behind

1304
01:30:01,363 --> 01:30:03,880
the spreading rift between
universes out there.

1305
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,027
All of it seems to be geared
towards stopping Superman

1306
01:30:06,028 --> 01:30:08,201
from standing in the way of
the bravian invasion, Chief.

1307
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,840
Call me Perry, kid.

1308
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,720
Post the story.

1309
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:11,980
Fast.

1310
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,100
Lock the door, kid.

1311
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,020
Why don't I have a seat?

1312
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,080
Jimmy, will you transcribe?

1313
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,081
Uh-huh.

1314
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:37,580
The Daily Planet has obtained exclusive
information proving that billionaire Lex

1315
01:30:37,581 --> 01:30:40,740
Luthor is in league with the bravian
dictator of a sealed word code.

1316
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,680
Clark, are you close?

1317
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:53,840
It's about to hit Metropolis, and my codes
are not shutting down.

1318
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,640
Shit!

1319
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,360
So slow it down.

1320
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,076
I can, unless I can put the code in.

1321
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,500
Just hold on a minute, then.

1322
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:56,830
There's a code to close the rift,
but it's too complicated to hack.

1323
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:58,870
Luthor will have the code at Luthor Court.

1324
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:02,757
Just give me a minute, I'll
get crypto and we'll go-You

1325
01:33:02,758 --> 01:33:07,080
brought that-I didn't want
him killing my parents' cows.

1326
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:20,810
The nanites are suppressing his optic
nerve.

1327
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:23,090
Sight and extra vision should be
completely muted.

1328
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,270
Mouth breach.

1329
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,840
Yeah?

1330
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:33,980
There I am.

1331
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,440
We won't sleep peacefully!

1332
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,460
The whole street won't be flooded!

1333
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,640
I'll kill you all!

1334
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:28,450
Who's in friction to get the nanites out?

1335
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:30,310
Doesn't matter if he gets them off his
face.

1336
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:31,990
The nanites are still in his lungs.

1337
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:34,150
Engineer Ultraman, keep up!

1338
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:35,790
We're trying!

1339
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:41,010
Maintain LOS.

1340
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:41,230
Yes!

1341
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:41,930
No shit, now!

1342
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,030
Hurry!

1343
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:17,290
Entering the hole.

1344
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:19,390
Infrared, please.

1345
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:02,070
Her heart's still beating, but she's
unconscious.

1346
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:03,690
Calling the raptors.

1347
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,000
Cloning you was relatively simple.

1348
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,478
All it took was combing
the aftermath of your

1349
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:40,600
battles until I located
a strand of your hair.

1350
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,540
That's how you got into the fortress?

1351
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,100
You had my V.N.A.?

1352
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:49,440
Yes, but as is often the case with
cloning, the match was imperfect.

1353
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:53,420
The team might be even stupider than you,
if that's possible.

1354
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,280
But easier to control.

1355
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:56,281
3S!

1356
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,700
22K!

1357
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,340
31K!

1358
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:04,960

1359
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,000
5B!

1360
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,380
5B!

1361
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,640
6K!

1362
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
9K!

1363
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,580
My brain will always win!

1364
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,260
Brain beats brawn!

1365
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:23,620
No matter what you do to me, Luther,
your plans in Boravia won't work.

1366
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,900
Oh, man!

1367
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,420
Why's that?

1368
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,400
Because I called in some friends.

1369
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,160
Mr. Luther?

1370
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,060
There is an anomaly at the border.

1371
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,500
I'm not like Superman.

1372
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:03,070
It's perfect.

1373
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:03,710
Posture's good.

1374
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,990
Honest.

1375
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:14,950
I think you overestimate the importance of
Jarhead more to be Superman.

1376
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:16,870
That was just a bonus.

1377
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:22,590
I'm not killing you so the Boravian
military conflict can proceed.

1378
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:31,790
I created the Boravian military conflict
so I'd have an excuse to kill you!

1379
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:35,063
Once you involve
yourself by you, I can easily

1380
01:43:35,064 --> 01:43:37,851
get our government
support in qualifying you.

1381
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:39,350
Why?

1382
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:42,300
Because you're destroying us!

1383
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:43,990
Timeline 13B!

1384
01:44:08,830 --> 01:44:09,270
Obviously.

1385
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:10,370
No shit.

1386
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:11,730
I'm not dim.

1387
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:15,050
I'm aware Envy consumes my every waking
moment.

1388
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:16,850
13L.

1389
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:20,230
I know!

1390
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:23,890
When they mention Galileo or Einstein or
one of these other twits in the same

1391
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:27,010
breath as me, I feel a tide of vomit burn
the back of my throat.

1392
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:28,526
But at least Galileo did something.

1393
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,450
He wasn't summoned.

1394
01:44:29,451 --> 01:44:35,150
Don't be the new ship catapulted onto this
planet just to have the world fawn over

1395
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:40,630
him because his strength illuminates how
weak we all really are.

1396
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:47,950
So my Envy is a calling.

1397
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:56,611
It is the sole hope for humanity because
it is what has driven me to annihilate you.

1398
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:11,110
What are you.

1399
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:17,690
smirking at, you idiot?

1400
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,550
Brain beats prawn.

1401
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:24,630
Sorry, Tom.

1402
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,540
You watching through those?

1403
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,440
Tell them what to do.

1404
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,760
Crypto!

1405
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,260
Get the toy!

1406
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:06,960
13L!

1407
01:46:06,961 --> 01:46:08,180
Come on, stupid dog!

1408
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:09,980
Crypto is down!

1409
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:25,260
Crypto is still down!

1410
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,250
Crypto is down!

1411
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:28,990
We have to get to Luther to stop the rift!

1412
01:48:28,991 --> 01:48:30,070
I'm not messing around.

1413
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,290
I'm doing important stuff.

1414
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,040
It's going to reach a bigger line in a
minute.

1415
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,080
There are people there.

1416
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,950
They chose him!

1417
01:48:58,230 --> 01:48:59,310
Let them die!

1418
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:02,950
We'll close it from the bunker before it
gets to a city I care about.

1419
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:06,630
Open the port!

1420
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:12,370
Not bad.

1421
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:13,730
Let's go.

1422
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:15,970
Save me first, people!

1423
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:35,690
I'm a goddamn Mr. Terrific.

1424
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:39,870
You piece of shit alien!

1425
01:49:40,930 --> 01:49:43,490
That is where you've always been wrong
about me, Lex.

1426
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:45,990
I'm as human as anyone.

1427
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,830
I love, I get scared.

1428
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:52,790
I wake up every morning and despite not
knowing what to do, I put one foot in

1429
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:55,730
front of the other and I try to make the
best choices I can.

1430
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:57,430
I screw up all the time.

1431
01:49:57,890 --> 01:49:59,590
But that is being human.

1432
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:02,450
And that's my greatest strength.

1433
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:10,030
And someday, I hope, for the sake of the
world, you understand that it's yours too.

1434
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:12,490
Oh, that's beautiful.

1435
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:15,830
But none of this matters, you patronizing
clown.

1436
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:19,490
The government gave me the authority to
kill you.

1437
01:50:19,491 --> 01:50:22,490
If not today, then...

1438
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:43,830
Dude.

1439
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,180
Got it.

1440
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
Lex!

1441
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:20,680
What?!

1442
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:21,681
Well, this just in.

1443
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,060
An absolute bombshell from the daily
planet.

1444
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:28,600
Billionaire Lex Luthor aligning himself
with a foreign entity, believe it or not.

1445
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:32,926
Luthor has been giving them billions and
billions of dollars worth of free weapons.

1446
01:51:32,927 --> 01:51:32,920
..

1447
01:51:32,921 --> 01:51:35,959
Lex Luthor has been working
covertly with Vasil Gherkos and

1448
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:40,000
the Boravian government to
overthrow the country of Jarhan IV.

1449
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:44,400
Luthor has been giving them... We
had Luthor on this show many times.

1450
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,980
Little did we know, he was a traitor.

1451
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:48,840
The foolishness of that.

1452
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:53,301
The one thing
conservatives and liberals can

1453
01:51:53,302 --> 01:51:55,800
finally agree on is
that Lex Luthor sucks.

1454
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:59,000
The whole world turned against Superman.

1455
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,760
And we all owe him an enormous apology.

1456
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:07,040
He is, of course, the hero we always
thought he was.

1457
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:12,450
I'm glad you're not concerned about the
Medicians, Rick.

1458
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:15,430
Because now they're the ones making the
rules.

1459
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:43,150
Get his ball back to Bel-Reed!

1460
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,270
Ms. Lane.

1461
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:41,910
I thought I might give you an interview.

1462
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:45,490
I could fill you in on all the behind the
scenes.

1463
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:46,890
Sure.

1464
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:51,691
I think that would be... Great.

1465
01:54:54,415 --> 01:54:56,490
How about over here, for an interview?

1466
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,740
How long have they been hooking up?

1467
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,540
About three months, I think.

1468
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,816
Got this place cleaned up pretty good.

1469
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,240
I love that.

1470
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,000
Cleaned yourself up pretty good,
too.

1471
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,320
You think so?

1472
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:16,980
Yeah.

1473
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,800
I think it gives you character.

1474
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,380
Maybe one day you'll give me a name.

1475
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:24,701
Well... Forza name?

1476
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,020
So is Gary.

1477
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,100
Sir, I think your cousin has returned.

1478
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:36,840
Yeah.

1479
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:39,300
What the hell, dude?

1480
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,700
Why did you move the door?

1481
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,300
I didn't move the door.

1482
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:44,660
Where is my dog?

1483
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:54,650
Okay, well, this is why he has behavioral
issues.

1484
01:56:54,651 --> 01:56:55,950
No boundaries.

1485
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:00,790
Sounds healthy, isn't it?

1486
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:14,010
Thanks for watching, you bitch!

1487
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,620
She likes to go and party on other
planets.

1488
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:21,540
Planets with red suns.

1489
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:25,840
Because of her, metabolism can't get drunk
on a planet with a yellow sun.

1490
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:30,820
If I had any emotional capacity whatsoever,
I'd be concerned about her partying.

1491
01:57:30,821 --> 01:57:31,860
Yeah.

1492
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:35,140
Superman, would you like to see the
footage of your parents?

1493
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,020
He finds it soothing.

1494
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:38,420
Oh!

1495
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,040
Yeah, Gary.

1496
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,400
That'd be nice.

1497
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:57,730
No!

1498
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,810
No!

1499
01:58:18,910 --> 01:58:19,910
No!

1500
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,520
I am your father.
