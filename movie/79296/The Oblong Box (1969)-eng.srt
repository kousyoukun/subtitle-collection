1
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,474
Let go of me!

2
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,419
Let go of me!

3
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,551
Edward!

4
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,959
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,993
Edward!

6
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,990
Edward.

7
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,560
Go back!

8
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,762
Edward, no!

9
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,303
You leave me no choice. Ruddock.

10
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,773
- Edward!
- Don´t do it!

11
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,510
Edward! Please, control yourself.

12
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,616
Down here, on the bed!

13
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,113
Stop!

14
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,727
Get them.

15
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,571
- L´m asking you.
- I don´t know.

16
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,410
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

17
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,968
I don´t know what you and him are up to,
but you´ve got to get him out of here.

18
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,341
- You´re being paid.
- And paid well.

19
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,644
Barely well enough.
If the police come, what´s the answer?

20
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,342
You´ve nothing to fear, Hackett.

21
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,252
You´re running a lodging house
for drunken thieves and whores.

22
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,846
It´s that filthy stench.
What´s he doing in there?

23
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,291
- That´s what I want to know.
- That´s enough! About your business!

24
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,727
Anyway, he´ll be gone soon enough.

25
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,631
The sooner the better, if you ask me.

26
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,956
- It´s not ready to be seen as yet.
- But it will be by tonight?

27
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,193
Yes. Have you brought the money?

28
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,063
- Gold?
- Guineas.

29
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,273
But not till your work is done.

30
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,145
When it is,
you can take this back to Africa with you...

31
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,575
...on the same boat that brought you here.

32
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,709
You´ll be a rich man, N´Galo.

33
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,282
That´s what you want.

34
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,225
Do you think it will work?

35
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,354
When he takes this,
he will sleep as if dead.

36
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,393
Look...

37
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,830
...even if we do get Sir Edward here...

38
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,067
...can he really help him?

39
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,969
I have seen what witchcraft can do.
Believe me, Norton.

40
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,011
You have seen what another man
of my powers has done already.

41
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,579
Have you not?

42
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,005
Yes.

43
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,583
We have knowledge of things
you know nothing of.

44
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,370
L´ve been thinking it over, Julian.

45
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:44,040
And l´ve decided that I want to
get married at sea on an open boat.

46
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,043
Yes.

47
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,986
In a brilliant scarlet dress to amuse
all the sailors and shock my father.

48
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,855
What? L´m sorry Elizabeth.
I was miles away.

49
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,459
So I noticed.

50
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,996
Back in Africa?

51
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,923
Why do you think that?

52
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,160
I would have thought it was obvious.

53
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,033
Since you´ve been home
you´re a totally different person.

54
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,572
- No, that´s nonsense.
- No, it isn´t.

55
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,707
Look at you.

56
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,244
Always brooding, heavy-spirited.

57
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,674
Half the time you seem to forget
you´re with me and we´re going to get...

58
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,444
Elizabeth, dear, I am sorry, truly.

59
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,088
What happened out there?

60
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,281
What´s on your mind all the time?
Please tell me.

61
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,089
No. It´s not worth your worrying about.

62
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,664
When we´re married, Julian,
I want to share your life.

63
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,200
Don´t let´s start out with secrets, please.
Let me start sharing now.

64
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,604
I may have things on my mind,
but that doesn´t mean that l´ve changed.

65
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,013
Then prove it.

66
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,924
I didn´t really mean that.

67
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,355
I meant...

68
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,553
...l´d like to see you smiling
the way you used to smile.

69
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,758
There!

70
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,801
Yes, it´s your usual good report, Trench.

71
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,775
- Thorough and precise.
- L´m more than pleased to be back.

72
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,941
- Africa is a heathen place, and no mistake.
- Yes.

73
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,316
Thank you.

74
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,749
Yes, we´ve had
a distasteful time of it here, too.

75
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,560
Properly handled, your African plantation
could keep you living well...

76
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,595
...to the end of your God-given days.

77
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,326
You and your brother.
We mustn´t forget Sir Edward, must we?

78
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,460
Sir Edward wouldn´t eat
any of his dinner, sir.

79
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,798
Thank you, Ruddock, l´ll try later.

80
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,472
How is Sir Edward now?

81
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,208
How did you expect him to be? Better?

82
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,004
I had hoped more normal.

83
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,081
Yes, he did seem to be more normal...

84
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,812
...so we took off the chains.

85
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,785
But the madness only overcame him again.

86
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,217
He tried to break away, to escape.

87
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,661
Ever since then
he seems to have grown steadily worse.

88
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,323
Every man wants to be free.

89
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,561
How can he be free,
looking the way he does?

90
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,202
Don´t you understand
his mind is going, too?

91
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,865
Sometimes that sickness strikes him
with such ferocity...

92
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,609
...he´s as dangerous as an insane beast.

93
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,946
Perhaps an asylum?

94
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,808
No.

95
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,384
We mustn´t even think about that.

96
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,719
I couldn´t bear the thought of my brother
screaming his life away...

97
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:44,091
...in Bedlam with the rest
of those unfortunate creatures.

98
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,725
And surgery is out of the question?

99
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,699
Do you think those carrion doctors
could put his face together again?

100
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,632
Do you think they could even
lay hands on him...

101
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,307
...without wanting to experiment? No.

102
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,042
L´d like to see him.

103
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,913
I don´t allow anyone to see him but myself.

104
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,646
- He´s much too dangerous.
- L´m not afraid.

105
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,156
He seemed so pleased
to see me the last time.

106
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,489
Yes, he did seem to be better
for a while after you saw him.

107
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,698
Very well, you may go up.

108
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,833
But please,
don´t let him see you´re shocked...

109
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,440
...by how much worse he has become.

110
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,336
And don´t get too close.

111
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,973
Remember, if the madness
comes over him again...

112
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,244
...your only protection
are the chains on his feet.

113
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,942
- Thank you, l´ll remember.
- Ruddock.

114
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,152
Take Mr. Trench to see Sir Edward.

115
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,806
- L´d keep my distance, sir.
- It´ll be all right, Ruddock.

116
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,946
Sir Edward?

117
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,046
Sir Edward. It´s me, Trench.

118
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,350
There isn´t much time.

119
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,487
I just want you to know
that l´ve come back from Africa.

120
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,835
- Have you done what I asked?
- Yes.

121
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,495
When will it be?

122
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,633
In two days. It´ll be ready.

123
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,244
You will be well rewarded. Unless you fail.

124
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,984
I must get out of here, Trench.
L´m counting on you. Before it´s too late.

125
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,266
It´s as I feared. You´ve upset him.

126
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,379
L´m afraid I can´t allow anyone
to see him again ever.

127
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,813
Good night.

128
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,090
Look!

129
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,395
What happened?

130
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,596
Body snatchers, Master Julian.

131
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,467
They got away.

132
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,905
The doctors still require
their warm guinea pigs.

133
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,479
You´re not shocked?

134
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:53,241
Lt´s better that they practice their
barbarities on the dead than on the living.

135
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,549
- They pay a handsome price, I suppose.
- Of course.

136
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,119
And for some of our people,
that kind of money is the difference...

137
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,456
...between a full belly and an empty one.
- You´re not shocked?

138
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,121
I can see how important
it is for the poor souls.

139
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,867
Better than a good mark in heaven.

140
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,436
It is for God to judge, Parson, and not you.

141
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,231
It´s horrifying, Julian.

142
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,244
Far worse things
are known to man, Elizabeth.

143
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,984
L´m going to put it all out of my mind.
The only thing to think about is us.

144
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,687
- Are we still getting married soon?
- Sooner.

145
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,187
Because Father may succeed
in driving me off to Italy, away from you.

146
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,761
- But I thought we had his blessing.
- That was before.

147
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,886
Before?

148
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,331
Before you returned
from the dark continent.

149
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,925
Before you dismissed most of the servants.

150
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,396
Before the town started to talk.

151
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,142
You mean they´re talking about me?
About the house?

152
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,144
Don´t you see what a hermit
you´re becoming? Of course they talk.

153
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,608
Wild tales of demons
and ghosties with rattling chains.

154
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,852
But you don´t believe
any of that nonsense, do you?

155
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,189
There´s nothing to believe, is there?

156
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,856
- What do you think?
- I think they´re all madmen, fools.

157
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,354
Good.

158
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,310
For the master.

159
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,004
- From Mistress Elizabeth, Master.
- Thank you, Ruddock.

160
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,100
Have you taken up Sir Edward´s dinner yet?

161
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,645
No, sir, l´ll take it up right away.

162
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,256
"Dearest Julian, I am no longer able to fight
my father's wishes to send me to Italy."

163
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,019
"He is disturbed by your strange behavior..."

164
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,789
"...and wants to be sure
that I do not make a mistake."

165
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,423
"You must know that it is not my wish
to leave you and end our betrothal."

166
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,991
Master Julian!

167
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,738
Sir! Lt´s Sir Edward!

168
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,873
What is it, Ruddock?

169
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,972
You´d better come, Sir.

170
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,675
Edward, why did they have to take you?

171
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,547
Can your soul ever forgive mine?

172
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,784
Ruddock...

173
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,156
...bring Trench to me.
And no one else is to know.

174
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,950
Very well, Sir.

175
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,305
There´s Trench now.

176
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,389
- My brother Edward has died.
- L´m so sorry to hear that.

177
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,693
There´s no need for sorrow.

178
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,863
In his case oblivion was a merciful release.

179
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,740
- When is he going to be buried?
- As soon as you´ve found another body.

180
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,740
I don´t understand.

181
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,680
It´s been so long since there was
a funeral in this family, Trench.

182
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,411
You´ve forgotten.

183
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,081
The Markhams go to their grave
with a sense of occasion.

184
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,629
The villagers must pay their respects.
We must lie in state for the world to see.

185
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,463
But we wouldn´t want the world to see
what Edward was really like.

186
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,465
So you want another body
for the villagers to look at?

187
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,404
Correct. Edward is already in his coffin.

188
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:30,176
Once the town has gaped at the proxy
corpse, then we can bury the real one.

189
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,977
I won´t be involved.

190
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,986
You´ve been involved with this family
most of your life, Trench.

191
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,023
Do you realize the penalty
for body snatching is hanging?

192
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,422
- It´s the same penalty as for forgery.
- What?

193
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,925
I said forgery.

194
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,823
With these papers you have managed...

195
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:50,425
...to extract 1,000 guineas
from our plantations, is that not so?

196
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,662
L´m a lawyer, not a businessman.

197
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,000
You´re a forger and an embezzler...

198
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,000
...and now you´re going to become
a body snatcher.

199
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,841
Not willingly, Julian.

200
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,414
They say the deeper you get,
the easier it becomes.

201
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,888
- How long have you known about this?
- L´ve suspected for some time.

202
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,089
But now I know.

203
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,060
What are you going to do?

204
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,521
L´m going to give you
another 1,000 guineas...

205
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,356
...or turn you over to the authorities.

206
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,534
Very well, Sir Julian.

207
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,166
Your brother shall have the traditional,
dignified funeral.

208
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,904
Just give me enough time
to find a body for him...

209
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,104
...that won´t disgrace your noble line.

210
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,283
Will you join me in a brandy?

211
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,683
Thank you.

212
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,442
Have you brought the money?

213
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,769
- Well?
- I was sent for.

214
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,312
- It happened?
- Yes.

215
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,417
When do we let ourselves into the house
to rescue Sir Edward?

216
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,950
We don´t. Not now.

217
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,315
Why not?

218
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,749
Because, my dear Mark,
Sir Edward is already nailed in a coffin.

219
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:22,951
What?

220
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,625
And securely locked behind a door
to which we do not have a key.

221
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,164
I don´t understand.

222
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,394
There are, however,
still opportunities for making money.

223
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,527
How?

224
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,633
Julian doesn´t want anyone to see
his brother looking the way he does now.

225
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,266
He wants another body
to show the townspeople.

226
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,973
That´s madness!

227
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,015
Madness or not, we are going to
provide him with another body.

228
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,718
We haven´t got to do anything.
At least, I haven´t.

229
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,414
My God, Trench, have you forgotten
Sir Edward alive in that coffin?

230
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,218
Control yourself, Mark.

231
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,226
L´ve already told you,
there´s nothing we can do about that.

232
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,627
Julian is offering 1,000 guineas
for a dead body.

233
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,027
And that´s what we´re going to do,
give him one.

234
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,702
So how do we get it? Answer me that.

235
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:16,080
N´Galo, I feel, can help us further.

236
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,059
- Good. You know what to do?
- Aye, Doctor.

237
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,830
They put it in, we take it out.
As fast as that.

238
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,964
What about the last one you promised me?

239
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:47,204
We had a bit of trouble, but don´t
worry yourself, this one will be warmer.

240
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,773
L´ve come to pay you.

241
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,280
Inside.

242
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,221
Yes. Here we are.

243
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,095
Well, go on.

244
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,636
Help yourself.

245
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,297
I think you´ll find it´s all there.

246
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,365
L´ll get Mr. Hackett. I will.

247
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,540
- Mr. Hackett.
- L´m afraid he´s busy.

248
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,443
- Not too busy to see me, love.
- Good evening, madam.

249
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,608
- Yes?
- Mr. Hackett, l´m afraid, is not too well.

250
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:10,745
- What is it this time?
- I fear he´s had a little too much to drink.

251
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,718
L´m not surprised.

252
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,151
But I can assure you
that he´ll be up presently.

253
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,821
Ruddock, tell your master
that Samuel Trench wishes to see him.

254
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,593
On a matter of the greatest importance.

255
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,674
This is Mark Norton.

256
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,875
- I told you to do it alone.
- I couldn´t do it alone.

257
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,882
Hadn´t you better get your prize inside?

258
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,628
Yes. Ruddock.

259
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,054
Since our return from Africa,
as you know...

260
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,124
...my brother has been forced
to live in seclusion...

261
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,629
...the victim of a tropical disease.

262
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:05,262
However, in his will, he has not
forgotten the village of his youth.

263
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,297
There is a substantial donation
to the church...

264
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,306
...and generous bequest to the poor.

265
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:21,050
Our Father which art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

266
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,133
- 1,000 guineas and this.
- Blood money.

267
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,566
Hardly. The man was already dead.

268
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,572
- Tell me, what really did happen in Africa?
- What do you mean?

269
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,005
- Nothing. Only it is curious, isn´t it?
- What is?

270
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:51,137
That no one´s ever heard what Sir Edward
did to deserve such a terrible punishment.

271
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,782
Retribution.

272
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,487
That´s just what l´ve come to think it was.

273
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,587
- Retribution.
- God´s vengeance.

274
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,695
You were never impressed
by the Christian myths before.

275
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,028
Sin and retribution.

276
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,364
We sinned out there in Africa, all right.

277
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,366
Plundering their land,
and we´re still stealing their wealth.

278
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,098
Though they´re too innocent to know it.

279
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,508
Yes, Edward´s fate
can only be our punishment...

280
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,479
...our kind of retribution.

281
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,511
You´re only making me more curious.

282
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,201
´...of whom may we seek
for succour, but of thee, O Lord...

283
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,034
´...who for our sins art justly displeased?

284
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,341
´Yet, O Lord God most holy,
O Lord most mighty...

285
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,072
´...O holy and most merciful Saviour...

286
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,946
´...deliver us not into...´

287
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,314
Why did you never tell me?
I would have understood.

288
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,019
I couldn´t be sure, Elizabeth.
I didn´t know how to tell you.

289
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,784
Sending that letter to you.

290
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,527
L´m so sorry. So very sorry.

291
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,788
You´re my last chance, Elizabeth,
for some peace, some happiness.

292
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:00,130
- You will stay, you will marry me?
- Of course I will, darling.

293
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,872
He has found some peace at last,
as he never could have on earth.

294
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,070
´...dear brother here departed...

295
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,114
´...we therefore commit
his body to the ground...

296
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,344
´...earth to earth...

297
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,480
´...ashes to ashes...

298
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,545
´...dust to dust.

299
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,650
´...in sure and certain hope
of Resurrection...´

300
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,852
- Poor Edward Markham.
- We´ll open the house again.

301
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,362
It´ll be like it once was.

302
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,033
We´ll let the sun stream in on a new life.

303
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,575
Help! Murder!

304
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,850
- Murder!
- Right, hold him.

305
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,768
Move yourself.

306
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,666
Come on.

307
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,106
Easy.

308
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,249
Come on.

309
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,089
Giddy-up now!

310
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,145
Move yourself, lads. Come on.

311
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,311
I thought you were
never going to get here.

312
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:32,446
These things take time and caution,
Doctor, as l´m sure you realize.

313
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,581
Yes.

314
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,892
- What have you got for me this time?
- Male. Just buried.

315
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,791
His name and where he comes from
is my business. You know that, too.

316
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,669
By the way, we´ve got something
extra special for you tonight.

317
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:51,139
- What do you mean?
- All right, bring it in. On the table.

318
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,347
Slightly damaged, l´m afraid.

319
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,793
We couldn´t take one without the other,
if you see what I mean.

320
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,093
- You murdered him.
- Well, the law might call it that.

321
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,926
We ought to call it a lucky accident.

322
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,403
Lucky for you, because you´ve got
twice the stuff for your knives and needles.

323
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:26,101
Lucky for me and the boys
in the usual way.

324
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,379
Of course, you know...

325
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,343
...you´d better never ever
so much as whisper about this, don´t you?

326
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,609
Weller!

327
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,056
You would do well to realize
that you are in this as deeply as I am.

328
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,625
Remember that.

329
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,127
It´s all in the course of science, isn´t it?

330
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,049
Why don´t we spend the honeymoon
in Africa?

331
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,184
No.

332
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,659
A long time ago, when you first met me,
you said you loved the land out there.

333
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,027
But not any more, Elizabeth.
I never want to go back there again.

334
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,697
- Why?
- L´ve seen too much...

335
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,240
...of what Africa can mean...

336
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,479
...and what we have come to mean
to Africa.

337
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,815
In fact, I...

338
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:47,742
Yes?

339
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,881
L´ve been thinking of abandoning
everything out there before it´s too late.

340
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,791
What would that mean?

341
00:39:55,926 --> 00:40:00,863
Well, it would mean that we´d still be
Sir Julian and Lady Elizabeth...

342
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,392
...but there wouldn´t be anything
to go with the title.

343
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,837
I see.

344
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,364
For years now, this family has been
nothing but an empty facade.

345
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,068
- And yet, still you´d abandon Africa?
- More than ever.

346
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,975
That´s the only way we can find peace.

347
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,822
You´ll make a splendid host, Doctor.

348
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,426
And I feel very much at home here.

349
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,728
- L´m obliged to you.
- And l´m obliged to you, Doctor.

350
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,528
Particularly as you´re going to
give me shelter.

351
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,001
Are you suggesting that I should
hide you here in this house?

352
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,336
Why should I?

353
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,743
Your body snatchers seem to have
thrown you on the murder trail last night.

354
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,212
Would you like anyone to know about that?

355
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,547
Anyway, the penalty for grave robbing
is the noose, isn´t it?

356
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,584
And happily or not,
my body´s alive enough to tell the tale.

357
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,423
Just who are you?

358
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,763
- Don´t you know whose grave they robbed?
- I do not.

359
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,727
Empty graves eventually tell their story.

360
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,667
You´re mistaken.
They show no signs of having been opened.

361
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,706
So, you´re the only one
who knows of my resurrection.

362
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,470
I couldn´t have wished for better.
L´m in your good care now, Doctor.

363
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,944
Indeed. And for how long?

364
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,177
As long as need be.

365
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,450
I must stay hidden.

366
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,557
You´re going to keep me healthy as well...

367
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,564
...until l´ve paid back
some very urgent debts.

368
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,532
Duke!

369
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,372
What have you found, Duke?

370
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,328
Come on, Duke!

371
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,599
The servants have returned.

372
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,474
Now that you´ve safely taken charge
of your remarkable cadaver...

373
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,843
What shall I say to them about you?

374
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,375
Tell them...

375
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,849
...l´m a relative, badly burned abroad...

376
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,012
...who prefers not to frighten people
with his scars.

377
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,548
Yes, I suppose that´s reasonable.

378
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:45,153
- You really are a very fortunate man.
- Why do you say that?

379
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,459
You´re looking at someone who must be
quite unique, even in your experience.

380
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,998
A man turned inside out through sorcery...

381
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,935
...by a handful of powders
and obscure drugs.

382
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,407
My mind´s been unhinged,
my face destroyed.

383
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,178
L´ve been killed and then brought
miraculously back to life.

384
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,208
I am a very remarkable creature, Doctor.

385
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,309
And you are only concerned
with what the servants will think.

386
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,718
- One has to observe the conventions.
- Be done with it, and get out!

387
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,255
Lock me in here if you wish,
and don´t worry about the servants.

388
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,657
L´ll only do my prowling by night.

389
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,822
Poor fellow. I wonder who he was?

390
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:22,916
We´ll find out.

391
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:27,327
This is Master Julian Kemp, Doctor.
He found the body.

392
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,230
- My dog did, actually.
- You uncovered a mystery, Master Kemp.

393
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:35,538
Whoever he is, he wasn´t drowned.

394
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,576
He died, it seems, from natural causes...

395
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,612
...and either fell
or was pushed into the water.

396
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,338
Thank you.

397
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,205
Thank you, Sally.

398
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,981
A beautiful girl.

399
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,485
- And what´s that supposed to mean?
- Merely a comment.

400
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,559
Perhaps you´d be good enough to tell me
how long you propose to stay here?

401
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,966
L´ve told you, Doctor.
Until I settle my debts.

402
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,964
I hope l´m not interfering with your work.

403
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,474
In fact, I intend to help you financially.

404
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,712
It must be just awful
to have your face so badly burned...

405
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,748
...that you can´t let it be seen.
L´m sorry for him.

406
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,115
- He sounds such a gentleman.
- Don´t let your sympathy go too far.

407
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,415
- Mrs. Hopkins!
- You needn´t Mrs. Hopkins me.

408
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,150
I know your dealings with the gentry,
Sally Baxter.

409
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,159
It´s not faces you´re interested in, is it girl?

410
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:09,029
Well, Mark, everything´s ready
exactly the way you asked for it.

411
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,534
A draft on the American Bank,
and the balance in gold.

412
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,081
Aren´t you going to say thank you?

413
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:32,484
Thank you, Trench, for your worthless
promises and the blood on my hands.

414
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,557
You needed money. I helped you get it.

415
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,525
You didn´t mention that getting it
meant murder!

416
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,222
You really are frightened, aren´t you?

417
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,055
Yes.

418
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:47,536
My dear Mark, if Hackett´s body is found,
there´s nothing on it to prove his identity.

419
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,902
And what about Sir Edward? Buried alive.

420
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,939
An unfortunate accident.

421
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:57,207
L´ve forgotten the entire affair and
I suggest the sooner you do, the better.

422
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,610
L´m leaving England.

423
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,711
I wish to God
l´d never set eyes on you, Trench.

424
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,387
I pray to God I never shall again.

425
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,894
I think it´s time for tea, Graves. Don´t you?

426
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,354
All right. To Dover.

427
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,056
Hey there, driver!

428
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,159
No need for knives, highwayman.

429
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,234
Not if you tell me
where the witch doctor is.

430
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,599
- Sir Edward.
- Where is he?

431
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,763
- I don´t know.
- Too late for lies now.

432
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:07,410
- I swear, I don´t know.
- Then you are useless to me.

433
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,351
Good evening, Madam.

434
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,750
It´s so nice to see the house open again.

435
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,523
Yes, a change.

436
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,469
Very interesting.

437
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,986
- Sir Julian.
- L´m so pleased you could come.

438
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,450
Charmed.

439
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,961
Baron, l´m so pleased to see you.

440
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:19,765
Sir Julian. You´ve never looked better.
Time you were married.

441
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,303
Yes, I agree.

442
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,297
- Kemp.
- Julian.

443
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,170
Lovely to see you.
L´m so pleased you could come.

444
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,144
I want you to do a portrait
of my beautiful Elizabeth one day.

445
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:37,110
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
She looks radiant tonight.

446
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,757
- What is it?
- It´s a man. A man in a crimson hood.

447
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,730
It must be a highwayman.

448
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,059
Ruddock!

449
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,728
Bring the other servants.
There´s a prowler about.

450
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,103
- Right. Out in the garden and search.
- Right.

451
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,875
No, please, everyone don´t leave.

452
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,036
Don´t leave. Believe me,
there´s nothing to worry about.

453
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,638
The servants will take care of everything.

454
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,150
I want to drink a toast.

455
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,050
To my wife!

456
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,056
Lady Markham...

457
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,760
...I see nothing but happiness
and comfort ahead.

458
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,830
More than enough for just two.

459
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,667
Please, now, let´s dance.

460
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,307
To assist you in your experiments.

461
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,180
Good night, Doctor, and sleep well.

462
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,858
- Aren´t you frightened?
- Why should I be?

463
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,894
Me, a stranger, hiding under a hood.

464
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,962
You don´t know...

465
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,681
You little slut!
You were with him last night, weren´t you?

466
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,691
- Well, what if I was?
- That man is dangerous.

467
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:33,454
That man´s in pain.
You wouldn´t feel sorry for a crippled dog.

468
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,690
- Have you seen his face?
- No.

469
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,561
But he´s burned, isn´t he?

470
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:42,300
Why should I be afraid of scars when I see
all the dead bodies that you handle?

471
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,498
It makes my skin crawl.

472
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:50,710
If that´s all that´s disturbing you,
you have nothing to worry about.

473
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,383
You´re dismissed! You can go home.

474
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:58,115
L´m sure that with your abilities
you will find suitable lodgings...

475
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,984
...and an appropriate position.

476
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,558
L´d need some money for that, Doctor.

477
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:09,492
I said, you´d have to make it worth my
while to leave such a wonderful position.

478
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,326
Otherwise the village will hear more
about your surgical research.

479
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,472
Very well.

480
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:23,134
But don´t imagine that you´re going to
indulge in a little blackmail...

481
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,578
...or breathe a word about that man.

482
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,047
What if I do?

483
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:32,081
I might find myself buying
your pretty little body one day.

484
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,653
For a guinea or two.

485
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,059
- Where is Sally?
- She´s gone.

486
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,432
Gone where?

487
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,335
Gone away.

488
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,632
Why? I wouldn´t harm her.

489
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,413
You can say what you please,
but she´s not coming back.

490
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,673
Remember this...

491
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:03,742
...you need me, and without my help
you wouldn´t last one minute.

492
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:14,359
L´ve read your reference, Sally, and I see
no reason why you shouldn´t start at once.

493
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:18,730
- Thank you, milady.
- Sally, why did you leave Dr. Neuhartt?

494
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,607
A relative came to stay.
There was no room for me.

495
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:29,674
If you do your work satisfactorily here,
I think you´ll find it a good situation.

496
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,145
- Thank you, milady.
- Come with me, Sally.

497
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,947
Pleasant-looking girl.

498
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,852
I want everything
to be perfect for you, Elizabeth.

499
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:44,825
It will be.
The house looks wonderful, Julian.

500
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,665
- There´s only one thing that frightens me.
- What´s that?

501
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,694
That room upstairs.

502
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,649
- Here, look after him.
- Thank you, sir.

503
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,915
Sir. Hello.
You doing anything tonight, sir?

504
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,184
What do you got that mask on for?

505
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,985
Hey now, get a hold of him.

506
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,962
Hey, Gov´nor.

507
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,173
L´m very sorry, gentlemen.

508
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,166
It´s perfectly all right.

509
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,708
- Perfectly all right, sir.
- Have you been to a party?

510
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:40,609
- Looks like he´s been to a fancy dress ball.
- Come in and have a drink.

511
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:44,084
- Thank you, but I really haven´t time.
- Come along with us.

512
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:48,381
- Come to Macgregor´s and have a drink.
- You´re very kind, but I must be going.

513
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,792
- Wait till you see what´s going on there.
- Come on.

514
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,391
You´re very kind, but perhaps another time.

515
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,982
See what I mean?

516
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:16,270
- Sorry, dearie.
- What´s he doing in that hood?

517
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,246
He must be very important to hide his face.

518
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,643
Or very ugly. Or both.

519
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,880
How are you tonight, dearie?

520
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,625
Isn´t that Prince what´s-his-name?
Can they let him out at night?

521
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,997
- Too proud to show your face?
- Sally?

522
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,741
My name is Heidi.

523
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,337
But for every taste we have a name.

524
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:56,678
If you want me to be Sally, I will be Sally.

525
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,683
Come with me.

526
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,805
How do you want me?

527
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,337
No, I shouldn´t be here.

528
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,611
Of course you should.

529
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,213
What´s the matter with you?
Are you frightened?

530
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,752
You can leave on your mask. I don´t mind.

531
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,894
I like you as you are.

532
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,267
That will cost you extra.

533
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,004
Give me the britches, darling.

534
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,553
And the dress. I said extra for the dress.

535
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,364
That´s my wife there, mister, understand?

536
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:06,232
If you´re the Prince of Wales, it´s gonna
cost you money to get outta here.

537
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,108
And if you are the Prince of Wales,
it´ll cost you even more.

538
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:14,576
And he has gold in his pockets
enough to blind you.

539
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,810
Has he now?
You´d better hand it over then.

540
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,523
Who the devil are you?

541
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,494
Come on, Heidi. We might have
a real treasure on our hands here.

542
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,595
Let´s see what´s behind this mask.

543
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,672
No. You won´t get out of here...

544
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,179
...until I see your face.

545
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,944
- It´s a bear!
- It´s a dancing bear.

546
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,882
- Dance!
- It is a bear!

547
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,190
Dance!

548
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,293
Yes, dance for us.

549
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,789
Dance.

550
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,532
Get off me!

551
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,136
Get him.

552
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,783
Boy! Stop!

553
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,550
Come back here!

554
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,579
Stop him, someone.

555
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,263
What´s the matter with him?

556
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,027
Here, cut it out!

557
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,361
Murder!

558
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,432
Murder!

559
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,709
Bloody murder.

560
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:16,258
- What kind of a beast did that?
- L´ve told you. It was the man...

561
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:20,426
- I know. The man in the crimson hood.
- Going downstairs?

562
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,196
Away, all of you.

563
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,770
Out of the way. Go on.

564
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:33,641
- You must know who he was.
- Well, I don´t.

565
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,445
And you didn´t want to lose
this future customer?

566
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:37,609
No.

567
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,282
You don´t think l´d set a loony
straight out of Bedlam on my lady, do you?

568
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,586
Knowing you, Harry, l´d say yes.

569
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,420
But we´ll find out, won´t we?

570
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,958
If anybody knows anything,
bring them along.

571
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,261
Very good, Mr. Hawthorne, sir.

572
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,801
You say this hooded figure had money.

573
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,338
So Heidi told me.

574
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:03,708
Which you were both going to
relieve him of?

575
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,380
No, we weren´t.

576
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,812
No. You wouldn´t do
anything like that, would you?

577
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,451
No, of course not.

578
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:15,388
- Would you say he was of the gentry?
- I don´t know. He never talked to me.

579
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:19,620
Excuse me, sir. Take a look at this.
A cloak with blood on it.

580
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,959
- Hey, that´s his cloak.
- That´s his, all right!

581
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,924
- And he was wearing this cloak?
- Yes.

582
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,069
´J. N.´

583
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,210
- I wonder.
- What?

584
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,709
If there´s anything underneath that tape.

585
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,849
´E. P. Higgs.´

586
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,182
´Tailor.´

587
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,225
´Langford.´

588
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:14,080
There we are. Now you take those
and come back to see me in two days.

589
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,720
- Good bye.
- Bye, Doctor.

590
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,090
Hope you feel better soon.

591
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,649
- Dr. Neuhartt?
- Yes?

592
01:09:57,059 --> 01:10:00,426
L´m a Crown Officer from London.
I want to speak to you.

593
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,488
Very well. Won´t you come in?

594
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,938
These are your initials, Doctor,
and this is your cloak.

595
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,448
The tailor who made it told us so.

596
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,846
Yes, they are mine.

597
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,115
Why, that´s blood.

598
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,851
Blood of a tart in London
who got her throat cut.

599
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,996
- Throat cut?
- By someone wearing that cloak.

600
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,559
I don´t understand.

601
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,000
Dr. Neuhartt,
I must ask you some questions.

602
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:43,127
Where were you last night?

603
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:47,372
I was at the house of Mr. Jenkins,
the local magistrate. I was dining there.

604
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,239
He will confirm that.

605
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:53,272
Could you possibly explain how your cloak
came to be worn in London?

606
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:57,079
Why, no, I can´t. I lost it.
I must have left it somewhere.

607
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,251
Where?

608
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:03,080
If I knew that, Mr. Hawthorne,
I wouldn´t have lost it, would I?

609
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,990
I suggest you obtain confirmation of
my presence in Langford last night...

610
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,659
...and continue your investigations
in London and take these with you.

611
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,508
- Good day to you.
- Thank you, Doctor. Good day.

612
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,705
- What did you tell them?
- I told them nothing.

613
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,045
You killed that woman, didn´t you?

614
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,149
That´s an interesting group
you have up there.

615
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,886
Thank you, Julian.

616
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:15,257
That´s a fine composition.

617
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,932
I have a great deal of work
to do on that yet.

618
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:24,637
Here is a portrait that I just finished
for Lord Wallace.

619
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,807
L´d suggest the same size
for Lady Elizabeth.

620
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,873
A different style, of course,
for her entrancing beauty.

621
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:38,681
Julian, here are some more things
I think you might be interested in.

622
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:44,418
- That´s a wonderful landscape.
- I think I can really be pleased with that.

623
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:49,791
You see this strong line coming
from left to right, right across the picture.

624
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,862
- Another line...
- Who is that a portrait of?

625
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:58,071
Lt´s just a sketch I did from memory.

626
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:00,541
From memory?

627
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,210
Yes, some unknown man
my dog found dead in the river.

628
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:10,279
Now this other strong line
coming from top...

629
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,608
- Julian?
- Yes.

630
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,247
You don´t know who it is, do you?
Quite a shock it was.

631
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,153
It just caught my eye.

632
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,954
Yes, it´s quite an interesting face.

633
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:23,395
One plummets the depths for answers.
Only the customs...

634
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,126
Would you sell it?

635
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,734
Sell it? My dear Julian,
you can have it for nothing.

636
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:33,105
- Mysteries just disturb me.
- That´s very kind of you, thank you.

637
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:37,607
Now for this forest picture,
I tried to get the feeling of the forest...

638
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,875
But l´m afraid l´m going to have
to be running along now.

639
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,684
We can work out the sittings later on.

640
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,620
Thank you so much, l´ve really enjoyed...

641
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:59,430
You and Norton threw that body
into the river. Why?

642
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,893
- That´s rubbish! Who says that?
- I do.

643
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,837
Because it´s now in the hands
of a parish magistrate.

644
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,670
There was nothing on the body
to say who it was.

645
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,940
Except that it had been viewed earlier
by the people of my village...

646
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,413
...as the body of my late brother.

647
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,048
And not only that.

648
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:21,054
The man who found it was an artist.
He made a sketch. Look.

649
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,786
Fortunately, I managed to get hold of it.

650
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,860
Why didn´t you put the body
back where it came from?

651
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,191
- Because it was too risky.
- Why?

652
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,730
Because it was. That´s why.

653
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,230
Trench...

654
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,635
...how did that man die?

655
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:40,706
- What are you so inquisitive about...
- What grave did it come from?

656
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,778
- What´s this all about?
- You heard what I said. Answer me.

657
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,403
What are you hiding?

658
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:48,779
- L´ve got enough troubles of me own!
- L´m not hiding anything, man.

659
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,478
There´s something going on
I don´t like the sound of.

660
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,112
If it´s as important as that
for you to know...

661
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:58,182
...then it´d be far more important for me
not to tell you. And l´m not going to!

662
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,922
And another thing. After this,
there´ll be no more dealings with me.

663
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,065
You´ve become far too nosy.

664
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,033
In my business,
that´s taking too much of a risk.

665
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,865
- Weller...
- Good day, Doctor.

666
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,616
After Edward was free,
what happened then?

667
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,044
Nothing.

668
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:27,117
You locked him up, you nailed him down.

669
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,190
- Our plan didn´t work.
- Go on.

670
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,120
Rescue was out of the question.

671
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:38,189
My God, Trench,
do you know what that means?

672
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,161
It means that my brother was buried alive!

673
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,106
Lt´s all gone.

674
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,516
L´ll go and get some more.

675
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,527
You haven´t been looking for me,
have you, Trench?

676
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,291
And we did have a bargain.

677
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,730
My God.

678
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,501
Sir Edward.

679
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,466
- I thought you´d been...
- Buried?

680
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,298
Yes.

681
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:32,212
Waking up in that horrible oblong box.
No air to breathe.

682
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,345
Trapped and no escape.

683
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,684
The earth raining down on the lid.

684
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,276
Every shovelful burying you more deeply.

685
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:45,224
No, Sir Edward. Julian...

686
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,295
Julian is to blame. I can explain.

687
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:55,229
All I want is that witch doctor!
That was the bargain, after all.

688
01:17:57,973 --> 01:17:59,907
The Starbuck Inn.

689
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,610
Shoreham.

690
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:07,442
Shoreham.

691
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,852
Trench. Why Shoreham?

692
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,451
He was waiting...

693
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:22,955
...for a ship.

694
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,863
Waiting? Why not waiting for me?

695
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:51,785
Are you the man I made my medicine for?

696
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:54,616
Yes.

697
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,183
It worked only too well.

698
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:05,626
Tell me.

699
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:09,068
Have you seen a face like mine before?

700
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,033
Once.

701
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,644
I want to know. Can you help me?

702
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,942
Yes. For gold.

703
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:31,290
Sit down.

704
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:41,668
Do you know what happened in Africa?
Why they did this to me?

705
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,368
I must know.

706
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,875
You are riding through the plantation.

707
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,381
A white king amongst his black slaves...

708
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,950
...who are too ignorant to know
that you are an enemy.

709
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,048
No.

710
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:30,983
No!

711
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,770
I don´t understand.

712
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,278
I know it wasn´t me.

713
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:03,947
You are the man they call Markham?

714
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,146
It is also the name of my brother.

715
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,156
Markham.

716
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,952
You changed nothing! Lt´s still the same!

717
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,050
You´ve got to help me, Doctor.

718
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,991
You´ve got to give me something
to keep me going until the morning.

719
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,520
Very well, come with me.

720
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:07,005
- What´s amusing you?
- It seems you started a fad, my dear...

721
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:10,576
...when you claimed that you saw
a man with a crimson hood.

722
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:12,646
I did see him, you know I did!

723
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,910
Everybody´s seeing him now.
There´s a story here about a man...

724
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:19,783
...in a crimson hood who murdered
a woman in London. He slit her throat.

725
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:23,914
- What is it, Sally?
- I can´t believe it!

726
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:27,590
- What?
- That he´d do such a terrible thing!

727
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,430
Sally, have you seen
a man in a crimson hood?

728
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:36,370
There´s a man staying with
Dr. Neuhartt who wears a hood like that.

729
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,167
- A man who wears a hood.
- I promised not to tell anyone!

730
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,402
Dr. Neuhartt. Yes, of course.

731
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,078
Elizabeth, forgive me,
l´m going out for a little while.

732
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:48,909
Look after Sally.

733
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,510
Ruddock.

734
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,824
If you don´t keep off your feet,
you´ll be dead in the morning.

735
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,234
That´s all the time in the world
for what I have to do.

736
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,803
- More debts?
- The final debts.

737
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:15,742
And more blood?

738
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,638
First I want the reasons, Doctor,
then perhaps the blood.

739
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,749
´Blood will have blood,´ so they say.

740
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,513
Can´t you understand?
You know what´s been done to me.

741
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:32,926
Wouldn´t you want the truth
and then your revenge?

742
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:35,757
How do you expect me
to know how you feel?

743
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,325
Here, drink this.

744
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:39,834
What is this?

745
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,968
Lt´s what you wanted. Something
to keep you on your feet until the morning.

746
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:47,336
Or something to put me
back in the grave for eternity!

747
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:18,262
Why don´t you sit down, my dear.
You look very pale.

748
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,208
I feel a lot better now.

749
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,672
I think we could both do
with a little brandy.

750
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,336
No, l´ll get it.

751
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,893
Hello? Anyone there? Open up!

752
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:56,801
Hello?

753
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:40,820
Who did this?

754
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,050
He attacked...

755
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:46,092
A man in a crimson hood?

756
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,622
Where did he come from?

757
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,824
He was still warm
and straight from the grave. Was that it?

758
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,664
Where did he go? I must find him.

759
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:59,337
Markham Manor.

760
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,041
Markham.

761
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,115
- No!
- Sally...

762
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,383
- You have to help me!
- You´re a murderer!

763
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,855
- You don´t understand anything!
- Please don´t kill me!

764
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:54,257
- I must find Julian. Where is he?
- He´s not here!

765
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:55,522
You´re lying!

766
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:26,653
Elizabeth. What happened?

767
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:29,285
It was Sally.
She was here just a moment ago.

768
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:30,864
- Sally?
- Look!

769
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,673
- It´s Edward.
- Edward?

770
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:46,076
Yes. I can´t explain it now.

771
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,315
L´m going out. You stay here, Elizabeth.

772
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:53,447
- Julian!
- Please, stay here!

773
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,286
Edward.

774
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,828
Edward, stop!

775
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:13,860
Why, Julian?

776
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,833
Edward, stop! Let me explain!

777
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,797
Why, Julian?

778
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,040
Edward, it was an accident.

779
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:24,812
You!

780
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,408
- This should have been you!
- Yes, I know!

781
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:32,316
They were looking for a Markham
to pay back their debts.

782
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:36,319
They found their Markham,
but they took you and not me.

783
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:39,048
There was nothing I could do.
It was too late.

784
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:43,059
It´s not too late, Julian.
Let them have both of us!

785
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,725
This is the one you wanted.

786
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,730
- Edward Markham?
- Yes.

787
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:00,166
Go now.

788
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,240
Markham.

789
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:46,347
Where is Sir Julian?

790
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,480
I think he went
to the top of the house, madam.

791
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,324
Julian, what is it?

792
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:35,896
Nothing.

793
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:44,539
- This is Edward´s room, isn´t it?
- No, Elizabeth.

794
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:51,847
This is my room.
