1
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,626
Let me go!

2
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,340
Let me go!

3
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,560
Edward!

4
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,190
Lord!

5
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,960
Edward!

6
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:06,705
<b>RECTANGULAR ark
Edgar Allan Poe </b></b>

7
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,990
Edward!

8
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,590
Edward, come back!

9
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,380
Edward! No!

10
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,620
You did not leave a choice.
Radok!

11
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,230
Edward!
- Do not do that!

12
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,439
Control yourself!

13
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:56,560
xxx

14
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,340
xxx

15
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,570
Catch him!

16
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,740
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

17
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,987
xxx

18
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:24,965
I do not know what you two are going
but you have to take it from here!

19
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,245
- You're being paid.
- And did it well.

20
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,585
Insufficient.
If the police Dane, what to say? Em?

21
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,190
You do not have nothing to be afraid.

22
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:36,170
You're the only owner of the accommodation
for drunken thieves and whores.

23
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,454
The disgusting smell! What's he there for?
? I would like to know that.

24
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,840
Enough!
None of your business and.

25
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,910
After all, soon eotii.

26
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,530
The sooner the better,
If you ask me.

27
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,280
- It is still not ready..
- But, it's gonna tonight?

28
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,770
Yes. Have you made money?

29
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,230
- Gold?
- Guinea.

30
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:32,520
You will not get
money until they complete the work.

31
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,360
When done, can? Participation this
bring to Africa with you,

32
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,560
the same ship which
You came here.

33
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,790
You'll be rich, N'Galo.

34
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,430
This is what? Ellis.

35
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,890
Do you think they will succeed?

36
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,830
Zaspae when he took this,
and would appear to be dead.

37
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,870
Even,

38
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,820
and if you bring
Sir Edward here...,

39
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,860
May will he help him?

40
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,871
I saw what Vradim? Stage Donga had done
Trust me, Norton.

41
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,970
You saw what my powers

42
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,500
seemed, right?

43
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,230
Yes.

44
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,970
We know things
you know nothing.

45
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,380
I was thinking, D? Ulijan.

46
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,780
I want to veins at sea
the open boat.

47
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:45,900
Yes.

48
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:49,980
The wonderful skarletnoj dress that would entertain
sailors and shook my father.

49
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:53,730
- What? Sorry, Elizabeth,
I was away for miles.

50
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,790
I noticed.

51
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,195
Again in Africa?

52
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,840
Why do you think?

53
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,060
I think that is obvious.

54
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:05,890
Since you're back
are quite different and unlikely people.

55
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:08,736
- It's nonsense.
- No.

56
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,490
Look at you.

57
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,920
Permanent sanjaris,
're depressed.

58
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,615
Often forget that you're with me
and that'll be...

59
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,870
Elizabeth, dear,
I really get? ao.

60
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,190
What happened there?

61
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,065
What are you constantly thinking about?
Please tell me!

62
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,600
No.
Not worth your worry.

63
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,180
When we veneali,
? Want to share? Life.

64
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,255
Let us poeinjati with secrets.
Let's start immediately to share.

65
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,205
Mo? To think, about some things,
but that does not mean that I have not changed.

66
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,050
Crew Cab? In.

67
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,430
I never thought of that.

68
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,690
I thought...

69
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,790
? Want to see that
laugh as before.

70
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,830
So!

71
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,030
Your usual good
Report, Tren..

72
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:21,101
- A thorough and clear..
- I am very glad to be back.

73
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,180
- Africa is full of savages.
- Yes.

74
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,295
Thanks.

75
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,360
If you will be directed to
needs of your

76
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,330
planta? will in Africa
? Iveete well

77
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:39,079
You and your brother.

78
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:41,170
Can not? We forget
Sir Edward, is not it?

79
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:44,620
Sir Edward did not want to
dinner, sir.

80
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:48,080
Thanks, Radok.
Pokusau to convince him later.

81
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,400
As Sir Edward?

82
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,125
What were you expecting, that is better?

83
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,150
I was hoping that was normal.
normal.

84
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:58,300
It seemed that the more normal

85
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,370
While he did not remove the chains.

86
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,321
Madness came over him again,
so he tried to escape.

87
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:09,030
Since then he's getting worse.

88
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:12,520
Every man,

89
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:14,225
? Wants to be free.

90
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,000
How may will to be free,
when as it seems?

91
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:21,100
Do you understand that he is losing and reason?

92
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:25,085
Sometimes the disease
so hard hit

93
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,880
to become dangerous
as an insane beast.

94
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,380
And that puts it in an institution?

95
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:32,785
No.

96
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,560
No. About this we will not even think.

97
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,073
I could not stand
thought of my brother screaming in Bedlamu

98
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:44,285
together with those nesrenicima.

99
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,890
The operation is not an option?

100
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,200
You think they'd poor doctors
able to draw up his face?

101
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:56,740
You think that it touched,
not? elei to

102
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,590
experiment?
No.

103
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,980
I would like to see him.

104
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,720
I do not allow anyone,
to Vig..

105
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:08,970
- It's too dangerous..
- I'm not afraid.

106
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,050
Last time it looked like
that it is pleasing to see me..

107
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,710
Yes, he was better
some time..

108
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,860
Well, perhaps? Participation up.

109
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,740
But please do not allow
to see that you're shocked

110
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:29,435
how his condition deteriorated.

111
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,820
I nepribli? Alas too..

112
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,770
If it comes upon madness,

113
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,180
your only protection of the chains
which is attached..

114
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:42,140
- Thanks. Zapamtiu.
- Radok.

115
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,610
Take Mr. Trenea
to see Sir Edward..

116
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,300
- I'll be at a distance, sir.
- OK, Radok.

117
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,490
Sir Edward!

118
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,460
Sir Edward, I'm Moment

119
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,105
I do not have much time.

120
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,770
I want you to know that I
returned from Africa.

121
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,695
- Have you done what I tra? About?
- Yes.

122
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,710
When will it be?

123
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,085
He'll be ready for two days.

124
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,980
You'll be nagragen if you succeed.

125
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,601
I have to get out of here.

126
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,510
Account at you.

127
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,010
So I was afraid.
You upset him.

128
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,270
I am afraid that to anyone
We must not allow to see him.

129
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:17,960
Good night!

130
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,090
View.

131
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,340
What happened?

132
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,770
- Thieves corpses,
Mr. D? Ulijan.

133
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:41,370
They ran away.

134
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:45,630
Doctors are required
Warm guinea pigs.

135
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,496
You are not shocked?

136
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,115
Better to their barbaric methods
already? conceived of the dead than the way we live.

137
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,725
- I suppose | that you'll pay them dearly.
- Of course.

138
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,405
For some of our people,
that price is the difference BETWEEN

139
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,510
full and empty stomach.
- You're shocked?

140
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:07,725
I understand how important this is? No
poor souls.

141
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,910
That and a good rating in the sky.

142
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,690
Should not God willing
rating, | and not you.

143
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,155
It is? Honorary D? Ulijan!

144
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,770
A man is known
and worse things, Elizabeth.

145
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,900
I'll forget it all.
You must be thinking only about us.

146
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,665
- I hope we will soon veneati.
- As soon as possible.

147
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,075
Your father will power? To succeed me
odvuee in Italy. - What?

148
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,765
- I thought I had his blessing.
- It was before.

149
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,390
Before?

150
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,200
Before you come back
from the black continent.

151
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,150
Before you're fired
most of the servants.

152
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:48,065
Before you were in town
begun to circle? s story.

153
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,055
I'm talking about me?
A house?

154
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,355
Can not you see that you have become
hermit? Of course that story!

155
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,825
Crazy stories about demons and
ghosts rattling chains.

156
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,095
You do not believe in this nonsense?

157
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,485
What do you think?

158
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,115
- What do you think?
- I think they are all lunatics, fools.

159
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,740
Well.

160
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,330
To master.

161
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:37,075
From mistress Elizabeth.
- Thanks, Radok.

162
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,905
Did you took dinner
Sir Edward?

163
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,570

Immediately I was taken.

164
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,660

and? want to be sure
I will not do mistake.

168
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,254
I want you to know that is not my
? Wish to leave you,

169
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,730
But his will is stronger than mine.
Mr. D? Ulijan!

170
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,344
xxx

171
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,450
Sir Edward!
What's the matter, Radok?

172
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,060
Better to Doggett.

173
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,160
Edward, why
take you?

174
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,980
Will your soul
forgive my?

175
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,640
Radok.

176
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,100
Bring me Trenea.
No one else is allowed to know.

177
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:00,770
Yes, sir.

178
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,430
Moment has arrived.

179
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,245
- He died my brother Edward.
- ? I'm sorry to hear that.

180
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,516
There is no reason for? Unfortunately.

181
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,130
For him, death
oslobogenje.

182
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:53,360
- When you gonna be buried?
- When pronages other body.

183
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,755
I do not understand.

184
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,730
The family already long
there was no funeral Tren.

185
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:04,340
xxx

186
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,340
You forgot to Markham go to the grave
with the feeling of responsibility.

187
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,045
Villagers have to pay their respects.

188
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,560
but not? We want the world to see
how Edward looks.

189
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:22,490
? Elish another corpse
that villagers watched?

190
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:25,675
Yes.
Edward is already in the ark.

191
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,120
When the city is nagledao
this second corpse, pokopaemo true.

192
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,825
I do not want to be involved in it.

193
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,720
You are connected with the family
greater part of his? life Tren.

194
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Do you know that the corpse krag
ka? explains hanging?

195
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,330
- As well as forgery.
- What?

196
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,200
I said counterfeiting.

197
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,642
These papers are managed,
get away thousands

198
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:50,380
Guinea from plantations? e.

199
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:53,020
I'm an attorney,
I'm not a businessman.

200
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:56,225
You're a counterfeiter
and proneveritelj,

201
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,460
and now you'll be
and a thief corpse.

202
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,790
Not by his will, D? Ulijan.

203
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:05,970
Ka? In it becomes easier
the deeper sink.

204
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,470
- How long do you know about this?
- I doubted for a while but now I know.

205
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,700
but now I know.

206
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,315
What are you gonna do?

207
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,615
I'll give you another 1,000 guineas,

208
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,710
or I'll give
authorities.

209
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,385
All right, sir D? Ulijan.

210
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,055
Your brother will have
dignified burial.

211
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,805
Give me time
to pronagem body

212
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,850
that would not be ashamed
for your noble lineage.

213
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:41,010
Will you with me to drink brandy?

214
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,940
Thanks.

215
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,450
Brought you the money?

216
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,620
- So?
- Called me.

217
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,255
- It Happened?
- Yes.

218
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,191
When we enter the house
to save succeeding Sir Edward?

219
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,940
Now we will not.

220
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,380
Why not?

221
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,740
My dear Mark,
Sir Edward was already in the ark.

222
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:23,195
What?

223
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,500
I locked the door behind
of which I have no key.

224
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:28,020
I do not understand.

225
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:31,260
However, there is a possibility
to earn.

226
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:32,730
How?

227
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:36,490
D? Ulijan not? Want people to see
that his brother looks like.

228
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:39,660
People? Want to show? E.
a second body.

229
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,900
This is madness!

230
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:45,040
Insanity or not, it'll do.
We shall give him another body.

231
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,365
You do not have anything to do.
At least I do not have to.

232
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,105
Lord, snap! Forget that
Edward? Alive in the ark!

233
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,050
Control yourself, Mark.

234
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:56,260
I already told you anything
can not? emo me to do.

235
00:24:56,295 --> 00:25:00,340
Yes, but.. D? Ulijan offers
a thousand guineas for the corpse.

236
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:05,150
We shall give him one.

237
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,370
Where do we?
Answer me.

238
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,570
N'Galo, we may will help.

239
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,465
- You know what to do?
- Yes, Doctor.

240
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,810
They buried him we excavated it.
So quickly.

241
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:42,855
What about those who are
I promised?

242
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,638
We had some problems,
but do not worry

243
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:47,801
This will be warmer.

244
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,890
Dogoh to pay you.

245
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,480

I came near Hackett

251
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:58,023
Mr. Hackett?

252
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,410
- Sr. Hackett.
- I'm afraid it's busy.

253
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,173
for me it's not busy

- Good evening gospogo.
- Yes.

255
00:28:03,878 --> 00:28:06,565
I am afraid that Mr.
Hackett was not good.

256
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,780
- Well, what happened this time?
- I am afraid that he drank some more wine.

257
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,905
I did not iznenagena.

258
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,070
I assure you
that will soon rise.

259
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,675
Radok tell your gospodaruda Samuel
Member? Want to be seen with him.

260
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,130
It is very important? No.

261
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,575
This is Mark Norton.

262
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,140
- I told you to do it alone.
- I could have.

263
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,050
It'll be better to enter
your valuables.

264
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,220
Yes. Radok!

265
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,860
As you know by how
We returned from Africa,

266
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,885
my brother? lived in solitude
and was,

267
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,630
? Victim of a tropical disease.

268
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,510
Yet he has not forgotten,
village of his youth.

269
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,590
Left great contributions
for the church,

270
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,740
and the poor.

271

xxx

272
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,990
- A thousand guineas for this.
- Bloody money.

273
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:38,390
Hardly.
The man was already dead.

274
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:42,525
- So what really happened in Africa?
- What do you mean?

275
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,890
- Nothing. Only the unusual.
- A what?

276

Revenge?

279

I think it is
concerned.

280
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,970
- Revenge.
- Bo? I revenge.

Earlier that are not interested
The Christian myths.

282
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,240
Sin and Punishment.

283
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,455
And in Africa we were sinful.

284
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,455
Pljaekali have their
land still

285

robbery of their resources, but
They are too innocent to understand.

286
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,390

Give it here. Come on.

312
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,110
I thought it will never arrive.

313
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:32,370
For this will require time and money
Doctor, I think you understand.

314
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,780
Yes.

315
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:38,640
- What this time you have for me?
- A man just buried.

316

His name and the place where the
Chilling is my thing. You know that.

317
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,525
Incidentally, I have something for you.

318
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,230
- What?
- Bring him up and put on the table.

I am afraid there is little
damaged.

320
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,705
We were not able to take a
without the other. Get it?

321
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,190
- You killed it

Why honeymoon
not spend in Africa?

332
00:39:22,975 --> 00:39:24,650
No.

333
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,740
Is not the time, and at first I thought,
to love the land before.

334
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,590
No more, Elizabeth.
I do not want to be right back there again.

You're a good host
Doctor.

Who are you?

You are wrong. Looks

Yes.

so it is dropped or
pushed into the water.

Thank you, Trench, for empty

My name is Heidi.

Of course it should.

What's the matter?
Are you afraid?

535

If you are really the prince of Wales,
you'll have to pay even more.

I know.
A man with purple kapuljaeom.

564

That's it?

But you shall soon know.

If someone learns something,
Bring him back.

574
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,700
All right, Mr. Hawthorne.

575
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:57,725
Ka? Common that the man
with kapuljaeom had no money.

You would not have done such a thing,

Of course it would not.

I do not understand.

605
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,965

Where were you last night?

Propose? Say that the portrait lady
Elizabeth is the same size.

624
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:33,120
Of course different for the style,

I have to go.

643
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:47,080
Later will may develop
details.

644
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,800
Very thank you, it was pleasant.

645
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:59,470
You have Norton and threw the corpse
into a river. Why?

646
01:13:59,505 --> 01:14:01,960
- Nonsense! Who said that?
- I.

647
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:04,770
His body was now in
the judge hands.

648
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:07,360
Anyway is impossible
to identifijuje.

649
01:14:07,395 --> 01:14:12,005
Just as the people from
my village saw as

650
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,575
my brother!

651
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,040
And not only that.

652
01:14:16,075 --> 01:14:21,290
The man who found him a painter.
Drew a sketch. See.

653
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,560
Fortunately I was able
that I take.

654
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,850
Why not return the body
to where you have taken?

655
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:30,355
- It was too risky.
- Why?

656
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:32,670
So what's at stake.

657
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,510
Trench...

658
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,200
How he died that man?

659
01:14:37,235 --> 01:14:40,590
- Why are you so curious about
tugeg work? from any grave is izvagen?

660
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:43,575
- What for all this
- You heard me. Answers.

661
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,415
What do you hide?

662
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:48,520
- I have enough of their problems!
- Do not hide nista. Nesto happens.

663
01:14:48,555 --> 01:14:51,440
Sviga not sound to me more.

664
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,970
If you is important? But you know,

665

I was much more important? is not to
not to? em. I I will not.

666
01:14:57,475 --> 01:15:01,920
One more thing. After this
will no longer do business with me.

667
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,085
You have become too
curious.

668
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,890
In my work
It is too dangerous.

669
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,680
- Weller...
- Dovigenja doctors.

670
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,730
Well, what happened after
Edward is released?

671
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:23,410
Nothing.

672
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,720
You do your own lock
and chained.

673
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,750
- Our plan has failed
- Continue.

674
01:15:31,915 --> 01:15:34,590
Oslobaganje was not possible.

675
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,630
Lord, Trench,
Do you know what that means?

676
01:15:38,905 --> 01:15:42,910
My brother? Iv buried!

677
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,290
No more.

678
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,560
I went to pick up more.

679
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,345
You did not come for me, and had
We agree, Trench?

Lord.

Sir Edward.

683

684
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,536
Yes.

685
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,310
I woke up in that
u? asnom ark,

686
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:34,395
I had no air.

687
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,610
I was trapped. The country is
down on the lid.

688
01:17:36,645 --> 01:17:39,290
With every swing of shovels buried
I am more deeply.

689
01:17:42,265 --> 01:17:45,100
No, Sir Edward.
D? Ulian...

In Shorehamu.

694
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,950
Shorehamu?

695
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,650
Trench!
Why Shorham?

696
01:18:19,685 --> 01:18:22,845
He's waiting... ship.

697
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,010
Waiting.
Why is waiting for me?

698
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,270
You're the man for whom
I put a cure?

699
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:54,740
Yes.

700
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,360
It is well acted.

xxx

702
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,320
Have you seen the face of
such as mine?

703
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,530
Once.

704
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,960
Is it possible? Frequently to help me?

705
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:22,450
Yes, for the gold.

706
01:20:30,165 --> 01:20:31,940
Sit.

707
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,815
Do you know what happened in Africa?
Why do I do this?

708
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,660
I need to know.

709
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,975
You rode through
planta? in

White King, among
black slaves,

01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,900
who do not know that you are
their enemy.

712
01:21:03,935 --> 01:21:05,180
No.

713
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:56,450
xxx

714
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:59,470
No. I do not understand.
I know it was not me.

715
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:04,300
You are the man
who called Markham?

716
01:22:04,975 --> 01:22:08,790
My brother has the same
name.

717
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:12,687
Markham... Markham...

718

Nothing has changed you!
I'm still the same!

722
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,080
You must help me, doctor.

Give me something to endure? Them
until morning.

724
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,810
Well, perish with me.

but really I have seen!
Now it all vigaju!

728
01:24:12,635 --> 01:24:15,530

01:24:15,565 --> 01:24:19,870
killed? woman in London.
Killed her.

Sally, and you saw
man with kapuljaeom?

733
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:36,585
He stayed in

734
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:38,930
I promised I will not
tell anyone.

735
01:24:38,965 --> 01:24:42,530
- Dr. Njuhart, yes.
Yes, of course.

736
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:46,850
Elizabeth, forgive
izai'll briefly.

737
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,900
Watch out for Sally.

738

Radok!

If you do not lie down,
umrees till morning.

741
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,170
So we need time.

742
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,640
- For more deaths?
- The final death.

743
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:15,845
And blood?

744
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,900
First? Want reasons, Doctor.

You know what we have done.

01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:32,760
Do not you? Wanted
truth and revenge?

01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,700
How do I know how

Why not sit down, dear?

01:26:23,565 --> 01:26:25,240
No, I will bring it.

756
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,430
Hey!
Is anyone there?

757
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,020
Who did this?

758
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,990
Man...

759
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,390
A man with purple
kapuljaeom? - Yes.

760
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:48,345
Where did it come from?

761
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:52,235
He was warm,
izvagen from the grave.

Edward, stop!

781
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,260

Why, Julian?
Why?

784
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:23,490
