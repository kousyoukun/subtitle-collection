2
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,524
Unus in nihil...

3
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:50,203
Omnia in duos...

4
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,791
Duo in unum...

5
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,712
Unum in nihil.

6
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,855
Nec quattuor...

7
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:22,610
nec omnia, nec unus, nec nihil sunt.

8
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,136
- Is this...?
- Yes, this is Cragganmore.

9
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:34,641
Yes, this is the house of Ulrich.
And no, he won't see you.

10
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,395
- But...
- I know. Your business is urgent.

11
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,730
It doesn't matter. He sees no one.

12
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,859
- Please...
- Please yourself. Go home.

13
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,907
Well, what do we do now, boy?

14
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,911
You who knows so much,
answer me that.

15
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,586
Hear me,
you who dwell in Cragganmore.

16
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:08,258
Ulrich, we will stay here
until we are heard.

17
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:21,146
Magister?

18
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,998
- What is it?
- We have visitors.

19
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,044
I know.

20
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:47,339
- I will see them.
- You will?

21
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,591
Yes.

22
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:53,011
There's a great task
needing to be done.

23
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:59,893
I have been witness to something -
something of consequence to you.

24
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:05,440
- To me?
- Yes. My own death.

25
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,447
I knew it. Thieves.

26
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:33,009
Looks forbidding enough,
don't you think?

27
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,053
Oh, yes.

28
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,514
Master?

29
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:42,811
No. They'd think me infirm.

30
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:47,190
Balisarius wore this before he died.

31
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,989
You know, I actually
saw him change lead into gold.

32
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:59,619
I could never do that.
Mmm... Too bad.

33
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:02,330
You'd have stood
to inherit some real wealth.

34
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:05,959
Magister, please,
don't talk like that.

35
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:10,463
- You're not going to die.
- Oh, I look forward to it.

36
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,551
All this magic,
what has it accomplished?

37
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,930
Tell me, how are your studies going?

38
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:23,018
Fine. They're going well.

39
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,979
You still wish to be a sorcerer?

40
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:31,609
- Oh, yes. More than anything.
- Well, then, adeptus minor,

41
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:35,905
get yourself a handful
of that sulphurous ash over there.

42
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:13,026
Nunc habeamus lucem...

43
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,699
...et calorem.

44
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:34,547
Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich.

45
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,509
Which of you men
calls himself Valerian?

46
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:44,683
- We are here on behalf...
- I know why you're here.

47
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:50,313
You're a delegation from Urland,
which is beyond Dalvatia.

48
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:53,692
Let's see the artefacts.

49
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,749
Scales.

50
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,836
- How did you come by these?
- I found them

51
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:16,214
at the mouth of the lair.

52
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:18,466
What else?

53
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:26,599
- A claw.
- That's no claw, by the gods.

54
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:31,938
It's a tooth!
You want me to do battle with that?!

55
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:38,278
- Who else can we turn to?
- Did you try the Meredydd Sisters?

56
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:42,532
What about Rinbod?
I heard tell he killed a dragon once.

57
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:46,161
They're all dead.
You're the only one left.

58
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,665
It's a long way to Urland.

59
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:57,255
Twice each year,
at the spring and autumn equinox,

60
00:08:57,464 --> 00:09:01,343
the King selects
a new victim - virgins.

61
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,846
A lottery. Barbaric.

62
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:07,515
And in return, this dragon,

63
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:11,144
it leaves your villages
and crops unburned.

64
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:16,650
Your king
has made a pact with a monster.

65
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:19,694
- Master, don't you think...?
- Silence.

66
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,696
Are you afraid of dragons?

67
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,909
No.

68
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:30,205
In fact, if it weren't for sorcerers,
there wouldn't be any dragons.

69
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:33,333
Once the skies were dotted with them.

70
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,336
Magnificent horned backs,
leather wings,

71
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:40,674
soaring in their hot-breath wind.

72
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,010
I know this creature of yours...

73
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,931
Vermithrax Pejorative.

74
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:52,018
Look at these scales, these ridges.

75
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:57,524
When a dragon gets this old,
it knows only pain, constant pain.

76
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:02,195
It grows decrepit, crippled...

77
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:05,740
pitiful... spiteful.

78
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,244
Will you help us?

79
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,623
Here. Good.

80
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,917
Now let me go.

81
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:19,671
No...

82
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,717
No, not a bit too heavy.

83
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:28,596
I'll conquer the highest mountain.
What say you, Galen?

84
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,102
Speak up, boy. Hodge?

85
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,688
Er... If you say so, sir.

86
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:43,320
When I've gone,
see you keep your nose in your books

87
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:46,281
and your hands out of my reagents.

88
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:50,952
How far can you get? A league? Two?

89
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:53,913
I'm not worried about the road.

90
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,170
Tyrian.

91
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:04,257
Good morrow.

92
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:09,137
What do you want?

93
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:12,015
Young Master Valerian,

94
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:15,477
The question is,
what do you want so far from home?

95
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:18,521
We're not afraid of you.
Give us the road.

96
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:23,193
Why, the road is yours,
all the way to Urland.

97
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,695
It's a long journey, isn't it?

98
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:29,324
But when you're
in search of a sorcerer,

99
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:31,993
I suppose no distance is too great.

100
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:37,248
- Say nothing.
- Here's the mystical one himself.

101
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:41,670
You'd best keep your distance...
and your manners.

102
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:46,633
If he's ready to slay a dragon,
he's nothing to fear from me.

103
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:52,430
I've no more love for that creature
than you lot, nor has the King,

104
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,226
but before you stir things up,

105
00:11:56,434 --> 00:12:01,606
don't you think you should find out
if he's the right man for the job?

106
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:06,861
Ah! So it's a test you're
looking for? We don't do tests.

107
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,823
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

108
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,745
They never do tests.
Nor many real deeds.

109
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:20,041
Oh, conversation with your
grandmother's shade in a dark room,

110
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,086
the odd love potion,
but comes a doubter -

111
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:26,631
why, then it's the wrong day,
the planets aren't in line,

112
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,676
the entrails aren't favourable,
"We don't do tests".

113
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,554
We've got no doubts.
We require no tests.

114
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:35,849
- And you're not going to get one.
- Enough!

115
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:39,436
Here. Put this in the conjuring room.

116
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:44,482
Go to the iron box.
Bring me the dagger within.

117
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:46,735
The dagger. Be quick.

118
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:53,116
You shall have your test.

119
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:10,675
Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

120
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:17,015
- It's not this one, is it?
- The very one. Let it fall.

121
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,221
Mortem confundit magus.

122
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:21,538
- No! Stop him!
- Go on. Don't worry.

123
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:24,332
You can't hurt me.

124
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:09,456
Magical powers indeed.
Look at you now - magical ashes.

125
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,469
Hodge!

126
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,056
Hodge!

127
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:23,048
The kindest lord
a man could ever wish for.

128
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:25,508
Now he's gone.

129
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:31,139
Ye gods! You'd think he could boil
his own eggs at the snap of a finger,

130
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:34,643
but no, he had old Hodge to do it.

131
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:40,815
Up at five every morning, clearing
out the cages, emptying the slops.

132
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:43,943
Never a thank you
or a pat on the back.

133
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,529
I shall miss him.

134
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:49,282
- I do already.
- Oh, no, you don't.

135
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:53,411
All you think about
is your tricks and your knavery,

136
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,540
but you don't pull any wool
over these old eyes.

137
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:03,254
You'll have to walk far before
you fill his shoes, mark my words.

138
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:06,925
What's the matter, Hodge?
Pack too heavy?

139
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:16,017
No! Don't! Stop that! I need that!

140
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:19,688
Oh, give it back to me! This way!

141
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:22,148
I think you're too warm.

142
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,362
Stop it!
Out of respect for the master!

143
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,367
I have as much respect
for the master as anyone, old man,

144
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:34,703
but I'm master now.

145
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,045
I left my farm and for what?

146
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:47,257
For a cremation, that's what.

147
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:51,803
All because
someone said find a magician -

148
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:57,434
not a local fellow, an import,
some 100 leagues from home -

149
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,479
an all-powerful necromancer.

150
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:05,650
Huh! That's some necromancer.

151
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:08,611
Hold your tongue, Griel. Eat.

152
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,864
I'll not eat. I'm not hungry.

153
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:17,579
He's right.
I brought us here for nothing.

154
00:21:25,837 --> 00:21:28,715
What is it? Who's there?

155
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:33,720
Salvete, viatores!

156
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:36,973
Good morrow.
Good morrow. Peace be with you.

157
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,267
What do you want?

158
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:43,188
My lord Ulrich is no longer.

159
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:47,817
All that you asked of him,
you may now expect of me.

160
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:52,572
The dangers he would face,
I will now conquer.

161
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:57,077
The task he would undertake,
I will now fulfil.

162
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:03,833
I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor
of Ulrich's craft and knowledge...

163
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:08,672
and I am the sorcerer you seek.

164
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:43,248
Close enough. Bring her out.

165
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:09,149
Now be it known throughout
the kingdom that this maiden,

166
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:13,153
having lawfully been chosen
by a deed of fortune and destiny,

167
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:17,782
shall hereby give up her life
for the greater good of Urland...

168
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:25,874
By this act shall be satisfied
the powers that dwell underground

169
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:29,669
and the spirits that attend thereto.

170
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,297
In gratitude for this sacrifice,

171
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:37,177
His Majesty declares the family
Plowman to be free of obligations

172
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:40,472
for a period
not to exceed five years.

173
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,311
Duly ordained!

174
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:58,837
What have you got there, Hodge?

175
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:01,589
- None of your business.
- Gold, eh?

176
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,052
- Shall I change it into lead?
- Save your jokes for someone else.

177
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:10,140
I do not care
for braggarts... or frauds.

178
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:14,227
- I'm no fraud.
- Fool, then.

179
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:17,314
Upstart. Whatever pleases you.

180
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:20,817
Look, Hodge,
nobody forced you to come along.

181
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:23,486
I came of my own
free will, all right.

182
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:26,573
We each do the Master's bidding
in our own way.

183
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:45,133
What are you doing? Don't come in!

184
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:51,264
- How's the water?
- It's cold.

185
00:27:56,686 --> 00:28:00,106
I prefer to swim alone
if you don't mind.

186
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:09,949
Stay away!

187
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:18,708
- Look. Isn't that the...?
- Yes.

188
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:22,045
- The retainer from Cragganmore.
- Why is he here?

189
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:26,883
- Filling in for his chief.
- You going to allow that, sir?

190
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:33,473
Bring me my bow.

191
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:40,230
No, I'm not going to say anything.

192
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:45,777
I don't blame you.
I was careless. A silly woman.

193
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:50,782
Oh, I... I knew the moment I saw you.
I've known the whole time.

194
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:53,034
You never knew a thing.

195
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:57,205
No one's known, not since I was born.

196
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:01,167
The lottery.

197
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:04,587
- Daughters are chosen, sons are not.
- That's right.

198
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:08,925
- Unless you're the King's daughter.
- What do you mean?

199
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,763
If you're rich enough,
your name never goes in.

200
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:16,266
My father is poor.

201
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:20,103
So are a lot of fathers.

202
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,746
No!

203
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,749
No!

204
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,295
No!

205
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:30,382
Hodge!

206
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:33,093
Hodge!

207
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,306
Hodge.

208
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:48,650
- Galen, can you hear me?
- I hear you.

209
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:54,072
Do you know, somebody shot me,
but I can still talk.

210
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,449
There's something
that needs to be done.

211
00:30:56,658 --> 00:31:00,120
- I know.
- No, no. Not the dragon.

212
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:03,415
The master's ashes. Here.

213
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:08,044
I'm sorry.
You'll have to peel it loose.

214
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:13,800
- Burning water!
- What?

215
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,262
Find the lake. Throw it in.

216
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:20,765
Hodge, what are you doing with this?

217
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:23,435
Burning... water.

218
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,897
Hodge, don't die.

219
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:31,735
Listen to me.
You're not going to die.

220
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:51,481
Urland.

221
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:09,225
Come on. Don't slow down here.

222
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:14,356
- Is the whole kingdom like this?
- No. We're near the lair.

223
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:17,108
The lair? Where is it?

224
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:21,446
- It doesn't matter.
- Show me. Where?

225
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:26,242
We're in no danger
if we just pass through quickly.

226
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:28,578
I want to see it.

227
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:31,831
Griel.

228
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:40,966
Malkin! Malkin!

229
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:16,876
- Are there other entrances?
- No. One's enough.

230
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:26,886
Don't be a fool! You'll provoke it!

231
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:31,725
How do you know it's in there?

232
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:39,899
Go on, then.
Get yourself burned alive.

233
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,069
What a fine trick that will be.

234
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:37,248
Vermithrax?

235
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:09,489
Tu saxum saxorum

236
00:37:09,698 --> 00:37:12,450
in adversum montem operam da!

237
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:17,998
Inatibulum inquinatum draconis!

238
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,671
No! Consistete!

239
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:15,847
Redite... No!

240
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:22,687
Ascedete!

241
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:10,276
He's done it!

242
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:21,431
Put that away!

243
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:26,353
What if you were seen?

244
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,539
Musicians?

245
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:18,214
She was twice the man
of anyone in the village.

246
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:20,842
Now she's twice the woman.

247
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:24,137
Would that I was
as clever as her father.

248
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:30,018
Come, Griel.
Don't begrudge a life spared.

249
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:32,937
No, I... I begrudge nothing.

250
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:39,277
But I wonder at what we have seen...
and how it was done.

251
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:43,031
- You were there.
- Aye. And isn't it strange

252
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,701
that the very moment
that the beast was put down,

253
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,371
there should be a holy man
in the village?

254
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:51,623
Now, isn't that strange?

255
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:02,384
Could the Christian god
bring down a mountain?

256
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,595
- Is it possible, Father?
- Of course. Why not?

257
00:43:41,172 --> 00:43:46,803
A celebration!
Well, don't stop on my account.

258
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:52,767
Musicians, more music.

259
00:43:56,771 --> 00:44:00,442
A toast... to the deed of the day.

260
00:44:03,361 --> 00:44:05,405
What would you have of us?

261
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:09,242
With you? Not a thing.

262
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,995
It's this one.

263
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:19,127
The King would meet
our new-found benefactor,

264
00:44:19,336 --> 00:44:23,381
and offer his gratitude
to the one man who has succeeded

265
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:25,800
where so many have failed.

266
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:30,388
What sort of gratitude?

267
00:44:30,597 --> 00:44:33,516
A knife in the belly?
An arrow in the chest?

268
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:39,981
My young friend, I would as soon
dispatch you as I did the rest,

269
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:43,109
and for the same reason,

270
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,281
but His Majesty would have a cosy
little chat and commands otherwise.

271
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:02,712
Behold. Eggs fit for a king.

272
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:08,051
All right...

273
00:45:08,176 --> 00:45:11,429
How many of you
have ever seen a table fly?

274
00:45:11,638 --> 00:45:15,892
None of you. None of you
have ever seen a table fly.

275
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:18,144
Stand back.

276
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:25,485
Heus... mensa... surge!

277
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:33,827
Surge mensa.

278
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:56,182
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Enough. That'll do.

279
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:59,227
- I can do this.
- It's not necessary.

280
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:03,857
Tell me, the landslide,
it was accomplished this same way?

281
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:05,442
Er... yes.

282
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,611
Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric?

283
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,656
Oh, no. Of course not.
You weren't even born.

284
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:17,329
He was my brother. A great king
and a valiant man-at-arms.

285
00:46:18,246 --> 00:46:21,291
When he ascended the throne,
the dragon was unbridled.

286
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:24,336
No one knew where
it might strike next,

287
00:46:24,502 --> 00:46:27,589
so he brought forth
his broadsword and his spear,

288
00:46:27,797 --> 00:46:32,218
assembled his fighters
and went out to do battle.

289
00:46:35,722 --> 00:46:38,141
He was never seen again,

290
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,854
but his attack provoked terrible
reprisals - villages incinerated,

291
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:47,651
entire crops burned, death, famine...

292
00:46:50,945 --> 00:46:52,989
Horrible.

293
00:46:55,367 --> 00:47:00,205
How did you arrogate
to yourself the role of saviour?

294
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:03,500
- I was invited.
- Not by me.

295
00:47:07,545 --> 00:47:12,342
I think you're nothing
but a boy... an apprentice.

296
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:18,932
Have you considered
the consequences of failure?

297
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:22,769
What failure?
You want the dragon back?

298
00:47:22,894 --> 00:47:25,563
You came here
and toyed with a monster!

299
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,025
Who are you
to risk our people, our villages?

300
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:32,737
- But your children were dying!
- Only a few.

301
00:47:32,946 --> 00:47:36,157
It is better they die
that others might live.

302
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:39,577
I created the lottery - me -

303
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:42,914
and from the moment it began,
the dragon was tamed.

304
00:47:43,123 --> 00:47:46,710
- The kingdom has prospered.
- At what price?

305
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:52,507
You can't make
a shameful peace with dragons.

306
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:56,970
- You must kill them as I have done.
- The beast is dead?

307
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:00,307
Yes, it's dead.

308
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,144
We shall see.

309
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,271
Caela... orrida... aperere.

310
00:48:53,276 --> 00:48:57,781
Open up, I say! Caela orrida aperere!

311
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:00,408
Salve, magister juvenilis.

312
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,913
I studied Latin. Greek, too.

313
00:49:05,997 --> 00:49:09,292
Me apellant Elspeth, filiam Regis.

314
00:49:11,503 --> 00:49:15,256
Filiam Regis? You're his daughter.

315
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:18,927
Please don't think ill of us.

316
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:23,348
Father is a wise
and even-handed man. He's...

317
00:49:23,556 --> 00:49:25,684
What happened to you?

318
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:29,688
Nothing. Just some
of the King's even-handedness.

319
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:34,484
It... It's better
for everyone this way.

320
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:36,736
A king must protect his people.

321
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:40,824
Naturally.
Just as he protects his daughter.

322
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:47,872
What do you mean by that?

323
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:53,503
- Are you referring to the lottery?
- You know about the lottery?

324
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:59,092
I have participated in every
choosing since I came of age.

325
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:01,344
The whole kingdom knows that.

326
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:06,641
You don't have to pretend.
Not to me. Not down here.

327
00:50:09,352 --> 00:50:14,232
Everyone knows
how this... choosing works -

328
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,779
the families
with money, royal connections...

329
00:50:20,488 --> 00:50:23,742
You've participated
in a lie. You know it.

330
00:50:25,118 --> 00:50:27,787
- I have to go now.
- You know I'm right.

331
00:50:27,954 --> 00:50:30,081
Vale. Dorme bene.

332
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:47,057
Horsrik, remove all but one bar.
We'll try it one at a time.

333
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:55,607
- I, Casiodorus Rex...
- Father...

334
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:59,486
do some families pay bribes
to stay out of the lottery?

335
00:50:59,736 --> 00:51:01,363
Nonsense.

336
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,576
By the power of this amulet,
justly wielded by my hand

337
00:51:06,743 --> 00:51:09,120
in accordance
with the laws of Urland,

338
00:51:09,412 --> 00:51:12,666
now, lead, be thou gold.

339
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,251
I'm burnt!

340
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:18,505
Have you ever kept
my name off the lottery list?

341
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:20,715
What are you suggesting?

342
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:25,053
Am I not exposed to the same risk
as other men's daughters?

343
00:51:25,303 --> 00:51:28,515
There's been a loose tongue
here somewhere, sire.

344
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:32,143
- Where did you get such ideas?
- Answer my question.

345
00:51:32,394 --> 00:51:37,899
Please... Don't think
of such things, I beg you.

346
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:41,069
- Answer me.
- The answer is no.

347
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:44,114
I mean yes. You are a participant.

348
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:47,492
We have seen to that.
How could we not?

349
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:49,244
Yes...

350
00:51:50,495 --> 00:51:52,622
The answer is yes.

351
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,294
- You are lying to me.
- Elspeth!

352
00:52:16,104 --> 00:52:18,148
Stay calm.

353
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:35,498
Go on.

354
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,096
You little meddler!

355
00:52:51,848 --> 00:52:53,683
Stop him!

356
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:10,617
Close the gate!
What are you waiting for, idiots?

357
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:15,372
Stop him!

358
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:36,935
Tyrian!

359
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:42,691
In here! So much for your magic.
So much for your sorcery.

360
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:46,778
Feel that? It's alive.

361
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:19,519
Listen to me. The moment of our fear
is the hour of our triumph.

362
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:23,231
This is a sign from God.

363
00:54:26,985 --> 00:54:31,698
Horns, tail, wings
and clawed feet - this is no dragon.

364
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,950
This is Lucifer!

365
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,288
Dear Father, we beseech thee,

366
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:42,584
show us thy goodness
in this evil place.

367
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,878
Show us thy power.

368
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:50,967
Cursed worm, a devil flung
from Heaven will now rise from Hell!

369
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:59,184
Stay and fear the word of God!

370
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:02,437
You call yourselves Christians?!

371
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:10,320
Fear not, brethren.
There is no dragon.

372
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:30,191
Unclean beast! Get thee down!

373
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:40,744
Be thou consumed
by the fires that made thee!

374
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:03,702
- Where is he?
- Not here. Can't help you.

375
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:18,800
As the proud new father of a daughter

376
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:21,594
who has somehow
been overlooked all these years,

377
00:58:21,803 --> 00:58:25,682
it may interest you to know
the King has called a new lottery.

378
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,934
It's months to the solstice.

379
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:31,313
In view of what's happened,
we all know what's required.

380
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:35,734
I've never taken part
in your cursed lottery. I won't now.

381
00:58:38,903 --> 00:58:43,366
You were very clever, but
she will take part like all the rest.

382
00:58:44,075 --> 00:58:46,119
No exceptions.

383
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:48,371
- I want to be in it.
- Silence, child.

384
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,460
I'm no different to any other girl.
My name will go in.

385
00:58:53,668 --> 00:58:57,589
Nothing.
If he was here, he's gone now.

386
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,953
Blacksmith,
have you ever forged a weapon?

387
00:59:47,555 --> 00:59:50,850
This is "Secarius draconum" -
Dragonslayer.

388
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:00,235
- The best I ever made.
- It's beautiful.

389
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:03,113
But I never had the nerve to use it.

390
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:17,544
That won't help. What you want
to kill isn't flesh and blood.

391
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:20,547
- It'll bleed.
- How do you know?

392
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:26,094
- No one's so much as scratched it.
- She's right. I'll need the amulet.

393
01:02:30,135 --> 01:02:32,512
Stir the tiles!

394
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:35,098
Stir the tiles!

395
01:02:35,348 --> 01:02:39,561
Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

396
01:02:44,441 --> 01:02:48,236
Draw the name! Draw the name!

397
01:02:48,486 --> 01:02:50,530
Draw the name!

398
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:53,742
Draw the name!

399
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,077
Draw the name!

400
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:07,380
Now, my countrymen, hear me.

401
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:11,426
Behold, for I am chosen.

402
01:03:11,635 --> 01:03:14,220
I shall die that many may live.

403
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:19,476
I shall lay down my life
for family and fellows.

404
01:03:19,684 --> 01:03:26,483
I shall go to my grave for the love
of our king and his wise policy.

405
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,736
And my name is...

406
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,914
- Read the name!
- Read the name!

407
01:03:41,122 --> 01:03:43,458
Read the name!

408
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:52,509
Read the name! Read the name!

409
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:58,264
Read the name.

410
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:07,399
The name
is Princess Elspeth Ulfilas...

411
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:10,277
...filia Regis.

412
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:14,406
That is not the name.
It has been misread.

413
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:17,951
There's no mistake.
The name's been drawn. Let it stand.

414
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:22,163
No. The good Horsrik
has misspoke himself.

415
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:27,836
In fairness to this individual,
we will destroy this tile.

416
01:04:28,044 --> 01:04:29,421
No!

417
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:31,881
No. What better name
than your own kin?

418
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:35,260
- At last, we see justice done.
- Silence!

419
01:04:35,468 --> 01:04:37,512
We will have a new choosing.

420
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,558
I will draw the name myself.

421
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:44,644
Let it stand! Let it stand!

422
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:54,988
The name is as Horsrik read it...

423
01:04:57,824 --> 01:04:59,284
Elspeth.

424
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:07,334
And this one... And another...

425
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:10,295
Another... And another...

426
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:13,381
And another. What treachery is this?

427
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:17,969
- The lottery is invalid.
- Hear me, good people.

428
01:05:18,178 --> 01:05:21,348
It is true that my name
appears on all the lots.

429
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:26,144
This does not invalidate
the lottery, it certifies it.

430
01:05:26,353 --> 01:05:28,396
It redresses an injustice.

431
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:34,444
I have learned that my name was kept
from jeopardy in all past drawings.

432
01:05:34,778 --> 01:05:38,448
Therefore, I have substituted
my name for yours

433
01:05:38,698 --> 01:05:44,454
for the risk that over the years
you have taken and I have not.

434
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:41,886
You, Tyrian.
Surely you'll do something.

435
01:06:42,095 --> 01:06:45,265
If not for me,
out of loyalty to the kingdom.

436
01:06:45,473 --> 01:06:48,143
But that's just it, Your Majesty.

437
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:51,354
My first duty
is loyalty to the kingdom.

438
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:57,736
Don't go to all that trouble.

439
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,866
If you want a fight,
give me a weapon.

440
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:05,744
- I think not.
- Stop!

441
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,288
Don't harm him.

442
01:07:08,496 --> 01:07:11,499
And... you, please...

443
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:17,714
I'm a great admirer
of the black arts.

444
01:07:17,922 --> 01:07:22,802
You chaps
with your... mysterious spells.

445
01:07:23,011 --> 01:07:27,223
I didn't think it would be necessary.
Vermithrax is an old dragon.

446
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:31,019
That, I thought,
was the beauty of my plan - time.

447
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:35,899
We'd wait it out.
I'd live to see the end of it...

448
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:41,237
I will see the end of it.

449
01:07:42,447 --> 01:07:44,741
Sire, consider what you are doing.

450
01:07:45,617 --> 01:07:48,119
Give him that,
he'll destroy all you've built.

451
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,622
He shall have it.

452
01:07:51,873 --> 01:07:53,959
It's my daughter.

453
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:56,628
Save her, I beg you.

454
01:08:16,356 --> 01:08:21,069
The princess - what's her name? -

455
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:25,573
Elspeth. Her name's Elspeth.

456
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,953
There, good and hot.

457
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:34,165
That's not the kind of fire we need.

458
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,591
Nunc per potestatem

459
01:08:44,259 --> 01:08:47,846
hermeticum ex flammis,

460
01:08:50,265 --> 01:08:53,810
ferrum sanguinarium.

461
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:26,051
Good. Now turn it over.

462
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:01,438
An edge like no other on this earth.

463
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:12,407
I'll say goodbye to her for you.

464
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:16,911
Sorry she's not here.
You know how she is.

465
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,164
I understand.

466
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,918
Fare thee well.

467
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:43,521
It's a shield. I made it.

468
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:47,943
It might keep the fire
off you, it might not.

469
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:51,613
You know, you're an idiot.

470
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:56,076
You're going to die tonight.
You'll be ripped limb from limb.

471
01:11:56,326 --> 01:12:00,664
This is the last time
I'll ever speak to you.

472
01:12:02,415 --> 01:12:05,502
- Thank you.
- Another thing...

473
01:12:06,711 --> 01:12:08,755
I've been up there.

474
01:12:08,964 --> 01:12:11,007
That thing isn't alone.

475
01:12:11,925 --> 01:12:14,594
It's got little ones. Young, I think.

476
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:18,056
- I don't know how many.
- They must be killed, too.

477
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:20,976
Anything else?

478
01:12:28,984 --> 01:12:31,361
You're in love, aren't you?

479
01:12:32,946 --> 01:12:34,781
Yes.

480
01:12:37,909 --> 01:12:39,953
It's all right.

481
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:42,580
I understand.

482
01:12:42,789 --> 01:12:46,751
She's very beautiful, very brave.

483
01:12:47,836 --> 01:12:50,005
Who is? What do you mean?

484
01:12:50,213 --> 01:12:52,257
Your princess.

485
01:12:55,427 --> 01:12:57,554
But I don't care.

486
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:04,644
Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn,

487
01:13:04,853 --> 01:13:06,980
sorcerer's apprentice...

488
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,734
you're going to be dead...

489
01:13:11,943 --> 01:13:14,613
the dragon will be worse than ever,

490
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:19,534
there will be more lotteries...
and I'm not a boy any more.

491
01:13:19,784 --> 01:13:24,748
- And you'll be eligible because...
- Because I'm still a virgin.

492
01:13:42,098 --> 01:13:44,142
I am in love...

493
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:51,232
...but not with the Princess.

494
01:14:32,107 --> 01:14:34,192
Your Highness?

495
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:50,792
Now be it known throughout
the kingdom that Princess Elspeth,

496
01:14:51,001 --> 01:14:55,463
having lawfully been chosen
by a deed of fortune and destiny...

497
01:15:05,098 --> 01:15:07,183
No more smoke, I beg you.

498
01:15:07,434 --> 01:15:09,811
Begone!

499
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,148
I declare these proceedings...

500
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:16,776
duly ordained!

501
01:15:19,487 --> 01:15:22,157
I knew I'd find you here.

502
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:27,537
Well, I'm not
as sentimental as His Majesty.

503
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:33,251
The kingdom, every one of us,
needs this sacrifice.

504
01:15:34,753 --> 01:15:37,589
If you intend to interfere...

505
01:15:38,632 --> 01:15:40,759
you'll have to kill me.

506
01:15:48,183 --> 01:15:53,521
I've plenty of reasons to kill you
that have nothing to do with this.

507
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,774
Most impressive.

508
01:15:57,192 --> 01:16:00,946
- Can you use it?
- No! Stop!

509
01:16:01,154 --> 01:16:04,157
Tyrian is right!
This is our only hope!

510
01:16:28,223 --> 01:16:29,849
Tyrian!

511
01:16:32,227 --> 01:16:35,146
This is no warrior.

512
01:16:45,365 --> 01:16:47,200
Run!

513
01:16:51,955 --> 01:16:53,790
Run!

514
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,473
Where are you going?

515
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:19,733
You've failed, my friend...
and I thank the gods for it.

516
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:35,457
Now prepare yourself...

517
01:18:26,716 --> 01:18:28,760
Elspeth.

518
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:18,081
It's still alive.

519
01:27:37,517 --> 01:27:40,270
You know what we have to do.

520
01:27:41,313 --> 01:27:43,481
We have to leave.

521
01:27:45,317 --> 01:27:47,402
You said you loved me.

522
01:27:48,653 --> 01:27:50,697
Is it true?

523
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,328
If it is...

524
01:27:57,412 --> 01:28:00,081
it's the only good we've done.

525
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:05,503
Let's not lose that, too.

526
01:28:07,964 --> 01:28:10,008
Galen?

527
01:28:11,343 --> 01:28:15,221
She's right. What kind
of life could you have here?

528
01:28:16,514 --> 01:28:18,558
You know what I think?

529
01:28:18,767 --> 01:28:23,438
Magic, magicians -
it's all fading from the world.

530
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:26,232
Dying out. That makes me happy.

531
01:28:27,442 --> 01:28:30,487
That means
the dragon will be dying, too.

532
01:28:36,326 --> 01:28:37,953
Valerian.

533
01:28:39,829 --> 01:28:41,873
Something from your father.

534
01:28:46,544 --> 01:28:48,797
You want me to wear this?

535
01:28:49,005 --> 01:28:51,758
What harm can it do?

536
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:34,175
What is it?

537
01:29:35,218 --> 01:29:37,262
What's the matter?

538
01:29:43,393 --> 01:29:45,437
What is that?

539
01:29:55,572 --> 01:29:57,198
Look.

540
01:30:01,786 --> 01:30:04,372
- At what?
- There.

541
01:30:05,457 --> 01:30:09,419
That old trickster.
The burning water.

542
01:30:10,337 --> 01:30:12,422
The lake of fire.

543
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:17,927
He had it planned...
from the beginning.

544
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:20,388
He knew this was going to happen.

545
01:30:20,597 --> 01:30:23,433
Who did? What happened?

546
01:30:23,642 --> 01:30:27,437
We've got to go back.
I have to talk to him.

547
01:30:28,229 --> 01:30:30,273
Where are you going?

548
01:30:34,986 --> 01:30:38,406
We can slay this dragon with prayer.

549
01:30:38,615 --> 01:30:40,951
If we but join together in faith,

550
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:46,706
we shall live,
and the beast shall die.

551
01:30:46,957 --> 01:30:51,252
Galen, stop!
I won't let you kill yourself.

552
01:30:53,421 --> 01:30:58,343
He couldn't make the journey,
so he had us make it for him.

553
01:30:58,551 --> 01:31:00,595
Don't you see?

554
01:31:04,557 --> 01:31:06,601
All right. I'm coming, too.

555
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:10,272
- No. This is for me to do.
- I'm not afraid.

556
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,943
After all, I was a man, remember?

557
01:31:19,447 --> 01:31:22,117
Nunc... fax... incendere.

558
01:31:23,493 --> 01:31:25,537
Stay close.

559
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:29,332
- What's that?
- Nothing.

560
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:32,627
- I want to see.
- No, you don't.

561
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,549
All right. Wait here.

562
01:31:47,225 --> 01:31:49,477
Galen?

563
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:54,566
Galen?

564
01:32:00,405 --> 01:32:02,741
Where are you?

565
01:32:13,335 --> 01:32:16,212
Ex favilla...

566
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:19,466
vita... nova!

567
01:33:49,598 --> 01:33:55,186
Sic redit magnus ex terra mortuorum.

568
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:03,194
You're back!

569
01:34:03,778 --> 01:34:08,491
- I thank the powers that made me.
- Glad to see you, too.

570
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,912
You didn't bring along anything
to eat, by any chance?

571
01:34:13,121 --> 01:34:16,958
- Food?
- But come along. There's much to do.

572
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:22,672
No, please...
I thought I was a sorcerer. I'm not.

573
01:34:23,798 --> 01:34:26,551
I thought I had power. I don't.

574
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,220
You said to be strong. I wasn't.

575
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:32,307
But you were, my boy. You were.

576
01:34:32,515 --> 01:34:34,559
And you'll be stronger yet.

577
01:34:36,895 --> 01:34:40,941
Thou art baptised in the name of
the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.

578
01:34:41,191 --> 01:34:45,570
And may the Lord lead us
from darkness and demons...

579
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,656
Look!

580
01:35:43,169 --> 01:35:47,007
Draco... draconum.

581
01:35:58,977 --> 01:36:00,812
Galen!

582
01:36:06,901 --> 01:36:08,945
This is Valerian.

583
01:36:09,696 --> 01:36:11,740
I know. I remember.

584
01:36:12,824 --> 01:36:16,620
The girl who came to us as a boy.

585
01:36:18,622 --> 01:36:21,082
There's something you must do.

586
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:23,168
Anything.

587
01:36:24,878 --> 01:36:27,380
I want you to destroy the amulet...

588
01:36:30,967 --> 01:36:33,470
...and me along with it.

589
01:36:41,186 --> 01:36:45,649
You brought me from the flames,
you must send me back.

590
01:36:46,816 --> 01:36:49,486
You'll know the time.

591
01:36:49,694 --> 01:36:54,574
You must act
while life is still in me.

592
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:43,164
Tempestus!

593
01:37:49,838 --> 01:37:52,507
Imber!

594
01:38:17,282 --> 01:38:18,742
Fulmen!

595
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:34,883
There.

596
01:39:47,872 --> 01:39:50,542
Here, Galen. Do what he said.

597
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:53,670
Destroy the amulet. Smash it.

598
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:57,090
No! He said I'd know the time.

599
01:40:54,481 --> 01:40:56,816
- He told you to do it!
- Not yet!

600
01:42:13,852 --> 01:42:15,478
Galen!

601
01:43:48,363 --> 01:43:54,494
Let us pray. We thank thee, Lord,
for this divine deliverance.

602
01:43:54,703 --> 01:43:58,748
Verily is thy presence
amongst us fully manifest

603
01:43:58,915 --> 01:44:01,376
in this, thy great work.

604
01:44:22,063 --> 01:44:24,107
Arise, children of the Lord.

605
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,612
Forsake forever the pagan mysteries,

606
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:31,656
the superstitions of the past.

607
01:44:31,823 --> 01:44:34,034
Rejoice in the power of God...

608
01:44:34,242 --> 01:44:38,204
All hail Casiodorus Rex -

609
01:44:38,413 --> 01:44:40,457
Dragonslayer.

610
01:44:50,675 --> 01:44:54,179
- You miss Ulrich?
- Yes.

611
01:44:54,387 --> 01:44:57,390
- And the amulet?
- That, too.

612
01:44:57,974 --> 01:45:01,311
I don't. I'm glad it's gone.

613
01:45:01,519 --> 01:45:04,397
You may not be a sorcerer,
Galen Bradwardyn,

614
01:45:04,606 --> 01:45:07,359
but that doesn't matter, not to me.

615
01:45:07,525 --> 01:45:10,278
I know. I just wish...

616
01:45:11,863 --> 01:45:14,699
- What?
- We had a horse.

617
01:45:15,305 --> 01:45:21,787
