1
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,842
Unus in nihil...

2
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:47,011
Omnia in duos...

3
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,413
Duo in unum...

4
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:55,176
Unum in nihil.

5
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:12,586
Nec quattuor...

6
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:18,109
nec omnia, nec unus, nec nihil sunt.

7
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:02,304
Oh!

8
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,218
Get-get back.

9
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:16,352
Oh...

10
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,731
- Is this...?
- Yes, this is Cragganmore.

11
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:27,052
Yes, this is the house of Ulrich.
And no, he won't see you.

12
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,652
- But...
- I know. Your business is urgent.

13
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:32,894
It doesn't matter. He sees no one.

14
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:36,853
- Please...
- Please yourself. Go home.

15
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,655
Well, what do we do now, boy?

16
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:46,495
You who knows so much,
answer me that.

17
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:54,817
Hear me,
you who dwell in Cragganmore.

18
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:59,297
Ulrich, we will stay here
until we are heard.

19
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:11,658
Magister?

20
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:29,740
- What is it?
- We have visitors.

21
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,622
I know.

22
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,782
- I will see them.
- You will?

23
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,943
Yes.

24
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:42,222
There's a great task
needing to be done.

25
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:48,823
I have been witness to something -
something of consequence to you.

26
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:54,144
- To me?
- Yes. My own death.

27
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,866
I knew it. Thieves.

28
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:20,587
Looks forbidding enough,
don't you think?

29
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,548
Oh, yes.

30
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:24,908
Master?

31
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:29,988
No. They'd think me infirm.

32
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,189
Balisarius wore this before he died.

33
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:40,709
You know, I actually
saw him change lead into gold.

34
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,111
I could never do that.
Mmm... Too bad.

35
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,709
You'd have stood
to inherit some real wealth.

36
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,190
Magister, please,
don't talk like that.

37
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:56,511
- You're not going to die.
- Oh, I look forward to it.

38
00:05:56,671 --> 00:06:00,433
All this magic,
what has it accomplished?

39
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,631
Tell me, how are your studies going?

40
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,552
Fine. They're going well.

41
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,393
You still wish to be a sorcerer?

42
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:16,793
- Oh, yes. More than anything.
- Well, then, adeptus minor,

43
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:20,913
get yourself a handful
of that sulphurous ash over there.

44
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,517
Nunc habeamus lucem...

45
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,919
...et calorem.

46
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,161
Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich.

47
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,001
Which of you men
calls himself Valerian?

48
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:26,882
- We are here on behalf...
- I know why you're here.

49
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:32,283
You're a delegation from Urland,
which is beyond Dalvatia.

50
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:35,522
Let's see the artifacts.

51
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,924
Scales.

52
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,885
- How did you come by these?
- I found them

53
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:57,126
at the mouth of the lair.

54
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:59,286
What else?

55
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:07,086
- A claw.
- That's no claw, by the gods.

56
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:12,208
It's a tooth!
You want me to do battle with that?!

57
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:18,289
- Who else can we turn to?
- Did you try the Meredydd Sisters?

58
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:22,369
What about Rinbod?
I heard tell he killed a dragon once.

59
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,850
They're all dead.
You're the only one left.

60
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,170
It's a long way to Urland.

61
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:36,490
Twice each year,
at the spring and autumn equinox,

62
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,411
the King selects
a new victim - virgins.

63
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:43,771
A lottery. Barbaric.

64
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:46,332
And in return, this dragon,

65
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:49,813
it leaves your villages
and crops unburned.

66
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:55,092
Your king
has made a pact with a monster.

67
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,013
- Master, don't you think...?
- Silence.

68
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,933
Are you afraid of dragons?

69
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:03,974
No.

70
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:08,095
In fact, if it weren't for sorcerers,
there wouldn't be any dragons.

71
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:11,095
Once the skies were dotted with them.

72
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:13,975
Magnificent horned backs,
leather wings,

73
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:18,137
soaring in their hot-breath wind.

74
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,337
I know this creature of yours...

75
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:25,098
Vermithrax Pejorative.

76
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,018
Look at these scales, these ridges.

77
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,298
When a dragon gets this old,
it knows only pain, constant pain.

78
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,780
It grows decrepit, crippled...

79
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,179
pitiful... spiteful.

80
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,540
Will you help us?

81
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,740
Here. Good.

82
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,941
Now let me go.

83
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,542
No...

84
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:59,419
No, not a bit too heavy.

85
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,102
I'll conquer the highest mountain.
What say you, Galen?

86
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,383
Speak up, boy. Hodge?

87
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,862
Err... If you say so, sir.

88
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:18,224
When I've gone,
see you keep your nose in your books

89
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,064
and your hands out of my reagents.

90
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:25,545
How far can you get? A league? Two?

91
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:28,384
I'm not worried about the road.

92
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,385
Tyrian.

93
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:38,306
Good morrow.

94
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,987
What do you want?

95
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,747
Young Master Valerian,

96
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:49,067
The question is,
what do you want so far from home?

97
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,988
We're not afraid of you.
Give us the road.

98
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:56,468
Why, the road is yours,
all the way to Urland.

99
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,869
It's a long journey, isn't it?

100
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,348
But when you're
in search of a sorcerer,

101
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,909
I suppose no distance is too great.

102
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,949
- Say nothing.
- Here's the mystical one himself.

103
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,190
You'd best keep your distance...
and your manners.

104
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,950
If he's ready to slay a dragon,
he's nothing to fear from me.

105
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,511
I've no more love for that creature
than you lot, nor has the King,

106
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:28,152
but before you stir things up,

107
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:33,312
don't you think you should find out
if he's the right man for the job?

108
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:38,353
Ah! So it's a test you're
looking for? We don't do tests.

109
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,193
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

110
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:46,874
They never do tests.
Nor many real deeds.

111
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:50,995
Oh, conversation with your
grandmother's shade in a dark room,

112
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,915
the odd love potion,
but comes a doubter -

113
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:57,316
why, then it's the wrong day,
the planets aren't in line,

114
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,235
the entrails aren't favorable,
"We don't do tests".

115
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:02,995
We've got no doubts.
We require no tests.

116
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:06,156
- And you're not going to get one.
- Enough!

117
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:09,597
Here. Put this in the conjuring room.

118
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:14,437
Go to the iron box.
Bring me the dagger within.

119
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,597
The dagger. Be quick.

120
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,718
You shall have your test.

121
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:39,560
Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

122
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,640
- It's not this one, is it?
- The very one. Let it fall.

123
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:23,246
Mortem confundit magus.

124
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:47,529
- No! Stop him!
- Go on. Don't worry.

125
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,209
You can't hurt me.

126
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:28,589
Magical powers indeed.
Look at you now - magical ashes.

127
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,640
Hodge!

128
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,080
Hodge!

129
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:36,723
The kindest lord
a man could ever wish for.

130
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:39,084
Now he's gone.

131
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:44,485
Ye gods! You'd think he could boil
his own eggs at the snap of a finger,

132
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,846
but no, he had old Hodge to do it.

133
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:53,767
Up at five every morning, clearing
out the cages, emptying the slops.

134
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,766
Never a thank you
or a pat on the back.

135
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:59,247
I shall miss him.

136
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,888
- I do already.
- Oh, no, you don't.

137
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:05,848
All you think about
is your tricks and your knavery,

138
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:09,808
but you don't pull any wool
over these old eyes.

139
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:15,290
You'll have to walk far before
you fill his shoes, mark my words.

140
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,810
What's the matter, Hodge?
Pack too heavy?

141
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,530
No! Don't! Stop that! I need that!

142
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:31,051
Oh, give it back to me! This way!

143
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,412
I think you're too warm.

144
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,412
Stop it!
Out of respect for the master!

145
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:43,212
I have as much respect
for the master as anyone, old man,

146
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,452
but I'm master now.

147
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:54,414
I left my farm and for what?

148
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:57,494
For a cremation, that's what.

149
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:01,856
All because
someone said find a magician -

150
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:07,256
not a local fellow, an import,
some 100 leagues from home -

151
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,136
an all-powerful necromancer.

152
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:15,137
Huh! That's some necromancer.

153
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:17,977
Hold your tongue, Griel. Eat.

154
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,138
I'll not eat. I'm not hungry.

155
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:26,578
He's right.
I brought us here for nothing.

156
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,260
What is it? Who's there?

157
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,060
Salvete, viatores!

158
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,180
Good morrow.
Good morrow. Peace be with you.

159
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,381
What do you want?

160
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:51,141
My lord Ulrich is no longer.

161
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:55,581
All that you asked of him,
you may now expect of me.

162
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,141
The dangers he would face,
I will now conquer.

163
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,463
The task he would undertake,
I will now fulfill.

164
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:10,943
I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor
of Ulrich's craft and knowledge...

165
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:15,584
and I am the sorcerer you seek.

166
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,748
Close enough. Bring her out.

167
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,591
Now be it known throughout
the kingdom that this maiden,

168
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,432
having lawfully been chosen
by a deed of fortune and destiny,

169
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:21,871
shall hereby give up her life
for the greater good of Urland...

170
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:29,632
By this act shall be satisfied
the powers that dwell underground

171
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:33,273
and the spirits that attend thereto.

172
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:35,793
In gratitude for this sacrifice,

173
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:40,474
His Majesty declares the family
Plowman to be free of obligations

174
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:43,634
for a period
not to exceed five years.

175
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:49,236
Duly ordained!

176
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:53,898
What have you got there, Hodge?

177
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:56,537
- None of your business.
- Gold, eh?

178
00:25:56,738 --> 00:26:00,819
- Shall I change it into lead?
- Save your jokes for someone else.

179
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,739
I do not care
for braggarts... or frauds.

180
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,660
- I'm no fraud.
- Fool, then.

181
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,620
Upstart. Whatever pleases you.

182
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,980
Look, Hodge,
nobody forced you to come along.

183
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:17,540
I came of my own
free will, all right.

184
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,500
We each do the Master's bidding
in our own way.

185
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:38,305
What are you doing? Don't come in!

186
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:44,184
- How's the water?
- It's cold.

187
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:52,666
I prefer to swim alone
if you don't mind.

188
00:27:00,146 --> 00:27:02,107
Stay away!

189
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:10,508
- Look. Isn't that the...?
- Yes.

190
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:13,708
- The retainer from Cragganmore.
- Why is he here?

191
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:18,348
- Filling in for his chief.
- You going to allow that, sir?

192
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,668
Bring me my bow.

193
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,150
No, I'm not going to say anything.

194
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:36,471
I don't blame you.
I was careless. A silly woman.

195
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:41,271
Oh, I... I knew the moment I saw you.
I've known the whole time.

196
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,431
You never knew a thing.

197
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:47,432
No one's known, not since I was born.

198
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:51,233
The lottery.

199
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:54,512
- Daughters are chosen, sons are not.
- That's right.

200
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:58,673
- Unless you're the King's daughter.
- What do you mean?

201
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:03,313
If you're rich enough,
your name never goes in.

202
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:05,714
My father is poor.

203
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:09,395
So are a lot of fathers.

204
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:06,602
No!

205
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,482
No!

206
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,842
No!

207
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:16,804
Hodge!

208
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:19,403
Hodge!

209
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:24,404
Hodge.

210
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:34,326
- Galen, can you hear me?
- I hear you.

211
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:39,526
Do you know, somebody shot me,
but I can still talk.

212
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:41,806
There's something
that needs to be done.

213
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:45,326
- I know.
- No, no. Not the dragon.

214
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:48,487
The master's ashes. Here.

215
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:52,928
I'm sorry.
You'll have to peel it loose.

216
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:58,448
- Burning water!
- What?

217
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:01,768
Find the lake. Throw it in.

218
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,130
Hodge, what are you doing with this?

219
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:07,689
Burning... water.

220
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,969
Hodge, don't die.

221
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:15,649
Listen to me.
You're not going to die.

222
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,139
Urland.

223
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:46,709
Come on. Don't slow down here.

224
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:51,629
- Is the whole kingdom like this?
- No. We're near the lair.

225
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:54,270
The lair? Where is it?

226
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:58,429
- It doesn't matter.
- Show me. Where?

227
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:03,030
We're in no danger
if we just pass through quickly.

228
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,270
I want to see it.

229
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:08,390
Griel.

230
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,152
Malkin! Malkin!

231
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:51,597
- Are there other entrances?
- No. One's enough.

232
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,198
Don't be a fool! You'll provoke it!

233
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,838
How do you know it's in there?

234
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,680
Go on, then.
Get yourself burned alive.

235
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,721
What a fine trick that will be.

236
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,686
Vermithrax?

237
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:39,611
Tu saxum saxorum

238
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:42,451
in adversum montem operam da!

239
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:47,772
Inatibulum inquinatum draconis!

240
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,458
No! Consistete!

241
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:43,257
Redite... No!

242
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,818
Ascedete!

243
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:35,464
He's done it!

244
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,712
Put that away!

245
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,435
What if you were seen?

246
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:47,121
Musicians?

247
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:35,726
She was twice the man
of anyone in the village.

248
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:38,247
Now she's twice the woman.

249
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:41,407
Would that I was
as clever as her father.

250
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:47,049
Come, Griel.
Don't begrudge a life spared.

251
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:49,847
No, I... I begrudge nothing.

252
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:55,927
But I wonder at what we have seen...
and how it was done.

253
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:59,529
- You were there.
- Aye. And isn't it strange

254
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:03,049
that the very moment
that the beast was put down,

255
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:05,610
there should be a holy man
in the village?

256
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,770
Now, isn't that strange?

257
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:18,091
Could the Christian god
bring down a mountain?

258
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,170
- Is it possible, Father?
- Of course. Why not?

259
00:41:55,294 --> 00:42:00,696
A celebration!
Well, don't stop on my account.

260
00:42:03,097 --> 00:42:06,418
Musicians, more music.

261
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:13,778
A toast... to the deed of the day.

262
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:18,538
What would you have of us?

263
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:22,219
With you? Not a thing.

264
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,860
It's this one.

265
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,701
The King would meet
our new-found benefactor,

266
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:35,780
and offer his gratitude
to the one man who has succeeded

267
00:42:35,941 --> 00:42:38,101
where so many have failed.

268
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,502
What sort of gratitude?

269
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:45,503
A knife in the belly?
An arrow in the chest?

270
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:51,702
My young friend, I would as soon
dispatch you as I did the rest,

271
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:54,702
and for the same reason,

272
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:59,663
but His Majesty would have a cozy
little chat and commands otherwise.

273
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:13,506
Behold. Eggs fit for a king.

274
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:18,626
All right...

275
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:21,866
How many of you
have ever seen a table fly?

276
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:26,147
None of you. None of you
have ever seen a table fly.

277
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:28,307
Stand back.

278
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,348
Heus... mensa... surge!

279
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:43,349
Surge mensa.

280
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:04,793
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Enough. That'll do.

281
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:07,711
- I can do this.
- It's not necessary.

282
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:12,153
Tell me, the landslide,
it was accomplished this same way?

283
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:13,672
Err... yes.

284
00:44:13,873 --> 00:44:16,714
Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric?

285
00:44:16,914 --> 00:44:19,635
Oh, no. Of course not.
You weren't even born.

286
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:25,075
He was my brother. A great king
and a valiant man-at-arms.

287
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,876
When he ascended the throne,
the dragon was unbridled.

288
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:31,797
No one knew where
it might strike next,

289
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:34,917
so he brought forth
his broadsword and his spear,

290
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:39,358
assembled his fighters
and went out to do battle.

291
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:45,038
He was never seen again,

292
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,557
but his attack provoked terrible
reprisals - villages incinerated,

293
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:54,157
entire crops burned, death, famine...

294
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,279
Horrible.

295
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:06,199
How did you arrogate
to yourself the role of savior?

296
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:09,360
- I was invited.
- Not by me.

297
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,842
I think you're nothing
but a boy... an apprentice.

298
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:24,162
Have you considered
the consequences of failure?

299
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:27,842
What failure?
You want the dragon back?

300
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:30,523
You came here
and toyed with a monster!

301
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:33,843
Who are you
to risk our people, our villages?

302
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:37,404
- But your children were dying!
- Only a few.

303
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:40,685
It is better they die
that others might live.

304
00:45:40,884 --> 00:45:43,965
I created the lottery - me -

305
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:47,164
and from the moment it began,
the dragon was tamed.

306
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:50,804
- The kingdom has prospered.
- At what price?

307
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:56,366
You can't make
a shameful peace with dragons.

308
00:45:56,565 --> 00:46:00,645
- You must kill them as I have done.
- The beast is dead?

309
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:03,845
Yes, it's dead.

310
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:07,527
We shall see.

311
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:49,851
Caela... orrida... aperere.

312
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:58,972
Open up, I say! Caela orrida aperere!

313
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:01,492
Salve, magister juvenilis.

314
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,813
I studied Latin. Greek, too.

315
00:47:06,854 --> 00:47:10,014
Me apellant Elspeth, filiam Regis.

316
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:15,735
Filiam Regis? You're his daughter.

317
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:19,255
Please don't think ill of us.

318
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:23,496
Father is a wise
and even-handed man. He's...

319
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:25,737
What happened to you?

320
00:47:25,937 --> 00:47:29,577
Nothing. Just some
of the King's even-handedness.

321
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:34,178
It... It's better
for everyone this way.

322
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:36,338
A king must protect his people.

323
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:40,259
Naturally.
Just as he protects his daughter.

324
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:47,018
What do you mean by that?

325
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:52,418
- Are you referring to the lottery?
- You know about the lottery?

326
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,780
I have participated in every
choosing since I came of age.

327
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,939
The whole kingdom knows that.

328
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:05,021
You don't have to pretend.
Not to me. Not down here.

329
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:12,301
Everyone knows
how this... choosing works -

330
00:48:13,662 --> 00:48:17,622
the families
with money, royal connections...

331
00:48:18,303 --> 00:48:21,423
You've participated
in a lie. You know it.

332
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:25,304
- I have to go now.
- You know I'm right.

333
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:27,504
Vale. Dorme bene.

334
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:43,785
Horsrik, remove all but one bar.
We'll try it one at a time.

335
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:51,987
- I, Casiodorus Rex...
- Father...

336
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:55,708
do some families pay bribes
to stay out of the lottery?

337
00:48:55,947 --> 00:48:57,508
Nonsense.

338
00:48:58,388 --> 00:49:02,508
By the power of this amulet,
justly wielded by my hand

339
00:49:02,668 --> 00:49:04,948
in accordance
with the laws of Urland,

340
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:08,349
now, lead, be thou gold.

341
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:10,831
I'm burnt!

342
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,950
Have you ever kept
my name off the lottery list?

343
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,071
What are you suggesting?

344
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:20,231
Am I not exposed to the same risk
as other men's daughters?

345
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:23,553
There's been a loose tongue
here somewhere, sire.

346
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,031
- Where did you get such ideas?
- Answer my question.

347
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:32,552
Please... Don't think
of such things, I beg you.

348
00:49:32,713 --> 00:49:35,593
- Answer me.
- The answer is no.

349
00:49:35,793 --> 00:49:38,513
I mean yes. You are a participant.

350
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:41,754
We have seen to that.
How could we not?

351
00:49:41,953 --> 00:49:43,434
Yes...

352
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:46,673
The answer is yes.

353
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:51,153
- You are lying to me.
- Elspeth!

354
00:50:09,198 --> 00:50:11,156
Stay calm.

355
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:27,801
Go on.

356
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,801
You little meddler!

357
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:45,239
Stop him!

358
00:50:57,522 --> 00:51:01,483
Close the gate!
What are you waiting for, idiots?

359
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:06,043
Stop him!

360
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:26,727
Tyrian!

361
00:51:28,287 --> 00:51:32,248
In here! So much for your magic.
So much for your sorcery.

362
00:51:33,888 --> 00:51:36,168
Feel that? It's alive.

363
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:07,571
Listen to me. The moment of our fear
is the hour of our triumph.

364
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,131
This is a sign from God.

365
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:19,253
Horns, tail, wings
and clawed feet - this is no dragon.

366
00:52:19,453 --> 00:52:21,413
This is Lucifer!

367
00:52:23,493 --> 00:52:25,573
Dear Father, we beseech thee,

368
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:29,695
show us thy goodness
in this evil place.

369
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,895
Show us thy power.

370
00:52:32,094 --> 00:52:37,733
Cursed worm, a devil flung
from Heaven will now rise from Hell!

371
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:45,614
Stay and fear the word of God!

372
00:52:46,615 --> 00:52:48,735
You call yourselves Christians?!

373
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:56,297
Fear not, brethren.
There is no dragon.

374
00:54:08,587 --> 00:54:12,907
Unclean beast! Get thee down!

375
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:23,029
Be thou consumed
by the fires that made thee!

376
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,596
- Where is he?
- Not here. Can't help you.

377
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:57,078
As the proud new father of a daughter

378
00:55:57,279 --> 00:55:59,760
who has somehow
been overlooked all these years,

379
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:03,680
it may interest you to know
the King has called a new lottery.

380
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,841
It's months to the solstice.

381
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,080
In view of what's happened,
we all know what's required.

382
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,322
I've never taken part
in your cursed lottery. I won't now.

383
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:20,642
You were very clever, but
she will take part like all the rest.

384
00:56:21,323 --> 00:56:23,283
No exceptions.

385
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:25,444
- I want to be in it.
- Silence, child.

386
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:30,324
I'm no different to any other girl.
My name will go in.

387
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:34,284
Nothing.
If he was here, he's gone now.

388
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:03,407
Blacksmith,
have you ever forged a weapon?

389
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:25,371
This is "Secarius draconum" -
Dragonslayer.

390
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,371
- The best I ever made.
- It's beautiful.

391
00:57:34,573 --> 00:57:37,131
But I never had the nerve to use it.

392
00:57:47,573 --> 00:57:50,973
That won't help. What you want
to kill isn't flesh and blood.

393
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:53,853
- It'll bleed.
- How do you know?

394
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:59,174
- No one's so much as scratched it.
- She's right. I'll need the amulet.

395
00:59:58,149 --> 01:00:00,430
Stir the tiles!

396
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:02,910
Stir the tiles!

397
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:07,190
Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

398
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:15,512
Draw the name! Draw the name!

399
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:17,712
Draw the name!

400
01:00:17,912 --> 01:00:20,792
Draw the name!

401
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,033
Draw the name!

402
01:00:31,232 --> 01:00:33,873
Now, my countrymen, hear me.

403
01:00:34,114 --> 01:00:37,754
Behold, for I am chosen.

404
01:00:37,953 --> 01:00:40,433
I shall die that many may live.

405
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:45,474
I shall lay down my life
for family and fellows.

406
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:52,196
I shall go to my grave for the love
of our king and his wise policy.

407
01:00:52,356 --> 01:00:55,316
And my name is...

408
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:06,038
- Read the name!
- Read the name!

409
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:08,477
Read the name!

410
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:17,158
Read the name! Read the name!

411
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,680
Read the name.

412
01:01:26,759 --> 01:01:31,441
The name
is Princess Elspeth Ulfilas...

413
01:01:31,561 --> 01:01:34,200
...filia Regis.

414
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,161
That is not the name.
It has been misread.

415
01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:41,561
There's no mistake.
The name's been drawn. Let it stand.

416
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:45,602
No. The good Horsrik
has misspoke himself.

417
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:51,043
In fairness to this individual,
we will destroy this tile.

418
01:01:51,242 --> 01:01:52,562
No!

419
01:01:52,763 --> 01:01:54,923
No. What better name
than your own kin?

420
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:58,164
- At last, we see justice done.
- Silence!

421
01:01:58,364 --> 01:02:00,324
We will have a new choosing.

422
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:04,204
I will draw the name myself.

423
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:07,165
Let it stand! Let it stand!

424
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:17,087
The name is as Horsrik read it...

425
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:21,206
Elspeth.

426
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:28,927
And this one... And another...

427
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:31,768
Another... And another...

428
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,728
And another. What treachery is this?

429
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:39,129
- The lottery is invalid.
- Hear me, good people.

430
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:42,368
It is true that my name
appears on all the lots.

431
01:02:42,569 --> 01:02:46,968
This does not invalidate
the lottery, it certifies it.

432
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:49,129
It redresses an injustice.

433
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,930
I have learned that my name was kept
from jeopardy in all past drawings.

434
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:58,771
Therefore, I have substituted
my name for yours

435
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:04,532
for the risk that over the years
you have taken and I have not.

436
01:03:55,978 --> 01:03:59,618
You, Tyrian.
Surely you'll do something.

437
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:02,860
If not for me,
out of loyalty to the kingdom.

438
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,621
But that's just it, Your Majesty.

439
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:08,700
My first duty
is loyalty to the kingdom.

440
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:14,821
Don't go to all that trouble.

441
01:04:17,261 --> 01:04:19,740
If you want a fight,
give me a weapon.

442
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:22,502
- I think not.
- Stop!

443
01:04:22,662 --> 01:04:24,941
Don't harm him.

444
01:04:25,142 --> 01:04:28,021
And... you, please...

445
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:33,983
I'm a great admirer
of the black arts.

446
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:38,865
You chaps
with your... mysterious spells.

447
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:43,104
I didn't think it would be necessary.
Vermithrax is an old dragon.

448
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,743
That, I thought,
was the beauty of my plan - time.

449
01:04:46,944 --> 01:04:51,426
We'd wait it out.
I'd live to see the end of it...

450
01:04:53,665 --> 01:04:56,546
I will see the end of it.

451
01:04:57,706 --> 01:04:59,906
Sire, consider what you are doing.

452
01:05:00,746 --> 01:05:03,146
Give him that,
he'll destroy all you've built.

453
01:05:03,388 --> 01:05:05,547
He shall have it.

454
01:05:06,747 --> 01:05:08,747
It's my daughter.

455
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:11,309
Save her, I beg you.

456
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:34,750
The princess - what's her name? -

457
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:39,070
Elspeth. Her name's Elspeth.

458
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:43,271
There, good and hot.

459
01:05:44,112 --> 01:05:47,312
That's not the kind of fire we need.

460
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:56,353
Nunc per potestatem

461
01:05:56,993 --> 01:06:00,434
hermeticum ex flammis,

462
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:06,155
ferrum sanguinarium.

463
01:06:34,518 --> 01:06:37,078
Good. Now turn it over.

464
01:08:05,608 --> 01:08:08,570
An edge like no other on this earth.

465
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,089
I'll say goodbye to her for you.

466
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:23,411
Sorry she's not here.
You know how she is.

467
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:25,570
I understand.

468
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:30,132
Fare thee well.

469
01:08:45,772 --> 01:08:48,934
It's a shield. I made it.

470
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:53,175
It might keep the fire
off you, it might not.

471
01:08:54,616 --> 01:08:56,695
You know, you're an idiot.

472
01:08:56,896 --> 01:09:00,976
You're going to die tonight.
You'll be ripped limb from limb.

473
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:05,376
This is the last time
I'll ever speak to you.

474
01:09:07,057 --> 01:09:10,018
- Thank you.
- Another thing...

475
01:09:11,177 --> 01:09:13,137
I've been up there.

476
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:15,297
That thing isn't alone.

477
01:09:16,178 --> 01:09:18,737
It's got little ones. Young, I think.

478
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:22,059
- I don't know how many.
- They must be killed, too.

479
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,858
Anything else?

480
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,821
You're in love, aren't you?

481
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:38,099
Yes.

482
01:09:41,101 --> 01:09:43,061
It's all right.

483
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,580
I understand.

484
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:49,582
She's very beautiful, very brave.

485
01:09:50,622 --> 01:09:52,702
Who is? What do you mean?

486
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:54,862
Your princess.

487
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,943
But I don't care.

488
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:06,744
Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn,

489
01:10:06,943 --> 01:10:08,984
sorcerer's apprentice...

490
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,584
you're going to be dead...

491
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:16,305
the dragon will be worse than ever,

492
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:21,025
there will be more lotteries...
and I'm not a boy any more.

493
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:26,026
- And you'll be eligible because...
- Because I'm still a virgin.

494
01:10:42,668 --> 01:10:44,628
I am in love...

495
01:10:49,069 --> 01:10:51,428
...but not with the Princess.

496
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:32,635
Your Highness?

497
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:48,556
Now be it known throughout
the kingdom that Princess Elspeth,

498
01:11:48,756 --> 01:11:53,037
having lawfully been chosen
by a deed of fortune and destiny...

499
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:04,278
No more smoke, I beg you.

500
01:12:04,518 --> 01:12:06,799
Begone!

501
01:12:06,998 --> 01:12:09,999
I declare these proceedings...

502
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:13,480
duly ordained!

503
01:12:16,078 --> 01:12:18,640
I knew I'd find you here.

504
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:23,800
Well, I'm not
as sentimental as His Majesty.

505
01:12:23,999 --> 01:12:29,281
The kingdom, every one of us,
needs this sacrifice.

506
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,441
If you intend to interfere...

507
01:12:34,442 --> 01:12:36,480
you'll have to kill me.

508
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:48,724
I've plenty of reasons to kill you
that have nothing to do with this.

509
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:50,884
Most impressive.

510
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:55,845
- Can you use it?
- No! Stop!

511
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,925
Tyrian is right!
This is our only hope!

512
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:23,567
Tyrian!

513
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:28,649
This is no warrior.

514
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:40,210
Run!

515
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:46,532
Run!

516
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:02,532
Where are you going?

517
01:14:06,974 --> 01:14:11,414
You've failed, my friend...
and I thank the gods for it.

518
01:14:23,536 --> 01:14:26,495
Now prepare yourself...

519
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:17,622
Elspeth.

520
01:23:43,364 --> 01:23:45,324
It's still alive.

521
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:06,607
You know what we have to do.

522
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:09,687
We have to leave.

523
01:24:11,448 --> 01:24:13,449
You said you loved me.

524
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:16,610
Is it true?

525
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:22,009
If it is...

526
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,609
it's the only good we've done.

527
01:24:28,651 --> 01:24:30,811
Let's not lose that, too.

528
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:35,130
Galen?

529
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:40,132
She's right. What kind
of life could you have here?

530
01:24:41,371 --> 01:24:43,333
You know what I think?

531
01:24:43,532 --> 01:24:48,012
Magic, magicians -
it's all fading from the world.

532
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:50,692
Dying out. That makes me happy.

533
01:24:51,852 --> 01:24:54,772
That means
the dragon will be dying, too.

534
01:25:00,372 --> 01:25:01,934
Valerian.

535
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:05,694
Something from your father.

536
01:25:10,175 --> 01:25:12,335
You want me to wear this?

537
01:25:12,535 --> 01:25:15,175
What harm can it do?

538
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,860
What is it?

539
01:25:56,859 --> 01:25:58,820
What's the matter?

540
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,662
What is that?

541
01:26:16,384 --> 01:26:17,943
Look.

542
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,824
- At what?
- There.

543
01:26:25,863 --> 01:26:29,664
That old trickster.
The burning water.

544
01:26:30,546 --> 01:26:32,543
The lake of fire.

545
01:26:34,384 --> 01:26:37,825
He had it planned...
from the beginning.

546
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:40,186
He knew this was going to happen.

547
01:26:40,385 --> 01:26:43,107
Who did? What happened?

548
01:26:43,306 --> 01:26:46,945
We've got to go back.
I have to talk to him.

549
01:26:47,705 --> 01:26:49,665
Where are you going?

550
01:26:54,187 --> 01:26:57,467
We can slay this dragon with prayer.

551
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:59,908
If we but join together in faith,

552
01:27:00,147 --> 01:27:05,428
we shall live,
and the beast shall die.

553
01:27:05,668 --> 01:27:09,789
Galen, stop!
I won't let you kill yourself.

554
01:27:11,868 --> 01:27:16,590
He couldn't make the journey,
so he had us make it for him.

555
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:18,750
Don't you see?

556
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:24,510
All right. I'm coming, too.

557
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:28,033
- No. This is for me to do.
- I'm not afraid.

558
01:27:28,233 --> 01:27:32,511
After all, I was a man, remember?

559
01:27:36,832 --> 01:27:39,393
Nunc... fax... incendere.

560
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,673
Stay close.

561
01:27:44,353 --> 01:27:46,312
- What's that?
- Nothing.

562
01:27:46,513 --> 01:27:49,473
- I want to see.
- No, you don't.

563
01:27:52,113 --> 01:27:54,194
All right. Wait here.

564
01:28:03,475 --> 01:28:05,635
Galen?

565
01:28:09,116 --> 01:28:10,516
Galen?

566
01:28:16,117 --> 01:28:18,357
Where are you?

567
01:28:28,519 --> 01:28:31,279
Ex favilla...

568
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:34,400
vita... nova!

569
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:06,210
Sic redit magnus ex terra mortuorum.

570
01:30:11,932 --> 01:30:13,892
You're back!

571
01:30:14,453 --> 01:30:18,973
- I thank the powers that made me.
- Glad to see you, too.

572
01:30:19,174 --> 01:30:23,213
You didn't bring along anything
to eat, by any chance?

573
01:30:23,413 --> 01:30:27,094
- Food?
- But come along. There's much to do.

574
01:30:27,295 --> 01:30:32,574
No, please...
I thought I was a sorcerer. I'm not.

575
01:30:33,654 --> 01:30:36,294
I thought I had power. I don't.

576
01:30:36,494 --> 01:30:38,854
You said to be strong. I wasn't.

577
01:30:39,095 --> 01:30:41,815
But you were, my boy. You were.

578
01:30:42,015 --> 01:30:43,974
And you'll be stronger yet.

579
01:30:46,216 --> 01:30:50,095
Thou art baptized in the name of
the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.

580
01:30:50,334 --> 01:30:54,536
And may the Lord lead us
from darkness and demons...

581
01:30:54,777 --> 01:30:56,537
Look!

582
01:31:49,782 --> 01:31:53,464
Draco... draconum.

583
01:32:04,945 --> 01:32:06,705
Galen!

584
01:32:12,547 --> 01:32:14,506
This is Valerian.

585
01:32:15,227 --> 01:32:17,187
I know. I remember.

586
01:32:18,227 --> 01:32:21,868
The girl who came to us as a boy.

587
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,149
There's something you must do.

588
01:32:26,748 --> 01:32:28,149
Anything.

589
01:32:29,787 --> 01:32:32,188
I want you to destroy the amulet...

590
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:38,028
...and me along with it.

591
01:32:45,429 --> 01:32:49,711
You brought me from the flames,
you must send me back.

592
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:53,392
You'll know the time.

593
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:58,272
You must act
while life is still in me.

594
01:33:42,477 --> 01:33:44,878
Tempestus!

595
01:33:51,278 --> 01:33:53,839
Imber!

596
01:34:17,603 --> 01:34:19,003
Fulmen!

597
01:34:33,164 --> 01:34:34,483
There.

598
01:35:44,492 --> 01:35:47,053
Here, Galen. Do what he said.

599
01:35:47,252 --> 01:35:50,052
Destroy the amulet. Smash it.

600
01:35:50,533 --> 01:35:53,334
No! He said I'd know the time.

601
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,619
- He told you to do it!
- Not yet!

602
01:38:04,509 --> 01:38:06,070
Galen!

603
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:41,041
Let us pray. We thank thee, Lord,
for this divine deliverance.

604
01:39:41,241 --> 01:39:45,121
Verily is thy presence
amongst us fully manifest

605
01:39:45,281 --> 01:39:47,642
in this, thy great work.

606
01:40:07,485 --> 01:40:09,446
Arise, children of the Lord.

607
01:40:10,686 --> 01:40:13,766
Forsake forever the pagan mysteries,

608
01:40:13,965 --> 01:40:16,687
the superstitions of the past.

609
01:40:16,848 --> 01:40:18,966
Rejoice in the power of God...

610
01:40:19,167 --> 01:40:22,967
All hail Casiodorus Rex -

611
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,129
Dragonslayer.

612
01:40:34,927 --> 01:40:38,288
- You miss Ulrich?
- Yes.

613
01:40:38,488 --> 01:40:41,368
- And the amulet?
- That, too.

614
01:40:41,929 --> 01:40:45,130
I don't. I'm glad it's gone.

615
01:40:45,329 --> 01:40:48,088
You may not be a sorcerer,
Galen Bradwardyn,

616
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:50,931
but that doesn't matter, not to me.

617
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:53,730
I know. I just wish...

618
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,971
- What?
- We had a horse.
