1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:12,240
Dragonslayer.1981.DVDRip.XviD-LnR

2
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,680
Unus in nihil...

3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Omnia in duos...

4
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Duo in unum...

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,000
Unum in nihil.

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,400
Nec quattuor...

7
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,920
nec omnia, nec unus, nec nihil sunt.

8
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,680
- Is this...?
- Yes, this is Cragganmore.

9
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, this is the house of Ulrich.
And no, he won't see you.

10
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,600
- But...
- I know. Your business is urgent.

11
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,840
It doesn't matter. He sees no one.

12
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,800
- Please...
- Please yourself. Go home.

13
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, what do we do now, boy?

14
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,440
You who knows so much,
answer me that.

15
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,760
Hear me,
you who dwell in Cragganmore.

16
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,240
Ulrich, we will stay here
until we are heard.

17
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,600
Magister?

18
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
- What is it?
- We have visitors.

19
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,560
I know.

20
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,720
- I will see them.
- You will?

21
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,880
Yes.

22
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,160
There's a great task
needing to be done.

23
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,760
I have been witness to something -
something of consequence to you.

24
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,080
- To me?
- Yes. My own death.

25
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
I knew it. Thieves.

26
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
Looks forbidding enough,
don't you think?

27
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
Oh, yes.

28
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,840
Master?

29
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,920
No. They'd think me infirm.

30
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,120
Balisarius wore this before he died.

31
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,640
You know, I actually
saw him change lead into gold.

32
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,040
I could never do that.
Mmm... Too bad.

33
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
You'd have stood
to inherit some real wealth.

34
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,120
Magister, please,
don't talk like that.

35
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,440
- You're not going to die.
- Oh, I look forward to it.

36
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,360
All this magic,
what has it accomplished?

37
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
Tell me, how are your studies going?

38
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,480
Fine. They're going well.

39
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,320
You still wish to be a sorcerer?

40
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,720
- Oh, yes. More than anything.
- Well, then, adeptus minor,

41
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,840
get yourself a handful
of that sulphurous ash over there.

42
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,440
Nunc habeamus lucem...

43
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,840
...et calorem.

44
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,080
Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich.

45
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,920
Which of you men
calls himself Valerian?

46
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,800
- We are here on behalf...
- I know why you're here.

47
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,200
You're a delegation from Urland,
which is beyond Dalvatia.

48
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,440
Let's see the artefacts.

49
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,840
Scales.

50
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,800
- How did you come by these?
- I found them

51
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,040
at the mouth of the lair.

52
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,200
What else?

53
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,000
- A claw.
- That's no claw, by the gods.

54
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,120
It's a tooth!
You want me to do battle with that?!

55
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,200
- Who else can we turn to?
- Did you try the Meredydd Sisters?

56
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,280
What about Rinbod?
I heard tell he killed a dragon once.

57
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,760
They're all dead.
You're the only one left.

58
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,080
It's a long way to Urland.

59
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Twice each year,
at the spring and autumn equinox,

60
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,320
the King selects
a new victim - virgins.

61
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,680
A lottery. Barbaric.

62
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,240
And in return, this dragon,

63
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,720
it leaves your villages
and crops unburned.

64
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,000
Your king
has made a pact with a monster.

65
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
- Master, don't you think...?
- Silence.

66
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,840
Are you afraid of dragons?

67
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,880
No.

68
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,000
In fact, if it weren't for sorcerers,
there wouldn't be any dragons.

69
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Once the skies were dotted with them.

70
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,880
Magnificent horned backs,
leather wings,

71
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,040
soaring in their hot-breath wind.

72
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,240
I know this creature of yours...

73
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,000
Vermithrax Pejorative.

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,920
Look at these scales, these ridges.

75
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,200
When a dragon gets this old,
it knows only pain, constant pain.

76
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,680
It grows decrepit, crippled...

77
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,080
pitiful... spiteful.

78
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
Will you help us?

79
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,640
Here. Good.

80
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Now let me go.

81
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,440
No...

82
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,320
No, not a bit too heavy.

83
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll conquer the highest mountain.
What say you, Galen?

84
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,280
Speak up, boy. Hodge?

85
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,760
Er... If you say so, sir.

86
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,120
When I've gone,
see you keep your nose in your books

87
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,960
and your hands out of my reagents.

88
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,440
How far can you get? A league? Two?

89
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm not worried about the road.

90
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,280
Tyrian.

91
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,200
Good morrow.

92
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,880
What do you want?

93
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,640
Young Master Valerian,

94
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,960
The question is,
what do you want so far from home?

95
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,880
We're not afraid of you.
Give us the road.

96
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,360
Why, the road is yours,
all the way to Urland.

97
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,760
It's a long journey, isn't it?

98
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,240
But when you're
in search of a sorcerer,

99
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,800
I suppose no distance is too great.

100
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,840
- Say nothing.
- Here's the mystical one himself.

101
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,080
You'd best keep your distance...
and your manners.

102
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,840
If he's ready to slay a dragon,
he's nothing to fear from me.

103
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,400
I've no more love for that creature
than you lot, nor has the King,

104
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,040
but before you stir things up,

105
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,200
don't you think you should find out
if he's the right man for the job?

106
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Ah! So it's a test you're
looking for? We don't do tests.

107
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,080
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

108
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,760
They never do tests.
Nor many real deeds.

109
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,880
Oh, conversation with your
grandmother's shade in a dark room,

110
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,800
the odd love potion,
but comes a doubter -

111
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,200
why, then it's the wrong day,
the planets aren't in line,

112
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,120
the entrails aren't favourable,
"We don't do tests".

113
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
We've got no doubts.
We require no tests.

114
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,040
- And you're not going to get one.
- Enough!

115
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,480
Here. Put this in the conjuring room.

116
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,320
Go to the iron box.
Bring me the dagger within.

117
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
The dagger. Be quick.

118
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,600
You shall have your test.

119
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,440
Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

120
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,520
- It's not this one, is it?
- The very one. Let it fall.

121
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,120
Mortem confundit magus.

122
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,400
- No! Stop him!
- Go on. Don't worry.

123
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,080
You can't hurt me.

124
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,440
Magical powers indeed.
Look at you now - magical ashes.

125
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,480
Hodge!

126
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,920
Hodge!

127
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,560
The kindest lord
a man could ever wish for.

128
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,920
Now he's gone.

129
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,320
Ye gods! You'd think he could boil
his own eggs at the snap of a finger,

130
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,680
but no, he had old Hodge to do it.

131
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,600
Up at five every morning, clearing
out the cages, emptying the slops.

132
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,600
Never a thank you
or a pat on the back.

133
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,080
I shall miss him.

134
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,720
- I do already.
- Oh, no, you don't.

135
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,680
All you think about
is your tricks and your knavery,

136
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,640
but you don't pull any wool
over these old eyes.

137
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,120
You'll have to walk far before
you fill his shoes, mark my words.

138
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,640
What's the matter, Hodge?
Pack too heavy?

139
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,360
No! Don't! Stop that! I need that!

140
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,880
Oh, give it back to me! This way!

141
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,240
I think you're too warm.

142
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,240
Stop it!
Out of respect for the master!

143
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,040
I have as much respect
for the master as anyone, old man,

144
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,280
but I'm master now.

145
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,240
I left my farm and for what?

146
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,320
For a cremation, that's what.

147
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,680
All because
someone said find a magician -

148
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,080
not a local fellow, an import,
some 100 leagues from home -

149
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,960
an all-powerful necromancer.

150
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Huh! That's some necromancer.

151
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,800
Hold your tongue, Griel. Eat.

152
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,960
I'll not eat. I'm not hungry.

153
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,400
He's right.
I brought us here for nothing.

154
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,080
What is it? Who's there?

155
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
Salvete, viatores!

156
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,000
Good morrow.
Good morrow. Peace be with you.

157
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,200
What do you want?

158
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
My lord Ulrich is no longer.

159
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,400
All that you asked of him,
you may now expect of me.

160
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,960
The dangers he would face,
I will now conquer.

161
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,280
The task he would undertake,
I will now fulfil.

162
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,760
I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor
of Ulrich's craft and knowledge...

163
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,400
and I am the sorcerer you seek.

164
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,560
Close enough. Bring her out.

165
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Now be it known throughout
the kingdom that this maiden,

166
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,240
having lawfully been chosen
by a deed of fortune and destiny,

167
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,680
shall hereby give up her life
for the greater good of Urland...

168
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,440
By this act shall be satisfied
the powers that dwell underground

169
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,080
and the spirits that attend thereto.

170
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,600
In gratitude for this sacrifice,

171
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,280
His Majesty declares the family
Plowman to be free of obligations

172
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
for a period
not to exceed five years.

173
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,040
Duly ordained!

174
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,680
What have you got there, Hodge?

175
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,320
- None of your business.
- Gold, eh?

176
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,600
- Shall I change it into lead?
- Save your jokes for someone else.

177
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,520
I do not care
for braggarts... or frauds.

178
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,440
- I'm no fraud.
- Fool, then.

179
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,400
Upstart. Whatever pleases you.

180
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,760
Look, Hodge,
nobody forced you to come along.

181
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,320
I came of my own
free will, all right.

182
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,280
We each do the Master's bidding
in our own way.

183
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,080
What are you doing? Don't come in!

184
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,960
- How's the water?
- It's cold.

185
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,440
I prefer to swim alone
if you don't mind.

186
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,880
Stay away!

187
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,280
- Look. Isn't that the...?
- Yes.

188
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,480
- The retainer from Cragganmore.
- Why is he here?

189
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,120
- Filling in for his chief.
- You going to allow that, sir?

190
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,440
Bring me my bow.

191
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,920
No, I'm not going to say anything.

192
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,240
I don't blame you.
I was careless. A silly woman.

193
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,040
Oh, I... I knew the moment I saw you.
I've known the whole time.

194
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,200
You never knew a thing.

195
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,200
No one's known, not since I was born.

196
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,000
The lottery.

197
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,280
- Daughters are chosen, sons are not.
- That's right.

198
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,440
- Unless you're the King's daughter.
- What do you mean?

199
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,080
If you're rich enough,
your name never goes in.

200
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,480
My father is poor.

201
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,160
So are a lot of fathers.

202
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
No!

203
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,240
No!

204
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,600
No!

205
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,560
Hodge!

206
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,160
Hodge!

207
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,160
Hodge.

208
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,080
- Galen, can you hear me?
- I hear you.

209
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,280
Do you know, somebody shot me,
but I can still talk.

210
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,560
There's something
that needs to be done.

211
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,080
- I know.
- No, no. Not the dragon.

212
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,240
The master's ashes. Here.

213
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,680
I'm sorry.
You'll have to peel it loose.

214
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,200
- Burning water!
- What?

215
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,520
Find the lake. Throw it in.

216
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,880
Hodge, what are you doing with this?

217
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,440
Burning... water.

218
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,720
Hodge, don't die.

219
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,400
Listen to me.
You're not going to die.

220
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,880
Urland.

221
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,440
Come on. Don't slow down here.

222
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,360
- Is the whole kingdom like this?
- No. We're near the lair.

223
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,000
The lair? Where is it?

224
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,160
- It doesn't matter.
- Show me. Where?

225
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,760
We're in no danger
if we just pass through quickly.

226
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,000
I want to see it.

227
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,120
Griel.

228
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,880
Malkin! Malkin!

229
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,320
- Are there other entrances?
- No. One's enough.

230
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,920
Don't be a fool! You'll provoke it!

231
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,560
How do you know it's in there?

232
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,400
Go on, then.
Get yourself burned alive.

233
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,440
What a fine trick that will be.

234
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,400
Vermithrax?

235
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,320
Tu saxum saxorum

236
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
in adversum montem operam da!

237
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,480
Inatibulum inquinatum draconis!

238
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,160
No! Consistete!

239
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,960
Redite... No!

240
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,520
Ascedete!

241
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,160
He's done it!

242
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,400
Put that away!

243
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,120
What if you were seen?

244
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,800
Musicians?

245
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,400
She was twice the man
of anyone in the village.

246
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,920
Now she's twice the woman.

247
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,080
Would that I was
as clever as her father.

248
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,720
Come, Griel.
Don't begrudge a life spared.

249
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,520
No, I... I begrudge nothing.

250
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,600
But I wonder at what we have seen...
and how it was done.

251
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,200
- You were there.
- Aye. And isn't it strange

252
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,720
that the very moment
that the beast was put down,

253
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,280
there should be a holy man
in the village?

254
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,440
Now, isn't that strange?

255
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,760
Could the Christian god
bring down a mountain?

256
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,840
- Is it possible, Father?
- Of course. Why not?

257
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,360
A celebration!
Well, don't stop on my account.

258
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,080
Musicians, more music.

259
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,440
A toast... to the deed of the day.

260
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,200
What would you have of us?

261
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,880
With you? Not a thing.

262
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,520
It's this one.

263
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,360
The King would meet
our new-found benefactor,

264
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,440
and offer his gratitude
to the one man who has succeeded

265
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,760
where so many have failed.

266
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,160
What sort of gratitude?

267
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,160
A knife in the belly?
An arrow in the chest?

268
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,360
My young friend, I would as soon
dispatch you as I did the rest,

269
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,360
and for the same reason,

270
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,320
but His Majesty would have a cosy
little chat and commands otherwise.

271
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,160
Behold. Eggs fit for a king.

272
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,280
All right...

273
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,520
How many of you
have ever seen a table fly?

274
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,800
None of you. None of you
have ever seen a table fly.

275
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,960
Stand back.

276
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,000
Heus... mensa... surge!

277
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,000
Surge mensa.

278
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,440
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Enough. That'll do.

279
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,360
- I can do this.
- It's not necessary.

280
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,800
Tell me, the landslide,
it was accomplished this same way?

281
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,320
Er... yes.

282
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,360
Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric?

283
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,280
Oh, no. Of course not.
You weren't even born.

284
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,720
He was my brother. A great king
and a valiant man-at-arms.

285
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,520
When he ascended the throne,
the dragon was unbridled.

286
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,440
No one knew where
it might strike next,

287
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,560
so he brought forth
his broadsword and his spear,

288
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,000
assembled his fighters
and went out to do battle.

289
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,680
He was never seen again,

290
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,200
but his attack provoked terrible
reprisals - villages incinerated,

291
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,800
entire crops burned, death, famine...

292
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,920
Horrible.

293
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,840
How did you arrogate
to yourself the role of saviour?

294
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,000
- I was invited.
- Not by me.

295
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,480
I think you're nothing
but a boy... an apprentice.

296
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,800
Have you considered
the consequences of failure?

297
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,480
What failure?
You want the dragon back?

298
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,160
You came here
and toyed with a monster!

299
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,480
Who are you
to risk our people, our villages?

300
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,040
- But your children were dying!
- Only a few.

301
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,320
It is better they die
that others might live.

302
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,600
I created the lottery - me -

303
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,800
and from the moment it began,
the dragon was tamed.

304
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,440
- The kingdom has prospered.
- At what price?

305
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,000
You can't make
a shameful peace with dragons.

306
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,280
- You must kill them as I have done.
- The beast is dead?

307
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,480
Yes, it's dead.

308
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,160
We shall see.

309
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,480
Caela... orrida... aperere.

310
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,600
Open up, I say! Caela orrida aperere!

311
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,120
Salve, magister juvenilis.

312
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,440
I studied Latin. Greek, too.

313
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,640
Me apellant Elspeth, filiam Regis.

314
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,360
Filiam Regis? You're his daughter.

315
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,880
Please don't think ill of us.

316
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,120
Father is a wise
and even-handed man. He's...

317
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,360
What happened to you?

318
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,200
Nothing. Just some
of the King's even-handedness.

319
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,800
It... It's better
for everyone this way.

320
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,960
A king must protect his people.

321
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Naturally.
Just as he protects his daughter.

322
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,640
What do you mean by that?

323
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,040
- Are you referring to the lottery?
- You know about the lottery?

324
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,400
I have participated in every
choosing since I came of age.

325
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,560
The whole kingdom knows that.

326
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,640
You don't have to pretend.
Not to me. Not down here.

327
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,920
Everyone knows
how this... choosing works -

328
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,240
the families
with money, royal connections...

329
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,040
You've participated
in a lie. You know it.

330
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,920
- I have to go now.
- You know I'm right.

331
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,120
Vale. Dorme bene.

332
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,400
Horsrik, remove all but one bar.
We'll try it one at a time.

333
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,600
- I, Casiodorus Rex...
- Father...

334
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,320
do some families pay bribes
to stay out of the lottery?

335
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,120
Nonsense.

336
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,120
By the power of this amulet,
justly wielded by my hand

337
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,560
in accordance
with the laws of Urland,

338
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,960
now, lead, be thou gold.

339
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,440
I'm burnt!

340
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,560
Have you ever kept
my name off the lottery list?

341
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,680
What are you suggesting?

342
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,840
Am I not exposed to the same risk
as other men's daughters?

343
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,160
There's been a loose tongue
here somewhere, sire.

344
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,640
- Where did you get such ideas?
- Answer my question.

345
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,160
Please... Don't think
of such things, I beg you.

346
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,200
- Answer me.
- The answer is no.

347
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,120
I mean yes. You are a participant.

348
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,360
We have seen to that.
How could we not?

349
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,040
Yes...

350
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,280
The answer is yes.

351
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,760
- You are lying to me.
- Elspeth!

352
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,760
Stay calm.

353
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,400
Go on.

354
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,400
You little meddler!

355
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,840
Stop him!

356
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,080
Close the gate!
What are you waiting for, idiots?

357
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,640
Stop him!

358
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,320
Tyrian!

359
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,840
In here! So much for your magic.
So much for your sorcery.

360
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,760
Feel that? It's alive.

361
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Listen to me. The moment of our fear
is the hour of our triumph.

362
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,720
This is a sign from God.

363
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,840
Horns, tail, wings
and clawed feet - this is no dragon.

364
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,000
This is Lucifer!

365
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,160
Dear Father, we beseech thee,

366
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,280
show us thy goodness
in this evil place.

367
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,480
Show us thy power.

368
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,320
Cursed worm, a devil flung
from Heaven will now rise from Hell!

369
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,200
Stay and fear the word of God!

370
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,320
You call yourselves Christians?!

371
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,880
Fear not, brethren.
There is no dragon.

372
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,480
Unclean beast! Get thee down!

373
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,600
Be thou consumed
by the fires that made thee!

374
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,160
- Where is he?
- Not here. Can't help you.

375
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,640
As the proud new father of a daughter

376
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,320
who has somehow
been overlooked all these years,

377
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,240
it may interest you to know
the King has called a new lottery.

378
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,400
It's months to the solstice.

379
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,640
In view of what's happened,
we all know what's required.

380
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,880
I've never taken part
in your cursed lottery. I won't now.

381
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,200
You were very clever, but
she will take part like all the rest.

382
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,840
No exceptions.

383
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,000
- I want to be in it.
- Silence, child.

384
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,880
I'm no different to any other girl.
My name will go in.

385
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,840
Nothing.
If he was here, he's gone now.

386
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,960
Blacksmith,
have you ever forged a weapon?

387
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,920
This is "Secarius draconum" - 
Dragonslayer.

388
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,920
- The best I ever made.
- It's beautiful.

389
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,680
But I never had the nerve to use it.

390
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,520
That won't help. What you want
to kill isn't flesh and blood.

391
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,400
- It'll bleed.
- How do you know?

392
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,720
- No one's so much as scratched it.
- She's right. I'll need the amulet.

393
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,960
Stir the tiles!

394
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,440
Stir the tiles!

395
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,720
Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

396
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,040
Draw the name! Draw the name!

397
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,240
Draw the name!

398
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,320
Draw the name!

399
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,560
Draw the name!

400
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,400
Now, my countrymen, hear me.

401
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,280
Behold, for I am chosen.

402
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,960
I shall die that many may live.

403
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,000
I shall lay down my life
for family and fellows.

404
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:51,720
I shall go to my grave for the love
of our king and his wise policy.

405
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,840
And my name is...

406
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,560
- Read the name!
- Read the name!

407
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,000
Read the name!

408
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,680
Read the name! Read the name!

409
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,200
Read the name.

410
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,960
The name
is Princess Elspeth Ulfilas...

411
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,720
...filia Regis.

412
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,680
That is not the name.
It has been misread.

413
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,080
There's no mistake.
The name's been drawn. Let it stand.

414
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,120
No. The good Horsrik
has misspoke himself.

415
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,560
In fairness to this individual,
we will destroy this tile.

416
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,080
No!

417
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,440
No. What better name
than your own kin?

418
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,680
- At last, we see justice done.
- Silence!

419
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,840
We will have a new choosing.

420
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,720
I will draw the name myself.

421
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,680
Let it stand! Let it stand!

422
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,600
The name is as Horsrik read it...

423
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,720
Elspeth.

424
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,440
And this one... And another...

425
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,280
Another... And another...

426
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,240
And another. What treachery is this?

427
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,640
- The lottery is invalid.
- Hear me, good people.

428
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,880
It is true that my name
appears on all the lots.

429
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,480
This does not invalidate
the lottery, it certifies it.

430
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,640
It redresses an injustice.

431
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,440
I have learned that my name was kept
from jeopardy in all past drawings.

432
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,280
Therefore, I have substituted
my name for yours

433
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:04,040
for the risk that over the years
you have taken and I have not.

434
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,120
You, Tyrian.
Surely you'll do something.

435
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,360
If not for me,
out of loyalty to the kingdom.

436
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,120
But that's just it, Your Majesty.

437
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,200
My first duty
is loyalty to the kingdom.

438
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,320
Don't go to all that trouble.

439
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,240
If you want a fight,
give me a weapon.

440
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,000
- I think not.
- Stop!

441
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,440
Don't harm him.

442
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,520
And... you, please...

443
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,480
I'm a great admirer
of the black arts.

444
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:38,360
You chaps
with your... mysterious spells.

445
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,600
I didn't think it would be necessary.
Vermithrax is an old dragon.

446
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,240
That, I thought,
was the beauty of my plan - time.

447
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,920
We'd wait it out.
I'd live to see the end of it...

448
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,040
I will see the end of it.

449
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,400
Sire, consider what you are doing.

450
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,640
Give him that,
he'll destroy all you've built.

451
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,040
He shall have it.

452
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,240
It's my daughter.

453
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,800
Save her, I beg you.

454
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:34,240
The princess - what's her name? -

455
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,560
Elspeth. Her name's Elspeth.

456
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,760
There, good and hot.

457
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,800
That's not the kind of fire we need.

458
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,840
Nunc per potestatem

459
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,920
hermeticum ex flammis,

460
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,640
ferrum sanguinarium.

461
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,560
Good. Now turn it over.

462
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,040
An edge like no other on this earth.

463
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,560
I'll say goodbye to her for you.

464
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,880
Sorry she's not here.
You know how she is.

465
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,040
I understand.

466
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,600
Fare thee well.

467
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,400
It's a shield. I made it.

468
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,640
It might keep the fire
off you, it might not.

469
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,160
You know, you're an idiot.

470
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,440
You're going to die tonight.
You'll be ripped limb from limb.

471
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,840
This is the last time
I'll ever speak to you.

472
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,480
- Thank you.
- Another thing...

473
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,600
I've been up there.

474
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,760
That thing isn't alone.

475
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,200
It's got little ones. Young, I think.

476
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,520
- I don't know how many.
- They must be killed, too.

477
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
Anything else?

478
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,280
You're in love, aren't you?

479
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,560
Yes.

480
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,520
It's all right.

481
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,040
I understand.

482
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,040
She's very beautiful, very brave.

483
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,160
Who is? What do you mean?

484
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,320
Your princess.

485
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,400
But I don't care.

486
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,200
Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn,

487
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,440
sorcerer's apprentice...

488
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,040
you're going to be dead...

489
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,760
the dragon will be worse than ever,

490
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,480
there will be more lotteries...
and I'm not a boy any more.

491
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,480
- And you'll be eligible because...
- Because I'm still a virgin.

492
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,080
I am in love...

493
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,880
...but not with the Princess.

494
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,080
Your Highness?

495
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,000
Now be it known throughout
the kingdom that Princess Elspeth,

496
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,480
having lawfully been chosen
by a deed of fortune and destiny...

497
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,720
No more smoke, I beg you.

498
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,240
Begone!

499
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,440
I declare these proceedings...

500
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,920
duly ordained!

501
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,080
I knew I'd find you here.

502
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,240
Well, I'm not
as sentimental as His Majesty.

503
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,720
The kingdom, every one of us,
needs this sacrifice.

504
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,880
If you intend to interfere...

505
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,920
you'll have to kill me.

506
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,160
I've plenty of reasons to kill you
that have nothing to do with this.

507
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,320
Most impressive.

508
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,280
- Can you use it?
- No! Stop!

509
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,360
Tyrian is right!
This is our only hope!

510
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,000
Tyrian!

511
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,080
This is no warrior.

512
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,640
Run!

513
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,960
Run!

514
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,960
Where are you going?

515
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,840
You've failed, my friend...
and I thank the gods for it.

516
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,920
Now prepare yourself...

517
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,040
Elspeth.

518
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,680
It's still alive.

519
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,960
You know what we have to do.

520
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,040
We have to leave.

521
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,800
You said you loved me.

522
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,960
Is it true?

523
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,360
If it is...

524
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,960
it's the only good we've done.

525
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,160
Let's not lose that, too.

526
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,480
Galen?

527
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,480
She's right. What kind
of life could you have here?

528
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,680
You know what I think?

529
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,360
Magic, magicians -
it's all fading from the world.

530
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,040
Dying out. That makes me happy.

531
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,120
That means
the dragon will be dying, too.

532
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,280
Valerian.

533
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,040
Something from your father.

534
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,680
You want me to wear this?

535
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,520
What harm can it do?

536
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,200
What is it?

537
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,160
What's the matter?

538
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,000
What is that?

539
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,280
Look.

540
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,160
- At what?
- There.

541
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,000
That old trickster.
The burning water.

542
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,880
The lake of fire.

543
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,160
He had it planned...
from the beginning.

544
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,520
He knew this was going to happen.

545
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,440
Who did? What happened?

546
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:46,280
We've got to go back.
I have to talk to him.

547
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,000
Where are you going?

548
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,800
We can slay this dragon with prayer.

549
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,240
If we but join together in faith,

550
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:04,760
we shall live,
and the beast shall die.

551
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,120
Galen, stop!
I won't let you kill yourself.

552
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:15,920
He couldn't make the journey,
so he had us make it for him.

553
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,080
Don't you see?

554
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,840
All right. I'm coming, too.

555
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,360
- No. This is for me to do.
- I'm not afraid.

556
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,840
After all, I was a man, remember?

557
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,720
Nunc... fax... incendere.

558
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,000
Stay close.

559
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,640
- What's that?
- Nothing.

560
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,800
- I want to see.
- No, you don't.

561
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,520
All right. Wait here.

562
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,960
Galen?

563
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,840
Galen?

564
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,680
Where are you?

565
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,600
Ex favilla...

566
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,720
vita... nova!

567
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:05,520
Sic redit magnus ex terra mortuorum.

568
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,200
You're back!

569
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,280
- I thank the powers that made me.
- Glad to see you, too.

570
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,520
You didn't bring along anything
to eat, by any chance?

571
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:26,400
- Food?
- But come along. There's much to do.

572
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:31,880
No, please...
I thought I was a sorcerer. I'm not.

573
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,600
I thought I had power. I don't.

574
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,160
You said to be strong. I wasn't.

575
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,120
But you were, my boy. You were.

576
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,280
And you'll be stronger yet.

577
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,400
Thou art baptised in the name of
the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.

578
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:53,840
And may the Lord lead us
from darkness and demons...

579
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,840
Look!

580
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,760
Draco... draconum.

581
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,000
Galen!

582
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,800
This is Valerian.

583
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,480
I know. I remember.

584
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,160
The girl who came to us as a boy.

585
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,440
There's something you must do.

586
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,440
Anything.

587
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,480
I want you to destroy the amulet...

588
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,320
...and me along with it.

589
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:49,000
You brought me from the flames,
you must send me back.

590
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,680
You'll know the time.

591
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,560
You must act
while life is still in me.

592
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,160
Tempestus!

593
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,120
Imber!

594
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,280
Fulmen!

595
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,760
There.

596
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,320
Here, Galen. Do what he said.

597
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,320
Destroy the amulet. Smash it.

598
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,600
No! He said I'd know the time.

599
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,880
- He told you to do it!
- Not yet!

600
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,320
Galen!

601
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:40,280
Let us pray. We thank thee, Lord,
for this divine deliverance.

602
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:44,360
Verily is thy presence
amongst us fully manifest

603
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,880
in this, thy great work.

604
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,680
Arise, children of the Lord.

605
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,000
Forsake forever the pagan mysteries,

606
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,920
the superstitions of the past.

607
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,200
Rejoice in the power of God...

608
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:22,200
All hail Casiodorus Rex -

609
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,360
Dragonslayer.

610
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,520
- You miss Ulrich?
- Yes.

611
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,600
- And the amulet?
- That, too.

612
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,360
I don't. I'm glad it's gone.

613
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,320
You may not be a sorcerer,
Galen Bradwardyn,

614
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,160
but that doesn't matter, not to me.

615
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,960
I know. I just wish...

616
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,200
- What?
- We had a horse.
