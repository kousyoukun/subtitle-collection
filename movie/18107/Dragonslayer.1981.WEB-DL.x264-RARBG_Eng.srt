Get-get back.

25
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,609
Oh...

26
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:25,675
(<i> muttering</i> )

27
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:27,815
Is this...

28
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,389
Yes! This is Cragganmore,

29
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:32,017
and yes, this is
the house of Ulrich,

30
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:34,222
and no, he
won't see you.

31
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:35,574
But...

32
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:36,924
I know-- you've
come a long way.

33
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,226
Your business is urgent.

34
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,587
It doesn't matter.

35
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,855
He sees no one.

36
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,262
Please.
Please

37
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,703
yourself.

38
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,697
Go home.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,470
Well, what do we
do now,<i> boy?</i>

40
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,210
You who know so much--
answer me that.

41
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:02,307
Hear me, you who dwell
in Cragganmore!

42
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:08,223
Ulrich, we will stay here
until we are heard!

43
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:13,785
(<i> water dripping</i> )

44
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,331
Magister?

45
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,472
Uh.

46
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,137
What is it?

47
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,911
W-We have visitors.

48
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,639
(<i> water drips</i> )

49
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:43,644
I know.

50
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:45,006
I will see them.

51
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,084
You will?

52
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:48,212
Yes.

53
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:52,446
There's a great task
needing to be done.

54
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:55,723
I have been witness
to something.

55
00:04:55,722 --> 00:05:00,662
Something of
consequence to you.

56
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:01,759
To me?

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,930
Yes.

58
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,388
My own death.

59
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:11,228
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Yeah, yeah, I knew it.

60
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,334
Thieves.

61
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:15,295
(<i> muttering</i> )

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,970

00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,975
(<i> squawking</i> )

64
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:32,923
Looks forbidding enough,
don't you think?

65
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,817
Oh, yes.

66
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,148
Master?

67
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,393
No.

68
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:42,517
They'd think me infirm.

69
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:47,733
Bellasarius wore this
before<i> he</i> died.

70
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:54,297
You know, I actually saw him
change lead into gold.

71
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,127
I could never do that.

72
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,425
Hmm. Too bad.

73
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,766
You'd have stood
to inherit some<i> real</i> wealth.

74
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:05,312
Magister, please don't talk
like that.

75
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,208
You're not going to die.

76
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,139
Oh, but I look forward to it.

77
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,875
All this magic--

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,180
what has it accomplished?

79
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,923
Tell me,
how are your studies going?

80
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,619
(<i> bird squawking</i> )

81
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,090
Fine.

82
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,318
They're going well.

83
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:25,422
You still wish
to be a sorcerer?

84
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:27,315
Oh, yes, more
than anything.

85
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:30,086
Hmm. Well, then...
(<i> speaks Latin</i> )

86
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:35,865
get yourself a handful of that
sulphurous ash over there.

87
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:59,585
(<i> vibrating whir</i> )

88
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,430
(<i> chants spell</i> )

89
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,074
(<i> flames roaring</i> )

90
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,148
Welcome to Cragganmore.

91
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,550
I am Ulrich.

92
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:38,551
Which of you men
calls himself Valerian?

93
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,686
We are here on behalf...

94
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,960
I know why you are here.

95
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,588
You're a delegation...

96
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:50,092
from Urland,
which is beyond Valvasia.

97
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,733
Let's see the artifacts.

98
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,378
Scales.

99
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,780
How did you come by these?

100
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,582
I found them

101
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:15,722
at the mouth
of the lair.

102
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,177
What else?

103
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,085
A claw.

104
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,990
That's no claw, by the Gods.

105
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,562
It's a tooth.

106
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,760
You want me to do battle
with that?

107
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,303
Who else can we turn to?

108
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:37,468
Did you... did you try
the Merydid sisters?

109
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,367
What about Rimbog?

110
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:42,397
I-I heard tell he
killed a dragon once.

111
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,004
They're all dead.

112
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,835
You're the only one left.

113
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,110
It is a long way to Urland.

114
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:56,782
Twice each year, at the spring
and autumn equinox,

115
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:59,282
the king selects a new victim--

116
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,024
virgins.

117
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,119
A lottery.

118
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,121
Barbaric.

119
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,992
And in return,
this dragon--

120
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,290
it leaves your villages
and crops unburned.

121
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,264
Your king's

122
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,532
made a pact
with a monster.

123
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,330
Master, don't you think that...

124
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:19,331
Silence.

125
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,773
Are you afraid of dragons?

126
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:25,243
No.

127
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:27,137
In fact, if it weren't
for sorcerers,

128
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,998
there wouldn't
be any dragons.

129
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:32,136
Once the skies were
dotted with them.

130
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:37,382
Magnificent horned backs,
leathern wings, soaring,

131
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,910
in their hot breath wind.

132
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:43,845
Oh, I know this
creature of yours--

133
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,585
Vermithrax Pejorative.

134
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,717
Look at these scales,
these ridges.

135
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:52,863
When a dragon gets this old,

136
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:57,558
it knows nothing but pain,
constant pain.

137
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:01,702
He grows decrepit, crippled...

138
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:03,628
pitiful...

139
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:06,873
spiteful.

140
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:10,239
Will you help us?

141
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,398
There.

142
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:13,296
Good.

143
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:15,806
Now, let-let me go.

144
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,438
Hmm.

145
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,912
No.

146
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,710
No, not...

147
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,681
not a bit too heavy.

148
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,709
I'll...
conquer the highest mountain.

149
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,745
What say you, Galen?

150
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,880
Speak up, boy.

151
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:33,945
Hodge?

152
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:37,652
Uh, if you say so, sir.

153
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,344
When I've gone,

154
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,118
see you keep your nose
in your books

155
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:45,894
and your hands out
of my reagents.

156
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,963
How far can
you get?

157
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,361
A league

158
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:52,062
or two?

159
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,763
I'm not worried about the road.

160
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:58,895
Tyrian.

161
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,003
(<i> bird shrieks</i> )

162
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,135
Good morrow.

163
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,971
(<i> wind whistling</i> )

164
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,806
VALERIAN:
What do you want?

165
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,541
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
No...

166
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,906
young master Valerian.

167
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,514
The question is,
what do<i> you</i> want

168
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,476
so far from home?

169
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,324
We're not afraid of you.

170
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,519
Give us the road.

171
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,490
Why, the road is yours,

172
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,688
all the way to Urland.

173
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,220
It's a long journey, isn't it?

174
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:27,834
But when you're in search
of a sorcerer,

175
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:31,227
I suppose
no distance is too great.

176
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,289
Say nothing.

177
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:35,596
TYRIAN:
And here, we
have the mystical

178
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,629
presence himself.

179
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:38,233
You best keep your distance.

180
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,874
And your manners.

181
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,768
If he's ready to lay
a dragon in its grave,

182
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,170
he's nothing
to fear from me.

183
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,913
I've no more love
for that creature than you lot.

184
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,310
Nor has the king.

185
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,412
But...

186
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,053

370
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,289
How's the water?

371
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:51,317
It's cold.

372
00:27:55,695 --> 00:28:00,825
I prefer to swim alone,
if you don't mind.

373
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:10,672
Stay away.

374
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,982
Look, Sire,
isn't that...?

375
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,250
Yes.

376
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,507
The old retainer
from Cragganmore.

377
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:21,605
What's he
doing here?

378
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,816
Filling in
for his chief, I reckon.

379
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:27,788
Are you going to
allow that, sir?

380
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:33,117
Bring me my bow.

381
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:39,657
No, I'm not going
to say anything.

382
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:41,634
I don't blame you.

383
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,632
I was careless.

384
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,434
A silly woman!

385
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:47,665
Oh. I-I knew
the moment I saw you.

386
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,200
I've known
the whole time.

387
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,735
You never knew a thing.

388
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,310
No one's known.

389
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:57,378
Not since I was born.

390
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:59,607
The lottery--

391
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,112
daughters are chosen,
sons are not.

392
00:29:03,115 --> 00:29:05,325
That's right.

393
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,553
Unless you happen
to be the daughter of the king.

394
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:10,072
What do you mean?

395
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,590
If you're rich enough,
your name never goes in.

396
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:17,230
My father is poor.

397
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:20,357
So are a lot of fathers.

398
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:31,766
(<i> wings fluttering loudly</i> )

399
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:08,413
(<i> hooves pounding</i> )

400
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,223
No!

401
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,848
No!

402
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:26,588
No!

403
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,724
Hodge!

404
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:33,326
Hodge!

405
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:38,233
Hodge.

406
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,134
(<i> moaning softly</i> )

407
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:46,265
Galen, can you hear me?

408
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:47,671
I hear you.

409
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:51,142
Do you know
somebody shot me,

410
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,882
but I can still talk.

411
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:56,307
There's something
that needs to be done.

412
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,113
I know.

413
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,653
No, no, not the dragon.

414
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:02,278
The Master's ashes!

415
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,223
Here!

416
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:04,918
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:08,018
You'll have to
peel it loose.

418
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,691
(<i> moans</i> )

419
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:12,119
Burning water.

420
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:13,594
What?

421
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:15,892
Find the lake.

422
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:17,294
Throw it in.

423
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:20,355
Hodge, what are you
doing with this?

424
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:24,204
Burning... water.

425
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,970
Hodge, don't die.

426
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,099
Listen to me.

427
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:31,773
You're not going
to die.

428
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:36,472
(<i> chanting spell</i> )

429
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:39,306
(<i> sizzling, gasps</i> )

430
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:52,115
Urland.

431
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:06,917
Come on.

432
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,194
Don't slow down here.

433
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:10,161
Is the whole
kingdom like this?

434
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,729
No. We're near
the lair.

435
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,558
The lair?

436
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:16,703
Where is it?

437
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,357
Doesn't matter.

438
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:19,655
Show me.

439
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,796
Where?

440
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:22,801
We're in no danger,

441
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:25,102
if we just pass
though quickly.

442
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,544
I want to see it.

443
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,669
(<i> rumbling</i> )

444
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:31,643
Greil!

445
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:41,124
Taffiet! Taffiet!

446
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,779
Are there other entrances?

447
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:14,711
No.

448
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:17,545
One's enough.

449
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,163
Don't be a fool!

450
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,987
You'll provoke it!

451
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:31,563
How do you know it's in there?

452
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,400
VALERIAN:
Go on, then.

453
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,431
Get yourself
burned alive.

454
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:42,566
What a fine trick that will be.

455
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:50,305
(<i> bones creaking</i> )

456
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:14,327
(<i> low rumbling</i> )

457
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:33,918
(<i> loud roar</i> )

458
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:35,528
Vermithrax.

459
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:37,145
(<i> echoing</i> ):
...thrax... thrax... thrax...

460
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,163
(<i> rumbling growl</i> )

(<i> chanting spell</i> )

465
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,370
No!

466
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,697
(<i> yelling spell</i> )

467
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:51,341
(<i> small rocks falling</i> )

468
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,591
That's a wizard.

469
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,361
He's done it!

470
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:24,336
(<i> people shouting and laughing</i> )

471
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:27,541
(<i> music playing</i> )

00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:40,492
(<i> cheering</i> )

(<i> laughing</i> )

(<i> exclamations of delight</i> )

475
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,562
Put that away.

476
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:27,396
What if you were seen?

477
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:33,267
(<i> laughing and talking</i> )

478
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,040
(<i> all grow silent</i> )

479
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:27,017
Musicians.

480
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:36,025
(<i> playing medieval dance tune</i> )

481
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:09,594
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

482
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,669
The damnedest thing
is she was twice the man

483
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:20,337
of anyone else in the village,
and now she's twice the woman.

484
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:24,907
Would that I was as
clever as her father.

485
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,642
Come now, Greil,

486
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:29,513
don't begrudge
a life spared.

487
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:33,511
No, I... I
begrudge nothing.

488
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:37,284
But I... I wonder
at what we have seen

489
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,124
and how it was done.

490
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,049
You were there.
Aye.

491
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:43,374
But isn't it strange?

492
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:45,692
At the very moment that
the beast was put down,

493
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:49,391
there should be a holy
man in the village.

494
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:51,164
Now, isn't that strange?

495
00:42:51,162 --> 00:42:52,732
(<i> music playing, laughing</i> )

496
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,700
(<i> dog barking</i> )

497
00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:01,802
Could the Christian God
bring down a whole mountain?

498
00:43:01,805 --> 00:43:02,695
Is it possible, Father?

499
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,265
Of course it is, my
son-- and why not?

500
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:22,586
(<i> music stops</i> )

501
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:41,869
A celebration.

502
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:47,683
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Well, don't stop
on my account.

503
00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:51,405
Musicians...

504
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:54,084
more music.

505
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:57,677
A toast...

506
00:43:57,684 --> 00:44:01,094
To the deed
of the day!

507
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:04,051
GREIL:
What would

508
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:05,985
you have of us?

509
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,690
With you?

510
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:09,621
Not a thing.

511
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:12,926
It's this one.

512
00:44:14,596 --> 00:44:18,726
The king would meet our
new-found benefactor

513
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:20,303
and offer his gratitude

514
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:22,401
to the one man
who has succeeded

515
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:26,913
where so many
have failed.

516
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:29,667
What sort of gratitude?

517
00:44:29,676 --> 00:44:31,676
A knife in the belly?

518
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:33,438
Arrow in the chest?

519
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:35,646
My young friend,

520
00:44:35,648 --> 00:44:39,448
I would as soon dispatch
you as I did the rest,

521
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,150
and for the
same reason...

522
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:45,592
but His Majesty would
have a cozy little chat

523
00:44:45,588 --> 00:44:48,658
and commands otherwise.

524
00:44:48,657 --> 00:44:50,957
(<i> chickens squawking</i> )
Hyah!

525
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:02,369
Behold! Eggs fit for a king!

00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:06,039
(<i> clears throat</i> )

527
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:08,488
Right.

528
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:10,939
How many of you
have ever seen a table fly?

529
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,161
None of you.

530
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,379
None of you have ever seen
a table fly.

531
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:18,148
Stand back.

532
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:25,145
(<i> chants spell</i> )

533

(<i> sighs</i> )

536
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,740
Sorry, sorry.

537
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:54,894
Sorry.

538
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:56,044
KING:
Now, that'll do.
I really can do this.

539
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,375
Don't bother,
it's not necessary.

540
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,010
Tell me-- the landslide--

541
00:46:00,014 --> 00:46:04,224
it was accomplished
this same way?

542
00:46:04,218 --> 00:46:05,768
Uh, yes.

543
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:07,318
Did you ever hear
of King Gazerick?

544
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,320
Oh, no, of course not--
you weren't even born.

545
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:12,723
He was my brother...

546
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:14,524
a great king

547
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,485
and a valiant man-at-arms.

548
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:19,993
When he ascended the throne,
the dragon was unbridled.

549
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:22,826
No one knew
where it might strike next,

550
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:26,302
so he brought forth
his broadsword and his spear,

551
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:28,772
assembled his best company
of fighters,

552
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:31,901
and went out to do battle.

553
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,535
He was never seen again...

554
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,883
but his attack provoked
the most terrible reprisals--

555
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:41,979
whole villages incinerated,

556
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:44,551
entire crops burnt...

557
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,280
death, famine.

558
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:53,054
Horrible.

559
00:46:54,524 --> 00:46:55,824
How did you...

560
00:46:55,825 --> 00:46:59,725
arrogate to yourself
the role of savior?

561
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:03,428
I was invited.
Not by me.

562
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:09,533
I think you're
nothing but a boy.

563
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:13,139
An apprentice.

564
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:16,568
Have you ever considered

565
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:18,873
the consequences
of failure?

566
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,465
What failure?!

567
00:47:20,475 --> 00:47:22,065
What are you saying--
you want the dragon back?

568
00:47:22,077 --> 00:47:24,637
You came in
and toyed with a monster!

569
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:26,846
Who are you
to risk our people?!

570
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:29,648
Our villages?!
But your children
were dying!

571
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,620
Only a few-- does
that sound cruel?

572
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:35,718
It is better that
they should die that
others might live.

573
00:47:35,721 --> 00:47:37,421
I created the lottery.

574
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:38,722
(<i> all agree</i> )
Me.

575
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,593
And from the moment
it began,

576
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,291
the dragon was tame.

577
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:46,762
A kingdom has prospered.
At what price?

578
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:49,162
You...

579
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:51,563
You can't make
a shameful peace with dragons.

580
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:54,496
You must kill them
as I have done.

581
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:57,542
Then the beast is dead?

582
00:47:58,572 --> 00:48:01,072
Yes, it's dead.

583
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,941
We shall see.

584
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:10,249
(<i> rumbling</i> )

585
00:48:35,005 --> 00:48:37,335
(<i> hissing</i> )

586
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:49,024
(<i> chanting spell</i> )

587
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,450
Open up, I say!

588
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:57,154
(<i> chanting spell</i> )

589
00:48:57,156 --> 00:49:00,456
(<i> woman speaking Latin</i> )

590
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:03,826
I've studied Latin.

591
00:49:03,828 --> 00:49:05,458
Greek, too.

592
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:09,262
(<i> speaking Latin</i> )

593
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:13,065
(<i> speaking Latin</i> )

594
00:49:13,068 --> 00:49:14,898
You're his daughter.

595
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:17,343
Please don't think ill of us.

596
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:21,368
Father is a wise
and evenhanded man.

597
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,805
He's...

598
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,909
What happened to you?

599
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:27,511
Nothing.

600
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:30,112
Just some of the king's...
evenhandedness.

601
00:49:30,115 --> 00:49:33,275
It... it's better for everyone
this way.

602
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:36,724
A king must protect his people.

603
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,790
Naturally.

604
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:41,487
Just as he protects
his daughter.

605
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:46,289
What do you mean by that?

606
00:49:46,294 --> 00:49:47,764
(<i> sighs</i> )

607
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:50,732
Are you referring
to the lottery?

608
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:52,731
You know about the lottery.

609
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:56,833
I have participated
in every choosing

610
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:58,696
since I came of age.

611
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,974
The whole kingdom knows that.

612
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:03,312
You don't have to pretend.

613
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:07,407
Not to me-- not down here.

614
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:13,450
Everyone knows how this....
choosing works.

615
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:18,878
The families with money,
royal connections.

616
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:23,415
You've participated in a lie,
you know it.

617
00:50:23,422 --> 00:50:25,162
I have to go now.

618
00:50:25,157 --> 00:50:26,987
You know I'm right!

619
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:29,632
(<i> speaking Latin</i> )

620
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:33,997
(<i> loud rumbling echoes</i> )

621
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:38,471
(<i> rumbling, crackling</i> )

622
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:41,967
(<i> low growling</i> )

623
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:43,099
Possibly.

624
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:44,243
Remove all but one bar.

625
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:47,397
We'll try it one at a time.

626
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:54,876
I, Casiodorus Rex,
do hereby...
Father!

627
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:55,878
Did you know

628
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:56,878
that some families
have paid bribes

629
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,780
to stay out of
the lottery?

630
00:50:58,781 --> 00:51:00,411
Nonsense.

631
00:51:00,415 --> 00:51:03,945
By the power
of this amulet,

632
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:05,351
justly wielded by my hand

633
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:08,122
in accordance
with the laws of Urland,

634
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:11,191
now lead, be thou gold.

635
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,190
(<i> sizzling</i> )

636
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:13,561
(<i> screams</i> )

637
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,759
I'm burnt!

638
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,960
Have you ever kept my name
off the lottery list?

639
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:19,103
Lottery list?

640
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:20,097
What are you suggesting?

641
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:22,098
Am I not exposed
to the same risk

642
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,800
as every other man's daughter?

643
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:27,301
There's been a
loose tongue here
somewhere, Sire.

644
00:51:27,304 --> 00:51:29,974
Who fills your head
with such ideas?

645
00:51:29,973 --> 00:51:31,743
Answer my question.

646
00:51:31,741 --> 00:51:33,911
Please... (<i> sighs</i> )

647
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:36,009
don't...
think of such things,

648
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:37,081
I beg you.

649
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:38,178
Answer me.

650
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,179
The answer is no.

651
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,681
I-I mean yes.

652
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,181
Yes. You are a participant
in the choosing.

653
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,023
We have seen to that,
of course.

654
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,548
How could we not?

655
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:49,492
Yes.

656
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:53,218
The answer is yes.

657
00:51:54,225 --> 00:51:56,055
You're lying to me.

658
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,530

is this?

The lottery is invalid.

Hear me, good people.

854
01:05:15,977 --> 01:05:19,977
It is true that my name
appears on all the lots.

855

This does not
invalidate the lottery.

856

It certifies it.

857
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:28,291
It redresses
an injustice.

01:05:28,287 --> 01:05:29,247
I have learnt

at least give me a weapon.

01:11:14,323 --> 01:11:16,163
You know how she is.

919
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:18,858
I understand.

920
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:23,828
Fare thee well.

921
01:11:24,298 --> 01:11:26,968
(<i> sighs</i> )

922
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:35,836
(<i> raptor calling</i> )

923
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:41,309
VALERIAN:
It's a shield.

924
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,781
I made it.

925
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:47,309
It might keep the fire
off you; it might not.

926
01:11:47,948 --> 01:11:50,108
You know,
you're an idiot.

927
01:11:50,116 --> 01:11:52,446
You're going
to die tonight.

928
01:11:52,451 --> 01:11:54,751
You'll be ripped
limb from limb.

929
01:11:54,753 --> 01:11:59,353
This is the last time
I'll ever speak to you.

930
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,791
Thank you.

931
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:05,092
Another thing.

932
01:12:05,094 --> 01:12:08,034
I've been up there.

933
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,460
That thing isn't alone.

934
01:12:10,465 --> 01:12:12,725
It's got little ones.

935
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:14,003
Young, I think.

936
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,300
I don't know
how many.

937
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:17,731
They'll have to be killed, too.

938
01:12:17,736 --> 01:12:19,996
Anything else?

939
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:30,477
You're in love,
aren't you?

940
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,881
Yes.

941
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:39,151
It's all right.

942
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:42,094
I understand.

943
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,890
She's very beautiful.

944
01:12:44,892 --> 01:12:46,462
Very brave.

945
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:49,030
Who is? What do you mean?

946
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:51,799
Your princess.

947
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:57,503
But I don't care.

948
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:07,314
Listen to me, Galen Brandwardyn,
sorcerer's apprentice.

949
01:13:07,311 --> 01:13:10,181
You're going to be dead...

950
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,250
the dragon
will be worse than ever,

951
01:13:13,249 --> 01:13:16,719
there will be more lotteries...

952
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,589
and I'm not a boy anymore.

953
01:13:18,587 --> 01:13:21,047
And you'll be eligible
because...

954
01:13:21,056 --> 01:13:23,856
Because I'm still a virgin.

955
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:43,174
I<i> am</i> in love...

956
01:13:47,413 --> 01:13:50,453
...but not
with the princess.

957
01:14:31,256 --> 01:14:33,456
Your Highness.

958
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,230
MAN:
Now be it known
throughout the kingdom,

959
01:14:47,236 --> 01:14:50,096
that the Princess Elspeth,

961
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:55,469
by a deed of fortune
and destiny...

(<i> spectators murmuring</i> )

963
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:07,050
No more smoke, I beg you.

964
01:15:07,052 --> 01:15:08,752
Begone!

965
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:13,163
I declare these proceedings...

966
01:15:13,157 --> 01:15:16,117
...duly ordained.

967
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:19,356
TYRIAN:
I knew

968
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,560
I'd find you here.

969
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:26,503
But I'm not as sentimental
as His Majesty.

970
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:28,169
The kingdom...

971
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:30,167
every one of us...

972
01:15:30,169 --> 01:15:33,269
needs this sacrifice.

973
01:15:33,272 --> 01:15:37,512
If you intend to interfere...

974
01:15:37,509 --> 01:15:41,009
you'll have to kill<i> me.</i>

975
01:15:45,983 --> 01:15:47,683
I've plenty of reasons
to kill you

976
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:51,624
that have nothing to do
with this sacrifice.

977
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:55,958
Most impressive.

978
01:15:55,957 --> 01:15:57,417
Can you use it?

979
01:15:57,425 --> 01:15:59,155
ELSPETH:
No!

980
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,260
Stop!

981
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:01,661
Tyrian is right!

982
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:04,002
This is our only hope.

Run!

990
01:16:50,769 --> 01:16:52,839
Run!

991

Where are you going?!

992
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:15,551
You failed, my friend.

993
01:17:15,556 --> 01:17:19,956
And I thank
the gods for it.

994
01:17:30,736 --> 01:17:32,596

from the beginning!

1087
01:30:16,665 --> 01:30:19,225
He knew this
was going to happen!

Where are you going?

We can slay this dragon
with song and prayer.

If we can but join
together in faith,

1095
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:42,245
we shall live,

1096
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:46,220
and the beast
shall die.

I won't let you
kill yourself!

1100
01:30:51,556 --> 01:30:52,886
He couldn't walk.

1101
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,690
He knew he couldn't
make the journey,

1102
01:30:54,691 --> 01:30:57,161
so he had us
make it for him.

1103
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,890
Don't you see?

1104
01:31:03,299 --> 01:31:05,429
All right, I'm
coming, too.

1105
01:31:05,434 --> 01:31:06,334
No, you're not.

1106
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:07,404
This is for me to do.

1107
01:31:07,401 --> 01:31:08,671
I'm not afraid.

1108
01:31:08,668 --> 01:31:12,198
After all,
I was a man.

1109
01:31:12,204 --> 01:31:15,044
Remember?

1110
01:31:17,308 --> 01:31:21,878
(<i> reciting spell in Latin</i> )

1111
01:31:21,878 --> 01:31:24,608
Stay close.

1112
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:26,654
What's that?

1113
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,148
Nothing. Come on.

1114
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,179
I want to see.

1115
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:31,153
No, you don't.

1116
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:36,848
All right.
Wait here.

1117
01:31:45,762 --> 01:31:48,432
Galen?

1118
01:31:51,967 --> 01:31:54,667
Galen!

1119
01:31:58,939 --> 01:32:01,769
Where are you?

1120
01:32:07,046 --> 01:32:10,506
(<i> fire roaring</i> )

(<i> chanting spell in Latin</i> )

1123
01:33:59,254 --> 01:34:01,554
You're back.

1124
01:34:01,556 --> 01:34:04,486
I thank the powers
that made me.

1125
01:34:04,492 --> 01:34:06,732
Glad to see you, too.

1126
01:34:06,727 --> 01:34:09,657
You didn't bring
along anything to eat,

1127
01:34:09,663 --> 01:34:11,263
by any chance?

1128
01:34:11,264 --> 01:34:12,964
Food?

1129
01:34:12,965 --> 01:34:14,325
But come along.

1130
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:16,233
There's much to do.

1131
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,204
No, please.

1132
01:34:18,202 --> 01:34:20,642
I thought
I was a sorcerer.

1133
01:34:20,637 --> 01:34:22,137
I'm not.

1134
01:34:22,138 --> 01:34:24,068
I thought I had power.

1135
01:34:24,073 --> 01:34:24,843
I don't.

1136
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,340
You said to be strong.

1137
01:34:27,342 --> 01:34:29,032
I wasn't.

1138
01:34:29,026 --> 01:34:30,706
But you were,
my boy, you were,

1139
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:34,652
and you'll be
stronger yet.

1140
01:34:34,649 --> 01:34:37,849
Thou art baptized in
the name of the Father,

1141
01:34:37,852 --> 01:34:39,592
the Son, the Holy Ghost,

1142
01:34:39,587 --> 01:34:43,047
and may the Lord
lead us from darkness

1143
01:34:43,056 --> 01:34:45,086
and-and demons.

1144
01:34:45,091 --> 01:34:46,991
Look!

(<i> growling</i> )

1151
01:35:57,687 --> 01:36:00,287
Galen!

1152
01:36:05,727 --> 01:36:08,687
This is Valerian.

1153
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:11,296
I know, I remember.

1154
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:14,328
The girl who came to us

1155
01:36:14,334 --> 01:36:16,944
as a boy.

1156
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:20,797
There's something you must do.

1157
01:36:20,806 --> 01:36:22,066
Anything.

1158
01:36:22,073 --> 01:36:27,843
I want you to
destroy the amulet...

1159
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:33,920
and me along with it.

1160
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:42,691
<i> You brought me from the flame.</i>

1161
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:44,990
You must send me back.

1162
01:36:44,992 --> 01:36:48,492
You'll know the time.

1163
01:36:48,494 --> 01:36:50,134
You must act

1164
01:36:50,128 --> 01:36:55,228
while life is still in me.

1165
01:36:59,437 --> 01:37:03,367

1174
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,020
There!

(<i> snarling</i> )

1178
01:39:45,589 --> 01:39:48,759
Here, Galen,
do what he said.

1179
01:39:48,758 --> 01:39:50,918
Destroy the amulet.

1180
01:39:50,926 --> 01:39:52,786
Smash it.

1181
01:39:52,794 --> 01:39:54,064
No!

1182
01:39:54,061 --> 01:39:56,091
He said I'd know the time.

(<i> chanting spell in Latin</i> )

1187
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:54,947
He told you to do it.

1188
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:56,779
Not yet!

1189
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:22,140

GREIL:
Let us pray.

1198
01:43:48,376 --> 01:43:52,876
We thank thee, Lord,
for this divine deliverance.

1199
01:43:52,879 --> 01:43:55,609
Verily is thy presence
amongst us

1200

fully manifest
(<i> hoofbeats approaching</i> )

1201
01:43:58,217 --> 01:44:00,477
in this, thy great work.

1202
01:44:20,537 --> 01:44:23,237
Arise, children of the Lord.

1203
01:44:23,239 --> 01:44:27,409
Forsake forevermore
the pagan mysteries,

1204
01:44:27,409 --> 01:44:29,939
the high superstitions
of the past.

1205
01:44:29,944 --> 01:44:32,144
Rejoice in the true power
of the Christian...

You'll miss Ulrich.

GALEN:
Yes.

1209
01:44:53,098 --> 01:44:54,998
VALERIAN:
And the amulet.

1210
01:44:54,999 --> 01:44:57,099
GALEN:
That, too.

1211
01:44:57,101 --> 01:44:58,171
I don't.

1212
01:44:58,168 --> 01:44:59,498
I'm glad it's gone.

1213
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:03,242
You may not be a sorcerer,
Galen Brandwardyn,

1214
01:45:03,238 --> 01:45:05,568
but that
doesn't matter.

1215
01:45:05,573 --> 01:45:06,813
Not to me.

1216
01:45:06,807 --> 01:45:07,937
I know.

1217
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:10,711
I just wish...

1218
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:11,910
What?

1219
01:45:11,911 --> 01:45:14,481
We had a horse.
