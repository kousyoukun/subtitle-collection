00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:34,146
**

3
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:36,650
When I made love to him

4
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:40,654
I dwell in the mystery
of our oneness.

5
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:43,949
It was a feeling so spiritual

6
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,888
It was as though I
should remove my shoes

7
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,230
in the presence of the holy.

8
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:51,820
With my lips.

9
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:55,835
I traced my name upon his skin,

10
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,074
and I'd find God there.

11
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:02,174
With my heart pressed
against his chest

12
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:05,135
his breath breathing
life into my soul,

13
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,434
I could live again.

14
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:09,981
I'd see my lover there.

15
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:13,841
And no longer was it,
that I want him, need him

16
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,538
or loved him, but that...

17
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:18,395
..I was him.

18
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,780
This was Chris, my
mission companion.

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,742
Five years ago, we
were separated,

20
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:32,244
after it was discovered,
that we were slightly more

21
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,245
than just mission companions.

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,498
I was immediately sent home,

23
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,254
and Chris was allowed to
stay in Clackamas Falls.

24
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:42,295
But we kept in touch.

25
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,306
And after his mission,

26
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:46,415
We went on a trip
across America.

27
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:49,423
We had time of our lives.

28
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:52,729
For a few months, we weren't
Elder Smith and Elder Merrill.

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,102
We had no obligations

30
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:56,742
and no pressure from our
families or the church.

31
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,649
We were just Chris and RJ.

32
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:02,643
On our own and loving
every minute of it.

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,609
After some time, we faced
the reality, that we would

34
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,611
eventually, have to go home.

35
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,947
I drove into Salt Lake,
Chris' home town.

36
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:15,421
We agreed to take care of
our respective loose ends.

37
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,335
And he talked about transferring
to Poisy State with me.

38
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,998
We kissed and said goodbye.

39
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,069
And I went home to Idaho Falls.

40
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,296
I never saw him again.

41
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,401
I sent letters, I'd call...

42
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,362
And nothing.

43
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,262
If only I knew, what
happened to him,

44
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,099
then maybe, I'd
have some closure.

45
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,837
These days I live in Seattle.

46
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,787
I'm neither Mormon, nor gentile.

47
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,830
I was never formally
excommunicated.

48
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:53,861
I just stopped associating
myself with the church at all.

49
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:57,988
But... I still wear
my temple garments

50
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:00,723
I still have a food storage.

51
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:03,285
And I still have a deep love...

52
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,397
for our Heavenly Father.

53
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,443
So, from what you've
been telling me...

54
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:16,654
you've been working
hard to stay focussed

55
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,756
and maintain the
standing of the Church.

56
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:20,345
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:25,168
Six months ago, I was intimate
with my mission companion,

58
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,645
even though I knew it was wrong.

59
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:34,693
Do you still think that you are
unfazed of same-sex attraction?

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,976
I am much stronger now.

61
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,623
Would you like to continue
your service to your Church ?

62
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:51,646
Yes, I would.

63
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,396
More than anything.

64
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,052
As I said before,

65
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,912
our Heavenly Father doesn't
present to us any temptation...

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,297
that we do not have the
power to overcome.

67
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:08,379
It's a choice, that we make

68
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,560
To act in virtue, or
give in to temptation.

69
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:19,442
Considering your humility and
desire to do the right thing,

70
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,707
I see no need for
disciplinary action.

71
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,520
Thank you.

72
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:30,449
Thank you.

73
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:25,490
It is an honor to witness
two young people...

74
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:28,076
So deeply in love,
and so dedicated

75
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,544
to the church and
our Heavenly Father.

76
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,462
Marriage is for eternity

77
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,594
It is the love,that
will last in this life...

78
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,611
.. and the next.

79
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:53,783
Your dedication...

80
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:57,431
to the Church and to this
family, has brought you here.

81
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,207
You've been given
a second chance.

82
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:09,978
I know...

83
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,504
that you have the courage...

84
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,969
and the strentgh, to stay on
the right track, this time.

85
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,555
I love you, son.

86
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,393
I love you too.

87
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,634
Now, what do you say, we
get back in there and

88
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,370
join what's left of the party.

89
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,759
I'm so sorry, Dad.

90
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,267
I'm so sorry, for everything.

91
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,723
Now, Chris...

92
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:43,201
You've done the right thing.

93
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,329
- Alright?
- Yes

94
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,982
I am so proud of you.

95
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:00,720
- Are you okay?
- Yes sir, I'm fine.

96
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:04,318
I'm gonna go join the party.
You take a minute.

97
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,465
- Come when you're ready.
- Yes sir.

98
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,413
Okay, I'm gonna be late.

99
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,027
You know I have somewhere
else to be too.

100
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:26,532
I know.

101
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,975
I have a meeting...
in like 30 minutes.

102
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,185
And ?

103
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,668
- I got to go.
- No..

104
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,164
You know I wrestled
in Highschool...

105
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:52,790
and College.

106
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:58,702
Okay. Okay.

107
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,057
- Now, you shouldn't eat that stuff.
- And why not?

108
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:33,096
- It's loaded with sugar?
- I like sugar.

109
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:45,786
Thank you.

110
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:06,451
- Want some?
- No

111
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:12,193
You know? I'm nervous
about tonight.

112
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:13,548
Don't be.

113
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:15,183
Are you sure you ready for this?

114
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:16,650
No.

115
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:22,573
- You think it's time, they met us?
- Yup.

116
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,277
I gotta go.

117
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:27,606
I'm gonna be late.

118
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,918
Bye !

119
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,202
Sorry.

120
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:06,312
Sorry.

121
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,705
Hey, Rodney!

122
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:20,210
- RJ? I'm his mother.
- Oh... Well, how are you?

123
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,420
Unfortunately, very badly.

124
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:26,036
I'm sorry to hear that...
Is everything okay?

125
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,910
Sorry RJ, But Rodney died.

126
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:42,726
- You want some chicken?
- Is really good!

127
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,474
Amazingly good. You
gonna love it.

128
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,446
Who is calling me?

129
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:52,657
- I do not know.
- Sorry.

130
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,670
- You want one of Mummy's?
- No, no?

131
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,493
Hello?

132
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,341
Speaking.

133
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:09,590
Yes, Mam! How are you?

134
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,887
Oh no!

135
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,800
Did I ever tell you
about Rodney?

136
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:23,644
A little...

137
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,824
I met him on my mission, with
my mission companion Chris,

138
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:33,185
He was a veteran of Iraq.

139
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,521
He had PTST, so

140
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,002
We tried so hard to
convert him, but...

141
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,896
We'd always end up hanging
out and smoking pot..

142
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,093
He was always so accepting
of Chris and I.

143
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,929
Yes.

144
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,766
You did talk about him.

145
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:21,973
- Are you going to the funeral?
- I think so.

146
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,280
Okay.

147
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,418
Sorry, I'm late. How long
are you waiting for?

148
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,277
About twenty minutes.

149
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,919
- Hello, sorry.
- It was nothing.

150
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:42,381
Mom, Dad, this is Paul.

151
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,097
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Paul.

152
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,140
- Hi - Hi.

153
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:51,018
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you too.

154
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,689
- So, how was your flight?
- Bumpy.

155
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:58,525
- Do I want to ask?
- Yes, we will ask.

156
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,424
What do you want to drink?

157
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:05,446
- I mineral water..
- I Coca Cola.

158
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,032
- Well, I drink.
- Thank you.

159
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:12,037
- So Coca-Cola?
- Yes

160
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:20,643
So... Mr. and Mrs. Smith,
How long are you in town?

161
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:23,858
- Just till Sunday evening...
- We're just here for the weekend

162
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:26,800
- We don't want to be in the way.
- Dad you're not in the way.

163
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:30,179
- I do not know, we never hear from you.
- Tom... - No!

164
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,932
I'm not trying to start anything,
I'm just saying,

165
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:36,184
I wish to hear from my son more.
I misshim.

166
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,287
Mary Ann calls at
least once a week.

167
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:42,170
- Okay, I'll check in more
- That would be nice.

168
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,181
So Paul, what do you do?

169
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:49,971
- I am a personal trainer.
- Oh that's nice.

170
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:53,576
- Paul is working on his MBA.
- Oh really?

171
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:56,120
Tell RJ that has to
completing his masters.

172
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,164
- I'll tell you the same.
- Okay, okay.

173
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,818
Maybe at some point...
but... Not now.

174
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,504
- And how's work?
- It goes well, yes.

175
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:09,209
I'm not independent, I
am in the office too...

176
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,133
But additionally
nothing interesting.

177
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:13,728
I do not know. Nothing
too exciting.

178
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,844
How is the shop, Dad?

179
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,383
Well. All is well. I
can not complain.

180
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,980
Do you know Mr. Smith,
my father is a mechanic.

181
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:26,299
Really?

182
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,700
Yes, he works primarily
on Swedish automobiles.

183
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:33,025
- Well... they know how to make cars...
- Yes.

184
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,608
- Gloria? - Yes -. I'm RJ.

185
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,981
How nice to finally meet you.

186
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:04,116
- I'm so glad you came.
- No, I would not miss it for anything.

187
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:09,470
You know, not many people knew
and I did not go there often.

188
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,937
Nice to meet two of
his good friends.

189
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,628
- I also loved meeting her.
- Thank you.

190
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,694
Rodney was a complex man.

191
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,364
And through the hardships
that life threw at him,

192
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,568
he had this amazing
ability to make us laugh.

193
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:59,416
Some of you may not know
this about Rodney, but

194
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,458
he was a religious man.

195
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,713
Though he may not have
considered himself, to be so.

196
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:09,051
Though he alluded the
Doctrines of Faith,

197
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:11,989
he embodied their essence.

198
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,255
And as a lifelong seeker,
he had an amazing ability

199
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,175
to help people find their way.

200
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,392
There is a heaven.

201
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,032
And Rodney is there.

202
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,779
- Amen - Amen.

203
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,598
I'm sorry for your loss.

204
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:50,572
Thank you.

205
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,178
Thank you.

206
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:05,818
RJ!

207
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,899
I almost forgot
to give you this.

208
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,018
- He was going to mail it to you.
- Thank you.

209
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,625
- You keep in touch now.
- I will.

210
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,496
I'm sorry your loss.
I will miss him.

211
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,525
I am too.

212
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,705
- Take care now, you.
- I will.

213
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,398
And don't open that here.

214
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:34,964
- Chris!
- Chris.

215
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:37,383
Yes?

216
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:41,471
How are you?

217
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:46,418
Yeah, ehm...

218
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,519
Can we go somewhere and talk?

219
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:54,434
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Maybe we can catch up.

220
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:31,266
- Hi - Hi.

221
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:37,971
What a day.

222
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,035
Yes.

223
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:46,938
Did you get to speak to him?

224
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:49,559
- To Rodney?
- Yeah...

225
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:53,037
No... not really.

226
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,072
I spoke to him a few times
after the end of the mission.

227
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:00,168
But we lost contact.

228
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:07,175
- You talked to him?
- A few months ago. Yes.

229
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:10,304
- Sometimes I visited.
- Great.

230
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:14,432
I can't believe he's gone.

231
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,273
Wish I had a chance
to say goodbye.

232
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,930
He had nothing but
fond memories of you.

233
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,444
It's good to hear.

234
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:30,886
It's surreal, is not it?

235
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,950
Yes.

236
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,808
Sitting here with you
is very surreal.

237
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:44,628
- How long has it been?
- Five years. - Five years.

238
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:49,422
- You did this?
- I did it, but...

239
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:52,976
I said a month or
two or so and...

240
00:21:53,052 --> 00:21:54,821
- Ok -. Yes.

241
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,223
Well, how's life?

242
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,949
I'm happily married,
I live in Salt Lake

243
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,626
I have a little
daughter, three years

244
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,057
I can not believe that.

245
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,756
I work in pharmaceutical sales, so...

246
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,272
life's pretty good.

247
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:19,231
- Are you married?
- Yes

248
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,718
She's amazing, she's
like an angel.

249
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:25,042
I don't have a picture to show, but...

250
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,376
she's incredible.

251
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,235
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

252
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:37,663
What about you?

253
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,515
I'm the Earth and Culture
editor at a Seattle magazine.

254
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,501
Yes, and I've ehm...

255
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:49,104
I've written a couple of
short non-fiction books.

256
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:52,187
- Really? - Yes.
 - Can I find them anywhere?

257
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,184
Yeah, they're in
some bookstores.

258
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:58,246
I haven't really inquired after
all means of distribution,

259
00:22:58,272 --> 00:22:59,566
but yeah, they're there.
- Oh.

260
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:03,067
- I'll look for them.
- Cool.

261
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,126
Are you seeing anybody? Or...

262
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,811
- I've been seeing someone for a while.
- Ok.

263
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,554
- We are doing well.
- What is her name?

264
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:23,616
Paul.

265
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:34,604
It's reaslly good
to see you, Chris.

266
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,531
It's good to see you too.

267
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:42,983
I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

268
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,290
Yes, me too, but...

269
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,886
our Heavenly Father had a plan.

270
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:57,159
Listen, I hate to make this
brief, but I have a really early

271
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,000
flight tomorrow morning, and
it has been a very long day.

272
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,506
It looks like they're
closing up here anyhow,

273
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,853
so I'm going to bed.

274
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,486
- But it was nice.
- Yes, it was good.

275
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:11,027
Can I walk you up?

276
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:13,632
You wanna walk me to my room?

277
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:14,616
Yes.

278
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:19,104
- Yes, of course.
- Okay. Yeah.

279
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:21,280
That'll be fine.

280
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:26,737
Thanks,

281
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,702
Well, this is me.

282
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,340
Chris.

283
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:51,719
Are you sure there's nothing
else you wanna talk about?

284
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:55,204
What exactly would
you like to talk about?

285
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:02,891
You can't just pretend,
that nothing happened.

286
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:07,733
R.J.

287
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,543
Its good to see you, and I'm
glad you're doing well...

288
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,747
but I came here to pay
my respects Rodney...

289
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:15,770
So did I.

290
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:19,120
Then I need you to respect that.

291
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:23,696
Okay.

292
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:29,462
Good night.

Thank you.

Good.

305

You look tired?

Yes, a little, I am.

- Oh, maybe.
- Thank you.

309
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:09,839
It looks amazing.

310
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:12,278
I wanted something
ready when you got here.

311
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:14,622
- It's great.
- Want some?

312
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,864
You look so good in your suit.

313
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:42,824
Thank you.

314
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,036
Hey guess what?

315
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:48,629
What?

316
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,832
I'm fiinally gonna
get my red jacket.

317
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:52,246
- Really?
- Yeah.

318
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:54,819
- Congratulations baby!
- Thank you.

319
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:03,468
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

320
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,313
- Feels good.
- Yeah?

321
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:17,610
I'm so sorry.

322
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:19,581
What's wrong?

323
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,774
It's been a rough couple
of days, you know.

324
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:26,864
Yeah.

325
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:29,231
It's okay.

326
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,697
It's okay.

327
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,662
I'm so sorry.

328
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:36,973
It's okay.

329
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,915
- I think I'm too tired.
- Yes I know.

330
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:55,326
I love you.

331
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,834
- Hey.
- How are you?

332
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:27,365
- Okay, and you?
- Good, how's work?

333
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:30,865
- It's good, how was your day?
- Fantastic...

334
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,040
- So much work.
- Good, good.

335
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:36,318
Do you want anything?

336
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:40,514
I tell you in just a minute...
This is such a nice surprise.

337
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:51,529
Hey, what's up?

338
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:59,060
You know I've always
been honest with you.

339
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:01,456
Yes.

340
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,963
I don't think we should
see each other for a while.

341
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:28,022
Why?

342
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:33,420
Cause I don't think I can give
you what you need, right now.

343
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,313
God, what is this?

344
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:56,882
I mean, we have met your family.

345
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,313
We did meet your parents.

346
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:05,149
I know...

347
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,935
I know, it's taken me a
long time to get here,

348
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:11,530
but I am here, with
everthing that I am.

349
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,222
You are everything
that I ever wanted.

350
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,689
It's always been you...

351
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,292
who's been holding us back.

352
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,466
- You know that?
- I know that.

353
00:36:46,596 --> 00:36:48,556
I know what this is about.

354
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:55,151
I know!

355
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,276
You go...

356
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:05,487
..you go do...

357
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,575
whatever it is, that
you have to do.

358
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:13,776
But I want you to know...

359
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:14,687
that I ...

360
00:37:15,395 --> 00:37:16,637
I may not still be here, just

361
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:18,594
waiting for you,
when you get back.

362
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:29,762
Please stay.

363
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:15,185
He handles all the marketing.

364
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,550
Can you hold on a second?

365
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:21,519
Hey, I was wondering, do you think
you need me around next week?

366
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:24,061
You haven't really
been here much, Rick.

367
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:27,024
Right, but I was thinking about
taking a writing vacatioin,

368
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:30,235
I'm working on a story.
I think you gonna love it

369
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:34,176
- Okay, that'll work, yeah.
- Great,l thank you.

370
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,255
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah.

371
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:37,973
Okay, fine.

372
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:41,309
- Where are you gonna go?
- Ehm...

373
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,817
♪ Here I make my solemn vow ♪

374
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:53,513
♪ To Keep His light in front of me ♪

375
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:59,473

376
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:05,220
♪ Of what harm comes unto me ♪

377
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:24,362
...and the love in our heart.

378
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,594
We say these things in the
name of Jesus Christ.

379
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,079
- Amen - Amen.

380
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:31,338
- Dig in.
- yammm...

381
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,323
Peaches, you like sucking?

382
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:36,151
Are you dipping?

383
00:39:36,372 --> 00:39:38,432
Dipping in the water?
You like that?

384
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:42,224
- This is realy good. - Yes?
- Should cook every night.

385
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:42,964
Thank you.

386
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:00,651
What's the noise?

387
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:05,114
- Are you expecting anybody?
- No, you? - No

388
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:12,955
What was that noise?

389
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,418
Hi.

390
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,947
- Is this a bad time?
- Yes.

391
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,679
What are you doing here?

392
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:33,029
Why would you come to my house?
How do you know where I live?

393
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,612
Explain yourself!

394
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,609
- I got your address from Gloria.
- Gloria.

395
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,303
Are you crazy?

396
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,024
- Hi - Hi.

397
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:58,585
- Hi - Hi.

398
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:00,803
Are you gonna introduce
me to your friend?

399
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:05,499
- Yes. Honey, this is my friend RJ.
- RJ, this is my wife, Emily.

400
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:08,161
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

401
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,452
Thanks for stopping by.

402
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:15,538
It was good to see you.

403
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:16,597
Oh...

404
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:21,948
Actually, we're having dinner. You're
welcome to join us, if you'd like.

405
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:24,596
Sure, yeah.

406
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:28,996
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

407
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:32,053
- OK, come on in.
- Thank you.

408
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,060
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

409
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:47,739
So, ehm, RJ, how do you and
Chris know each other?

410
00:41:49,295 --> 00:41:51,264
Well... that's a good question...

411
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:53,820
Chris, would you
like to, maybe...

412
00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,220
Yeah, ehm...

413
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:02,442
RJ and I met, when I was on
my mission in Clackamas Falls.

414
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,630
- Really? - Mmm...
- Well, it's wonderful.

415
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:10,398
- RJ was my mission companion.
- Wow.

416
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,692
And, do you live here
in Salt Lake City?

417
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:17,552
- No, actually, I live in Seattle.
- Seattle?

418
00:42:17,584 --> 00:42:20,304
- So, what brings you here?
- I'm here for work.

419
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:23,038
- What kind of work?
- I am a writer.

420
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,988
A writer? Wow!

421
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:27,710
- Like for a magazine or...
- Yeah, actually...

422
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:30,947
- Magazine... Which magazine?
- The Seattle Magazine.

423
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:34,606
And they're doing a piece
on Salt Lake City?

424
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:37,172
No, no actually...

425
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:40,827
the story I'm working on, has a little
bit to do with the Salt Lake, so...

426
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:44,429
I thought I'd come down
here for some inspiration.

427
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:48,700
- Great. - Mmm...
- How long are you in town?

428
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:53,754
I don't know. I guess until
the story is finished.

429
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:57,885
Where are you staying?

430
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,473
Well, ehm...

431
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:04,950
Okay, honey.

432
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:17,303
I think it's her bedtime.

433
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,423
I'm sorry, is it me?
I'm so sorry, if it was me.

434
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,502
Okay.

435
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:28,199
Come.

436
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,507
Let's go.

437
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:51,450
- Hi - Hi.

438
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,515
Why are you here? Why...

439
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:02,083
You came to my house?

440
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:06,597
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- Ok

441
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,384
Let's talk.

442
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:15,071
- Maybe not now...
- Yes, maybe not right now.

443
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:21,891
- I'm so sorry.
- Ok - She is really tired.

444
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:23,202
- It's a little late.
- Yeah.

445
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,690
Anyway, what I...

446
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,795
I don't have any
place to stay yet,

447
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:30,717
I think I might just go
to a motel nearby, maybe?

448
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:32,549
Oh, you don't need to do that.

449
00:44:32,575 --> 00:44:36,095
We have so much space.
You can stay with us, if you'd like.

450
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,442
- If you want.
- Sure!

451
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:42,723
Yeah, is that okay
with you, Chris?

452
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,209
Yeah, of course.

453
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,418
You're more than welcome to stay,
for the night, if you'd like.

454
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,020
Great.

455
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:52,247
You guys probably have a
lot of catching up to do ?

456
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,725
- Yeah!
- We do. We do.

457
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,025
This is you, at the
end of the stairs.

458
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:00,713
The bag looks heavy,
I should help.

459
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:01,558
No, it's okay.

460
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:02,808
Alright.

461
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,144
Here you go.

462
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:08,648
- Thank you.
- Yes of course.

463
00:45:09,194 --> 00:45:13,459
Well, you're probably super tired.
So you know...

464
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,495
If you need anything
just let me know, okay?

465
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:16,783
I will. Thank you so much.

466
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,980
- Yeah, it's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

467
00:45:21,028 --> 00:45:23,805
- Well, have a good night.
- You too.

468
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:24,957
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

469
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:10,331
Meet me at Mercury Grove on North
Canyon at 7am. Please. Chris.

470
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:22,297
What are you doing?

471
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:27,198
- Ricky, what are you doing?
- I just want to talk.

472
00:46:28,448 --> 00:46:30,108
I do not want to talk
about the mission.

473
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:31,057
Okay.

474
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,268
So let's talk about
something else.

475
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:36,087
- I like your jacket.
- Thanks.

476
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:39,785
RJ.

477
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,259
I'm married.

478
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,862
- And I'm living honorably.
- Okay.

479
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:47,808
I didn't mean to
interfere with you.

480
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,361
It's too late for that.

481
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:53,678
Don't you think it's
a little crazy?

482
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,093
You showing up out of
nowhere, like this?

483
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:59,486
Yes it is, but going to
Clackamas Falls

484
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:03,213
And Rodney dying and
seeing you again.

485
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:04,689
It's just...

486
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,800
it sparked something in me.

487
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:09,987
And all of a sudden,
I'm 20 years old,

488
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:12,387
And you walked into my life.

489
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:17,448
And years of confusion and
shame jusst disappear.

490
00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:20,149
Because I found somebody.

491
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:24,886
That knows me, that
understands me.

492
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:26,255
I can't find that anywhere else.

493
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:27,768
It comes close, but...

494
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:29,738
It's not the same.

495
00:47:31,427 --> 00:47:32,966
And then, suddenly I'm here.

496
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:38,787
Why did you cut me out
of your life, Chris?

497
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:40,830
I had no choice.

498
00:47:41,464 --> 00:47:44,134
All I want, is to be
a part of your life.

499
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:46,751
- That's not possible.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

500
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:49,494
I have a meeting to go to.

501
00:47:51,922 --> 00:47:53,338
You still go to church RJ?

502
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:55,557
No, regretfully I don't.

503
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:57,681
Well, you should.

504
00:47:58,711 --> 00:48:00,712
What are you doing, Chris?
What do you mean?

505
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:02,839
We spent a year of
our lives together.

506
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:04,529
We made love.

507
00:48:04,877 --> 00:48:07,404
We fell in love.
You're not straight!

508
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,433
- I feel sorry for you.
- Why?

509
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:12,153
Because you are
living a life of sin.

510
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,155
And you are obsessing

511
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:16,414
over something that never
should have happened !

512
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,878
It was a phase !

513
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:23,347
The Lord has declared
that no unclean thing

514
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:25,188
shall inherit the
Kingdom of Heavens.

515
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:28,341
Our sin makes us unclean.

516
00:48:28,855 --> 00:48:31,858
Unworthy to be in the presence
of our Heavenly Father.

517
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:33,875
Verily, verily, I
say onto you...

518
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:36,039
woe be unto him that
lieth to deceive

519
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,661
because he supposeth that
another lieth to deceive

520
00:48:38,904 --> 00:48:42,705
for such are not exempt
from the justice of God.

521
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:44,497
You are living a lie.

522
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:46,666
And you brought your
entire family into it.

523
00:48:46,712 --> 00:48:48,884
How dare you bring
my family into this?

524
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:50,633
Chris, I don't want to fight,

525
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:52,764
I didn't come all this way,
to end things like this.

526
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,207
- But I'm worried about you.
- You're worried about me?

527
00:48:55,915 --> 00:49:00,760
This coming from a guy, who
traveled 800 miles, uninvited!

528
00:49:04,118 --> 00:49:05,744
I'm more worried about you.

529
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,274
Good, it shows that you care.

530
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:11,198
I've always cared about you.

531
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:13,237
Did you ever care about me?

532
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,696
- Chris, Chris!
- What?

533
00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:22,363
I'm gonna be here
for a few days.

534
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,921
If you want to talk,
just get a hold of me

535
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:23,733
- Hello?
- Hi

536
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,137
- Hey.
- Hey.

537
00:51:42,553 --> 00:51:44,132
What are you doing?

538
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:46,710
You can't eat rice with chopsticks.
I don't know how they..

539
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:48,693
Just eat it with a fork.

540
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,553
- I didn't see that.
- Thank you.

541
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,026
Here we go.

542
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,955
It's easier with broccoli and
beef, I'm just saying...

543
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:04,620
It's okay, your trial with rice.

544
00:52:10,654 --> 00:52:13,949
- I read through one of your books.
- Oh really? - Yes.

545
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:16,631
Whichj one?

546
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:22,461
I don't even know. I'm sorry.
It's embarassing

547
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:23,595
No, it's okay.

548
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:28,517
It was very eloquently
written, what I did read.

549
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:30,927
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

550
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,627
Do you remember...

551
00:52:41,362 --> 00:52:42,908
when we first met Rodney?

552
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:44,065
Yeah.

553
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:48,953
He was just smoking pot...

554
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:51,789
in front of a couple of missionaries.

555
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:53,666
- And no shame.
- Like you do.

556
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,131
Like you do.

557
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:57,897
And that apartment...

558
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,584
It just smelled of beer, and mildew and...

559
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:04,502
And urine.
yeah, little bit of urine.

560
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:06,996
I think I saw a live
possum in his kitchen.

561
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:08,168
I saw a dead one.

562
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:10,389
I think it was the same one.

563
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:13,903
He was really good.

564
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,521
- Yes,he was a character.
- Definitely.

565
00:53:17,855 --> 00:53:21,943
- Those were good times
- Yeah, they were.

566
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:24,579
So,,,

567
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:29,323
the last time I saw you...

568
00:53:30,534 --> 00:53:33,745
you were the epitomy
of a collegiate wrestler.

569
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:38,229
- Not so much anymore
- But you look the same though.

570
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:39,011
Thank you.

571
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:41,483
I mean, I lead a simple life.

572
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,514
You know, I go to work...
I come home and...

573
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,343
Paul was there all the time.

574
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:49,815
We were home buddies.

575
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:51,936
You were ?

576
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:55,780
Yeah.

577
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,163
I'm sorry.

578
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:05,029
And I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

579
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,104
- Were both angry...
- I was very angry.

580
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:12,239
It's fine. Fifty-fifty.

581
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:16,096
So, what about you?

582
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:19,621
How's life as a
pharmaceutical rep?

583
00:54:19,663 --> 00:54:20,747
I hate it.

584
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:25,752
It's an atrocious job,
that pays very well.

585
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:28,337
So, why don't you
do something else?

586
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:31,733
When I figure out,what
I want to do, I'll...

587
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:34,886
stop being a pharmaceutical rep.

588
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,729
It seems some time, to
figure out, what that is.

589
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:40,975
Yes.

590
00:54:41,017 --> 00:54:42,245
You will ...

591
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:45,018
You'll figure it out.

592
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:46,605
Yes.

593
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:53,448
You know, it's funny when...

594
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,175
you're younger...

595
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:58,199
you just assume that
life is gonna...

596
00:54:58,479 --> 00:55:01,577
line up, and make
sense, at some point.

597
00:55:02,786 --> 00:55:05,039
You have this vision...

598
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,304
of what you want
your life to be.

599
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:10,968
Mission, family, job, ehm...

600
00:55:14,706 --> 00:55:16,401
You create this idea

601
00:55:16,682 --> 00:55:18,715
of what you want your
life to be like.

602
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:22,022
You create these
images in your head.

603
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:26,563
And as you go along,

604
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,892
these images shatter.

605
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,898
As if they were nothing.

606
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:41,447
They're so easily inceived.

607
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:43,768
and so easily broken.

608
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:49,991
And all you have left
to do, is just...

609
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:53,103
to accept life.

610
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:57,495
Just the way it is.

611
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,752
Life is a journey, isn't it RJ?

612
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,313
Uh-huh.

613
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:23,038
I should probably get going.

614
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,575
- Yeah.
- ehm, this was fun.

615
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:30,618
Yes it was.

616
00:56:31,717 --> 00:56:34,643
And ehm, if I don't
see you again...

617
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:36,663
I just want you to know that...

618
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,600
I'm really glad, we did this.

619
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:40,565
Me too.

620
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,021
- You'll be welcome...
- No, no.

621
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:09,043
I guess, this is the
closure I came here for.

622
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,501
It's not what I wanted.

623
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:13,904
But maybe this is all there is.

624
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:33,439
- This is wonderful, Emily.
- It really is. - Thank you.

625
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,548
She's trying to make me fat?

626
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,728
- No.
- Right.

627
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:40,314
Says the guy who gets up at
4:30 every morning to work out.

628
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:45,005
So, how are sales?

629
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:47,197
Good, can't complain.

630
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,118
I think, the toughest
part of my job is,

631
00:57:50,182 --> 00:57:52,206
I travel so much and
I'm away from my girl.

632
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:54,411
You work so hard.

633
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:57,032
But he's got the
next two weeks off.

634
00:57:57,242 --> 00:57:58,929
So, I've got him all to myself.

635
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,124
- About time.
- Yeah.

636
00:58:01,775 --> 00:58:03,769
I don't know how you
do it, with all the...

637
00:58:04,351 --> 00:58:07,058
hotels, airports...

638
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,262
How do you sleep?

639
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:09,898
I get used to them.

640
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:17,312
So, I don't know
about you, but...

641
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:19,281
I could use a little
bit of dessert.

642
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:23,808
Honey, how about you and Emily go to
the store and get some ice cream?

643
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:26,513
Chris and I can chat about
a few matters of the Church.

644
00:58:28,043 --> 00:58:29,253
Sounds like a great idea.

645
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:34,082
- I wouldn't mind ice cream.
- Sure, yes sir.

646
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:39,746
I'll miss you.

647
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:48,606
Ehm, any particular flavor?

648
00:58:50,124 --> 00:58:52,370
- How about vanilla.
- Yeah, vanilla is great.

649
00:58:52,675 --> 00:58:53,717
Okay.

650
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,525
I'm glad we finally have an
opportunity to be alone and chat

651
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:08,850
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

652
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:16,232
You know, I think you're a man that
really seems to have it all figured out.

653
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,122
Thank you.

654
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:24,176
Chris, do you consider
yourself to be openminded?

655
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:30,178
Yes, yes... for the most part.

656
00:59:31,424 --> 00:59:33,991
Cause there's something, I like
to show you, if that's okay.

657
00:59:34,582 --> 00:59:37,335
- Ok . - Great.

658
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,780
Great, now before I begin,

659
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:42,952
I wanna ask you to...

660
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:48,276
try to suspend the way you
normally read Scripture?

661
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:51,431
Try to listen to this with...

662
00:59:51,915 --> 00:59:53,120
a delicate touch:

663
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,076
This is ehm...

664
00:59:57,854 --> 01:00:00,309
not something I can
bring up to anyone.

665
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:03,027
which is why I'd rather discuss
it with someone like you.

666
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:06,111
- No problem.
- Okay

667
01:00:09,323 --> 01:00:12,618
Chris, today I'd like
to talk about Andrew.

668
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:15,454
Now, who was Andrew?

669
01:00:16,197 --> 01:00:18,195
He was an apostle.

670
01:00:19,043 --> 01:00:21,616
- He's the brother of Simon-Peter.
- Right.

671
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,324
Now, we don't know very
much about Andrew.

672
01:00:24,629 --> 01:00:27,027
But tonight, let's allow
Andrew to take our hand...

673
01:00:27,368 --> 01:00:30,413
and lead us to the Gospel
of John, Chapter 13

674
01:00:32,817 --> 01:00:35,846
Jesus Christ says
to his disciples:

675
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:40,052
Most assuredly, I say to you,
one of you will betray me.

676
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:45,546
The disciples looked at one  another,
perplexed about whom he spoke.

677
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:50,289
One of his disciples, the
one, who Jesus loved,

678
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,822
Was lying on his chest.

679
01:00:53,664 --> 01:00:57,132
Simon Peter therefore
motioned to him, to ask Jesus

680
01:00:57,466 --> 01:00:59,390
of whom he was speaking.

681
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:03,312
So, while lying next
to Christ, he asked:

682
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,578
Lord, who is it?

683
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:10,879
So, the Lord, sitting among
the other disciples,

684
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:13,853
while the one he loved,

685
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:17,089
lies on the heart of Christ.

686
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,181
On his chest.

687
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,570
After dinner Jesus disrobes

688
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,649
and pours water into a basin

689
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,566
and begins to wash
the disciples' feet.

690
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:37,128
There's nothing more
gentle and holy...

691
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:39,687
then washing another's feet.

692
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:43,046
Aaron... can I...

693
01:01:43,486 --> 01:01:45,864
interject there for a moment...

694
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:49,690
- I do not know...
- Just hold on, hold on.

695
01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:51,408
- Hear me out.
- Alright.

696
01:01:52,211 --> 01:01:54,796
I spent a lot of time
thinking about this.

697
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:57,478
And I can't see it any other
way, then how it's written.

698
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:01,421
There is a tenderness
in these words.

699
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:05,311
Christ loves these men
dearly, and one above all.

700
01:02:06,073 --> 01:02:08,542
And when he touches them...

701
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:12,522
It is a delicate and
beautiful act of kindness...

702
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:13,982
And love.

703
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:18,110
And while others
may say, that...

704
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,335
by loving his disciples,

705
01:02:20,944 --> 01:02:23,180
Jesus fell in love
with humanity.

706
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:25,663
I can explain to you,
why I believe...

707
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:27,788
That this Scripture
does not refer...

708
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:31,417
to a call, to a love
for human kind.

709
01:02:32,177 --> 01:02:33,423
But instead,

710
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,526
refers more specifically
to his love

711
01:02:36,626 --> 01:02:38,604
- of any...
- You can stop right there.

712
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:41,067
I know what you're
trying to insinuate,

713
01:02:41,093 --> 01:02:42,742
and frankly, I don't like it.

714
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,512
- Chris, I'm just being...
- That's enough!

715
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:52,080
Okay, okay.

716
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:55,631
I didn't mean to make you angry.

717
01:02:56,421 --> 01:02:57,619
I'm sorry.

718
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,233
Chris, I think you and
I, are a lot alike.

719
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:06,242
- I too am struggling.
- I'm not struggling.

720
01:03:10,617 --> 01:03:11,618
Okay.

721
01:03:13,114 --> 01:03:16,791
I went to a small
highschool in Arizona.

722
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,103
This kid transferred
in to sophomore year.

723
01:03:20,618 --> 01:03:24,030
and he wasn't exactly popular.
They called him "the narc".

724
01:03:24,497 --> 01:03:27,141
He was always telltaling,
he was just obnoxious.

725
01:03:28,397 --> 01:03:30,725
He was very devoted
to Christ, however.

726
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:32,648
We bonded, in that sense.

727
01:03:32,823 --> 01:03:34,783
Over time, we became
good friends.

728
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:36,377
Great friends even.

729
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:38,701
And when the other
kids would say to me:

730
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:41,651
Why do you spend time with that guy?
I did not care.

731
01:03:42,366 --> 01:03:45,232
Because in his heart,
he was a good man.

732
01:03:48,612 --> 01:03:51,951
His name was Marshall Harris.

733
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,761
Your zone leader, when
you were on the mission.

734
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:03,546
Chris, I know what happened in
Oregon with your mission companion.

735
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:06,404
And I don't judge you for it.

736
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:12,416
I know your struggle, and...

737
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:14,330
I know it well.

738
01:04:14,878 --> 01:04:16,129
And I want you to know

739
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:18,998
we can help one
another, through this.

740
01:04:19,224 --> 01:04:21,990
Let me help you through this.

741
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:27,084
No temptation has seized you,
except what is common to men.

742
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,803
And we need not be ashamed.

743
01:04:31,797 --> 01:04:32,751
Get out.

744
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:39,442
- I care about you, Chris.
- Get out of my house!

745
01:04:47,712 --> 01:04:49,685
We got bananas and raspberries.

746
01:04:49,974 --> 01:04:50,994
To make splits.

747
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:56,178
Is everything okay?

748
01:04:59,192 --> 01:05:03,624
I suddenly lost my appetite
for ice cream, Emily.

749
01:05:03,723 --> 01:05:04,719
I'm sorry.

750
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:08,719
I'll be seeing you, Chris.

751
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:11,431
Goodbye, Emily.

752
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:20,695
What happened?

753
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:23,661
He ehm...

754
01:05:24,895 --> 01:05:26,263
He wasn't feeling well.

755
01:05:28,068 --> 01:05:29,583
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

756
01:05:52,946 --> 01:05:55,031
That's a ladybug on a leaf.

757
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,155
- Hey sweety.
- Hey.

758
01:05:59,768 --> 01:06:02,497
Hey ehm, what time are you
and RJ getting together?

759
01:06:03,064 --> 01:06:05,780
Around three, I think.

760
01:06:06,306 --> 01:06:09,790
Okay, so I call Kirsten and have
her come just a little earlier.

761
01:06:09,816 --> 01:06:13,110
I won't be around tonight. I have
to help setup for the debut.

762
01:06:13,614 --> 01:06:15,517
What's happening tonight?

763
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,868
It's my red jacket debut.

764
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:23,039
Congratulations again baby.
It's great.

765
01:06:24,028 --> 01:06:26,474
Isn't that a rabbit?
What is that?

766
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,694
Thank you.

767
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:32,799
Um...

768
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:36,099
Did you call the
catering company?

769
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:41,499
Ask them to add 2 more tables, and the
china and the flowers, like Ida ?

770
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,828
No.

771
01:06:44,071 --> 01:06:46,638
No, I completely forgot.
I'm sorry.

772
01:06:48,591 --> 01:06:51,324
- Honey, it's your parents anniversary.
- Yes I know!

773
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,716
I just forgot, and I'm sorry.

774
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,325
I'll get on it.

775
01:06:57,005 --> 01:06:57,942
Yes, okay.

776
01:06:59,390 --> 01:06:59,932
Okay.

777
01:07:00,918 --> 01:07:01,918
Thank you.

778
01:07:27,934 --> 01:07:29,497
I'd like to level with you.

779
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,123
Okay.

780
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:34,302
I'm sorry ...

781
01:07:35,497 --> 01:07:36,772
for abandoning you.

782
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:42,111
I'm sorry for the
way I treated you.

783
01:07:44,383 --> 01:07:45,627
That was cruel.

784
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:52,763
And I'm sorry for not responding to any
of your letters, or phone calls.

785
01:07:58,611 --> 01:07:59,861
I received them all.

786
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:01,723
Your letters.

787
01:08:02,807 --> 01:08:04,849
And they touched me, deeply.

788
01:08:06,111 --> 01:08:07,781
But I couldn't respond.

789
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,888
I truly loved...

790
01:08:16,307 --> 01:08:18,144
the time, that we spent together.

791
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,912
But once I returned home,

792
01:08:27,465 --> 01:08:29,729
I felt my father's shadow.

793
01:08:30,427 --> 01:08:32,887
And his position and
the high authority,

794
01:08:32,913 --> 01:08:34,441
looming over me.

795
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:37,663
Like a cloud.

796
01:08:40,475 --> 01:08:43,017
He recommended that I go
to reparative therapy.

797
01:08:46,347 --> 01:08:47,015
Which I did.

798
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:55,446
And eventually... I was deemed
worthy enough to continue...

799
01:08:55,846 --> 01:08:57,577
my service to the church.

800
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,077
And then I met Emily.

801
01:09:07,218 --> 01:09:12,647
And we had this amazing,
intense connection.

802
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:18,809
And I thought:
"Finally, a cure."

803
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:24,691
I sincerely believed...

804
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,946
that, if I got married, that I
would be given the strength...

805
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:30,812
to overcome this.

806
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:37,570
But every time I see a man
that I'm attracted to,

807
01:09:38,433 --> 01:09:41,706
it's like something inside
of me is screaming,

808
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:43,671
to get out!

809
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:50,366
There is this message,
that is sent and received.

810
01:09:51,224 --> 01:09:52,243
Instantly.

811
01:10:00,986 --> 01:10:03,295
I am a religious man, RJ.

812
01:10:03,907 --> 01:10:05,142
I know you are.

813
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:10,908
But I feel forsaken.

814
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:19,704
I have so much
pain, in my heart.

815
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,982
And I just deal with it.

816
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:29,946
It feels as if there's...

817
01:10:30,228 --> 01:10:30,728
this...

818
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:34,665
axe, that is thrust
into my chest...

819
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:40,663
This pain.

820
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:43,095
The fasting, the prayers...

821
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:46,181
It consumes my life.

822
01:10:47,878 --> 01:10:49,169
And there is...

823
01:10:49,922 --> 01:10:53,050
little energy left,
for anything else.

824
01:11:01,433 --> 01:11:04,727
I am not living honorably.

825
01:11:08,518 --> 01:11:09,635
Chris, I feel so...

826
01:11:10,381 --> 01:11:11,940
I care so much...

827
01:11:12,983 --> 01:11:13,850
about you.

828
01:11:16,516 --> 01:11:17,611
Look at me.

829
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:21,295
There is nothing wrong with us.

830
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,159
We're just victims...

831
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:26,917
Of a culture that
doesn't accept us.

832
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:52,541
May I touch you?

833
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,080
That face...

834
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,659
I've seen you in my dreams.

835
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,174
What? I'm sorry.

836
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,092
I'm sorry.

837
01:12:36,563 --> 01:12:38,510
I thought that's
what you wanted.

838
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:41,779
It is.

839
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:54,155
What do you want me to do?

840
01:12:56,921 --> 01:12:57,713
You see...

841
01:12:59,349 --> 01:13:00,934
I missed you.

842
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:05,955
I missed you too.

843
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,619
I wanted this for so long.

844
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:31,818
This I pledge, as a
"Star Recruiter".

845
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:33,975
This I pledge, as a
"Star Recruiter".

846
01:13:34,068 --> 01:13:36,447
To live, by the Golden
Rule Philosophy.

847
01:13:36,456 --> 01:13:38,617
To live, by the Golden
Rule Philosophy.

848
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:40,994
To encourage and support
my team members.

849
01:13:41,003 --> 01:13:43,219
To encourage and support
my team members.

850
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:46,529
This I pledge, as a brand
new "Star Recruiter".

851
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,517
This I pledge, as a brand
new "Star Recruiter".

852
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:52,294
Excellent. Give a round of
applause, ladies and gents.

853
01:21:18,676 --> 01:21:21,137
So right now I have a special...

854
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:24,406
for you, it's fifty
percent off any product,

855
01:21:24,432 --> 01:21:28,031
when you spend $ 40 or more
on beauty essential products.

856
01:21:28,978 --> 01:21:30,465
Which is really good.

857
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:36,937
You had mentioned a
lipstick you wanted to try?

858
01:21:36,963 --> 01:21:38,618
- Sure.
- Okay.

859
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,677
Are you alright, dear?

860
01:21:56,174 --> 01:21:57,067
Honey?

861
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:03,966
Can I help you with something?

862
01:22:10,266 --> 01:22:11,329
Dear?

863
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,087
Hey, baby.

864
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,000
Have you been sitting
here since I left?

865
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:38,424
Where were you?

866
01:22:41,342 --> 01:22:42,889
Were you with RJ?

867
01:22:44,448 --> 01:22:45,550
Yeah.

868
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:50,581
You think I'm such a fool.

869
01:22:51,698 --> 01:22:53,104
What are you talking about?

870
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:55,682
Come on.

871
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,295
I know what you've been doing.

872
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,577
My heart is broken, Chris.

873
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,659
And I think I've always known.

874
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,081
But I hid it in the back
of my mind, because...

875
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:22,457
I thought, I could trust you.

876
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:29,120
You need to come clean.

877
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:34,284
- You need to be honest with me.
- What's wrong?

878
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:43,190
- I saw you. Chris.
- You saw what?

879
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:49,813
And you call yourself
a man of faith ?

880
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:57,678
I saw you...

881
01:23:58,588 --> 01:24:01,229
with your friend RJ.

882
01:24:01,947 --> 01:24:04,610
At that hotel, just
ten blocks from here.

883
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:11,060
You kissed him.

884
01:24:12,273 --> 01:24:13,928
The way you kiss me.

885
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:22,170
I'm so stupid.

886
01:24:24,128 --> 01:24:26,065
Because all the
signs were there.

887
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,434
They were just there...
and I ignored them.

888
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,663
- I'm so stupid.
- No.

889
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:36,338
No.

890
01:24:42,549 --> 01:24:45,432
God only knows, what you do, when
you're out, travelling for work.

891
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:49,098
In one city after the
next, staying in hotels,

892
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:50,576
meeting strangers.

893
01:24:51,606 --> 01:24:54,197
- Have there been others?
- No.

894
01:24:57,697 --> 01:24:59,056
I don't believe you.

895
01:25:00,287 --> 01:25:02,873
- I don't believe a word you say. No one?
- Emily.

896
01:25:05,086 --> 01:25:06,712
There's been nobody else.

897
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:13,884
Have you been going to
see him in Seattle?

898
01:25:14,596 --> 01:25:15,213
No.

899
01:25:17,027 --> 01:25:18,767
I haven't seen him
since my mission.

900
01:25:20,274 --> 01:25:21,485
Since your mission.

901
01:25:22,341 --> 01:25:23,134
Hmm...

902
01:25:26,707 --> 01:25:28,582
I couldn't imagine
what that was like.

903
01:25:31,371 --> 01:25:33,290
What about me and Kelly?

904
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:37,059
- Has that thought ever crossed your mind?
- Yes

905
01:25:39,963 --> 01:25:41,488
Yes, of course.

906
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:46,879
I'm so sorry, Emily.

907
01:25:58,181 --> 01:25:59,841
Can we pray this away ?

908
01:26:02,298 --> 01:26:04,227
It's the last thing we can do.

909
01:26:05,006 --> 01:26:06,923
I will do, whatever it takes.

910
01:26:08,366 --> 01:26:10,528
But you have to stop this.

911
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:13,523
I need you.

912
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,907
I need you. Chris.

913
01:26:20,966 --> 01:26:22,009
What do we do?

914
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:34,466
What can I not give you...

915
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:36,098
that he can?

916
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,717
Please don't ask me that!

917
01:26:42,055 --> 01:26:43,945
I have been devoted to you.

918
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:45,942
And this family.

919
01:26:47,098 --> 01:26:49,444
The feelings that
I have for him...

920
01:26:50,817 --> 01:26:52,594
I can never have for a woman.

921
01:26:56,707 --> 01:26:58,981
Seeing him again, brought
everything back.

922
01:27:02,332 --> 01:27:03,712
And I have tried,

923
01:27:04,832 --> 01:27:07,688
to become something, that I
thought I was supposed to be.

924
01:27:07,912 --> 01:27:09,078
But I can't.

925
01:27:12,074 --> 01:27:13,254
I failed you.

926
01:27:15,969 --> 01:27:17,195
I failed you.

927
01:27:25,393 --> 01:27:27,144
I don't know what
to do with that.

928
01:27:34,233 --> 01:27:35,985
I will not accept that.

929
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:41,711
You made a promise to me.

930
01:27:42,579 --> 01:27:44,098
For eternity.

931
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:49,840
Is that what you want, Chris?

932
01:27:51,319 --> 01:27:52,715
A life without me?

933
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,263
Destroying me?

934
01:28:04,055 --> 01:28:05,451
Destroying us?

935
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:20,880
If that's what you
want, Chris...

936
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,533
You have to tell your family.

937
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:36,603
And tell them what?

938
01:28:39,228 --> 01:28:40,204
The truth.

939
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:15,566
Hey guys.

940
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,312
- Come on in.
- How are you darling?

941
01:29:18,742 --> 01:29:19,508
Good.

942
01:29:23,666 --> 01:29:24,599
Have a seat, please.

943
01:29:29,732 --> 01:29:33,106
So, what's the big news, guys?

944
01:29:33,573 --> 01:29:35,433
We're still waiting on one person.

945
01:29:37,059 --> 01:29:38,644
Chris, who?

946
01:29:50,141 --> 01:29:52,499
Hey, come on in.

947
01:29:57,932 --> 01:29:58,760
- It's okay.

948
01:29:59,605 --> 01:30:00,944
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

949
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:16,697
This is my friend, RJ.

950
01:30:18,925 --> 01:30:20,134
Hey.

951
01:30:24,615 --> 01:30:26,232
What is he doing here?

952
01:30:26,508 --> 01:30:27,842
I wanted him here.

953
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:31,033
Trust me, okay?

954
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:35,338
So, how do you know
Chris and Emily, RJ?

955
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:38,478
- I'm just a friend.
- Okay.

956
01:30:39,714 --> 01:30:41,349
I've known Chris for a while.

957
01:30:42,828 --> 01:30:45,064
- That's great.
- Yeah.

958
01:30:49,814 --> 01:30:51,068
- So what's going on?

959
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:52,896
Ehm...

960
01:30:55,257 --> 01:30:57,807
Chris and I have something,
we'd like to tell you.

961
01:31:07,651 --> 01:31:10,037
This isn't easy for me to say.

962
01:31:12,357 --> 01:31:15,818
But I haven't been completely
honest with any of you.

963
01:31:17,631 --> 01:31:20,217
And I feel like I
should come clean.

964
01:31:29,175 --> 01:31:30,017
I...

965
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:33,424
I... I'm...

966
01:31:45,006 --> 01:31:46,163
I'm gay.

967
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,112
I'm in love with him.

968
01:32:08,993 --> 01:32:10,161
Chris.

969
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:16,661
I know that you love Emily.

970
01:32:17,347 --> 01:32:18,323
But...

971
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:23,954
I guess, I just always kind
of assumed, you know ?

972
01:32:27,689 --> 01:32:28,831
I do love you.

973
01:32:30,499 --> 01:32:31,987
And I want you...

974
01:32:33,265 --> 01:32:34,526
Both of you...

975
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,022
to be happy.

976
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:38,956
Thank you.

977
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,042
Son, we can work this through.

978
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:45,495
We can work this through again.

979
01:32:48,109 --> 01:32:49,120
Again?

980
01:32:51,135 --> 01:32:52,210
You...

981
01:32:53,214 --> 01:32:55,327
You are a homewrecker !

982
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:00,807
Please make him leave.

983
01:33:01,419 --> 01:33:02,803
I don't understand why.

984
01:33:02,866 --> 01:33:04,797
Why did you invite him
here, in the first place?

985
01:33:04,823 --> 01:33:05,882
I need him here.

986
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:08,336
- I'm gonna leave.
- No.

987
01:33:08,511 --> 01:33:10,008
I think you should.

988
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,707
I knew who you were, as soon as
you walked through that door

989
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:14,006
and I think you should get up

990
01:33:14,032 --> 01:33:16,237
and walk out, and
never come back.

991
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:19,115
Chris, I feel like this
is a family matter.

992
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:23,724
I.. I don't even understand
why I'm here.

993
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,338
Yeah, neither do I.

994
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:28,851
I think you should do exactly
what my father said.

995
01:33:28,877 --> 01:33:31,379
- And you should go!
- Greg, sit down!

996
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:34,416
Chris!

997
01:33:37,283 --> 01:33:41,287
How could you do this to Mom
and Dad, and let alone Emily?

998
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:43,767
What are you thinking man?

999
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:48,537
This has nothing
to do with them.

1000
01:33:54,956 --> 01:33:58,460
My brother is not gay.

1001
01:33:58,486 --> 01:34:00,025
- I've known him my whole life.

1002
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,798
- I would know.
- Okay.

1003
01:34:02,071 --> 01:34:04,767
- RJ. RJ.
- I'm so sorry too.

1004
01:34:05,576 --> 01:34:06,328
Greg.

1005
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:08,828
Greg!

1006
01:34:11,216 --> 01:34:13,883
- Please sit down.
- Greg! Greg!

1007
01:34:15,077 --> 01:34:19,168
- Sit down!
- Greg, please sit down.

1008
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:32,530
Emily, honey, I'd love to know
your thoughts on all this.

1009
01:34:37,326 --> 01:34:40,759
I love you. I feel like
a failure, as a wife.

1010
01:34:40,937 --> 01:34:41,485
No.

1011
01:34:43,297 --> 01:34:45,235
But I'm not ready
to give up yet.

1012
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:52,340
So... you're gay and
you're in love with a man.

1013
01:34:57,318 --> 01:35:00,730
That doesn't explain or
answer to me how you're...

1014
01:35:01,543 --> 01:35:03,933
you're going to leave your wife!

1015
01:35:04,468 --> 01:35:05,902
Abandon me!

1016
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:08,703
And your daughter.

1017
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,710
Your family, your church,
your Heavenly Father.

1018
01:35:13,991 --> 01:35:15,335
All, so that you can just...

1019
01:35:15,526 --> 01:35:18,781
have some momentary
self-indulgent fling!

1020
01:35:21,753 --> 01:35:23,390
This is about who I am.

1021
01:35:27,714 --> 01:35:29,691
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

1022
01:35:31,222 --> 01:35:33,316
But I hope, one day,
you can understand.

1023
01:35:35,288 --> 01:35:39,151
And you can help me, to
help Kaylee to understand.

1024
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:46,459
- But this is something I have to do.
- No...

1025
01:35:46,588 --> 01:35:47,825
- Honey?
- No...

1026
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,522
you do not abandon me.

1027
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,266
You have to let me go.

1028
01:35:57,884 --> 01:35:58,593
No.

1029
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:05,727
No, honey.

1030
01:36:07,402 --> 01:36:08,111
No.

1031
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,664
No. No. Never!

1032
01:36:13,875 --> 01:36:15,879
I can not let you go.

1033
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:20,977
Why did you do this to me !?

1034
01:36:27,145 --> 01:36:29,176
I do not do it to hurt you

1035
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:36,489
This is not the case, dear...

1036
01:36:37,529 --> 01:36:38,981
I hate you!

1037
01:36:39,033 --> 01:36:41,141
You get out of my house!

1038
01:36:58,437 --> 01:36:59,317
Hi.

1039
01:37:15,106 --> 01:37:16,635
You know my dad
never told my mum

1040
01:37:16,661 --> 01:37:18,315
about what happened
on our mission?

1041
01:37:20,404 --> 01:37:21,629
He kept it from her.

1042
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:27,145
She could barely
look at me, today.

1043
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:37,533
My dad's asked me to write a
letter to everyone we know,

1044
01:37:37,621 --> 01:37:38,918
telling them the truth.

1045
01:37:42,429 --> 01:37:43,582
I'm gonna do it.

1046
01:37:47,235 --> 01:37:49,961
I'm gonna honor him, and do it.

1047
01:38:00,578 --> 01:38:03,581
I'm gonna wait till after the anniversary
party and then, send them off.

1048
01:38:03,829 --> 01:38:04,773
One by one.

1049
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:32,684
Hello?

1050
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:36,699
- Is this Thomas Smith?
- Yes, it is.

1051
01:38:37,609 --> 01:38:39,403
Hello Thomas, this
is Noah Merrill,

1052
01:38:39,429 --> 01:38:41,217
I'm calling you from
Salt Lake City.

1053
01:38:42,109 --> 01:38:44,526
Yes, I know who you
are, of course.

1054
01:38:44,921 --> 01:38:47,163
Ehm, to what do I owe the honor?

1055
01:38:47,976 --> 01:38:50,173
Well, I'm afraid
this call is ehm...

1056
01:38:50,363 --> 01:38:53,782
regarding a rather...
sensitive issue.

1057
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:54,870
Ehm, sure.

1058
01:38:55,206 --> 01:38:56,911
What is this regarding?

1059
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:00,654
Several years ago, your
son RJ and my son Chris

1060
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,203
were mission companions.

1061
01:39:03,368 --> 01:39:04,407
I see.

1062
01:39:06,299 --> 01:39:07,979
And I don't know, if
you knew this, but...

1063
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,694
RJ is currently in
Salt Lake City.

1064
01:39:11,088 --> 01:39:13,482
No. I didn't know that.

1065
01:39:15,132 --> 01:39:16,213
Well...

1066
01:39:16,908 --> 01:39:18,818
he is, and ehm...

1067
01:39:19,999 --> 01:39:23,525
he's complicating things
for Chris and his wife.

1068
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:27,103
They've been meeting at a
hotel, near Chris' home.

1069
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,615
and ehm.. I just think it
would be good if you...

1070
01:39:32,023 --> 01:39:35,572
were to call RJ and convince
him, to go back to Seattle.

1071
01:39:37,202 --> 01:39:38,304
Brother Merrill, I...

1072
01:39:39,031 --> 01:39:41,147
I know, this must be
difficult for you, but...

1073
01:39:41,609 --> 01:39:43,101
RJ is a grown man.

1074
01:39:43,628 --> 01:39:46,328
I can call him and ask him to
leave Salt Lake City, but...

1075
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:47,830
that doesn't mean he'll go.

1076
01:39:48,026 --> 01:39:50,288
Thomas, Chris and his wife are

1077
01:39:50,314 --> 01:39:52,321
thinking about
getting a divorce.

1078
01:39:54,387 --> 01:39:58,014
He's been doing great,
he's come so far.

1079
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,837
Your son has just...

1080
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:04,604
he brings confusion in the
spirit of Chris' life, and

1081
01:40:05,938 --> 01:40:07,482
I hate to say it, but I really

1082
01:40:07,508 --> 01:40:10,380
I think it was RJ, who seduced
Chris on his mission trip.

1083
01:40:10,406 --> 01:40:14,337
Again: I'm sorry for what you and
your familyare going through.

1084
01:40:14,363 --> 01:40:18,886
But to put the blame solely
on RJ, it's just not fair.

1085
01:40:19,238 --> 01:40:22,851
Your son is a part of
this, as much as RJ.

1086
01:40:22,877 --> 01:40:23,939
You know that.

1087
01:40:24,398 --> 01:40:27,347
Chris was fine until RJ
showed up at his door.

1088
01:40:27,628 --> 01:40:28,253
Noah,

1089
01:40:29,007 --> 01:40:32,413
I think you and I are a lot more
similar than we might guess.

1090
01:40:32,498 --> 01:40:34,668
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1091
01:40:34,694 --> 01:40:37,630
What kind of a father would let his
son parade around as a pansy ?

1092
01:40:37,775 --> 01:40:40,236
Now, hang on just one minute!

1093
01:40:42,057 --> 01:40:45,015
I'm very sorry for what you and
your family are going through,

1094
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:47,631
but my son is a good boy.

1095
01:40:48,068 --> 01:40:51,723
He's a good boy and whatever is
happening in Salt Lake City,

1096
01:40:51,749 --> 01:40:55,713
is being reciprocated by your son,
or else, RJ would have left by now!

1097
01:40:59,209 --> 01:41:01,209
I am proud of my son.

1098
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:04,721
And, this hasn't been
easy on me, but...

1099
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:07,603
I love him, so much.

1100
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:11,963
And he struggled too.

1101
01:41:12,536 --> 01:41:13,894
As has Chris.

1102
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:20,443
RJ has been on a very
powerful spiritual journey...

1103
01:41:20,721 --> 01:41:22,783
to come to peace,
with who he is...

1104
01:41:23,705 --> 01:41:25,713
no matter what the
church says about it.

1105
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:29,600
And Brenda and I...

1106
01:41:31,553 --> 01:41:32,982
we've started our journey.

1107
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:35,912
And now, brother Merrill...

1108
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:39,182
you and your family
have to begin yours

1109
01:41:41,619 --> 01:41:45,948
And if you ever say anything
bad about my son again...

1110
01:41:46,994 --> 01:41:48,588
you and I are gonna
have a problem.

1111
01:41:49,564 --> 01:41:50,642
Do you understand me?

1112
01:42:14,151 --> 01:42:14,860
Chris.

1113
01:43:56,849 --> 01:43:58,583
Why did I see him ?!

1114
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:36,990
Now I see the damage I've done.

1115
01:44:38,052 --> 01:44:40,638
I'm holding on to
something from my past.

1116
01:44:41,164 --> 01:44:42,693
It's not just Chris.

1117
01:44:42,749 --> 01:44:45,467
It's everything that's locked
in me that's L.D.S.

1134
01:47:09,586 --> 01:47:11,867
Well, I just wanted
to start by saying

1135
01:47:11,868 --> 01:47:15,700
welcome to my family and
to my favourite people.

1136
01:47:15,815 --> 01:47:19,700
What else can I say but congratulations.
I love you both.

1137
01:47:21,761 --> 01:47:23,296
Well, let's get
uncle Noah appear.

1138
01:47:23,322 --> 01:47:25,939
I think he has something
he wants to say to us all.

1139
01:47:36,517 --> 01:47:37,368
Thank you.

1140
01:47:40,478 --> 01:47:42,892
I want to thank you all
for coming here tonight.

1141
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:48,470
It is the 25th year, that
I've spent with my soul mate,

1142
01:47:48,847 --> 01:47:50,520
the love of my life,
Debra Merrill.

1143
01:47:56,199 --> 01:48:00,398
You know when I met her in a
conference centre in Cleveland, Ohio

1144
01:48:00,852 --> 01:48:04,906
I knew right away that is was more
than just a coincidence, that...

1145
01:48:05,008 --> 01:48:06,313
It was fate.

1146
01:48:08,047 --> 01:48:08,833
And...

1147
01:48:09,758 --> 01:48:10,969
I'm honoured...

1148
01:48:11,688 --> 01:48:14,383
to have such a
wonderful woman...

1149
01:48:15,832 --> 01:48:16,926
in my life.

1150
01:48:18,137 --> 01:48:19,285
And ehm...

1151
01:48:20,746 --> 01:48:23,176
and our three beautiful
children, and...

1152
01:48:24,103 --> 01:48:25,645
Emily, our daughter-in-law.

1153
01:48:28,243 --> 01:48:29,168
You see...

1154
01:48:31,016 --> 01:48:33,680
you don't get to choose, who
you love in this world.

1155
01:48:34,489 --> 01:48:37,215
Our Heavenly Father makes
those choices for us.

1156
01:48:39,766 --> 01:48:40,516
And...

1157
01:48:42,256 --> 01:48:43,575
in the end...

1158
01:48:44,802 --> 01:48:46,254
all we have, is family.

1159
01:49:02,799 --> 01:49:03,744
What are you doing?

1160
01:49:09,711 --> 01:49:11,865
- I'm leaving.
- Why?

1161
01:49:13,632 --> 01:49:15,077
You have no idea...

1162
01:49:15,884 --> 01:49:18,593
how happy I am, to have spent
this last week with you.

1163
01:49:23,078 --> 01:49:25,457
There's always a part of
me, that's gonna love you.

1164
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,914
So before I go...

1165
01:49:33,437 --> 01:49:35,031
I wanna do something for you.

1166
01:49:36,074 --> 01:49:36,711
What?

1167
01:49:48,884 --> 01:49:50,027
Forgive me.

1168
01:50:23,275 --> 01:50:25,743
I just saved you a lot
of dollars, okay?

1169
01:51:36,865 --> 01:51:39,024
Do you know yet, what you're
gonna say to your father?

1170
01:51:42,907 --> 01:51:44,497
I already told him the truth.

1171
01:51:44,989 --> 01:51:46,501
But he can't accept it.

1172
01:51:48,592 --> 01:51:51,051
So I assume, all I've left
to say is: "I'm sorry".

1173
01:52:03,744 --> 01:52:05,256
But you've already done that.

1174
01:52:16,891 --> 01:52:18,806
Honey, you can't hold this in.

1175
01:52:19,681 --> 01:52:21,349
You need to talk to somebody.

1176
01:52:26,379 --> 01:52:28,140
I'm not a good person, am I?

1177
01:52:29,172 --> 01:52:31,484
Honey, of course you are.

1178
01:52:33,093 --> 01:52:35,429
I don't think this was a
surprise, to any of us.

1179
01:52:36,449 --> 01:52:38,549
Don't you think,
your dad is upset because he's...

1180
01:52:38,575 --> 01:52:39,973
shocked by this?

1181
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:42,665
No.

1182
01:52:43,477 --> 01:52:44,164
No.

1183
01:52:46,028 --> 01:52:47,723
I need you to
understand something.

1184
01:52:47,749 --> 01:52:49,481
Mom, can we please
talk about this later?

1185
01:52:49,545 --> 01:52:50,296
No.

1186
01:52:50,926 --> 01:52:51,426
No.

1187
01:52:52,106 --> 01:52:53,926
We need to talk about this now.

1188
01:52:54,506 --> 01:52:56,672
You need to
understand something.

1189
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:00,703
- You made these choices.
- Okay, Mom.

1190
01:53:00,729 --> 01:53:02,770
No, you don't listen.

1191
01:53:03,311 --> 01:53:05,525
I can't stand as a human being.

1192
01:53:06,418 --> 01:53:08,295
You made the choice...

1193
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:10,179
to go on a mission.

1194
01:53:11,275 --> 01:53:13,861
You made the choice to get
married in the temple.

1195
01:53:14,653 --> 01:53:16,536
And these choices, honey...

1196
01:53:17,673 --> 01:53:19,501
they gave your father hope.

1197
01:53:20,991 --> 01:53:22,868
They gave me hope too.

1198
01:53:26,204 --> 01:53:27,517
Oh, honey,

1199
01:53:28,583 --> 01:53:30,888
All we have in this
life is each other.

1200
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:33,403
- You know that?
- Yeah.

1201
01:53:34,056 --> 01:53:36,522
And honey, I love...
I love our life

1202
01:53:36,548 --> 01:53:39,204
And I love our family,
our eternal family...

1203
01:53:40,196 --> 01:53:43,157
and I love being L.D.S.

1204
01:53:43,836 --> 01:53:45,649
And I love our Heavenly Father.

1205
01:53:47,473 --> 01:53:49,437
I know, this has been
so hard for you.

1206
01:53:52,266 --> 01:53:53,504
But let me tell you...

1207
01:53:53,934 --> 01:53:56,091
as hard as this is,
you have to know,

1208
01:53:56,117 --> 01:53:58,263
that you are a child of God.

1209
01:53:58,987 --> 01:54:01,394
You are, and He loves you.

1210
01:54:02,538 --> 01:54:04,523
And if He can't accept you,

1211
01:54:04,885 --> 01:54:06,297
the way that you are.

1212
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:09,416
just the way,He made you,

1213
01:54:11,658 --> 01:54:13,063
I let you know, I will.

1214
01:54:15,674 --> 01:54:17,682
Okay?
I will.

1215
01:54:21,444 --> 01:54:24,127
And your father will come around.
He will.

1216
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,897
I've really hurt Emily, though.

1217
01:54:30,061 --> 01:54:31,889
Honey, she's gonna
need some time.

1218
01:54:32,561 --> 01:54:33,305
Okay?

1219
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:35,068
And you'll give her that.

1220
01:54:37,151 --> 01:54:40,939
But right now you need
to work on Chris, okay?

1221
01:54:42,309 --> 01:54:43,560
Give her some time.

1222
01:54:45,241 --> 01:54:47,827
And then, you can help her.

1223
01:54:48,597 --> 01:54:51,311
And help Kaylee to understand,
what she's going through.

1224
01:54:51,497 --> 01:54:53,338
And what is happening
around her.

1225
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:54,426
Okay?

1226
01:54:57,016 --> 01:54:58,399
My boy...

1227
01:55:09,747 --> 01:55:11,996
- I love you.
- I love you.

1228
01:55:13,134 --> 01:55:14,946
- It's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

1229
01:55:48,819 --> 01:55:51,497
Whatever that stunt was,
you pulled last night...

1230
01:55:54,579 --> 01:55:58,037
it's made the 20 years,
that I've given the church,

1231
01:55:58,594 --> 01:55:59,512
mean nothing.

1232
01:56:00,551 --> 01:56:01,745
Nothing at all.

1233
01:56:02,172 --> 01:56:03,816
Of course they meant something.

1234
01:56:09,265 --> 01:56:12,050
And you broke that poor
girl's heart, with your lies.

1235
01:56:12,514 --> 01:56:13,875
You know that, right?

1236
01:56:15,732 --> 01:56:17,733
And I've raised
you, to be honest.

1237
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,564
To be honest, I would have
to admit, to being gay.

1238
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:26,412
I've been praying this
away, since I was a child.

1239
01:56:28,897 --> 01:56:31,326
I've been guilty every
day of my life.

1240
01:56:31,352 --> 01:56:32,828
Do you really want
me, to live the rest

1241
01:56:32,854 --> 01:56:34,507
of my life,
feeling this way?

1242
01:56:36,757 --> 01:56:38,687
If it means your
loyalty to God...

1243
01:56:41,553 --> 01:56:42,871
Then yes, I do.

1244
01:56:49,148 --> 01:56:51,102
- I have to go, Chris.
- Dad?

1245
01:56:51,726 --> 01:56:52,552
I have to go.

1246
01:56:52,858 --> 01:56:55,105
Can we please finish
this conversation?

1247
01:56:58,663 --> 01:57:00,763
We have nothing left to discuss.

1248
01:57:14,851 --> 01:57:16,016
Chris, what are you doing?

1249
01:57:16,042 --> 01:57:19,143
I am not letting you leave, without
finishing this conversation.

1250
01:57:19,956 --> 01:57:22,259
So you're embarrassed
to have a gay son?

1251
01:57:23,924 --> 01:57:26,128
Yes, I'm embarrassed
to have a gay son.

1252
01:57:26,154 --> 01:57:26,799
Why?

1253
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:31,600
Cause it goes
against God's Laws.

1254
01:57:32,005 --> 01:57:33,612
I am your child.

1255
01:57:34,716 --> 01:57:36,139
I'm your son!

1256
01:57:41,207 --> 01:57:43,695
I live to make you proud.

1257
01:57:43,721 --> 01:57:46,197
I've manufactured
my entire life,

1258
01:57:46,223 --> 01:57:48,400
to please you,
because I love you.

1259
01:57:50,339 --> 01:57:52,418
Because I am proud of my father.

1260
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,941
You're breaking my heart, Dad.

1261
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:05,054
Please don't walk away from me.

1262
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:09,540
Because I can't do
this without you.

1263
01:58:12,394 --> 01:58:15,047
You taught me to tell the
truth, no matter what.

1264
01:58:15,316 --> 01:58:18,519
And I'm finally doing that,
and you don't like it.

1265
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:25,027
But I'm doing exactly what
you taught me to do.

1266
01:58:45,355 --> 01:58:47,191
I just want you to
have a good life.

1267
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:50,207
I don't want you to struggle.

1268
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:56,215
All I ever wanted, was to
make life easy for you.

1269
01:58:58,348 --> 01:59:01,136
I can't give you a second
helping with this.

1270
01:59:03,265 --> 01:59:05,007
I'm gonna be okay, Dad.

1271
01:59:08,758 --> 01:59:10,540
Everything is going to change.

1272
01:59:12,918 --> 01:59:15,519
But I promise you, I'm
going to be okay.

1273
01:59:47,308 --> 01:59:49,359
After the anniversary dinner,

1274
01:59:50,357 --> 01:59:52,086
the last thing I expected

1275
01:59:52,203 --> 01:59:54,095
was a letter from Chris.

1276
01:59:55,647 --> 01:59:57,390
He said many things.

1277
01:59:58,452 --> 02:00:01,401
But what stood out to
me, was three words:

1278
02:00:02,716 --> 02:00:03,928
I forgive you.

1279
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:09,172
You see, I love Salt Lake.

1280
02:00:09,435 --> 02:00:10,788
Trying to convince myself,

1281
02:00:11,252 --> 02:00:14,073
that never seeing him
again, is for the best.

1282
02:00:15,626 --> 02:00:16,877
But in my heart...

1283
02:00:17,842 --> 02:00:19,400
I know it's not an issue...

1284
02:00:19,722 --> 02:00:21,306
of if I'll see him again.

1285
02:00:25,075 --> 02:00:25,946
