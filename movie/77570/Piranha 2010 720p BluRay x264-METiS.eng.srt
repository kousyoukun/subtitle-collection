00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,729
Catch you.

00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:53,031
Come on! Come on!

6
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:55,488
Look at that

7
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:56,831
Son of a bitch

8
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,849
Help!

9
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,064
Help!

10
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:52,866
今天天气温和，这里是维多利亚湖

11
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,118
“美丽湖畔假期”现场，欢乐写在每个游客脸上

12
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,607
当你今天早上醒来... ...不只是派对，而且

13
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:05,295
维多利亚湖好似成了太阳

14
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:08,930
会见证到一些奇特的事，而不只是

15
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,881
" 你好吗:春节假期"

16
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,310
Obvious,it was a mistake.  Can't we just work something out here?

17
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:23,843
Mistake or no mistake,  you just destroyed private property.

18
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:26,492
And from the smell of your breath, I suggest you take the ticket.

19
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,106
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

20
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,218
I don't know,  I thought you'd drive me home.

21
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,790
Touching an officers  uniform is considered an assault?

22
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,210
Were you aware of that?

23
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,863
Come on.You look pretty hot in tan.

24
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
It's not tan, it's beige!

25
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,619
Hey, take it easy!

26
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:48,192
Another step and you'll  pissing lightning bolts into next week, ok?

27
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:07,738
Pretty much your average day in college

28
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,851
Hey Kelly, I wasn't  sure you'd be coming back.

29
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:11,887
for spring break

30
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:13,423
Yeah, I'm here

31
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,877
I can only assume you're down here to get on one of those boats

32
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:21,604
No, I came down here to pick up my little sister for music lessons.

33
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:22,871
How about yourself?

34
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:27,211
I'm just waiting for my ride.  Todd and his friends, we're gonna go check out some music.

35
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,092
Todd Dupree?

36
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:31,319
Remind me who you're going out with again?

37
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:34,046
You gotta have standards ok, thats all I'm saying

38
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,118
Todd's a really good DJ.

39
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:43,340
Kelly! Let's go. Jump in we're late.

40
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,717
Listen,he says he's got  backstage passes for  Planners.

41
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:48,909
you should come

42
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,402
I would, but I'm pretty much under house arrest with Shing Tsing and Laura.

43
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:53,670
Too bad

44
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,205
We'll miss you.

45
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,817
Anyways,I gotta go. - Come on, let's go!

46
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:01,889
I hope to see you again before you...

47
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,115
... before you leave.Pretty smooth,Jake.

48
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,992
Hey asswipe! Cool shirt!

49
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,090
Nice horn. Thanks

50
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:23,972
Nice boobs

51
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,161
Thanks

52
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,200
I have a training bra  but I don't like to wear it, it itches.

53
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,846
Tell me about it.

54
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,610
Who are you waiting for?

55
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,529
My brother Jake. He's 17.

56
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:38,988
And he'll like your boobs too. - They all do.

57
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,524
Come on, let's go.

58
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:41,830
What happened to you?

59
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,941
I don't want to talk  about it, ok. Let's go.

60
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:45,171
Hi Jake.

61
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,399
Try to not stare at her boobs.

62
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:48,743
Shut up.

63
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,239
I like your shirt.

64
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,044
Why? You wanna throw something at me too?

65
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,694
No, actually I like The Pixies.

66
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,652
Danni, Danni, Danni, where  the hell is Crystal?

67
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:58,996
She's over there with Andrew.

68
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,377
She went to get some sunscreen.

69
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,377
Sunscreen?

70
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,258
Andrew, Crystal, we don't  need sunscreen.

71
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:05,908
We need body paint, condoms.  We need Ready Whip

72
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:12,591
Tell her to come tomorrow  I want bleach blonde booty at the marina. 
I gotta get  my first shot off by noon.

73
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,435
Make sure those titties are nice and perky!

74
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,546
Who's this?

75
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:19,197
This is Jake. He's a local.

76
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,075
Sandrat huh? You know your way around the lake? -Yes.

77
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,608
You wanna job? I'll pay you cash money.

78
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,375
Don't bullshit Jake.

79
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,680
My guide didn't show and I need somebody asap.

80
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,597
I need someone with ambition,  someone who is willing to take chances ...

81
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,633
... If, you, know, what, I, mean.

82
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,399
Mr, you talk funny.

83
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:41,510
Yeah, well, you're short! 

84
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Hold on, - This is Derick

85
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,846
Don't you disappoint  me motherfucker. I told you!

86
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:51,111
I want the biggest Goddam  boat this podunk town has to offer

87
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,533
Who is that?

88
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,028
Derick? He's the director.

89
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:58,561
So you're like a, er.. actress or what?

90
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,750
I am a 'Wild Wild Girl'.

91
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:04,667
What's a 'Wild Wild Girl', Jake?

92
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,583
Of course we know boats!  Fuck the waiver! You signed the waiver!

93
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,081
So, Jake baby, are we gonna do this?

94
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,652
Do what? - The job! Location scout!  Get us around, show us the spots...

95
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,725
the G-spots. I need a local.

96
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:19,339
I need you.

97
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,488
We're talking about life lesson here Jake.

98
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,367
Great, 10am, tomorrow. Don't be late.

99
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:28,901
And... wear a different shirt

100
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:31,090
I we'll see you tomorrow Jake.

101
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,203
Actually, tomorrow he's...

102
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:08,341
-Jake Why'd you bother to knock,  if you're just gonna walk straight in?

103
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:09,994
Am I disturbing you?

104
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:15,370
No, I'm just doing homework, and research for school.

105
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,131
Laura has been telling me that you may have some other plans for tomorrow

106
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,283
I don't know what she's talking  about. I'm 100% baby-sitting.

107
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,970


108
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:27,351
What? No, we don't want babysitter.

109
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,618
Yeah mum. Especially not Jake.

110
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:33,266
I'm serious, mum, we dont need one.

111
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,110
Out, out, out.

112
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,870
Jake, you know I don't have a backup.

113
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:45,632
I know mum. Don't worry, you know how crazy this week is for you.

114
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:48,398
And dont worry, I'll take care of the nitwits, ok?

115
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:52,699
Remember, if you do not fulfill their responsibilities, 
I have power to arrest

116
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,657
and imprison you.

117
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:57,998
Mum, I'm not 12. playing on the sheriff card doesn't work.

118
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,533
No? - No!

119
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,569
Like I said, I'll take care of them, ok?

120
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,257
Alright.

121
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:09,788
Now get outta here  
-I promise next year I'll try to find another solution.

122
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Alright? - Alright.

123
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:22,001
Oh and Jake. -Come on Mum! Really?

124
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,152
It's time for dinner.

125
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,071
OK, alright, I'll be right there.

126
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:53,953
Hope I didn't wake the kids?

127
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,912
They'll sleep through anything.

128
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:59,099
So, Maggy said yesterday was the last time she saw him?

129
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,675
Yeah, just before noon.

130
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:03,132
She said Matt took a boat to catch some bass.

131
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:05,628
She drove around the lake all night looking for him.

132
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,509
Where's the boat? - Over there.

133
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:21,719
Feeling like a skinny dip?

134
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,137
Yeah, if we can make it to the end of the pier

135
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:26,828
You mean I'm to old, or too heavy?

136
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:28,633
I think you're too chicken-shit!

137
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,971
By the way, Gordon called last night.

138
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:35,124
Yeah?

139
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:39,156
He said that U.S.G.S. recorded heavy seismic activity below the lake.

140
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,423
Really?

141
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:43,111
Yeah, they're sending in a team of seismologist divers

142
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,374
And he told them that you're gonna escort them out!

143
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,949
Jesus Christ.

144
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,176
We've just been invaded by 20,000 kids

145
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,173
makes us a little busy at the moment.

146
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,479
I know. That's what I told him

147
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,500
[creaking]

148
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,120
This doesnt sound too good

149
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,293
So, what time are the divers gonna get here?

150
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,945
He said around 10.

151
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,301
Shit.

152
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,830
Come on, just a little more.

153
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:45,710
I can't get it

154
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,020
- Jules!

155
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:55,964
Give me your hand!

156
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,757
Do you think a propeller could've done this?

157
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,832
I doubt it. Look at the bones. Nothing broken

158
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,864
It looks like toxic, are acidic decomposition

159
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,129
it's as it this body has been in the water for weeks

160
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,891
What would you say if I told that I'm thinking about closing the lake?

161
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:23,846
...at least until we get an autopsy report  
- An autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days

162
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,225
It'd be easier to drain this lake, than close it.

163
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,606
I's a big financial week for our town.

164
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm gettin too old for this

165
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,691
We're not liying to mum.  - Yeah, we won't lie to mum.

166
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:45,263
Come on guys, every year it's the same.  
I'm stuck here with you

167
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:46,760
and miss all the spring break fun.

168
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,412
You mean spring break boobies!

169
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,947
What if I give you guys the cash for the baby-sitting?

170
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,329
Sixty bucks and you gotta deal.

171
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,019
Sixty? But I'm only getting paid forty.

172
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:56,285
Twenty dollar deception surcharge!

173
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,580
Don't pick up the phone, don't answer the door

174
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,347
and don't leave the house.

175
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,920
OK? I'm counting on you guys.

176
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,264
Alright?

177
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Town rules son. 
You throw a peice of trash in the lake, you gotta pick up 10 peices

178
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:45,558
After the dive, our presence is requested at 'Cocomos' 
The Arizona State cheerleading team.

179
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,247
Hi, I'm Sheriff Forester.

180
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,359
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

181
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,741
It's nice to have a welcoming committee around here

182
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:53,661
I assume that's technical equipment too?

183
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:55,351
Yeah, Sam, give those back.

184
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,769
According to the epicenter coordinates

185
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:01,534
we need to go here.

186
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,450
Ok, that's about 20 minutes out

187
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,333
Ready when you are. -Alright

188
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,360
You dont see many women working Law Enforcement out here in cowboy country.

189
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
You dont see a lot of cowboys though

190
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
Kelly.

191
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Jake.

192
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,172
Who exactly are you baby-sitting here?

193
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,820
This is a funny story actually.

194
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,854


195
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:06,271
Wow. Look at those idiots.

196
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:07,692
Yeah, it's terrible.

197
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,378
Sandrat! Hey Sandrat, I'm talking to you.

198
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:15,410
Where the hell have you been? 
We've got the girls lubed up

199
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,791
We're ready to roll. I'm docking your paycheck!

200
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,213
Let's go.

201
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,935
Now I see what you've been scouting last 15 minutes.

202
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:28,967
Kelly, it was great to see you, I know you gotta get going...

203
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,811
Hi Kelly, I'm Derick Jones.

204
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:32,271
Hi

205
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,114
You know this guy?

206
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:37,071
 Jake? Jake is my boy!

207
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,259
He's the man with the plan! The insight, the knowledge!

208
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,062
Great. Those girls, they aren't with you are they?

209
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:47,056
Yes, why? Are you into girls?

210
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,706
No, I'm just showing him around town. 
All the hotspots, stuff like that.

211
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,582
The job is called location scout, and Kelly you should come with us.

212
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:58,040
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

213
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,151
No, she's got other plans already.

214
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,418
Kelly do you like champagne?

215
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:10,713
I love champagne, actually I love ...

216
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:13,171
I would love to come on your boat Derek, thanks.

217
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,007
Come on, let me... let me help you aboard.

218
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,722
Hey Kelly baby. What happened to hanging with us today?

219
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,294
Who's that guy? Is he your boyfriend or something?  
- No, he's just a boy from school...

220
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,444
 ...who said he has back-stage passes, when actually, he doesn't!

221
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,288
- Have a good day! - Come on Kelly!

222
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,747
You have these T-shirts.

223
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:44,471
What the fuck.

224
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:47,081
That was Derick Jones!

225
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,560
Is that Jake Forester?

226
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:06,361
See you at 4 in wet t-shirt contest.

227
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,126
Dave, we have to talk about this

228
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:10,701
We told Jake that we'd stay at the house.

229
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:13,119
I told him that I would fish.

230
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:15,117
I can't if there are no fish.

231
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:16,730
The lake's too busy.

232
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,072
Come on. Sand Island is really close

233
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:31,862
I should've brought my trombone.

234
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,544
No way! "Be a girl and sunbathe or something!

235
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:40,464
When I become a rock star, just see if I let YOU be in my group!

236
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,845
Give me a break,dude!

237
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,379
You play the trombone!

238
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,200
Here we go ladies... a little Champagne...  
- Thanks ... the finest your gas station has to offer

239
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,878
Cheers!

240
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,221
to our newest 'Wild Wild Girl'

241
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:20,173
That's why we came here. Derick wants to capture innocence.

242
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,132
It's all about innocence

243
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,160
Just like her.

244
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
Don't worry. Derick's just making his play.  
You might as well ask him not to breathe

245
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:37,225
It's the rules. Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

246
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
It's like a law of physics.

247
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,027
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

248
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,023
She's not messing up your party is she?

249
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,021
What do I care. She's not my girlfriend.

250
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,168
This is great. I'm having a great time.

251
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:53,508
We're going wild, I'm going wild.

252
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:56,427
Hey, Jake. How far is this place? Come on!

253
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,654
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there

254
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,187
So speaking of going wild...

255
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:05,375
you haven't seen anything yet!

256
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,665
Why not join us?

257
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,000
Hey, what's up guys?  
- Close that door, you're ruining our shot!

258
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:54,406
Come on Sandrat. Get with the program.

259
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,080
Here they come, here they come. Here come my nymphs.

260
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,356
Oh my God!

261
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:06,233
Check it out! The fish, with boobies

262
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,036
If all fish look like that, I would fuck fish!

263
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:15,336
Looking good ladies. You like this, right Jake?

264
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,986
You should be paying us today, not the other way around!

265
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:27,279
Look at these goddess aquatic bitches. This is hot Andy!

266
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:29,046
This is so hot. This is what it's all about

267
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,271
Beer, sun and naked hunnies making out under water!

268
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:48,365
Mum, what's going on there?

269
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,973
How come you didn't pick up the home phone?

270
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,623
I've been trying to reach you.

271
00:26:57,044 --> 00:27:00,999
I was outside. I can go and get it if you need me to.

272
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
No, that's okay.

273
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:07,566
Oh my God!

274
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:08,833
What?

275
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:14,019
Nothing, just kids.

276
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:17,935
They're outside fishing...

277
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,201
... and it's really nice to see them ...

278
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:22,351
... playing with each other.

279
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:26,002
Put your ass on the glass!

280
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,650
Jake is someone there with you?

281
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,912
No, no, no. 

282
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:35,409
Just the kids on the lake. It's crazy here. You know how it is.

283
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,020
Honey, I don't want Zane or Laura near the lake today, you hear me?

284
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:43,973
Alright, we will stay in and we'll watch TV.

285
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,582
Alright, I gotta go. Thank you so much for this

286
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,348
I'll try to come home early, ok?

287
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,343
Alright, alright. I love you. I gotta go.

288
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:56,800
Kelly?

289
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,252
Kelly, where are you?

290
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,234
Kelly?

291
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,395
Jake, you missed the rest of the show.

292
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,930
Let's go. Towels for the girls.

293
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:11,457
Wow! Great! good work. Way to tie up a canoe

294
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:12,723
I must've gotten my knots mixed up.

295
00:29:14,324 --> 00:29:18,330
So you catch zero fish, and lose us our only boat. 
Today is just full of accomplishments

296
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,440
Jake's gonna kill us.

297
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,248
Somebody will see us. See, there are some boats over there.

298
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:27,435
Don't waste your time. They'll never see us, it's way too far.

299
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,236
Hello!

300
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:38,226
Hello!

301
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:55,853
We need help!

302
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,503
We're over here!

303
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,421
Help us, somebody.

304
00:30:05,532 --> 00:30:07,182
We're over here, help!

305
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,712
Woah! Look at the size of that!

306
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,901
What is it? A cavern system?

307
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,396
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

308
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,313
You see this gap here? -Yes.

309
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:17,155
The quake opened that up, now it's a connecting passage.

310
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:18,961
A lake under a lake?

311
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:21,188
That's right. Sorry but it's still your jurisdiction.

312
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:24,144
This is part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

313
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:25,949
That's the beauty of it.

314
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:27,985
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

315
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,518
I don't know why you get s o excited by that crap.

316
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,629
All we ever see is rocks and sand.

317
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:56,634
I should warn them, it's not very pretty down there.

318
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:59,246
Tourists treat this lake like it's a garbage can.

319
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:01,935
How's it going down there?

320
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,700
Sheriff said that it's a real treasure trove down there

321
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:10,115
so I've got dibs on the old body spray, and 'Jugs' magazines

322
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,534
I got dibs on home appliances.

323
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,916
I got missing college girls

324
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,600
Oh my God!

325
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,133
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

326
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:26,897
Focus on the task.

327
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:35,615
At least 200 feet Novak

328
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:42,988
Almost full visibility.

329
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:44,833
. 侨狭 轻谙 轻输且踽?

330
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,668
You should see this. It's unbelieveable!

331
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,929
Novak, you copy? - Yes, pretty good

332
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:05,303
Ok,guy.You're about 90 feet to the entrance of the connecting passage

333
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:11,178
It looks like single file time

334
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:12,557
I'll go first

335
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,840
No, I should de the preliminary scout.

336
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,477
No offense, you'll get us stuck!

337
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,397
Maybe, I'm like an eel.

338
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:21,432
Electrical eel can get into small spaces that it is shocking.

339
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,619
That's weird

340
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:27,385
Here they are and they're splitting up

341
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,681
Guys,is everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

342
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:52,116
I'm getting a serious drop in temperature

343
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,880
it's at least 30 degrees colder.

344
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:55,189
You're probably at the mouth of the underwater lake

345
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:58,607
Do you have any visual?

346
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,870
I'm entering the cave

347
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
Jesus!

348
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,909
It seems endless.

349
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
You gotta see this.

350
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:44,422
This is incredible

351
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:44,450
What do you see down there?

352
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:47,905
Something just bit me!

353
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,880
Yes, okay, I thought you like that kinda stuff?

354
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:06,456
Sam! Sam! Answer me!

355
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,520
Something's happening. 
- What?  I don't know. Give me my flippers.

356
00:36:59,223 --> 00:37:00,259
Get him out of the water!

357
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,203
Oh my God!

358
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:43,234
Your body is a temple, and now it is time to thank the Gods.

359
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,997
Andrew, camera.

360
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,994
Come on you. No, no, no.

361
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,259
No, thanks. I think I've already had too much.

362
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,880
Come on, don't you want to worship at a beautiful altar.

363
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:58,442
I know you prefer champagne, but you believe us, you can trust Crystal.

364
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:00,630
Come on Derick, she said no.

365
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,122
No, she said 'no thanks', there's a difference.  
She understands that gratitude is the right attitude.

366
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:11,615
Kelly, come on, trust us.  
It's never cheating if it's with another chick!

367
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,800
Come on. -Try.

368
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,760
Come on, it's fun

369
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Have fun, do it! Everybody's doing it

370
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,250
You're not trying to take away her fun are you?

371
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:21,407
She's er... she's not my girlfriend.

372
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:25,017
Fine! I'll do it.

373
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
First you lick the salt - Here we go

374
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,083
Come over here

375
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:34,234
Then you suck up the tequila.

376
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
You don't have to do it.  
- I don't think we need any of your babysitting here Jake.

377
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
OK.

378
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:22,393
And to try with Jake and Kelly?

379
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:24,314
What? - What?

380
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,720
I think not.

381
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:27,271
Come on guys, are we shooting porn today or not?  
Lets make a decision

382
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,103
Thanks Crystal. Come Kelly.

383
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,363
Yes, and salt.

384
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:46,511
A little bit tequila.

385
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
Let's go.

386
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Mr. Goodman?

387
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,062
Coming.

388
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,789
I'm coming, hold your horses

389
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:35,823
The store is closed

390
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,114
I want to know what the hell this thing is doing in my lake?

391
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,762
Where did you get this?

392
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,452
In the middle of the lake.

393
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:54,102
Where there are 2 people dead!

394
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,318
- Oh my!God!  "Oh my" yeah that's right

395
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:06,661
Excuse me, but is that a fucking Piranha?

396
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:10,502
And it's not the only one. 
- There are thousands of them.

397
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,768
Thousands! And they're pissed!

398
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,533
I heard about these things happening.

399
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,913
It's like those baby alligators in New Jersey, 
someone leaves them ...

400
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,373
... and then they bread. - What?

401
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:22,944
Who released these fish into the lake?

402
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:24,518
What are you talking about?

403
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:27,937
This particular of piranha

404
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,356
vanished from the face of the earth

405
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,853
more than two million years ago!

406
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,345
Where's he going?

407
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:45,180
Allow me... to introduce...

408
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,973
The Pygocentrus. The original piranha

409
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:58,353
They used to swim the Colorado River

410
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:02,078
Right up until the Ice Age.

411
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,381
I still don't understand how you found one... alive?

412
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,791
We discovered a subterannean lake, through a rift created by the quake

413
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,940
How could it have survived so long, cut off from the surface?

414
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:20,205
Cannibalism.

415
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,237
They must have fought each other to survive.

416
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:25,928
Look.

417
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,192
Scars.

418
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,180
Notice the eyes.

419
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:35,954
Jesus. It's like they're staring back at you

420
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:41,096
No, no, no. Not staring. Sensing.

421
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,046
God! Don't do that.

422
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:53,002
Piranhas hunt in packs.

423
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:57,036
Not for protection, but for overwhelming force.

424
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,145
They're organised, methodical

425
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:06,521
The first bite draws the blood, the blood draws the pack

426
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,787
So how are we going to stop them?

427
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:12,089
I'm sorry, you're not actually thinking about going back out onto the lake?

428
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:16,852
They are killing machines but they are still fish.  
You can catch them or kill them.

429
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:20,731
But if there really are thousands ...  -Yes?

430
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,684
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

431
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,350
Shit.

432
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:38,384
My little brother and sister.

433
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:40,457
Are they waving for help?

434
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:45,028
I don't know. They should be home. 
I should be home.

435
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,600
Jake, what are you doing? You're gonna miss my money shot

436
00:44:48,024 --> 00:44:49,713
It's my familly alright! They could be in trouble

437
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:54,668
You'd be the one in trouble if you don't get my flying cacas right now!

438
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,741
What the hell is wrong with you man?

439
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:02,540
What's wrong with me?

440
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,148
Oh Godamit, your missing it, your missing it, your missing it.

441
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,254
Oh you missed it! What is wrong with you?

442
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:16,096
Listen, they're stranded out there.

443
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:17,480
They might need my help

444
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,433
Listen to me. My mum is sheriff.

445
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,788
OK. Let's swing by the island. 
Throw the minnows in the boat.

446
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:44,478
It'll be great.It'll be fun.

447
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:10,900
Get me up!

448
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:24,956
Get me up!

449
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,723
What's going on?

450
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Alright Lake Victoria, are you ready for some titties?!

451
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,740
Look at those weapons of masturbation!

452
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,100
Change!

453
00:47:37,503 --> 00:47:38,846
Yes, we need the National Guard ...

454
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:42,379
...We need the Coast Guard!  
I need all the forces you have the power to deploy!

455
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,620
Everybody back to the beach!

456
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,380
Everybody back!

457
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,958
<i>Read the Bible.

458
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:11,337
Don't talk about faith. Take the boat. 
No more talk about faith

459
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,091
What the fuck?

460
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:32,035
This is the Lake Victoria Sherrifs Department,

461
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:35,761
The Sherrif has declared an emergency.

462
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,980
Don't worry, we've got beer over here!

463
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,180
Cannonball!

464
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,060
I need you out of the water, now!

465
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,220
Jake? Why is he here?

466
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,980
I don't know.

467
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:28,566
We are so busted. - No, he is.

468
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,940
I didn't even catch a fish!

469
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,332
Slow down.

470
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,581
OK, Jake,I'm not taking the fall for this. 
It was all Zanes idea

471
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:48,499
I paid you $60 to stay home. What do you mean.

472
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:49,996
I'll give you 40 and we are even.

473
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:52,992
How about you get on a boat, go home and end of story.

474
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,254
Just get on the boat.

475
00:49:57,793 --> 00:50:01,402
We should've been on the beach an hour ago for the muthafucking main event.

476
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,340
Come on! - Go ahead.

477
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:07,584
Be careful pulling away from here.  
The rocks can strip away the engine

478
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,187
Come on,get some rest here. 

479
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:20,104
Take Zane and Laura with you, 
I don't want them anywhere near them.

480
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,754
The water is so clear.

481
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:29,245
What kind of fish was that?

482
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:30,474
I don't know.

483
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,625
I'm gonna make them take us home right now, ok?

484
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,619
What is that?

485
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,740
What happened?

486
00:50:39,426 --> 00:50:40,155
Are you guys okay?

487
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,343
I think we hit something.

488
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,300
Andrew! Andrew, what the hell is going on now?

489
00:50:54,248 --> 00:50:56,014
I don't know. We're stuck on something.

490
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:58,087
Well, fix it Godamit

491
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,159
There are rocks everywhere.  
- Yeah, they're right down here.

492
00:51:01,813 --> 00:51:02,811
What happened?

493
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,808
I think there's something caught on the prop

494
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:07,419
Stay put.

495
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:09,263
Crystal, get the sand rat up here

496
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:14,793
I said get the fucking sand rat up here! 
What's wrong with you?

497
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:17,213
Why can't you go get him yourself?

498
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:30,154
I'm just down here thinking how this whole fucked up day has been your fault.

499
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:32,689
You wont help us with the new bitch, 

500
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:37,337
you don't do a fucking thing I tell you and you take us way the fuck of course!

501
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:44,171
I get it, you're new at this. I'm cool with that man...

502
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,240
but what you're doing ...

503
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:48,624
what this is ...

504
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,680
there's a word for it ...

505
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,541
It's a boat word, er what is it?

506
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,997
Mutiny! Is that what this is? 

507
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,033
Is it a mutiny?

508
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,682
Relax Derek, ok? It's just getting a little wild

509
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:13,705
If anyone should be down there helping, it oughta be you!

510
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,776
Let me do that. Let me do it!

511
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:19,926
Let me do it!

512
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,560
This is an emergency. I need everyone out of the water now!

513
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,200
Get out of water now! This is an emergency!

514
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,058
Get out of the water now!

515
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:27,555
Oh,shit!

516
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,560
Come on! Come on!

517
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,520
Oh my God!

518
00:55:27,878 --> 00:55:29,836
Oh my God!

519
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:49,883
What are you doing?

520
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:53,070
Where are you going?

521
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:55,643
Throw me a gun! - It's fully loaded

522
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:12,004
Don't let go.

523
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,040
Swim to the beach! Get out of water!

524
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,449
Get out of water!

525
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,440
Come on!

526
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,520
Todd, what are you doing?

527
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,240
Get the fuck out of the way!

528
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:03,645
Get the fuck out of the way!

529
00:58:58,525 --> 00:58:59,753
You're gonna kill the engine.

530
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:10,392
Zane, Laura, hold on to something and get back from the glass.

531
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:14,919
Come on!

532
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,341
Come on!

533
00:59:17,032 --> 00:59:17,606
Yes, yes!

534
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:07,666
Holy shit!

535
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,880
Let's go!

536
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:32,848
Are you okay?

537
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,160
Are you okay? - Yes.

538
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,918
Where is Kelly?  - It is on the other side.

539
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,400
There.

540
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,880
Kelly! Kelly!

541
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,365
Jake!

542
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:48,589
Get out of the water!

543
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,760
I cant find a way to you.  Get out through the skylite

544
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:54,270
Hurry up!

545
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,342
Jake!

546
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,806
Let's go. I don't want you to see this.

547
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,640
They took my penis! They took my penis.

548
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,158
They took my penis.

549
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,640
Jake hurry up, the water's getting higher

550
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,160
Jake!

551
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,120
Kelly!

552
01:02:10,972 --> 01:02:11,892
Hurry up!

553
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:14,311
Can you reach the skylite?

554
01:04:07,252 --> 01:04:09,247
Chew on this muthafuckers!

555
01:04:13,624 --> 01:04:14,659
Everybody out!

556
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,040
All ashore!

557
01:04:37,924 --> 01:04:39,228
Everybody out!

558
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,040
No! No!

559
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:24,911
Hold this.

560
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,060
[phone ringing]

561
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,132
This is Sheriff Forester.

562
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,243
Mum? - Jake.

563
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:33,815
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

564
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,800
What?

565
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:36,888
Where are Laura and Zane?

566
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,040
They're with me on the boat.

567
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,480
Oh my God, Jake.

568
01:05:40,382 --> 01:05:42,223
Whatever you do, do not go into the water!

569
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:45,180
You don't understand, Mum. Our boat is sinking.

570
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:51,283
Where are you?

571
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,472
What are you doing?

572
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:09,903
I'm coming with you.

573
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:11,092
Let's go.

574
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,011
That's mum.

575
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,400
Mum! Hey!

576
01:06:38,926 --> 01:06:40,575
Jack,rocks.

577
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:43,033
How are we gonna get the boat close? - I don't know.

578
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:48,023
The rope. Do you think it will reach?

579
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,516
Jake, I'm gonna throw you the rope.  
I want you to tie it to the highest railing

580
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,480
Okay, Mum.

581
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,480
Tied? - Yes.

582
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,560
Back up a bit.

583
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:04,222
Watch out for rocks.

584
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,520
Watch out!

585
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:08,868
Ready? - Yeah.

586
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:13,934
That's good.Stay at what you are far.

587
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,920
Yeah.

588
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:32,054
Keep it tight. I've got my radio

589
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:34,857
Hold on.

590
01:07:50,828 --> 01:07:51,863
Mum, are you okay?

591
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:58,274
Is this everybody on the boat?

592
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:01,767
No, Kelly is stuck down in the cabin. 
We can't get her out.

593
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,341
We can't get her out. - Kelly?

594
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,560
God! Kelly?

595
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:11,058
Can you reach my arm?

596
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,560
Help me get out of here. Water is getting higher!

597
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:16,661
- Can you reach the skylite? 
It doesn't matter. It's fucking stuck!

598
01:08:21,846 --> 01:08:23,073
Jake!

599
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm scared!

600
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,146
Please help!

601
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,560
Mum, hurry! - Kelly?

602
01:08:31,136 --> 01:08:33,093
- Were gonna die. We are not gonna die, OK?

603
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,000
I need your help! Please!

604
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:47,027
The only way to reach it under the ship.

605
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,920
Get the rope.

606
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,944
What are you talking about? We can't leave her down there.

607
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:54,474
Once I get everyone cross the rope, I'm goona come back for her.

608
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:56,702
No,I'm not leaving without her mum!

609
01:08:56,857 --> 01:09:00,003
Jesus, Jake! The only way to get to her is for you to get into the water

610
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,460
I'm not gonna let you do that!

611
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:05,032
The reason she came on this boat was coz of me

612
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:06,837
That's my fault.

613
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:11,712
I'm not going without her.

614
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:14,208
- This isn't gonna hold much longer. Let's go!

615
01:09:16,204 --> 01:09:18,276
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and when I come back,

616
01:09:19,506 --> 01:09:20,848
we are gonna do it together.

617
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,920
Alright.

618
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:25,992
We're gonna keep the 2 little ones between us, you go first.

619
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:31,021
Can you do this?  
- You better believe it! I don't pole dance for nothing!

620
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:36,779
You have a lot of explaining to do.

621
01:09:39,353 --> 01:09:40,849
Ready?

622
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:49,755
Be careful, don't look down. Let's go.

623
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,560
Just like at the playground guys,

624
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,520
... hand over hand

625
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:05,033
Don't look down.

626
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,040
Don't look down, alright.

627
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,680
Come on, you can do this.

628
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,160
Don't look down.

629
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,720
GET OFF ME!

630
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,360
No! No!

631
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,080
Godammit!

632
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,217
Laura, listen to me!

633
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:15,285
If you move fast, it will not get you.

634
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,280
You have to move now!

635
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:16,667
Come on!

636
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,162
Do it!

637
01:11:29,068 --> 01:11:30,026
OK guys, you're here.

638
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:35,440
You did it.

639
01:11:41,314 --> 01:11:42,503
Damn it!

640
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,400
Let's go, keep moving!

641
01:11:53,983 --> 01:11:54,711
Are you ok?

642
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:56,092
Cut the engine.

643
01:11:57,744 --> 01:11:58,510
What are you doing?

644
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:01,352
Jake, what are you doing?

645
01:12:04,078 --> 01:12:05,190
What are you doing?

646
01:12:05,692 --> 01:12:06,458
Jake!

647
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:07,992
Jake, do not!

648
01:12:08,186 --> 01:12:09,720
They want blood, don't they?

649
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,256
Well, we'll give them.

650
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:26,649
Wet T-shirt, wet t-shirt.

651
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:45,309
Jake!

652
01:13:46,653 --> 01:13:47,880
Oh my God! Oh my God!

653
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:52,180
We're gonna get out of here. Both of us!

654
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:58,323
- I'm in! I you need to pull us out as fast as possible! Do you copy?

655
01:13:58,515 --> 01:13:59,972
- Ok, we're ready when you are.

656
01:14:06,231 --> 01:14:07,996
Jake, what are you doing? They're gonna come back.

657
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,875
I gave them a snack. That's gonna hold them off for a while at least

658
01:14:17,212 --> 01:14:19,668
I need you to tie these together ok? - Why?

659
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,920
Just do it!

660
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:22,123
Where are you going?

661
01:14:23,353 --> 01:14:25,233
Jake!

662
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:44,005
Can you hold it tight?

663
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:50,071
Hold your breath, we'll swim to the bottom of the boat.

664
01:14:50,878 --> 01:14:53,142
I need you to hold on tight. Can you hold on tight to me?

665
01:14:56,637 --> 01:15:03,853
I need you to pull us out in 10 seconds, do you copy?  
- Copy that. 10 seconds on your signal.

666
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:05,426
Get the kids down.

667
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:17,404
10. .. 10

668
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:35,752
6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ...

669
01:15:36,638 --> 01:15:39,745
... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 .

670
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,000
Come on!

671
01:15:59,632 --> 01:16:00,475
Come on, fucking thing!

672
01:16:16,753 --> 01:16:17,481
Come on!

673
01:16:39,364 --> 01:16:40,476
Oh my God!

674
01:16:41,783 --> 01:16:42,434
Holy shit!

675
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:02,166
Are you okay?

676
01:17:04,893 --> 01:17:06,811
Kick your legs, come on!

677
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:10,112
Let's go!

678
01:17:12,916 --> 01:17:14,949
You're alright.

679
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:17,330
Breathe, you're ok.

680
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:20,822
You're ok.

681
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:23,280
Oh my God! It's good to have you on board!

682
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:27,003
Shit.

683
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:32,608
Look mum, over there.

684
01:17:34,337 --> 01:17:35,372
They died.

685
01:17:36,756 --> 01:17:37,714
They're all dead.

686
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,640
You did it Jake!

687
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:55,335
Hey, it worked.

688
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:58,329
I thought dynamite fishing is illegal in these parts sheriff?

689
01:17:59,521 --> 01:18:01,823
[over radio] -Sheriff! Sherrif?

690
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:03,895
Yes, this Julie.

691
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:09,077
Julie, we have a major problem.

692
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:14,375
I'm looking out at a school of dead piranha.  
It's not all of them, but it's a good start.

693
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:15,719
You don't understand.

694
01:18:16,796 --> 01:18:18,445
The specimen you left with me 

695
01:18:19,253 --> 01:18:23,590
has no mature reproductive organs.

696
01:18:24,396 --> 01:18:26,122
- What? What are you talking about?

697
01:18:28,081 --> 01:18:32,111
The piranhas that killed those divers, 
the ones you're hunting for...

698
01:18:33,187 --> 01:18:35,067
They're not fully developed!

699
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:37,447
They're the babies!

700
01:18:40,444 --> 01:18:41,441
Babies?

701
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:47,046
Well, where are the parents?

702
01:18:47,046 --> 02:00:20,581
