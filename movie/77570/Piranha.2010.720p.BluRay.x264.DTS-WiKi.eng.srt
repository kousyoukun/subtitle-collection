1
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:31,836
# I can always hear and sing that song #

2
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:35,400
# kill me and i'm on my way home#

3
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:54,415
Catch you.

4
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:57,858
Come on! Come on!

5
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,420
Look at that

6
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Son of a bitch

7
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,537
Help!

8
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,975
Help!

9
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:05,374


10
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:11,893


11
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,531


12
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,333


13
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:22,124


14
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,336


15
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:37,595
Obvious,it was a mistake.    Can't we just work something out here?

16
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:40,236
Mistake or no mistake,   you just destroyed private property.

17
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:42,998
And from the smell of your breath,   I suggest you take the ticket.

18
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,681
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

19
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,883
I don't know,  I thought you'd drive me home.

20
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,565
Touching an officers  uniform is considered an assault?

21
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:52,089
Were you aware of that?

22
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,812
Come on.You look pretty hot in tan.

23
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,626
It's not tan, it's beige!

24
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:01,900
Hey, take it easy!

25
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:05,625
Another step and you'll  pissing lightning bolts into next week, ok?

26
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:26,006
Pretty much your average day in college

27
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,209
Hey Kelly, I wasn't  sure you'd be coming back.

28
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,332
for spring break

29
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:31,934
Yeah, I'm here

30
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:36,578
I can only assume you're down here to get on one of those boats

31
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:40,464
No, I came down here to pick up my little sister for music lessons.

32
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:41,785
How about yourself?

33
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:46,311
I'm just waiting for my ride.    Todd and his friends, we're gonna go check out some music.

34
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,272
Todd Dupree?

35
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,594
Remind me who you're going out with again?

36
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,438
You gotta have standards ok, thats all I'm saying

37
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,641
Todd's a really good DJ.

38
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,128
Kelly! Let's go. Jump in we're late.

39
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,692
Listen,he says he's got  backstage passes for  Planners.

40
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:08,935
you should come

41
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,577
I would, but I'm pretty much under house arrest   with Shing Tsing and Laura.

42
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,900
Too bad

43
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:16,543
We'll miss you.

44
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,266
Anyways,I gotta go. - Come on, let's go!

45
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:22,470
I hope to see you again before you...

46
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:25,833
... before you leave.Pretty smooth,Jake.

47
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,919
Hey asswipe! Cool shirt!

48
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,533
Nice horn. Thanks

49
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:45,496
Nice boobs

50
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:47,778
Thanks

51
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,990
I have a training bra  but I don't like to wear it, it itches.

52
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,663
Tell me about it.

53
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,588
Who are you waiting for?

54
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,589
My brother Jake. He's 17.

55
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,153
And he'll like your boobs too. - They all do.

56
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:02,755
Come on, let's go.

57
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,117
What happened to you?

58
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,318
I don't want to talk  about it, ok. Let's go.

59
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,600
Hi Jake.

60
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:09,923
Try to not stare at her boobs.

61
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,325
Shut up.

62
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:13,927
I like your shirt.

63
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:15,809
Why? You wanna throw something at me too?

64
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,573
No, actually I like The Pixies.

65
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,614
Danni, Danni, Danni, where  the hell is Crystal?

66
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,016
She's over there with Andrew.

67
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:24,498
She went to get some sunscreen.

68
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,541
Sunscreen?

69
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:27,502
Andrew, Crystal, we don't  need sunscreen.

70
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,223
We need body paint, condoms.  We need Ready Whip

71
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:36,191
Tell her to come tomorrow  I want bleach blonde booty at the marina.    I gotta get  my first shot off by noon.

72
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,114
Make sure those titties are nice and perky!

73
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:41,358
Who's this?

74
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,079
This is Jake. He's a local.

75
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,166
Sandrat huh? You know your way around the lake?   -Yes.

76
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,807
You wanna job? I'll pay you cash money.

77
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,649
Don't bullshit Jake.

78
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:55,053
My guide didn't show and I need somebody asap.

79
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:59,137
I need someone with ambition,    someone who is willing to take chances ...

80
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,260
... If, you, know, what, I, mean.

81
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,102
Mr, you talk funny.

82
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,231
Yeah, well, you're short! 

83
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,316
Hold on, - This is Derick

84
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,952
Don't you disappoint  me motherfucker. I told you!

85
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:16,356
I want the biggest Goddam  boat this podunk town has to offer

86
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:17,839
Who is that?

87
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,441
Derick? He's the director.

88
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:24,125
So you're like a, er.. actress or what?

89
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,407
I am a 'Wild Wild Girl'.

90
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,491
What's a 'Wild Wild Girl', Jake?

91
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:35,617
Of course we know boats!  Fuck the waiver!   You signed the waiver!

92
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,179
So, Jake baby, are we gonna do this?

93
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,903
Do what?   - The job! Location scout!  Get us around, show us the spots...

94
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:44,107
the G-spots. I need a local.

95
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:45,790
I need you.

96
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:49,074
We're talking about life lesson here Jake.

97
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:53,118
Great, 10am, tomorrow. Don't be late.

98
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
And... wear a different shirt

99
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:58,043
Guess we'll see you tomorrow Jake.

100
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:00,246
Actually, tomorrow he's...

101
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,885
-Jake Why'd you bother to knock,    if you're just gonna walk straight in?

102
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,609
Am I disturbing you?

103
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,214
No, I'm just doing homework, and research for school.

104
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,221
Laura has been telling me that you may have some other plans for tomorrow

105
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:54,224
No,what she's talking  about. I'm 100% baby-sitting.

106
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,707
What? No, we don't want babysitter.

107
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,071
Yeah mum. Especially not Jake.

108
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,874
I'm serious, mum, we dont need one.

109
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:04,797
Out, out, out.

110
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:10,803
Jake, you know I don't have a backup.

111
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,769
I know mum. Don't worry, you know how crazy this week is for you.

112
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,653
And dont worry, I'll take care of the nitwits, ok?

113
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:23,137
Remember, if you do not fulfill their responsibilities,    I have power to arrest

114
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,179
and imprison you.

115
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:28,663
Mum, I'm not 12. playing on the sheriff card doesn't work.

116
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:31,306
No? - No!

117
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,429
Like I said, I'll take care of them, ok?

118
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,232
Alright.

119
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,956
Now get outta here     -I promise next year I'll try to find another solution.

120
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,388
Alright? - Alright.

121
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,691
Oh and Jake. -Come on Mum! Really?

122
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,934
It's time for dinner.

123
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:57,935
OK, alright, I'll be right there.

124
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,008
Hope I didn't wake the kids?

125
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,050
They'll sleep through anything.

126
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:32,373
So, Maggy said yesterday was the last time she saw him?

127
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,017
Yeah, just before noon.

128
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,579
She said Matt took a boat to catch some bass.

129
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,181
She drove around the lake all night looking for him.

130
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,185
Where's the boat? - Over there.

131
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,959
Feeling like a skinny dip?

132
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,523
Yeah, if we can make it to the end of the pier

133
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,287
You mean I'm to old, or too heavy?

134
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,169
I think you're too chicken-shit!

135
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:08,735
By the way, Gordon called last night.

136
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:09,937
Yeah?

137
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:14,141
He said that U.S.G.S. recorded heavy seismic activity below the lake.

138
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:15,462
Really?

139
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:18,265
Yeah, they're sending in a team of seismologist divers

140
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:22,710
And he told them that you're gonna escort them out!

141
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,352
Jesus Christ.

142
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,675
We've just been invaded by 20,000 kids

143
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:28,757
makes us a little busy at the moment.

144
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,119
I know. That's what I told him

145
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,269
[creaking]

146
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,915
This doesnt sound too good

147
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,864
So, what time are the divers gonna get here?

148
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,587
He said around 10.

149
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:13,727
Shit.

150
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,535
Come on, just a little more.

151
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:23,538
I can't get it

152
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,074
- Jules!

153
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,230
Give me your hand!

154
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,441
Do you think a propeller could've done this?

155
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:46,604
I doubt it. Look at the bones. Nothing broken

156
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,809
It looks like toxic, are acidic decomposition

157
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,170
it's as it this body has been in the water for weeks

158
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:58,136
What would you say if I told that I'm thinking about closing the lake?

159
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:03,302
...at least until we get an autopsy report     - An autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days

160
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,826
It'd be easier to drain this lake, than close it.

161
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:09,308
I's a big financial week for our town.

162
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,326
I'm gettin too old for this

163
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:24,472
We're not liying to mum.  - Yeah, we won't lie to mum.

164
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:28,197
Come on guys, every year it's the same.     I'm stuck here with you

165
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,758
and miss all the spring break fun.

166
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,480
You mean spring break boobies!

167
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:34,123
What if I give you guys the cash for the baby-sitting?

168
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:35,564
Sixty bucks and you gotta deal.

169
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:37,327
Sixty? But I'm only getting paid forty.

170
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,689
Twenty dollar deception surcharge!

171
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:48,339
Don't pick up the phone, don't answer the door

172
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,181
and don't leave the house.

173
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:52,864
OK? I'm counting on you guys.

174
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,265
Alright?

175
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,089
Town rules son.    You throw a peice of trash in the lake, you gotta pick up 10 peices

176
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:31,067
After the dive, our presence is requested at 'Cocomos'    The Arizona State cheerleading team.

177
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:32,828
Hi, I'm Sheriff Forester.

178
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:35,030
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

179
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,514
It's nice to have a welcoming committee around here

180
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,516
I assume that's technical equipment too?

181
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:41,278
Yeah, Sam, give those back.

182
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,842
According to the epicenter coordinates

183
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:47,725
we need to go here.

184
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,808
Ok, that's about 20 minutes out

185
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:53,772
Ready when you are. -Alright

186
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,099
You dont see many women working Law Enforcement out here in cowboy country.

187
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,892
You dont see a lot of cowboys though

188
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,532
Kelly.

189
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:41,658
Jake.

190
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:46,217
Who exactly are you baby-sitting here?

191
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,020
This is a funny story actually.

192
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:53,184


193
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:57,790
Wow. Look at those idiots.

194
00:20:58,231 --> 00:20:59,271
Yeah, it's terrible.

195
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,115
Sandrat! Hey Sandrat, I'm talking to you.

196
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,319
Where the hell have you been?    We've got the girls lubed up

197
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,802
We're ready to roll.   I'm docking your paycheck!

198
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,284
Let's go.

199
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,251
Now I see what you've been scouting last 15 minutes.

200
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:21,455
Kelly, it was great to see you, I know you gotta get going...

201
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,378
Hi Kelly, I'm Derick Jones.

202
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,900
Hi

203
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:26,822
You know this guy?

204
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,905
 Jake? Jake is my boy!

205
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:33,229
He's the man with the plan! The insight, the knowledge!

206
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,195
Great. Those girls, they aren't with you are they?

207
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:40,316
Yes, why? Are you into girls?

208
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:44,122
No, I'm just showing him around town.    All the hotspots, stuff like that.

209
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:49,207
The job is called location scout,   and Kelly you should come with us.

210
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,770
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

211
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,971
No, she's got other plans already.

212
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,335
Kelly do you like champagne?

213
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:04,984
I love champagne, actually I love ...

214
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,547
I would love to come on your boat Derek, thanks.

215
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,675
Come on, let me... let me help you aboard.

216
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:25,847
Hey Kelly baby.   What happened to hanging with us today?

217
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:28,529
Is he your boyfriend or something?     - No, he's just a boy from school...

218
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:31,814
...who said he has back-stage passes, when actually, he doesn't!

219
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,737
- Have a good day! - Come on Kelly!

220
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,258
Take these T-shirts.

221
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:40,184
What the fuck.

222
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:41,862
That was Derick Jones!

223
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,405
Is that Jake Forester?

224
00:22:56,082 --> 00:23:03,009
See you at 4 in wet t-shirt contest.

225
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,892
Dave, we have to talk about this

226
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,534
We told Jake that we'd stay at the house.

227
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:10,055
I told him that I would fish.

228
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:12,139
I can't if there are no fish.

229
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,820
The lake's too busy.

230
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,262
Come on. Sand Island is really close

231
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,599
I should've brought my trombone.

232
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:33,438
No way! "Be a girl and sunbathe or something!

233
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:38,568
When I become a rock star, just see if I let YOU be in my group!

234
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,051
Give me a break,dude!

235
00:23:41,372 --> 00:23:43,693
You play the trombone!

236
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:03,318
Here we go ladies... a little Champagne...     - Thanks ... the finest your gas station has to offer

237
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,324
Cheers!

238
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,767
to our newest 'Wild Wild Girl'

239
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:19,973
That's why we came here. Derick wants to capture innocence.

240
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:22,016
It's all about innocence

241
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,130
Just like her.

242
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,474
Don't worry. Derick's just making his play.     You might as well ask him not to breathe

243
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:37,753
It's the rules. Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

244
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,854
It's like a law of physics.

245
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,718
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

246
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,842
She's not messing up your party is she?

247
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,925
What do I care. She's not my girlfriend.

248
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:51,249
This is great. I'm having a great time.

249
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,732
We're going wild, I'm going wild.

250
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:57,775
Hey, Jake. How far is this place? Come on!

251
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:00,098
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there

252
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:03,781
So speaking of going wild...

253
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:07,106
you haven't seen anything yet!

254
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:47,031
Why not join us?

255
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,284
Hey, what's up guys?     - Close that door, you're ruining our shot!

256
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:00,793
Come on Sandrat. Get with the program.

257
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,624
Here they come, here they come. Here come my nymphs.

258
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,040
Oh my God!

259
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:13,125
Check it out! The fish, with boobies

260
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,091
If all fish look like that, I would fuck fish!

261
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:22,617
Looking good ladies. You like this, right Jake?

262
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:25,380
You should be paying us today, not the other way around!

263
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:35,070
Look at these goddess aquatic bitches. This is hot Andy!

264
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:36,913
This is so hot. This is what it's all about

265
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:41,318
Beer, sun and naked hunnies making out under water!

266
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:57,057
Mum, what's going on there?

267
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,862
How come you didn't pick up the home phone?

268
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,582
I've been trying to reach you.

269
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:10,230
I was outside. I can go and get it if you need me to.

270
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,108
No, that's okay.

271
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:17,078
Oh my God!

272
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,399
What?

273
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,806
Nothing, just kids.

274
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:27,890
They're outside fishing...

275
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,252
... and it's really nice to see them ...

276
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:32,494
... playing with each other.

277
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:36,301
Put your ass on the glass!

278
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,062
Jake is someone there with you?

279
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,506
No, no, no. 

280
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:46,110
Just the kids on the lake. It's crazy here. You know how it is.

281
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,875
Honey, I don't want Zane or Laura near the lake today, you hear me?

282
00:28:50,955 --> 00:28:55,040
Alright, we will stay in and we'll watch TV.

283
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:58,803
Alright, I gotta go. Thank you so much for this

284
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,687
I'll try to come home early, ok?

285
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,810
Alright, alright. I love you. I gotta go.

286
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:08,415
Kelly?

287
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,142
Kelly, where are you?

288
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:27,636
Kelly?

289
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:15,768
Jake, you missed the rest of the show.

290
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,454
Let's go. Towels for the girls.

291
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,260
Wow! Great! good work. Way to tie up a canoe

292
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:27,580
I must've gotten my knots mixed up.

293
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,427
So you catch zero fish, and lose us our only boat.    Today is just full of accomplishments

294
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,584
Jake's gonna kill us.

295
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:38,555
Somebody will see us. See, there are some boats over there.

296
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:42,921
Don't waste your time. They'll never see us, it's way too far.

297
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:46,884
Hello!  Hello!

298
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,172
Hello!  Hello!

299
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,552
We need help!

300
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,315
We're over here!

301
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:18,358
Help us, somebody.

302
00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:24,365
We're over here, help!

303
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:24,352
Woah! Look at the size of that!

304
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:26,635
What is it? A cavern system?

305
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,279
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

306
00:32:32,963 --> 00:32:34,363
You see this gap here? -Yes.

307
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:37,327
The quake opened that up, now it's a connecting passage.

308
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,210
A lake under a lake?

309
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,532
That's right. Sorry but it's still your jurisdiction.

310
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,614
This is part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

311
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:46,496
That's the beauty of it.

312
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:48,619
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

313
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,303
I don't know why you get s o excited by that crap.

314
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:55,547
All we ever see is rocks and sand.

315
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:18,492
I should warn them, it's not very pretty down there.

316
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:21,215
Tourists treat this lake like it's a garbage can.

317
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:24,019
How's it going down there?

318
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:26,902
Sheriff said that it's a real treasure trove down there

319
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:32,549
so I've got dibs on the old body spray, and 'Jugs' magazines

320
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,071
I got dibs on home appliances.

321
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,555
I got dibs on missing college girls

322
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,481
Oh my God!

323
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,165
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

324
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,047
Could you keep your mind on the task.

325
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,138
At least 200 feet Novak

326
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:06,825
Almost full visibility.

327
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:15,876
You should see this. It's unbelieveable!

328
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,362
Novak, you copy? - Yes, pretty good

329
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,094
Ok,guy.You're about 90 feet to the entrance of the connecting passage

330
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,219
It looks like single file time

331
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:37,657
I'll go first

332
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,038
No, I should do the preliminary scout.

333
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,745
No offense, you'll get us stuck!

334
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:43,747
Baybe, I'm like an eel.

335
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,911
Electrical eel can get into small spaces that it is shocking.

336
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:50,235
That's weird

337
00:34:51,077 --> 00:34:53,119
Here they are and they're splitting up

338
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,726
Guys,is everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

339
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,906
I'm getting a serious drop in temperature

340
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:18,660
it's at least 30 degrees colder.

341
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:22,110
You're probably at the mouth of the underwater lake

342
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:25,674
Do you have any visual?

343
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:30,119
I'm entering the cave

344
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,237
Jesus!

345
00:35:54,227 --> 00:35:56,228
It seems endless.

346
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:11,379
You gotta see this.

347
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:13,446
This is incredible

348
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:16,038
What do you see down there?

349
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,640
Something just bit me!

350
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,785
Yes, okay, I thought you like that kinda stuff?

351
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,983
Sam! Sam! Answer me!

352
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,776
Something's happening.  - What?  I don't know. Give me my flippers.

353
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,084
Get him out of the water!

354
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,538
Oh my God!

355
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:19,895
Your body is a temple, and now it is time to thank the Gods.

356
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:23,819
Andrew, camera.

357
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,901
Come on you. No, no, no.

358
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:29,305
No, thanks. I think I've already had too much.

359
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,995
Come on, don't you want to worship at a beautiful altar.

360
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:35,752
I know you prefer champagne, but you believe us, you can trust Crystal.

361
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,034
Come on Derick, she said no.

362
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:43,760
No, she said 'no thanks', there's a difference.     She understands that gratitude is the right attitude.

363
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:49,488
Kelly, come on, trust us.     It's never cheating if it's with another chick!

364
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:49,681
Come on. -Try.

365
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:50,682
Come on, it's fun

366
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,539
Have fun, do it! Everybody's doing it

367
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:56,406
You're not trying to take away her fun are you?

368
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:59,698
Like I said,she's er... she's not my girlfriend.

369
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,462
Fine! I'll do it.

370
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,366
First you lick the salt - Here we go

371
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,830
Come over here

372
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,073
Then you suck up the tequila.

373
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:23,173
You don't have to do it.     - I don't think we need any of your babysitting here Jake.

374
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:56,873
Alright.

375
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:03,289
How about try with Jake and Kelly?

376
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:04,249
What? - What?

377
00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:05,715
No,I don't think she... -I'm ok

378
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,375
Come on guys, are we shooting porn today or not?     Lets make a decision

379
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:17,584
Thanks Crystal. Come Kelly.

380
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:24,112
Yes, and salt.

381
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,437
A little bit tequila.

382
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,327
Let's go.

383
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,779
Mr. Goodman?

384
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:13,848
Coming.

385
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,691
I'm coming, hold your horses

386
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:19,855
The store is closed

387
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:31,628
I want to know what the hell this thing is doing in my lake?

388
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,432
Where did you get this?

389
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,194
In the middle of the lake.

390
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:38,915
Where there are 2 people dead!

391
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,524
- Oh my!God!  "Oh my" yeah that's right

392
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:52,010
Excuse me, but is that a fucking Piranha?

393
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:56,015
And it's not the only one.    - There are thousands of them.

394
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:58,378
Thousands! And they're pissed!

395
00:42:58,698 --> 00:43:00,218
I heard about these things happening.

396
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,743
It's like those baby alligators in New Jersey,    someone leaves them ...

397
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:05,265
... and then they bread. - What?

398
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:08,988
Who released these fish into the lake?

399
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:10,630
What are you talking about?

400
00:43:11,313 --> 00:43:14,195
This particular of piranha

401
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:16,717
vanished from the face of the earth

402
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:19,321
more than two million years ago!

403
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,005
Where's he going?

404
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:32,174
Allow me... to introduce...

405
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:42,385
The Pygocentrus. The original piranha

406
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:45,910
They used to swim the Colorado River

407
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:49,794
Right up until the Ice Age.

408
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:54,281
I still don't understand how you found one... alive?

409
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:02,007
We discovered a subterrane lake, through a rift created by the quake

410
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,333
How could it have survived so long, cut off from the surface?

411
00:44:07,454 --> 00:44:08,695
Cannibalism.

412
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,899
They must have fought each other to survive.

413
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:14,662
Look.

414
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,066
Scars.

415
00:44:19,555 --> 00:44:21,182
Notice the eyes.

416
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:25,117
Jesus. It's like they're staring back at you

417
00:44:25,117 --> 00:44:30,478
No, no, no. Not staring. Sensing.

418
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:39,811
God! Don't do that.

419
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,893
Piranhas hunt in packs.

420
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:47,099
Not for protection, but for overwhelming force.

421
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:50,341
They're organised, methodical

422
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:56,989
The first bite draws the blood, the blood draws the pack

423
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:59,352
So how are we going to stop them?

424
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:02,795
I'm sorry, you're not actually thinking about going back out onto the lake?

425
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:07,761
They are killing machines but they are still fish.     You can catch them or kill them.

426
00:45:09,645 --> 00:45:11,806
But if there really are thousands ...    -Yes?

427
00:45:13,729 --> 00:45:16,971
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

428
00:46:28,212 --> 00:46:29,612
Shit.

429
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,776
My little brother and sister.

430
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:34,937
Are they waving for help?

431
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,703
I don't know. They should be home right now.    I should be home right now.

432
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,385
Jake, what are you doing? You're gonna miss my money shot

433
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:44,588
It's my familly alright! They could be in trouble

434
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:49,755
You'd be the one in trouble if you don't get my flying cacas right now!

435
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:51,917
What the hell is wrong with you man?

436
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:57,963
What's wrong with me?

437
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,768
Oh Godamit, your missing it, your missing it, your missing it.

438
00:47:06,894 --> 00:47:09,135
Oh you missed it! What is wrong with you?

439
00:47:09,457 --> 00:47:12,098
Listen, they're stranded out there.

440
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:13,541
They might need my help

441
00:47:15,664 --> 00:47:18,706
Listen to me. My mum is sheriff.

442
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:39,930
OK. Let's swing by the island.    Throw the minnows in the boat.

443
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:41,692
It'll be great.It'll be fun.

444
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:09,243
Get me up!

445
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:23,899
Get me up!

446
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,742
What's going on?

447
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,828
Alright Lake Victoria, are you ready for some titties?!

448
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:08,511
Look at those weapons of masturbation!

449
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:14,099
Change!

450
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:40,945
Yes, I need the National Guard ...

451
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,629
...I need the Coast Guard!     I need all the forces you have the power to deploy!

452
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:48,008
Everybody back to the beach!

453
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:51,929
Everybody back!

454
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:10,258
Read the Bible.

455
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,824
Don't talk about faith. Take the boat back.    No more talk about faith

456
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:23,952
What the fuck?

457
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:36,406
This is the Lake Victoria Sherrifs Department,

458
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:40,291
The Sherrif has declared an emergency.

459
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,605
Don't worry, we've got beer over here!

460
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,899
Cannonball!

461
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:51,030
I need you out of the water, now!

462
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:29,777
Is that Jake? Why is he here?

463
00:51:29,777 --> 00:51:30,569
I don't know.

464
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:34,308
We are so busted. - No, he is.

465
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:35,115
I didn't even catch a fish!

466
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:38,235
Slow down.

467
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:52,050
OK, Jake,I'm not taking the fall for this.    It was all Zanes idea

468
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:56,135
I paid you $60 to stay home. What do you mean.

469
00:51:56,496 --> 00:51:57,696
I'll give you 40 and we are even.

470
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:00,820
How about you get on a boat, go home and end of story.

471
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:05,264
Just get on the boat.

472
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:09,590
We should've been on the beach an hour ago   for the muthafucking main event.

473
00:52:08,649 --> 00:52:10,568
Come on! - Go ahead.

474
00:52:12,794 --> 00:52:16,036
Be careful getting out of here.     The rocks can strip away the engine

475
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:26,049
Come on,you can rest down here. 

476
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:29,090
Take Zane and Laura with you,    I don't want them anywhere near them.

477
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:31,853
The water is so clear.

478
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:38,622
What kind of fish was that?

479
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,903
I don't know.

480
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:42,146
I'm gonna make them take us home right now, ok?

481
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:45,268
What is that?

482
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:46,437
What happened?

483
00:52:49,237 --> 00:52:49,998
Are you guys okay?

484
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,279
I think we hit something.

485
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:02,661
Andrew! Andrew, what the hell is going on now?

486
00:53:04,693 --> 00:53:06,534
I don't know. We're stuck on something.

487
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:08,695
Well, fix it Godamit

488
00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:11,899
There are rocks everywhere.     - Yeah, they're right down here.

489
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:13,621
What happened?

490
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,704
I think there's something caught on the prop

491
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,426
Stay put.

492
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,349
Crystal, get the sand rat up here

493
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:26,115
I said get the fucking sand rat up here!    What's wrong with you?

494
00:53:27,197 --> 00:53:28,638
Why can't you go get him yourself?

495
00:53:38,088 --> 00:53:42,132
I'm just down here thinking how this   whole fucked up day has been your fault.

496
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:44,775
You wont help us with the new bitch, 

497
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:49,622
you don't do a fucking thing   I tell you and you take us way the fuck of course!

498
00:53:52,306 --> 00:53:56,748
I get it, you're new at this. I'm cool with that man...

499
00:53:56,861 --> 00:53:57,862
but what you're doing ...

500
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:01,391
what this is ...

501
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:03,535
there's a word for it ...

502
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,561
It's a boat word, er what is it?

503
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:11,164
Mutiny! Is that what this is? 

504
00:54:11,446 --> 00:54:13,287
Is it a mutiny?

505
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,092
Relax Derek, ok? It's just getting a little wild

506
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:27,543
If anyone should be down there helping, it oughta be you!

507
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,788
Let me do that. Let me do it!

508
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,030
Let me do it!

509
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,118
This is an emergency. I need everyone out of the water now!

510
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,871
Get out of water now! This is an emergency!

511
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:49,808
Get out of the water now!

512
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:44,547
Oh,shit!

513
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:30,432
Come on! Come on!

514
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:29,824
Oh my God!

515
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:52,051
Oh my God!

516
00:58:11,913 --> 00:58:12,954
What are you doing?

517
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:16,277
Where are you going?

518
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,960
Throw me a gun! - It's fully loaded

519
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:36,020
Don't let go.

520
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:42,313
Swim to the beach! Get out of water!

521
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,021
Get out of water!

522
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:39,037
Come on!

523
00:59:54,427 --> 00:59:56,846
Todd, what are you doing?

524
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:06,981
Get the fuck out of the way!

525
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:32,429
Get the fuck out of the way!

526
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:30,933
You're gonna kill the engine.

527
01:01:38,503 --> 01:01:42,027
Zane, Laura, hold on to something and get back from the glass.

528
01:01:45,988 --> 01:01:46,747
Come on!

529
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,230
Come on!

530
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,549
Yeah, yeah!

531
01:02:40,307 --> 01:02:41,747
Holy shit!

532
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:05,952
Let's go!

533
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:08,004
Are you guys okay?

534
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,372
Are you okay? - Yes.

535
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:11,750
Where is Kelly?    - She is on the other side.

536
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,751
Down there.

537
01:03:15,086 --> 01:03:16,379
Kelly! Kelly!

538
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:20,013
Jake!

539
01:03:22,738 --> 01:03:24,417
Get out of the water!

540
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:29,502
I can't find a way to you.    Get out through the skylite

541
01:03:29,502 --> 01:03:30,341
Hurry up!

542
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:54,398
Jake!

543
01:04:09,969 --> 01:04:12,608
Come on. I don't want you to see this.

544
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,119
They took my penis! They took my penis.

545
01:04:30,145 --> 01:04:31,744
They took my penis.

546
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,631
Jake hurry up, the water's getting higher

547
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:46,344
Jake!

548
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:47,345
Kelly!

549
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,278
Hurry up!

550
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:53,801
Can you reach the skylite?

551
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:53,645
Chew on this muthafuckers!

552
01:06:58,209 --> 01:06:59,289
Everybody out!

553
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,985
All ashore!

554
01:07:23,547 --> 01:07:24,907
Everybody out!

555
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:39,309
No! No!

556
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:12,541
Hold this.

557
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:14,782
[phone ringing]

558
01:08:16,866 --> 01:08:17,985
This is Sheriff Forester.

559
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:20,186
Mum? - Jake.

560
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:21,825
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

561
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:22,852
What?

562
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,030
Where are Laura and Zane?

563
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,231
They're with me on the boat.

564
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,732
Oh my God, Jake.

565
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:30,592
Whatever you do, do not go into the water!

566
01:08:31,356 --> 01:08:33,676
You don't understand, Mum. Our boat is sinking.

567
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,039
Where are you?

568
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:42,322
What are you doing?

569
01:08:58,295 --> 01:08:59,455
I'm coming with you.

570
01:08:59,896 --> 01:09:00,694
Let's go.

571
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:24,592
That's mum.

572
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,083
Mum! Hey!

573
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:31,437
Jack's boat.

574
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,000
How are we gonna get the boat close? - I don't know.

575
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:39,203
The rope. Do you think it will reach?

576
01:09:39,965 --> 01:09:42,845
Jake, I'm gonna throw you the rope.     I want you to tie it to the highest railing

577
01:09:42,849 --> 01:09:43,850
Okay, Mum.

578
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:46,978
Tied? - Yeah.

579
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:51,232
Back up a bit.

580
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:56,094
Watch out for rocks.

581
01:09:57,113 --> 01:09:58,490
Watch out!

582
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:00,938
Ready? - Yeah.

583
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:06,220
That's good.Stay at what you are far.

584
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:10,377
Yeah.

585
01:10:22,714 --> 01:10:25,114
Keep it tight. I've got my radio

586
01:10:26,718 --> 01:10:28,037
Just get there.

587
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,769
Mum, are you okay?

588
01:10:50,774 --> 01:10:52,454
Is this everybody on the boat?

589
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:56,096
No, Kelly is stuck down in the cabin.    We can't get her out.

590
01:10:56,297 --> 01:10:57,737
We can't get her out. - Kelly?

591
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:00,051
God! Kelly?

592
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:05,784
Can you grab my arm?

593
01:11:06,057 --> 01:11:08,393
Help me get out of here. Water is getting higher!

594
01:11:08,507 --> 01:11:11,626
- Can you reach the skylite?    It doesn't matter. It's fucking stuck!

595
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:18,312
Jake!

596
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,236
I'm scared!

597
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:20,474
Please help!

598
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:26,119
Mum, hurry! - Kelly?

599
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,760
- Were gonna die. We are not gonna die, OK?

600
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:39,090
I need your help! Please!

601
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,289
It's the only way to reach it under the ship.

602
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:44,220
Get the rope.

603
01:11:45,173 --> 01:11:47,374
What are you talking about? We can't leave her down there.

604
01:11:47,613 --> 01:11:51,054
Once I get everyone cross the rope, I'm goona come back for her.

605
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:53,377
No,I'm not leaving without her mum!

606
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:56,819
Jesus, Jake! The only way to get to her is for you to get into the water

607
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:59,381
I'm not gonna let you do that!

608
01:11:59,543 --> 01:12:02,063
The reason she came on this boat was coz of me

609
01:12:02,266 --> 01:12:03,945
That's my fault.

610
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,029
I'm not going without her.

611
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:11,631
- This isn't gonna hold much longer. Let's go!

612
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,873
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and when I come back,

613
01:12:17,155 --> 01:12:18,555
we are gonna do it together.

614
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:20,715
Alright.

615
01:12:21,398 --> 01:12:23,918
We're gonna keep the 2 little ones between us, you go first.

616
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:29,162
Can you do this?     - You better believe it! I don't pole dance for nothing!

617
01:12:32,886 --> 01:12:35,166
You have a lot of explaining to do.

618
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,410
Ready?

619
01:12:46,336 --> 01:12:48,696
Be careful, don't look down. Let's go.

620
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:58,920
Just like at the playground guys,

621
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,964
... hand over hand

622
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:04,627
Don't look down.

623
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:07,762
Don't look down, alright.

624
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,558
Come on, you can do this.

625
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:25,613
Don't look down.

626
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:42,881
GET OFF ME!

627
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,103
No! No!

628
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,110
Godammit!

629
01:14:11,076 --> 01:14:12,595
Laura, listen to me!

630
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:15,830
If you move fast, it will not get you.

631
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:16,831
You have to move now!

632
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:19,320
Come on!

633
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:21,922
Do it!

634
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:33,250
OK guys, you're here.

635
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:38,895
You did it.

636
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,260
Damn it!

637
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:53,451
Let's go, keep moving!

638
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:58,989
Are you ok?

639
01:14:59,189 --> 01:15:00,429
Cut the engine.

640
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:02,950
What are you doing?

641
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:05,914
Jake, what are you doing?

642
01:15:08,756 --> 01:15:09,916
What are you doing?

643
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,238
Jake!

644
01:15:11,518 --> 01:15:12,837
Jake, do not!

645
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,639
They want blood, don't they?

646
01:15:15,362 --> 01:15:16,241
Well, we'll give them.

647
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:32,291
Wet T-shirt, wet t-shirt.

648
01:16:53,632 --> 01:16:54,311
Jake!

649
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:56,991
Oh my God! Oh my God!

650
01:16:59,996 --> 01:17:01,475
We're gonna get out of here. Both of us!

651
01:17:03,598 --> 01:17:07,881
- I'm in! I need you guys to pull us out as fast as possible!    Do you copy?

652
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,600
- Ok, we're ready when you are.

653
01:17:16,126 --> 01:17:17,967
Jake, what are you doing? They're gonna come back.

654
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:20,969
I gave them a snack. That's gonna hold them off for a while at least

655
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,094
I need you to tie these together ok? - Why?

656
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,400
Just do it!

657
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:32,697
Where are you going?

658
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,940
Jake!

659
01:17:53,634 --> 01:17:55,514
Can you hold it tight?

660
01:17:57,797 --> 01:18:01,839
Hold your breath, we'll swim to the bottom of the boat.

661
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,041
I need you to hold on tight. Can you hold on tight to me?

662
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:16,209
I need you to pull us out in 10 seconds, do you copy?     - Copy that. 10 seconds on your signal.

663
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:17,849
Get the kids down.

664
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:30,339
10. .. 10  10. .. 10

665
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:49,471
6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ...  6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ...

666
01:18:50,394 --> 01:18:53,634
... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 .  ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 .

667
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,413
Come on!  Come on!

668
01:19:14,371 --> 01:19:15,250
Come on, fucking thing!

669
01:19:32,223 --> 01:19:32,982


670
01:19:55,799 --> 01:19:56,959
Oh my God!

671
01:19:58,322 --> 01:19:59,001
Holy shit!

672
01:20:18,736 --> 01:20:19,575
Are you alright?

673
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:24,419
Kick your legs, come on!

674
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:27,861
Let's go!

675
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,904
You're alright.

676
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:35,387
Breathe, you're ok.

677
01:20:37,309 --> 01:20:39,028
You're ok.

678
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:41,591
Oh my God! It's good to have you on board!

679
01:20:44,634 --> 01:20:45,473
Shit.

680
01:20:49,718 --> 01:20:51,317
Look mum, over there.

681
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,200
They died.

682
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:56,642
They're all dead.

683
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:12,205
You did it Jake!

684
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,015
Hey, it worked.

685
01:21:15,177 --> 01:21:18,137
I thought dynamite fishing is illegal in these parts sheriff?

686
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,780
[over radio] -Sheriff! Sherrif?

687
01:21:22,622 --> 01:21:23,941
Yes, this Julie.

688
01:21:25,903 --> 01:21:29,344
Julie, we have a major problem.

689
01:21:29,587 --> 01:21:34,868
I'm looking out at a school of dead piranha.     It's not all of them, but it's a good start.

690
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,270
You don't understand.

691
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,112
The specimen you left with me 

692
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:44,477
has no mature reproductive organs.

693
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,117
- What? What are you talking about?

694
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,362
The piranhas that killed those divers,    the ones you're hunting for...

695
01:21:54,484 --> 01:21:56,444
They're not fully developed!

696
01:21:56,885 --> 01:21:58,926
They're the babies!

697
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,090
Babies?

698
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:08,935
Well, where are the parents?
