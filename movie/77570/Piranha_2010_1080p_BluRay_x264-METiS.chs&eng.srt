“美丽湖畔假期”现场，欢乐写在每个游客脸上

12
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,607
当你今天早上醒来... ...不只是派对，而且

13
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:05,295
维多利亚湖好似成了太阳

会见证到一些奇特的事，而不只是...

15

"你好吗:春节假期"

16

Obvious,it was a mistake.

我看到是你刚毁了私人财产.
Mistake or no mistake, 
you just destroyed private property.

And from the smell of your breath, 
I suggest you take the ticket.

你穿着棕色的制服很性感.
Come on.You look pretty hot in tan.

不是棕色, 是淡棕色的

是啊, 希望我们能到码头另一头
Yeah, if we can make it to the end of the pier

134
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:26,828
你是说我太老了, 还是太重了?
You mean I'm to old, or too heavy?

135
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:28,633
我想你是太胆小了!
I think you're too chicken-shit!

136
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,971
顺便说下, 戈登昨晚打来了电话.
By the way, Gordon called last night.

137
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:35,124
是吗?
Yeah?

138
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:39,156
他说U.S.G.S.测到了湖地下强烈的地震活动.
He said that U.S.G.S. recorded heavy seismic activity below the lake.

139
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,423
真的?
Really?

140
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:43,111
是的, 他们会派来一队地震学家潜水员
Yeah, they're sending in a team of seismologist divers

141
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,374
他还告诉他们你会护送他们出去!
And he told them that you're gonna escort them out!

142
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,949
天啊.
Jesus Christ.

143
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,176
我们刚被20,000个孩子入侵
We've just been invaded by 20,000 kids

144
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,173
现在我们有些忙.
makes us a little busy at the moment.

145
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,479
我知道. 我也是这样告诉他的
I know. That's what I told him

146
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,500
[咯吱声]
[creaking]

147
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,120
听起来情况不妙
This doesnt sound too good

148
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,293
那些潜水员什么时候来?
So, what time are the divers gonna get here?

149
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,945
他说大约10点.
He said around 10.

150
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,301
该死.
Shit.

151
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,830
再靠近点.
Come on, just a little more.

152
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:45,710
我抓不到
I can't get it

153
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,020
- 朱尔斯!
- Jules!

154
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:55,964
把手给我!
Give me your hand!

155
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,757
你觉得是螺旋桨干了这些吗?
Do you think a propeller could've done this?

156
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,832
我很怀疑. 看这些骨头. 没有破裂的
I doubt it. Look at the bones. Nothing broken

157
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,864
像是中毒, 是酸性分解
It looks like toxic, are acidic decomposition

158
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,129
看来尸体已经在水下数周了
it's as it this body has been in the water for weeks

159
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,891
如果我说我在考虑关闭这条湖，你怎么看?
What would you say if I told that I'm thinking about closing the lake?

160
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:23,846
...至少得等到验尸报告   - 验尸报告还得好几天
...at least until we get an autopsy report   
- An autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days

161
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,225
不可能关闭湖.
It'd be easier to drain this lake, than close it.

162
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,606
它是我们镇里的主要经济来源.
I's a big financial week for our town.

163
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
我已经习以为常了.
I'm gettin too old for this

164
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,691
我们不会对妈妈撒谎的.  
- 对, 我们不会对妈妈撒谎的.
We're not liying to mum.  - Yeah, we won't lie to mum.

165
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:45,263
别, 年年如此.   
我困在这儿陪着你们
Come on guys, every year it's the same.   
I'm stuck here with you

166
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:46,760
错过了所有的春假乐趣.
and miss all the spring break fun.

167
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,412
你是说春假里的波波吧!
You mean spring break boobies!

168
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,947
我给你们保姆佣金怎么样?
What if I give you guys the cash for the baby-sitting?

169
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,329
60快就成交.
Sixty bucks and you gotta deal.

170
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,019
60? 妈只付我40.
Sixty? But I'm only getting paid forty.

171
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:56,285
20快欺骗附加费!
Twenty dollar deception surcharge!

172
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,580
别接电话, 别开门
Don't pick up the phone, don't answer the door

173
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,347
别离开家.
and don't leave the house.

174
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,920
好吗? 我靠你们了.
OK? I'm counting on you guys.

175
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,264
好吗?
Alright?

176
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
两条规则.  
你往湖里丢一件垃圾, 你就得捡10件
Town rules son.  
You throw a peice of trash in the lake, you gotta pick up 10 peices

177
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:45,558
潜水后, 我们被要求出席 'Cocomos'  
亚利桑那州立啦啦队.
After the dive, our presence is requested at 'Cocomos'  
The Arizona State cheerleading team.

178
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,247
嗨, 我是警长福雷斯特.
Hi, I'm Sheriff Forester.

179
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,359
鲍勃戈登要我带你们过去.
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

180
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,741
很高兴收到协会邀请
It's nice to have a welcoming committee around here

181
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:53,661
我猜那也是技术设备?
I assume that's technical equipment too?

182
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:55,351
是的, 萨姆, 把那些还回去.
Yeah, Sam, give those back.

183
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,769
根据震中坐标
According to the epicenter coordinates

184
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:01,534
我们得去这里.
we need to go here.

185
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,450
好的, 过去要20分钟
Ok, that's about 20 minutes out

186
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,333
等你们准备好 - 好的
Ready when you are. -Alright

187
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,360
你看不到很多女人在这牛仔乡村执法.
You dont see many women working Law Enforcement out here in cowboy country.

188
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
你也看不到很多牛仔
You dont see a lot of cowboys though

189
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
凯莉.
Kelly.

190
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,800
杰克.
Jake.

191
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,172
你在给谁当保姆呢?
Who exactly are you baby-sitting here?

192
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,820
说起来好笑.
This is a funny story actually.

193
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,854



194
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:06,271
Wow. 看看这些白痴.
Wow. Look at those idiots.

195
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:07,692
是啊, 太蠢了.
Yeah, it's terrible.

196
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,378
裸男! 嘿 裸男, 我在跟你说话呢.
Sandrat! Hey Sandrat, I'm talking to you.

197
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:15,410
你到底去哪儿了?  
我们给女孩涂了润滑油
Where the hell have you been?  
We've got the girls lubed up

198
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,791
我们已经准备好了. 
我要扣你的薪水了!
We're ready to roll. 
I'm docking your paycheck!

199
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,213
来啊.
Let's go.

200
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,935
我看到你一直在观察的人了.
Now I see what you've been scouting last 15 minutes.

201
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:28,967
凯莉, 很高兴见到你, 我知道你该去...
Kelly, it was great to see you, I know you gotta get going...

202
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,811
嗨 凯莉, 我叫 德里克.琼斯.
Hi Kelly, I'm Derick Jones.

203
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:32,271

你认识这家伙?
You know this guy?

205
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:37,071
杰克? 杰克是我的伙计!
 Jake? Jake is my boy!

206
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,259
他是个有想法的人! 内在, 智慧!
He's the man with the plan! The insight, the knowledge!

207
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:44,062
很好. 那些女孩, 他们不是你们的人，对吗?
Great. Those girls, they aren't with you are they?

208
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:47,056
他们是我们的人, 怎么? 你对女孩感兴趣吗?
Yes, why? Are you into girls?

209
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,706
不, 我只是带他在镇里转转.  
像那些热门景点.
No, I'm just showing him around town.  
All the hotspots, stuff like that.

210
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,582
这工作叫取景, 凯莉 你该一起来.
The job is called location scout,

211
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:58,040
我们今天要创造电影历史.
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

212
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,151
不, 她已经有其它的安排了.
No, she's got other plans already.

213
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,418
凯莉，你喜欢香槟酒吗?
Kelly do you like champagne?

214
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:10,713
我爱香槟, 事实上我爱 ...
I love champagne, actually I love ...

215

217
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,722
嘿，凯莉 亲爱的. 
今天和我们一起玩怎样?
Hey Kelly baby. 
What happened to hanging with us today?

00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,294
他是你的男朋友还是?   
- 不是, 他只是我的一个...
Is he your boyfriend or something?   
- No, he's just a boy from school...

219
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,444
...说有过老汉推车经验的同学, 事实上，他没有!
...who said he has back-stage passes, when actually, he doesn't!

220
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,288
- 玩得开心! - 来啊 凯莉!
- Have a good day! - Come on Kelly!

221
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,747
穿上这些衬衫吧.
Take these T-shirts.

222
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:44,471
不会吧.
What the fuck.

223
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:46,081
那是德里克.琼斯耶!
That was Derick Jones!

224
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,560
那是杰克.福雷斯特?

225
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:06,361
4点的"湿衬衫"大赛再见.
See you at 4 in wet t-shirt contest.

226
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,126
戴夫, 我们得谈谈
Dave, we have to talk about this

227
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:10,701
我们跟杰克说过我们会呆在家里的.
We told Jake that we'd stay at the house.

228
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:13,119
我告诉过他我会去捕鱼的.
I told him that I would fish.

229
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:15,117
如果没有鱼的话我才不会去.
I can't if there are no fish.

230
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:16,730
人太多了.
The lake's too busy.

231
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,072
来吧. 沙岛离这很近
Come on. Sand Island is really close

232
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:31,862
我应该带上我的喇叭.
I should've brought my trombone.

233
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,544
不行! "做些女孩该做的事吧 日光浴什么的"!
No way! "Be a girl and sunbathe or something!

234
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:40,464
当我成了摇滚明星, 你还得看我是否接纳你!
When I become a rock star, just see if I let YOU be in my group!

235
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,845
别吹了!
Give me a break,dude!

236
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,379
你吹喇叭!
You play the trombone!

237
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,200
女士们... 来点香槟...   
- 谢谢 ... 这里能提供的最好的东西
Here we go ladies... a little Champagne...

238
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,878
干杯!
Cheers!

239
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,221
敬我们最新加入的 '狂野 狂野 女孩'
to our newest 'Wild Wild Girl'

240
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:20,173
这是我们来这儿的原因. 德里克想要捕捉纯真.
That's why we came here. Derick wants to capture innocence.

241
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,132
都是关于纯真
It's all about innocence

242
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,160
就像她一样.
Just like her.

243
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
别担心. 德里克只是在演戏.   
你也许可以让他闭嘴
Don't worry. Derick's just making his play.   
You might as well ask him not to breathe

244
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:37,225
这就是规律. 给女孩一台摄像机，她就会在镜头前表演.
It's the rules. Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

245
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
这就像是物理定律.
It's like a law of physics.

246
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,027
我看到过那家伙勾引了很多女人.
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

247
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,023
她没搞砸你的派对吧，是吗?
She's not messing up your party is she?

248
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,021
我才不关心. 她不是我的女朋友.
What do I care. She's not my girlfriend.

249
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,168
这很好. 我过得很开心.
This is great. I'm having a great time.

250
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:53,508
我们要狂野, 我要狂野.
We're going wild, I'm going wild.

251
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:56,427
嘿, 杰克. 还有多远? 来啊!
Hey, Jake. How far is this place? Come on!

252
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,654
我们快到了
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there

253
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,187
说到狂野...
So speaking of going wild...

254
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:05,375
你还什么都没看到呢!
you haven't seen anything yet!

255
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,665
为什么不加入我们?
Why not join us?

256
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,000
嘿, 怎么了?   
- 关门, 你会毁了镜头!
Hey, what's up guys?   
- Close that door, you're ruining our shot!

257
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:54,406
来啊 裸男. 来看看.
Come on Sandrat. Get with the program.

258
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,080
他们来了, 他们来了. 我的女神们来了.
Here they come, here they come. Here come my nymphs.

259
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,356
噢 天啊!
Oh my God!

260
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:06,233
看! 有波波的美人鱼
Check it out! The fish, with boobies

261
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,036
如果所有的鱼都这样, 我就上鱼!
If all fish look like that, I would fuck fish!

262
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:15,336
漂亮的姑娘们. 你喜欢吧, 杰克?
Looking good ladies. You like this, right Jake?

263
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,986
今天该你付我们钱, 而不是我们付你钱!
You should be paying us today, not the other way around!

264
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:27,279
看看这些水生女神婊子. 这是性感的安迪!
Look at these goddess aquatic bitches. This is hot Andy!

265
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:29,046
这太性感了. 这就是我要的所有
This is so hot. This is what it's all about

266
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,271
啤酒, 阳光 还有在水下亲吻抚摸的裸女们!
Beer, sun and naked hunnies making out under water!

267
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:48,365
妈, 你那里怎么了?
Mum, what's going on there?

268
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,973
你怎么没接家里的电话?
How come you didn't pick up the home phone?

269
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,623
我一直在打你电话.
I've been trying to reach you.

270
00:26:57,044 --> 00:27:00,999
我在屋外面. 你要我接的我现在就可以去接.
I was outside. I can go and get it if you need me to.

271
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
不用了, 没事.
No, that's okay.

272
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:07,566
噢 天!
Oh my God!

273
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:08,833
什么?
What?

274
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:14,019
没什么, 是孩子们.
Nothing, just kids.

275
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:17,935
他们在屋外捕鱼...
They're outside fishing...

276
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,201
... 看到他们在一起玩 ...
... and it's really nice to see them ...

277
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:22,351
... 真的很高兴.
... playing with each other.

278
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:26,002
把屁股贴在玻璃上!
Put your ass on the glass!

279
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,650
杰克, 有人跟你在一起吗?
Jake is someone there with you?

280
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,912
没有, 没有, 没有. 
No, no, no. 

281
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:35,409
只有在湖面的孩子们. 这里很吵.
Just the kids on the lake. It's crazy here. You know how it is.

282
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,020
亲爱的, 今天不要让赞恩或劳拉靠近湖, 听见了吗?
Honey, I don't want Zane or Laura near the lake today, you hear me?

283
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:43,973
好的, 我们会呆在屋里，我们会看电视什么的.
Alright, we will stay in and we'll watch TV.

284
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,582
好的, 我得挂了. 非常感谢你
Alright, I gotta go. Thank you so much for this

285
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,348
我会尽快回家的, 好吗?
I'll try to come home early, ok?

286
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,343
好的, 好的. 我爱你. 我得挂了.
Alright, alright. I love you. I gotta go.

287
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:56,800
凯莉?
Kelly?

288
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,252
凯莉, 你在哪儿?
Kelly, where are you?

289
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,234
凯莉?
Kelly?

290
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,395
杰克, 你错过了剩下的戏了.
Jake, you missed the rest of the show.

291
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,930
上来. 拿些毛巾.
Let's go. Towels for the girls.

292
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:11,457
Wow! 太棒了! 做得好. 看你系的船
Wow! Great! good work. Way to tie up a canoe

293
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:12,723
我一定忘记打结了.
I must've gotten my knots mixed up.

294
00:29:14,324 --> 00:29:18,330
你一条鱼都没钓到, 还弄丢了我们唯一的船.  
今天过得真充实.
So you catch zero fish, and lose us our only boat.  
Today is just full of accomplishments

295
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,440
杰克会杀了我们.
Jake's gonna kill us.

296
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,248
有人会看到我们的. 看呐, 那里有些船.
Somebody will see us. See, there are some boats over there.

297
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:27,435
别折腾了. 他们看不见我们, 离太远了.
Don't waste your time. They'll never see us, it's way too far.

298
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,236
Hello!
Hello!

299
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:38,226
Hello!
Hello!

300
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:55,853
我们需要帮助!
We need help!

301
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,503
我们在这里!
We're over here!

302
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,421
来人啊，救命.
Help us, somebody.

303
00:30:05,532 --> 00:30:07,182
我们在这里, 救命!
We're over here, help!

304
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,712
Woah! 看看那东西的大小!
Woah! Look at the size of that!

305
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,901
这是什么? 洞穴系统吗?
What is it? A cavern system?

306
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,396
我看来像是地下湖泊.
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

307
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,313
你看见那个缺口了吗? -看见了.
You see this gap here? -Yes.

308
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:17,155
地震打开了那个缺口, 现在它是个连接的通到.
The quake opened that up, now it's a connecting passage.

309
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:18,961
湖下湖?
A lake under a lake?

310
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:21,188
正解. 但还在你的管辖区域.
That's right. Sorry but it's still your jurisdiction.

311
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:24,144
它是这一区域火山脊的一部分.
This is part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

312
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:25,949
这是它的美丽之处.
That's the beauty of it.

313
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:27,985
我们会是首批探险的人.
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

314
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,518
我不知道你为什么对那垃圾这么兴奋.
I don't know why you get s o excited by that crap.

315
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,629
我们看到的只有礁石和沙粒.
All we ever see is rocks and sand.

316
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:56,634
我得警告他们, 下面不会很漂亮的.
I should warn them, it's not very pretty down there.

317
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:59,246
游客把湖当成了垃圾桶.
Tourists treat this lake like it's a garbage can.

318
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:01,935
下面怎么样?
How's it going down there?

319
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,700
警长说下面的可是宝藏
Sheriff said that it's a real treasure trove down there

320
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:10,115
所以我要那些尸体, 还有上'Jugs'杂志封面
so I've got dibs on the old body spray, and 'Jugs' magazines

321
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,534
我要那些家用器具.
I got dibs on home appliances.

322
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,916
我要那些失踪的大学女生
I got dibs on missing college girls

323
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,600
天啊!
Oh my God!

324
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,133
从没见过这么长的.
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

325
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:26,897
你能专心在任务上吗.
Could you keep your mind on the task.

326
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:35,615
诺瓦克，至少有200英尺
At least 200 feet Novak

327
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:42,988
几乎可以看到全部.
Almost full visibility.

328
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,668
你该看看这个. 太不可思议了!
You should see this. It's unbelieveable!

329
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,929
诺瓦克, 你听得到吗? - 可以, 很清楚
Novak, you copy? - Yes, pretty good

330
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:05,303
好的，伙计们.你们离连接通道还有90英尺
Ok,guy.You're about 90 feet to the entrance of the connecting passage

331
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:11,178
很近了
It looks like single file time

332
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:12,557
我先进去
I'll go first

333
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,840
不, 我先去侦察.
No, I should do the preliminary scout.

334
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,477
没有冒犯的意思, 你会搞砸的!
No offense, you'll get us stuck!

335
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,397
宝贝, 我就像条鳗鱼.
Baybe, I'm like an eel.

336
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:21,432
电动的鳗鱼，可以进入非常小的缝隙.
Electrical eel can get into small spaces that it is shocking.

337
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,619
这很奇怪
That's weird

338
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:27,385
他们在这里，而且分开了
Here they are and they're splitting up

339
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,681
伙计们,进行的还顺利吧? 我这儿有点收不到信号了.
Guys,is everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

340
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:52,116
我这里温度降得很快
I'm getting a serious drop in temperature

341
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,880
至少降了30度.
it's at least 30 degrees colder.

342
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:55,189
你大概在地下湖的入口
You're probably at the mouth of the underwater lake

343
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:58,607
看见什么了吗?
Do you have any visual?

344
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,870
我要进洞了
I'm entering the cave

345
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
天啊!
Jesus!

346
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,909
看不到尽头.
It seems endless.

347
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
你们得看看这个.
You gotta see this.

348
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:44,422
太不可思议了
This is incredible

349
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:44,450
你在下面看到什么了?
What do you see down there?

350
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:47,905
有东西咬了我!
Something just bit me!

351
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,880
好吧, 我想你喜欢这类东西?
Yes, okay, I thought you like that kinda stuff?

352
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:06,456
山姆! 山姆! 回答我!
Sam! Sam! Answer me!

353
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,520
发生了什么.  - 什么?  我不知道. 给我脚蹼.
Something's happening.  - What?  I don't know. Give me my flippers.

354
00:36:59,223 --> 00:37:00,259
把他拖出水!
Get him out of the water!

355
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,203
天啊!
Oh my God!

356
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:43,234
你身体就像神殿, 该是感谢上帝的时候了.
Your body is a temple, and now it is time to thank the Gods.

357
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,997
安德鲁, 摄像机.
Andrew, camera.

358
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,994
该你了. 不, 不, 不.
Come on you. No, no, no.

359
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,259
不, 谢谢. 我想我玩够了.
No, thanks. I think I've already had too much.

360
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,880
来啊, 难道不想在美丽的祭坛上朝拜吗.
Come on, don't you want to worship at a beautiful altar.

361
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:58,442
我知道你更喜欢香槟, 但是你得相信我们, 你可以信任克里斯特尔.
I know you prefer champagne, but you believe us, you can trust Crystal.

362
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:00,630
别 德里克, 她说了不行.
Come on Derick, she said no.

363
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,122
不是, 她说 '不 谢谢', 这不一样.   
她明白感谢才是正确的态度.
No, she said 'no thanks', there's a difference.   
She understands that gratitude is the right attitude.

364
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:11,615
凯莉, 来啊, 相信我们.   
我们从来不撒谎!
Kelly, come on, trust us.   
It's never cheating if it's with another chick!

365
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:11,800
来啊. - 试试.
Come on. -Try.

366
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,760
来啊, 这很有趣
Come on, it's fun

367
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
找点乐子, 做吧! 每个人都做的
Have fun, do it! Everybody's doing it

368
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,250
你不会是想剥夺她的乐趣吧?
You're not trying to take away her fun are you?

369
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:21,407
她... 她不是我的女朋友.
Like I said,she's er... she's not my girlfriend.

370
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:25,017
好! 我做.
Fine! I'll do it.

371
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
你先舔盐 - 开始了
First you lick the salt - Here we go

372
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,083
过来这里
Come over here

373
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:34,234
然后你舔干龙舌兰酒.
Then you suck up the tequila.

374
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
你没必要这么做.   
- 我想我们不需要你这样的保姆在这儿,杰克.
You don't have to do it.   
- I don't think we need any of your babysitting here Jake.

375
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
好.
Alright.

376
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:22,393
要不凯莉和杰克试试?
How about try with Jake and Kelly?

377
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,314
什么? - 什么?
What? - What?

378
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:24,720
不,我想她不... - 我可以
No,I don't think she... -I'm ok

379
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:27,271
来吧, 我们今天要不要拍三级片了啊?   
做个决定吧
Come on guys, are we shooting porn today or not?   
Lets make a decision

380
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,103
谢谢 克里斯特尔. 来 凯莉.
Thanks Crystal. Come Kelly.

381
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,363
对, 放点盐.
Yes, and salt.

382
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:46,511
一点龙舌兰酒.
A little bit tequila.

383
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
开始吧.
Let's go.

384
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,160
古德曼先生?
Mr. Goodman?

385
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,062
来啦.
Coming.

386
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,789
来啦, 别急
I'm coming, hold your horses

387
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:35,823
商店关门了
The store is closed

388
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,114
我想知道这鬼东西在我的湖里干了什么?
I want to know what the hell this thing is doing in my lake?

389
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,762
你哪弄来的?
Where did you get this?

390
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,452
在湖中央.
In the middle of the lake.

391
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:54,102
那里死了2个人!
Where there are 2 people dead!

392
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,318
- 天啊!  "天啊" 
- Oh my!God!  "Oh my" yeah that's right

393
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:06,661
那是条食人鱼吗?
Excuse me, but is that a fucking Piranha?

394
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:10,502
还不止这一条.  
- 有成千上万条.
And it's not the only one.  
- There are thousands of them.

395
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,768
成千上万! 它们都发疯了!
Thousands! And they're pissed!

396
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,533
我听过这类事情.
I heard about these things happening.

397
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,913
就像是新泽西州的小短鼻鳄,  
有人把它们留在那儿 ...
It's like those baby alligators in New Jersey,  
someone leaves them ...

398
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,373
... 然后它们繁衍了. - 什么?
... and then they bread. - What?

399
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:22,944
谁把这些鱼放进了湖里?
Who released these fish into the lake?

400
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:24,518
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

401
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:27,937
这种特别的食人鱼
This particular of piranha

402
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,356
早在200万年前
vanished from the face of the earth

403
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,853
就灭绝了!
more than two million years ago!

404
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,345
他要去哪里?
Where's he going?

405
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:45,180
允许我... 介绍...
Allow me... to introduce...

406
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,973
臀点脂鲤属. 食人鱼的祖先
The Pygocentrus. The original piranha

407
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:58,353
它们过去生活在科罗拉多河
They used to swim the Colorado River

408
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:02,078
直到冰河世纪.
Right up until the Ice Age.

409
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,381
我还是不明白你们怎么找到条... 活的?
I still don't understand how you found one... alive?

410
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,791
我们通过地震打开的一个缝隙找到条地下湖. 
We discovered a subterrane lake, through a rift created by the quake

411
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,940
它怎么能活这么久, 离开地面?
How could it have survived so long, cut off from the surface?

412
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:20,205
同类相食.
Cannibalism.

413
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,237
它们一定互相争斗才活下来.
They must have fought each other to survive.

414
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:25,928
看.
Look.

415
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,192
疤痕.
Scars.

416
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,180
注意看眼睛.
Notice the eyes.

417
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:35,954
天啊. 它们好像怒视着你.
Jesus. It's like they're staring back at you

418
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:41,096
不, 不, 不. 没用眼睛看.是在感觉 .
No, no, no. Not staring. Sensing.

419
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,046
天啊! 别再这样做了.
God! Don't do that.

420
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:53,002
食人鱼成群捕猎.
Piranhas hunt in packs.

421
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:57,036
不是为了防卫, 而是为了集中绝对优势兵力.
Not for protection, but for overwhelming force.

422
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,145
他们很有组织, 有条不紊
They're organised, methodical

423
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:06,521
咬的第一口要流出血, 流出的血会吸引成群的食人鱼
The first bite draws the blood, the blood draws the pack

424
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,787
那我们怎么阻止它们?
So how are we going to stop them?

425
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:12,089
抱歉, 你不会想要再回到湖面上吧?
I'm sorry, you're not actually thinking about going back out onto the lake?

426
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:16,852
它们是杀人机器，但它们还是鱼.   
你们可以抓到它并杀了它.
They are killing machines but they are still fish.   
You can catch them or kill them.

427
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:20,731
但如果真有成千上万 ...  
-嗯?
But if there really are thousands ...  
-Yes?

428
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,684
昨天就该开始行动了.
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

429
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,350
该死.
Shit.

430
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:38,384
是我的弟弟和妹妹.
My little brother and sister.

431
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:40,457
他们在求救吗?
Are they waving for help?

432
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:45,028
我不知道. 他们这时候应该在家里.  
我这时候也应该在家里.
I don't know. They should be home right now.  
I should be home right now.

433
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,600
杰克, 你在干什么? 你会错过我值钱的镜头.
Jake, what are you doing? You're gonna miss my money shot

434
00:44:48,024 --> 00:44:49,713
是我的家人! 他们可能遇到麻烦了
It's my familly alright! They could be in trouble

435
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:54,668
你才会遇到麻烦，如果你现在没拍到我飞行的妞!
You'd be the one in trouble if you don't get my flying cacas right now!

436
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,741
你怎么了?
What the hell is wrong with you man?

437
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:02,540
我怎么了?
What's wrong with me?

438
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,148
妈的, 你错过了, 你错过了, 你错过了.
Oh Godamit, your missing it, your missing it, your missing it.

439
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,254
天 你错过了! 你有什么毛病?
Oh you missed it! What is wrong with you?

440
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:16,096
听着, 他们就站在那里.
Listen, they're stranded out there.

441
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:17,480
他们也许需要我们的帮助
They might need my help

442
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,433
听我说. 我的母亲是警长.
Listen to me. My mum is sheriff.

443
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,788
好吧. 我们顺便路过那岛.  
把那些诱饵鱼扔进船里.
OK. Let's swing by the island.  
Throw the minnows in the boat.

444
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:44,478
很好.会很有趣的.
It'll be great.It'll be fun.

445
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:10,900
拉我上去!
Get me up!

446
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:24,956
拉我上去!
Get me up!

447
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,723
发生了什么?
What's going on?

448
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,700
维多利亚湖, 准备好你的乳房了吗?!
Alright Lake Victoria, are you ready for some titties?!

449
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,740
看看那些自慰武器!
Look at those weapons of masturbation!

450
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,100
换个!
Change!

451
00:47:37,503 --> 00:47:38,846
耶, 我们需要国民警卫队 ...
Yes, I need the National Guard ...

452
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:42,379
...我需要海岸警卫队!   
我需要所有你们能调配的部队!
...I need the Coast Guard!   
I need all the forces you have the power to deploy!

453
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,620
都回到岸边!
Everybody back to the beach!

454
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,380
都回去!
Everybody back!

455
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,958
阅读圣经.
Read the Bible.

456
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:11,337
别谈信仰. 把船靠岸.  
别再谈什么信仰
Don't talk about faith. Take the boat back.  
No more talk about faith

457
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,091
搞什么鬼?
What the fuck?

458
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:32,035
我们是维多利亚湖警署,
This is the Lake Victoria Sherrifs Department,

459
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:35,761
警长宣布进入紧急状态.
The Sherrif has declared an emergency.

460
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:37,980
别担心, 我们带来了啤酒!
Don't worry, we've got beer over here!

461
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,180
人肉炮弹!
Cannonball!

462
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,060
我要你离开水, 现在!
I need you out of the water, now!

463
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,220
是杰克吗? 他怎么在这儿?
Is that Jake? Why is he here?

464
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,980
我不知道.
I don't know.

465
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:27,566
我们完蛋了. - 不, 他才是.
We are so busted. - No, he is.

466
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:28,340
我还没捕到鱼!
I didn't even catch a fish!

467
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,332
减速.
Slow down.

468
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,581
好吧, 杰克,这事不怪我.  
都是赞恩的主意
OK, Jake,I'm not taking the fall for this.  
It was all Zanes idea

469
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:48,499
我给了你60快让你呆在家里. 你们怎么这样.
I paid you $60 to stay home. What do you mean.

470
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:49,996
我还你40快，我们扯平.
I'll give you 40 and we are even.

471
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:52,992
你们上船, 回家，该结束了.
How about you get on a boat, go home and end of story.

472
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,254
上船.
Just get on the boat.

473
00:49:57,793 --> 00:50:01,402
我们本该在一个小时前就到海滩参加活动了.
We should've been on the beach an hour ago 
for the muthafucking main event.

474
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,340
来! - 上去.
Come on! - Go ahead.

475
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:07,584
从这里走要当心.   
礁石可能会撞坏引擎的
Be careful getting out of here.   
The rocks can strip away the engine

476
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,187
你可以躺下休息会儿. 
Come on,you can rest down here. 

477
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:20,104
把赞恩和劳拉带在身边,  
我不想他们和那些人在一起.
Take Zane and Laura with you,  
I don't want them anywhere near them.

478
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,754
水真清澈.
The water is so clear.

479
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:29,245
那是什么鱼?
What kind of fish was that?

480
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:30,474
我不知道.
I don't know.

481
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,625
我会让他们带我们回家的, 好吗?
I'm gonna make them take us home right now, ok?

482
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,619
怎么了?
What is that?

483
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,740
发生了什么?
What happened?

484
00:50:39,426 --> 00:50:40,155
你们还好吗?
Are you guys okay?

485
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,343
我猜我们撞到了什么东西.
I think we hit something.

486
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,300
安德鲁! 安德鲁, 发生了什么?
Andrew! Andrew, what the hell is going on now?

487
00:50:54,248 --> 00:50:56,014
我不知道. 我们被什么东西困住了.
I don't know. We're stuck on something.

488
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:58,087
修好它，该死
Well, fix it Godamit

489
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,159
到处都是礁石.   
- 是的, 它们就在下面.
There are rocks everywhere.   
- Yeah, they're right down here.

490
00:51:01,813 --> 00:51:02,811
发生了什么
What happened?

491
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,808
我想有东西绊住了螺旋桨
I think there's something caught on the prop

492
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:07,419
呆这别动.
Stay put.

493
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:09,263
克里斯特尔, 把那裸男带上来
Crystal, get the sand rat up here

494
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:14,793
我说把那裸男带上来!  你有什么毛病?
I said get the fucking sand rat up here!  
What's wrong with you?

495
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:17,213
为什么你不自己叫他上来?
Why can't you go get him yourself?

496
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:30,154
我在想这么屎的一天全是你的错.
I'm just down here thinking how this 
whole fucked up day has been your fault.

497
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:32,689
你不帮我们搞定那个新妞, 
You wont help us with the new bitch, 

498
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:37,337
我让你做的你不做，还把我们带到这鬼地方!
you don't do a fucking thing 
I tell you and you take us way the fuck of course!

499
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:44,171
我明白, 你还是菜鸟. 我能接受...
I get it, you're new at this. I'm cool with that man...

500
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,240
但是你现在做的 ...
but what you're doing ...

501
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:48,624
什么 ...
what this is ...

502
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,680
有个形容词 ...
there's a word for it ...

503
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,541
什么呢?
It's a boat word, er what is it?

504
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,997
叛变! 是这样吗? 
Mutiny! Is that what this is? 

505
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,033
你要叛变吗?
Is it a mutiny?

506
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,682
放松 德里克? 有点过了
Relax Derek, ok? It's just getting a little wild

507
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:13,705
如果有谁在下面求救的话, 那会是你!
If anyone should be down there helping, it oughta be you!

508
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,776
让我来. 我来!
Let me do that. Let me do it!

509
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:19,926
让我来!
Let me do it!

510
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,560
这是紧急事件. 我要所有人都离开湖水!
This is an emergency. I need everyone out of the water now!

511
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,200
从水里上来! 这是紧急事件!
Get out of water now! This is an emergency!

512
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,058
从水里上来，现在!
Get out of the water now!

513
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:27,555
噢，该死!
Oh,shit!

514
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,560
上来! 上来!
Come on! Come on!

515
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,520
噢 天啊!
Oh my God!

516
00:55:27,878 --> 00:55:29,836
噢 天啊!
Oh my God!

517
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:49,883
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

518
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:53,070
你要干什么?
Where are you going?

519
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:55,643
给我一支枪! - 装满子弹了
Throw me a gun! - It's fully loaded

520
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:12,004
别松手.
Don't let go.

521
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,040
游到海滩! 从水里上来!
Swim to the beach! Get out of water!

522
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,449
从水里上来!
Get out of water!

523

525
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,240
别挡道!
Get the fuck out of the way!

526
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:03,645
别挡道!
Get the fuck out of the way!

527
00:58:58,525 --> 00:58:59,753
你会弄坏引擎的.
You're gonna kill the engine.

528
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:10,392
赞恩，劳拉, 抓住样东西，离玻璃远点.
Zane, Laura, hold on to something and get back from the glass.

529
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:14,919

你们还好吗?
Are you guys okay?

535
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,160
你还好吗? - 没事.
Are you okay? - Yes.

536
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,440
凯琳在哪儿?

Where is Kelly?  
- She is on the other side.

537
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,400
下面.
Down there.

538
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,880
凯琳! 凯琳!
Kelly! Kelly!

539
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,365
杰克!

01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:48,589
离开水!
Get out of the water!

541
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,465
我没办法过去.  
你从天窗里爬出来
I can't find a way to you.  
Get out through the skylite

542
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:54,270
快点!

543
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,342
杰克!
Jake!

544
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,806
你们不要看.
Come on. I don't want you to see this.

545
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,640
它们咬掉了我的JJ! 它们咬掉了我的JJ.
They took my penis! They took my penis.

546
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,158
它们咬掉了我的JJ.
They took my penis.

547
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,640
杰克，快点, 水越来越高了
Jake hurry up, the water's getting higher

548
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,160
杰克!

549
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,120
凯莉!

快点!
Hurry up!

551
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:14,311
你可以够到天窗吗?
Can you reach the skylite?

552
01:04:07,252 --> 01:04:09,247
粉碎你们这些混球!

01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:24,911
按住这个.
Hold this.

558
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,060
[电话铃响]
[phone ringing]

559
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,132
我是福里斯特警官.
This is Sheriff Forester.

560
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,243
妈? - 杰克.
Mum? - Jake.

561
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:33,815
对不起, 我搞砸了. 我们在湖上.
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

562
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,800
什么?
What?

563
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:36,888
劳拉和赞恩在哪儿?
Where are Laura and Zane?

564
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,040
他们也在船上，和我在一起.
They're with me on the boat.

565
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,480
天啊,杰克.
Oh my God, Jake.

566
01:05:40,382 --> 01:05:42,223
不管怎样, 别下水!
Whatever you do, do not go into the water!

567
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:45,180
你不知道, 妈妈. 我们的船在下沉.
You don't understand, Mum. Our boat is sinking.

568
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:51,283
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

569
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,472
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

570
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:09,903
我跟你一起去.
I'm coming with you.

571
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:11,092
我们走.
Let's go.

572
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,011
是妈妈.
That's mum.

573
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,400
妈妈! 嘿!
Mum! Hey!

574
01:06:38,926 --> 01:06:40,575
杰克的船.
Jack's boat.

575
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:43,033
我们怎么让船靠近? - 我不知道.
How are we gonna get the boat close? - I don't know.

576
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:48,023
绳. 你认为可以够到吗?
The rope. Do you think it will reach?

577
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,516
杰克, 我扔绳给你.   
我要你把绳系在最高的栏杆上.
Jake, I'm gonna throw you the rope.   
I want you to tie it to the highest railing

578
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,480
好的.
Okay, Mum.

579
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,480
打结了? - 是的.
Tied? - Yeah.

580
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,560
往后退点.
Back up a bit.

581
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:04,222
当心礁石.
Watch out for rocks.

582
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,520
当心!
Watch out!

583
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:08,868
准备好了? - 是的.
Ready? - Yeah.

584
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:13,934
很好.呆在那儿别动.
That's good.Stay at what you are far.

585
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,920
拿到了.
Yeah.

586
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:32,054
保持绳紧绷. 我拿上对讲机了
Keep it tight. I've got my radio

587
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:34,857
径直过去.
Just get there.

588
01:07:50,828 --> 01:07:51,863
妈妈, 你好吗?
Mum, are you okay?

589
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:58,274
大家都在船上了吗?
Is this everybody on the boat?

590
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:01,767
没有, 凯莉被困在船舱里.  
我们没办法救她出来.
No, Kelly is stuck down in the cabin.  
We can't get her out.

591
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,341
没办法救她出来. - 凯莉?
We can't get her out. - Kelly?

592
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,560
天啊! 凯莉?
God! Kelly?

593
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:11,058
你可以抓住我的手臂吗?
Can you grab my arm?

594
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,560
帮我离开这里. 水越来越高了!
Help me get out of here. Water is getting higher!

595
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:16,661
- 你可以够到天窗吗?  
这没用. 天窗卡住了!
- Can you reach the skylite?  
It doesn't matter. It's fucking stuck!

596
01:08:21,846 --> 01:08:23,073
杰克!
Jake!

597
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,000
我很害怕!
I'm scared!

598
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,146

01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,560
妈妈, 快点! - 凯莉?
Mum, hurry! - Kelly?

600
01:08:31,136 --> 01:08:33,093
- 我们会死的. 我们不会死的, 明白吗?
- Were gonna die. We are not gonna die, OK?

601
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,000
我需要帮助! 救命!
I need your help! Please!

602
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:47,027
这是到船下面唯一的通道.
It's the only way to reach it under the ship.

603
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,920
拿上绳子.
Get the rope.

604
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,944
你说什么? 我们不能就这样把她留在这儿.
What are you talking about? We can't leave her down there.

605
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:54,474
我把大家都送过绳锁后, 我会回来救她的.
Once I get everyone cross the rope, I'm goona come back for her.

606
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:56,702
不,我不会丢下她!
No,I'm not leaving without her mum!

607
01:08:56,857 --> 01:09:00,003
天, 杰克! 能到她那边的唯一的通道在水下
Jesus, Jake! The only way to get to her is for you to get into the water

608
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,460
我不会让你这么做!
I'm not gonna let you do that!

609
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:05,032
她是因为我才上了这艘船
The reason she came on this boat was coz of me

610
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:06,837
是我的错.
That's my fault.

611
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:11,712
我不会丢下她.
I'm not going without her.

612
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:14,208
- 支撑不了多久了. 我们走!
- This isn't gonna hold much longer. Let's go!

613
01:09:16,204 --> 01:09:18,276
我让赞恩和劳拉过绳索然后我回来,
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and when I come back,

614
01:09:19,506 --> 01:09:20,848
我们一起就她.
we are gonna do it together.

615
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,920
好的.
Alright.

616
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:25,992
我们让两个孩子在我们中间, 你先走.
We're gonna keep the 2 little ones between us, you go first.

617
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:31,021
你行吗?   
- 相信我! 我可是会钢管舞的!
Can you do this?   
- You better believe it! I don't pole dance for nothing!

618
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:36,779
你回头要向我好好解释这一切.
You have a lot of explaining to do.

619
01:09:39,353 --> 01:09:40,849
准备好了吗?
Ready?

620
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:49,755
当心, 别往下看. 快.
Be careful, don't look down. Let's go.

621
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,560
就当成是在操场,
Just like at the playground guys,

622
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,520
... 慢慢来
... hand over hand

623
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:05,033
别往下看.
Don't look down.

624
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,040
别往下看.
Don't look down, alright.

625
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,680
你能行的.
Come on, you can do this.

626
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,160
别往下看.
Don't look down.

627
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,720
滚开!
GET OFF ME!

628
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,360
不要! 不要!
No! No!

629
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,080
妈的!
Godammit!

630
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,217
劳拉, 听我说!
Laura, listen to me!

631
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,320
如果你动作快点, 它不会抓到你的.
If you move fast, it will not get you.

632
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,280
你得现在就要移动!
You have to move now!

633
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:16,667
快!
Come on!

634
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,162
移动!
Do it!

635
01:11:29,068 --> 01:11:30,026
好的，你们到了.
OK guys, you're here.

636
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:35,440
你成功了.
You did it.

637
01:11:41,314 --> 01:11:42,503
该死!
Damn it!

638
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,400
继续移动!
Let's go, keep moving!

639
01:11:53,983 --> 01:11:54,711
你还好吧?
Are you ok?

640
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:56,092
关掉引擎.
Cut the engine.

641
01:11:57,744 --> 01:11:58,510
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

642
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:01,352
杰克, 你在干什么?
Jake, what are you doing?

643
01:12:04,078 --> 01:12:05,190
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

644
01:12:05,692 --> 01:12:06,458
杰克!
Jake!

645
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:07,992
杰克, 不要!
Jake, do not!

646
01:12:08,186 --> 01:12:09,720
他们想要血, 是吗?
They want blood, don't they?

647
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,256
好, 我就给他们.
Well, we'll give them.

648
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:26,649
湿衬衫, 湿衬衫.
Wet T-shirt, wet t-shirt.

649
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:45,309
杰克!
Jake!

650
01:13:46,653 --> 01:13:47,880
天啊! 天啊!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

651
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:52,180
我们要离开这里. 我们一起离开!
We're gonna get out of here. Both of us!

652
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:58,323
- 我进来了! 我要你们要以最快的速度拉我们出去! 
明白吗?
- I'm in! I need you guys to pull us out as fast as possible!  
Do you copy?

653
01:13:58,515 --> 01:13:59,972
- 好的, 我们准备好了.
- Ok, we're ready when you are.

654
01:14:06,231 --> 01:14:07,996
杰克, 你要干什么? 他们会回来的.
Jake, what are you doing? They're gonna come back.

655
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,875
我给它们些小吃. 至少能拖延一下它们
I gave them a snack. That's gonna hold them off for a while at least

656
01:14:17,212 --> 01:14:18,668
我要你把这些东西绑起来，明白吗? - 为什么?
I need you to tie these together ok? - Why?

657
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,920
尽管做就是了!
Just do it!

658
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:22,123
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

659
01:14:23,353 --> 01:14:25,233
杰克!
Jake!

660
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:44,005
你可以抓牢吗?
Can you hold it tight?

661
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:50,071
屏住呼吸, 我们游到船的底部.
Hold your breath, we'll swim to the bottom of the boat.

662
01:14:50,878 --> 01:14:53,142
我要你紧紧抱着. 你可以紧紧抱着我吗?
I need you to hold on tight. Can you hold on tight to me?
