1
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:39,375
This man is worth $500,

2
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,876
and this man's going to collect.

3
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,417
He's Jake Cahill,

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,209
and he lives by...

5
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,209
Bounty Law.

6
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,959
You don't ever bring them in alive, do you, Jake?

7
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,709
Not when there's three of them and one of me.

8
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,751
What are you looking at, bounty killer?

9
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:02,375
I'm looking at an ugly owl-hoot
about to get his jaw busted.

10
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:05,000
Amateurs try and take men in alive.

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,417
- Amateurs usually don't make it.
- Whether you're dead or alive,

12
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,918
you're just a dollar sign to Jake Cahill on Bounty Law.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,042
Thursdays at 8:30, only on NBC.

14
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:22,959
Hello, everybody.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:29,083
This is Allen Kincade on the set of the exciting hit NBC
and Screen Gems television series Bounty Law.

16
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:32,209
Now, if you think you're seeing double,
don't adjust your television sets

17
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,584
because, well, in a way, you are.

18
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,959
To my right is Bounty Law series lead
and Jake Cahill himself, Rick Dalton.

19
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,792
And to my left is Rick's stunt double, Cliff Booth.

20
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:44,751
Welcome, gentlemen,
and thanks for taking the time to visit with us.

21
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,167
Well, it's our pleasure, Allen.

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,542
So, Rick, explain to the audience
exactly what it is a stunt double does.

23
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,959
Well...

24
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:56,125
actors are required to do a lot of dangerous stuff.

25
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,209
Say Jake Cahill gets shot off his horse.

26
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,542
Now, can I fall off a horse?

27
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:04,167
Yes, I can, and, yes, I have.

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,876
But say I fall off wrong and I sprain my wrist
or I twist my ankle.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Now, that can put an undue burden on production
because now maybe I can't work for a week.

30
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:20,334
So Cliff here is meant to help carry the load.

31
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,834
Is that how you'd describe your job, Cliff?

32
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,500
What, carrying his load?

33
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,125
Yeah, that's about right.

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,834
Join me next week on the set of
The Dick Van Dyke Show,

35
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:36,459
where I'll be talking to those comical cutups,
Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.

36
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:40,083
Till then,
this is Allen Kincade signing off from Hollywood.

37
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,792
I missed you.

38
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:06,334
- The black one. And the flowers.
- Flowers, Ava, flowers.

39
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:09,250
- And there's the small one.
- Can I see your tickets?

40
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,292
Oh, good boy.

41
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,876
Gina, Gina, Gina.

42
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,667
The face in the misty light.

43
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:18,751
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

44
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,876
I... I have a meeting with a very handsome cowboy man.

45
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,334
He's waiting for you in the bar.

46
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,250
Well...

47
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:32,417
since I just finished watching
a Rick Dalton fucking film festival,

48
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,209
I think I know who you are. Put it there.

49
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,792
Well, it's my pleasure, Mr. Schwartz.

50
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:41,959
- And thank you for taking an interest.
- Schwarz, not Schwartz.

51
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,334
Goddamn it to hell. I'm sorry about that.

52
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:47,542
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

53
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,250
Marvin, call me Rick.

54
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,167
- Rick?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,792
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

56
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,792
No, that's my stunt double, Cliff Booth.

57
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,334
- Yeah.
- Good to meet you.

58
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,500
We've worked together
since the last two seasons of Bounty Law.

59
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:02,167
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop, so he gave me a ride.

60
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,751
That's a big fucking lie.

61
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,417
Rick got his driver's license taken away
for too many drunk-driving tickets.

62
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,751
- Cliff drives him everywhere now.
- Oh, fuck.

63
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,792
- Well, sounds like a good friend.
- I try.

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,709
I wanna send you greetings from my wife,
Mary Alice Schwarz.

65
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,417
Oh, well, that's nice.

66
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,042
Thanks a lot.

67
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,626
We had a Rick Dalton double feature
in our screening room last night.

68
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,667
Oh, well, that's both flattering and embarrassing.

69
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:37,667
What'd you see?

70
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:43,083
Thirty-five mm prints of Tanner
and The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

71
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,542
I hope the Rick Dalton double feature

72
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,792
wasn't too painful for you and the-- And the missus.

73
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:59,918
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop. What are you saying?

74
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,125
Mary Alice loves Westerns.
Our Whole courtship, we watched Westerns.

75
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,834
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

76
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,125
And we thoroughly enjoyed Tanner.

77
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:12,792
- Oh, that's nice.
- It's really good. And anyway, she goes to bed.

78
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,959
I open up a box of Havanas.

79
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:21,500
I light up, I pour myself a cognac and I watch...

80
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,542
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

81
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:26,792
What a picture.

82
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,667
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

83
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,584
That is so much fun.

84
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,751
All the shooting.

85
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,500
- I love that stuff. You know, the killing.
- A lot of killing. Lot of killing, yeah.

86
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,334
Now, gentlemen, the plan is, we reverse our forces

87
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,042
and drive the Allies back into the sea!

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,042
- Genius.
- Panzer divisions come in,

89
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,918
and we drive them here to the ocean.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,417
They'll be up against the wall.

91
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

92
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,083
This is the spot...

93
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:02,709
Hermann!

94
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,417
Open the curtains.

95
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,209
Anybody order fried sauerkraut?

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,751
Burn, you Nazi bastards!

97
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:53,542
That's you operating the flamethrower, isn't it?

98
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,584
Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was. Yeah, yeah.

99
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,500
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

100
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:02,083
that's one shit-fuck crazy weapon
you do not wanna be on the wrong side of.

101
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,292
Boy, oh, boy.

102
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,334
You know, I practiced with that dragon

103
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,334
three hours a day for two weeks.

104
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,876
Not just because I wanted to look good
in the picture, but because I was--

105
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,083
I was shit-scared of the damn thing, to be honest.

106
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,626
Mike fucking Lewis!

107
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,292
Crisping them Nazis to hell!

108
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,959
Oh, shit, that's...

109
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,542
All right, that's too hot.

110
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,751
Anything we can
do about that heat?

111
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:26,500
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,918
So I came to the office early today,

113
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:35,500
and I watched two episodes of Bounty Law on 16 mm.

114
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,459
Jody Janice,

115
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:42,709
wanted for cattle rustling in the state of Wyoming,
$425 dead or alive.

116
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,751
And you brought him here to collect.

117
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,500
I don't even know where here is.

118
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,709
It was just the closest place.

119
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,626
Caught up with him about five miles outside of town.

120
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,167
So, bounty killer,

121
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,542
the name of this town is Janicetown.

122
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,250
And that boy you killed...

123
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,125
was Jody Janice.

124
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:11,834
He was the baby boy of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

125
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:17,751
Who's Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

126
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:23,292
Well, I'll be sure and introduce you

127
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,626
when he gets here.

128
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,584
Bounty Law.

129
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,375
Starring Rick Dalton.

130
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:58,834
Then a couple of the jokers over in archival sent over
a kinescope of a little treat featuring you.

131
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,167
There's an old piano

132
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,876
And they play it hot
Behind the green door

133
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,918
Don't know what they're doing

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,626
But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door

135
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,584
Wish they'd let me in

136
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:18,459
So I can find out
What's behind the green door

137
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:24,083
So you've been doing guest shots

138
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,876
on episodic TV shows the last couple of years?

139
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,834
Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot for CBS right now.

140
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,417
It's called-- It's called Lancer. I play the heavy.

141
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,042
Did a Ron Ely Tarzan.

142
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,083
I did a Land of the Giants. Green Hornet.

143
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,083
I did that show...

144
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,500
Bingo Martin with that kid Scott Brown. Yeah.

145
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:49,876
And I got a F.B.I. that airs this Sunday.

146
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,417
You... You always play the bad guy on these shows?

147
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,417
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

148
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,334
So, and they have a fight scene at the end of them?

149
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,500
Well, not-- Not-- Not Land of the Giants or F.B.I.,

150
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,542
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

151
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,375
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm-- I'm the heavy.

152
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:14,667
Oh, that's an old trick pulled by the networks.

153
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:18,292
Now, you take Bingo Martin, for example. Right?

154
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,834
So you got a new guy like Scott Brown.

155
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,459
You wanna build up his bona fides, right?

156
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:28,459
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show to play the heavy.

157
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,709
Then at the end of the show, when they fight,

158
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,667
it's hero besting heavy.

159
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:36,292
But what the audience sees

160
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:41,375
is Bingo Martin whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

161
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,500
You see?

162
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,375
Then next week, it's Ron Ely.

163
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,834
And next week, it's Bob Conrad,

164
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,918
wearing his tight pants, kicking your ass.

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,834
Yeah.

166
00:12:55,375 --> 00:13:01,167
In another couple of years, playing punching bag
to every swinging dick new to the network,

167
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,834
that's gonna have a psychological effect
on how the audience perceives you.

168
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,417
Right.

169
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,375
So, Rick,

170
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:13,292
who's gonna kick the shit out of you next week?

171
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,375
Mannix? The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

172
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,417
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

173
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,000
How about Batman and Robin?

174
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,792
Down goes you.

175
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,876
Down goes your career as a leading man.

176
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:38,292
Or do you go to Rome and star in Westerns

177
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,626
and win fucking fights?

178
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:49,751
Ticket, señor?

179
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,959
- All right, what's the matter, partner?
- Well...

180
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,542
it's official, old buddy.

181
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:07,626
- I'm a has-been.
- What are you talking about?

182
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,042
- What did that guy tell you?
- He told me the goddamn truth, is what he told me.

183
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:16,584
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

184
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,500
- I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that.
- Here. Put these on.

185
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,709
- Don't cry in front of the Mexicans.
- Son of a bitch.

186
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,959
Now, what's got you so upset, man?

187
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:29,209
If coming face-to-face with the failure
that is your career ain't worth crying about,

188
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:33,334
- then I don't know what the fuck is.
- Right. That guy in there turn you down?

189
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:37,250
No. He wants to help me get into Italian movies.

190
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,083
- Then what's the problem?
- I gotta do Italian goddamn movies!

191
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,918
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,209
Fucking bullshit!
It doesn't matter whether I cry in public.

193
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,626
Nobody remembers who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

194
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,876
...at the Hall of Justice in town.
The defense will try to prove the killing

195
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,042
- of Kennedy was the product of a sick mind.
- Fuck!

196
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,500
- Thank you. Hey, let's go.
- Take me home, Cliff.

197
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,250
Come on, take me home.

198
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,375
...as early as next Wednesday.

199
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:06,542
More than 1000 Communists dead are reported
in new, large-scale fighting in South Vietnam.

200
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:07,959
U. S. losses are said to be...

201
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,459
That's swell, man.

202
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,834
Fucking hippie motherfuckers.

203
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,125
...and bases with rockets and mortar fire.

204
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:20,167
As President Nixon was flying to Europe,
he received details of that fighting by radio.

205
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,042
Always is always forever

206
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,667
As long as one is one

207
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,751
inside yourself for your father

208
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,959
All is one, all is one, all is one

209
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,626
It's time we put our love behind you

210
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:39,834
The illusion has been just a dream

211
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:42,876
The Valley of Death and I'll find you

212
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,584
Now is when on a sunshine beam

213
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,042
Hot dog buns!

214
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,417
For sure they shall surely see

215
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,584
No clothing, no tears, no hunger

216
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,459
You shall see, you shall see, you shall see

217
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,375
Always is always forever

218
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,709
As long as one is one

219
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,459
inside yourself for your father

220
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,500
All is one, all is one, all is one

221
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,542
Five years of ascent.

222
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:16,042
Ten years of treading water.

223
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,417
And now a race to the bottom.

224
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:22,542
Look, I never had much of a career to speak of,

225
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:25,876
so I can't say I really know how you feel.

226
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,125
What are you talking about?

227
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:28,292
You're my stunt double.

228
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,918
Come on, now. Shit.

229
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,417
Rick, I'm your driver, man. I'm your gofer.

230
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,751
I'm not complaining, man.

231
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,083
I like driving you around.

232
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,834
I like doing shit around the house

233
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,709
and house-sitting
in the Hollywood Hills when you're gone.

234
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,876
But I haven't been
a full-time stuntman for a while now,

235
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,000
and from where I'm standing,
going to Rome to star in movies does not sound

236
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,626
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

237
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:57,167
Come on, now.
You ever seen an Italian Western, huh?

238
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,375
They're awful. It's a fucking farce.

239
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,042
Yeah, how many you seen? One? Two?

240
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,167
I've seen enough, all right?

241
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,542
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

242
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,667
Oh, hell, man, stay in L.A.
Give it what fer next pilot season.

243
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,918
Nah, nah. I'm-- I'm--

244
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,167
I'm too insecure now to score come pilot season.

245
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,125
Besides, Screen Gems ain't gonna
have nothing good to say about me.

246
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,500
- You know that.
- Shit. You made Bounty Law.

247
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:20,042
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season. No matter what I do,

248
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,709
I'm always gonna be the horse's ass
that got Bounty Law canceled

249
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:27,417
because I wanted some
fucking rinky-dink movie career.

250
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,375
Tom. My friend.

251
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,292
- I met him?
- No, you haven't met him.

252
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,667
You won't meet him because
I don't think you'd like him.

253
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,500
Why?

254
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,083
Well...

255
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,834
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

256
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,959
Holy shit.

257
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,542
That was Polanski.

258
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,167
That was Roman Polanski.

259
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,375
He's lived there
for a month now.

260
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,042
First time I seen him.

261
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,167
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

262
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:16,209
What do I always say?
Most important thing in this town is,

263
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,667
when you're making money, you buy a house in town.

264
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,417
You don't rent. Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

265
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,626
Hollywood real estate means you live here.

266
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:27,125
You're not just visiting, not just passing through.

267
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,292
You fucking live here.

268
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,167
Here I am flat on my ass,
and who I got living next door to me?

269
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,375
The director of Rosemary's fucking Baby, that's who.

270
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:39,667
Polanski, the hottest director in town right now,
probably the world.

271
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,083
He's my next-door fucking neighbor.

272
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,125
I mean, shit.
I mean, who knows what could happen?

273
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:49,876
I could-- I could be one pool party away
from starring in a new Polanski movie.

274
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:53,250
- So you're feeling better now?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry about all that.

275
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:57,125
- Give me my glasses back.
- Oh, come get them, fucker. Come--

276
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,459
All right, all right, Audie Murphy, relax.

277
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,959
- There you go.
- You gonna need me for anything else?

278
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,959
Nah, nah, nah.
I got a lot of lines to learn for tomorrow.

279
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,250
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

280
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,334
- I'm gonna get my carcass on home.
- All right.

281
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,626
- All right, 7:15 AM.
- Seven-fifteen.

282
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,500
- Out the door.
- Out the door.

283
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:14,792
- In the car.
- All right, see you then.

284
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,584
Hello, coming in. Hello.

285
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,709
Hello, darling. Hello.

286
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,667
Come here.

287
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:17,334
Hello, sweetheart.

288
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:19,876
How was your day?

289
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,167
Wait till you see what I got for you.

290
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,667
Wait until you see what I got for you.

291
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,709
Look what I got for you.

292
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,709
Gonna blow your mind, man.

293
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,834
Come here. Come here.

294
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,667
Was that a whine?

295
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,167
What did I tell
you about whining?

296
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,667
You whine, you don't eat.

297
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,417
I will throw this
shit in the trash.

298
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,834
I don't wanna, but I will.

299
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:53,125
You understand?

300
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,125
All right.

301
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,626
I waited at the bar till closing time,
but he never came back.

302
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,959
Okay, Peggy, what happened?

303
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,667
I don't know. Everything was fine.

304
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:43,292
We had dinner at my house.

305
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,209
And afterwards, you know,
while I was doing the dishes,

306
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:48,542
he and Tobey played.

307
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:51,459
And then, at the club, Gabe was doing great.

308
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,709
Then, wham, a sudden change.

309
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:55,876
You know how musicians are.

310
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,083
They're temperamental cats.

311
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,250
- Who knows what got into him?
- Yeah.

312
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,667
Rick Dalton rehearsal tape starting in five, four,

313
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,375
three, two, one.

314
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:16,792
Pepe, get your behind behind that bar! I got a guest.

315
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,375
Johnny says...

316
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,375
Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.

317
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:24,125
- How's the beans?
- I've had worse.

318
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,292
Johnny says... Spanish.

319
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,918
A toast.

320
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,417
To my wife and all my sweethearts.

321
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,292
May they never meet.

322
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:39,500
Señor Madrid, care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?

323
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,959
I would be delighted, Monsieur Dakota.

324
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:46,751
Take the bottle with you.

325
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,542
And Pepe comes over.

326
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,918
Hey, where's that chili pepper daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

327
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:56,375
She's asleep.

328
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,834
Well, wake her the heck up, get her down here
with her fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guests.

329
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:05,584
Sí, señor,
but please don't hurt her this time, I beg you.

330
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,042
I ain't gonna hurt her.

331
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,167
Just want her to play the fiddle.

332
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,959
Fetch her and tell her I'll
give her a fat $5 gold piece,

333
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:14,083
she play her little chili pepper heart out.

334
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,584
So, Johnny, what else you heard about me?

335
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:23,083
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,
but Lancer has money.

336
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:27,083
At some point,
he's gonna hire some guns and push back.

337
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,250
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

338
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:33,542
I'll open the door for you.

339
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:34,751
You look good.

340
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,000
- I think Steve's gonna be there too.
- Oh, yeah.

341
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,083
Oh, look. They're here.

342
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,292
Welcome to Playboy Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

343
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,417
Hey, how are you doing, baby?

344
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,000
Hey! How are you?

345
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,042
Oh, Cass!

346
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,250
Yeah!

347
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, baby!

348
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,542
Yeah!

349
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,042
Oh, yeah.

350
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm gonna tell you a story.

351
00:30:57,918 --> 00:31:00,709
She was engaged to him.

352
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:08,918
Then she flew to the UK...

353
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,250
to make a film with him,

354
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:17,292
and broke off her engagement with him and married him.

355
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:23,042
Then they moved to Los Angeles,

356
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:26,834
and the three of them have been inseparable.

357
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:28,959
Really?

358
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,250
What's up?

359
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,751
Jay loves Sharon, that's what's up.

360
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,083
And he knows...

361
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:44,083
as sure as God made little green apples...

362
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,000
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's gonna fuck things up,

363
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:52,792
and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.

364
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,167
Well, one thing's for sure.

365
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,959
Yeah?

366
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,292
What's that?

367
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,292
Sharon absolutely has a type.

368
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,292
Cute, short,
talented guys who look like 12-year-old boys.

369
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,375
Yeah.

370
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:15,584
I never stood a chance.

371
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,000
Fuck you, Dr. Sapirstein.

372
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,542
Oh, here we are.

373
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,542
Tell transpo! Gonna need to move all that out!

374
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:52,125
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

375
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:53,042
Go ahead.

376
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,500
- Maybe you can talk to him.
- Just talk to him.

377
00:33:58,584 --> 00:33:59,918
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

378
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,417
I think the wind blew down my TV antenna last night,

379
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,918
so while I piss-fart around with wardrobe,
you mind going home and fixing it?

380
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,751
I can.

381
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:12,083
Can you talk to the stunt gaffer about me today?

382
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:15,167
- That way I'll know if I'm working this week or not.
- Yeah.

383
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,667
I've been meaning to tell you.

384
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:20,918
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

385
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,459
the gaffer from The Green Hornet,
so there really ain't no point.

386
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,500
Well, if you don't need me, I'll pick you up at wrap.

387
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:29,834
I don't need you. Not today.

388
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,000
Go home, fix my antenna, do whatever.

389
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,125
See you at wrap.

390
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,250
Hey!

391
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,834
You're Rick fucking Dalton. Don't you forget it.

392
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,083
Hey, hey.

393
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:56,334
Hey, buddy, I'm Rick Dalton.
You know where I'm supposed to go?

394
00:34:56,417 --> 00:35:00,292
- They're waiting for you in the makeup trailer.
- Where's the makeup trailer?

395
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,500
Straight back the way you came, hard right.

396
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,876
Oh, my God.

397
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,709
Rick Dalton.

398
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,083
Sam Wanamaker.

399
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,959
Hey, Sam. Sorry about the wet hand.

400
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,292
Oh, don't worry about it.

401
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,626
I'm used to it with Yul.

402
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:28,292
I just want you to know, I'm the one who cast you,
and I could not be more delighted you're doing this.

403
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:32,167
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.
I-- I appreciate it. It's a good part.

404
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,959
Yeah, it is.

405
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,167
Have you met Jim Stacy, the series lead?

406
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:39,500
- Not yet, no. No.
- Well, you guys are going to be dynamite together.

407
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, it sounds exciting.

408
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,167
Yeah, lightning in a bottle.

409
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,334
- Now, you met Sonya, makeup and hair?
- Hi.

410
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:52,375
- And this is Rebekka, who does costumes.
- Hello.

411
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:53,292
- Hi.
- Howdy.

412
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,375
I want a whole new look for Caleb.

413
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:58,584
I don't want this Western costumed
the way they costumed The Big Valley

414
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,959
and Bonanza for the last decade.

415
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,667
I want a zeitgeist flair to the costumes.

416
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:11,083
I mean, nothing anachronistic,
but where does 1869 and 1969 meet?

417
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:14,709
Especially when it comes to you, Caleb.

418
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:17,083
First off, I want to give him a mustache.

419
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:21,918
A big, droopy, Zapata-like mustache.

420
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,042
Now, about his jacket.

421
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,042
I want to give him a hippie jacket.

422
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,292
Something he could wear into the London Fog tonight

423
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,292
- and look like the hippest guy in the room.
- Far out.

424
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,542
We got a Custer jacket. Fringes all down the arm.

425
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:39,542
It's tan now, but I dye it dark brown,
he could hit the Strip in it tonight.

426
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:41,667
That's my girl.

427
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:44,667
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

428
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:47,250
I want to go with a different hairstyle.

429
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:50,500
- What?
- Something more hippie-ish.

430
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,876
You-- You-- You-- You want me to look like a hippie?

431
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:57,000
Well, think less hippie, more...

432
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,500
Hells Angel!

433
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,709
- Right. Say, Sam--
- Get me the--

434
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:03,834
Sam. Sam...

435
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,626
if you got me covered up in all this...

436
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:11,959
This junk, how's the audience gonna know it's me?

437
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,167
I hope they don't.

438
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't want them to see Jake Cahill.

439
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,876
I want them to see Caleb.

440
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:25,876
I hired you to be an actor, Rick.

441
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:29,167
Not a TV cowboy. You're better than that.

442
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:44,542
I've been meaning to tell you,
the guy who gaffs this,

443
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:47,709
he's best friends with Randy,
the gaffer from The Green Hornet,

444
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,918
so there really ain't no point.

445
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:06,751
Hey, Randy.

446
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:09,918
Cliff.

447
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,500
- So you're still with Rick, huh?
- Still here.

448
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:18,292
- He in there?
- Yeah. Just knock.

449
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,250
Look, just put him in the wardrobe, all right?

450
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:29,209
What's it gonna hurt?
Then if you need him, you got him, all right?

451
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:32,792
But then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,

452
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:34,167
and, man, she's a fucking bitch.

453
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,375
I just don't-- Please, I--

454
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,459
Look, Randy, I'm asking you to help me out, man.

455
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:42,918
If the answer's no,
the answer's no, not no with excuses.

456
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,834
Hey, man.

457
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:48,792
This ain't a fucking Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

458
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:51,375
I can't afford to hire
a bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes

459
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:55,250
and sit around talking to each other all day
on the chance that I might use them.

460
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,876
I got a four-man team here, Rick.

461
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:59,375
If I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

462
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:01,959
And, you know, I gotta look after my dudes.

463
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:05,000
Hey, and if your dudes were a better match for me,

464
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:09,250
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"
but that's not the case, and you know it.

465
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:11,334
- He's a great fucking match for me.
- Yeah, no...

466
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:15,792
Hey, you could do anything you want to him.
Shit, throw him off a building, right?

467
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:16,751
Light him on fire.

468
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,751
Hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right?

469
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:22,209
Get creative. Do whatever you want.
He's just happy for the opportunity.

470
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,751
- Rick.
- Yeah?

471
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:27,751
I don't dig him.

472
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,417
And I don't dig the vibe he brings on a set.

473
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,167
What, is there some old beef between the two of you?

474
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,584
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

475
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,918
The dude killed his fucking wife.

476
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:46,209
Come on, man.
You don't believe that old shit, do you?

477
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:47,959
Yes, Rick, I do.

478
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:51,292
And I work with my wife, and she believes it.

479
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,417
She doesn't want his creepy ass around.

480
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:59,626
You know,
this is probably the shittiest weather ever.

481
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:04,918
The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat
with the shittiest person.

482
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,792
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser. He's a loser."

483
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:13,250
They all said it, "He's a fucking loser,"
and I didn't believe them.

484
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:15,167
So I guess I'm the fucking idiot.

485
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,083
And now you're not gonna talk to me?

486
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,500
What, you don't feel like fighting?

487
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:22,250
Well, I feel like fucking fighting

488
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:28,209
because I've been up here by myself
for four hours on this fucking shithole of a boat.

489
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:29,417
Yeah.

490
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:35,292
He's a goddamn war hero. Fuck.

491
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:38,834
Yeah, appreciate it.

492
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:47,375
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

493
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:55,459
Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,
but you don't stunt, I don't pay you.

494
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,250
Appreciate the opportunity, Randy.

495
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,500
I won't let you down.

496
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:02,792
- You know my wife Janet, don't you?
- Yeah.

497
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,083
Steer clear of her.

498
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:08,500
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

499
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:13,209
What I admire is, in his sport,
there's an element of true combat.

500
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:18,250
When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the ring,
that's not two athletes posturing.

501
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:20,250
That's combat.

502
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:23,542
Two men trying to kill each other right now.

503
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:24,792
If you don't beat him...

504
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,000
he kills you.

505
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,626
That's beyond athletics.

506
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,334
That's beyond Wide World of Sports, you know?

507
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:35,584
That's two warriors engaged in combat.

508
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:37,000
That's what I admire.

509
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,167
In martial arts tournaments,

510
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,709
they won't let you fight like that.

511
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:43,209
It's very frustrating.

512
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:46,334
You stand in front of a guy,
and you just wanna let him have it.

513
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,250
But you can't.

514
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:53,334
So you gotta do this playacting, patty-cake version.

515
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:56,584
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston. Joe Louis.

516
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:59,334
The colored boxer,
not that white kickboxing asshole.

517
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,709
They do what they need to do to win.

518
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:08,209
They unleash as much punishment as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

519
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:13,542
But in martial arts tournaments,
I do to win what they do to win.

520
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:16,042
I unleash all my power.

521
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,667
I kill people.

522
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,083
If you fought Cassius Clay, who would win?

523
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,918
Well, that would never happen.

524
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,626
But if you did, what do you think would happen?

525
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,167
I'd make him a cripple.

526
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:35,250
Hey, you. What's your name?

527
00:45:35,334 --> 00:45:37,125
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

528
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,626
My name's Cliff.

529
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:42,751
I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

530
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:45,626
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

531
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,083
You know, you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

532
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,000
That's what they tell me.

533
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:53,334
So did I say something funny, stuntman?

534
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,417
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

535
00:45:57,459 --> 00:45:59,250
Look, I don't want any trouble.

536
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:00,876
I'm just here to do a job.

537
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,417
But you're laughing at what I'm saying.
But I'm not saying anything funny.

538
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,250
So, what do you think is so funny?

539
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,626
What I think is...

540
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:15,334
you're a little man with a big mouth and a big chip,

541
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,083
and I think you should be embarrassed

542
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:22,083
to suggest you'd be anything more than a stain
on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks.

543
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:25,250
Brother, you're the one with the big mouth.

544
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:29,959
And I would really enjoy closing it,
especially in front of all my friends.

545
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:33,417
But my hands are registered as lethal weapons.

546
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:39,876
That means, we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you, I go to jail.

547
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:42,959
Anybody accidentally kills anybody in a fight,
they go to jail.

548
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:46,584
It's called manslaughter.
And I think all that "lethal weapon" horseshit

549
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:50,209
is just an excuse
so you dancers never have to get in a real fight.

550
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:52,834
Okay.

551
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:55,959
How about a friendly contest?

552
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,042
No punching in the face.

553
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,709
Two out of three.

554
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,834
Who puts who on the ground first?

555
00:47:02,918 --> 00:47:04,918
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,

556
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,209
just who ends up on their butt?

557
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,500
That's a great Idea, Kato.

558
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,375
- You know, Bruce, that guy's kind of famous.
- That guy?

559
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:30,876
For what?

560
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:33,375
Killed his wife and got away with it.

561
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:34,626
That guy?

562
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:35,792
That guy.

563
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:02,292
Not bad, Kato.

564
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,751
Try that again.

565
00:48:48,876 --> 00:48:51,250
What the fuck is going on here?

566
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:55,584
Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.
What the fuck are you thinking?

567
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,918
You're right, Janet. I'm sorry about that.

568
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,667
Don't fucking "Janet" me, you prick.

569
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:03,000
Hey. What's up, babe?

570
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:06,459
What's up, Randy, is that your loser asshole,

571
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:10,375
wife-killing buddy boy here was beating
the shit out of Bruce.

572
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:11,334
What?

573
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,459
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

574
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:15,334
What the fuck, man?

575
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:19,209
Let me just say, nobody beat the shit out of Bruce.

576
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,500
It was a friendly contest. He barely touched me.

577
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,959
I think that dent in the car says something different.

578
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:27,876
Oh, my God!

579
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:30,417
What the fuck did you do to my car?

580
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,667
What the fuck did you do to her car?

581
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,959
I threw this little prick into it,

582
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:36,834
but I did not know it was her car.

583
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:41,417
Get the wardrobe off, get your shit, and get fucked!

584
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,542
- Janet!
- What?

585
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:45,626
- I will handle this.
- Then fucking handle it, Randy.

586
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:47,834
Cliff...

587
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:54,083
get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get off the lot.

588
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,626
Fair enough.

589
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,542
What's the matter?

590
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:41,626
Are you afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you were dancing
to Paul Revere and the Raiders?

591
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,667
Are they not cool enough for you?

592
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,042
Who's this shaggy asshole?

593
00:50:57,542 --> 00:50:58,751
Hello? Can I help you?

594
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:01,584
Oh, yeah. Hey, man. I'm looking for Terry.

595
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:04,792
I'm a friend of Terry's and Dennis Wilson's.

596
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:08,709
Well, Terry and Candy don't live here anymore.
This is the Polanski residence now.

597
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,626
Really? He moved?

598
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:12,792
Dang.

599
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:15,959
You know--? You know where?

600
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:20,125
I'm not sure, really, but the owner of the property,
Paul, might. He's in the guest house.

601
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:22,959
Who is it, Jay?

602
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:25,751
It's okay, honey. It's a friend of Terry's.

603
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,042
- Yeah, just take the back path.
- Thank you kindly.

604
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:32,959
Ma'am.

605
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:51,626
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

606
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:53,209
I know they just broke for lunch,

607
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:56,042
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

608
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:59,000
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

609
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,292
I got my book.

610
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:03,751
Say, say, where's the bad-guy saloon?

611
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:08,250
You just go straight through the Western town,
take a right and a left, and you see it right there.

612
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,250
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah, that's better. That's better. Yeah.

613
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:14,375
Can we move to number two?

614
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:16,250
How is his bounce?

615
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:17,626
Can I get a bounce there?

616
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:19,918
Just grab the crescent wrench, come right back.

617
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,500
Just make it a quick one.

618
00:52:22,834 --> 00:52:25,292
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

619
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:12,042
Hello.

620
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,834
Hello.

621
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:19,459
Hello.

622
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:27,209
Would it bother you if I sat next to you
and read my book too?

623
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:30,500
I don't know.

624
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,334
Would you bother me?

625
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:35,709
I'll try not to.

626
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,250
Sit.

627
00:54:27,459 --> 00:54:29,375
Sorry. Sorry about that.

628
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,000
You don't eat lunch?

629
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,584
I've got a scene after lunch.

630
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:42,500
Yeah?

631
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,542
Eating lunch before I do a scene makes me sluggish.

632
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:51,709
I believe it's the job of an actor--
And I say "actor," not "actress,"

633
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:54,626
because the word "actress" is nonsensical.

634
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:59,167
It's the actor's job to avoid
impediments to their performance.

635
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,876
It's the actor's job
to strive for 100 percent effectiveness.

636
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:07,542
Naturally, we never succeed, but it's the pursuit...

637
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:09,918
that's meaningful.

638
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,626
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

639
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:17,500
Mar-- Marabella what?

640
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:19,125
Marabella Lancer.

641
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:22,500
No, no, come on, come on. What's your real name?

642
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:28,667
When we're on set, I'd prefer to only be referred to
by my character's name.

643
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:31,876
It helps me invest in the reality of the story.

644
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,167
I've tried it both ways,

645
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,542
and I'm always just a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

646
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:40,250
And if I can be a tiny bit better, I want to be.

647
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,375
You're the bad guy. Caleb DeCoteau.

648
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:53,334
I thought it was pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

649
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:56,125
I'm pretty sure it's "DeCoteau."

650
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,125
DeCoteau.

651
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,417
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

652
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:24,250
What are you reading?

653
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:28,042
It's a biography on Walt Disney.

654
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:29,751
It's fascinating.

655
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:31,709
He's a genius, you know.

656
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:35,209
I mean,
a once-in-every-50-or-100-years kind of genius.

657
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,709
What are you, 12?

658
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:39,459
I'm 8.

659
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:41,709
What are you reading?

660
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:44,959
Just a Western.

661
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:48,042
What does that mean? Is it good?

662
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,167
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

663
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,250
I haven't finished it yet.

664
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:57,500
I didn't ask for the whole story.

665
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,375
What's the idea of the story?

666
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,000
Well...

667
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:05,584
it's about this guy who's a bronco buster.

668
00:57:06,584 --> 00:57:08,626
It's the story of his life.

669
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,709
Guy's name is Tom Breezy,

670
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:14,876
but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy.

671
00:57:14,959 --> 00:57:17,584
Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s

672
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,751
and young and good-looking,

673
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:24,125
he could break any horse that you could throw at him.

674
00:57:24,209 --> 00:57:27,125
Back then, he just had a way.

675
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:33,292
Now he's into his late 30s and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

676
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:38,292
He's not-- He's not--
He's not crippled or anything like that, but--

677
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:42,792
But he's got spine problems he never had before,
and he spends...

678
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:48,375
more of his days in pain than he ever did before.

679
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:50,792
Jeepers, this sounds like a good novel.

680
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:53,626
Yeah, it's not bad.

681
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,459
Where are you in it?

682
00:57:57,584 --> 00:57:58,834
About midway.

683
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:03,042
What's happening to Easy Breezy now?

684
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,876
He's... He...

685
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:09,584
He's not the best anymore.

686
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:12,751
In fact, far from it. And...

687
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,250
he's coming to terms with
what it's like to be slightly more...

688
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:22,292
use--

689
00:58:30,626 --> 00:58:34,209
Slightly more useless each day.

690
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,292
It's okay, Caleb.

691
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,959
It's okay.

692
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:56,500
It sounds like a really sad book.

693
00:58:56,584 --> 00:58:58,542
Poor Easy Breezy.

694
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:01,125
I'm practically crying and I haven't even read it.

695
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:06,500
- About 15 years, you'll be living it.
- What?

696
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:12,584
Nothing, pumpkin puss. I'm just...

697
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:15,167
I'm just teasing you.

698
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:18,000
You know something? You...

699
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:22,459
You might be right about this book.

700
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:25,459
I think it hits harder than I gave it credit for.

701
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:30,918
I don't like names like "pumpkin puss,"

702
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:36,000
but since you're upset,
we'll talk about that some other time.

703
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:34,834
- I'm only going as far as Westwood Village.
- Hey, beggars can't be choosers.

704
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:35,834
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

705
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:58,375
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

706
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,209
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

707
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:03,792
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

708
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:05,083
- Take care.
- You too.

709
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:14,083
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

710
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,542
How can I help you, young lady?

711
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:23,500
I'm here to pick up a first edition
of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles I ordered.

712
01:02:23,584 --> 01:02:24,834
It's under Polanski.

713
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:27,209
- Yeah, you're talking books there, kid.
- Oh, I know.

714
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:28,792
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah. Oh, man.

715
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:30,334
- I just read it.
- Yeah.

716
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,792
I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.

717
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,083
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

718
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:41,083
Jim Stacy. This is my show. Welcome aboard.

719
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:44,167
We're real glad to have a pro like you
playing the heavy on the pilot.

720
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:49,459
And I gotta tell you, I came damn close
to being in The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

721
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:50,751
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

722
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:52,459
Let me tell you, I--

723
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,792
I just got my part by sheer luck.

724
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:58,417
Up until two weeks before shooting,
Fabian was in the part.

725
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,834
Then he breaks his shoulder doing a Virginian.
That's how I got it, so...

726
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:08,918
Hey, Rick,
I gotta ask you something I heard about.

727
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,083
Was it true you almost got the McQueen part
in The Great Escape?

728
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:16,667
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

729
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,584
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

730
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:22,751
Never had an audition. Never had a meeting.
Never met John Sturges.

731
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:25,417
So, no, I don't think you could say I...

732
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,542
I almost got the part, but...

733
01:03:27,626 --> 01:03:29,959
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

734
01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:33,667
I suppose what's called
in the American Army, a hotshot pilot.

735
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:38,626
But the story goes, for a brief moment,

736
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:42,792
McQueen almost passed on the movie,
and during that brief moment,

737
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:45,500
I, apparently, was on a list of four.

738
01:03:45,584 --> 01:03:46,751
You have other plans?

739
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,709
I haven't seen Berlin yet
from the ground or from the air,

740
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,000
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

741
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,500
You and who?

742
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:56,834
- Me and-- Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

743
01:03:56,918 --> 01:03:58,459
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

744
01:03:58,542 --> 01:04:00,083
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

745
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,459
That's gotta hurt.

746
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,626
Yeah, well, I didn't get it,

747
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,042
McQueen did it,

748
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:08,125
and, frankly, I never had a chance.

749
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:11,876
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

750
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:13,000
Captain Hilts.

751
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,083
Twenty days.

752
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:16,000
Right.

753
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:20,167
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

754
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:22,542
Cooler.

755
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:21,042
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

756
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:26,417
What if I'm in the movie?

757
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,125
What do you mean?

758
01:05:28,209 --> 01:05:30,876
I mean, I'm in the movie.

759
01:05:30,959 --> 01:05:32,417
I'm Sharon Tate.

760
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,459
You're in this?

761
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:37,292
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

762
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:39,667
That's me.

763
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,167
But that's the girl from Valley of the Dolls.

764
01:05:45,626 --> 01:05:49,876
Well, that's me, the girl from Valley of the Dolls.

765
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:53,000
- Really?
- Really.

766
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,334
Hey, Rubin! Come out here.

767
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:03,834
This is the girl from Valley of the Dolls.

768
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,167
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

769
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,250
- The girl from Peyton Place?
- No, the other one.

770
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:10,751
The one who ends up doing dirty movies.

771
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:15,459
- She's in this movie.
- Sharon Tate.

772
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:20,709
Well, welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.
Thank you for coming to our theater.

773
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,584
- Would you like to come in and see the show?
- Could I?

774
01:06:23,959 --> 01:06:25,250
By all means.

775
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,083
Thank you.

776
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,042
- Hey, can I get a picture?
- Oh, sure.

777
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,000
Okay.

778
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:41,751
You know, why don't you stand over by the poster
so people will know who you are.

779
01:06:41,834 --> 01:06:44,167
Okay. Could you?

780
01:06:56,792 --> 01:06:58,292
Would you like some refreshments?

781
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,500
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

782
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:40,584
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- I wish you would.

783
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:44,792
How did a nice boy like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?

784
01:07:44,876 --> 01:07:48,375
I turned to them after I was rejected
by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

785
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,417
Very pleasant hotel here.

786
01:08:14,542 --> 01:08:16,209
- Mr. Helm?
- Yes?

787
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:22,667
I'm Freya.

788
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:24,792
Welcome to Denmark, Mr. Helm.

789
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:26,834
These are for you.

790
01:08:26,918 --> 01:08:29,000
Street maps, places of interest.

791
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,459
This is for you too.

792
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:34,083
- What year was that?
- 1949.

793
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:37,459
- Oh, that's a very good year.
- I'm here to help you in any way I can.

794
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:40,334
- That's very nice of you.
- Is there anything you'd like me to do?

795
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:43,083
- Yes, ma'am, a couple things.
- Yes, sir.

796
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:46,626
Would you mind getting off my camera case, please?

797
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:48,292
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.

798
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,459
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

799
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:51,626
I'm sorry about...

800
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,626
Welcome to Denmark.

801
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:06,209
This is some kind of hotel you've got here.

802
01:09:08,459 --> 01:09:10,584
Half a bottle is better than none.

803
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:21,334
Morning, partner.

804
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,626
Probably come by to see you later.

805
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:00,000
That's far enough, jughead.

806
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,834
Name's not jughead.

807
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:06,334
What you doing around here, boy?

808
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:09,375
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon, ain't it?

809
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,584
Oh, yeah, that's a saloon.

810
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,250
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

811
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:20,209
Don't let me stop you from earning your money.

812
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:27,125
I know how bored and restless you get
when you run out of tamales.

813
01:10:28,626 --> 01:10:30,918
But, Mr. Gilbert, if I was you,

814
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,667
I'd find out that jughead's name.

815
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:38,709
Allow me to introduce the two of you.

816
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,667
This here is Bob Gilbert.

817
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,500
The Businessman?

818
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:46,792
That's right.

819
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:51,876
Business Bob Gilbert. And who might he be, Caleb?

820
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:54,500
Well, that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

821
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,459
Johnny Madrid.

822
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:00,375
Who's Johnny Madrid?

823
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:08,250
He ain't from round here.

824
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:10,459
No, really.

825
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:11,584
Who is he, Caleb?

826
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:18,250
Oh, you're about to find out...

827
01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:21,042
Businessman.

828
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,709
Ready when you are, Gilbert.

829
01:12:23,751 --> 01:12:25,417
Johnny Madrid.

830
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,584
How long has it been?

831
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:36,167
Since that time in Juarez, about three years ago.

832
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:39,709
Well, come on in and have a drink.

833
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,209
Hell, in that case...

834
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,584
buy you a drink, Caleb?

835
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:47,834
Sure, Johnny.

836
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:51,751
How about some mezcal?

837
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,959
Like that time in Juárez.

838
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,792
A lot of people died that day.

839
01:12:57,876 --> 01:12:59,417
Yes, they did.

840
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,334
But we had a good time.

841
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:04,542
Didn't we?

842
01:13:04,626 --> 01:13:06,709
Yeah, we did.

843
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:09,417
After you, DeCoteau.

844
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:13,834
Pepe! Get your behind behind that bar.

845
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:15,334
I have a guest.

846
01:13:31,918 --> 01:13:33,167
How's the beans?

847
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:36,042
I've had worse.

848
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:39,792
One dollar.

849
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:46,500
To my wife and all my sweethearts.

850
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:49,083
May they never meet.

851
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,918
Sefior Madrid, you care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?

852
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:03,500
I'd be delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

853
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:07,083
Take the bottle with you.

854
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:10,500
So, Johnny...

855
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:14,834
what brings you to Arroyo del Oro?

856
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:17,876
Oh, you know me, Caleb.

857
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:18,959
Money.

858
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:23,000
And who's paying around here?

859
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,167
I hope you.

860
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,959
And what have you heard about me?

861
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:30,876
I heard about the Lancer Ranch.

862
01:14:30,959 --> 01:14:33,167
All the cattle you've appropriated.

863
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:36,542
A lot of land, a lot of cows,
a lot of money, no law to speak of,

864
01:14:36,626 --> 01:14:40,876
and nothing but an old man
and some Mexican ranch hands to shoo you off.

865
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:48,083
Say, where's that chili pepper daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

866
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,918
She's asleep.

867
01:14:50,042 --> 01:14:55,167
Wake her the heck up, get her down here
with her fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guest.

868
01:14:58,584 --> 01:15:00,876
But, please, don't hurt her this time.

869
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,959
I ain't gonna hurt her.

870
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:07,000
I just want her to play the fiddle.

871
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:14,292
Line? "Go-- Go fetch her and tell her" what?

872
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:17,500
"Go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece..."

873
01:15:17,584 --> 01:15:21,417
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,

874
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,626
she play her little chili pepper heart out, right?

875
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:24,751
- Right.
- Got it.

876
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,250
I ain't gonna hurt her.

877
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:35,626
I just want her to play the fiddle.

878
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:38,792
Now, go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,

879
01:15:38,876 --> 01:15:41,959
she play her little chili pepper heart out.

880
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:43,042
Go on.

881
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:49,792
So, Johnny,

882
01:15:50,959 --> 01:15:52,626
what else you heard?

883
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,876
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

884
01:15:56,959 --> 01:15:59,751
but Lancer's got money.

885
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:02,918
At some point,

886
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,334
he's gonna hire some guns

887
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:07,584
and push back.

888
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:18,167
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

889
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,834
Maybe...

890
01:16:21,918 --> 01:16:24,417
- Goddamn it! I fucked this whole thing up, Sam.
- Keep going!

891
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,042
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

892
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,250
Can we just go back? Please, can we just cut?

893
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,125
- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, really, Sam, please.

894
01:16:31,209 --> 01:16:33,167
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right, all right!

895
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,334
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

896
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:36,667
All right, all right!

897
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,417
You're a goddamn outlaw, Rick. Come on, now.

898
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,876
I got it. I got it.

899
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,500
Go back a bit, would you?

900
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,250
No, he's right. Back to one.

901
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,500
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

902
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:54,042
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

903
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,125
I'm gonna use it.

904
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,083
And...

905
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,000
action.

906
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:05,709
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

907
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:08,375
but Lancer's got money.

908
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,417
At some point,

909
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,834
he's gonna hire some guns and push back.

910
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,375
Maybe he already has.

911
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:24,083
Maybe.

912
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:29,083
Maybe I don't like Lancer.

913
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,417
Maybe I don't like his boots.

914
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,334
Maybe I don't like the way
he uses those boots to step on people.

915
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,167
What the fuck was that?!

916
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,667
Jesus Christ!

917
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,000
Fuck!

918
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,334
Piece of shit.

919
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:52,417
Fucking damn it, Rick, I swear to God.

920
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,209
Forgot your fucking lines,
embarrassed yourself like that

921
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:57,083
in front of all those goddamn people!

922
01:17:57,209 --> 01:18:00,834
Well, you were drinking all night,
fucking drinking again,

923
01:18:00,918 --> 01:18:03,209
eight goddamn fucking whiskey sours.

924
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:06,459
Fucking bullshit.

925
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:10,709
You're a fucking miserable drunk.

926
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,125
Not fucking remembering your fucking lines.

927
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,000
I practiced them,
and now I don't look like I goddamn practiced them!

928
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,375
You're sitting there like a fucking baboon!

929
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,083
Fuck! Eight fucking whiskey sours.

930
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,292
I couldn't stop at fucking three or four.

931
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:26,167
I have eight!

932
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,876
Why?! You're a fucking alcoholic.
You fucking drink too much, huh?

933
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:32,375
Every fucking night. Every fucking night.

934
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:34,542
That's it, that's fucking it!

935
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:35,500
That's fucking it.

936
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:37,918
You stop drinking right now, all right?

937
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,584
Make a promise to yourself.
You're gonna stop fucking drinking.

938
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:42,709
Oh, fuck it.

939
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:47,167
Damn it!

940
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:52,250
You show that little fucking girl.
You're gonna show that goddamn Jim Stacy.

941
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,792
You're gonna show all of them
on that goddamn fucking set

942
01:18:54,876 --> 01:18:56,584
who the fuck Rick Dalton is, all right?

943
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,834
Let me tell you something.

944
01:18:58,918 --> 01:19:01,542
You don't get these lines right,

945
01:19:01,626 --> 01:19:04,584
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out tonight.

946
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:09,125
All right? Your brains are gonna be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

947
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,125
I mean it, motherfucker.

948
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:12,626
Get your shit together.

949
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:20,500
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

950
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:47,542
Hey!

951
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:49,417
Hi.

952
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,125
Shit.

953
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:07,292
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

954
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,250
Oh, no.

955
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:25,834
Hello, hot stuff.

956
01:22:26,584 --> 01:22:28,125
Looks like third time's the charm.

957
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:30,292
How were those pickles?

958
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:36,918
Real good. They were the fancy kind.

959
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:40,751
Give me a lift?

960
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:42,417
Where are you going?

961
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:45,375
I'm going to Chatsworth.

962
01:22:46,209 --> 01:22:47,209
Chatsworth?

963
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:53,000
You hitch up and down Burbank Boulevard all day
till someone says they'll drive you to Chatsworth?

964
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:55,626
Tourists love to drive me.

965
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:57,709
I'm their favorite part of their L.A. vacation.

966
01:22:57,792 --> 01:23:01,417
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

967
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,209
that they gave a ride to the movie ranch
for the rest of their lives.

968
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:06,751
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

969
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:10,626
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going? Spahn Movie Ranch?

970
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:13,083
Why you going there?

971
01:23:13,876 --> 01:23:14,792
I live there.

972
01:23:15,626 --> 01:23:18,209
- Alone?
- No.

973
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:19,500
Me and my friends.

974
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:25,292
So you and a bunch of friends like you all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

975
01:23:26,834 --> 01:23:27,709
Yeah.

976
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,667
Well, hop in. I'll take you there.

977
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,500
Great!

978
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:46,375
- Go down here and get on the Hollywood Freeway.
- I know where it is.

979
01:23:48,959 --> 01:23:52,375
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

980
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:55,626
What?

981
01:23:55,709 --> 01:23:58,584
I'm just surprised how accurate
that description of me really is.

982
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:02,375
Some old cowboy guy that used to shoot movies
at Spahn Ranch.

983
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:08,000
So you used to make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?

984
01:24:10,209 --> 01:24:16,250
Well, if by "the old-timey days,"
you mean television eight years ago, yeah.

985
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:17,709
Are you an actor?

986
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,417
No, I'm a stuntman.

987
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:21,751
You're a stuntman.

988
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:24,667
That's way better.

989
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:27,167
Why is that way better?

990
01:24:28,459 --> 01:24:29,542
Actors are phony.

991
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:32,751
They just say lines that other people write

992
01:24:32,918 --> 01:24:36,042
and pretend to murder people on their stupid TV shows.

993
01:24:36,667 --> 01:24:39,792
Meanwhile, real people are being murdered
every day in Vietnam.

994
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:04,334
Want me to suck your cock while driving?

995
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:14,250
How old are you?

996
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,542
What?

997
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:18,334
How old are you?

998
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:21,626
Wow, man.

999
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:26,292
That's the first time
anybody asked that in a long time.

1000
01:25:26,834 --> 01:25:27,918
What's the answer?

1001
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:33,334
Okay. We gonna play kiddie games?

1002
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:37,751
Eighteen. Feel better?

1003
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:41,959
You got some ID, you know,
like a driver's license or something?

1004
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:43,292
Are you joking?

1005
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,334
No, I'm not.

1006
01:25:44,834 --> 01:25:48,417
I need to see something
official that verifies that you're 18,

1007
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,876
which you don't have
because you're not.

1008
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,042
Talk about a bring-down bummer, dude.

1009
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:58,250
That's you.

1010
01:25:58,334 --> 01:25:59,167
Yeah.

1011
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:07,459
Obviously, I'm not too young to fuck you.

1012
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,459
But obviously, you are too old to fuck me.

1013
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,959
What I'm too old to do is go to jail for poontang.

1014
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:19,125
Prison's been trying to get me all my life.

1015
01:26:19,209 --> 01:26:20,125
It ain't got me yet.

1016
01:26:20,209 --> 01:26:21,709
The day it does,

1017
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:23,459
it won't be because of you.

1018
01:26:24,334 --> 01:26:25,542
No offense.

1019
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,417
You all right, honey?

1020
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,792
She's just fine, ain't you, shorty?

1021
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:34,792
I'm fine, Scott.

1022
01:26:34,876 --> 01:26:37,584
- They haven't hurt you?
- Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

1023
01:26:39,876 --> 01:26:41,125
I'll be right out.

1024
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:43,584
The war.

1025
01:26:45,042 --> 01:26:47,792
I rode with the British cavalry in Indi--

1026
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:42,167
Stand by, guys. We're going in five.

1027
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,459
Lancer's boys are here!

1028
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,209
The old man here?

1029
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:03,500
Nada.

1030
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,500
But the son is.

1031
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,167
The one from Boston.

1032
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:13,292
I don't know.

1033
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:15,709
You from Boston?

1034
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:16,876
Yes.

1035
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,459
It's the Boston one!

1036
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:22,125
Keep the others outside.

1037
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:24,667
Let the brother come in.

1038
01:28:26,209 --> 01:28:28,000
You heard him, Boston.

1039
01:28:36,918 --> 01:28:38,876
Come on in, Boston.

1040
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:41,542
See, honey?

1041
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:43,918
I told you they'd come to parlay.

1042
01:28:45,459 --> 01:28:46,751
You all right, honey?

1043
01:28:46,834 --> 01:28:49,876
Oh, she's just fine.

1044
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:51,083
Ain't you, shorty?

1045
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:54,083
I'm fine, Scott.

1046
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,209
They haven't hurt you?

1047
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:58,918
Not yet, I ain't.

1048
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,834
But that can all change...

1049
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:02,918
like that.

1050
01:29:06,667 --> 01:29:07,500
Say...

1051
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,959
where'd you get that limp?

1052
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:12,375
From the war.

1053
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,042
Which side?

1054
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:18,959
I rode with the British cavalry in India.

1055
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:22,667
What'd they call that outfit?

1056
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:24,876
Bengal Lancers.

1057
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:30,834
Now, now, now, that is funny.

1058
01:29:30,918 --> 01:29:33,417
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

1059
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,792
Don't you get it?

1060
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:36,876
"Bengal Lancer"?

1061
01:29:38,334 --> 01:29:39,709
Oh, yeah.

1062
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,459
I get it now.

1063
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,125
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1064
01:29:44,751 --> 01:29:47,751
You do know kidnapping is a hanging offense.

1065
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,751
So is blowing the heads off little girls.

1066
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:55,292
But they can only hang me once, right?

1067
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:57,375
So...

1068
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:00,584
you come down here for a--

1069
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:03,000
For a Boston social?

1070
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:05,751
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

1071
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:09,876
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1072
01:30:09,959 --> 01:30:13,459
a whole lot of chicken mole in Mexico.

1073
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:15,000
That's a lot of money.

1074
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:17,459
Well, she's a lot of little girl.

1075
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:18,834
Or don't you agree?

1076
01:30:19,876 --> 01:30:20,876
I agree.

1077
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:23,918
So, what's next?

1078
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:29,375
I'll send one of my boys out to your ranch
to fill you in on all the details...

1079
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:35,083
but the one detail
I'm gonna fill you in on right now is this:

1080
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:41,042
I don't want no beaner bronco buster
handing me that $50,000.

1081
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:44,375
I want the old man himself.

1082
01:30:44,459 --> 01:30:50,042
Murdoch Lancer puts $50,000 in my lap...

1083
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:53,334
or I heave this little pitcher down a well!

1084
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:55,959
You got that, Boston?

1085
01:30:57,918 --> 01:30:58,751
Yeah.

1086
01:30:59,959 --> 01:31:01,792
All right, messenger boy.

1087
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:04,834
Deliver my message.

1088
01:31:11,542 --> 01:31:15,042
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1089
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,959
Settle into it.

1090
01:31:17,042 --> 01:31:18,334
Enjoy it.

1091
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:20,334
And cut!

1092
01:31:22,959 --> 01:31:24,334
Oh, boy.

1093
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,918
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella, with that throw, did I?

1094
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,500
No, no, no. I'm good. I got pads on.

1095
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:34,792
And I throw myself on the floor just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

1096
01:31:35,334 --> 01:31:36,334
The gate's clean.

1097
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:39,167
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1098
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,876
Put her there.

1099
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:42,125
- That was it.
- Really?

1100
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:43,500
That was absolutely fantastic.

1101
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:44,876
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

1102
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:49,000
Hey, and your idea about throwing the little girl
on the ground, that just worked like a charm.

1103
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:52,334
- I figured you said Shakespeare, so... Yeah.
- That's right. That was--

1104
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:54,542
That's what I mean by "scare me."

1105
01:31:54,626 --> 01:31:57,042
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1106
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:59,584
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

1107
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:01,792
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

1108
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:04,459
- Where the hell did that come from?
- I don't know. Improv.

1109
01:32:04,542 --> 01:32:09,292
That was wonderful. It was just--
That was a triple alliterative improv.

1110
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:10,918
You don't hear those too often.

1111
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,751
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't--?

1112
01:32:12,834 --> 01:32:15,375
- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done. That was fantastic.

1113
01:32:15,459 --> 01:32:18,042
- All right.
- Okay, moving on. We're in the bordello.

1114
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,125
Next setup!

1115
01:32:23,334 --> 01:32:27,167
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1116
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:29,542
Thank you.

1117
01:32:47,876 --> 01:32:49,792
Rick fucking Dalton.

1118
01:33:02,667 --> 01:33:03,709
That's a car.

1119
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:06,751
That's a strange car.

1120
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,709
Snake, go see who's outside.

1121
01:33:22,834 --> 01:33:24,292
So who is it?

1122
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:25,667
I ain't for sure yet.

1123
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,250
It's a bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.

1124
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,500
Keep an eye on him.

1125
01:34:19,709 --> 01:34:20,626
Come on.

1126
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:39,584
Where the hell is everybody?

1127
01:34:48,834 --> 01:34:49,959
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1128
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,125
She's down by the chop shop.

1129
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:01,125
- Hey!
- Hello!

1130
01:35:01,209 --> 01:35:04,292
Gypsy! I want you to come meet my new friend.

1131
01:35:04,626 --> 01:35:08,500
Some old-looking dude in a Hawaiian shirt
who just gave Pussycat a ride home.

1132
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:10,250
He just gave her a lift?

1133
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:14,667
Nope. She's bringing him
down the ranch to meet everybody.

1134
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,417
Stay by the door.

1135
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,083
Tell me if he starts
coming this way.

1136
01:35:19,209 --> 01:35:21,626
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1137
01:35:21,709 --> 01:35:24,083
And thank you for giving our
precious Pussy a ride home.

1138
01:35:24,167 --> 01:35:25,459
Think nothing of it.

1139
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:27,375
We love Pussy.

1140
01:35:27,459 --> 01:35:28,709
Yes, we do.

1141
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:30,834
Hey, where is everybody? Where's the children?

1142
01:35:30,918 --> 01:35:33,500
Everybody left for Santa Barbara.

1143
01:35:33,584 --> 01:35:35,167
Really?

1144
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,292
Charlie's gone? Everybody left?

1145
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:40,459
Well, not everybody-everybody, but mostly everybody.

1146
01:35:43,334 --> 01:35:44,250
Drag.

1147
01:35:45,584 --> 01:35:47,334
I really wanted Cliff to meet Charlie.

1148
01:35:48,584 --> 01:35:50,709
I think Charlie's really gonna dig you.

1149
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:53,125
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

1150
01:35:53,209 --> 01:35:54,417
Yeah, you got to come back.

1151
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:58,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

1152
01:35:59,459 --> 01:36:02,292
So how's it all comparing to your glory days?

1153
01:36:02,375 --> 01:36:04,334
Well, things have changed.

1154
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:09,709
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1155
01:36:09,792 --> 01:36:11,918
I used to ride horses every day back in Tennessee.

1156
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,250
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1157
01:36:14,334 --> 01:36:16,334
Well, every week.

1158
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:18,042
All right.

1159
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:19,876
Ain't she just darling?

1160
01:36:23,459 --> 01:36:26,667
So my name is Lulu.

1161
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:27,959
This is Tex.

1162
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:33,459
We're gonna be leading you on a great trail ride
through the beautiful Santa Susana canyons.

1163
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:36,792
Now, Curt,
I hear you're already an experienced rider.

1164
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:39,209
- Yes.
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?

1165
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:40,626
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex?

1166
01:36:40,709 --> 01:36:43,959
- Come here.
- So if you're both experienced riders,

1167
01:36:44,042 --> 01:36:47,250
I guess we'll just make this ride about having fun.

1168
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:48,500
You ready to have some fun?

1169
01:36:48,584 --> 01:36:51,500
So Pussycat brought back some guy with her.

1170
01:36:51,584 --> 01:36:54,125
- Gypsy wants you to go give him a look-see.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

1171
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:17,125
Oh, and here's someone you absolutely have to meet.

1172
01:37:17,209 --> 01:37:19,584
One of our most favorite sons.

1173
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:22,334
Tex, come on over here and say hi to Cliff.

1174
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:24,584
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1175
01:37:24,667 --> 01:37:28,292
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1176
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:29,209
Copeville.

1177
01:37:30,209 --> 01:37:31,542
Ever been to Houston?

1178
01:37:31,626 --> 01:37:33,125
Course I have.

1179
01:37:33,209 --> 01:37:35,709
Yeah, I spent two weeks
once on a Houston chain gang.

1180
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:37,125
In August, no less.

1181
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,542
That doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.

1182
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:43,125
It's the last cop's jaw I ever broke,
I can tell you that.

1183
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,375
Man...

1184
01:37:49,709 --> 01:37:51,334
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1185
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:54,626
The Hawaiian guy seems to be okay.

1186
01:37:54,709 --> 01:37:56,792
Everybody's talking all friendly.

1187
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:59,083
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

1188
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,500
Tex checked him out, and now he's riding away.

1189
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,417
If he comes this way, let me know.

1190
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:10,792
Hey, does George Spahn still own this ranch?

1191
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:12,876
Yeah, George still owns it.

1192
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:16,000
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

1193
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:19,000
Does he still live right there?

1194
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:20,083
Yeah.

1195
01:38:20,167 --> 01:38:21,500
Is he here now?

1196
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:23,292
I guess so.

1197
01:38:25,209 --> 01:38:27,918
So George gave you all permission to be here?

1198
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:30,209
Course he did.

1199
01:38:30,292 --> 01:38:31,918
And y'all take care of him?

1200
01:38:32,959 --> 01:38:35,250
Oh, we take care of George.

1201
01:38:35,334 --> 01:38:36,542
We love George.

1202
01:38:38,834 --> 01:38:42,584
Is there anything wrong
with me saying hello to an old friend?

1203
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,500
You can't see him right now.

1204
01:38:44,584 --> 01:38:46,876
Why can't I see him right now?

1205
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:49,667
Because he's napping.

1206
01:38:51,876 --> 01:38:53,209
This is his nap time.

1207
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:06,083
Well, I think I'll just go see for myself.

1208
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:09,209
You never know.

1209
01:39:09,292 --> 01:39:10,918
He might have just woke up.

1210
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:22,667
The old Hawaiian guy's coming this way.

1211
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:25,542
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1212
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:26,876
I'll handle this guy.

1213
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,083
Fine.

1214
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:19,250
You the mama bear?

1215
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,167
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

1216
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,709
I'm an old friend of George's.

1217
01:40:24,792 --> 01:40:26,209
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1218
01:40:26,626 --> 01:40:29,709
That's very nice of you,
but unfortunately, you picked the wrong time.

1219
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:31,459
George is taking a nap right now.

1220
01:40:31,918 --> 01:40:33,834
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1221
01:40:33,918 --> 01:40:35,250
Yes, it is.

1222
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:39,000
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

1223
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,500
How do you know George?

1224
01:40:40,584 --> 01:40:43,000
I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch.

1225
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:45,042
When was the last time you saw George?

1226
01:40:45,459 --> 01:40:48,709
Oh, I'd say about...

1227
01:40:49,584 --> 01:40:51,000
eight years ago.

1228
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:56,334
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
the two of you were so close.

1229
01:40:57,626 --> 01:40:59,834
When he wakes up, I'll let him know you came by.

1230
01:41:00,459 --> 01:41:04,375
I'd really like to say
a quick hello now while I'm here.

1231
01:41:04,459 --> 01:41:06,000
Came a long ways.

1232
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,918
Don't know when I'll get back this way again.

1233
01:41:09,334 --> 01:41:11,792
Oh, I understand,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1234
01:41:12,584 --> 01:41:14,250
Impossible?

1235
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:16,125
Why is that impossible?

1236
01:41:16,209 --> 01:41:19,584
Because me and George like to watch TV
on Sunday night-- FBI. and Bonanza.

1237
01:41:19,709 --> 01:41:22,417
--But George finds it hard to keep awake that late,
so I make him take a nap now

1238
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,584
so I don't get gypped out of my George TV time.

1239
01:41:27,209 --> 01:41:31,334
Well, look, Red, I'm coming in there.

1240
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:34,959
With my own two eyes,
I'm gonna get a good look at George.

1241
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:37,459
And this...

1242
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:40,667
ain't stopping me.

1243
01:41:44,459 --> 01:41:45,292
Okay.

1244
01:41:46,584 --> 01:41:48,167
Suit yourself.

1245
01:43:14,209 --> 01:43:15,500
He back there?

1246
01:43:17,209 --> 01:43:19,083
Door at the end of the hallway.

1247
01:43:20,542 --> 01:43:23,918
You might have to shake him awake.
I fucked his brains out this morning.

1248
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:30,542
He may be tired.

1249
01:43:42,792 --> 01:43:44,459
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1250
01:43:46,209 --> 01:43:49,667
George is blind,
so you'll probably have to tell him who you are.

1251
01:44:15,834 --> 01:44:17,375
George, you awake?

1252
01:44:35,667 --> 01:44:36,709
George?

1253
01:44:39,042 --> 01:44:40,083
George?

1254
01:44:44,083 --> 01:44:45,042
George?

1255
01:44:47,334 --> 01:44:50,292
- George!
- Jesus.

1256
01:44:50,459 --> 01:44:52,375
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

1257
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:55,167
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1258
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:58,375
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Who are you?

1259
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:00,334
It's Cliff Booth.

1260
01:45:00,459 --> 01:45:03,626
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doing.

1261
01:45:03,709 --> 01:45:05,042
John Wilkes Booth?

1262
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:06,667
No, Cliff Booth.

1263
01:45:08,918 --> 01:45:10,209
Who's that?

1264
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:12,876
I used to shoot Bounty Law here, George.

1265
01:45:12,959 --> 01:45:14,959
I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1266
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:17,876
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

1267
01:45:17,959 --> 01:45:19,584
The Dalton Brothers?

1268
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,375
No, Rick Dalton.

1269
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:23,918
Who's that?

1270
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,918
He was the star of Bounty Law.

1271
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,709
And who are you?

1272
01:45:28,792 --> 01:45:30,500
I was Rick's stunt double.

1273
01:45:31,626 --> 01:45:33,542
Rick who?

1274
01:45:33,626 --> 01:45:35,334
It don't matter, George.

1275
01:45:35,459 --> 01:45:40,500
We were colleagues from the past,
and I just wanted to make sure you're doing okay.

1276
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,918
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

1277
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,584
Can't see shit. Would you call that "the matter"?

1278
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:50,959
- The man can't see shit, okay?
- I know. I'm sorry about that. I was told.

1279
01:45:51,042 --> 01:45:53,125
Squeaky sent me to bed.

1280
01:45:53,751 --> 01:45:56,042
Would that be the little redhead out front?

1281
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,626
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1282
01:46:01,709 --> 01:46:05,584
First you wake me up,
and now you're pretending that I didn't tell you

1283
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:07,375
I was fucking blind!

1284
01:46:07,834 --> 01:46:10,918
How am I gonna know what the hell color the head

1285
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,751
of the girl is that's with me all the time?

1286
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:15,709
Oh, fair enough, George.

1287
01:46:19,125 --> 01:46:22,459
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

1288
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:25,125
Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1289
01:46:32,751 --> 01:46:34,542
I don't know who you are...

1290
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:38,792
but you touched me today.

1291
01:46:40,751 --> 01:46:43,334
You came to visit me.

1292
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:45,500
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1293
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,709
I got to watch F.B.I. tonight.

1294
01:46:50,792 --> 01:46:52,459
I watch it with Squeaky.

1295
01:46:53,667 --> 01:46:56,500
She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep.

1296
01:46:57,542 --> 01:47:00,250
What happens when she gets pissed off, George?

1297
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,626
Nothing.

1298
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:06,584
I just don't like to disappoint her.

1299
01:47:11,417 --> 01:47:14,667
So you gave all these hippies permission to be here?

1300
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:23,167
Just who the fuck are you?

1301
01:47:23,209 --> 01:47:25,167
I'm Cliff Booth.

1302
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,792
I'm a stuntman. We used to work together, George.

1303
01:47:28,876 --> 01:47:31,626
And I just want to make sure you're okay.

1304
01:47:31,709 --> 01:47:35,417
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

1305
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:38,292
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1306
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:40,250
She loves me.

1307
01:47:42,834 --> 01:47:44,500
So suck on that.

1308
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:55,125
You take care, George.

1309
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,626
Goddamn it.

1310
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:26,459
You embarrassed me.

1311
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,250
Yeah, sorry about that.

1312
01:48:32,334 --> 01:48:35,125
How'd your little talk with George go?
Are we kidnapping him?

1313
01:48:35,209 --> 01:48:37,209
Not the word I'd use.

1314
01:48:37,292 --> 01:48:39,417
Now that you've talked to him,
do you believe everything's all right?

1315
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,375
Not exactly.

1316
01:48:41,459 --> 01:48:44,792
- This was a mistake. You should leave.
- Way ahead of you.

1317
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:51,751
George isn't blind!

1318
01:48:51,834 --> 01:48:53,292
You're the blind one!

1319
01:49:38,459 --> 01:49:39,792
You do that?

1320
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:46,125
You know, that's not my car.

1321
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,083
That's my boss's car.

1322
01:49:49,209 --> 01:49:52,834
And if something were to happen to my boss's car,
well, I'd get in trouble.

1323
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,751
Lucky for you, he's got a spare.

1324
01:50:11,542 --> 01:50:12,876
Fix it.

1325
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,167
Fuck you.

1326
01:50:47,292 --> 01:50:48,334
Ladies.

1327
01:50:55,667 --> 01:50:58,792
Come one step closer and I will knock his teeth out.

1328
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,209
Fix it.

1329
01:51:11,876 --> 01:51:14,167
Can I at least get a rag to wipe my face first?

1330
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:15,792
Nope.

1331
01:51:15,876 --> 01:51:17,584
Tire first.

1332
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:29,584
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

1333
01:51:29,667 --> 01:51:33,209
Get on a horse,
go get Tex and get his ass down here.

1334
01:51:33,292 --> 01:51:34,167
Okay.

1335
01:51:43,542 --> 01:51:45,292
I love you.

1336
01:52:09,584 --> 01:52:11,417
Tex! Tex!

1337
01:52:12,417 --> 01:52:15,334
That Hawaiian guy's back at the ranch
kicking Clem's face in.

1338
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:18,751
I'll take over for Tex.

1339
01:52:18,834 --> 01:52:19,959
Right this way.

1340
01:53:10,792 --> 01:53:11,792
Clem, you all right?

1341
01:53:33,626 --> 01:53:35,292
How do?

1342
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:38,918
What a day. Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1343
01:54:26,292 --> 01:54:27,626
You...

1344
01:54:27,959 --> 01:54:30,375
You want to come in and watch my F.B.I.?

1345
01:54:30,459 --> 01:54:31,709
Why, I just figured we would.

1346
01:54:31,792 --> 01:54:33,042
I got a six-pack in the back.

1347
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,542
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1348
01:54:34,626 --> 01:54:35,918
All right.

1349
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
All right.

1350
01:54:58,417 --> 01:55:00,959
Eighteen miles to Pendleton, Willard.

1351
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:03,083
Any kind of luck, we'll be unloaded

1352
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:05,959
and back at El Toro before my kids go to bed.

1353
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:14,500
Hey, bought me an acid-dipped cigarette today.

1354
01:55:14,584 --> 01:55:15,834
Oh, yeah?

1355
01:55:15,918 --> 01:55:17,918
You want to buy a cigarette dipped in acid?

1356
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,751
Yeah.

1357
01:55:19,834 --> 01:55:23,459
If I'm gonna trip, I want to trip here, man.
Walk in the woods. Not in my home.

1358
01:55:26,167 --> 01:55:27,250
Just gonna stash it here.

1359
01:55:27,334 --> 01:55:29,500
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

1360
01:55:29,584 --> 01:55:31,083
You want to smoke some,
smoke some.

1361
01:55:31,167 --> 01:55:32,042
Just save me some.

1362
01:55:32,542 --> 01:55:35,834
Nah, I don't need to trip out on no acid.

1363
01:55:35,918 --> 01:55:37,792
My booze don't need no buddy.

1364
01:55:39,292 --> 01:55:41,125
Here I come. Here I come.

1365
01:55:44,834 --> 01:55:46,542
What's the trouble, corporal?

1366
01:55:46,626 --> 01:55:48,250
There's a truck tailing us, sir.

1367
01:55:51,417 --> 01:55:53,959
It might be a farmer in a hurry to get some place.

1368
01:55:55,751 --> 01:55:57,459
Oh, fine.

1369
01:55:57,542 --> 01:56:00,959
- Well, take it as fast as you can.
- Yes, sir.

1370
01:56:04,209 --> 01:56:05,584
That PCH?

1371
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:08,709
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1372
01:56:08,792 --> 01:56:11,209
Puerco Canyon or some shit. I don't know.

1373
01:56:18,209 --> 01:56:19,667
Here comes trouble.

1374
01:56:24,209 --> 01:56:26,292
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1375
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:39,709
That was a smooth leap.

1376
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:40,792
Thank you.

1377
01:56:44,751 --> 01:56:46,334
Dead number two.

1378
01:56:53,584 --> 01:56:55,375
I like that shot.

1379
01:56:55,459 --> 01:56:57,500
That guy's a fucking prick.

1380
01:57:04,459 --> 01:57:06,292
That's Bobby Hogan. Good guy.

1381
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:18,042
All right, get ready for my big F.B.I. moment.

1382
01:57:18,125 --> 01:57:20,459
- They're all dead, babe.
- Good.

1383
01:57:28,751 --> 01:57:30,459
"Michael Murtaugh."

1384
01:57:30,542 --> 01:57:32,417
- The FBI.
- Michael Murtaugh.

1385
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,834
Buongiorno, Sergio.

1386
01:57:33,918 --> 01:57:35,709
Turn on Channel 7.

1387
01:57:35,792 --> 01:57:37,083
ABC.

1388
01:57:37,167 --> 01:57:38,834
F.B.I.

1389
01:57:38,918 --> 01:57:41,876
I'm watching your Nebraska Jim as we speak.

1390
01:57:41,959 --> 01:57:45,626
--Philip Abbott, William Reynolds.

1391
01:57:47,667 --> 01:57:51,375
With guest stars James Farentino,

1392
01:57:51,459 --> 01:57:53,000
Rick Dalton...

1393
01:57:53,083 --> 01:57:54,334
Like the chewing gum?

1394
01:57:54,417 --> 01:57:56,250
- Norman Fell.
- Strong.

1395
01:57:56,334 --> 01:57:57,918
Tonight's episode:

1396
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,500
- "All the Streets Are Silent."
- "All the Streets Are Silent."

1397
01:58:00,626 --> 01:58:03,500
Except when Rick Dalton's got a fucking shotgun,
I'll tell you that.

1398
01:58:03,584 --> 01:58:05,792
- You're goddamn right.
- ...the new Ford Cortina.

1399
01:58:26,876 --> 01:58:30,083
- Well, that looks delicious. Thank you.
- Enjoy, sir.

1400
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:38,334
After that Musso & Frank's lunch meeting,

1401
01:58:38,417 --> 01:58:42,334
Marvin did provide Rick job opportunities
in the Italian film industry.

1402
01:58:42,417 --> 01:58:45,834
Rick Dalton, Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.

1403
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:47,751
Hennessy X.O on the rocks.

1404
01:58:47,834 --> 01:58:49,334
Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

1405
01:58:49,417 --> 01:58:50,626
Two words.

1406
01:58:50,709 --> 01:58:53,209
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

1407
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:55,250
Nebraska what?

1408
01:58:55,334 --> 01:58:56,375
Sergio who?

1409
01:58:56,459 --> 01:58:58,042
Sergio Corbucci.

1410
01:58:58,125 --> 01:58:59,626
And who's that?

1411
01:58:59,709 --> 01:59:03,375
The second-best director of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

1412
01:59:03,459 --> 01:59:05,125
He's doing a new Western.

1413
01:59:05,209 --> 01:59:06,834
It's called Nebraska Jim.

1414
01:59:06,918 --> 01:59:09,417
And because of me, he's considering you.

1415
01:59:10,667 --> 01:59:12,459
Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.

1416
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,959
And Rick made a rather compelling Nebraska Jim,

1417
01:59:15,042 --> 01:59:19,959
existing quite nicely within Sergio Corbucci's
rogues gallery of antiheroes.

1418
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:24,459
In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi
and the fuss they made over him

1419
01:59:24,542 --> 01:59:28,250
and his Nebraska Jim costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.

1420
01:59:28,334 --> 01:59:29,959
All right there, paparazzos.

1421
01:59:30,042 --> 01:59:31,459
All right. Take it easy.

1422
01:59:31,959 --> 01:59:36,751
He loved the food so much that during his stay,
Rick gained almost 15 pounds.

1423
01:59:36,834 --> 01:59:39,792
But he didn't love
the Italians' way of making movies.

1424
01:59:39,876 --> 01:59:43,250
He thought the post-synced,
"every actor speaks their own language,"

1425
01:59:43,334 --> 01:59:47,209
Tower of Babel shooting style
of European movies was ridiculous.

1426
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:52,125
While in Rome, Marvin plugged Rick
into three other Italian productions.

1427
01:59:52,542 --> 01:59:56,083
His second Western was
Kill Me Quick, Ringo, Said the Gringo,

1428
01:59:56,167 --> 01:59:59,876
also starring Joseph Cotten
and directed by Calvin Jackson Padget,

1429
01:59:59,959 --> 02:00:02,209
pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.

1430
02:00:02,292 --> 02:00:04,792
His third was an Italian/Spanish coproduction

1431
02:00:04,876 --> 02:00:09,042
that paired him with Telly Savalas,
titled Red Blood, Red Skin,

1432
02:00:09,125 --> 02:00:13,292
directed by Joaquin Romero Marchent
and based on the Floyd Raye Wilson novel,

1433
02:00:13,375 --> 02:00:16,042
The Only Good Indian Is a Dead Indian.

1434
02:00:16,792 --> 02:00:19,417
And his fourth, a Spaghetti secret agent,

1435
02:00:19,459 --> 02:00:23,459
James Bond rip-off-type flick called
Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!,

1436
02:00:23,542 --> 02:00:25,209
directed by Antonio Margheriti.

1437
02:01:07,667 --> 02:01:11,417
Ultimately making
Rick's six-month Italian sojourn fairly profitable,

1438
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:15,626
although his swank Roman apartment ate up
a big chunk of his earnings.

1439
02:01:17,334 --> 02:01:20,500
So as Rick returns to Hollywood via Pan Am,

1440
02:01:20,584 --> 02:01:24,042
he has four new movies under his belt,
some money in his pocket,

1441
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:29,209
and his brand-spanking-new Italian wife,
starlet Francesca Cappucci.

1442
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,918
Hurtling through the air towards a new life
and uncertain future,

1443
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,209
Rick was really not sure about
what lay ahead for him.

1444
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:46,250
Way back in coach,
working on his bottomless Bloody Mary,

1445
02:01:46,334 --> 02:01:49,334
Cliff Booth returned to Los Angeles as well.

1446
02:01:50,042 --> 02:01:54,542
He kept Rick company
during his entire six-month stay in Italy.

1447
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:59,667
However, as the two men return home,
they've come to an understanding.

1448
02:01:59,751 --> 02:02:01,167
Well, here it goes now.

1449
02:02:02,667 --> 02:02:03,709
With the...

1450
02:02:05,125 --> 02:02:06,626
With the new wife, I...

1451
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,792
I just I can't afford you anymore, Cliff.

1452
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:12,042
You know?

1453
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:14,667
I can barely afford my
own house anymore.

1454
02:02:14,751 --> 02:02:17,459
So I think the plan is to sell the house

1455
02:02:17,542 --> 02:02:21,375
and buy a condo in Toluca Lake, bank the money.

1456
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:23,542
You know, live off it. That type of thing.

1457
02:02:24,209 --> 02:02:27,125
Hopefully, I score come next pilot season.

1458
02:02:27,209 --> 02:02:28,417
That's a good plan.

1459
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:29,542
Yeah.

1460
02:02:29,626 --> 02:02:30,584
You know,

1461
02:02:30,667 --> 02:02:33,083
by then, I'll know if I have a career or not,

1462
02:02:33,167 --> 02:02:37,083
if I'm a solid Los Angeles citizen
like Eddie O'Brien says,

1463
02:02:37,167 --> 02:02:41,250
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

1464
02:02:41,667 --> 02:02:44,918
So when this whole European journey is over,

1465
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,209
I think we've...

1466
02:02:47,834 --> 02:02:50,334
We've reached the end of the trail, Cliff.

1467
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:05,000
So these last four Italian flicks,
after nine years together,

1468
02:03:05,083 --> 02:03:08,209
would be Rick and Cliff's final rodeo.

1469
02:03:08,292 --> 02:03:11,042
Cliff doesn't have a clue what he's gonna do.

1470
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:13,292
The only thing the two men know of for sure:

1471
02:03:13,375 --> 02:03:17,000
Tonight, Rick and Cliff
will have a good old-fashioned drunk.

1472
02:03:17,083 --> 02:03:20,250
Both men know,
once the plane touches down in El Segundo,

1473
02:03:20,334 --> 02:03:22,751
it'll be the end of an era for both of them.

1474
02:03:22,876 --> 02:03:25,209
And when you come to
the end of the line with a buddy

1475
02:03:25,292 --> 02:03:27,918
who is more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,

1476
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,167
getting blind drunk together
is really the only way to say farewell.

1477
02:04:28,918 --> 02:04:30,209
Here it is, honey.

1478
02:04:31,751 --> 02:04:33,250
- You like it?
- I love it.

1479
02:04:44,792 --> 02:04:46,083
Where do you want it?

1480
02:04:50,751 --> 02:04:51,792
Hello?

1481
02:04:51,876 --> 02:04:53,459
Hey, it's Joanna and the baby.

1482
02:04:53,542 --> 02:04:55,209
Hi! Come on up.

1483
02:05:01,542 --> 02:05:02,584
Hi!

1484
02:05:02,667 --> 02:05:05,459
Oh, honey. How are you?

1485
02:05:05,542 --> 02:05:07,792
- Oh, my gosh, you're about to pop!
- I know!

1486
02:05:07,876 --> 02:05:09,500
I know.

1487
02:05:09,584 --> 02:05:11,167
And this is the nursery.

1488
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:13,918
- Oh, my God, Sharon. It's perfect.
- Do you love it?

1489
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,250
Little shoes!

1490
02:05:15,334 --> 02:05:16,626
I know.

1491
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:20,209
I'm about to burst.

1492
02:05:20,292 --> 02:05:22,626
- I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.
- Thank you.

1493
02:05:39,209 --> 02:05:40,959
- Thanks, Gillian.
- Bye!

1494
02:05:41,042 --> 02:05:42,459
Bye, Brandy!

1495
02:05:46,959 --> 02:05:49,959
Sharon had two friends move
into the Cielo Drive residence

1496
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:52,751
while Roman was in London
preparing his next movie:

1497
02:05:52,834 --> 02:05:56,250
Voytek Frykowski,
an old friend of Roman's from Poland,

1498
02:05:56,334 --> 02:05:59,000
and his girlfriend, social worker Abigail Folger,

1499
02:05:59,083 --> 02:06:01,542
heiress to the vast Folger coffee empire.

1500
02:06:43,584 --> 02:06:47,209
That night, Sharon, her two houseguests
and, naturally, Jay...

1501
02:06:47,334 --> 02:06:52,042
all went to the West Hollywood Mexican restaurant
landmark El Coyote, on Beverly, for dinner.

1502
02:06:56,792 --> 02:06:59,209
What's going on at the dirty movie place?

1503
02:06:59,292 --> 02:07:01,042
Oh, they're having a premiere.

1504
02:07:01,125 --> 02:07:02,792
Dirty movies have premieres?

1505
02:07:02,876 --> 02:07:04,584
Yeah. They're fun.

1506
02:07:05,292 --> 02:07:06,959
- This place is always so busy.
- I know.

1507
02:07:07,042 --> 02:07:08,500
It's crazy in here.

1508
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,626
And right here for you.

1509
02:07:16,918 --> 02:07:18,918
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

1510
02:07:20,834 --> 02:07:22,918
While closer to 8:30, Rick and Cliff went

1511
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,918
to the Valley Mexican restaurant landmark
Casa Vega on Ventura.

1512
02:07:32,459 --> 02:07:33,834
Hello. Welcome.

1513
02:07:35,709 --> 02:07:36,918
You're welcome, sir.

1514
02:07:47,792 --> 02:07:50,459
Well, well, well, if it ain't the cobra himself.

1515
02:07:50,542 --> 02:07:52,042
- Hey, Doug. What's happening?
- Hey, Rick.

1516
02:07:52,125 --> 02:07:54,626
- How you doing? It's good to see you.
- How's the wife doing?

1517
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:57,417
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1518
02:08:00,584 --> 02:08:02,459
Brandy stayed behind at Rick's house,

1519
02:08:02,542 --> 02:08:05,209
guarding the beautiful
Italian woman asleep in her bed

1520
02:08:05,292 --> 02:08:08,042
and waiting for Cliff and Rick to come home...

1521
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:11,709
while jet-lagged Francesca slept.

1522
02:08:15,292 --> 02:08:16,751
But you just get paid for the day

1523
02:08:16,834 --> 02:08:18,542
- that you cut his hair, though, right?
- No, no, no.

1524
02:08:18,626 --> 02:08:20,417
I get paid $1000 a day.

1525
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:22,667
I get paid $1000 the day I arrive.

1526
02:08:22,751 --> 02:08:24,584
- I get paid $1000...
- At El Coyote,

1527
02:08:24,667 --> 02:08:28,459
margaritas and good times were had by all,
except Sharon.

1528
02:08:28,542 --> 02:08:32,250
Sharon was experiencing
a touch of pregnancy-induced melancholy.

1529
02:08:32,334 --> 02:08:36,250
Not only that, it was later reported
that it was the hottest night of the year,

1530
02:08:36,334 --> 02:08:39,417
and it made her feel especially pregnant
in all the worst ways.

1531
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:42,000
I don't want to party anymore. I am tired.

1532
02:08:42,417 --> 02:08:44,042
Because he got it done.

1533
02:08:44,125 --> 02:08:46,876
No, it's not--
It's not because he just got it done.

1534
02:08:46,959 --> 02:08:50,125
He had just as much time
as all the rest of the goddamn directors.

1535
02:08:50,209 --> 02:08:52,584
But it's what he did with that time--
That's what counted.

1536
02:08:52,667 --> 02:08:55,083
At Casa Vega, Rick and Cliff drank so much that,

1537
02:08:55,167 --> 02:08:58,626
when they left, they left the Cadillac there
and took a cab home.

1538
02:08:58,709 --> 02:09:00,500
The greatest action director,

1539
02:09:00,584 --> 02:09:03,000
underrated guy of all time.

1540
02:09:04,042 --> 02:09:08,709
Around 10, Sharon and her friends left El Coyote
and arrived back at her house.

1541
02:09:16,918 --> 02:09:20,792
You've had, like, 19 margaritas.

1542
02:09:22,584 --> 02:09:26,959
The four of them hung out a little while longer,
with Abigail even playing the piano for them...

1543
02:09:27,042 --> 02:09:31,167
Don't get me mad
Don't tell no lie

1544
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:36,209
Don't make me sad
Don't pass me by

1545
02:09:38,959 --> 02:09:41,334
Baby, are you holding

1546
02:09:41,417 --> 02:09:45,918
Holding anything but me?

1547
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:51,459
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
If you know what I mean

1548
02:09:52,834 --> 02:09:56,584
You can bring me love
You can hang around

1549
02:09:56,667 --> 02:09:58,584
You can bring me up

1550
02:09:58,667 --> 02:10:03,459
Don't you bring me down

1551
02:10:03,542 --> 02:10:07,375
...until she returned to her room,
smoked a joint and read a book.

1552
02:10:07,459 --> 02:10:08,959
That was around 11.

1553
02:10:28,375 --> 02:10:33,000
At more or less the same time,
Voytek laid on the couch watching American television

1554
02:10:33,083 --> 02:10:37,626
and thought about how much better it was
than Polish television, as he smoked a big joint.

1555
02:10:39,292 --> 02:10:43,209
Somewhere around 11:10,
Sharon changed into her comfy house attire.

1556
02:10:43,292 --> 02:10:44,375
Feel better?

1557
02:10:45,292 --> 02:10:47,709
That is drastically better.

1558
02:10:49,667 --> 02:10:53,626
It was after 11:45 by the time
the yellow cab dropped Rick and Cliff

1559
02:10:53,709 --> 02:10:55,500
in front of the house.

1560
02:10:55,584 --> 02:10:56,834
Thank you. Right here.

1561
02:10:56,918 --> 02:10:58,751
All right. Grazie, amigo.

1562
02:11:00,292 --> 02:11:02,667
- How much do I owe you?
- Three dollars.

1563
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:04,751
Brandy was glad to see them return.

1564
02:11:04,834 --> 02:11:06,709
- Thank you, brother.
- Thanks.

1565
02:11:06,792 --> 02:11:09,000
Andiamo. More margaritas.

1566
02:11:14,834 --> 02:11:18,500
Around midnight,
a completely drunk Rick Dalton started making

1567
02:11:18,584 --> 02:11:20,667
a blender of frozen margaritas.

1568
02:11:23,417 --> 02:11:24,417
All right.

1569
02:11:26,167 --> 02:11:27,292
We're walking.

1570
02:11:27,375 --> 02:11:31,542
At the same time, Cliff was attaching a leash
to an excited Brandy's dog collar.

1571
02:11:31,626 --> 02:11:32,500
I know.

1572
02:11:38,167 --> 02:11:39,876
I remember you.

1573
02:11:40,334 --> 02:11:44,083
- A cigarette dipped in acid. What's that do?
- You smoke it. It gets you high.

1574
02:11:44,167 --> 02:11:46,250
- How much?
- Fifty cents.

1575
02:11:48,209 --> 02:11:49,292
Fifty cents.

1576
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:51,542
Hippie girl, 50 cents.

1577
02:11:55,209 --> 02:11:56,584
Tonight the night?

1578
02:11:58,042 --> 02:11:59,167
Why not?

1579
02:12:22,709 --> 02:12:25,209
And away we go.

1580
02:12:27,292 --> 02:12:31,584
Our Polish friend said it was
the hottest day of the year.

1581
02:12:31,667 --> 02:12:35,417
Despite the fact that he said it,
actually, it might be true.

1582
02:13:56,626 --> 02:13:57,667
Goddamn.

1583
02:13:58,792 --> 02:14:00,792
Fucking private road.

1584
02:14:00,876 --> 02:14:03,417
Damn property taxes up the butt.

1585
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:04,792
Goddamn.

1586
02:14:12,125 --> 02:14:15,709
Bunch of goddamn fucking hippies.

1587
02:14:15,792 --> 02:14:18,209
What the fuck?

1588
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:22,459
Hey, you!

1589
02:14:23,918 --> 02:14:27,083
Yeah, asshole, I'm talking to you!

1590
02:14:28,167 --> 02:14:31,250
What the hell do you think you're doing
bringing that noisy hunk of shit

1591
02:14:31,334 --> 02:14:33,417
around here at midnight?

1592
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:36,209
This is a private road, all right?

1593
02:14:36,292 --> 02:14:38,876
Who are you? And who are you here to see?

1594
02:14:38,959 --> 02:14:39,584
Nobody, sir.

1595
02:14:39,667 --> 02:14:41,667
We just got lost and a little turned around.

1596
02:14:41,751 --> 02:14:43,375
Horseshit.

1597
02:14:45,626 --> 02:14:49,584
You fucking hippies came up here
to smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

1598
02:14:49,667 --> 02:14:52,334
Next time you want to try that,
fix your fucking muffler.

1599
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:56,500
- Look, we're really sorry we disturbed you.
- Look, chief, you don't belong here.

1600
02:14:56,584 --> 02:15:01,542
Now, take this mechanical asshole
and get it off my fucking street!

1601
02:15:13,959 --> 02:15:14,792
Hey!

1602
02:15:15,542 --> 02:15:18,292
Dennis Hopper! Move this fucking piece of shit!

1603
02:15:18,375 --> 02:15:20,792
All right.
Just give me a moment to turn it around.

1604
02:15:20,876 --> 02:15:22,667
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

1605
02:15:22,751 --> 02:15:26,417
- but fucking drive it, and drive it now!
- Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1606
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:28,083
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1607
02:15:31,918 --> 02:15:35,626
The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?

1608
02:15:35,709 --> 02:15:38,459
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1609
02:15:45,292 --> 02:15:46,792
Dirty fucking hippies.

1610
02:16:00,459 --> 02:16:02,834
There in his fancy fucking house,
thinking he's handled it.

1611
02:16:02,918 --> 02:16:05,959
But he's seen us. He's awake. He's alert.

1612
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:07,250
They're all awake.

1613
02:16:07,334 --> 02:16:09,292
They're listening to fucking records.

1614
02:16:09,375 --> 02:16:10,918
Everybody's fucking awake!

1615
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,167
Look!

1616
02:16:12,250 --> 02:16:14,334
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

1617
02:16:14,876 --> 02:16:18,500
"Go to Terry's old house
and kill everybody in there."

1618
02:16:19,042 --> 02:16:20,876
And you heard him yourself.

1619
02:16:20,959 --> 02:16:22,751
He said, "Make it witchy."

1620
02:16:22,834 --> 02:16:25,876
Now, he either said that,

1621
02:16:25,959 --> 02:16:27,792
or I'm a liar.

1622
02:16:29,042 --> 02:16:32,292
Now, are any one of you calling me a liar?

1623
02:16:35,042 --> 02:16:36,459
How about you?

1624
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,542
Are you calling me a liar?

1625
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:42,083
No, of course not.

1626
02:16:42,167 --> 02:16:43,042
Good.

1627
02:16:43,125 --> 02:16:44,542
Hold it.

1628
02:16:44,626 --> 02:16:47,125
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

1629
02:16:47,209 --> 02:16:48,459
The guy from Bounty Law.

1630
02:16:48,542 --> 02:16:50,292
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

1631
02:16:50,375 --> 02:16:52,792
That guy in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1632
02:16:53,417 --> 02:16:56,584
Wait a minute. That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at me?

1633
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:59,167
He was older, but, yeah, I think so.

1634
02:16:59,250 --> 02:17:02,334
- So who's this Rick guy?
- Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together.

1635
02:17:02,459 --> 02:17:05,709
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a cowboy show
in the '50s called Bounty Law.

1636
02:17:06,167 --> 02:17:07,626
Fuck you, Katie.

1637
02:17:07,709 --> 02:17:11,000
Sorry I don't know the name
of every fascist on TV in the '50s.

1638
02:17:11,083 --> 02:17:15,584
I can't believe
that asshole in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1639
02:17:15,667 --> 02:17:18,500
When I was a kid, I had a Bounty Law lunch box.

1640
02:17:18,584 --> 02:17:21,209
That was my favorite of all my lunch boxes.

1641
02:17:22,209 --> 02:17:24,959
Dig this!

1642
02:17:25,042 --> 02:17:29,792
When we've been having our trip sessions,
I've been expanding on this one idea in my head.

1643
02:17:29,876 --> 02:17:33,459
All right, dig it. We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

1644
02:17:34,959 --> 02:17:38,667
And if you grew up watching TV,
that means you grew up watching murder.

1645
02:17:39,626 --> 02:17:44,167
Every show on TV
that wasn't I Love Lucy was about murder.

1646
02:17:44,250 --> 02:17:47,334
So my idea is...

1647
02:17:47,417 --> 02:17:49,834
we kill the people who taught us to kill.

1648
02:17:51,834 --> 02:17:56,000
I mean, where the fuck are we, man?
We are in fucking Hollywood, man.

1649
02:17:56,083 --> 02:17:59,751
The people an entire generation grew up
watching kill people live here.

1650
02:17:59,834 --> 02:18:02,209
And they live in pig-shit fucking luxury.

1651
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:03,334
I say fuck them.

1652
02:18:03,417 --> 02:18:05,417
I say we cut their cocks off and make them eat it.

1653
02:18:06,334 --> 02:18:08,375
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1654
02:18:10,709 --> 02:18:12,500
You two ready to kill some piggies'?

1655
02:18:21,918 --> 02:18:24,167
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1656
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:28,584
Sorry, I forgot my knife in the car. Can I go--?
Can I go back and get it?

1657
02:18:29,667 --> 02:18:31,000
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1658
02:18:31,083 --> 02:18:32,167
Go on. Wait a minute.

1659
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:35,334
- What?
- I locked the car. You'll need keys to get in.

1660
02:18:39,626 --> 02:18:41,542
Right. Thank you.

1661
02:18:41,626 --> 02:18:44,292
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1662
02:18:44,375 --> 02:18:47,417
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

1663
02:18:57,584 --> 02:18:59,334
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1664
02:18:59,417 --> 02:19:02,250
Calm down. There's a fucking house right there.

1665
02:19:03,626 --> 02:19:06,209
- What do we do now?
- We do what we came to do.

1666
02:19:06,292 --> 02:19:08,417
And when we're done, we split up and hitch home.

1667
02:19:09,209 --> 02:19:10,542
Any more questions?

1668
02:19:13,709 --> 02:19:16,542
Okay, pig killers, let's kill some piggies.

1669
02:19:17,042 --> 02:19:17,918
All right.

1670
02:19:30,584 --> 02:19:32,292
Oh, someone's hungry.

1671
02:19:41,125 --> 02:19:42,334
All right.

1672
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:45,792
It's feeding time.

1673
02:19:49,042 --> 02:19:50,250
Brandy, couch.

1674
02:19:56,834 --> 02:19:58,292
And don't you mo--

1675
02:20:06,709 --> 02:20:08,042
Oh, man.

1676
02:20:17,751 --> 02:20:19,876
The train has left the station.

1677
02:20:26,709 --> 02:20:28,042
Bad idea.

1678
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,375
Eighty men died

1679
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:51,209
On the countryside

1680
02:21:51,584 --> 02:21:53,417
Ten, 20, 30, 40

1681
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:55,000
Fifty or more

1682
02:21:55,083 --> 02:21:58,417
The bloody Red Baron
Was rollin' up the score

1683
02:22:17,459 --> 02:22:20,667
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

1684
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:21,959
All right? Go.

1685
02:23:09,584 --> 02:23:10,959
Hey.

1686
02:23:13,918 --> 02:23:18,000
I am doing the best I can under the circumstances.

1687
02:23:18,083 --> 02:23:20,292
Now, I do not want to get into it tonight.

1688
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:32,542
Can I help you?

1689
02:23:38,834 --> 02:23:39,959
Shit.

1690
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:43,125
How many other people are here?

1691
02:23:43,209 --> 02:23:46,042
Oh, just the one sleeping in the back there.

1692
02:23:47,542 --> 02:23:49,751
Go get him and bring him into the living room.

1693
02:23:50,751 --> 02:23:53,209
- What if he says no?
- Don't take no for an answer.

1694
02:23:53,292 --> 02:23:55,459
You're the one with the knife. Get him in here!

1695
02:23:58,167 --> 02:23:59,083
Hey.

1696
02:24:05,042 --> 02:24:06,918
You are real, right?

1697
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,667
I'm as real as a doughnut, motherfucker.

1698
02:24:19,542 --> 02:24:20,667
What the fuck?

1699
02:24:28,334 --> 02:24:31,083
- Go to the living room.
- What is going on, huh?

1700
02:24:36,042 --> 02:24:37,834
- Go!
- Si, si.

1701
02:24:40,083 --> 02:24:41,500
Who the fuck's that?

1702
02:24:41,584 --> 02:24:42,584
I don't know.

1703
02:24:43,876 --> 02:24:44,959
Francesca.

1704
02:24:54,417 --> 02:24:55,334
What--?

1705
02:24:56,417 --> 02:24:58,083
Oh, I know you.

1706
02:24:58,167 --> 02:25:00,000
I know all three of you.

1707
02:25:01,209 --> 02:25:03,167
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

1708
02:25:03,876 --> 02:25:05,918
Spahn Ranch. Yeah.

1709
02:25:08,083 --> 02:25:11,542
I don't know your name, but I remember that hair.

1710
02:25:12,125 --> 02:25:15,667
And you, I remember your white little face.

1711
02:25:15,751 --> 02:25:17,709
And you were on a horsie.

1712
02:25:18,209 --> 02:25:19,167
Yeah.

1713
02:25:21,292 --> 02:25:22,250
You are...?

1714
02:25:22,876 --> 02:25:24,751
I'm the devil,

1715
02:25:24,834 --> 02:25:27,667
and I'm here to do the devil's business.

1716
02:25:30,876 --> 02:25:32,918
Nah, it was dumber than that.

1717
02:25:32,959 --> 02:25:34,542
Something like... Rex.

1718
02:25:34,626 --> 02:25:36,667
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

1719
02:25:40,167 --> 02:25:41,334
Fuck!

1720
02:25:56,375 --> 02:25:57,876
Son of a bitch!

1721
02:26:36,375 --> 02:26:37,209
Hey, you.

1722
02:26:40,209 --> 02:26:42,417
How dare you come into my house, motherfucker!

1723
02:27:08,459 --> 02:27:10,250
Wow, man.

1724
02:28:03,292 --> 02:28:04,459
What the fuck?

1725
02:28:05,918 --> 02:28:07,542
Jesus Christ.

1726
02:29:24,209 --> 02:29:25,709
Holy shit.

1727
02:29:28,667 --> 02:29:31,584
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

1728
02:29:51,375 --> 02:29:53,751
- 10,000 block, Cielo Drive.
- Sir, around what time was it

1729
02:29:53,834 --> 02:29:55,834
when you confronted the intruder?

1730
02:29:55,918 --> 02:29:58,083
It was about midnight.

1731
02:29:58,167 --> 02:29:59,250
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

1732
02:29:59,334 --> 02:30:00,834
How do you know it was midnight?

1733
02:30:00,918 --> 02:30:03,834
Well, I was in the kitchen.

1734
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:06,918
You know, I was making margaritas, and...

1735
02:30:07,834 --> 02:30:09,834
I heard the sound of a noisy muffler.

1736
02:30:09,918 --> 02:30:11,375
I looked up at the clock.

1737
02:30:11,459 --> 02:30:13,626
It said... The kitchen clock said midnight.

1738
02:30:13,709 --> 02:30:17,417
- Twelve o'clock exactly?
- I mean, it could have been 12:05.

1739
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:19,667
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

1740
02:30:19,751 --> 02:30:22,125
until the woman attacked you in the pool.

1741
02:30:22,209 --> 02:30:23,626
No, no.

1742
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:26,334
So, what did these perpetrators do?

1743
02:30:26,417 --> 02:30:29,042
Perpetrators? They were hippie assholes.

1744
02:30:29,167 --> 02:30:32,667
Two of them burst through the front door there,

1745
02:30:32,751 --> 02:30:37,083
and the guy hippie said he was the devil.

1746
02:30:37,167 --> 02:30:39,918
And he said, "I'm here to..."

1747
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,167
"do some devil shit."

1748
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:44,876
Or... That's not verbatim, but...

1749
02:30:44,959 --> 02:30:47,792
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

1750
02:31:01,876 --> 02:31:04,000
And away we go.

1751
02:31:07,083 --> 02:31:09,250
Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1752
02:31:09,334 --> 02:31:10,918
What hospital you going to, Cliff?

1753
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,292
I'll meet you there, huh?

1754
02:31:12,375 --> 02:31:14,918
You don't want to meet me in no hospital.

1755
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,792
Why don't you go take care of your lady.

1756
02:31:16,876 --> 02:31:19,876
Hey, she just took five fucking sleeping pills.

1757
02:31:19,959 --> 02:31:21,918
She'll be asleep till Columbus Day.

1758
02:31:22,042 --> 02:31:25,459
These guys will probably have to come out here again
just to wake her ass up.

1759
02:31:25,542 --> 02:31:28,709
Hey, I'm not gonna die.
I may get a limp, but I ain't gonna die.

1760
02:31:28,792 --> 02:31:30,751
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

1761
02:31:30,876 --> 02:31:36,459
So no use waiting in some waiting room.
Why don't you go lie naked with that fine creature.

1762
02:31:36,542 --> 02:31:38,083
Come visit me tomorrow.

1763
02:31:38,167 --> 02:31:39,542
Bring bagels.

1764
02:31:40,834 --> 02:31:42,959
You want to do something for me, check on Brandy.

1765
02:31:43,042 --> 02:31:46,042
She may be a little shook up after that.
She may want to sleep with you.

1766
02:31:46,125 --> 02:31:49,334
Are you kidding me?
She's sleeping with Francesca right now.

1767
02:31:49,417 --> 02:31:51,500
You might never get her back.

1768
02:31:51,584 --> 02:31:53,292
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

1769
02:31:53,375 --> 02:31:55,792
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

1770
02:31:59,209 --> 02:32:00,834
Hey. Hey.

1771
02:32:04,667 --> 02:32:06,459
You're a good friend, Cliff.

1772
02:32:07,918 --> 02:32:09,125
I try.

1773
02:32:41,500 --> 02:32:42,459
Hello?

1774
02:32:44,459 --> 02:32:45,292
Hey.

1775
02:32:45,375 --> 02:32:48,167
I'm Jay Sebring. I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

1776
02:32:48,709 --> 02:32:51,292
You're Rick Dalton, right?

1777
02:32:51,375 --> 02:32:54,250
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

1778
02:32:55,042 --> 02:32:56,876
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

1779
02:32:56,959 --> 02:32:59,709
I tease Sharon that she
lives next door to Jake Cahill.

1780
02:32:59,834 --> 02:33:03,584
If she ever wants to put a bounty on Roman's head,
she just has to go next door, right?

1781
02:33:05,292 --> 02:33:06,500
No shit.

1782
02:33:07,125 --> 02:33:09,500
What the fuck happened?

1783
02:33:09,584 --> 02:33:12,167
Oh, these fucking hippie weirdos,

1784
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:14,542
they broke into my house.

1785
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:17,334
What do you mean, like, trying to rob you?

1786
02:33:17,417 --> 02:33:19,209
We don't know what the fuck they wanted.

1787
02:33:19,292 --> 02:33:23,334
Were they robbing me? I don't know.
Were they freaking out on some bummer trip?

1788
02:33:23,417 --> 02:33:26,751
Who knows?
But they tried to kill my wife and my buddy.

1789
02:33:26,834 --> 02:33:30,250
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

1790
02:33:30,334 --> 02:33:34,042
Now, my buddy and his dog killed two of them, and then...

1791
02:33:34,125 --> 02:33:37,167
Well, shit. I torched the last one.

1792
02:33:37,250 --> 02:33:38,250
"Torched"?

1793
02:33:38,334 --> 02:33:41,584
Yeah. I burnt her ass to a crisp.

1794
02:33:41,667 --> 02:33:44,584
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I--

1795
02:33:44,667 --> 02:33:48,751
- I got a flamethrower in my toolshed.
- Oh, from The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

1796
02:33:49,626 --> 02:33:51,417
Yeah!

1797
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:53,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1798
02:33:53,083 --> 02:33:54,667
That's the one.

1799
02:33:54,751 --> 02:33:57,167
Yeah, it still works too. Thank God.

1800
02:33:58,125 --> 02:33:59,500
Is everybody okay?

1801
02:33:59,584 --> 02:34:03,959
Well, the fucking hippies aren't,
that's for goddamn sure.

1802
02:34:04,042 --> 02:34:05,626
Yeah. But I'm fine.

1803
02:34:05,709 --> 02:34:07,459
You know, my wife's fine.

1804
02:34:07,542 --> 02:34:11,918
- We're just a little shook up, is all.
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.

1805
02:34:12,667 --> 02:34:13,876
Yeah.

1806
02:34:13,959 --> 02:34:16,709
Jay, honey, is everything all right?

1807
02:34:16,792 --> 02:34:18,792
Everything's okay now, honey.

1808
02:34:18,876 --> 02:34:21,667
But some hippies broke into the house next door.

1809
02:34:21,751 --> 02:34:23,584
Oh, my God.

1810
02:34:23,667 --> 02:34:25,667
Oh, that's terrifying.

1811
02:34:25,751 --> 02:34:27,292
Is everybody okay?

1812
02:34:27,375 --> 02:34:31,292
I'm talking to your
next-door neighbor about it right now.

1813
02:34:31,375 --> 02:34:32,876
Rick Dalton?

1814
02:34:34,542 --> 02:34:36,375
Yeah, that's me.

1815
02:34:38,042 --> 02:34:39,500
Well, hello, neighbor.

1816
02:34:40,542 --> 02:34:42,334
Is everybody okay?

1817
02:34:42,417 --> 02:34:45,417
Yes, Sharon, everybody's fine.

1818
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:47,000
Are you okay?

1819
02:34:49,167 --> 02:34:51,375
Well, yes, I am. Thank you for asking that.

1820
02:34:52,459 --> 02:34:56,417
Rick, would you like to come up to the house
for a drink and meet my other friends?

1821
02:35:02,918 --> 02:35:05,000
Yeah, sure.

1822
02:35:05,083 --> 02:35:06,000
Thank you.

1823
02:35:07,250 --> 02:35:08,959
Great. I'll buzz you up.

1824
02:35:20,918 --> 02:35:22,125
Come on.

1825
02:35:25,209 --> 02:35:27,417
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

1826
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:28,959
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

1827
02:35:29,042 --> 02:35:31,292
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay. Pleasure's all mine.

1828
02:35:31,375 --> 02:35:33,626
Sounds like you had a hell of a night.

1829
02:38:52,292 --> 02:38:56,709
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,
better known as bounty hunter Jake Cahill,

1830
02:38:56,792 --> 02:39:00,250
speaking on behalf of Red Apple cigarettes.

1831
02:39:00,334 --> 02:39:03,500
Now, I smoke Red Apples. Been smoking them for years.

1832
02:39:03,584 --> 02:39:08,542
But since the Red Apple tobacco company's
been around since 1862,

1833
02:39:08,626 --> 02:39:11,876
you'll see Jake Cahill smoke Red Apple too.

1834
02:39:12,209 --> 02:39:17,083
Now, back in Jake's day, Red Apple came in a pouch,
and he had to roll his own.

1835
02:39:17,167 --> 02:39:20,125
But today, Red Apple comes factory-rolled.

1836
02:39:20,209 --> 02:39:23,834
For the best drag with the best tobacco flavor,

1837
02:39:23,918 --> 02:39:28,542
with less burn on your throat
than any other non-filtered cigarette.

1838
02:39:37,876 --> 02:39:40,542
Now, that's the way a cigarette should taste.

1839
02:39:41,542 --> 02:39:44,417
Better drag, more flavor,

1840
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:46,000
less throat burn.

1841
02:39:48,292 --> 02:39:50,042
That's the Red Apple way.

1842
02:39:51,042 --> 02:39:54,751
So, look for this life-size standee of me, Jake Cahill,

1843
02:39:54,834 --> 02:39:58,459
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco products are sold.

1844
02:39:58,542 --> 02:40:01,792
Take a bite and feel all right.

1845
02:40:01,876 --> 02:40:05,209
Take a bite of a Red Apple.

1846
02:40:05,292 --> 02:40:06,792
Tell them Jake sent you.

1847
02:40:10,292 --> 02:40:12,834
- And cut.
- All right, this cigarette tastes like fucking shit.

1848
02:40:12,918 --> 02:40:16,250
And, by the way, who chose this photo?
I have a double chin. All right?

1849
02:40:16,334 --> 02:40:18,000
Nobody notices that crap?
