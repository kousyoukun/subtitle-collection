early today,

00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:35,516
and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

170
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,349
Jody Janice,

171
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,853
wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

172
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:43,190
$425 dead or alive.

173
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,793
And you brought him here
to collect.

174
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,529
I don't even know where here is.

175
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,731
It was just the closest place.

176
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,667
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

177
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,736
So, bounty killer,

178
00:09:56,869 --> 00:10:00,240
the name of this town
is Janicetown.

179
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,310
And that boy you killed...

180
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:07,680
was Jody Janice.

181
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:11,851
He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

182
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,786
Hmm.

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,072
Did a, ahem, Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

204
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:41,108
I did a <i>Land of the Giants.</i>
<i>Green Hornet.</i>

205
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,110
I did that show, uh...

00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,512
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid
Scott Brown. Yeah.

207
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,916

that-that airs this Sunday.

pulled by the networks.

- Mm-hm.
- Right?

218
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,315
So you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

219
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,483
You wanna build up
his bona fides, right?

220
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,820
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show

221
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,488
- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

222
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,757
Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

223
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,694
it's hero besting heavy.

224
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:36,329
But what the audience sees

225
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:41,334
is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

226
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,002
- Uh-huh.
- You see?

227
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:46,406
Then next week, it's Ron Ely.

228
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,876
And next week, it's Bob Conrad,

229
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,912

like fighting?

685
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:22,307
Well, I feel like
fucking fighting

686
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:24,508
because I've been up here
by myself

687
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,213

don't you?

697

Yeah.

Steer clear of her.

699
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:08,520
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

700
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:10,889
What I admire is, in his sport,

701
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:13,257
there's an element
of true combat.

702
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,927
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

703
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,263
that's not two athletes
posturing.

704
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:20,265
That's combat.

705
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:23,567
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

706
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:25,736
If you don't beat him...

707
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,939
he kills you.

708
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,674
That's beyond athletics.

709
00:44:29,808 --> 00:44:33,378
That's beyond
<i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

710
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:35,379
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

711
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:37,949
That's what I admire.

712
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:39,417
In martial arts tournaments,

713
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,119
they won't let you fight
like that.

714
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:43,254
It's very frustrating.

715
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:44,689
You stand in front of a guy,

716
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:47,625
and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

717
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,294
But you can't.

718
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:53,363
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

719
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:56,600
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

720
00:44:56,734 --> 00:44:57,803
The colored boxer,

721
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,604
not that white
kickboxing asshole.

722
00:45:00,939 --> 00:45:03,642
They do what
they need to do to win.

723
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:05,676
They unleash as much punishment

724
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,146
as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

725
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:10,949
But in martial arts tournaments,

726
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:13,451
I do to win what they do to win.

727
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,488
I unleash all my power.

728
00:45:17,254 --> 00:45:18,922
I kill people.

But you're laughing at

746
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,468
But I'm not saying
anything funny.

747
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:06,904
So, what do you think
is so funny?

748
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:10,341
What I think is...

749
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,078
you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

750
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:16,915
and I think you
should be embarrassed

751
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:19,183
to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

752
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:22,086
on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

753
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:25,055
Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

754
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:26,857
And I would really
enjoy closing it,

755
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:29,993
especially in front
of all my friends.

756
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:33,464
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

757
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:35,866
That means, we get into a fight,

758
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,903
I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

759
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:41,639
Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

760
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:43,040
in a fight, they go to jail.

761
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:44,576
It's called manslaughter.

762
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:46,844
And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

763
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:48,479
is just an excuse so you dancers

764

never have to get
in a real fight.

Okay.

766
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:55,921
How about a friendly contest?

767
00:46:57,154 --> 00:46:59,056
No punching in the face.

768
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,725
Two out of three.

769
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,860
Who puts who
on the ground first?

770
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:07,865
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

For what?

775
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,425
Killed his wife
and got away with it.

776
00:47:33,558 --> 00:47:34,693

And I say "actor,"

is nonsensical.

and-and-and young and

933
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,147
He could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

Now he's into his, uh, late 30s

and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

playing the heavy on the pilot.

999
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:46,703
And I gotta tell you,
I came damn close

1000

to being in <i>The Fourteen</i>

I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

1004
01:02:54,977 --> 01:02:56,645
Up until two weeks
before shooting,

1005
01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:58,415
Fabian was in the part.

1006
01:02:58,549 --> 01:03:01,152
Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a <i>Virginian.</i>

1007
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:02,486
That's how I got it, so...

1008
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:03,520
Ah.

1009
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,859
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you

Was it true you almost got

the McQueen part

1013
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,700
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

1014
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:18,634
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

1015
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:21,370
Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

1016
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:22,806
Never met John Sturges.

1017
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,474
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

1018
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:27,578
I almost got the part, but...

1019
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,013
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

1020
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:32,415
I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

1021
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:34,418
a hotshot pilot.

1022
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:38,622
But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

1023
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:41,558
McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

1024
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,193
and during that brief moment,

1025
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,529
I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

1026
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:46,763
You have other plans?

1027
01:03:46,897 --> 01:03:48,098
I haven't seen Berlin yet

1028
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:49,700
from the ground or from the air,

1029
01:03:49,832 --> 01:03:52,035
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

1030
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:53,569
You and who?

1031
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:56,873
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

1032
01:03:57,006 --> 01:03:58,475
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

1033
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:00,110
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

1034
01:04:00,243 --> 01:04:01,478
That's gotta hurt.

1035
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:03,646
Yeah, well, I didn't get it,

1036
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:05,082
McQueen did it,

1037
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,585

I never had a chance.

Fuck you, Katie.

2227
02:17:07,793 --> 02:17:09,161
Sorry I don't know the name

2228

When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

02:17:18,636 --> 02:17:20,907
That was my favorite

Dig this!

2234
02:17:25,111 --> 02:17:26,979
When we've been having
our trip sessions,

2235
02:17:27,112 --> 02:17:29,649
I've been expanding
on this one idea in my head.

2236
02:17:29,782 --> 02:17:31,283
All right, dig it.

2237
02:17:31,417 --> 02:17:34,886
We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

2238
02:17:35,019 --> 02:17:36,554
And if you grew up watching TV,

2239
02:17:36,688 --> 02:17:38,558
that means you grew up
watching murder.

2240
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:39,559
Mm-hm.

2241
02:17:39,692 --> 02:17:41,327
Every show on TV

2242
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:44,196
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i>
was about murder.

2243
02:17:44,329 --> 02:17:47,366
So my idea is...

2244
02:17:47,499 --> 02:17:49,868
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

2245

I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

2247
02:17:56,176 --> 02:17:57,977
The people
an entire generation grew up

2248
02:17:58,109 --> 02:17:59,746
watching kill people live here.

2249
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:01,847
And they live
in pig-shit fucking luxury.

2250

2502
02:35:29,126 --> 02:35:30,161
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay.

2503
02:35:30,294 --> 02:35:31,428
Pleasure's all mine.

2504
02:35:31,562 --> 02:35:33,363
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

2511
02:38:54,231 --> 02:38:56,733
better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

2512
02:38:56,867 --> 02:39:00,270
speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

2513
02:39:00,403 --> 02:39:03,507
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

2514
02:39:03,641 --> 02:39:05,976
But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

2515
02:39:06,111 --> 02:39:08,579
been around since 1862,

2516
02:39:08,713 --> 02:39:11,917
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.</i>

2517
02:39:12,050 --> 02:39:15,152
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

2518
02:39:15,285 --> 02:39:17,120
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

2519
02:39:17,255 --> 02:39:20,158
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

2520
02:39:20,291 --> 02:39:23,894
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

2521
02:39:24,028 --> 02:39:25,929
with less burn on your throat

2522
02:39:26,063 --> 02:39:28,499
than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

2523
02:39:28,633 --> 02:39:29,968

2524
02:39:34,873 --> 02:39:36,174
Mm!

2525
02:39:37,942 --> 02:39:40,478
Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

2526
02:39:40,612 --> 02:39:41,479
Hm.

2527
02:39:41,613 --> 02:39:44,448
Better drag, more flavor,

2528
02:39:44,581 --> 02:39:45,983
less throat burn.

2529
02:39:48,385 --> 02:39:50,988
That's the Red Apple way.

2530
02:39:51,123 --> 02:39:54,793
So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

2531
02:39:54,926 --> 02:39:58,496
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

2532
02:39:58,630 --> 02:40:01,832
Take a bite and feel all right.

2533
02:40:01,965 --> 02:40:05,268
Take a bite of a Red Apple.

2534
02:40:05,402 --> 02:40:06,804
Tell them Jake sent you.

2535
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:11,141
{\fad(250,250)}<font color="#ca6500">DIRECTOR:</font> And cut.

2536
02:40:11,275 --> 02:40:13,077
This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

2537
02:40:13,211 --> 02:40:14,979
And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

2538
02:40:15,113 --> 02:40:16,546
I have a double chin.
All right?

2539
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:17,982
Nobody notices that crap?

2540
02:40:21,853 --> 02:40:23,755
