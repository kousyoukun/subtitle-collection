去你媽的金剛狼
Fuck Wolverine.

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:07,220
{\an8}羅根

7
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,180
首先  他也給自己的電影評R級
First, he rides my coattails with the R rating.

8
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,620
然後這個長毛混蛋竟然靠掛掉賺了一堆流量
Then the hairy motherfucker ups the ante by dying.

9
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,840
混蛋
What a dick.

10
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,100
你猜怎麼著  狼哥
Well, guess what, Wolvie?

11
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,970
這部我也要死
I'm dying in this one, too.

12
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,180
{\an8}香港

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,110
要想明白我為什麼在
To understand why I took a cat-nap

14
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,240
1200加侖高揮發性燃料上睡覺...
on 1,200 gallons of high-test fuel...

15
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,640
那我得帶你回到
I need to take you back

16
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,120
六周前的曲折故事
to the dewy slopes of six weeks ago.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,510
我走國際路線了
I'd gone international,

18
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,470
處理重要殺人犯  黑幫成員
taking out mass murderers, gangsters,

19
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,210
壞不堪言的怪物
unspeakable monsters.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,210
沒人能觸碰的人  除了我
People nobody would touch. Except me.

21
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,210
我要把他們全摸個遍
I'm gonna touch them all over.

22
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,780
我是蓋爾
Hey, it's Gail calling.

23
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,960
小西裝真帥氣
Love the shiny suit.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
讓你的雙眼更添了幾分皮條客的魅力
Really brings out the sex trafficker in your eyes.

25
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,570
{\an2}他們付你多少  我加倍

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,010
我不會說廣東話  貴...
I don't speak Cantonese, Mister...

27
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,190
我都懶得嘗試了
Well, I'm not even gonna attempt that.

28
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,710
但我初二上了西班牙語課  所以...
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...

29
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,060
{\an2}圖書館在哪裡

30
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,890
這句話的字面意義就是...
Which literally translates to...

31
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,980
我不討價還價  南瓜蠢蛋
I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker.

32
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,470
這不是吉爾伯特家
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,780
對不起
I am so sorry.

34
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,430
我以為這是肛門漂白派對
I thought this was an anal-bleaching party.

35
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,890
別擔心  你不會死的
Don't worry. You're not going to die.

36
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,020
不過這下可能會要你命
Although these will kill you.

37
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,290
上吧  寶貝
Hit it, Dolly.

38
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,960
我只是上帝的代言人
I'm merely a vessel for the Lord.

39
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,800
讓罪犯放下拿槍的手
Taking the hands out of the guns of the criminals!

40
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,210
{\an8}西西里

41
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,850
別衝我這麼做
Whoo! Do not go in there!

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,640
看看美國隊長試試這一手
Let's see Captain America do that.

43
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,760
{\an8}比洛克西

44
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,130
太異域了嗎
Too exotic?

45
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,940
{\an8}大阪

46
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,980
{\an2}我不討價還價

47
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,260
天啊  天啊  暫停  暫停
Oh, God! Oh, God, time out! Time out!

48
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,830
卡  壞蛋的血濺到人家眼睛裡了
Cut. I've got bad guy blood, right in my open eye.

49
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,880
好噁心哦
Oh, that's so gross.

50
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,180
操
Fuck.

51
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,100
看起來你還留了點空擋
Looks like you left a little landing strip there.

52
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,190
我喜歡
I like it.

53
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,930
天啊
Oh, man!

54
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,240
我的世界巡演帶我回到了家
My world tour brought me home

55
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,720
找到了這個人  謝爾蓋·瓦利什尼科夫
to this guy, Sergei Valishnikov.

56
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,760
{\an8}家  美好的家

57
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,290
但是我們等會兒再說他
But we'll get to him in a moment.

58
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,770
我知道你們都在想什麼
'Cause I know what you're thinking.

59
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,560
"還好把孩子們都安頓在家裡了"
"I'm so glad I left the kiddos at home."

60
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,300
但是你錯了
But that's where you'd be wrong.

61
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,080
你的保姆現在正嗨翻了天
That babysitter of yours is high as fuck right now...

62
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,430
以及信不信由你  《死侍2》是一部家庭電影
and, believe it or not, Deadpool 2 is a family film.

63
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,260
千真萬確
True story.

64
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,480
每一部優秀家庭電影的開頭都是一起可怕的謀殺
And every good family film starts with a vicious murder.

65
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,620
《小鹿斑比》  《獅子王》  《電鋸驚魂7》
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

66
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,970
我的上帝啊  那傢伙著火了
Holy shit pickles! That guy's on fire.

67
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,930
那可不是CG技術  夥計們  他真的著火了
That's not CGI, folks. He's actually on fire.

68
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,360
你知道我是靠抓壞蛋掙錢的吧
Yeah. You know I get paid to take out bad guys, right?

69
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,630
但是這傢伙
But this guy?

70
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,630
他是最壞的壞蛋之一
He was one of the worst of 'em.

71
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,850
趕緊把門打開
Hurry up and open this fucking door,

72
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,030
一起殺掉這混蛋
and let's kill this motherfucker!

73
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,170
真噁心
Ugh. So gross.

74
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,040
安全屋  認真的嗎
A panic room? Really?

75
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,300
你能出來嗎
Can you come out?

76
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,430
我真的得走了  今天是我的紀念日
I really have to go. It's my anniversary.

77
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,750
我總能聽到人們一遍又一遍地說
Over and over, I hear people say,

78
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,360
"我就是沒有足夠的自信"
"I just don't have enough confidence."

79
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,490
聽著  自信不是你擁有的東西
Listen, confidence is not something you have.

80
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,970
而是你創造的東西
It's something you create.

81
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,930
你隨時都能創造出來
And you can create it at any moment in time.

82
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,670
自信的感覺只不過
A sense of confidence is nothing

83
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,450
是你內心中的力量
but a sense of power within yourself...

84
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,020
讓你能夠確信你能獲得成功
a sense of certainty that you can pull something off.

85
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,150
他媽的快開車
Start the fucking car!

86
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,330
都朋德
Dopinder!

87
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,890
他媽的快開車
Start the fucking car!

88
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,070
打死那混蛋  打他
Shoot that motherfucker! Shoot him!

89
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
我嚇得拉褲子了
Oh, I shit my pants.

90
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,080
其實可能是我拉的
Actually, that may have been me.

91
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,380
任務完成了嗎
Oh, mission accomplished?

92
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,560
算是用喬治·布什的方式解決了吧
Oh, in a George W. Sort of way.

93
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,300
這混蛋沒法永遠待在安全室裡
Fucker can't stay in a panic room forever.

94
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,780
你簡直過著夢想中的生活  死先生
Oh, you're living the dreams, DP.

95
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,000
這一路都太順利了  都朋德
It has been quite the run, Dopinder,

96
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,350
誰能想到呢
and who'da thought?

97
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,830
人們提到我的時候就跟提到耶穌似的
Now I'm talked about in the same sentence as Jesus.

98
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,750
《耶穌受難記》第一  接下來就是我
Passion of the Christ, then me.

99
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,750
{\an8}《耶穌受難記》北美票房最高的R級電影
《死侍》全球票房最高的R級電影

100
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,050
至少在國內
At least domestically.

101
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,310
在國外就完全碾壓了
We beat them overseas,

102
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
畢竟他們根本沒有宗教這種東西
where there's no such thing as religion.

103
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,580
我也想過上夢想中的生活  侍侍
I do want to live the dreams, Pool Boy.

104
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,020
開出租車並沒有看上去那麼性感
Taxiing is not as sexy as it looks.

105
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,840
-我想填充我的...  -口袋嗎
- I want to fill my... - Pockets?

106
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,110
你想來點什麼  來點可卡因嗎
What's your poison? A little, uh, cokey cokey?

107
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,500
不上網點播
Can't maintain an erection

108
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,070
就會早洩嗎
without buying shoes online?

109
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,070
這個我可從來沒體驗過
I've never experienced that last one.

110
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,510
跟我說說  呆子
Talk to me, Goose.

111
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,250
我想說的是"靈魂"  我想填充我的靈魂
I was going to say "Soul". I want to fill my soul.

112
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,380
我想有所歸屬  就像你  死先生
I want to belong to something, like you, Pool, sir.

113
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,380
都朋德
Dopinder...

114
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,250
你總是能給我帶來驚喜
You never cease to surprise me.

115
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,390
你的內心是那麼的深邃
You know, the depth of your heart is extraordinary.

116
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,090
我們都需要歸屬感
We all need a sense of belonging.

117
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,910
我們都需要真切的家的感受
We all need a genuine sense of home.

118
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,090
在世界上有一個地方
A place in this world.

119
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,480
我想成為一名職業殺手
I want to become a contract killer.

120
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,350
不好意思  你說什麼
I'm sorry. What did you say?

121
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,360
你還記得我綁架了班度
Remember when I kidnapped Bandhu

122
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,700
然後極度暴力地威脅他嗎
and threatened him with great violence?

123
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,360
你差不多算是把他弄死了
You kind of killed him.

124
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,970
你記得《夜訪吸血鬼》這部電影嗎
And then remember the movie Interview with the Vampire?

125
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,190
不想記得
Don't want to.

126
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,190
當湯姆·克魯斯給10歲的克爾斯滕·鄧斯特
When Tom Cruise fed 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood

127
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,450
第一次喂血時
for the first time...

128
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,890
她看著他光滑
and she looked up at his smooth,

129
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,150
帥氣的臉龐說...
handsome face and said...

130
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,720
"我還要"
"I want some more."

131
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,420
死先生  把我想像成10歲的克爾斯滕·鄧斯特吧
Oh, Pool, picture me, a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

132
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,160
我永遠不會想不到這一幕了
I'll never not picture that.

133
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,990
但是我真希望我們能盡快
But I can't wait to never speak of this,

134
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,080
永遠不要提這件事了
as soon as possible.

135
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
我們到了
We're here.

136
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,400
都朋德  還是我
Dopinder, it's me again.

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,140
聽著  正常人可能會勸你
Look, a saner man might discourage you

138
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,050
不要加入危險的僱傭兵行業
from joining the deadly merc business...

139
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,570
畢竟看看你的小胸膛
what, with your concave chest

140
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,270
和紙板似的小胳膊
and your paper towel tube arms.

141
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,010
但是你是一隻雄鷹
But you're an eagle...

142
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
該死  雄鷹就該翱翔
and goddamn it, an eagle's gotta soar.

143
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,490
你要把握住這些夢想
You gotta grab those dreams,

144
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,150
抓住夢想的丁丁尖
grab those dreams by the dick tip...

145
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,720
讓它噴湧
and make it rain!

146
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,670
我不懂你的意思
I don't know what that means.

147
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,680
我也不懂
Me neither.

148
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,760
那麼我們...
I'm gonna see you...

149
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,420
辦公室見
at the office.

150
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,120
飛向藍天
In the sky.

151
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,290
你就是我的湯姆·克魯斯
You're my Tom Cruise!

152
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,950
你就是我的克裡斯滕·鄧斯特
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

153
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,470
克裡斯滕  克爾斯滕
Kristen? Kirsten?

154
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,130
抱歉  我遲到了
Sorry I'm late.

155
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,740
有一群
There was a bunch of

156
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,870
殘疾兒童被困在了樹上...
handicapable children stuck in a tree...

157
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,440
我得...
and I had to...

158
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,220
你沒猜錯  我其實在和一個斗篷壞蛋戰鬥
You're right. I was fighting a caped badass.

159
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,620
但是後來我們發現他的媽媽也叫瑪莎
But then we discovered his mom is named Martha, too.

160
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,620
{\an8}《蝙蝠俠大戰超人》

161
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,970
-不行  -被你抓到了
- No. - You got me.

162
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,790
我其實在把世界上所有的麵糊攪在一起
I was rounding up all the gluten in the world

163
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,060
然後射向太空
and launching it into space...

164
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,230
讓它們再也沒法傷害我們了
where it can't not hurt us ever again.

165
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,450
再編像一點
Try again.

166
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,580
腹瀉
Diarrhea?

167
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,240
總得等我把這身衣服脫下來才能肯定...
We can't be sure until I get this suit off...

168
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,280
不過所有跡象都表明的確如此
but, uh, all signs point to yes.

169
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
堵車
Traffic?

170
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,730
像你很想我一樣地親我  紅紅
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

171
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,730
趕緊過來
Well, come here.

172
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,920
我去洗個澡脫掉這身衣服
I'm gonna shower and get out of this suit.

173
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,130
你不想看看你的驚喜嗎
Don't you want your surprise?

174
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,010
我看上去像一個燒傷病人嗎
Do I look like a patient burn victim?

175
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,050
我也有給你的
I got one for you, too.

176
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,710
週年快樂  寶貝
Happy anniversary, baby.

177
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,320
打開打開打開
Open, open, open.

178
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,060
滑雪球幣
Skee-Ball token.

179
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,500
我們第一次約會
Our first date.

180
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,110
沒錯
Yup.

181
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,800
如假包換  高端工藝
That's genuine, high-grade lead.

182
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,030
我會永遠保存的
I'll keep it forever.

183
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,510
謝謝你  寶貝
Thank you, baby.

184
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,810
-打開你的  -好吧  好吧
- Open yours. - All right, all right.

185
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,300
這真是我見過最美的...
That's just the most beautiful thing that I've...

186
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,730
我不知道這是什麼玩意
I don't know what this is.

187
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,610
我的IUD[宮內節育器]
My IUD.

188
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,820
炸彈嗎
A bomb?

189
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,960
不是  笨蛋  這是我的節育裝置
No, dick for brains. My birth control device.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,090
什麼  你是說你的...
What, you mean that your...

191
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,870
造娃工廠正式開業
Baby factory's open for business.

192
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,220
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

193
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,530
我的天啊  我要個男孩
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

194
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,660
或者女孩  絕對是這倆的其中一個
Or a little girl! Definitely one or the other!

195
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,490
我還要我們的孩子只有一個名
Oh! And I want our kid to have only one name.

196
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,320
比如雪兒或陶德
Like Cher or Todd.

197
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,150
你得先給我種一顆種子  牛仔小子
You gotta pump a baby in me first, cowboy.

198
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,540
當然了
Yes, I do.

199
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,070
我們先看點小電影  再讓床嘗嘗我們的厲害
Let's watch some porn and show that bed who's boss.

200
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,110
走吧
Let's do that.

201
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,350
{\an8}猶太愛情音樂電影《楊朵》

202
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,350
*爸爸  你能聽到我嗎*
*Papa...Can you hear me*

203
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,360
*爸爸  你能聽到我嗎*
*Papa, can you hear me*

204
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,610
*爸爸  你能看到我嗎
*Papa, can you see me*

205
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,620
你覺得這首歌耳熟嗎
Does this song sound familiar to you?

206
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,520
梅
May.

207
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,260
男孩就叫康納爾  女孩就叫梅
Connor, if it's a boy. May, if it's a girl.

208
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,350
真奇怪
So weird.

209
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,790
其實本來家庭對我來說算是臟話
Family was always an F-word to me.

210
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,670
我的廢物老爹拋棄了我們
My pile of shit father took off and bailed.

211
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,930
我可能沒法成為陶德的
I mean, it's not like I have a lot of strong role models

212
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,710
道德榜樣
to draw off of for Todd.

213
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,500
看著我
Hey. Look at me.

214
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,810
你不是你父親
You are not your father.

215
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,990
再說了
Besides...

216
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,770
我絕對不會給我們的孩子起名叫陶德
I will never, ever let our child be named Todd.

217
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,820
但是事實上
But here's the thing,

218
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,690
事情不都會是那種走向嗎
isn't that how it always works?

219
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,260
就像在《星球大戰》裡
Like in Star Wars,

220
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,000
男性總會變得跟自己父親一樣
men are destined to become their father...

221
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,130
然後再和自己的姐妹自願發生性關係
and then have consensual sex with their sister?

222
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,480
我覺得你應該漏掉了很大一部分重要劇情
I think you missed big, big chunks of that movie.

223
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,790
不  盧克肯定上了她
No, I'm pretty sure Luke nailed her.

224
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,880
寶貝  那是《帝國反擊戰》裡的
Baby, that's Empire.

225
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,530
最重要的是  孩子們
The point is, kids...

226
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,670
給我們一個機會變得更好
they give us a chance to be better than we are.

227
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,150
變得比我們以前更好
Better than we used to be.

228
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,720
你比我看上去聰明多了
You're a lot smarter than I look.

229
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,420
我去做甜點
I'm gonna go make dessert.

230
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,900
你先綁上束帶  我們來造一個超級寶寶
You get the strap-on. Let's make a super baby.

231
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,340
寶寶肯定不是那樣就能造的  不過我們能試試
Pretty sure it doesn't work that way, but we can try.

232
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,910
克裡斯托呢  克開頭的
What about Krystal? But with a "K"?

233
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,910
太像脫衣舞男了
It's too stripper-y.

234
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,470
凱開頭的凱文
Kevin with a "K"!

235
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,610
不行  也太像脫衣舞男了
No, too stripper-y, too.

236
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,090
厄爾
Uh, Earl!

237
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,480
如果我們給他起名叫厄爾
He's gonna go straight to jail

238
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,740
他會直接進監獄
if we name him Earl.

239
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,660
布魯斯呢
What about Bruce?

240
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,100
不
No.

241
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,180
趴下
Get down.

242
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,620
怎麼了
What?

243
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,610
寶貝  寶貝
Baby? Baby?

244
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,570
我沒事
I'm okay.

245
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,270
謝天謝地我沒用上那個奶油乾酪磨碎機
Thank God I didn't have to use the cream cheese spreader.

246
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,130
不要
Please.

247
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,050
不要  不要
Please. Please.

248
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,270
寶貝  對不起
Baby, I'm so sorry.

249
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,100
不
No!

250
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,110
{\an8}出品
等一下

251
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,900
{\an8}製片
你剛殺了她嗎

252
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,970
{\an8}總監
我操

253
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,100
{\an8}美術設計
她簡直是大家最愛的角色

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,040
{\an8}剪輯
我回來了  祝你們好運  混蛋

255
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,880
{\an8}主演
顯然雷諾茲不想與人共享聚光燈

256
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,360
{\an8}劇本製作
都怪劇本製作  去你媽的"真英雄"

257
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,010
{\an8}攝制
真的會拍攝的傢伙

258
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,560
{\an8}導演
在《疾速追殺》裡殺死那隻狗的傢伙之一

259
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,450
*爸爸  你能聽到我嗎*
*Papa, can you hear me*

260
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:23,330
只有我覺得
Is it just me, or does

261
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,680
《冰雪奇緣》的插曲《你想堆雪人嗎》
Do You Want to Build a Snowman? From Frozen...

262
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,030
聽起來特別像
sound suspiciously like

263
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,030
《楊朵》裡的《爸爸  你能聽到我嗎》
Papa, Can You Hear Me? From Yentl?

264
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,300
*爸爸  你能聽到我嗎*
*Papa, can you hear me*

265
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,570
而根本沒有人注意到
And nobody fucking realizes it.

266
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,520
韋德  你該回家了
Wade, you gotta go home.

267
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,310
你已經在這裡坐了三天
You've been sitting here for three days, okay?

268
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,050
你聞起來像濕熱雨季扔在外面的酸菜
You smell like sauerkraut left in the warm rain.

269
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,400
泡在新鮮熱尿中的垃圾
Like wet garbage in hot urine.

270
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,620
你聞起來像一隻吃飽了用過的貓砂...
You smell like a dog ate kitty litter...

271
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,710
然後在客廳裡一路放屁的狗
and then farted his way out of the living room.

272
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,580
就像拉什·林博
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

273
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,450
拍完《鯊魚周》後坐的沙發墊
couch cushions after Shark Week.

274
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,240
我愛《冰雪奇緣》
I love Frozen.

275
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,850
我愛她  我愛她就像海洋愛著水
I loved her. I loved her like an ocean loves water.

276
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,420
海洋就是水
An ocean is water.

277
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,200
更重要的是  我喜歡她  我真的很喜歡她
More importantly, I liked her. I really liked her, you know?

278
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,380

我再也不會跳舞了  操
I'm never gonna dance again. Fuck!

281
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
他也死了
He's dead, too.

282
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,380
至少我們還有鮑威
At least we still have Bowie.

283
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,170
死先生  大衛·鮑威...
Oh, Mr. Pool. David Bowie is...

284
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,690
還活著
still with us.

285
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,610
沒錯  我們還有鮑威[卒於2016年]
We do. We'll always have Bowie.

286
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,260
對不起
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,740
一槍接一槍
Shot after shot,

288
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,610
這也改變不了事實  我覺得你就是...
it's not gonna change the fact that I think you're...

289
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,270
你在尿尿嗎  你正在撒尿嗎
Are you pissing? Are you urinating right now?

290
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,230
你在做出你尿尿時的表情
You're making the face that you make when you urinate.

291
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,840
-他在尿尿嗎  -我來
- Is he pissing? - I'm on it!

292
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,360
很好  都朋德
There you go, Dopinder.

293
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,450
如果你想成為職業殺手
If you want to be a contract killer...

294
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,060
耍槍之前  必須要先耍拖吧
you gotta handle a mop before you handle a gun.

295
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,150
只不過我並不明白
Although I don't quite understand

296
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,760
他們有什麼相似的地方
how they are at all similar.

297
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,890
因為我都能把這兩個插進你屁股裡殺了你
'Cause I could shove either one up your ass and kill you.

298
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,070
滾吧
Now, leave me.

299
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,110
我懂了
I get it.

300
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,240
回家吧  韋德
Go home, Wade.

301
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,640
我沒有家了  黃鼠狼  你懂的  我...
I don't have a home, Weas, you know. I got a...

302
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,470
我沒事
Okay, I'm fine.

303
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,640
我沒事
I'm fine.

304
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,510
你知道"沒事"是什麼意思嗎  韋德
You know what "Fine" stands for, Wade?

305
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,300
操蛋  混亂  貧窮和崩潰
Fucked up, insecure, needy, and emotional.

306
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,560
根據...

當我們在面臨巨大損失時  我們的悲傷會經歷明顯的五個階段

根據伊麗莎白·庫布勒-羅斯理論
According to the Kubler-Ross model...

310
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,090
否認只是五個階段中其中一個
denial is just one of the five stages of grief.

311
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,480
天啊  巴克
Jesus Christ, Buck!

312
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,440
還是別給你安排臺詞了
No more speaking lines for you.

313

火柴
Match?

317
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,680
有  我手上就有
Yes, I have one right here.

318
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,070
別動  搶劫
Don't make a move. This is a stick-up.

319
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,850
-什麼  -聽到了嗎
- What? - You heard me.

320
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,940
先生  先生  放下槍
Mister, Mister, put down that gun.

321
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,600
閉嘴  快點  要錢要命
Shut up. Now, come on. Your money or your life?

- Look, bud. - I said, "Your money or your life."

你來這裡幹什麼
The hell you doin' here?

327
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,010
你不知道怎麼敲門嗎
Don't you know how to knock?

328
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,970
我以為通過你的耳朵
I thought you saw me...

329
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,540
看到我了
with your ears.

330
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,620
算你走運  我沒有一槍...
You're lucky I didn't shoot you in the...

331
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,710
打到牆上
The wall?

332
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,150
打到冰箱上  我太痛苦了
The refrigerator? I'm in so much pain.

333
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,550
我聽說了  親愛的
I heard the news, sweetie.

334
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,680
我很遺憾  真的
I'm very sorry. I am.

335
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,640
我該怎麼做  艾爾
What am I gonna do, Al?

336
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,380
可能要做些很可怕的事
Probably something terrible.

337
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,950
以你的風格
Knowing you.

338
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,510
都是我的錯
It was my fault.

339
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,430
都是我幹的
I fucking did this.

340
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,350
我只想抓住她  看著她
And all I wanna do is grab her and see her

341
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,350
告訴她我很抱歉  而我做不到
and tell her that I'm sorry, and I can't.

342
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,000
她死了
She's gone.

343
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,830
親愛的  你能大聲點嗎
Sweetheart, can you speak up?

344
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,140
你嘴裡含著屌
It's a little hard to hear you

345
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,880
說話聽不到
with that pity dick in your mouth.

346
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,970
聽著  親愛的  你得好好活下去
Now, look, sugar. You need to just keep living.

347
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,320
謝謝你

{\an8}馬修·麥康納創立了一個叫"好好活下去"的慈善基金

350
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,450
聆聽你的痛苦
Listen to the pain.

351
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,280
既能讓你知往事  也能讓你明來者
It's both history teacher and fortune teller.

352
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,940
痛苦教會了我們怎麼做自己  韋德
Pain teaches us who we are, Wade.

353
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,860
有時候因為太痛苦  感覺像是要死去了一般
Sometimes, it's so bad, we feel like we're dying.

354
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,600
但是沒有經歷過死亡怎麼能算活過呢  對吧
But we can't really live till we've died a little, can we?

355
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,340
韋德
Wade?

356
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,950

363
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,460
你是超級英雄嗎
Are you a superhero?

364
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,200
回答非常正確  親愛的
Fucking A, sweetie.

365
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,640
{\an8}不要給北極熊餵食

366
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,810

369
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,230
真不敢相信他還活著
I can't believe he's still alive.

370
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,100
{\an8}疏通劑

371
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,750
真不敢相信你穿著這一身就出門了
I can't believe you left the house in that shirt.

372
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,190
肯定有辦法能死亡
There's gotta be some way to die.

373
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,280

妮莎

386
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,500
妮莎  有點不對勁  我沒法靠近你
Ness, there's something here. I can't get to you.

387
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
你的心沒放對地方
Your heart's not in the right place.

388
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,420
等等  什麼
Wait, hold on. What?

389
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,710
{\an8}我愛你  韋德·威爾遜

我聽說你很擅長開鎖

這裡不需要這項技能

那些孩子為什麼不直接跑路呢
Why don't the kids just run?

403
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,630
誰會選擇留在這種地方
Who would choose to stay in such a place?

404
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,150
你留下  是因為...
You stay because...

405
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,940
內心深處  你知道你不適合離開這裡

脫掉面具  韋德

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,850
我們來玩個遊戲吧
Let's play a game.

414

名字叫"阿德裡安·布勞迪還是亞當·布羅迪"
It's called "Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

415
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,820
來  閉上眼睛  張開嘴巴
Now, close your eyes and open your mouth.

416
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,690
你在這裡不需要耍寶
You don't need to be funny here.

417
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,560
我們必須談談
We must talk.

418
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,080
你需要一個新的開始
You need fresh start.

419
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,690
如此耀眼的陽光
Such a glare.

420
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,000
我彷彿正站在蓋伊提劇院的舞臺上
It's like I'm on stage at the Gaiety.

421
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,660
通過訓練  你可以成為一名X戰警
With training, you can be X-Man.

422
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,790
你在浪費你自己的時間  閃亮耶穌
You're wasting your time, Shiny Jesus.

423
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,140
我不是當X戰警的料
I'm not X-Man material.

424
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,750
你真是本年度低調之最
Understatement of the year.

425
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,230
韋德  這是雪緒
Wade, Yukio.

426
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,620
雪緒  這是韋德
Yukio, Wade.

427
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,750
這他媽是什麼情況
What in the fuck knuckles is this?

428
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,450
她是我的女朋友  你這個混蛋
She's my girlfriend, you intolerant shit.

429
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,320
別這麼沖嘛  福克斯新聞播報員
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes, Fox & Friends.

430
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,240
我只是很驚訝竟然有人願意和你交往
I'm just surprised anyone would date you.

431
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,890
特別是《小馬寶莉》裡的粉紅派
Especially Pinkie Pie from My Little Pony.

432
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,760
我喜歡這傢伙
I like this guy.

433
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,900
再給他個機會
Give him a chance.

434
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,030
看見你這樣真好
It's great seeing you like this.

435
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,030
再見  韋德
Bye, Wade!

436
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,560
在我們這裡有幾條基本規則
Now, some ground rules while under our roof.

437
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,390
"第一條  不準殺人...
"Rule number one. No killing...

438
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,870
"任何人  都不行  不管有多壞"
"Anyone ever, no matter how bad.

439
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,570
"第二條  冰箱裡的所有東西都要加標籤"
"Rule two. Label everything in refrigerator."

440
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,610
韋德
Wade?

441
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,740
韋德
Wade?

442
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,610
-別想追我  -韋德
- Don't try to chase me. - Wade!

443
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,610
{\an8}坐上了X教授的輪椅

444
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,750
我還沒做好再次被摸的準備呢
I'm not ready to be touched again.

445
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,010
牆上掛著好多老頭的照片
All these old guys on the wall.

446
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,140
誰住在這裡  卡莉斯塔·弗洛克哈特嗎
Who lives here, Calista Flockhart?

447
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,140
{\an8}她的丈夫比她大22歲

448
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,360
這些雕像摔下來時已經壞了
Those were already damaged after they fell there!

449
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,280
我到底應該在這裡幹什麼
What am I supposed to do around here, anyway?

450
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,590
坐成一圈  分享我的感受嗎
Sit in a share circle, talk about my feelings?

451
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,500
那我到底該怎麼做
And how would I do that exactly?

452
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,980
因為  其他人都他媽去哪裡了
'Cause where the fuck is everyone?

453
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,250
每次都只有你
It's always just you

454
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,590
還有那個名字奇長無比的負少...
and Negasonic Teenage Longest Name Ever...

455
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,860
夠了
Enough!

456
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,730
我說了不準摸我
I said no touching!

457
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,780
搞什麼
What the fuck?

458
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,000
還以為製片人會給我們點甜頭呢
You'd think the studio would throw us a bone.

459
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,870
稍微有點味道的那種
One that doesn't end up in my mouth.

460
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,090
第一部賺的錢
The first movie made more money

461
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,480
比發明褲子的人賺的都多
than the guy who invented pants.

462
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,700
連一位像樣點的X戰警都請不出來嗎
They can't just dust off one of the famous X-Men?

463
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,830
那個背上長著巨大企鵝翅膀的小子呢
How 'bout that putz with the giant pigeon wings?

464
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,180
那翅膀到底是幹什麼的
What do those do anyway, huh?

465
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,710
能讓他離地個幾厘米
Carry him three feet off the ground

466
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,790
拿到最近的鬆餅屑嗎
to snatch up the nearest muffin crumb?

467
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,010
不不不
No, no, no, no, no. No!

468
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,800
我根本不是當X戰警的料
I am not X-Man material at all.

469
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,500
首先
First off...

470
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,590
我都不是處男  第二...
I'm not even a virgin. Second and more...

471
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,850
我就應該
I should have left you

472
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,640
讓你繼續跟我找到你時一樣自怨自艾
in the self-pitying mess I found you in.

473
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,770
但是這是朋友該做的事  在需要時出現
But this is what friends do. They show up!

474
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,810
並不是錦上添花
Not when convenient or easy.

475
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,170
而是雪中送炭  而你總會讓雪下得更大
When hard, and you always make it hard.

476
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,690
你很不好
You are unwell.

477
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,820
我帶你回來可是冒了很大的險
I'm sticking my neck out bringing you here.

478
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,310
等等  有一個殺害凡妮莎的混蛋跑了
Wait. One of the assholes who killed Vanessa got away.

479
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,050
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ!

480
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,960
我剛剛有一瞬間還以為你要親我呢
I thought you were gonna kiss me for a second there.

481
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,920
如果你真的要親  我也是攔不住你的
Please know I wouldn't be able to stop you if you did.

482
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,010
韋德  不管他們是誰...
Wade, whoever they are...

483
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,410
我們都要抓住他們  帶他們伏法
we track them down and bring them to justice.

484
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,410
是我
It was me.

485
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,890
逃走的那個混蛋是我
I'm the asshole who got away.

486
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,070
我把他們都殺了  除了我
I killed every last one of them, except me.

487
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,810
殺不死我
Couldn't kill me.

488
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
我們本來準備組建一個家庭
We were gonna start a family.

489
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,730
我們...
We were, uh...

490
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,690
我們本來要成為一家人
We were gonna be a family.

491
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,610
韋德
Wade...

492
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,430
凡妮莎已經死了  她不會回來了
Vanessa is gone. She's not coming back.

493
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,350
這裡可能不是你理想中的家庭
This may not be family you want...

494
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,830
但是你需要這個家庭
but it's family you need.

495
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,140
你有一顆善良的心
You have a good heart.

496
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,750
在這裡才能讓它成長
It belongs here where it can grow.

497
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,530
你說什麼
What did you say?

498
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,880
關於我的心
About my heart?

499
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,330
我覺得我來對地方了
I think I'm in the right place.

500
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,960
我來告訴你最大的謊言
I'mma tell you what the big lie is.

501
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,620
廁紙
Toilet paper.

502
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,050
廁紙有什麼問題
What's so bad about toilet paper?

503
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,310
能全擦乾淨
Gets the job done.

504
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,230
真的能全擦乾淨嗎
Does it really get the job done?

505
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,490
好吧  假設你明早醒來
All right. Say you wake up tomorrow morning...

506
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,240
假設  發現你的臉上有一些新鮮的屎
and, hypothetically, find some fresh shit on your face.

507
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,980
你的臉頰上  可能鬍子上也有一些
Your cheek, maybe a little bit in the beard.

508
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,720
搞什麼  說得我都噁心了
What the hell? I'm about to be fucking sick!

509
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,850
你怎麼辦
What do you do?

510
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,200
你會去廁所
Do you go to a bathroom

511
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,940
撕下一些干紙巾
and tear off a piece of dry tissue...

512
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,860
在你的鬍子上擦兩下
and rub it around on your beard a little bit

513
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,470
然後繼續開始這一天的生活嗎
and then go on, get on with your day?

514
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,120
去教堂  也許去參加晚宴  看電影
Go to church, maybe dinner and a movie,

515
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,300
好像無事發生過
like nothing happened?

516
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,730
你到底要說什麼  夥計
Where is this coming from, man?

517
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,990
但其實還是發生了些什麼
But something did happen.

518
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,520
你的臉聞上去一股屎味  對嗎
Your face smells like shit. Right?

519
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,130
所以其實你會做的是
So what you would do,

520
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,430
拿點肥皂  搞點熱水
is you would get some soap, you'd get some hot water...

521
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,830
然後狠狠地擦你的鬍子
and you would scrub the fucking shit

522
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,870
洗上個十來遍
out of your beard for 10 straight minutes.

523
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,610
怎麼擦都覺得不夠
You could not scrub it enough.

524
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,310
你是想噁心我嗎
Are you trying to make me feel disgusting?

525
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,570
我開始覺得...
I'm starting to feel...

526
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,320
廁紙算是很不錯的前菜
Toilet paper is a pretty fine appetizer.

527
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,670
但是然後...
But, then...

528
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,020
哈吉斯自然呵護濕巾
Huggies Natural Care wet wipes.

529
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,450
這才是主菜
That's your main course.

530
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,410
柔軟  濕潤  嬰兒專用
They're soft, they're moist. They're for babies.

531
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,240
最後再用一張紙巾
Finally, one more pass with toilet paper,

532
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,200
擦掉殘餘的水分
maybe clear out that excess moisture.

533
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,900
如果你能找到吹風機的話
Maybe treat yourself to a blow and go,

534
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,250
還能給自己做個頭髮
if you can get you a hair dryer.

535
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,640
只要30秒就行
Just about 30 seconds would do you good.

536
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
搞什麼
The fuck?

537
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,650
年
Year.

538
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,650
什麼
What?

539
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,520
現在是哪一年
What year is it?

540
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,000
這他媽是什麼傻逼問題
What kind of dumbass question is that to ask?

541
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,560
我們接下來要參加為期八周的訓練
We have 8 weeks of boot camp ahead of us, men.

542
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,950
通過訓練  我們能做好應付
That'll get us toned and prepared

543
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,560
各種戰鬥的準備
for all manner of combat.

544
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,870
這絕對不行
Not working out at all.

545
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,570
膠帶
Masking tape.

546
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,960
不是冷卻鋁製品的好朋友
It is no friend to chilled aluminum.

547
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,050
尼龍搭扣  顏色分類  效率高
Velcro. Color-coded, efficient,

548
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,140
有助於保護環境
environmentally friendly.

549
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,490
他在和誰說話
Who is he talking to?

550
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,190
他為什麼穿得像個註冊性侵者
And why is he dressed like a registered sex offender?

551
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,230
你們能集中注意力嗎  女士們
Can we focus for a moment, ladies?

552
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,580
拜託  我們得談談下個月的飲食計劃
Please, we need to talk about next month's meal plan.

553
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,410
顯然大家都很討厭酸橘汁醃魚
Obviously, everyone hated the ceviche.

554
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,800
我看了建議箱
I read the suggestion box.

555
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,460
我還是先打斷你吧
I'm gonna stop you right there.

556
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
你的演技太拙劣了
I see through this weak act.

557
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,900
也許你能裝好人騙過鋼力士
You may have fooled Colossus with this nice guy shit...

558
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,120
但你騙不過我
but not me.

559
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,250
態度好一點
Don't be mean.

560
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,640
別多嘴  NTW
Back off, NTW.

561
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,900
不不不  讓她說
No, no, no. Let her go.

562
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,120
讓她說  沒關係
Let her go, it's okay.

563
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,730
她有權力進行懷疑
She has a right to be skeptical.

564
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,390
看著我  我就是活靶子
Look at me. I'm an easy target.

565
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,960
歷史上來說
You know, historically,

566
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,910
我一直就是惡作劇的代名詞
mischief has been my mistress...

567
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,610
所以我明白  但是我更希望認為...
so I understand, you know. But I like to think...

568
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,530
你們真的感染了我
that you guys have really rubbed off on me.

569
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,580
我希望認為我也感染了你們
I like to think that I've rubbed off around you, too.

570
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,580
很多
A lot.

571
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,280
很久以來的第一次
And for the first time in a long while...

572
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,500
我喜歡我自己
I like me.

573
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,240
-我接受你的道歉  -我沒有道歉
- I accept your apology. - I never apologized.

574
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,850
我在和你的內心對話
I was talking to your heart.

575
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,290
看  你並沒有迷失在你自己過往的想法中
See? You're not lost cause you thought.

576
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,550
我很自豪  我就知道你絕對不會讓我失望
I'm proud. You're everything I knew you can be.

577
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
謝謝你  鋼力士
Thank you, Colossus.

578
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,250
我只是想成為這世界上最好的X戰警[男人]
Just trying to be the world's best X-Man.

579
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,730
抱歉  是X人
Sorry, X-Person.

580
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,000
洗潔精有點不對勁
Hmm. Something wrong with the soap.

581
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,650
沒事
It's fine.

582
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,910
我剛灌滿  多按幾下
I just filled it. Give it a few more pumps there.

583
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,610
現在  不好意思
Now, if you'll excuse me...

584
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,440
現在正是清灰[兔子]季節
it's dust bunny season...

585
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,490
我要去獵兔子了
and I'm hunting wabbits.

586
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,310
再見  韋德
Bye, Wade!

587
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,060
操  操你
Fuck. Fuck you.

588
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,290
沒人生下來就是完美的
No one is born perfect.

589
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,340
但你們可以努力
But you can be.

590
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,730
我知道你們在做生來就會做的事
I know you're doing what comes naturally.

591
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,870
你們控制不了自己
You can't help yourself.

592
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,830
但你可以努力
But you can.

593
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,960
你們需要努力  控制
It takes work, discipline...

594
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,220
和治療
and treatment.

595
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,960
你們的能力
Your abilities...

596
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,710
我知道那有多麼誘人
I know how seductive they are.

597
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,890
讓你感覺自己有多強大
How powerful they make you feel.

598
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,450
但你必須學會如何利用它們
But you must learn never to use them...

599
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,110
這樣它們才不會利用你
so they will never use you.

600
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,940
不要哭
Please don't cry.

601
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,380
我會幫你
I'm going to help.

602
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,600
我會讓你每次想要隨意使用你的能力時
I'm gonna make you feel what you should feel.

603
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,170
都會感受到
How you need to feel...

604
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,560
你應有的感受  你需要的感受
every time you're tempted to act upon your urges.

605
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,520
吸我變種人屌吧  你這個四眼混蛋
Suck my mutant dick, you four-eyed fuck.

606
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,150
韋德
Wade.

607
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,710
韋德
Wade!

608
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,850
請進  我只是在
Come in! Hey, I was just doing

609
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,810
讀一些閑書
a little bit of light reading here...

610
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,290
我們有任務了
We have mission.

611
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,850
那你們要注意安全
Well, you guys be safe out there.

612
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,160
我會為你們祈禱的
I'll be praying for you.

613
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,600
不  我希望你加入我們
No, I want you to join.

614
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,990
不好意思  你說什麼
I'm sorry, what?

615
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,640
你都聽到了
You heard me.

616
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,080
相信我  這是個糟糕的主意
Trust me, that's a terrible idea.

617
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,210
我根本沒準備好
I'm really not ready.

618
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,950
-你準備好了  -我沒有
- You are ready. - I'm not.

619
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,870
五分鐘後上X戰機
Be at the X-Jet in five.

620
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,090
我能做30分鐘
I can do thirty.

621
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,090
-現在就去  -我現在也能做
- Now. - I can do now.

622
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,350
最終出價
Final offer.

623
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,960
艾琳·梅利韋瑟  威特新聞
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.

624
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:58,980
{\an8}變種人事故

625
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,010
正在從變異康復機構
Live here at a breaking news situation

626
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,710
艾瑟斯大宅發回突發新聞現場報道
at the Essex House for Mutant Rehabilitation.

627
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,710
一名變異人男孩
A mutant boy is appearing to have

628
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,230
引發了一起事故
some sort of an incident...

629
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,750
-警察正在我身後  -離我遠一點
- with police here behind me. - Get away from me!

630
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,230
兩輛警察被其掀翻
There are two police vehicles that are overturned.

631
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,710
-到處都起火了  -滾開  後退
- There are open fires. - Fuck off! Stay back!

632
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
現場一片混亂
A scene of absolute chaos here.

633
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,980
冷靜點
Calm down.

634
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,630
我要燒死你們  給我後退
I'll burn you! You stay back!

635
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,160
給我後退
Get away from me!

636
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,680
你們想死嗎
You wanna fucking die?

637
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,920
X戰警到達了現場...
And it appears as if the X-Men are arriving...

638
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
散開
Scatter!

639
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,530
好像還帶了一名實習生
...with what appears to be a trainee.

640
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,580
所有人冷靜點  專家來了  我...
Everyone, calm down! The pros are here. I...

641
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,790
我們是X戰警
We're the X-Men!

642
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,360
60年代種族歧視的過時隱喻
A dated metaphor for racism in the '60s.

643
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,360
{\an8}X戰警的創作初衷確實和倡導種族平權有關

644
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,930
所以  敬你
So, respect.

645
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,230
稍息  警官
At ease, Officer.

646
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,330
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

647
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,110
我的職責
My job!

648
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,550
是你說我準備好了
You're the one who said I was ready,

649
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,110
我明明對你進行了反駁
and I frankly disagreed with you.

650
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,550
但我們還是來了  力圖摒棄我們的嫌隙
But here we are, trying to overcome our differences.

651
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,030
就像碧昂絲說過  "拜託...
Like Beyonce says, "Please...

652
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,250
"拜託  不要再騙我了"
"Please, stop cheating on me."

653
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,820
這已經是第五起事故了
This is the fifth incident.

654
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,080
這孩子必須得進冰盒  不能待在這裡
This kid needs to be in the Ice Box, not here.

655
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,780
羅素歸我們照看
Russell belongs in our care.

656
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,610
不能進監獄  我保證...
Not in prison. I assure you...

657
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,780
一切都在我們掌控之中
we have everything under control.

658
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,910
後退  我要燒死你們
Stay back! I'll burn you!

659
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,170
我好像看不出
Not getting a real

660
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,310
是在"掌控之中"啊  馬蒂
"Under control" vibe here, Marty.

661
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,400
-你是叫格倫吧  -丹尼爾
- It is Glen, isn't it? - Daniel.

662
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,660
回答我的問題就行  米格爾
I'll ask the questions, Miguel.

663
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,050
讓我和這孩子談談
Let me talk to the kid.

664
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,930
你和你這雙奇怪的性感秘密雙唇待在這裡
You stay here with your weird, secret sex lips.

665
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,710
你想死嗎
You wanna die?

666
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,930
這孩子這麼可愛
This kid's adorable.

667
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,970
真不知道我為什麼還帶了空包彈
I don't know why I packed the hollow points.

668
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,190
我要燒掉你們的蛋蛋
I'll burn your balls off!

669
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,590
第一天  我好緊張
First day. I'm so nervous!

670
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,200
你剛剛說"空包彈"嗎
Did you just say "Hollow points"?

671
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,680
沒錯  也許應該帶一把超級水槍
Yeah, probably should've brought a Super Soaker.

672
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,250
你好
Hi, there!

673
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,030
後退  不然我就弄死那個賈斯汀·比伯
Stay back or Justin Bieber dies!

674
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,560
賈斯汀·比伯  他叫你賈斯汀·比伯
Justin Bieber. He called you Justin Bieber.

675
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,600
等等  等等  等等
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

676
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,780
我們還是先別來這一套不知道什麼玩意
Okay, let's not do whatever that is.

677
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,350
行嗎  我們先談談
Okay? Let's just talk!

678
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,000
你叫羅斯  對吧
It's Russell, right?

679
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,310
-火拳  -火拳
- Firefist. - Firefist.

680
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,570
這名號不錯  燒到哪裡
Ooh, that's a great name. Where does it burn?

681
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,050
就燒拳頭  還是燒到手肘
Just the fist, or all the way up to the elbow?

682
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,760
絕對是燒到手肘
Definitely all the way up to the elbow.

683
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,630
乖乖跟我們走  不然會惹上麻煩
Come quietly, or there will be trouble.

684
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,460
-這句話是《機械戰警》的  -是《機械戰警》的
- You stole that from Robocop! - That's from Robocop!

685
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,150
後退
Just stand down!

686
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,290
你真讓我丟臉  聽著  火...
You're embarrassing me. Look, Fire...

687
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,160
天啊  我說不出口  我真的很抱歉
Oh, my God! I can't say it! I'm so sorry!

688
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,690
該死  還真有本事
Oh, shit! That fucking does it!

689
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,130
把手放在你的膝蓋後
Put your hands behind your knees

690
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,650
把頭蹲下來  馬上
and get down on your head! Now!

691
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,960
韋德  第一條規則是什麼
Wade! What was first rule?

692
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,960
給冰箱裡的所有東西貼上標籤
Label everything in the refrigerator!

693
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,610
-不要擅自升序  -規則就是用來破壞的
- Do not escalate! - Rules are meant to be broken!

694
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,090
那跟設定規則的本意
That's the exact opposite

695
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,490
恰好背道而馳
of what they're meant for!

696
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,490
操  好吧
Fuck! Fine!

697
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,140
那我從頭開始
I'll start from the beginning.

698
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,540
我叫死侍  我是一名X戰警
My name is Deadpool, and I'm an X-Man.

699
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,540
-實習生  -閉嘴
- Trainee! - Shut it!

700
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,760
聽著  我明白
Look, I get it.

701
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,540
你很害怕
All right, you're scared.

702
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,200
一個人
Alone.

703
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,330
你沒有家庭
You got no family.

704
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,420
我也沒有家庭
I didn't have a family, either.

705
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,200
你住在這個垃圾堆  你猜怎麼著
You live in this dump. Guess what?

706
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,940
我以前也住在這種狗洞
I used to live in a shithole just like it.

707
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,210
但是你知道嗎
But you know something?

708
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,990
一個智慧的女人曾跟我說過
A wise woman once said to me...

709
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,510
"大聲點"
"Speak up."

710
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,390
"你嘴裡含著屌  說話聽不到"
"I can't hear you with that pity dick in your mouth."

711
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,040
太過了嗎  我扯太遠了
Too much? I went too far.

712
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,540
{\an8}瑞安·雷諾茲[簽名]
[金剛狼燕麥片]

713
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,530
真興奮
That was effervescent.

714
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,830
好好讀書  孩子
Stay in school, kid.

715
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,710
不讀也行  我就沒讀
Or don't. I didn't.

716
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,360
而我現在是一名X戰警
And I'm an X-Man.

717
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,530
實習生
Trainee.

718
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,930
操
Fuck it!

719
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,710
超級英雄式落地
Superhero landing coming up!

720
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:48,570
{\an8}第一部中吐槽"那樣真的對膝蓋很不好"

721
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,980
操操操
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

722
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,110
這種落地法真是太不現實了
That is so not practical.

723
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,740
我也許能適應這種X戰警的方式
I could get used to this X-Man shit.

724
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,920
實習生
Trainee!

725
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,180
實習生
Trainee!

726
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,010
給他上能力束縛帶  快
Get a power restraint on him. Now!

727
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,270
冷靜點  小松鼠  結束了  抓到你了
Calm down, squirt. It's over. We got ya.

728
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,670
那是用來幹什麼的
What's that do?

729
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,230
能力衰減項圈
Power-dampening collar.

730
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,580
抑制所有變種人能力
Shuts down all mutant abilities.

731
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,450
摘不下來  除非用手榴彈
You can't get it off. Unless you've got a grenade.

732
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
本來一開始就可以用這個
Huh. Could've used one of those in the first act.

733
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,760
謝謝你
Thank you!

734
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,850
真是太令人激動了
That was absolutely thrilling.

735
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,120
真正的英雄主義
True heroism in action.

736
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,810
我們欠你的
We are in your debt.

737
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,290
接下來就交給我們吧
We can take it from here.

738
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,560
帶我去冰盒吧  求你了
Take me to the Ice Box, please!

739
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,780
任何地方都比這裡好
Anywhere's better than here.

740
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,080
相信我  孩子
Believe me, son,

741
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,870
你絕對不想去冰盒的
you do not wanna go to the Ice Box.

742
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,520
希特勒的肛門在那裡會擁擠得像懷基基海灘
That place makes Hitler's anus look like Waikiki.

743
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,440
先帶你進去吧  年輕人
Let's get you inside, young man.

744
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
不  等一下  等一下
No, wait, wait. Wait.

745
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,010
你們待著別動
You guys stay there.

746
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,710
那些人傷害你了嗎
Those guys hurt you?

747
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,190
誰
Who?

748
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,940
那個禿頭  還是賈羅德·庫辛那[特朗普女婿]
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

749
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,900
兩個都是
Both of 'em?

750
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,340
去他媽的
Oh, fuck it.

751
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,950
四五個瞬間
Four or five moments!

752
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,040
什麼
I'm sorry?

753
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,260
四五個瞬間
Four or five moments!

754
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,260
做英雄只需要這點時間
That's all it takes to be a hero.

755
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,610
人們以為你醒來就是英雄樣
People think you wake up a hero...

756
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,790
刷牙就是英雄樣
brush your teeth a hero...

757
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,750
手淫到洗潔精盒裡就是英雄樣
ejaculate into a soap dispenser a hero.

758
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,880
但是不  做英雄只要幾分鐘
But, no, being a hero takes only a few moments!

759
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,890
幾分鐘
A few moments...

760
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,630
做別人不願意做的臟活
doing the ugly stuff no one else will do.

761
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,240
不
No!

762
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,160
後退  不要開火
Stand down! Hold your fire!

763
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,550
-韋德  你做了什麼  -鋼力士  不要
- Wade, what did you do? - Colossus, no!

764
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,860
你說得對  韋德  你不是當X戰警的料
You were right, Wade. You are not X-Men material.

765
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,210
不是吧  閃亮甘地
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

766
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,730
你怎麼看出來的
What was your first clue?

767
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,910
透過那混蛋臉上的穿過去的彈孔嗎
The hollow point through that fuckhead's face?

768
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,260
那孩子遭到虐待了
That kid was abused!

769
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,350
-你看得出來  永遠看得出來  -我們有規矩
- You can tell, you can  always tell! - We have rules!

770
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,130
你不是法官  陪審團或行刑者
You are not judge, jury or executioner!

771
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,140
去你的規則  我為正確的事而戰
Fuck your rules! I fight for what's right!

772
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,010
有時候就得用臟的
And sometimes you gotta fight dirty!

773
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,100
你最後一次讓我失望了  韋德
You let me down for the last time, Wade.

774
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,540
把這些人關起來
Okay, get these guys in the pod.

775
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,760
帶他們去冰盒
Take them to the Ice Box.

776
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,390
寶貝
Hey, baby!

777
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,740
不知道我會加入什麼幫派
I wonder what gang I'll be in.

778
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,180
有沒有分院帽之類的東西
Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?

779
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,830
我一直覺得我自己
I've always seen myself as

780
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,270
更適合進東海岸赫奇帕奇血源
more of an East Coast Hufflepuff.

781
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,750
我在愛彼迎預定上犯了一個巨大的錯誤
I've made a critical error on my Airbnb reservation.

782
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,670
網站上看起來明明不是這樣的
This is not what the website looked like at all.

783
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,980
不過我很喜歡這裝修風格
I love the decor though.

784
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,980
我真沒想到絕望真的是一種顏色
I had no idea hopeless was a color.

785
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,280
左轉  蠢蛋
Hard left, douchebag.

786
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,030
你先進
Please, after you.

787
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,860
又是個街頭煩人的小子
Another disgusting minority off the streets.

788
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,030
今晚能睡個好覺了
We'll sleep well tonight.

789
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,120
我們去吃個甜甜圈吧
Let's get a bagel.

790
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,220
晚安  煩人的傢伙
Nighty-night, you annoying prick!

791
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,860
你完全沒了你的超能力
You're a long way from your superpowers.

792
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,340
就是個小癌癥
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

793
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,870
別擔心  早就患上了
Not to worry, we're old friends.

794
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,130
操
Fuck!

795
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,350
我曾經很想做超級英雄
I wanted to be a superhero.

796
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,350
一直想要一套真正的超級英雄戰服
Always wanted a real super suit.

797
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,960
然後發生了什麼
What happened?

798
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,050
你什麼時候見過超胖的超級英雄
When was the last time you saw a plus-sized superhero?

799
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,270
從來沒見過
Never.

800
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,100
行業歧視
The industry discriminates.

801
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,270
去他們媽的超級英雄
Fuck superheroes.

802
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,580
最讓我生氣的是
The thing that pisses me off the most...

803
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,450
我從來沒有為自己站出來過
I never stood up for myself in there.

804
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,980
我這一輩子
My whole life.

805
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,500
我一直在等待別人來拯救我
I've been waiting for someone to come and save me.

806
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,860
沒有人為了我做出什麼犧牲
Nobody's gonna sacrifice anything for me.

807
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,260
我得開始自己照顧自己
I gotta start taking care of myself.

808
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,350
我現在有任務了
I have a mission now.

809
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,040
等我出去  要做的第一件事就是...
The first thing I wanna do when I get out of here...

810
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,440
活活燒死那個校長
burn the headmaster alive...

811
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,180
然後跟他的屍體殘害拍一張自拍
and then take a selfie with his smoldering corpse.

812
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,660
這是我在《聖經》中最喜歡的部分
Aw. That's, like, my favorite part of the Bible.

813
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,880
我身上沒有襪子玩偶
I don't have a sock puppet on me...

814
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,970
但是他對你組哦了什麼
but what did he do to you?

815
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,630
他嘗了嘗彩虹嗎[雞姦]
Did he taste the rainbow?

816
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,720
我應該小聲說的  但那樣彩虹糖就會告我們
I'd whisper it, but Skittles would sue us.

817
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,890
那混蛋恨變種人
Fucker hates mutants.

818
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,890
他想通過折磨我們  毀滅我們的基因
He tried to beat the genes out of us.

819
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,460
沒有比相信"祈禱能消滅同性戀"更可怕的人了
Nothing worse than a "Pray the gay away" Type guy.

820
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,640
該死的混蛋
Sick piece of shit.

821
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,730
明天  我們要找到這裡塊頭最大的傢伙
Tomorrow, we'll find the biggest guy in here...

822
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,390
然後讓他變成我們的人
and we'll make him our bitch!

823
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,370
{\an8}最高安全級別區域

824
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,650
怎麼回事
What was that?

825
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,260
那就是這裡塊頭最大的傢伙
That is the biggest guy in here.

826
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,400
冰盒有個傳說
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

827
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,270
儘管從來沒有人親眼目睹過
though no one's ever seen it,

828
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,530
他們在地下室關了一個大怪獸
they keep a monster in the basement.

829
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,880
埋下了一個巨大又呼之欲出的伏筆
Right next to a huge, steaming bowl of foreshadowing.

830
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,530
聽著
Look.

831
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,800
我沒法保護你
I can't protect you.

832
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,970
只要戴著這個項圈
With this collar on,

833
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,150
我的超能力就只有脫韁的癌癥
my superpower is just unbridled cancer.

834
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,680
給我一把弓和箭  我就基本是鷹眼了
Give me a bow and arrow, I'm basically Hawkeye.

835
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,810
不好意思
Now, if you'll excuse me...

836
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,030
我還要慢慢長腫瘤  凡妮莎還在等我
I've got tumors to grow. Vanessa awaits.

837
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,550
我要給我們做個稱手的傢伙
I'll start by making us a shank.

838
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,510
-行吧  -我偷了警衛的筆
- Good listening. - I stole that guard's pen...

839
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,510
藏在了監獄傳統儲物處
and stashed it in the old prison wallet,

840
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,950
如果你聽得懂的話
if you know what I'm saying.

841
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,470
我真希望我聽不懂你說的話
I really hope I don't know what you're saying.

842
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,910
我知道就在裡面  就是得拿出來
I know it's in there, I just need to get it out.

843
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,050
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ.

844
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,740
我可以聽到你在裡面翻找的聲音
I can hear you rummaging around in there.

845
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,180
他們會提供洗耳朵的洗液嗎
Do they make Purell for your ears?

846
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,490
現在為你播報之前那則新聞的後續
And to update you on the story reported earlier,

847
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,230
在變種人康復機構
after a lengthy standoff

848
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,890
艾瑟斯之家外進行長時間的僵持之後
outside the Essex House for Mutant Rehabilitation...

849
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,240
兩名變種人被捕
two mutants were arrested

850
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,020
並被送往冰盒
and transported to the Ice Box...

851
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,460
進入修復模式
Entering repair mode.

852
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,470
多輛警車被毀
...several police cars were destroyed

853
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,340
X戰警也到場恢復秩序
and the X-Men were called in to restore order.

854
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,580
七號監獄和九號監獄
Cells seven and nine

855
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,020
現向醫療人員開放
now off-limits for medical personnel.

856
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,540
七號監獄和九號監獄
Cells seven and nine

857
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,320
現向醫療人員開放
now off-limits for medical personnel.

858
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,110
別那麼做
Don't do that.

859
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,030
什麼  你為什麼要這麼做
What? Why are you winking at me?

860
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,040
我罩著你
I got your back.

861
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,300
天啊
Oh, my God.

862
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,860
你病了  我要保護你
You're sick, I gotta protect you.

863
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,820
別來煩我  孩子
Just leave me alone, kid.

864
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,000
太好了
Oh, great.

865
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,390
你們好  新來的
Well, hello there, new fish.

866
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,480
見到幾張新面孔可真不錯
It's nice to see some fresh faces around here.

867
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,790
我拍過幾張封面照
I've done some light catalog work...

868
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,320
但是做模特其實只是進軍演藝界的跳板
but, really, modeling is just a stepping stone to acting.

869
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,730
我是在和他說話
I was talking to him.

870
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,580
我們見過嗎  我記不得你的小鬍子了
Have we met? I can't place your mustache.

871
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,860
布萊克[黑]·湯姆·卡西迪
Black Tom Cassidy.

872
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,280
懷特[白]·韋德·威爾遜
White Wade Wilson.

873
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,760
你的超能力是什麼  文化輸出嗎
What's your superpower? Cultural appropriation?

874
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,370
這裡都傳你是個最難搞定的傢伙
You're supposed to be the toughest cunt in here.

875
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,990
我倒是覺得看起來不像啊
You don't look like much to me.

876
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,470
號子的首要準則  混蛋
First rule of the yard, fuckface...

877
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,560
找到塊頭最大的傢伙  把他變成...
find the biggest guy and make him your...

878
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,600
蒂爾達
Second biggest guy.

879
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,090
我現在可不想染上肝炎
The last thing I need is more hepatitis.

880
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,700
還很滑  這桌子要擦一下
Oh, it's slippery, too. This table needs a wipe down!

881
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,570
能不能把這桌子擦一下
Can we get a wipe down on the table?

882
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:59,090
孩子  我覺得你站錯邊了
Kid, I think you picked the wrong side.

883
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,490
不  我沒有  她是我的朋友
No, I didn't! He's my friend!

884
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,790
閉嘴  我們不是朋友
Zip it. We're not friends.

885
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:06,580
你要被我暴揍了
You're about to get dick-slapped.

886
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,900
我真是太爽了  你就...
I had so much fun! You were like...

887
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,030
我就說"坐下  混蛋"
And I was like, "Take a seat, shit dick."

888
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,820
讓我安詳地去吧
Just let me die in peace.

889
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,990
我們是完美的團隊
We make a great team!

890
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,600
天啊  我們不是團隊
Oh, God! We're not a team.

891
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,000
你之前為什麼那麼說  我們是朋友  搭檔
Why'd you say that back there? We're friends, partners.

892
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,440
我們不是搭檔  或朋友
We're not partners or friends.

893
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,960
結局不會是我們奔向落日
This doesn't end with us riding into the sunset.

894
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,180
而是我死於癌癥
It ends with me dying of cancer...

895
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,100
你贏下了冰盒最柔軟嘴巴獎
and you winning the Ice Box award for softest mouth.

896
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,140
全世界  我只在乎
There's only one person in this world

897
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,970
一個人  而她死了
that I care about, and she's gone.

898
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,930
你想活下來嗎
You wanna survive?

899
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,290
別再想著搞定塊頭最大的傢伙了...
Stop trying to shank the biggest guys in here...

900
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,200
跟他們做朋友
and make friends with them.

901
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,120
找個人做朋友
Make friends with someone.

902
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,940
除我之外的任何人
Anyone but me.

903
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,430
布萊克·蒂姆也行
Maybe even Black Tim.

904
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,950
布萊克·伊萬  我也不知道
Black Evan, I don't know.

905
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,480
我只記得他是非裔的
All I remember is he was African-American.

906
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,040
系統故障
System malfunctioning.

907
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:06,440
7號  12號  14號  27號監獄
Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.

908
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,750
回到牢房裡  你們這些骯臟的變種人  回去
Back in your cells, you filthy mutants! Get in there!

909
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:12,100
1號  3號  7號  8號監獄
Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.

910
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,660
搜索中
Searching.

911
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,840
{\an8}已找到
韋德·威爾遜
羅素·柯林斯

912
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,580
定位4號監獄
Cell 04 located.

913
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,110
門打不開
Door won't open!

914
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,760
給我跪下
On your fucking knees!

915
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,410
那是我們的監獄
That was our cell.

916
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,850
我怎麼惹了一個
What did I do to piss off a grumpy old fucker

917
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,070
冬兵胳膊的傢伙
with a Winter Soldier arm?

918
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,250
離我遠一點  孩子
Get away from me, kid!

919
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,090
聽我說  快跑
Listen to me! Go!

920
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,880
你好  羅素
Hello, Russell.

921
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,460
你是誰
Who are you?

922
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,590
我是蝙蝠俠
I'm Batman.

923
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,700
真是電力十足
Oh. That's got some zip.

924
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,010
別難過  我自己都弄不死我自己
Don't feel bad. Even I can't kill me.

925
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,280
快說
Talk!

926
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,500
什麼樣的孬種會想殺死一個14歲的孩子
What kind of spineless shit stick tries to kill a 14-year-old boy?

927
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,330
你最好還是趕緊開口
You might wanna start talking!

928
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,460
因為我以前可是經常在這種時候開槍的
'Cause I got a long history of firing at times like this!

929
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,980
我叫電索
The name's Cable.

930
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,680
我來自未來  別插手
I'm from the future. Just walk away.

931
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,690
你來自未來
So, you're from the future.

932
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,690
那我有三個問題
I have three questions then.

933
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:19,340
一  迴響貝斯還流行嗎
One, is dubstep still a thing?

934
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,870
二  那時候還有家釀酒嗎
Two, do people still homebrew?

935
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,480
三  都朋德找到真愛了嗎
And three, does Dopinder ever find love?

936
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,440
小娘們才玩迴響貝斯
Dubstep's for pussies.

937
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,790
你好黑暗
You're so dark!

938
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,920
你確定你不是從DC宇宙過來的嗎
Are you sure you're not from the DC universe?

939
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,230
我愛迴響貝斯
I love dubstep!

940
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,950
那是個腰包嗎
Is that a fanny pack?

941
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,560
我1990年後就沒見過這玩意了
I used to have one of those in 1990-never.

942
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,650
這可以用來紀念你
Something to remember you by.

943
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,480
還給我  我去哪兒都會帶著這枚硬幣
Give me that back! That goes with me everywhere.

944
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,880
就像你關於腰包的記憶一樣
Like the memory of your fucking fanny pack!

945
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,710
你為什麼要保護那孩子
Why are you protecting the kid?

946
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,330
我才不在乎他
I don't give a fuck about him...

947
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,760
以及他的《你是我的媽媽嗎》[兒童繪本]系列
and his Are You My Mother? complex!

948
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,370
這是用來幹什麼的
What's this one do?

949
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,170
所有電影中  英雄都會
In every film, there's a moment

950
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,610
觸到他的低谷
when the hero hits rock bottom.

951
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,610
在《冰上輕馳》中  是在約翰·坎迪
In Cool Runnings, it was when John Candy's

952
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,610
珍貴的滑雪桿斷裂時
prized bobsled broke.

953
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,400
在《人體蜈蚣》中  是在那些人簽約
In Human Centipede, it was when those people...

954
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,010
同意出演那部電影時
signed on to be in that movie.

955
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,190
不過在這部電影裡
But in this film, well...

956
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,450
這一幕正在你的眼前
you're looking at it.

957
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,230
跪下  變種人
On your fucking knees, mutant.

958
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,150
谷...
Rock...

959
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,680
底
meet bottom.

960
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,510
我愛你  韋德·威爾遜
I love you, Wade Wilson.

961
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,730
妮莎
Ness?

962
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,260
妮莎
Hey, Ness!

963
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,960
妮莎  你能讓我進去嗎
Ness, can you let me in?

964
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,090
求你了  求你了
Please! Please.

965
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,400
上帝啊
Jesus.

966
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,050
你給我的提示太少了
You're not giving me a lot of direction here.

967
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,920
我已經到末路了
I'm at the end of my rope.

968
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,760
後來我加入了X戰警
Then I joined the X-Men.

969
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,630
我進了監獄  我...
I went to prison. I, uh...

970
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,240
是那個孩子嗎
Is it the kid?

971
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,200
孩子們給我們一個機會變得更好
Kids give us a chance to be better than we used to be.

972
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
那個孩子
The kid!

973
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,870
那就是她的意思
That's exactly what she meant.

974
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,310
你的心沒放對地方
Your heart needs to be in the right place.

975
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,220
我不會拋棄這個孩子
I'm not gonna abandon this kid.

976
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,880
他身邊  從來沒有任何人
He's never had anyone, ever.

977
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,270
我要變得無私
I need to be selfless.

978
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,270
好吧  但那是什麼意思
Yeah, but what does that mean?

979
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,580
意思是我要拯救羅素
It means I'm gonna save Russell.

980
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,150
也許我救不了凡妮莎
Maybe I couldn't save Vanessa...

981
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:21,190
但也許我能拯救新西蘭的青壯少年
but maybe I can save a robust teenager from New Zealand.

982
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,280
但是我的意思是"無私"這個詞
Yeah, but what I mean is, like, the word "Selfless."

983
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,850
我真的不懂那是什麼意思
I literally don't know what that means.

984
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,070
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

985
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,850
聽著  據我的人說...
Okay, look. According to my guy, okay...

986
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,730
這些變種人馬上要被轉移到
those muties are being transferred

987
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,600
80英里外的超級監獄了
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

988
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,470
很好  我在路上劫他們
Great, I'll pick 'em off along the way.

989
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,690
先別急著出蛋  夥計
Hold your testicles there, buddy, okay?

990
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,730
這可是會有重裝部隊進行護送...
We're talking about an armored convoy...

991
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,390
還有一名來自未來的超級兇殘士兵
and a vicious super soldier from the future...

992
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,780
想把你的頭骨變成一個飛機杯
that is looking to turn your skull into a fuckable ashtray.

993
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,310
你知道我們要幹什麼嗎
You know what we need to do?

994
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,220
我們要組建一支小隊
We need to build a fucking team.

995
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,350
我們需要他們堅韌  不鉆牛角尖
We need 'em tough, morally flexible...

996
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,010
並且要年輕  能守住這個隊標10到12年
and young enough so they can carry this franchise 10 to 12 years.

997
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,920
一隊專業的混蛋
A team of highly-skilled motherfuckers.

998
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,010
我說的可是《十四羅漢》  《俠盜二號》
I'm talking about some Ocean's 14 shit. Rogue Two.

999
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,010
{\an8}這兩部分別為《十一羅漢》  《俠盜一號》

1000
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,490
《約翰·威克3》  但是原班製作人水平
John Wick 3,but with the original director.

1001
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,450
我的身體就是死亡的工具
My body is an instrument of death.

1002
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,840
現在不是時候  都朋德
Not now, Dopinder.

1003
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,370
我可能可以派上大用場
I could be of great use.

1004
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,980
你的超能力是什麼
What's your superpower?

1005
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:09,460
-勇氣  -真可愛
- Courage. - That's adorable.

1006
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,160
那你有勇氣去查看
Do you have the courage to check and see...

1007
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,590
分配器中有足夠的衛生棉嗎
if there are enough sanitary napkins in the dispenser?

1008
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,680
是  長官
Yes, sir.

1009
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,990
抱歉讓你看到這一幕
I'm sorry you had to see that,

1010
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,380
不過很高興讓你聽到了他的回答
although I'm glad you heard it.

1011
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,340
好了  我去招募收簡歷
All right, I'll put out a call for resumes.

1012
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,650
但是我們不支付醫保和牙醫費用
But we're not paying medical or dental.

1013
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,740
該重新啟用求職網了
It's time to get back on LinkedIn.

1014
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,250
所有犯人請注意
Attention, all inmates!

1015
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,730
將於八點開始向交叉力最高等級監獄
Transport to Cross Force Maximum Security

1016
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,260
變種人關押所
Mutant Containment Facility...

1017
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,260
進行犯人轉移
will begin at 0800 hours.

1018
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,300
將於六點開始檢查監獄
Inspection of your cells and out processing

1019
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,390
以及事務處理
will begin at 0600.

1020
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,190
你想要什麼
What the fuck do you want?

1021
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,060
那他媽是我的布丁
That's my fucking pudding.

1022
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,100
-去你媽的布丁  -你喜歡布丁
- Fuck your pudding! - You like pudding?

1023
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,130
有人嗎
Hello?

1024
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,780
我知道你在裡面
I know you're in there.

1025
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,760
作為這裡塊頭最大的傢伙肯定也不好過吧
Must be hard being the biggest guy in here.

1026
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,330
高處不勝寒吧
Lonely at the top, eh?

1027
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,330
他們明天就要轉移我們了
They're moving us tomorrow.

1028
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,590
也許我能帶你離開這裡
Maybe I can get you out of here.

1029
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:26,950
然後整個世界都是我們的
And we can make the whole world our bitch.

1030
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,560
我們需要一個密碼
We need a secret code.

1031
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,220
不  那太蠢了  羅素  笨蛋
No, that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

1032
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,010
我們是一個團隊
We're a team.

1033
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,010
我們像暴徒  我們像黑幫
We're like thugs, we're like gangsters.

1034
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,710
我就像圖帕克  你就像冰塊
I'm like Tupac, and you're like Ice Cube.

1035
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,840
假設她也會唱饒舌
Supposedly, she can rap, too.

1036
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,060
我喜歡
I like that.

1037
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,760
很棒  這些都很棒
Terrific, these are all terrific.

1038
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,540
這是喧囂
Meet Bedlam.

1039
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,850
名字不錯  超能力
Cool name! Superpowers?

1040
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,410
我可以干擾電磁場
I can distort electrical fields.

1041
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:04,850
包括你腦內的場
Including the one inside your brain...

1042
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,590
造成焦慮  混亂...
causing anxiety, confusion...

1043
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,640
痛苦
pain.

1044
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,770
基本上來說  你就是戴夫·馬休斯
So, basically, you're Dave Matthews.

1045
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,950
我們可以用上他
We can use him.

1046
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,390
我是澤特蓋斯特
I'm Zeitgeist.

1047
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:17,730
不錯  我喜歡
Cool. I like it.

1048
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,040
那你有能力
So you have the power

1049
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,430
抓住社會的命脈嗎
to put your finger on the pulse of society?

1050
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,650
不
No.

1051
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,260
不  我會吐酸液
No, I spit acidic vomit.

1052
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,880
-要我表演一下嗎  -不
- Do you want me to demonstrate? - No!

1053
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,400
我們信你
We'll take your word for it.

1054
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,790
謝謝  聽著  我們都在阿比漢堡吃過飯
Thank you. Yeah. Listen, we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

1055
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,230
這是消隱者
And this is the Vanisher.

1056
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,580
但是...
But...

1057
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,240
消隱者
Vanisher!

1058
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,410
-真棒  -對吧
- Nice! - Right?

1059
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,850
他根本不在  對嗎
He's not here, is he?

1060
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,420
他可能吃到了
He may be running late.

1061
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,860
我叫拉什蒂  但我用碎星這個名字
My name's Rusty, but I go by Shatterstar.

1062
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,120
很不錯

1065
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,260
-那你是外星人了  -名字真爛
- So you're an alien, I guess. - Bad name.

1066
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,000
那對我們有什麼幫助呢
How does that, uh, help us?

1067
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,960
我基本上什麼都比你們槍
I'm basically better than you at everything.

1068
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,700
總有一天  我要找個所有人
Just once, I'm gonna find a planet of people

1069
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,310
各方面都不如我的星球
that are worse than me at everything.

1070
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,570
都是一群蠢蛋
A whole bunch of functional idiots.

1071
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,530
我要去那裡  變成他們的超人
I'm gonna go there, and I'm gonna be their Superman.

1072
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,710
你是說加拿大嗎
Isn't that Canada?

1073
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,710
{\an8}雷諾茲是加拿大人

1074
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,140
你他媽給我閉嘴
You shut your goddamn trash mouth!

1075
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,840
-這是  -多米洛

- What's your shtick? - I'm lucky.

1077
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,370
那不是超能力
That's not a superpower.

1078
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:25,540
-就是  -不是
- Yeah, it is. - No, it isn't.

1079
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,850
-就是  -不是
- Yeah, it is. - No, it isn't.

1080
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:27,940
-就是  -不是
- Yeah, it is. - No, it isn't.

1081
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,020
-就是  -不是
- Yes, it is. - No, it isn't.

1082
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,070
真的不是
Yeah, it is.Really isn't.

1083
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,330
-不是  -就是
- No, it isn't. - Yes, it is.

1084
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,550
我說吧
Told you.

1085
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:33,940
滾出我的腦子
Get out of my head!

1086
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,600
我沒在你腦子裡
I'm not in your head.

1087
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,990
我在一個11歲小孩的臥室裡
I'm in an 11-year-old's bedroom.

1088
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,160
如果你真有那麼幸運
Well, if you're so lucky,

1089
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,820
那你為什麼來這裡和我們一起
then what are you doing here with us?

1090
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:40,990
我還不知道
I don't know yet.

1091
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,560
什麼意思
What's that supposed to mean?

1092
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,860
我來這裡是有原因的  我知道的時候自然會知道
There's a reason why I'm here, and I'll know when I know.

1093
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:45,690
通常我的一切都會順其自然發生
Everything usually just kind of works out for me.

1094
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,560
比如2008年的瑞安·雷諾茲
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

1095
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,000
我不知道那是誰
I don't know who that is.

1096
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,520
你應聘成功了
You're hired.

1097
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:52,610
我真走運
Lucky me.

1098
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,870
我喜歡她
I like her!

1099
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,310
最後一個
And last, but not least...

1100
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,490
皮特
Peter.

1101
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,400
你在逗我嗎還是...
Am I getting catfished here or...?

1102
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,360
你有什麼能力嗎
Any powers you wanna tell us about?

1103
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,020
沒有
No.

1104
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,760
我沒有能力
I don't have one.

1105
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,110
我只是看到了廣告
Um, I just saw the ad.

1106
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,930
沒有任何超能力嗎
No superpowers at all?

1107
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,070
我有1型和2型糖尿病
Uh, I have both Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

1108
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,110
糖尿病就這兩種
That's all the diabetes.

1109
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,460
是啊  你都佔了
Right? Yeah, you got 'em all.

1110
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,420
如果你發現3型  記得告訴我們
If you find a Type 3, let us know.

1111
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,990
對
Yeah.

1112
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,120
你應聘成功了
You're in.

1113
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,690
-對  -操
- Yeah. - Fuck!

1114
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,470
很讓人有成就感
It's fulfilling work.

1115
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:33,870
快走
Let's go!

1116
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:50,100
17車隊正離開冰盒
This is Convoy 17 departing the Ice Box.

1117
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,500
正在路上
We are en route.

1118
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,460
和平時期讓人軟弱
Peacetime makes people soft.

1119
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,860
我生於戰爭
I was born into war.

1120
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,560
長於戰爭
Bred into it.

1121
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,470
知道了
Okay.

1122
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,870
你感受過的最痛苦的事是什麼
What's the most pain you've ever felt?

1123
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,090
這些束帶挺...
These restraints are pretty...

1124
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,000
大家以為理解痛苦
People think they understand pain.

1125
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,480
其實他們對痛苦根本沒有概念
They have no concept of it

1126
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,480
他們只知道自己最糟糕的經歷
beyond their own worst experience.

1127
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:26,270
對五歲的人來說
5 years old. That's what?

1128
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,880
大概是被蜜蜂蟄
A bee sting.

1129
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,060
對
Oh, yeah.

1130
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,620
對20歲的人來說  大概是彈片濺到
20 years old, shrapnel.

1131
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,370
對40歲的人來說  是疾病
40 years old, disease.

1132
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,980
或許那種讓你身上機械部分多於肉體部分的那種
Maybe the kind that leaves you more machine than man.

1133
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,420
慫貨不會變老
Yeah, getting old's not for sissies.

1134
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,110
所以我奶奶以前經常...
That's what my Grandma Ginny used to...

1135
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,330
我有個單子
I've got a list.

1136
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,070
我們要按照上面的順序來
We're gonna work down it.

1137
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:47,770
一起
Together.

1138
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,990
首先我要掰彎點東西
Number one, I'm gonna bend something.

1139
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,340
有些原本不該彎的東西
Something that was not meant to bend.

1140
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,520
你還是就此打住吧
I'm gonna stop you right there

1141
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,870
我肯定堅持不到第二條
because I'm not gonna make it to two.

1142
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,220
我連第一條都堅持不到
I won't even make it to one.

1143
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,000
我受不了痛苦
I don't do well with pain, you know.

1144
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,390
如果撞到腳趾頭  那我一天就毀了
If I stub my toe, I'm done for the day.

1145
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,830
我喜歡的《費麗絲蒂》被取消時我都哭了
I cried when they canceled Felicity.

1146
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,700
我真正害怕時  會因為緊張而勃起
When I get really scared, I get nervous erections.

1147
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,140
現在我就勃起了
I have one right now.

1148
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,750
你別看  越看我越勃起
Don't look. It'll only make it worse.

1149
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:10,920
我不想讓你傷害我
I don't want you to hurt me,

1150
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,140
你想知道的事我都會告訴你
and I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

1151
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,280
除了他們在哪裡
Except for where they are.

1152
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,180
羅素在一個車隊裡  在傑瑞大根大道
Russell's in a convoy heading southbound

1153
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,640
往南行使
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1154
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,370
那怪物跟他們在一起  我可不想招惹他
The monster's with them. I wouldn't fuck with him.

1155
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:21,890
你們都知道計劃
You all know the plan.

1156
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,680
攔截車隊
Intercept the convoy,

1157
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,720
救出男孩  但方式要對
grab the boy. But not inappropriately!

1158
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:26,320
知道嗎
You know what,

1159
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,680
我也不想招惹死侍
I wouldn't fuck with Deadpool either.

1160
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,860
因為他組建了一個隊伍  他所向無敵
Because he's built a team. He's unstoppable.

1161
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,600
他屁股裡有支筆  他會用那個捅你
He has an ass pen. He'll stab you with it.

1162
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,250
小心這個傢伙  電索
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1163
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,560
他很矮  一米八  不跟漫畫裡一樣
He's very short, 5'11". Not like in the comics.

1164
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,700
如果我們成功  我們就早回家
And if we succeed, we all go home early.

1165
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,520
所以如果你去對付他們  電索  我警告你
So if you go after them, Cable, I warn you...

1166
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,310
注意大風
there's a wind advisory in effect.

1167
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,060
上面風有點大
A little turbulent up here.

1168
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,240
我不是很瞭解這個叫電索的夥計
I don't know much about this Cable fella...

1169
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,680
不過我保證  他殺的人
but I guarantee he hasn't killed

1170
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,460
肯定不如黑素瘤害死的人多
as many people as melanoma has.

1171
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,250
就快到了
We're getting close!

1172
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,990
作為前X戰警...
As a former X-Man...

1173
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,950
-是實習生  -謝謝  喧囂
- Trainee. - Thank you, Bedlam.

1174
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:21,340
我一直都震驚於那夥人名字中
I was always appalled by the blatant sexism

1175
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,000
如此赤裸裸的性別歧視
in the group's name.

1176
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,090
X戰警[男人]  非得男人嗎
X-Men! Men!

1177
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,130
重點是  我們要有前瞻性思維
The point is, our group will be forward thinking.

1178
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,480
性別中立
Gender neutral.

1179
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,830
此後我們就叫...
From now on, we'll be known as...

1180
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,440
X特攻隊
X-Force.

1181
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,270
是不是有點山寨啊
Isn't that a little derivative?

1182
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,710
我沒問你的意見  皮特
I don't recall asking your opinion, Peter!

1183
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,410
不是我說的
That wasn't me.

1184
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,810
降到1300英尺開始跳
Hang the laundry out at 1,300 feet...

1185
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,680
攔截車隊  救出男孩
intercept the convoy, and grab the boy.

1186
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,810
來場大屠殺吧  寶貝兒
Let's bring on the carnage, baby!

1187
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,730
把我放到地面  瞧好吧
Get me on the ground, watch me go!

1188
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,640
太想去殺人了
I can't wait to kill!

1189
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:05,170
我想說我真的為這支隊伍驕傲
I just wanna say how proud I am of this team.

1190
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,080
你們看起來棒極了
You know, you guys look amazing!

1191
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,000
消隱者  毫無疑問你看起來也很棒
Vanisher, I have no doubt you look amazing too.

1192
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,180
這是我一直
This is the family

1193
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,610
夢想擁有的大家庭 我...
that I've always dreamed of having and I...

1194
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,740
見鬼
Ah, shit.

1195
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,050
我有時候會突然就說不下去了
I just get a little choked up sometimes.

1196
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,920
我不想打斷  不過有人
I hate to interrupt, but is anybody nervous

1197
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,320
對大風緊張嗎
about the high winds?

1198
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,710
-蓋瑞  -我叫皮特
- Gary. - My name's Peter.

1199
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,670
我知道你第一次幹這種事  不過儘管放鬆
I realize that you're new to this, but relax.

1200
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,370
你是被至高權力選中的人
You've been chosen by a higher power.

1201
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,720
-他剛才說自己是上帝嗎  -好像是
- Did he just call himself God? - I think he did.

1202
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,330
-我想回家  -我還想
- I'd like to go home. - And I'd like...

1203
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,890
麥當勞烤汁豬排堡全年供應呢
the McRib to be available year round,

1204
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,760
但有時候夢想不會成真
but sometimes dreams don't come true.

1205
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:37,980
我在特種部隊待了十年
I spent 10 years in Special Forces.

1206
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,160
你以為我們會因為一點小風
You think we didn't jump out of the plane

1207
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,160
就不從飛機裡跳下去嗎
because of a light breeze?

1208
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,470
你別無可去了  小鬍子
You're in this shit now, Mustache!

1209
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:45,470
我大喊只是為了給其他人看
I'm only yelling to impress the other guys.

1210
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,820
我絕不會讓你出事的  小甜心
I'd never let anything happen to you, Sugarbear.

1211
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,080
萊納德  來吧
Leonard, hit it!

1212
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:00,830
跳  跳  跳
Go! Go! Go!

1213
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,960
來爽一把
Let's get some!

1214
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,270
車隊在12點鐘方向  聽我口令
Convoy, 12 o'clock! On my command!

1215
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,790
部署  搞什麼
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

1216
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,280
有點偏離軌道
Little off course here.

1217
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,280
我勒個大操
Holy mommy fucking shit!

1218
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,460
他們在那裡
Ah, there they are.

1219
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,110
看這些華麗的混蛋
Look at these gorgeous sons of bitches.

1220
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,070
好樣的  喧囂
Oh, yeah! That's right, Bedlam!

1221
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:16,430
不  真他娘操蛋
No! Tripping motherfucking billies!

1222
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,560
裡碎星  你可以的
Shatterstar. Okay, you got this.

1223
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:21,390
往左
Left!

1224
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,780
往左
Left!

1225
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,090
這種天氣還要起飛  肯定是瘋了
You'd have to be insane to take off in this.

1226
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,350
不對  是左邊  白癡
No, stage left, you idiot!

1227
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,790
好吧  看來我們找到了
Well, I guess we found something

1228
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,930
你不擅長的東西
you're not better at.

1229
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,450
消隱者
Vanisher.

1230
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,280
或許風吹不毀它看不到的東西
Maybe the wind can't blow what it can't see.

1231
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:43,850
不是吧
Oh! Really?

1232
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,240
好吧  四個人也可以
All right, we could do this with four.

1233
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,290
小甜心  你可以的  夥計
Sugarbear. You got this, buddy!

1234
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,420
好樣的  這才是X特攻隊精神
That's the stuff! That's the X-Force spirit!

1235
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,730
不要低估一個留小鬍子的人
Never underestimate a man with a mustache!

1236
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,340
不信隨便找布魯克林的人問問
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

1237
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:57,560
我們成功了
We did it!

1238
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,170
你絕對是超級英雄
You're a goddamn superhero, you!

1239
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,300
X特攻隊
X-Force!

1240
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,000
X特攻隊
X-Force.

1241
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,010
皮特
Peter.

1242
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,360
我來救你  夥計
I got you, buddy!

1243
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,580
-你不會有事的  -糟糕了
- You're gonna be fine! - This is not good, man!

1244
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,930
你可以的  大兄弟  加油  皮特
You got this, big guy! Here we go, Peter!

1245
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,450
看著我  我們是X特攻隊  對吧
Look at me. We're X-Force, right?

1246
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:21,580
-對  我們是  -我們是X特攻隊
- Yeah, we're X-Force. - We're X-Force.

1247
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,680
蒼天  搞什麼
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

1248
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,720
該死的酸性嘔吐物
Fucking acidic vomit!

1249
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:34,070
天啊  我要吐在面具裡了
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up in my mask.

1250
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,560
我到達車隊上方了
Okay, I'm over the convoy.

1251
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,040
隊伍其他人都降落在哪裡了
Where did the rest of the team land?

1252
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,740
好消息和壞消息
Good news and bad news.

1253
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,910
壞消息是整個隊伍的人都死了
Bad news is the whole team is dead.

1254
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,260
好消息是
The good news is,

1255
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,130
我覺得不會有人懷念碎星的
I don't think anyone's gonna miss Shatterstar.

1256
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,530
他有點混蛋  不過保羅
He was a bit of a prick. Oh, but Paul!

1257
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:54,570
皮特
Peter!

1258
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,100
皮特  我最懷念的會是他
Peter, I'm gonna miss him most.

1259
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,270
不過還有一丟丟可能
But there is a slight chance

1260
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:58,660
消隱者能成功落地
Vanisher could make it.

1261
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,320
可能為零了  他死了
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

1262
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,540
全軍覆沒
The whole team?

1263
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,450
只剩主力了  我們還是可以的
Only the main ones. We're still good.

1264
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,760
操  你個蠢貨
Fuck, you are dumb.

1265
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,450
策劃這些特技表演的人
Whoever planned this stunt's

1266
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,670
肯定抽了很多大麻
been smoking a lot jazz cabbage.

1267
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,850
我話放這兒了
I'll tell you that much.

1268
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,550
那不是顯而易見
That's pretty obvious!

1269
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,330
看起來不錯  消隱者
Looking good, Vanisher.

1270
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:26,040
他們進入隧道了
They're headed into the tunnel.

1271
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,520
我是那個孩子的唯一希望
I'm that kid's only hope,

1272
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,430
不要輕舉妄動  等我的口令
so sit tight and wait for my word.

1273
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,480
隨便
Whatever.

1274
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,050
要跟丟他們了  我要落地了
We're gonna lose 'em. I'm dropping in.

1275
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,480
不行  唯一的倖存者
Uh, that's a negative, sole survivor.

1276
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:39,050
幸運不是超能力  我們完蛋了
Luck is not a superpower! We are so fucked!

1277
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:42,180
不  我們當然沒有完蛋
No, we most certainly are not fucked.

1278
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,930
說真的  我搞不懂
Seriously, I don't get it!

1279
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,450
你是從眼睛裡發射幸運鐳射的嗎
What, you shoot luck lasers out of your eyes?

1280
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,460
我真的很難想像
It's just it's hard to picture.

1281
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,590
而且很沒有觀影性
And certainly not very cinematic.

1282
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,900
運氣  不是吧
I mean, luck?

1283
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,510
什麼樣的扯淡胡鬧
What coked out, glass pipe-sucking

1284
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,900
神經病漫畫家
freakshow comic book artist...

1285
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,600
才會想出這種橋段
came up with that little chestnut?

1286
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,910
大概是個連腳都不會畫的傢伙
Probably a guy who can't draw feet!

1287
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,910
{\an8}指死侍漫畫作者羅伯·萊菲爾德  作品出了名的腿部比例奇怪

1288
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,310
任務又一次全部落到了我的肩上
Once again, it all falls on my shoulders.

1289
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,580
所以我才被詛咒成為獨行俠
It's why I'm cursed to be a solo act.

1290
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:25,620
-在地球...  -我就位了
- Wander the Earth... - I'm in.

1291
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,190
抱歉  你說什麼
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1292
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:28,360
我就位了
I'm in.

1293
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,280
你怎麼就就位了
How in the fuck are you in already?

1294
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,540
見鬼
Oh, shit.

1295
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,800
是電索  12點鐘方向
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

1296
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,980
好的
Okay.

1297
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,460
新計劃  用你所有的想像力
New plan. Use all of your imaginary powers

1298
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,240
阻止電索殺死那個孩子
to stop Cable from killing that kid.

1299
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:41,900
我從你六點鐘方向來了
I'm coming up on your six.

1300
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,210
那把槍太讚了
That gun is amazing!

1301
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,400
混球
Hey! Asshole!

1302
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,050
他在哪裡  我看不到他
Where is he? I can't see him.

1303
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,830
他在你上面
He's on top of you.

1304
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,750
他把你撕開了
He's tearing you open!

1305
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,710
他從後面進去了
He's going in through the back!

1306
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,880
天啊  他進去了
Oh, God, he's inside!

1307
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,230
你知道自己在說什麼吧
You hear yourself, right?

1308
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,710
不小心雙關了
Accidental double entendres!

1309
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,280
羅素  羅素·柯林斯
Russell! Russell Collins!

1310
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,240
別碰那個孩子  約翰·康納
Hands off that kid, John Connor!

1311
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,240
不不不
No, no, no!

1312
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,680
該死
Shit!

1313
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,580
兩個人可以玩那個遊戲
Two can play that game!

1314
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,540
來了  失敗了
Got it! No, I don't.

1315
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,580
好戲該上演了  美女
Showtime, mama!

1316
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,240
幸運女神  你來開車
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

1317
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,840
我應該問問你是誰  不過你馬上就要死了
I'd ask who you are, but you'll be dead in a second.

1318
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,980
我是多米諾  我表示懷疑
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

1319
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,560
堅持住  多米諾
Hang in there, Doms!

1320
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,560
這樣真的太難了
Oh, this is really hard.

1321
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,180
把我的滑雪球幣還給我
And give me back my Skee-Ball token.

1322
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,280
-你表現很棒  -X特攻隊
- You're doing great. - X-Force.

1323
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,280
看來迴響貝斯永遠不死
I guess dubstep never dies.

1324
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,250
你殺了布萊克·湯姆  你個種族主義混蛋
You killed Black Tom, you racist son of a bitch!

1325
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,170
這就不走運了
That's unfortunate.

1326
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,690
剎車壞了
We got no brakes!

1327
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,960
想辦法
Figure it out!

1328
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:57,880
沒有我殺不死的東西
There's nothing I can't kill.

1329
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,230
正如男童子軍團長凱文所說
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin used to say...

1330
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,620
"凡事總有第一次  孩子"
"There's a first time for everything, son."

1331
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,890
把你的本事使出來吧  獨眼龍
Give me your best shot, One-Eyed Willy.

1332
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,690
那些子彈還真快啊
Those bullets were, like, super fast.

1333
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,250
來吧
Here we go.

1334
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,600
多米諾  慢一點好嗎
Domino, mind slowing us down?

1335
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,780
沒辦法了
Here goes nothing.

1336
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,680
叮咚
Knock, knock.

1337
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:13,250
好樣的
That's my boy.

1338
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,870
我的天...
Holy...

1339
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,750
首先我要承認
I'll be first to admit...

1340
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,150
這跟計劃中不太一樣
this did not go according to plan.

1341
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,060
我還要首先承認
I'll also be the first to admit that

1342
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:39,980
計劃是用蠟筆寫的
that plan was written in crayon.

1343
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,280
看來羅素找到了新朋友  傑裡
Looks like Russell found a new friend. Jelly.

1344
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:44,940
事實證明  多米諾是個狠角色
Turns out Domino's a bit of a badass,

1345
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,900
或許還有點走運
and maybe, possibly mildly lucky.

1346
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:51,210
但是電索  那傢伙真是情緒太大了
But Cable? Ugh. That guy's in a mood.

1347
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,470
而且他的情緒
A mood that is

1348
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,300
馬上就會更大
about to get significantly worse.

1349
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,500
感覺非常非常不對勁
Something is so terribly, terribly wrong.

1350
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,370
蒼天  好疼
Oh, God, that hurt.

1351
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,030
去死吧  梅爾·吉布森
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

1352
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,680
羅素
Russell.

1353
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,470
羅素
Russell!

1354
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,170
羅素  你在哪裡
Russ, where are ya?

1355
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,000
羅素  羅素  你沒事
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

1356
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,480
謝天謝地  天啊
Oh, thank God. Oh, my God!

1357
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:51,870
紅坦克
Juggernaut!

1358
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,100
我就知道是你
I thought that was you!

1359
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:57,970
我應該穿白褲子來的
I should've worn my white pants.

1360
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:01,840
可能你已經見怪不怪了  但我是你的鐵桿粉絲
You probably get this a lot, but I am a huge fan.

1361
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,190
《X戰警  神秘版》183期  《雷神》411期
Uncanny X-Men183. Thor411.

1362
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,590
《X戰警  無限》12期
X-Men Unlimited12.

1363
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:08,760
我一直都夢想
You know, it has always been a dream of mine...

1364
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,590
看到你衝向我想殺我時...
to see my face reflected in your helmet...

1365
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,850
在你的頭盔上映出我自己的臉
as you charge at me with murderous intent.

1366
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,680
我不是指現在
I don't mean right now.

1367
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,640
我要馬上把你撕成兩半
I'm gonna rip you in half now.

1368
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,030
這話真有紅坦克的風格
That is such a Juggernaut thing to say.

1369
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:27,130
天啊  我感受不到自己的腿了
Oh, my God! I can't feel my legs.

1370
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,260
我感受不到...
I can't feel...

1371
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,740
不  腿在這裡
Oh, no, they're right here.

1372
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:33,350
找到了  天啊  羅素
Got 'em. God, Russell.

1373
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,740
我有自己的任務
I have a mission.

1374
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:37,360
復仇
To get my revenge.

1375
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,710
我要活活燒死那個院長
I'm going to burn that headmaster alive.

1376
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,970
你不是復仇的料
You're not the revenge type.

1377
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,540
我一個朋友是這麼說的
Take it from a friend.

1378
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:47,410
朋友  你有難的時候我保護了你
Friend? You were sick, and I protected you.

1379
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,630
你自己親口說的
You said it yourself.

1380
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:52,370
"我不是你的朋友  找個更強大的人"
"I'm not your friend. Find someone stronger."

1381
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:53,850
所以我找了
So I did.

1382
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,550
羅素  當時我沒能保護你
Russell, I couldn't protect you back then.

1383
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:01,600
但現在我能了  你想讓我說什麼
But I can now. What do you want me to say, huh?

1384
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,510
"我在乎你"嗎  真是的
"I care about you"? 'Cause goddamn it,

1385
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,990
我在乎你  羅素
I care about you, Russell.

1386
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,130
紅坦克有什麼我沒有的
What's Juggernaut got that I don't have?

1387
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:11,870
別說是腿  我就知道你會說是腿
Don't you say legs! I know you're gonna say legs!

1388
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:14,700
-腿  -聽你說出來我還是很心痛
- Legs! - Still hurts to hear out loud!

1389
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:19,830
那是什麼  那不是真繩子
What is that? That's not a real rope!

1390
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,180
你給我回來  年輕人
You get back here, young man!

1391
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,620
多米諾
Doms!

1392
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,880
多米諾  帶我離開  拜託
Doms, get me out of here, please.

1393
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:29,320
把我的胳膊當成背帶
Use my arms as backpack straps.

1394
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,150
我們可能找到
I think we may have found

1395
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:35,370
你在此的宇宙原因了
your cosmic reason for being here.

1396
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,200
我很確定不是這個
I'm pretty sure this isn't it.

1397
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,500
X特攻隊
X-Force.

1398
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,870
沒有沒希望的孩子
No child is hopeless.

1399
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:57,390
-別放棄那個男孩  -他怎麼能就那樣離開
- Don't give up on the boy. - How could he just walk away?

1400
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,130
他眼神中充滿冷漠
It was the coldness in his eyes.

1401
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,740
你應該聽聽他怎麼說的
You should've heard it.

1402
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,970
看來家人真的是臟話
I guess family really is an F-word.

1403
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,100
揉揉我的腿  媽媽
Rub my legs, Mama.

1404
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,540
為什麼要揉你的腿
Why would I rub your legs?

1405
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,490
拜託  很疼  我這是生長痛
Please, they hurt. I have growing pains.

1406
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:18,280
這是...
What in the...

1407
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:21,070
你的手為什麼又這麼小了
Why is your hand so tiny again?

1408
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,940
那不是我的手
That's not my hand.

1409
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,330
蒼天大地我的娘啊
Oh! Mary, mother of Joseph!

1410
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,290
我不介意
That was nice for me.

1411
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,160
韋德  我聽說車隊的事了...
Wade! I heard what happened with the convoy and...

1412
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,910
你還是蓋起來吧 
Why wouldn't you cover that up?

1413
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:39,170
真正的勇士沒有什麼可羞恥的
A warrior has nothing to be ashamed of.

1414
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,170
但你有  你自己看看
Yeah, but you do. Look at you.

1415
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,220
你只用襯衫蓋著自己的弟弟
You're just straight shirt-cocking it,

1416
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,740
跟蹣跚學步的小孩一樣
toddler-style.

1417
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,750
對  完全小熊維尼風
Oh, yeah. Full Winnie the Pooh.

1418
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,790
到底怎麼了  描述一下
The hell's happening? Describe it.

1419
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,100
換做我我可不會讓他那麼做
I wouldn't ask him to do that, if I were you.

1420
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,750
-就是...  -好吧
- It's like, um... - Here we go.

1421
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,060
就好像他在用屁眼生孩子
It's like he was giving birth anally,

1422
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,620
但是生到一半停住了
but they quit halfway through.

1423
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:55,800
腿都出來了  然後孩子說
They got the legs out, and they said,

1424
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,190
"算了  我不想出來了"
"You know what, I'm done."

1425
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:58,500
高興了嗎
Happy?

1426
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,630
就好像他腰以下是個木偶
It's like he's a Muppet from the waist down.

1427
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:00,850
但這次  你可以看到
But this time, you can see

1428
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,330
木偶的雞雞
the Muppet's dick.

1429
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,890
木偶格羅弗有個小樹枝一樣的老二
Grover's got a cock the size of a twig.

1430
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,110
狐貍先生  我不能再被抓到並排停車了
Mr. Weasel, I can no longer be double-parked.

1431
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,630
我已經收到三張罰單了
I've had three tickets already.

1432
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,030
不不不  死侍  你又來
No, no, no, DP, not again!

1433
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:13,690
以前這樣過嗎
This has happened before?

1434
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,210
天啊  要麼吐出來  要麼嚥下去
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

1435
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,560
你這猶豫不決快把我搞瘋了
The indecision is killing me.

1436
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,470
上帝為什麼不奪走我的聽力
Why couldn't God take my hearing?

1437
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,000
淡定  正在長回來
Cool your pits. They're growing back.

1438
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,000
我說得是你的臉
I'm talking about your face.

1439
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,960
我第一次見你不戴面具
I've never seen you without your mask before.

1440
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,220
-蒼天  -像個牛油果
- Jesus Christ! - Looks like an avocado.

1441
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,180
不過你的腿很可愛
Your legs, though, they're cute.

1442
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,010
想借條褲子穿嗎
You wanna borrow a pair of pants?

1443
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,190
很高興大家都來了
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

1444
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,930
你們肯定好奇我什麼不叫你們來
You must be wondering why I didn't call you here.

1445
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:41,580
我來告訴你我來的原因
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1446
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,980
"時間旅行者的妻子"的丈夫
"The Time Traveler's Wife's" husband...

1447
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,240
差點把我揍死了
beat me within an inch of my life.

1448
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,630
他狠狠折磨了我
He was torturing me!

1449
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:49,550
但我就只告訴了他他想知道的事
But all I told him was everything he wanted to know.

1450
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:52,250
所以我是來幫忙做準備的
So, I'm here to help us gear up.

1451
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,420
我們好不帶我去找他算賬
So we can go after him without me.

1452
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,860
不
No!

1453
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,250
我一個人去
I'm doing this alone.

1454
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:57,420
紅坦克
The Juggernaut

1455
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,900
-會把你們都殺了  -好吧
- will kill you all. - Fair enough.

1456
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,820
再給我幾個小時  讓我把腿
I just need a couple of hours to get some legs

1457
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:01,990
-長回來  -你要怎麼做
- under me. - What will you do?

1458
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,340
我不管那孩子怎麼對我
I don't care what the kid did to me.

1459
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:04,740
我絕不會讓電索抓到他
I ain't letting Cable get to him,

1460
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,130
即使我得像泡茶包一樣把他弄死
even if I have to teabag him to death.

1461
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:08,220
你現在可能只能去喝口茶
It's really just a sip of tea at this point.

1462
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,050
閉嘴  黑人黑寡婦  我正文思泉湧
Zip it, black Black Widow! I'm flowing.

1463
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:11,130
現在的第一件事是
The first order of business is

1464
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,570
把我帶到電索面前
to get me in front of Cable...

1465
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:14,010
讓我把他的血都放干
so I can pull all the fucking blood out of his body...

1466
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:16,400
把他的骨頭做成節日紀念品
and fashion his bones into holiday jewelry.

1467
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,270
然後我會剝了他的皮
Then, I'm gonna take his skin...

1468
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,360
撐開放在自製交配石首魚上面
and stretch it out over a homemade mating drum.

1469
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,540
他就站在你們身後  是嗎
He's standing right behind you, isn't he?

1470
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,250
搞什麼
What in the ass?

1471
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:38,600
這間公寓的地址在約炮軟件上嗎
Is this apartment listed on Tinder? Grindr?

1472
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,690
你挑錯地方惹事了  未來小子
You picked the wrong shithole to fuck, future boy.

1473
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:44,250
真的有那個必要嗎
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

1474
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,300
不  那只是他的本能
No. It's his "Basic Instinct."

1475
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:51,090
你有什麼事
What can we help you with?

1476
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,780
我是來找你求歡[建議]的
I'm here to proposition you.

1477
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,400
蒼天啊
Oh, boy!

1478
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,480
他真是夠幽默啊
He's really teeing it up, isn't he?

1479
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:58,660
誰來開第一個玩笑
Who gets to make the first joke?

1480
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,050
我們還是同時來吧
I think we should all do it at the same time.

1481
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,140
好主意
Good call.

1482
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,750
45刀給你口
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

1483
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:04,010
只能穿著褲子用嘴來
I only do over the pants, mouth stuff.

1484
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,190
操
Fuck!

1485
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,320
《關鍵協議[求歡]》裡
The Proposition has a wonderful

1486
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,670
蓋·皮爾斯有精彩表現
Guy Pearce performance.

1487
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,450
等等  等等  我要自己重新來過
Wait, wait, wait! I wanna do mine over.

1488
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,110
-你再說一遍  -我需要你的幫助
- Give us the line again. - I need your help!

1489
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:14,460
相信我  我比你還不開心
Trust me, I'm even less happy about this than you are...

1490
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,640
但你把紅坦克放出來了  蠢逼
but you unleashed the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1491
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,070
我一個人贏不了他
I can't bring him down alone.

1492
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,640
所以只能這樣了
So here we are.

1493
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,770
很不幸  我們X特攻隊
We're no longer accepting applications

1494
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,250
不接受申請了
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1495
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,730
即使我們接受
Even if we were...

1496
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,430
還有大風警告  要持續到至少...
there's a wind advisory in effect until at least...

1497
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,740
我們時間不多
We don't have a lot of time.

1498
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,520
你的朋友馬上就開殺戒了
Your friend's about to make his first kill.

1499
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,090
恕我直言  如果你知道的這麼多
No offense, but if you know so much...

1500
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:37,000
為什麼不穿越回他是個嬰兒的時候把他殺了
why not travel back to when he was a baby, kill him then?

1501
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,090
或者可以再穿越回去一點
Or better yet, head back a little further,

1502
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:39,220
直接殺了嬰兒希特勒
kill baby Hitler.

1503
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:41,220
我用一個設備穿越時空
I use a device to slide through time.

1504
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,920
我穿越的越久  設備就越難控制
The longer I travel, the harder it is to control.

1505
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,580
我只能充兩次電  一次讓我來
I got two charges: one to get me here,

1506
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,800
一次讓我回去
one to get me home.

1507
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,010
好吧
Well.

1508
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,970
這種寫法也太懶了
That's just lazy writing.

1509
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,280
今晚那個男孩就要
Your boy's gonna kill the headmaster

1510
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,890
殺死孤兒院院長
of the orphanage tonight.

1511
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:56,060
之後他就會嘗到其中的甜頭
After that, he gets a real taste for it.

1512
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:58,850
就像十歲的克爾斯滕·鄧斯特  該死
Like 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1513
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:00,900
所以他一直殺人
So he keeps killing...

1514
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,420
一直殺啊殺啊殺
and killing, and killing,

1515
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,990
殺啊殺
and killing.

1516
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:07,250
直到有一天他殺錯了人
Until one day, he kills the wrong fucking people.

1517
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,210
我的人
My people.

1518
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:16,390
放鬆
Relax.

1519
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:18,830
我只是要從工具袋裡拿東西
I'm retrieving something from my utility bag.

1520
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:21,440
那是個該死的腰包
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1521
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,090
你很清楚  你這個變態的混蛋
and you know it, you sick son of a bitch!

1522
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,790
根本是天差地別
The difference is night and day.

1523
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,880
你讓我想起我妻子
You remind me of my wife.

1524
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,400
什麼
I'm sorry.

1525
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:32,540
我說你讓我想起我妻子
I said, "You remind me of my wife."

1526
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,930
很遺憾你這麼說時
No, I'm sorry that you said that...

1527
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,760
正在跟我眼神接觸  而且還塗著唇膏
while making heavy eye contact and applying lip balm.

1528
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,980
她一直很掙扎
She always struggled.

1529
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:40,540
但她很風趣
But she was funny...

1530
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:43,940
所以用幽默的三稜鏡過濾自己的痛苦
and filtered her pain through the prism of humor.

1531
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:46,200
這我永遠都學不會
Something I could never master.

1532
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,340
她的死是我的錯
It was my fault she died.

1533
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:54,600
阻止他那樣的人是我的職責
It was my job to stop people like him.

1534
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,600
我有幾次就快成功了
I came close a few times.

1535
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,480
他對此不太高興
He wasn't too happy about that.

1536
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:05,400
他想傷害我
He was trying to hurt me...

1537
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,400
他也知道應該怎麼做
and he knew exactly how to do it.

1538
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,140
賜福於那些
Blessed are the wicked

1539
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:14,750
被我所治癒的邪惡之人
who are healed by my hand.

1540
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:20,240
他來到我家
He came into my home...

1541
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,150
帶走了唯一讓那成為家的東西
and took the only thing that made it a home.

1542
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:28,720
聽起來熟悉嗎
Sound familiar?

1543
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,420
很遺憾
I'm sorry.

1544
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,120
真的很遺憾
No, I'm really sorry.

1545
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,470
但那不是羅素
But that isn't Russell.

1546
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:39,430
-他可以不成為那樣  -如果你知道我知道的...
- It doesn't have to be him. - If you knew what I knew...

1547
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:41,470
他是有憤怒問題
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1548
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,080
還有點輕微學習障礙
maybe a small learning disability...

1549
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:44,520
嚴重糖尿病
splash of diabetes...

1550
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,910
但那都是可以處理好的
but nothing that can't be fixed.

1551
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,610
如果你能穿越回去
If you could go back...

1552
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,350
阻止殺你女朋友的人  你會去做嗎
and stop the people that took your girl, would you?

1553
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,880
不
No.

1554
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,660
我會請他們去嫖一頓
I'd buy them all a bouquet of hand jobs.

1555
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:55,450
廢話  我當然會
Of course I fucking would!

1556
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:57,360
但我不會殺一個小孩子
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1557
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,450
我沒讓你殺小孩子
I'm not asking you to kill a kid!

1558
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:01,060
我會殺他
I'll kill the kid.

1559
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,580
我是讓你拯救成千上萬其他孩子
I'm asking you to save hundreds of other kids.

1560
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,980
羅素會燒燬那個孤兒院
Russell's gonna burn down that orphanage.

1561
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,070
我可以想像你死去的女朋友
And I can imagine your dead girlfriend...

1562
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:11,370
肯定想讓你做對的事  對吧
would want you to do the right thing, wouldn't she?

1563
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:15,550
什麼是對的事  帥哥
So, what's it gonna be, handsome?

1564
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,340
給我個機會拯救他
Give me a chance to save him.

1565
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,820
-什麼  -你說...
- What? - You said...

1566
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:20,510
他一旦開殺戒  就會嘗到甜頭
once he kills someone, he gets a taste for it.

1567
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,910
如果我們在他開殺戒前找到他...
If we can get to him before that happens...

1568
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,600
答應我  你會給我機會
promise you'll give me a chance

1569
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,520
讓他走上不同的路
to put him on a different path.

1570
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,740
定義一下"機會"
Define "Chance."

1571
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,000
我不知道   要救一個人的靈魂
I don't know. How long does it take

1572
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,390
需要多久  那不是...
to save someone's soul? That's not...

1573
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,700
我給你30秒
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1574
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,790
-不行  -這是最多了
- What? No! - Best I can do.

1575
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,140
不要這個機會就算了
Take it or leave it.

1576
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,060
他站起來了
He's doing it!

1577
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,720
看那個小傢伙  他站起來了
Look at the little fella. He's doing it.

1578
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,720
他來了
There he goes.

1579
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,240
蒼天啊
Jesus Christ!

1580
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,760
用襯衫蓋著呢
Just shirt-cocking it.

1581
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:57,120
好樣的  小傢伙
There you go, little fella.

1582
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,550
加油  你做得很好
Go on, you're doing it!

1583
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,470
我漂亮  沒毛  蹣跚學步的小男孩
My beautiful, hairless, Twizzler-legged baby boy.

1584
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,780
蒼天
Christ!

1585
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,520
不忍直視
That's disturbing.

1586
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,950
30秒
30 seconds.

1587
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,830
-成交  -成交
- Deal. - Deal.

1588
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:32,810
{\an8}大碼先生

1589
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:25,360
太煩了  他們竟然沒有你的尺碼
Man, that sucks they didn't have anything in your size.

1590
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,410
我真的想跟你穿得很搭
I really wanted to match, you know?

1591
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,500
作為一個惡人小隊
Being a menacing team.

1592
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,710
真是糟糕透了
Oh, man, it sucks.

1593
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,630
確實很讓人不爽  孩子
That was some cold-ass shit, kid.

1594
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,590
那只是前列腺高潮的
And that is just the first five steps

1595
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,330
前五個步驟
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

1596
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,680
我們這是去哪裡
Where the hell are we going?

1597
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,070
你自己說的
You said it yourself.

1598
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,030
沒人能阻止紅坦克  所以我們需要幫助
Nothing can stop the Juggernaut. We need backup.

1599
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,040
我會在你敵人的血中沐浴
I will bathe in the blood of your enemies.

1600
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:53,780
能把音樂關掉嗎
Can you turn off the music?

1601
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,910
不可以
You'll do no such thing.

1602
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,830
你為什麼不用印度口音說
Why don't you just say it in an Indian accent?

1603
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,610
-什麼[不好意思]  -接受道歉
- I'm sorry? - Apology accepted.

1604
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,750
我不喜歡你這一點
This is a side of you I do not like.

1605
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:04,140
我猜猜
Let me guess,

1606
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,660
你在未來的某個兄弟是印度人
some of your best friends in the future are Indian.

1607
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:06,970
你到底在...
What the hell are you...?

1608
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:08,880
不寬容又一次抬起了醜陋的頭
Once again, intolerance rears its ugly head.

1609
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:10,230
抱歉  會好起來的
I am so sorry. It gets better.

1610
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,840
我不是種族主義者  白癡
I'm not a fucking racist, moron!

1611
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:13,930
種族主義者就會這麼說
That's precisely what a racist would say.

1612
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:15,630
這次我挺這個白人傢伙
I'm with the old white guy on this one.

1613
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:16,930
這是一大轉變
And that's a twist.

1614
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,500
等事情結束
When this is over...

1615
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,420
我會拿你斷掉的腳把你插死
I'm going to fuck you to death with your own broken feet.

1616
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,640
還有性虐待傾向  你真牛逼
And a sexual predator, too. That's rich.

1617
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,070
我該念完大學的
I should have finished college.

1618
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,250
話說你在未來
So what exactly do you

1619
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:26,330
到底是幹什麼的
do in the future, anyway, huh?

1620
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,640
某種戰士嗎
Some kind of soldier?

1621
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,510
差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

1622
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,730
我曾是特種部隊戰士
I was a soldier. Special Forces.

1623
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,470
五十年後我們肯定會成為好哥們
I bet 50 years from now, we're bestest buddies.

1624
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,520
五十年後你早死了
50 years from now, you're very dead.

1625
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,960
你們這一代把這個星球搞死了
Your entire generation fucked this planet into a coma.

1626
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,920
劇透警告
Spoiler alert.

1627
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:44,480
星球啊
Planets.

1628
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:46,090
下次還是打優步吧
Next time, Uber.

1629
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:47,440
我給你劇透一點
Here's a spoiler alert.

1630
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,580
你不是英雄
You're not a fucking hero.

1631
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:54,670
你只是個穿成性感玩具的煩人小丑
You're just an annoying clown dressed up as a sex toy.

1632
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:55,890
我有消息告訴你
Well, I got news for you.

1633
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,280
我的心放對了地方
My heart is in the right place.

1634
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,850
羅素不會殺任何人
Russell's not gonna kill anyone.

1635
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,850
因為我  他會知道真正的愛是什麼
Because of me, he's gonna know what real love looks like.

1636
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:01,980
我們都會死
We're all going to die.

1637
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,280
因為你  我會一直知道
Because of you, I'll always know

1638
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:05,290
成年人長了嬰兒蛋是什麼樣
what a grown man with baby balls looks like.

1639
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:07,720
我是個成長者  不是炫耀狂
I'm a grower, not a shower.

1640
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,940
天啊  真希望這是公交車
God, I wish this were a bus

1641
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:10,160
那樣我就可以按鈴下車了
where I could pull the string and get out.

1642
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,860
還好開車的不是電索
It's a good thing Cable's not driving,

1643
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,120
否則你就坐後排了
or you'd be in the back.

1644
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,510
-我本來就坐後排  -這裡
- I am in the back. - Right here!

1645
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,710
我錯了
I made mistakes!

1646
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,450
我想收回
I wanna take them back!

1647
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:40,450
你信任過我  我將那份信任
You trusted me. I took that trust...

1648
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,930
變成了機場衛生間裡的
and turned it into a glory hole

1649
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,540
一個口交"光榮洞"
in an airport bathroom.

1650
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:46,850
就是明尼阿波利斯那個  你知道的
The one in Minneapolis. You know the one.

1651
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,500
但連你都知道我不是個十足的混蛋
But even you know I'm not a complete piece of shit.

1652
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:51,070
我曾經是X戰警
I was once an X-Man.

1653
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,160
實習生
Trainee!

1654
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,380
你還在用我的尼龍搭扣標籤啊
You're still using my Velcro labels. Aw.

1655
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:01,040
確實比膠帶更好用
They do stick better than tape.

1656
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:02,130
你好  韋德
Hi, Wade!

1657
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:03,610
別這樣
Please don't.

1658
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,040
你想說什麼就說吧  快點
Say whatever it is you're here to say. Make it quick.

1659
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,350
好  快
Right. Quick.

1660
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:09,090
就是那個孩子  就像你  我也讓他失望了
It's the kid. Just like you, I let him down.

1661
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:10,570
就像我
And just like me,

1662
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:11,740
從沒有人為他犧牲過
he's never had anyone sacrifice anything for him...

1663
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:12,790
因為全世界很久以前
because the whole world wrote him off

1664
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,270
就把他當成垃圾放棄了
as a piece of shit a long time ago.

1665
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:16,010
他現在跟紅坦克組隊了
Look, he's teamed up with the Juggernaut!

1666
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,580
紅坦克
The Juggernaut!

1667
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,360
那是我最喜歡的漫威角色
Who's, like, my favorite Marvel character ever...

1668
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,620
你好  雪緒  謝謝你跟我打招呼
And hi, Yukio! That was really nice of you to say hi...

1669
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:23,020
所以我也跟你打個招呼
so I'm saying hi back.

1670
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,450
你們在一起真般配
You guys make a super cute couple.

1671
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,190
真的  我說到哪裡了
Yeah. Where was I?

1672
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,110
想起來了  心目中的英雄就不該見
Oh, yeah. You should never meet your heroes...

1673
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:29,850
因為說真的  他有點混蛋
because, honestly, he's a bit of a dick!

1674
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,720
跟大多數混蛋一樣  他堅硬無比
And like a lot of dicks, he's hard as a rock...

1675
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,160
而且只會惹麻煩
and causes nothing but problems!

1676
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,070
你可以阻止紅坦克  我知道你可以
Look, you can stop the Juggernaut. I know you can.

1677
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:39,340
你知道如果我幫你  我會是什麼下場嗎
Do you know what would happen to me if I helped you?

1678
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,470
我會丟臉
I would be disgraced.

1679
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:43,560
你是個犯罪分子  逃犯
You are a criminal, a fugitive.

1680
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,130
但最糟糕的是
But worst of all...

1681
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,910
你讓我心碎了  韋德
you broke my heart, Wade.

1682
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,830
那你知道嗎
Then you know what?

1683
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:51,220
你的心沒放對位置  大塊頭
Your heart's in the wrong place, big guy.

1684
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,220
做正確的事有時候會很操蛋
Doing the right thing is sometimes messy...

1685
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:58,660
完球  而且不會很方便
and fucked up, and not particularly convenient!

1686
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,790
所以你就待在你的處女城堡裡吧
So stay here in Chateau de Virgin...

1687
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,970
我們去嗨了
while we go get our fuck on!

1688
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:08,540
你表現得很好
You're doing great.

1689
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,720
你戴著頭盔是因為
So you wear that helmet because

1690
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,510
你兄弟想讀你的心嗎
your brother tries to read your mind?

1691
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:20,810
對  不過他現在坐輪椅了  我們扯平了
Yeah, but he's in a wheelchair, so even-steven.

1692
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:23,340
有人來了  是羅素  先生
Someone's coming. It's Russell, sir.

1693
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,340
而且他不是一個人
And he's not alone.

1694
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,040
保證孩子們的安全
Secure the children.

1695
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:32,220
他們不會取代我們的
They will not replace us.

1696
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:35,050
我們去大幹一場如何
What do you say we go fuck some shit up?

1697
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:38,920
"我們去大幹一場"就是我的中間名
"Let's fuck some shit up" is my legal middle name.

1698
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:44,880
你給我斷後  我對付那個老頭子
Watch my back. I've got the old man.

1699
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,490
阿門  兄弟
Amen, brother.

1700
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:54,670
是時候嗨起來了
Time to make the chimichangas.

1701
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,890
30秒
30 seconds.

1702
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,460
我終於知道為什麼來此了
I finally know why I'm here.

1703
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,460
我是在這裡被撫養長大的
I was raised in this place.

1704
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:03,770
其實不是撫養  而是折磨
Well, not raised. I was tortured.

1705
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:06,690
震驚  你來此的宇宙原因大白天下了
Wow! It's your cosmic reason for being here.

1706
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,030
-走吧  -肯定會很好玩
- Shall we? - This is gonna be fun.

1707
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,170
是啊
Yeah!

1708
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:10,600
我一直想問你
Hey! Been meaning to ask you...

1709
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:13,910
你為什麼帶著那個臟兮兮的噁心玩具熊
what's with the dirty, disgusting hobo bear?

1710
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:17,130
那不是臟東西  是我死去女兒的血
It's not dirt. It's the blood of my dead daughter.

1711
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,870
你是熊[在]嗎  上帝  我是瑪格麗特
Are You Bear, God? It's Me, Margaret.

1712
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,350
來頂個拳
Give me some.

1713
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,960
俗話說笑聲治癒一切
They say laughter heals anything...

1714
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:24,140
當然  除了那個
except, of course, that.

1715
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,400
應該打開音樂了
We should just cue the music.

1716
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,250
歡迎回家  羅素  我們很想你
Welcome home, Russell. We missed you.

1717
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,520
羅素
Russell!

1718
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,960
你不用這樣  我們談談
You don't need to do this! Let's talk!

1719
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,300
你為什麼穿成炸彈客的樣子
Why are you dressed like the Unabomber?

1720
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,290
這就是原因
That's why!

1721
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,270
我早說過  這個小混蛋無藥可救了
Told you this little fucker's too far gone.

1722
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,010
閉嘴  滅霸  我們說好了的  你...
Zip it, Thanos! We have a deal and you fuck...

1723
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,010
{\an8}喬什·布洛林既出演了電索  也是滅霸的飾演者。

1724
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,710
我要把那個出租車司機插進你的菊花裡
I'm gonna shove that cab driver right up your ass.

1725
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,020
我的身體和手都很柔軟
My body and my hands are so soft.

1726
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,280
你還是回車上吧
You should probably head back to the car.

1727
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,020
{\an8}我還是回車上吧
I think I'll head back to the car.

1728
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,890
扣動扳機的時候  槍才最好用
It works best when you pull the trigger.

1729
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,070
這把槍太讚了
That gun is amazing!

1730
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,640
說出來
Say it!

1731
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,860
你是個怪胎
You are an abomination!

1732
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:47,440
現在我要把紅色傢伙插進這個老傢伙菊花裡
Now, I'm gonna shove the red guy up the old guy.

1733
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,920
我相信他的話  分散戰鬥
I believe him! Every man for themselves!

1734
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:55,360
逮住你了
Gotcha!

1735
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,320
受死吧  侏儒
Beat it, midget!

1736
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,410
大傢伙  太陽快下山了
Hey, big guy, the sun's getting real low!

1737
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:04,540
慘了
Oh, shit fuck!

1738
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,990
過來  美人
Come here, beautiful.

1739
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,190
說出來
Say it!

1740
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:03,790
你為我而來了
You came for me.

1741
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,270
我不會放棄你的
I'm not giving up on you,

1742
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,450
你也不要放棄那個男孩
and you are not giving up on that boy.

1743
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:09,540
誰說的規矩不是用來破壞的
Who says that rules aren't meant to be broken?

1744
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:11,970
是時候用臟的了
It's time to fight dirty.

1745
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:13,370
是時候用掃堂腿了  強尼
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

1746
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:16,200
喂  挑個跟自己個頭差不多的人欺負
Hey! Pick on someone your own size!

1747
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,330
這話真是你的風格
That's such a you thing to say!

1748
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,330
去幹掉他  猛虎
Go get him, tiger!

1749
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:22,250
特效打鬥場面登場了
Big CGI fight coming up!

1750
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,700
他完全沒問題
He's doing great.

1751
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:47,970
說出來
Say it!

1752
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,540
-羅素  -對了
- Russell. - Bingo!

1753
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:00,940
看到那輛巴士了嗎
You see that bus?

1754
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:02,070
我要把它插進你菊花裡
I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

1755
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:07,510
沒錯  我要用臟的了
That's right! I'm fighting dirty!

1756
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,470
好極了
Oh, great!

1757
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:10,900
那些怪胎在那裡
There they are! Those freaks!

1758
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:13,030
一群穿著護士鞋的武裝戀童癖
A bunch of armed pedophiles in nursing shoes.

1759
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,210
能給我一把槍嗎
Can I have one of those guns?

1760
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:17,080
-不能  -好吧
- No. - That's fine.

1761
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,080
趕緊滾  變異人渣
Get off this property, mutant scum!

1762
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:20,130
那我就用這塊磚頭吧
I'm just gonna use this brick.

1763
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:21,960
盡力而為
Maximum effort.

1764
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:29,750
誰說再也沒法回家了呢
Who says you can't go home again?

1765
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,770
說出來
Say it.

1766
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:54,860
你每次折磨我時說的話  說出來
Say what you said every time you tortured me!

1767
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,730
說出來
Say it!

1768
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:59,470
賜福於那些被我所治癒的邪惡之人
Blessed are the wicked who are healed by my hand!

1769
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:02,820
賜福於那些
Blessed are the wicked...

1770
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:04,090
被我所治癒的
who are healed...

1771
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,090
邪惡之人
by my hand.

1772
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:25,850
你個共產主義混蛋
You commie motherfucker!

1773
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,440
天啊  你也感受到了嗎
Oh, my God. Did you feel that, too?

1774
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,700
只有好哥們才一起處決戀童癖
Only best buddies execute pedophiles together.

1775
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:02,930
你有30秒  你個叨逼叨逼碎碎念
You got 30 seconds, you jabbering butt plug!

1776
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:04,190
你終於上道了
Now we're getting it.

1777
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:11,150
我需要一輛巴士把你們都救出去
I need a bus to get you all out of here.

1778
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:17,460
孤兒們
Orphans.

1779
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:19,860
天啊
Oh, geez.

1780
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:23,990
是時候為你的行為付出代價了
It's time to burn for what you've done!

1781
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,520
一個孩子不該有這種力量
A child should not be burdened with such power!

1782
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:36,400
羅素  等等
Russell! Wait!

1783
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:53,060
等等  他還沒殺人
Wait! He hasn't killed anyone yet!

1784
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:55,110
-你還要等到什麼時候  -你他媽不許動他
- What more do you need to see? - Don't you fucking dare!

1785
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,330
他只是個孩子
He's just a kid!

1786
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:58,290
滴答  計時中
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

1787
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,040
我要把你化了  做成雞雞環
I'm gonna melt you down and make a cock ring.

1788
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:37,060
-我說過了  走開  -來啊
- I told you! Leave me alone! - Come on!

1789
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:38,720
聽我說
Listen to me!

1790
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,610
那是我們在
That's how we do it

1791
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,140
俄羅斯的做法
in Mother Russia.

1792
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,880
大家都說千禧一代是最難搞的
They say millennials are the hardest to reach.

1793
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:14,490
不  你做得太棒了
Oh, no. You're doing amazing.

1794
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,670
該死  做流氓的感覺真好
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta!

1795
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,540
回家吧  韋德
Go home, Wade!

1796
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:22,410
你在毀掉一切
You're ruining everything!

1797
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:29,120
我越來越擅長這個了
I'm getting good at this shit.

1798
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,470
快走  快走  快走
Go, go, go!

1799
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:35,650
他今晚死定了  韋德
He dies tonight, Wade.

1800
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:38,170
你阻止不了我
You can't stop me!

1801
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:40,080
他跑得像個變態一樣
He even runs like a fucking pervert.

1802
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:42,870
像丟失了筆記本電腦的網絡獵人
Like an online predator who lost his laptop.

1803
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,790
那把槍只剩一發子彈了
There's one bullet left in that gun.

1804
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:47,830
等等  等等  稍等一下
Wait, wait, wait! Please, just give me a second!

1805
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,350
我來搞定
I got this.

1806
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,620
-羅素  -後退  回家吧  韋德
- Russell! - Stay back! Go home, Wade!

1807
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,360
我們談談吧  不用這樣
Let's talk. It doesn't have to go this way!

1808
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,060
那坨狗屎...
That piece of shit...

1809
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,840
他對你做出那種事  確實死有餘辜
he deserves to die for what he did to you.

1810
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:01,280
他傷害了你  讓你也想傷害別人
He hurt you badly. Makes you wanna hurt others.

1811
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:03,930
但是如果你殺了他  他就贏了
But if you kill him, he wins.

1812
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:07,850
你就成了他口中的那樣  而且更糟糕
You become everything he says you are, but worse.

1813
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:09,900
你只是個孩子
You're just a kid.

1814
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,680
你不想傷害任何人
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

1815
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,990
你怎麼知道我的想法
How do you know what I want?

1816
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:14,640
因為我一直在你心裡
Because I've been inside you.

1817
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,210
我說錯了
That came out wrong.

1818
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:18,950
我一直在處於你的位置[在你鞋子裡]
I've been inside your shoes.

1819
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:20,860
這樣說也不合適
Which is also off-putting.

1820
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:22,390
這不是個很好的類比
It's not a great analogy.

1821
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:24,260
重點是...
The point is...

1822
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:26,000
有人...
there are people...

1823
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:29,090
這個該死的世界裡  除了他
There are people in this fucking world...

1824
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:31,830
還有人會好好待你
besides him, who will treat you right.

1825
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,490
現在還不晚  別那樣做
It isn't too late. Don't do it.

1826
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:42,450
我不應該把你留在那裡
I never should've left you there.

1827
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:46,060
我不應該把你留在那座監獄裡
I never should've left you in that prison.

1828
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,460
我不能相信你
I can't trust you.

1829
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,510
我不能相信任何人
I can't trust anybody!

1830
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:09,000
好孩子
Wonderful kid.

1831
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,830
你阻止不了我  韋德
You can't stop me, Wade!

1832
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,310
我還有一個主意
I got one more idea.

1833
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:18,270
這真的是個壞主意  對我也一樣
It's just a really bad one, even for me.

1834
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:19,580
韋德  你要幹什麼
Wade, what are you doing?

1835
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:21,930
好吧  這對大家都好  孩子
All right. This is for all the marbles, kid!

1836
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:24,060
你今天要殺人的話...
You're gonna kill someone today...

1837
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,540
賜福於那些...
Blessed are the wicked...

1838
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,500
...就殺我吧
...then it's gotta be me.

1839
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:30,500
...被我所治癒的邪惡之人
...who are healed by my hand!

1840
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:36,030
該死
Fuck this!

1841
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,700
告訴我  剛才用了慢鏡頭吧
Tell me they got that in slow motion.

1842
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,230
這可不太妙
Oh, that's not good.

1843
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:49,230
不  先生
No, sir.

1844
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:59,760
你為了我  犧牲了自己
You sacrificed yourself for me.

1845
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:01,370
沒錯
Yeah.

1846
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,640
這是我做過最棒的事
And it was the best thing I ever did.

1847
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:07,680
我說過  我在乎你
I told you I care about you.

1848
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:09,510
你是個好孩子  羅素
You're a good kid, Russell.

1849
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,820
那只熊
The bear.

1850
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:16,260
成功了
It worked.

1851
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:24,830
因為你
Because of you.

1852
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:27,180
不  韋德  因為你
No, Wade, because of you.

1853
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:30,140
住手  住手
Stop, stop, stop!

1854
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:31,360
住手
Stop!

1855
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:35,490
就這樣吧  好嗎
Just let it happen, okay?

1856
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:39,240
我的心終於放對了地方
I guess my heart was finally in the right place.

1857
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,670
那個字謎真難懂
That riddle is so fucked up.

1858
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,900
抱歉  抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1859
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:50,290
別這樣  別這樣
Don't be. Don't be.

1860
01:50:50,330 --> 01:50:52,550
我尋死很久了
I've been trying to make this happen for a while.

1861
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,250
求你了  不要離開我
Please, just don't leave me.

1862
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:55,910
我不想孤獨死去
I don't wanna die without an audience.

1863
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:57,600
我們不會離開的
We are not going anywhere.

1864
01:50:57,650 --> 01:50:59,740
天啊  我希望學院在看
Oh, God, I hope the Academy is watching.

1865
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:00,910
好好休息吧  好嗎
Just rest, okay?

1866
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,830
爸爸
Papa.

1867
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:07,860
*爸爸  你能聽到我嗎*
*Papa, can you hear me?*

1868
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:16,880
*爸爸  你能在夜裡找到我嗎*
*Papa, can you find me in the night*

1869
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:06,930
在我死之前...
Before I go...

1870
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:41,040
抱歉  我還有話要說
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

1871
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:43,000
多米諾
Domino.

1872
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,480
我想給你我的探險時光手錶
I want you to have my Adventure Timewatch.

1873
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,880
結果證明我才是幸運的人
Turns out that I'm the lucky one.

1874
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:54,750
謝謝
Thank you.

1875
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:59,360
少女女巫塞布麗娜 
Hey, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.

1876
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,710
我更喜歡你短髮
I liked you better with your hair short.

1877
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:02,890
大家應該也是
Think everyone did.

1878
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:06,450
-你好  雪緒  -你好  韋德  
- Hi, Yukio. - Hi, Wade!

1879
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:09,540
還有你...
And you...

1880
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:12,070
鉻骨
Chrome Bone.

1881
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:15,030
我對你來說算不上最好的朋友
I haven't always been the best friend to you.

1882
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:17,380
但你是我最好的朋友
But you've always been that to me.

1883
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:18,770
謝謝你
So thank you.

1884
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:22,560
為我說一次"操"吧
Say "Fuck" for me.

1885
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:24,690
就一次  拜託
Just once. Come on,

1886
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:26,340
我們一起說吧  沒什麼大不了
We'll do it together. It's no big deal.

1887
01:52:26,390 --> 01:52:29,430
來吧  一  二  三  操...
Here we go. One, two, three. F... F... F...

1888
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,650
操
Fuck.

1889
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,960
很享受啊  大臭嘴
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

1890
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:38,400
還有你  電索
And you, Cable.

1891
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:42,930
你回去找你的家人  韋德向他們問好
You get back to your family. You tell 'em Wade says hi.

1892
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:46,620
答應我  答應我一件事
And promise me. Promise me one thing.

1893
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,060
你不會再基於人的膚色
That you'll start judging people...

1894
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:49,500
評判一個人
not by the color of their skin,

1895
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:51,410
而是基於他們的性格內涵
but by the content of their character.

1896
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:53,760
-天啊  -羅素老兄
- Jesus. - R-Dog?

1897
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:57,420
你在這裡
There you are. Hey!

1898
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:59,680
你現在是超級英雄了  朋友
You're a superhero now, bubba.

1899
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,730
所以現在是你擁有超級裝備的時候了
That's why it's high time that you had a super suit.

1900
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:04,160
這個給你了
This one is yours.

1901
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,950
你也許想用蒸汽清洗一下
You might wanna get it steam cleaned.

1902
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:07,430
特別是褲襠周圍
Especially around the pants.

1903
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:09,170
把腰部放寬一點
And let it out a little in the waist.

1904
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:11,130
不過
But, hey.

1905
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:13,520
聽著
Look.

1906
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:16,180
家不是臟話
Family is not an F-word.

1907
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,260
是吧
All right?

1908
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:20,750
總會有你的家
There's one out there for you.

1909
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,490
繼續找  好嗎
Just keep looking, okay?

你女兒和妻子怎麼辦

現在我的家人安全了  另外  我不是為了你
Now, my family's safe. And I didn't do it for you.

Heads, you did it for me. Tails, you did it for me.

- We must get the collar off. -Forget it. It's no use.

02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:53,740
你真讓人心累
You're exhausting.

2047
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,560
我知道你是說俏皮話
I see what you did there. Puns.

2048
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:57,040
我們的大門永遠為你敞開
Our door's always open.

2049
02:01:57,090 --> 02:01:58,870
太好了  但我還沒準備好再約會
That's kind, but I'm not ready to date again.

2050
02:01:58,920 --> 02:01:59,920
更不用說跟兩個女人了
Let alone two women.

2051
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:02,750
天啊  你真是個混蛋
God, you're a douche.

2052
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:04,920
-再見  韋德  -再見  雪緒
- Bye, Wade! - Bye, Yukio!

2053
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:08,930
最後能有什麼呢
What do you get

2054
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:09,880
在你的隊伍裡有八英尺的鉻...
when you take eight feet of chrome...

2055
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:11,100
一點勇氣...
one pinch of courage...

2056
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:12,360
一點好運氣...
a cup of good luck...

2057
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:13,970
一點種族歧視...
a dab of racism...

2058
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:15,540
一點糖尿病...
a splash of diabetes...

2059
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,980
還有一個四期癌癥病人時
and a wheelbarrow full of stage four cancer?

2060
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:20,720
答案是一家人
Answer: a family.

2061
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:23,900
看到沒  我對於電影類型沒有撒謊
See? I didn't lie what kind of film this was.

2062
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:25,460
如果說今天你學到了什麼...
If there's anything you take away today...

2063
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:28,470
除了要去谷歌"迴響貝斯是什麼"
other than the need to Google, "What the fuck is dubstep?"...

2064
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:31,340
那就是我們都需要歸屬於某個人
it's that we all need to belong to someone.

2065
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:30,150
如此小的東西如何產生
How something so small generates

2066
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,760
足夠的能量讓時間倒流...
enough energy to reverse time is...

2067
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:34,200
修好它就行了  十一
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2068
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:34,200
{\an8}《怪奇物語》女主

2069
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:36,510
不然我要把它拿去天才吧
or I'll take it to the Genius Bar.

2070
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:37,770
電索知道的話會殺了你的
Cable's gonna kill you when he finds out.

2071
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:38,860
從來沒聽說過他
Never heard of him.

2072
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:40,380
我為什麼要幫他呢
Why do you think I'm helping him?

2073
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,910
上帝的行事方式很神秘
The Lord works in mysterious ways,

2074
02:04:43,950 --> 02:04:46,210
不是嗎  再見了
don't I? A good day.

2075
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:47,950
再見  韋德
Bye, Wade!

2076
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:49,480
再見  雪緒
Bye, Yukio!

2077
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:53,310
這可能不是個好主意
That was probably a bad idea.

2078
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:54,350
我們做了什麼
What have we done?

2079
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:14,940
希望我們磨快了奶油乾酪塗抹刀
I hope we sharpened the cream cheese spreader.

2080
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,510
我馬上回來
I'll be right back!

2081
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:31,040
我們一定要給我們的孩子取名雪兒
We're definitely naming our kid Cher!

2082
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:35,570
皮特
Peter!

2083
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:37,180
X特攻隊
X-Force!

2084
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:40,270
走開  快走開
Walk away! Just walk away!

2085
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:42,310
-但我們是X特攻隊  -不  我們不是
- But we're X-Force! - Nope! We're not.

2086
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:43,710
X特攻隊只是一個營銷工具
X-Force is just a marketing tool

2087
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:45,050
是福斯高管設計出來
designed by Fox executives...

2088
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,800
讓演滅霸的喬什·布洛林不失業的
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

2089
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:48,360
其實根本不存在
It doesn't exist.

2090
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:51,710
好吧  那還真是嚇人
All right, well, this has been pretty scary!

2091
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,450
而且我得去餵我的貓了
And I need to feed my cat!

2092
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:55,980
回家吧  小甜心  回家吧
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

2093
02:05:56,020 --> 02:05:59,290
好  你把我的郵箱地址給多米諾好嗎
Okay. Will you give Domino my email?

2094
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:10,340
韋德  是你嗎
Wade, is that you?

2095
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,950
看來史崔克終於
I guess Stryker finally

2096
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,390
想辦法讓你閉嘴了
figured out how to shut you up.

2097
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:25,360
是我  不要驚慌
Hey! It's me! Don't scratch!

2098
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:27,440
只是在整理時間線
Just cleaning up the timelines!

2099
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:31,320
聽著  終有一天你會收起爪子
Look, eventually you're going to hang up the claws...

2100
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,580
而那會讓很多人很傷心
and it's gonna make a lot of people very sad.

2101
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:36,710
但有一天你的老夥計韋德會讓你
But one day, your old pal Wade's gonna ask you...

2102
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,720
再重回馬背衝鋒陷陣
to get back in the saddle again.

2103
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:42,150
到那時候  記得答應
And when he does, say yes.

2104
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:45,380
知道了
Oh, right.

2105
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:47,600
愛你
Love you!

2106
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:51,600
我天  真棒
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2107
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,310
{\an8}《綠燈俠》

2108
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:00,780
不客氣  加拿大
You're welcome, Canada.

2109
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:14,490
我去
Boy howdy.

2110
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:19,280
你好  這是個小壞蛋
Hi. This is a toughie.

2111
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,760
哎呦
Yeesh.

2112
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,200
很好  你已經開始練習敬禮了啊
Oh, yes. You're already practicing your salute, huh?

2113
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:27,070
沒錯  我們會處理的  是不是
Yes, you are. Well, we'll take care of that, won't we?

2114
02:07:27,110 --> 02:07:29,900
天啊  這比我想像中難多了
Jesus Christ! This is so much harder than I thought.

2115
02:07:30,730 --> 02:07:32,380
我真受不了了
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2116
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:34,120
我們兩個都是
That makes two of us.

2117
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,770
你可以的
You can do this.

2118
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:38,470
太瘋狂了  太瘋狂了
This is crazy. This is crazy. This is crazy. This is crazy.

2119
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:39,650
好了
All right.

2120
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,820
{\an8}阿道夫·希特勒
1889年4月20日

2121
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,400
盡力而為
Maximum effort.

2122
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,390
沒事了  乖
That's okay. Let me see here.

2123
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:30,950
天啊
Oh, God.

2124
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,960
所以才說你是個小壞蛋
That's why you're such a little bastard.

2125
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,350
沒人給你換過尿布
No one's ever changed you.

2126
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:38,140
屁屁都被屎尿粘住了  是不是
Yeah, you got a big, old stinky in there, don't you?

2127
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:41,010
天啊  聞起來像希特勒的屁股
God, it smells like Hitler's anus...

2128
02:13:41,050 --> 02:13:43,620
這麼說很對  是吧  好了
which would makes sense, wouldn't it? Yeah.

2129
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:44,840
我們都知道
I think we both know

2130
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,270
我沒那麼狠心下手
I don't have what it takes to do this...

2131
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:48,490
所以我會快速給你換個尿布
so I'm just gonna change your diaper real quick...

2132
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:50,450
然後回去找我的朋友電索一起來
and then I'm gonna come back with my friend, Cable.

2133
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:51,890
他特別喜歡殺小孩子
He loves killing kids.
