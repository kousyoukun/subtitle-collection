1
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,053
<i>Fuck Wolverine.</i>

2
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,765
<i>First, he rides my
coattails with the R rating.</i>

3
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.</i>

4
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,063
<i>What a dick.</i>

5
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,357
<i>Well, guess what, Wolvie?</i>

6
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,734
<i>I'm dying in this one, too.</i>

7
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,740
<i>To understand why
I took a cat-nap</i>

8
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,909
<i>on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...</i>

9
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,285
<i>I need to take you back</i>

10
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,704
<i>to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.</i>

11
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,081
<i>I'd gone international,</i>

12
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,124
<i>taking out mass
murderers, gangsters,</i>

13
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>unspeakable monsters.</i>

14
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,671
<i>People nobody would
touch. Except me.</i>

15
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,839
<i>I'm gonna touch them all over.</i>

16
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,428
<i>Hey, it's Gail calling.</i>

17
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,596
<i>Love the shiny suit.</i>

18
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,681
<i>Really brings out</i>

19
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,307
<i>the sex trafficker in your eyes.</i>

20
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,559
Whatever they're
paying, I'll double it.

21
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,771
I don't speak
Cantonese, Mister...

22
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,816
Well, I'm not even
gonna attempt that.

23
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,527
But I did take 8th
grade Spanish, so...

24
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,696
Where is the library?

25
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,823
Which literally translates to...

26
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,243
I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker.

27
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,131
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

28
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,424
I am so sorry.

29
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,092
I thought this was an
anal-bleaching party.

30
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,158
Don't worry. You're
not going to die.

31
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,660
Although these will kill you.

32
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,745
Hit it, Dolly.

33
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,641
I'm merely a
vessel for the Lord.

34
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,489
Taking the hands out of
the guns of the criminals!

35
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,540
Whoo! Do not go in there!

36
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,341
Let's see Captain
America do that.

37
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,810
Too exotic?

38
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,500
I don't bargain.

39
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,895
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

40
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,481
Cut. I've got bad guy
blood, right in my open eye.

41
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,317
Oh, that's so gross.

42
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,736
Fuck.

43
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,739
Looks like you left a
little landing strip there.

44
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,865
I like it.

45
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,622
Oh, man!

46
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,878
<i>My world tour brought me home</i>

47
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,297
<i>to this guy, Sergei Valishnikov.</i>

48
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,924
<i>But we'll get to
him in a moment.</i>

49
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,342
<i>'Cause I know what
you're thinking.</i>

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>"I'm so glad I left
the kiddos at home."</i>

51
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,554
<i>But that's where you'd be wrong.</i>

52
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,682
<i>That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...</i>

53
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,062
<i>and, believe it or not,
Deadpom 2 is a family film.</i>

54
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,188
<i>True story.</i>

55
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,150
<i>And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.</i>

56
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,278
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

57
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,615
<i>Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.</i>

58
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,576
<i>That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.</i>

59
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,996
<i>Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?</i>

60
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,164
<i>But this guy?</i>

61
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,333
<i>He was one of the worst of 'em.</i>

62
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,504
<i>Hurry up and open
this fucking door,</i>

63
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,672
<i>and let's kill
this motherfucker!</i>

64
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,430
<i>Ugh. So gross.</i>

65
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,266
<i>A panic room? Really?</i>

66
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,936
Can you come out?

67
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,106
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

68
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,321
<i>Over and over, I
hear people say,</i>

69
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,864
<i>"I just don't have
enough confidence."</i>

70
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,117
<i>Listen, confidence is
not something you have.</i>

71
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,451
<i>It's something you create.</i>

72
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,537
<i>And you can create it
at any moment in time.</i>

73
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>A sense of confidence is nothing</i>

74
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,707
<i>but a sense of power
within yourself...</i>

75
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,667
a <i>sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.</i>

76
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,794
Start the fucking car!

77
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,962
Dopinder!

78
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,588
Start the fucking car!

79
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,595
Shoot that
motherfucker! Shoot him!

80
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,305
Whoo! Oh, I shit my pants.

81
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,725
Actually, that may have been me.

82
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,018
Oh, mission accomplished?

83
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,186
Oh, in a George W. sort of way.

84
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,938
Fucker can't stay in
a panic room forever.

85
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,440
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

86
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,650
It has been quite
the run, Dopinder,

87
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,943
<i>and who' da thought'?</i>

88
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,070
Now I'm talked about in
the same sentence as Jesus.

89
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,406
<i>Passion of the Christ, then me.</i>

90
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,699
At least domestically.

91
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,950
We beat them overseas,

92
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,994
where there's no such
thing as religion.

93
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,246
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

94
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,623
Taxiing is not as
sexy as it looks.

95
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,500
I want to fill my... Pockets?

96
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,754
What's your poison? A
little, uh, cokey cokey?

97
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,130
Can't maintain an erection

98
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,631
without buying shoes online?

99
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,717
I've never experienced
that last one.

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,010
Talk to me, Goose.

101
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,888
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

102
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,932
I want to belong to
something, like you, Pool, sir.

103
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,601
Dopmdenn Hmm?

104
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,936
You never cease to surprise me.

105
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,066
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

106
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,776
We all need a
sense of belonging.

107
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,611
We all need a
genuine sense of home.

108
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,779
A place in this world.

109
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,155
I want to become
a contract killer.

110
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,740
I'm sorry. What did you say?

111
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,034
Remember when I kidnapped Bandhu

112
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,410
and threatened him
with great violence?

113
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,828
You kind of killed him.

114
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,663
<i>And then remember the</i> movie
<i>Interview with the Vampire?</i>

115
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,873
Don't want to.

116
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,999
When Tom Cruise fed

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,876
10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood

118
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,127
for the first time...

119
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,588
and she looked up at his smooth,

120
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,882
handsome face and said...

121
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,426
"I want some more."

122
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,138
Oh, Pool, picture me, a
10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

123
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,183
I'll never not picture that.

124
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,685
But I can't wait to
never speak of this,

125
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,145
as soon as possible.

126
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,357
We're here.

127
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,074
Dopinder, it's me again.

128
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,826
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

129
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,744
from joining the
deadly merc business...

130
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,246
what, with your concave chest

131
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,956
and your paper towel tube arms.

132
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,707
But you're an eagle...

133
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,751
and goddamn it, an
eagle's gotta soar.

134
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,169
You gotta grab those dreams,

135
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,838
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

136
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,422
and make it rain!

137
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,383
I don't know what that means.

138
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,426
Me neither.

139
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,470
I'm gonna see you...

140
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,140
at the office.

141
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,808
In the sky.

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,934
You're my Tom Cruise!

143
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,644
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

144
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,979
Kristen? Kirsten?

145
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,819
Sorry I'm late.

146
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,445
There was a bunch of

147
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,573
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

148
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,907
and I had to, uh... Uh-uh.

149
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,910
You're right. I was
fighting a caped badass.

150
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,246
But then we discovered his
mom is named Martha, too.

151
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,331
No. You got me.

152
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,500
L was rounding up all
the gluten in the world

153
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,751
and launching it into space...

154
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,837
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

155
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,172
Try again.

156
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,174
Diarrhea?

157
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,967
We can't be sure until
I get this suit off...

158
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,012
but, uh, all signs point to yes.

159
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,931
Traffic?

160
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,600
Hmm?

161
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,394
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

162
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,478
Well, come here.

163
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm gonna shower and
get out of this suit.

164
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,827
Don't you want your surprise?

165
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,746
Do I look like a
patient burn victim?

166
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,789
I got one for you, too.

167
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,292
Happy anniversary, baby.

168
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,044
Open, open, open.

169
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,380
Skee-Ball token.

170
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,174
Our first date.

171
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,508
Yup.

172
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,553
That's genuine, high-grade lead.

173
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,350
I'll keep it forever.

174
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,227
Thank you, baby.

175
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,563
Open yours. All
right, all right.

176
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,774
Oh...

177
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,985
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

178
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,403
I don't know what this is.

179
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,988
My mo.

180
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,365
A bomb?

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,243
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

182
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,786
What, you mean that your...

183
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,579
Baby factory's
open for business.

184
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,747
Oh, my God!

185
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,209
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

186
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,128
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,215
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

188
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,343
Like Cher or Todd.

189
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,845
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

190
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,930
Yes, I do.

191
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,765
Let's watch some porn and
show that bed who's boss.

192
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,849
Let's do that.

193
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,519
<i>Papa...</i>

194
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,397
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

195
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,192
<i>Papa, can you see me?</i>

196
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,778
Does this song sound
familiar to you?

197
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,532
May.

198
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,995
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

199
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,041
So weird.

200
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,544
Family was always
an F-word to me.

201
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,257
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

202
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,635
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

203
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,429
to draw off of for Todd.

204
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,224
Hey. Look at me.

205
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,561
You are not your father.

206
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,689
Besides...

207
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:39,485
l will never, ever let
our child be named Todd.

208
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,487
But here's the thing,

209
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,114
isn't that how it always works?

210
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,949
Like in Star Wars,

211
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,076
men are destined to
become their father...

212
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,830
and then have consensual
sex with their sister?

213
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,333
I think you missed big,
big chunks of that movie.

214
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,461
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

215
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,171
<i>Baby, that's Empire.</i>

216
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,257
The point is, kids...

217
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,386
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

218
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,348
Better than we used to be.

219
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,434
You're a lot
smarter than I look.

220
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,853
I'm gonna go make dessert.

221
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,315
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

222
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,943
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

223
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,573
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

224
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,575
It's too stripper-y.

225
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,160
Kevin With a "K"!

226
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,329
No, too stripper-y, too.

227
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,498
Uh, Earl!

228
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,167
He's gonna go straight to jail

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,044
if we name him Earl.

230
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,380
What about Bruce?

231
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,548
No.

232
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,883
Get down.

233
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,343
What?

234
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,998
Baby? Baby?

235
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,670
I'm okay.

236
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,840
Thank God I didn't have to
use the cream cheese spreader.

237
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,876
Please.

238
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,757
Please. Please.

239
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,886
Baby, I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,848
No!

241
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,077
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

242
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,537
ls it just me, or does

243
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,373
<i>Do You Want to Build a
Snowman? from Frozen...</i>

244
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,707
sound suspiciously like

245
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,709
<i>Papa, Can You Hear
Me? from Yentl?</i>

246
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

247
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,592
And nobody fucking realizes it.

248
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,219
Wade, you gotta go home.

249
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,888
You've been sitting
here for three days, okay?

250
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,642
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

251
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,103
Like wet garbage in hot urine.

252
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,313
You smell like a dog
ate kitty litter...

253
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,399
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

254
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,275
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

255
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,902
<i>couch cushions after Shark Week.</i>

256
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>Hove Frozen.</i>

257
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,199
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

258
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,701
An ocean is water.

259
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:06,455
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

260
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,082
George Michael was right.

261
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

262
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,585
He's dead, too.

263
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,088
At least we still have Bowie.

264
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,840
Oh, Mr. Pool. David Bowie is...

265
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,924
Uh, uh, uh...

266
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,384
still With us.

267
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,345
We do. We'll always have Bowie.

268
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,930
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,306
Shot after shot,

270
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,308
it's not gonna change the
fact that I think you're...

271
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,977
Are you pissing? Are
you urinating right now?

272
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,813
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

273
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,440
Is he pissing? I'm on it!

274
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,066
There you go, Dopinder.

275
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,152
If you want to be
a contract killer...

276
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,738
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

277
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,822
Although I don't
quite understand

278
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,115
how they are at all similar.

279
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,576
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

280
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,744
Now, leave me.

281
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,828
I get it.

282
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
Go home, Wade.

283
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,374
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

284
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,169
Okay, I'm fine.

285
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
I'm fine.

286
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,213
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

287
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,633
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

288
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,302
According to the...

289
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,804
<i>Khmer-Ross. Yeah.</i>

290
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,931
According to the
KUbler-Ross model...

291
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,768
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

292
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,811
Jesus Christ, Buck!

293
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,189
No more speaking lines for you.

294
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,158
<i>Hey, bud. Bud.</i>

295
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,035
<i>- Huh?
- Got a match?</i>

296
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,369
<i>Match?</i>

297
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,246
<i>Yes, I have one right here.</i>

298
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,706
<i>Don't make</i> a <i>move.
This is</i> a <i>stick-up.</i>

299
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,541
<i>- What?
- You heard me.</i>

300
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,627
<i>JACK". Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.</i>

301
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?</i>

302
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,141
<i>Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."</i>

303
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,309
"I'm thinking it over!"

304
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,977
Motherfuck!

305
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,145
Fuck!

306
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,566
The hell you doin' here?

307
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,068
Don't you know how to knock?

308
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,654
I thought you saw me...

309
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,072
with your ears.

310
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
You're lucky I
didn't shootyouintheu.

311
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,407
The wall?

312
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,869
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

313
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,249
I heard the news, sweetie.

314
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,084
I'm very sorry. lam.

315
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,919
What am I gonna do, Al?

316
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,129
Probably something terrible.

317
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,549
Knowing you.

318
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,259
It was my fault.

319
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,345
I fucking did this.

320
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,014
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

321
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,100
and tell her that
I'm sorry, and I can't.

322
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,687
She's gone.

323
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,190
Sweetheart, can you speak up?

324
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,817
It's a little hard to hear you

325
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,569
with that pity
dick in your mouth.

326
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,655
Now, look, sugar. You
need to just keep living.

327
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,739
Thank you...

328
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,034
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

329
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,161
Listen to the pain.

330
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,956
It's both history
teacher and fortune teller.

331
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,917
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

332
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,963
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

333
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,341
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

334
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,053
Wade?

335
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,433
Wade? I'm right here, Althea.

336
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,311
And that is the
most beautiful thing

337
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,604
I've ever heard.

338
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,898
And you're absolutely right.

339
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,112
I'm about to do
something terrible.

340
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,453
Precious, aren't they?

341
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,663
Whoa!

342
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,165
Are you a superhero?

343
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,875
Fucking A, sweetie.

344
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,501
What's your name?

345
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,337
Captain Delicious Pants.

346
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,589
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

347
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,908
I can't believe
he's still alive.

348
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,494
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

349
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,872
There's gotta be
some way to die.

350
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,958
L just need to die harder.

351
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,167
Trademark Fox.

352
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,335
Y'all caught up now?

353
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,183
<i>Open for business.</i>

354
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,855
<i>Your crazy matches my crazy.</i>

355
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,316
<i>I will never, ever let
our child be named Todd.</i>

356
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,567
<i>Skee-Ball token.</i>

357
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,735
<i>You're a lot
smarter than I look.</i>

358
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,993
<i>About why we're
so good together.</i>

359
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,411
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

360
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,498
Ness?

361
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,084
Ness?

362
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,919
Ness.

363
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,214
Ness, there's something
here. I can't get to you.

364
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,010
Your heart's not
in the right place.

365
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,345
Wait, hold on. What?

366
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,265
Your heart's not
in the right place.

367
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,391
Wait. What do you mean

368
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,726
my heart's not in the
right place? What does it...

369
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,498
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

370
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,042
You're broken.

371
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,086
Oh, God. I know that voice.

372
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,567
Well, Russell.

373
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,320
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

374
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,865
There will be no
need for that here.

375
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,243
There's no locks on our
doors, no bars on our windows.

376
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,622
I know what you're thinking.

377
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,791
Why don't the kids just run?

378
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,960
Who would choose to
stay in such a place?

379
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,421
You stay because...

380
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:34,635
deep down inside, you
know you're unfit to leave.

381
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,057
Don't worry.

382
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,893
We can fix that.

383
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,485
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

384
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,092
"Heart's in the right place."

385
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,593
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

386
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,554
Take your mask off, Wade.

387
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,222
I wish you'd said "pants".

388
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,557
Let's play a game.

389
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,101
It's called "Adrien
Brody or Adam Brody?".

390
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,520
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

391
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,438
You don't need to be funny here.

392
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,190
We must talk.

393
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,776
You need fresh start.

394
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,361
Such a glare.

395
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,613
It's like I'm on
stage at the Gaiety.

396
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,241
With training, you can be X-Man.

397
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,493
You're wasting your
time, Shiny Jesus.

398
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,828
I'm not X-Man material.

399
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,496
Understatement of the year.

400
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:45,956
Wade, Yukio.

401
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,583
Yukio, Wade.

402
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,460
What in the fuck
knuckles is this?

403
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,421
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

404
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,007
Whoa! <i>Pump the hate
brakes, Fox</i> & <i>Friends.</i>

405
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,925
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

406
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,303
<i>Especially Pinkie Pie
from My Little Pony.</i>

407
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,013
I like this guy.

408
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,848
Give him a chance.

409
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,683
It's great seeing you like this.

410
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,977
Yeah.

411
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,437
Bye, Wade!

412
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,231
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

413
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,067
"Rule number one. No killing...

414
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,571
"anyone ever, no matter how bad.

415
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,240
"Rule two. Label
everything in refrigerator."

416
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,325
Wade?

417
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,285
Wade?

418
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,245
Don't try to chase me. Wade!

419
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,414
I'm not ready to
be touched again.

420
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,708
All these old guys on the wall.

421
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,877
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

422
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,465
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

423
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,967
What am I supposed to
do around here, anyway?

424
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,261
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

425
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,931
And how would I do that exactly?

426
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,683
'Cause where the
fuck is everyone?

427
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,851
It's always just you

428
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,269
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

429
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,354
Enough!

430
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,481
I said no touching!

431
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,777
What the fuck?

432
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,696
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

433
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,823
One that doesn't
end up in my mouth.

434
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,784
The first movie made more money

435
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,161
than the guy who invented pants.

436
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,372
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

437
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,540
How 'bout that putz with
the giant pigeon wings?

438
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,875
What do those do anyway, huh?

439
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,377
Carry him three
feet off the ground

440
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,379
to snatch up the
nearest muffin crumb?

441
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,714
No,no,no!

442
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,467
lam not X-Man material at all.

443
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,178
First off...

444
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,305
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

445
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,558
I should have left you

446
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,310
in the self-pitying
mess I found you in.

447
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,438
But this is what
friends do. They show up!

448
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,190
Not when convenient or easy.

449
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,944
When hard, and you
always make it hard.

450
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,364
You are unwell.

451
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,533
I'm sticking my neck
out bringing you here.

452
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,451
Wait. One of the assholes

453
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,036
who killed Vanessa got away.

454
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,624
Oh, Jesus Christ!

455
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,668
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

456
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,628
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

457
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,714
Wade, whoever they are...

458
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,133
we track them down and
bring them to justice.

459
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,135
It was me.

460
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,556
I'm the asshole who got away.

461
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,310
I killed every last
one of them, except me.

462
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,562
Couldn't kill me.

463
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,692
We were gonna start a family.

464
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,404
We were, uh...

465
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,407
We were gonna be a family.

466
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,200
Wade...

467
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,162
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

468
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,041
This may not be
family you want...

469
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,126
but it's family you need.

470
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,836
You have a good heart.

471
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,463
It belongs here
where it can grow.

472
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,257
What did you say?

473
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,635
About my heart?

474
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,060
I think I'm in the right place.

475
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,630
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

476
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,298
Toilet paper.

477
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,758
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

478
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,009
Gets the job done.

479
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,929
Does it really get the job done?

480
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,181
All right. Say you wake
up tomorrow morning...

481
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:17,936
and, hypothetically, find
some fresh shit on your face.

482
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,688
Your cheek, maybe a
little bit in the beard.

483
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,398
What the hell? I'm
about to be fucking sick!

484
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,524
What do you do?

485
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,900
Do you go to a bathroom

486
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,610
and tear off a piece
of dry tissue...

487
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,529
and rub it around on
your beard a little bit

488
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,156
and then go on, get
on with your day?

489
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,824
Go to church, maybe
dinner and a movie,

490
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,992
like nothing happened?

491
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,410
Where is this coming from, man?

492
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,703
But something did happen.

493
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,204
Your face smells
like shit. Right?

494
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,831
So what you would do,

495
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,125
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

496
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,502
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

497
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,546
out of your beard for
10 straight minutes.

498
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,298
You could not scrub it enough.

499
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,008
Are you trying to
make me feel disgusting?

500
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,259
I'm starting to feel...

501
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,012
Toilet paper is a
plenty fine appetizer.

502
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,181
But, then...

503
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,725
Huggies Natural Care wet wipes.

504
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,143
That's your main course.

505
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,354
They're soft, they're
moist. They're for babies.

506
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,941
Finally, one more
pass with toilet paper,

507
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,902
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

508
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,570
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

509
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,946
if you can get you a hair dryer.

510
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,365
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

511
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,078
The fuck?

512
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,372
Year.

513
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,374
What?

514
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,211
What year is it?

515
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,755
What kind of dumbass
question is that to ask?

516
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,247
<i>We have 8 <i>weeks of boot
camp ahead of us, men.</i></i>

517
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,623
<i>That'll get us
toned and prepared</i>

518
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>for all manner of combat.</i>

519
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:09,381
Not working out at all.

520
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,258
Masking tape.

521
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,677
It is no friend to
chilled aluminum.

522
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,721
Velcro. Color-coded, efficient,

523
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,889
environmentally friendly.

524
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,183
Who is he talking to?

525
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,893
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

526
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,937
Can we focus for
a moment, ladies?

527
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,273
Please, we need to talk
about next month's meal plan.

528
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,108
Obviously, everyone
hated the ceviche.

529
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,484
I read the suggestion box.

530
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,152
I'm gonna stop you right there.

531
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,029
I see through this weak act.

532
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,492
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

533
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,827
but not me.

534
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,953
Don't be mean.

535
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,329
Back Off, NTW.

536
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,582
No,no,no.Lethergo.

537
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,791
Let her go, it's okay.

538
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,418
She has a right to be skeptical.

539
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,129
Look at me. I'm an easy target.

540
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,631
You know, historically,

541
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,592
mischief has been my mistress...

542
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,344
so I understand, you
know. But I like to think...

543
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,931
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

544
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,310
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

545
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,354
A lot.

546
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,983
And for the first
time in a long while...

547
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,234
I like me.

548
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,947
I accept your apology.
I never apologized.

549
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,532
I was talking to your heart.

550
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,993
See? You're not lost
cause you thought.

551
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,246
I'm proud. You're
everything I knew you can be.

552
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,623
Thank you, Colossus.

553
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,958
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

554
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,460
Sorry, X-Person.

555
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,672
Hmm. Something
wrong with the soap.

556
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,341
It's fine.

557
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,635
L just filled it. Give
it a few more pumps there.

558
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,305
Now, if you'll excuse me...

559
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,140
it's dust bunny season...

560
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,224
and I'm hunting wabbits.

561
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,060
Bye, Wade!

562
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,773
Fuck. Fuck you.

563
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,995
<i>No one is born perfect.</i>

564
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,039
But you can be.

565
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,458
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

566
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,589
You can't help yourself.

567
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,928
But you can.

568
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,264
It takes work, discipline...

569
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,933
and treatment.

570
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,685
Your abilities...

571
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,647
I know how seductive they are.

572
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,650
How powerful they make you feel.

573
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,153
But you must learn
never to use them...

574
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,823
so they will never use you.

575
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,664
Please don't cry.

576
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,083
I'm going to help.

577
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,002
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

578
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,796
How you need to feel...

579
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,466
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

580
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,263
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

581
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,945
<i>Wade.</i>

582
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,864
Wade!

583
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,533
Come in! Hey, I was just doing

584
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,160
a little bit of
light reading here...

585
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,911
We have mission.

586
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,538
Well, you guys
be safe out there.

587
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,831
I'll be praying for you.

588
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,333
No, I want you to join.

589
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,669
I'm sorry, what?

590
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,337
You heard me.

591
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,673
Trust me, that's
a terrible idea.

592
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,883
I'm really not ready.

593
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,468
You are ready. I'm not.

594
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,470
Be at the X-Jet in five.

595
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,763
I can do thirty.

596
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,765
Now. I can do now.

597
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,891
Final offer.

598
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,643
<i>Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.</i>

599
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,687
<i>Live here at a
breaking news situation</i>

600
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,398
<i>at the Essex House for
Mutant Rehabilitation.</i>

601
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,400
A mutant boy is
appearing to have

602
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,693
some sort of an incident...

603
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,445
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

604
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,906
There are two police
vehicles that are overturned.

605
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,407
There are open fires.
Fuck off! Stay back!

606
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,492
A scene of absolute chaos here.

607
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,576
Calm down.

608
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,370
I'll burn you! You stay back!

609
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,831
Get away from me!

610
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,417
You wanna fucking die?

611
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,602
And it appears as if
the X-Men are arriving...

612
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,686
Scatter!

613
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,231
...with what appears
to be a trainee.

614
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,275
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

615
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,443
We're the X-Men!

616
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,737
A dated metaphor for
racism in the '60s.

617
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,323
So, respect.

618
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,950
At ease, Officer.

619
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,078
What are you doing?

620
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,788
<i>N“! 'mm!</i>

621
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,248
You're the one who
said I was ready,

622
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,791
and I frankly
disagreed with you.

623
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,252
But here we are, trying
to overcome our differences.

624
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,754
Like Beyoncé says, "Please...

625
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,923
"Please, stop cheating on me."

626
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,091
Hey!

627
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,509
This is the fifth incident.

628
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,761
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

629
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,471
Russell belongs in our care.

630
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,306
Not in prison. I assure you...

631
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,474
we have everything
under control.

632
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,600
Stay back! I'll burn you!

633
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,852
Not getting a real

634
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,603
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

635
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,064
It is Glen, isn't it? Daniel.

636
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,357
I'll ask the questions, Miguel.

637
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,733
Let me talk to the kid.

638
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:25,655
You stay here with your
weird, secret sex lips.

639
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,408
You wanna die?

640
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,492
This kid's adorable.

641
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,660
I don't know why I
packed the hollow points.

642
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,870
I'll burn your balls off!

643
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,581
First day. I'm so nervous!

644
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,875
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

645
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,293
Yeah, probably should've

646
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,420
brought a Super Soaker.

647
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:41,963
Hi, there!

648
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,717
Stay back or Justin Bieber dies!

649
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,304
Justin Bieber. He
called you Justin Bieber.

650
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,307
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

651
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,476
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

652
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,020
Okay? Let's just talk!

653
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,354
It's Russell, right?

654
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,607
Firefist. Firefist.

655
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,276
Ooh, that's a great
name. Where does it burn?

656
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,777
Just the fist, or all
the way up to the elbow?

657
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,452
Definitely all the
way up to the elbow.

658
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,537
Come quietly, or
there will be trouble.

659
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,749
You <i>stole that from
Robocop! That's from Robocop!</i>

660
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,834
Just stand down!

661
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,961
You're embarrassing
me. Look, Fire.

662
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,673
Oh, my God! I can't
say it! I'm so sorry!

663
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,973
Oh, shit! That fucking does it!

664
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,808
Put your hands behind your knees

665
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,352
and get down on your head! Now!

666
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,646
Wade! What was first rule?

667
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,648
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

668
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,317
Do not escalate! Rules
are meant to be broken!

669
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,777
That's the exact opposite

670
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,236
of what they're meant for!

671
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,697
Fuck! Fine!

672
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,282
I'll start from the beginning.

673
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,243
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

674
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,287
Trainee! Shut it!

675
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,499
Look, I get it.

676
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,293
All right, you're scared.

677
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,878
Alone.

678
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,004
You got no family.

679
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,089
I didn't have a family, either.

680
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,882
You live in this
dump. Guess what?

681
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,676
I used to live in a
shithole just like it.

682
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,886
But you know something?

683
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,680
A wise woman once said to me...

684
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,139
"Speak up.

685
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,433
"L can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

686
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,727
Too much? I went too far.

687
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,237
That was effervescent.

688
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,239
Stay in school, kid.

689
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,116
Or don't. I didn't.

690
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,034
And I'm an X-Man.

691
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,202
Trainee.

692
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,620
Fuck it!

693
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,455
Superhero landing coming up!

694
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,669
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

695
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,587
That is so not practical.

696
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,360
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

697
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,445
Trainee!

698
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,571
Trainee!

699
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,698
Get a power
restraint on him. Now!

700
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,993
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

701
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,371
What's that do?

702
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,914
Power-dampening collar.

703
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,249
Shuts down all mutant abilities.

704
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,127
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

705
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,172
Huh. Could've used one
of those in the first act.

706
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,506
HEADMASTERI Thank you!

707
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,552
That was absolutely thrilling.

708
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,637
True heroism in action.

709
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,556
We are in your debt.

710
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,975
We can take it from here.

711
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,227
Take me to the Ice Box, please!

712
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,479
Anywhere's better than here.

713
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,772
Believe me, son,

714
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,565
you do not wanna
go to the Ice Box.

715
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,151
That place makes Hitler's
anus look like Waikiki.

716
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,111
Let's get you inside, young man.

717
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,155
No, wait, wait. Wait.

718
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,740
You guys stay there.

719
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,460
Those guys hurt you?

720
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:09,921
Who?

721
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,675
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

722
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,637
Both of 'em?

723
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,017
Oh, fuck it.

724
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,644
Four or five moments!

725
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,728
I'm sorry?

726
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,981
Four or five moments!

727
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,985
That's all it
takes to be a hero.

728
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,030
People think you
wake up a hero...

729
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,990
brush your teeth a hero...

730
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,077
ejaculate into a
soap dispenser a hero.

731
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,624
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

732
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,585
A few moments...

733
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,296
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

734
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,968
No!

735
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,847
Stand down! Hold your fire!

736
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,224
Wade, what did you
do? Colossus, no!

737
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,561
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

738
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,896
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

739
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,439
What was your first clue?

740
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,317
The hollow point through
that fuckhead's face?

741
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,944
That kid was abused!

742
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,821
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

743
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,824
You are notjudge,
jury or executioner!

744
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,827
Fuck your rules! I
fight for what's right!

745
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,495
And sometimes you
gotta fight dirty!

746
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,832
You let me down for
the last time, Wade.

747
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,212
Okay, get these guys in the pod.

748
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,464
Take them to the Ice Box.

749
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,111
Hey, baby!

750
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,406
I wonder what gang I'll be in.

751
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,866
Yeah!

752
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,285
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

753
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,538
I've always seen myself as

754
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,998
more of an East
Coast Hufflepuff.

755
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,461
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

756
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,381
This is not what the
website looked like at all.

757
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,676
I love the decor though.

758
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,678
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

759
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,013
Hard left, douchebag.

760
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,685
Please, after you.

761
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,565
Another disgusting
minority off the streets.

762
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,733
We'll sleep well tonight.

763
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,817
Let's get a bagel.

764
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,949
Nighty-night, W“ anrwving prick!

765
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,569
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

766
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,030
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

767
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,574
Not to worry, we're old friends.

768
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,826
Fuck!

769
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,577
I wanted to be a superhero.

770
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,038
Always wanted a real super suit.

771
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,665
What happened?

772
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,792
When was the last time you
saw a plus-sized superhero?

773
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,669
Never.

774
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,838
The industry discriminates.

775
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,465
Fuck superheroes.

776
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,260
The thing that pisses
me off the most...

777
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,178
I never stood up
for myself in there.

778
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,598
My whole life.

779
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,228
I've been waiting for
someone to come and save me.

780
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,608
Nobody's gonna
sacrifice anything for me.

781
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,990
I gotta start taking
care of myself.

782
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,160
I have a mission now.

783
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,747
The first thing I wanna
do when I get out of here...

784
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,124
burn the headmaster alive...

785
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,793
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

786
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,380
Aw. That's, like, my
favorite part of the Bible.

787
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,051
I don't have a
sock puppet on me...

788
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,136
but what did he do to you?

789
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,305
Did he taste the rainbow?

790
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,432
I'd whisper it, but
Skittles would sue us.

791
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,226
Fucker hates mutants.

792
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,562
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

793
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,190
Nothing worse than a "pray
the gay away" type guy.

794
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,359
Sick piece of shit.

795
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:46,447
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

796
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,075
and we'll make him our bitch!

797
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,330
What was that?

798
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,374
That is the biggest guy in here.

799
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,085
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

800
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,961
though no one's ever seen it,

801
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,214
they keep a monster
in the basement.

802
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,007
Right next to a huge,

803
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,634
steaming bowl of foreshadowing.

804
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,260
Look.

805
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,180
I can't protect you.

806
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,681
With this collar on,

807
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,851
my superpower is
just unbridled cancer.

808
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,813
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

809
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,482
Now, if you'll excuse me...

810
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,735
I've got tumors to
grow. Vanessa awaits.

811
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,071
I'll start by making us a shank.

812
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,198
Good listening. I
stole that guard's pen...

813
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,200
and stashed it in
the old prison wallet,

814
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,660
if you know what I'm saying.

815
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,204
I really hope I don't
know what you're saying.

816
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,583
I know it's in there, I
just need to get it out.

817
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,585
Oh, Jesus Christ.

818
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,088
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

819
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,632
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

820

00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,320
Don't do that.

835
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,740
What? Why are you winking at me?

836
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,745
I got your back.

837
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,996
Oh, my God.

838
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,539
You're sick, I
gotta protect you.

839
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,541
Just leave me alone, kid.

840
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,752
Oh, great.

841
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,089
Well, hello there, new fish.

842
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,092
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

843
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,470
I've done some
light catalog work...

844
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,014
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

845
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,016
L was talking to him. Oh.

846
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,937
Have we met? I can't
place your mustache.

847
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,981
Black Tom Cassidy.
White Wade Wilson.

848
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,193
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

849
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,071
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

850
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,822
You don't look like much to me.

851
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,159
First rule of the
yard, fuckface...

852
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,827
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

853
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,292
Second biggest guy.

854
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,628
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

855
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,382
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

856
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,800
Can we get a wipe
down on the table?

857
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,220
Kid, I think you
picked the wrong side.

858
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,181
No, I didn't! He's my friend!

859
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,517
Zip it. We're not friends.

860
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,311
You're about to
get dick-slapped.

861
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,940
UNMATESSHOUHNG)

862
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,576
I had so much fun!
You were like...

863
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,703
And I was like, "Take
a seat, shit dick."

864
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,912
Just let me die in peace.

865
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,331
We make a great team!

866
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,293
Oh, God! We're not a team.

867
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:31,672
Why'd you say that back
there? We're friends, partners.

868
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,174
We're not partners or friends.

869
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,636
This doesn't end with
us riding into the sunset.

870
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,888
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

871
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,517
and you winning the Ice
Box award for softest mouth.

872
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,812
There's only one
person in this world

873
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,689
that I care about,
and she's gone.

874
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,484
You wanna survive?

875
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,989
Stop trying to shank the
biggest guys in here...

876
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,949
and make friends with them.

877
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,827
Make friends with someone.

878
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,663
Anyone but me.

879
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,167
Maybe even Black Tim.

880
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,628
Black Evan, I don't know.

881
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,213
All I remember is he
was African-American.

882
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,719
<i>System malfunctioning.</i>

That was our cell.

891
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,533
What did I do to piss
off a grumpy old fucker

892
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,784
with a Winter Soldier arm?

893
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,962
Get away from me, kid!

894
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,804
Listen to me! Go!

895
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,603
Hello, Russell.

896
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,063
I don't bargain.

897
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,207
Who are you?

898
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,334
I'm Batman.

899
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,805
Ooh!

900
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,438
Oh. That's got some zip.

901
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,741
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

902
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,492
Talk!

903
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,786
What kind of
spineless shit stick

904
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,246
tries to kill a 14-year-old boy?

905
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,707
You might wanna start talking!

906
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,209
'Cause I got a long history
of firing at times like this!

907
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,212
The name's Cable.

908
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,424
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

909
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,384
Oh!

910
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,928
So, you're from the future.

911
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,305
I have three questions then.

912
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,642
One, is dubstep still a thing?

913
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,561
Two, do people still homebrew?

914
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:22,230
And three, does
Dopinder ever find love?

915
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,110
Dubstep's for pussies.

916
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,361
You're so dark!

917
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,655
Are you sure you're
not from the DC universe?

918
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,907
I love dubstep!

919
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,643
ls that a fanny pack?

920
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,312
I used to have one
of those in 1990-never.

921
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,357
Something to remember you by.

922
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:51,153
Give me that back! That
goes with me everywhere.

923
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,613
Like the memory of
your fucking fanny pack!

924
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,417
Why are you protecting the kid?

925
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,670
I don't give a fuck about him...

926
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,506
<i>and his Are You
My Mother? complex!</i>

927
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,093
What's this one do?

928
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,859
<i>In every film, there's</i> a <i>moment</i>

929
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,278
<i>when the hero hits rock bottom.</i>

930
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,280
<i>In Cool Runnings, it
was when John Candy's</i>

931
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,656
<i>prized bobsled broke.</i>

932
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,077
In Human Centipede, <i>it</i>
was when those people...

933
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,703
<i>signed on to be in that movie.</i>

934
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,246
<i>But in this film, well...</i>

935
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,123
<i>you're looking at it.</i>

936
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,958
On your fucking knees, mutant.

937
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:50,879
<i>Rock...</i>

<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

940
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,481
Ness?

941
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,983
Hey,Ness!

942
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,653
Ness, can you let me in?

943
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,822
Please! Please.

944
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,075
Jesus.

945
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,746
You're not giving me a
lot of direction here.

946
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,623
I'm at the end of my rope.

947
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,378
Then I joined the X-Men.

948
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,380
I went to prison. I, uh...

949
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,969
ls it the kid?

950
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,932
Kids give us a chance to
be better than we used to be.

951
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,351
The kid!

952
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,700
That's exactly what she meant.

953
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:02,951
Your heart needs to
be in the right place.

954
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,911
I'm not gonna abandon this kid.

955
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,581
He's never had anyone, ever.

956
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,957
I need to be selfless.

957
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,959
Yeah, but what does that mean?

958
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,171
It means I'm gonna save Russell.

959
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,839
Maybe I couldn't save Vanessa...

960
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,884
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

961
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,969
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

962
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,470
I literally don't
know what that means.

963
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,763
Jesus Christ.

964
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,558
Okay, look. According
to my guy, okay...

965
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,393
those muties are
being transferred

966
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,270

967
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,147
Great, I'll pick 'em
off along the way.

968
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,357
Hold your testicles
there, buddy,okay?

969
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,401
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

970
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,070
and a vicious super
soldier from the future...

971
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,489
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

972
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:42,991
You know what we need to do?

973
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,826
We need to build a fucking team.

974
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,037
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

975
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,496
and young enough
so they can carry

976
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,706
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

977
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,625
A team of highly-skilled
motherfuckers.

978
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,711
I'm talking about some
<i>Ocean's</i> 14 shit. <i>Rogue Two.</i>

979
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,172
John Wick <i>3,</i> but with
the original director.

980
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,132
My body is an
instrument of death.

981
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,550
Not now, Dopinder.

982
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,052
I could be of great use.

983
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,720
What's your superpower?

984
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,140
Courage. That's adorable.

985
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,850
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

986
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,269
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

987
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,354
Yes, sir.

988
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,688
I'm sorry you had to see that,

989
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,273
although I'm glad you heard it.

990
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,026
All right, I'll put
out a call for resumes.

991
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,320
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

992
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,447
It's time to get
back on Linkedln.

993
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,860
<i>Attention, all inmates!</i>

994
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,405
<i>Transport to Cross
Force Maximum Security</i>

995
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,864
<i>Mutant Containment Facility...</i>

996
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,866
<i>will begin at 0800 hours.</i>

997
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,994
<i>Inspection of your
cells and out processing</i>

998
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,121
<i>will begin at 0600.</i>

999
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,422
Oi.

1000
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,881
What the fuck do you want?

1001
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,758
That's my fucking pudding.

1002
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,135
Fuck your pudding!
You like pudding?

1003
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:47,866
Hello?

1004
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,495
I know you're in there.

1005
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,472
Must be hard being
the biggest guy in here.

1006
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,017
Lonely at the top, eh?

1007
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,061
They're moving us tomorrow.

1008
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,315
Maybe I can get you out of here.

1009
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,694
And we can make the
whole world our bitch.

1010
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,281
We need a secret code.

1011
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,953
No, that's stupid,
Russell. Idiot.

1012
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,712
We're a team.

1013
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,714
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

1014
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,758
I'm like Tupac, and
you're like Ice Cube.

1015
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,511
Supposedly, she can rap, too.

1016
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,678
DEADPOOLI Yeah.

1017
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:51,763
I like that.

1018
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,264
Terrific, these
are all terrific.

1019
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,225
Meet Bedlam.

1020
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,477
Cool name! Superpowers?

1021
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,104
I can distort electrical fields.

1022
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,524
Including the one
inside your brain...

1023
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,276
causing anxiety, confusion...

1024
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,444
Dam

1025
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,447
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

1026
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,698
We can use him.

1027
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,993
I'm Zeitgeist.

1028
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,412
Cool. I like it.

1029
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,746
So you have the power

1030
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,165
to put your finger on
the pulse of society?

1031
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,334
No.

1032
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,961
No, I spit acidic vomit.

1033
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,129
Oh. Do you want me

1034
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,547
- to demonstrate?
- No!

1035
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,965
We'll take your word for it.

1036
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,508
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,
we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

1037
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,970
And this is the Vanisher.

1038
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,307
But...

1039
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,935
Vanisher!

1040
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,148
Nice! Right?

1041
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,525
He's not here, is he?

1042
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,152
He may be running late.

1043
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,197
My name's Rusty, but
I go by Shatterstar.

1044
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,824
That's good, yeah.

1045
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,993
"Rusty" is terrible. Toughie.

1046
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,787
So, uh, where are you
from? The planet Mojo World.

1047
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,956
So you're an alien,
I guess. Bad name.

1048
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,666
How does that, uh, help us?

1049
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,544
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

1050
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,379
Just once, I'm gonna
find a planet of people

1051
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,006
that are worse than
me at everything.

1052
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,258
A whole bunch of
functional idiots.

1053
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,218
I'm gonna go there, and
I'm gonna be their Superman.

1054
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,386
Isn't that Canada?

1055
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,889
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

1056
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,516
Meet... Domino.

1057
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,310
What's your shtick? I'm lucky.

1058
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,686
That's not a superpower.

1059
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,146
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

1060
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,522
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1061
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,607
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

1062
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,691
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1063
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,775
Yeah, it is. Really isn't.

1064
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:28,943
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

1065
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,111
Told you.

1066
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,529
Get out of my head!

1067
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,281
I'm not in your head.

1068
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,574
I'm in an 11-year-old's bedroom.

1069
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,867
Well, if you're so lucky,

1070
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,494
then what are you
doing here with us?

1071
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,661
I don't know yet.

1072
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,746
What's that supposed to mean?

1073
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,539
There's a reason why I'm
here, and I'll know when I know.

1074
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,374
Everything usually just
kind of works out for me.

1075
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,293
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

1076
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,670
I don't know who that is.

1077
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,922
You're hired.

1078
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,298
Lucky me.

1079
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,591
DEADPOOLI I like her!

1080
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,010
And last, but not least...

1081
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,220
Peter.

1082
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,556
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

1083
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,059
Any powers you
wanna tell us about?

1084
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,227
PETER; No.

1085
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,437
I don't have one.

1086
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,813
Um, I just saw the ad.

1087
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,607
No superpowers at all?

1088
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,818
Uh, I have both Type
1 and 2 Diabetes.

1089
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,612
OW! Oh!

1090
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,821
That's all the diabetes.

1091
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,156
Right? Yeah, you got 'em all.

1092
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,158
If you find a Type
3, let us know.

1093
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,660
Yeah.

1094
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:19,827
You're in.

1095
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,412
Yeah. Fuck!

1096
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,208
It's fulfilling work.

1097
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,589
Let's go!

1098
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,772
<i>GUARD". This is Convoy
17 departing the Ice Box.</i>

1099
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,232
<i>We are en route.</i>

1100
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,200
Peacetime makes people soft.

1101
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,579
I was born into war.

1102
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,290
Bred into it.

1103
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,417
Okay.

1104
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,587
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1105
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:13,756
These restraints are pretty...

1106
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,258
People think they
understand pain.

1107
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,176
They have no concept of it

1108
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,220
beyond their own
worst experience.

1109
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,975
5 years old. That's what?

1110
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,560
A bee sting.

1111
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,728
Oh, yeah.

1112
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,314
20 years old, shrapnel.

1113
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,691
40 years old, disease.

1114
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,654
Maybe the kind that leaves
you more machine than man.

1115
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,114
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

1116
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,782
That's what my Grandma
Ginny used to...

1117
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,075
I've got a list.

1118
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,786
We're gonna work down it.

1119
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,496
Together.

1120
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,791
Number one, I'm
gonna bend something.

1121
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,045
Something that was
not meant to bend.

1122
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,171
I'm gonna stop you right there

1123
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,547
because I'm not
gonna make it to two.

1124
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,923
I won't even make it to one.

1125
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,675
I don't do well
with pain, you know.

1126
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,886
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1127
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,180
<i>I cried when they
canceled Felicity.</i>

1128
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,390
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

1129
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,808
I have one right now.

1130
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,435
Don't look. It'll
only make it worse.

1131
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,561
I don't want you to hurt me,

1132
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,897
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1133
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,483
Except for where they are.

1134
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,276
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

1135
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,569
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1136
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,071
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

1137
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,572
You all know the plan.

1138
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,366
Intercept the convoy,

1139
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,409
grab the boy. But
not inappropriately!

1140
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:24,494
<i>You know what,</i>

1141
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:25,662
<i>I wouldn't fuck
with Deadpool either.</i>

1142
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,539
<i>Because he's built a
team. He's unstoppable.</i>

1143
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,292
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1144
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,961
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1145
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:37,173
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1146
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,009
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

1147
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,261
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

1148
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,847
there's a wind
advisory in effect.

1149
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,777
<i>A little turbulent up here.</i>

1150
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,953
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

1151
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,371
but I guarantee he hasn't killed

1152
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,206
as many people as melanoma has.

1153
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,667
We're getting close!

1154
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,669
As a former X-Man...

1155
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,629
Trainee. Thank you, Bedlam.

1156
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,048
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

1157
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,675
in the group's name.

1158
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,760
X-Men! Men!

1159
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,805
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

1160
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,181
Gender neutral.

1161
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,559
From now on, we'll
be known as...

1162
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,146
X-Force.

1163
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,939
Isn't that a little derivative?

1164
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,442
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

1165
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,153
That wasn't me.

1166
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,495
Hang the laundry
out at 1,300 feet...

1167
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,372
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

1168
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,498
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

1169
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,417
Get me on the
ground, watch me go!

1170
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,501
Yeah!

1171
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,336
I can't wait to kill!

1172
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,088
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1173
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,008
L just wanna say how
proud I am of this team.

1174
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,762
You know, you guys look amazing!

1175
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,681
Vanisher, I have no
doubt you look amazing too.

1176
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,807
This is the family

1177
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,350
that I've always
dreamed of having and I...

1178
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,436
Ah, Shit.

1179
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,731
I just get a little
choked up sometimes.

1180
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,608
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

1181
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,026
about the high winds?

1182
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,402
Gary. My name's Peter.

1183
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,362
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

1184
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,864
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

1185
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,408
Did he just call himself
God? I think he did.

1186
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,035
I'd like to go
home. And I'd like...

1187
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,579
the McRib to be
available year round,

1188
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,456
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

1189
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,666
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

1190
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,834
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

1191
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,294
because of a light breeze?

1192
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,172
You're in this
shit now, Mustache!

1193
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,174
I'm only yelling to
impress the other guys.

1194
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,176
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

1195
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,762
Leonard, hit it!

1196
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,564
Go!Go!Go!

1197
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,643
Let's get some!

1198
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:36,853
Whoo!

1199
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,062
Oh, yeah!

1200
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,982
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

1201
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,484
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

1202
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:44,819
Whoa!

1203
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,993
Little off course here.

1204
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,998
Holy mommy fucking shit!

1205
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,166
Ah, there they are.

1206
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,336
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

1207
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,797
Oh, yeah! That's right, Bedlam!

1208
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,806
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

1209
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,310
Shatterstar. Okay, you got this.

1210
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,061
Left!

1211
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,479
Left!

1212
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,773
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

1213
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,067
No, stage left, you idiot!

1214
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,489
Well,I guess we found something

1215
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,657
you're not better at.

1216
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,161
Vanisher.

1217
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,996
Maybe the wind can't
blow what it can't see.

1218
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,542
on! Really?

1219
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,419
All right, we could
do this with four.

1220
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,964
Sugarbear. You got this, buddy!

1221
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,175
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

1222
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,428
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

1223
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,013
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

1224
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,264
We did it!

1225
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,849
You're a goddamn superhero, you!

1226
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,017
X-Force!

1227
01:13:58,643 --> 01:13:59,727
X-Force.

1228
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,983
Oh!

1229
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:10,696
Peter.

1230
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,781
I got you, buddy!

1231
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:12,907
You're gonna be fine!
This is not good, man!

1232
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,618
You got this, big
guy! Here we go, Peter!

1233
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,119
Look at me. We're
X-Force, right?

1234
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,330
Yeah, we're X-Force.
We're X-Force.

1235
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,378
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

1236
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,421
Fucking acidic vomit!

1237
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,759
Oh, God! I'm gonna
throw up in my mask.

1238
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,264
Okay, I'm over the convoy.

1239
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,183
Where did the rest
of the team land?

1240
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,435
Good news and bad news.

1241
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,605
Bad news is the
whole team is dead.

1242
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,773
The good news is,

1243
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,817
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

1244
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,195
He was a bit of a
prick. Oh, but Paul!

1245
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,279
<i>Peter!</i>

1246
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,781
Peter, I'm gonna miss him most.

1247
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:54,949
But there is a slight chance

1248
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,367
Vanisher could make it.

1249
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,995
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

1250
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,246
<i>The whole team?</i>

1251
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,123
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

1252
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,457
<i>Fuck, you are dumb.</i>

1253
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,126
Whoever planned this stunt's

1254
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,378
been smoking a lotjazz cabbage.

1255
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,546
I'll tell you that much.

1256
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,256
<i>That's pretty obvious!</i>

1257
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,049
Looking good, Vanisher.

1258
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,769
They're headed into the tunnel.

1259
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,188
I'm that kid's only hope,

1260
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,149
so sit tight and
wait for my word.

1261
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:29,900
Whatever.

1262
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,152
<i>We're gonna lose
'em. I'm dropping in.</i>

1263
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:34,155
<i>Uh, that's a negative,
sole survivor.</i>

1264
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,741
<i>Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!</i>

1265
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,869
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

1266
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,624
<i>Seriously, I don't get it!</i>

1267
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,169
<i>What, you shoot luck
lasers out of your eyes?</i>

1268
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,131
<i>It's just it's hard to picture.</i>

1269
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,341
<i>And certainly not
very cinematic.</i>

1270
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,596
<i>I mean, luck?</i>

1271
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,182
<i>What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking</i>

1272
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,600
<i>freakshow comic book artist...</i>

1273
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,268
<i>came up with that
little chestnut?</i>

1274
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,645
<i>Probably a guy who
can't draw feet!</i>

1275
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,993
<i>Once again, it all
falls on my shoulders.</i>

1276
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,244
<i>It's why I'm cursed
to be a solo act.</i>

1277
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,329
<i>Wander the Earth... I'm in.</i>

1278
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,872
<i>I'm sorry, what did you say?</i>

1279
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,040
<i>I'm in.</i>

1280
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,000
How in the fuck
are you in already?

1281
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:29,710
Oh, shit.

1282
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:31,504
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

1283
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,630
Okay.

1284
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,132
New plan. Use all of
your imaginary powers

1285
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,927
to stop Cable from
killing that kid.

1286
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,637
I'm coming up on your six.

1287
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,897
That gun is amazing!

1288
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:00,991
Hey! Asshole!

1289
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,743
<i>Where is he? I can't see him.</i>

1290
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,328
<i>He's on top of you.</i>

1291
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,080
<i>He's tearing you open!</i>

1292
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:07,957
<i>He's going in through the back!</i>

1293
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,583
<i>Oh, God, he's inside!</i>

1294
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,918
You hear yourself, right?

1295
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,419
<i>Accidental double en ten dres!</i>

1296
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,964
Russell! Russell Collins!

1297
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,966
Hands off that kid, John Connor!

1298
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:22,972
No,no,no!

1299
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,435
Shit!

1300
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,293
Two can play that game!

1301
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,255
Got it! No, I don't.

1302
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,257
<i>Showtime, mama!</i>

1303
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,967
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

1304
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,465
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

1305
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,675
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

1306
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,276
Hang in there, Doms!

1307
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,238
Oh, this is really hard.

1308
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,918
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

1309
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,006
You're doing great. X-Force.

1310
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,969
I guess dubstep never dies.

1311
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,307
Whoo!

1312
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,984
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

1313
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,904
That's unfortunate.

1314
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,284
We got no brakes!

1315
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,702
Figure it out!

1316
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,624
There's nothing I can't kill.

1317
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,921
Well, as Scoutmaster
Kevin used to say...

1318
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,340
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

1319
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,635
Give me your best
shot, One-Eyed Willy.

1320
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,402
Those bullets were,
like, super fast.

1321
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:24,987
Here we go.

1322
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,282
Domino, mind slowing us down?

1323
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,451
Here goes nothing.

1324
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,400
Knock, knock.

1325
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:10,949
That's my boy.

1326
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:18,540
Holy...

1327
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,427
<i>I'll be first to admit...</i>

1328
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,888
<i>this did not go
according to plan.</i>

1329
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,766
<i>I'll also be the
first to admit that</i>

1330
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,684
<i>that plan was written in crayon.</i>

1331
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:40,979
<i>Looks like Russell
found a new friend. Jelly.</i>

1332
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,606
<i>Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,</i>

1333
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,567
<i>and maybe, possibly
mildly lucky.</i>

1334
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,904
<i>But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.</i>

1335
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,155
A mood that is

1336
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,032
about to get
significantly worse.

1337
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,225
Something is so
terribly, terribly wrong.

1338
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,646
Oh.

1339
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,066
Oh, God, that hurt.

1340
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,776
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

1341
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,406
Russell.

1342
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:36,201
Russell!

1343
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,912
Russ, where are ya?

1344
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,626
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

1345
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,963
Oh, thank God. Oh, my God!

1346
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:49,465
Juggernaut!

1347
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,801
I thought that was you!

1348
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,970
I should've worn my white pants.

1349
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:58,724
You probably get this a
lot, but I am a huge fan.

1350
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,895
<i>Uncanny X-Men 183. Thor 4M.</i>

1351
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,271
<i>X-Men Unlimited 12.</i>

1352
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,440
You know, it has always
been a dream of mine...

1353
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,275
to see my face reflected
in your helmet...

1354
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,527
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

1355
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,112
I don't mean right now.

1356
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,323
I'm gonna rip you in half now.

1357
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,742
That is such a
Juggernaut thing to say.

1358
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,833
Oh, my God! I
can't feel my legs.

1359
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,001
I can't feel...

1360
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,462
Oh, no, they're right here.

1361
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,048
Got 'em. God, Russell.

1362
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,966
I have a mission.

1363
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,635
To get my revenge.

1364
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,387
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

1365
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,640
You're not the revenge type.

1366
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:40,891
Take it from a friend.

1367
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:45,020
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

1368
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,314
You said it yourself.

1369
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:50,067
"L'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

1370
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,360
So I did.

1371
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,155
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

1372
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,784
But I can now. What do
you want me to say, huh?

1373
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,203
"L care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

1374
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,121
I care about you, Russell.

1375
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,832
What's Juggernaut
got that I don't have?

1376
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:09,086
Don't you say legs! I
know you're gonna say legs!

1377
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,422
Legs! Still hurts
to hear out loud!

1378
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,511
What is that? That's
not a real rope!

1379
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,930
You get back here, young man!

1380
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,015
Doms!

1381
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,560
Doms, get me out
of here, please.

1382
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,062
Use my arms as backpack straps.

1383
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,857
I think we may have found

1384
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,734
your cosmic reason
for being here.

1385
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,903
I'm pretty sure this isn't it.

1386
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,238
X-Force.

1387
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,545
<i>No child is hopeless.</i>

1388
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,423
Don't give up on the boy.
How could he just walk away?

1389
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,426
It was the coldness in his eyes.

1390
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,469
You should've heard it.

1391
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,682
I guess family
really is an F-word.

1392
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,768
Rub my legs, Mama.

1393
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,228
Why would I rub your legs?

1394
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,897
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

1395
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,569
What in the...

1396
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,322
Why is your hand so tiny again?

1397
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,198
That's not my hand.

1398
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,534
Oh! Mary, mother of Joseph!

1399
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,995
That was nice for me.

1400
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,831
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

1401
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,171
Why wouldn't you cover that up?

1402
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,840
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

1403
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,842
Yeah, but you do. Look at you.

1404
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,927
You're just straight
shirt-cocking it,

1405
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,429
toddler-style.

1406
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:44,431
Oh, yeah. Full Winnie the Pooh.

1407
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,475
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

1408
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,768
I wouldn't ask him to
do that, if I were you.

1409
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,436
It's like, um... Here we go.

1410
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,729
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

1411
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,314
but they quit halfway through.

1412
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,482
They got the legs
out, and they said,

1413
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,900
"You know what, I'm done."

1414
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:55,984
Happy?

1415
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,110
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

1416
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,528
But this time, you can see

1417
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:00,030
the Muppet's dick.

1418
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,239
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

1419
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,616
Mr. Weasel, I can no
longer be double-parked.

1420
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,368
I've had three tickets already.

1421
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,455
No, no, no, DP, not again!

1422
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,332
This has happened before?

1423
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,876
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

1424
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,252
The indecision is killing me.

1425
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,213
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

1426
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:19,966
Oh. WOW!

1427
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,677
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

1428
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,345
I'm talking about your face.

1429
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:25,639
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

1430
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,891
Jesus Christ! Looks
like an avocado.

1431
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,601
Your legs, though, they're cute.

1432
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,728
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

1433
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,856
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

1434
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,234
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

1435
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,277
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1436
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,655
"The Time Traveler's
Wife's" husband“.

1437
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:42,906
Beat me within an
inch of my life.

1438
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,241
He was torturing me!

1439
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,244
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1440
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,496
So, I'm here to help us gear up.

1441
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,123
So we can go after
him without me.

1442
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,207
WADE; No!

1443
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:53,959
I'm doing this alone.

1444
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,127
The Juggernaut

1445
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,378
will kill you all. Fair enough.

1446
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,505
I just need a couple
of hours to get some legs

1447
01:26:58,588 --> 01:26:59,673
under me. What will you do?

1448
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,049
I don't care what
the kid did to me.

1449
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,426
I ain't letting
Cable get to him,

1450
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:03,802
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1451
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,887
It's reallyjust a sip
of tea at this point.

1452
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,723
Zip it, black Black
Widow! I'm flowing.

1453
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:08,807
The first order of business is

1454
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:09,975
to get me in front of Cable...

1455
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,685
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1456
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:14,104
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1457
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,939
Then, I'm gonna take his skin...

1458
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:19,109
and stretch it out over
a homemade mating drum.

1459
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,279
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

1460
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,706
What in the ass?

1461
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,084
Is this apartment
listed on Tinder? Grindr?

1462
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,920
You picked the wrong
shithole to fuck, future boy.

1463
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:42,007
Ugh. ls that really necessary?

1464
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,928
No. It's his "Basic: Instinct."

1465
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,138
What can we help you with?

1466
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,515
I'm here to proposition you.

1467
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,101
on, boy!

1468
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,186
He's really teeing
it up, isn't he?

1469
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,354
Who gets to make the first joke?

1470
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,731
I think we should all
do it at the same time.

1471
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:58,815
Good call.

1472
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,442
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

1473
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,693
I only do over the
pants, mouth stuff.

1474
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:02,861
Fuck!

1475
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:03,987
<i>The Proposition has</i> a <i>wonderful</i>

1476
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,071
Guy Pearce performance.

1477
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,907
Wait, wait, wait! I
wanna do mine over.

1478
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,326
Give us the line
again. I need your help!

1479
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:12,162
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

1480
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,873
but you unleashed the
Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1481
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,667
I can't bring him down alone.

1482
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,377
So here we are.

1483
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,464
We're no longer
accepting applications

1484
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,924
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1485
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,425
Even if we were...

1486
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,135
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

1487
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,386
We don't have a lot of time.

1488
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,222
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1489
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,765
No offense, but if
you know so much...

1490
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,184
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1491
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:35,769
Or better yet, head
back a little further,

1492
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:36,853
kill baby Hitler.

1493
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,897
I use a device to
slide through time.

1494
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,608
The longer I travel, the
harder it is to control.

1495
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:44,277
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

1496
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,487
one to get me home.

1497
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,696
Well.

1498
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,657
That's just lazy writing.

1499
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,950
Your boy's gonna
kill the headmaster

1500
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,576
of the orphanage tonight.

1501
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,745
After that, he gets
a real taste for it.

1502
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,540
Like 10-year-old Kirsten
Dunst, motherfucker!

1503
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,583
So he keeps killing...

1504
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,126
and killing, and killing,

1505
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,419
and killing.

1506
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,965
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

1507
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:08,927
My People.

1508
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:13,974
Relax.

1509
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,518
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

1510
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,145
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1511
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,773
and you know it, you
sick son of a bitch!

1512
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,525
The difference is night and day.

1513
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,487
You remind me of my wife.

1514
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:28,780
I'm sorry.

1515
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,240
I said, "You remind
me of my wife."

1516
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,616
No, I'm sorry that
you said that...

1517
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,452
while making heavy eye
contact and applying lip balm.

1518
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,704
She always struggled.

1519
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,248
But she was funny...

1520
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,834
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

1521
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,920
Something I could never master.

1522
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,048
It was my fault she died.

1523
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:51,344
It was my job to
stop people like him.

1524
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,347
<i>I came close</i> a <i>few times.</i>

1525
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,228
<i>He wasn't too happy about that.</i>

1526
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,064
<i>He was trying to hurt me...</i>

1527
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,108
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

1528
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:10,822
Blessed are the wicked

1529
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,490
who are healed by my hand.

1530
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,037
<i>He came into my home...</i>

1531
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:20,874
<i>and took the only thing
that made it a home.</i>

1532
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,463
Sound familiar?

1533
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,090
I'm sorry. Uh-huh.

1534
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,842
No, I'm really sorry.

1535
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,180
But that isn't Russell.

1536
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,098
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

1537
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,184
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1538
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,769
maybe a small
learning disability...

1539
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,228
splash of diabetes...

1540
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,605
but nothing that can't be fixed.

1541
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,315
If you could go back...

1542
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,068
and stop the people that
took your girl, would you?

1543
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,569
No.

1544
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:51,363
I'd buy them all a
bouquet of hand jobs.

1545
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,198
Of course I fucking would!

1546
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,033
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1547
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,118
I'm not asking
you to kill a kid!

1548
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:58,745
I'll kill the kid.

1549
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,290
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

1550
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,668
Russell's gonna burn
down that orphanage.

1551
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,753
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

1552
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,089
would want you to do the
right thing, wouldn't she?

1553
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,676
So, what's it
gonna be, handsome?

1554
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,011
Give me a chance to save him.

1555
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:16,513
What? You said...

1556
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,181
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

1557
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:20,600
If we can get to him
before that happens...

1558
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,310
promise you'll give me a chance

1559
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,187
to put him on a different path.

1560
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,438
Define "chance."

1561
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:26,690
I don't know. How
long does it take

1562
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:28,066
to save someone's
soul? That's not...

1563
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,401
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1564
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,486
What? No! Best I can do.

1565
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:32,862
Take it or leave it.

1566
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,749
WEASELI He's doing it!

1567
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,376
Look at the little
fella. He's doing it.

1568
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,336
There he goes.

1569
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,921
Jesus Christ!

1570
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,464
Just shirt-cocking it.

1571
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:52,549
Ugh.

1572
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,843
There you go, little fella.

1573
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,928
Go on, you're doing it!

1574
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,181
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

1575
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:03,476
DOMINOI Christ!

1576
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,186
That's disturbing.

1577
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,688
30 seconds.

1578
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,570
Deal. Deal.

1579
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:23,038
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

1580
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,081
I really wanted
to match, you know?

1581
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:27,167
Being a menacing team.

1582
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,376
Oh, man, it sucks.

1583
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,045
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

1584
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:34,257
And that is just
the first five steps

1585
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,051
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

1586
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,386
Where the hell are we going?

1587
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,721
You said it yourself.

1588
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,724
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

1589
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,560
I will bathe in the
blood of your enemies.

1590
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:51,524
Can you turn off the music?

1591
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:54,527
You'll do no such thing.

1592
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,529
Why don't you just say
it in an Indian accent?

1593
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,323
I'm sorry? Ap0l0gy accepted.

1594
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,450
This is a side of
you I do not like.

1595
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:01,534
Let me guess,

1596
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,161
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

1597
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:04,579
What the hell are you...?

1598
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,581
Once again, intolerance
rears its ugly head.

1599
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:07,916
I am so sorry. It gets better.

1600
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,542
I'm not a fucking racist, moron!

1601
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:11,503
That's precisely what
a racist would say.

1602
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,338
I'm with the old
white guy on this one.

1603
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,631
And that's a twist.

1604
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:15,840
When this is over...

1605
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,093
I'm going to fuck you to
death with your own broken feet.

1606
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,303
And a sexual predator,
too. That's rich.

1607
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:21,763
I should have finished college.

1608
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,931
So what exactly do you

1609
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,015
do in the future, anyway, huh?

1610
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,308
Some kind of soldier?

1611
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,185
Yeah, something like that.

1612
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:29,437
I was a soldier. Special Forces.

1613
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,148
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

1614
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,192
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

1615
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,653
Your entire generation
fucked this planet into a coma.

1616
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,279
Boom!

1617
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:39,614
Spoiler alert.

1618
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,075
Planets.

1619
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,785
Next time, Uber.

1620
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:45,161
Here's a spoiler alert.

1621
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,123
You're not a fucking hero.

1622
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:52,043
You're just an annoying
clown dressed up as a sex toy.

1623
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:53,586
Well, I got news for you.

1624
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:54,963
My heart is in the right place.

1625
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,548
Russell's not gonna kill anyone.

1626
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,550
Because of me, he's gonna
know what real love looks like.

1627
01:33:58,633 --> 01:33:59,676
We're all going to die.

1628
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:00,969
Because of you, I'll always know

1629
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,929
what a grown man with
baby balls looks like.

1630
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,348
I'm a grower, not a shower.

1631
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:06,641
God, I wish this were a bus

1632
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:07,851
where I could pull
the string and get out.

1633
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,561
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

1634
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:10,645
or you'd be in the back.

1635
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,647
- lam in the back.
- Right here!

1636
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:33,042
I made mistakes!

1637
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,044
I wanna take them back!

1638
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:38,089
You trusted me. I
took that trust...

1639
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,632
and turned it into a glory hole

1640
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,217
in an airport bathroom.

1641
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:44,053
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

1642
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,182
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

1643
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:48,766
I was once an X-Man.

1644
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,893
Trainee!

1645
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,066
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

1646
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,735
They do stick better thantape.

1647
01:34:58,818 --> 01:34:59,819
Hi, Wade!

1648
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:00,904
Please don't.

1649
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:03,740
Say whatever it is you're
here to say. Make it quick.

1650
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:04,824
Right. Quick.

1651
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,784
It's the kid. Just
like you, I let him down.

1652
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:07,869
And just like me,

1653
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,162
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

1654
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:10,496
because the whole
world wrote him off

1655
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,956
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

1656
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,708
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

1657
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,959
The Juggernaut!

1658
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:17,045
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

1659
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,297
And hi, Yukio! That was
really nice of you to say hi...

1660
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,715
so I'm saying hi back.

1661
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,133
You guys make a
super cute couple.

1662
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,885
Yeah. Where was I?

1663
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,803
Oh, yeah. You should
never meet your heroes...

1664
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,555
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

1665
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,390
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

1666
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:30,683
and causes nothing but problems!

1667
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,770
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

1668
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:37,023
Do you know what would
happen to me if I helped you?

1669
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,150
I would be disgraced.

1670
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,236
You are a criminal, a fugitive.

1671
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,820
But worst of all...

1672
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,656
you broke my heart, Wade.

1673
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:47,367
Then you know what?

1674
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,952
Your heart's in the
wrong place, big guy.

1675
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,914
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

1676
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:56,334
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

1677
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,504
So stay here in
Chéteau de Virgin...

1678
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,714
while we go get our fuck on!

1679
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:06,261
You're doing great.

1680
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,393
So you wear that helmet because

1681
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,186
your brother tries
to read your mind?

1682
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,481
Yeah, but he's in a
wheelchair, so even-steven.

1683
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:21,025
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

1684
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,027
And he's not alone.

1685
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:24,779
Secure the children.

1686
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,575
They will not replace us.

1687
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:32,287
What do you say we
go fuck some shit up?

1688
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,666
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

1689
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,463
Watch my back. I've
got the old man.

1690
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:44,215
Amen, brother.

1691
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,265
Time to make the chimichangas.

1692
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:54,058
30 seconds.

1693
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:56,811
I finally know why I'm here.

1694
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,147
I was raised in this place.

1695
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,441
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

1696
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:04,360
Wow! It's your cosmic
reason for being here.

1697
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:05,737
Shall we? This is gonna be fun.

1698
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,863
DEADPOOLI Yeah!

1699
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,281
Hey! Been meaning to ask you...

1700
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:11,617
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

1701
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,370
It's not dirt. It's the
blood of my dead daughter.

1702
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,290
<i>Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.</i>

1703
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,042
Give me some.

1704
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,626
They say laughter
heals anything...

1705
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:21,836
except, of course, that.

1706
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,129
We should just cue the music.

1707
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,990
Welcome home,
Russell. We missed you.

1708
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,201
Russell!

1709
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,703
You don't need to
do this! Let's talk!

1710
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:57,997
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

1711
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,378
That's why!

1712
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:04,504
Told you this little
fucker's too far gone.

1713
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:06,714
Zip it, Thanos! We have
a deal and you fuck...

1714
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,758
Hey!

1715
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,428
I'm gonna shove that cab
driver right up your ass.

1716
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,723
My body and my
hands are so soft.

1717
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:16,974
You should probably
head back to the car.

1718
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,643
I think I'll head
back to the car.

1719
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:22,605
It works best when
you pull the trigger.

1720
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:26,818
That gun is amazing!

1721
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:29,362
Say it!

1722
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:34,534
You are an abomination!

1723
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:45,128
Now, I'm gonna shove the
red guy up the old guy.

1724
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,630
I believe him! Every
man for themselves!

1725
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,094
Gotcha!

1726
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,054
Beat it, midget!

1727
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:00,768
Hey, big guy, the
sun's getting real low!

1728
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,270
Oh, shit fuck!

1729
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,743
Come here, beautiful.

1730
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,627
Whoo!

1731
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:36,929
Say it!

1732
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:01,472
You came for me.

1733
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,974
I'm not giving up on you,

1734
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,142
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

1735
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,228
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

1736
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,564
It's time to fight dirty.

1737
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:11,065
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

1738
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,901
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

1739
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,028
That's such a you thing to say!

1740
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,697
Go get him, tiger!

1741
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:19,991
Big CGI fight coming up!

1742
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,390
He's doing great.

1743
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,683
Say it!

1744
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,272
- Russell.
- Bingo!

1745
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:58,613
You see that bus?

1746
01:41:58,696 --> 01:41:59,780
I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

1747
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,244
That's right! I'm
fighting dirty!

1748
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:07,580
Oh, great!

1749
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:08,664
There they are! Those freaks!

1750
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,333
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

1751
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,460
Can I have one of those guns?

1752
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,670
No. That's fine.

1753
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:16,672
Get off this
property, mutant scum!

1754
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:17,840
I'm just gonna use this brick.

1755
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:19,592
Maximum effort.

1756
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,475
Who says you can't
go home again?

1757
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:37,985
on!

1758
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:45,618
Yeah!

1759
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,163
Say it.

1760
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,583
Say what you said every
time you tortured me!

1761
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,126
Say it!

1762
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,213
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

1763
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,049
Blessed are the wicked...

1764
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:01,801
who are healed...

1765
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,803
<i>b'! my hand.</i>

1766
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,572
You commie motherfucker!

1767
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,351
Oh, my God. Did
you feel that, too?

1768
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:55,438
Only best buddies execute
pedophiles together.

1769
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,526
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

1770
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:01,902
Now we're getting it.

1771
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:08,826
I need a bus to get
you all out of here.

1772
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:15,207
Orphans.

1773
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,585
Oh, geez.

1774
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,589
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

1775
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:24,258
A child should not be
burdened with such power!

1776
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,143
Russell! Wait!

1777
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:41,442
DEADPOOLI Oh!

1778
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:50,659
Wait! He hasn't
killed anyone yet!

1779
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,703
What more do you need to
see? Don't you fucking dare!

1780
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:53,954
He's just a kid!

1781
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:55,998
Tick, took. Meter's running!

1782
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,764
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

1783
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,787
I told you! Leave
me alone! Come on!

1784
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,455
Listen to me!

1785
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,313
That's how we do it

1786
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:02,857
in Mother Russia.

1787
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,611
They say millennials
are the hardest to reach.

1788
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:12,199
Oh, no. You're doing amazing.

1789
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:16,036
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

1790
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:18,163
Go home, Wade!

1791
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,165
You're ruining everything!

1792
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,714
I'm getting good at this shit.

1793
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:27,923
Go, go, go!

1794
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,262
He dies tonight, Wade.

1795
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:34,972
You can't stop me!

1796
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:37,683
He even runs like
a fucking pervert.

1797
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:40,603
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

1798
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:43,397
There's one bullet
left in that gun.

1799
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,441
Wait, wait, wait! Please,
just give me a second!

1800
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:46,942
I got this.

1801
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:49,236
Russell! Stay
back! Go home, Wade!

1802
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,530
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

1803
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:53,407
That piece of shit...

1804
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,451
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

1805
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:58,996
He hurt you badly. Makes
you wanna hurt others.

1806
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:01,540
But if you kill him, he wins.

1807
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:05,210
You become everything he
says you are, but worse.

1808
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:07,087
You're just a kid.

1809
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,298
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

1810
01:47:09,465 --> 01:47:10,591
How do you know what I want?

1811
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,384
Because I've been inside you.

1812
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:14,345
That came out wrong.

1813
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,555
I've been inside your shoes.

1814
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:18,474
Which is also off-putting.

1815
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,059
It's not a great analogy.

1816
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,560
The point is...

1817
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:23,687
there are people...

1818
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,690
There are people in
this fucking world...

1819
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,443
besides him, who
will treat you right.

1820
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,237
It isn't too late. Don't do it.

1821
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:40,162
I never should've
left you there.

1822
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,791
I never should've
left you in that prison.

1823
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:52,174
I can't trust you.

1824
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:56,261
I can't trust anybody!

1825
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:06,480
Wonderful kid.

1826
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,524
You can't stop me, Wade!

1827
01:48:10,776 --> 01:48:12,903
I got one more idea.

1828
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,948
It's just a really
bad one, even for me.

1829
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:17,199
Wade, what are you doing?

1830
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:18,909
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

1831
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:21,412
You're gonna kill
someone today...

1832
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,122
Blessed are the wicked...

1833
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:25,207
...then it's gotta be me.

1834
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:28,210
...who are healed by my hand!

1835
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:33,757
Fuck this!

1836
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:37,446
Tell me they got
that in slow motion.

1837
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:43,952
Oh, that's not good.

1838
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:46,955
No, sir.

1839
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,508
You sacrificed yourself for me.

1840
01:49:57,925 --> 01:49:59,051
Yeah.

1841
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:01,345
And it was the best
thing I ever did.

1842
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:05,390
I told you I care about you.

1843
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:07,226
You're a good kid, Russell.

1844
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,020
Hey.

1845
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:12,523
The bear.

1846
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,982
It worked.

1847
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,449
Because of you.

1848
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,910
No, Wade, because of you.

1849
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:27,830
Stop, stop, stop!

1850
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:29,081
Stop!

1851
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,793
Just let it happen, okay?

1852
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:36,171
I guess my heart was
finally in the right place.

1853
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:39,424
That riddle is so fucked up.

1854
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:46,515
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1855
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:47,808
Don't be. Don't be.

1856
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,643
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

1857
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:51,854
Please, just don't leave me.

1858
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,522
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

1859
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:55,190
We are not going anywhere.

1860
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,442
Oh, God, I hope the
Academy is watching.

1861
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:58,652
Just rest, okay?

1862
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:01,572
Papa.

1863
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,742
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

1864
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:14,001
<i>Papa, can you find
me in the night?</i>

1865
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:36,523
Before I go...

1866
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:38,775
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

1867
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,485
Domino.

1868
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:45,157
I want you to have my
Adventure Time watch.

1869
01:51:47,743 --> 01:51:50,621
Turns out that
I'm the lucky one.

1870
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:52,497
Thank you.

1871
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,752
Hey,SabHna, the Teenage Witch.

1872
01:51:57,127 --> 01:51:59,296
I liked you better
with your hair short.

1873
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:00,631
Think everyone did.

1874
01:52:01,423 --> 01:52:04,134
Hi, Yukio. Hi, Wade!

1875
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:07,262
And you...

1876
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:08,931
Chrome Bone.

1877
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:12,226
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

1878
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:15,062
But you've always
been that to me.

1879
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:16,521
So thank you.

1880
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:20,275
Say "fuck" for me.

1881
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:22,361
Just once. Come on,

1882
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,029
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

1883
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:27,115
Here we go. One, two,
three. F... F... F...

1884
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,200
Fuck.

1885
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:31,703
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

1886
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:35,290
And you, Cable.

1887
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:39,836
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

1888
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:43,924
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

1889
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:45,759
That you'll start
judging people...

1890
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:47,177
not by the color of their skin,

1891
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:49,137
but by the content
of their character.

1892
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:51,473
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

1893
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:54,601
There you are. Hey!

1894
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:56,937
You're a superhero now, bubba.

1895
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:00,399
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

1896
01:53:00,482 --> 01:53:01,858
This one is yours.

1897
01:53:01,942 --> 01:53:03,652
You might wanna get
it steam cleaned.

1898
01:53:03,735 --> 01:53:05,112
Especially around the pants.

1899
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,905
And let it out a
little in the waist.

1900
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:08,865
But, hey.

1901
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:10,993
Look.

1902
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:13,912
Family is not an F-word.

1903
01:53:14,663 --> 01:53:15,956
All right?

1904
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:17,916
There's one out there for you.

1905
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,210
Just keep looking, okay?

1906
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:26,466
Guys, for a second there...

1907
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:29,428
we made a pretty good team.

1908
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,486
Oh, it's so hard to go.

1909
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:50,365
I just love being
around you guys so much.

1910
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:52,701
So, so much.

1911
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:54,745
Mmm.

1912
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,997
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

1913
01:53:57,706 --> 01:54:01,460
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

1914
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:02,544
Yeah.

1915
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,256
Can you see it?

1916
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,134
Do you see that
beautiful bright light?

1917
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,762
There it is.

1918
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,227
Oh, that's the sun.

1919
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:21,146
Don't stare directly into that.

1920
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:22,647
I just have a few final words.

1921
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,276
<i>Woodpecker.</i>

1922
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:28,403
Gingivitis.

1923
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:31,823
Codswallop.

1924
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:38,121
<i>Do You Want to Build a Snowman?</i>

1925
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:54,281
Sorry I'm late.

1926
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:56,032
There was a bunch

1927
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,409
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

1928
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:58,702
No. No.

1929
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:02,456
But I did have to
help a kid. Yeah.

1930
01:56:02,914 --> 01:56:04,791
He's got a terrible
name. It's just awful.

1931
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:05,876
Ugh. l tried to tell him.

1932
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:09,629
Is this heaven?

1933
01:56:10,505 --> 01:56:11,715
It is now.

1934
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:17,053
I am so sorry.

1935
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:19,222
It's okay.

1936
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:40,952
I missed you so much.

1937
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,210
What is it? What's wrong?

1938
01:56:50,128 --> 01:56:51,630
It's not time.

1939
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,132
What do you mean it's not time?

1940
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:55,800
I'm here, I made it.

1941
01:56:55,967 --> 01:56:57,636
You can't stay. No,no,no.

1942
01:56:57,719 --> 01:57:00,347
I'm staying. I'm not
going anywhere without you.

1943
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,431
It's okay.

1944
01:57:01,932 --> 01:57:04,768
There's a time for
us. It's just not now.

1945
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:08,230
They need you. Who?

1946
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:11,566
Your F-word.

1947
01:57:12,817 --> 01:57:13,818
Why?

1948
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:14,903
You'll find out.

1949
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,697
It's all right. I'll be here.

1950
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:21,201
It's pretty fucking
awesome up here.

1951
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:23,745
I can have anything I want.

1952
01:57:23,828 --> 01:57:25,956
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

1953
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:27,415
It is heaven.

1954
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:28,875
I love you.

1955
01:57:31,378 --> 01:57:34,130
I know. I love you, too.

1956
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,132
Now, go.

1957
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:39,010
Go on. Go, get out of here.

1958
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:41,054
Go.

1959
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:44,849
Hey!

1960
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:50,021
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

1961
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,773
Well, come here.

1962
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:12,752
Don't fuck Elvis.

1963
01:58:12,877 --> 01:58:14,629
Ooh, too late. I'm sorry?

1964
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:25,348
Time to make the chimichangas.

1965
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,516
30 seconds.

1966
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,809
Hey. Been meaning to ask you...

1967
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:30,353
what's with the
creepy, dirty hobo bear?

1968
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:32,188
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

1969
01:58:32,647 --> 01:58:33,940
Her name's Hope.

1970
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:35,358
DEADPOOLI Well...

1971
01:58:36,192 --> 01:58:38,069
What are you doing?

1972
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:39,738
Somebody swiped right.

1973
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:54,919
Tell me they got
that in slow motion.

1974
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:00,008
You sacrificed yourself for me.

1975
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:01,593
It would seem I...

1976
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:05,055
Huh?

1977
01:59:06,181 --> 01:59:08,516
Genuine, high-grade lead.

1978
01:59:10,435 --> 01:59:13,438
You time-sliding son of a bitch!

1979
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,106
You did this for me?

1980
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:19,486
Wait. You can't go back.

1981
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:21,363
You used the last of your fuel.

1982
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:23,156
What about your girl, your wife?

1983
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:26,493
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

1984
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:30,372
No, I'm gonna stick
around for a while...

1985
01:59:30,455 --> 01:59:31,665
and make sure the world

1986
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,458
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

1987
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:37,045
No. You did it for me.

1988
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:39,130
No, I didn't.

1989
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:40,674
You did. I really didn't.

1990
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:42,550
Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.

1991
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:44,386
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

1992
01:59:44,469 --> 01:59:47,180
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

1993
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:49,683
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

1994
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,101
Say it again.

1995
01:59:51,267 --> 01:59:52,811
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

1996
01:59:52,894 --> 01:59:54,646
We must get the collar
off. Forget it. It's no use.

1997
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:56,606
These collars
don't just come off.

1998
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:57,691
Wade.

1999
01:59:58,233 --> 01:59:59,859
I have an idea.

2000
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,278
No,no,no! Let's
not do that. Please!

2001
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,739
I'd rather die of
cancer. Let's just...

2002
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:07,951
Oh, God! They do say the
pen is grosser than the sword.

2003
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:10,286
We need the code.

2004
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,247
Try, uh, seven?

2005
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:13,873
Settle down, Captain Lucky.

2006
02:00:13,957 --> 02:00:15,375
It's not gonna be one number.

2007
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:16,543
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

2008
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:18,878
I still got it.

2009
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:23,883
Put that back in
your prison wallet.

2010
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:27,470
I don't know how to thank you.

2011
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:29,055
But I do know how to hug you.

2012
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:30,765
No. Yes.

2013
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:32,308
Here we go. Bring it in.

2014
02:00:32,392 --> 02:00:33,393
Come on.

2015
02:00:33,518 --> 02:00:34,811
Pelvis to pelvis.

2016
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:36,229
Let's go tip to tip.

2017
02:00:36,396 --> 02:00:38,898
There we go. The kids
call this docking.

2018
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:41,776
ls there a knife in my dick?

2019
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:44,028
There's a knife in your dick.
I'm just gonna back up now.

2020
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:45,947
Yeah, yeah. No need
to go full Yentl.

2021
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:48,700
Gonna pretend like
that never happened.

2022
02:00:48,867 --> 02:00:50,785
Let's go home, Russell.

2023
02:00:54,456 --> 02:00:56,207
All you dirty mutants

2024
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,710
are gonna rot in
hell with the boy!

2025
02:00:58,877 --> 02:01:01,838
Your souls are
beyond redemption!

2026
02:01:02,005 --> 02:01:03,256
Let's see your soul, perv!

2027
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,134
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

2028
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:07,385
We're better than him!

2029
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:10,138
No more senseless
violence! No more bloodshed!

2030
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:11,765
We'll let karma
take care of him.

2031
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:14,851
The day of reckoning is here!

2032
02:01:24,194 --> 02:01:26,196
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

2033
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:27,489
Whoo!

2034
02:01:27,572 --> 02:01:29,073
Courage, motherfuckers!

2035
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,492
And karma, motherfucker.

2036
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:32,118
I could hear you coming
the last 30 seconds.

2037
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:34,162
I could barely keep
a straight face.

2038
02:01:34,245 --> 02:01:36,039
I want some more.

2039
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:37,874
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

2040
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:40,960
We should leave before
Fuckernaut wakes up.

2041
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:43,671
Good call. You
guys coming with us?

2042
02:01:43,838 --> 02:01:45,757
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

2043
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,133
Besides, we're X-Men.

2044
02:01:47,425 --> 02:01:49,969
No, you're X-People.

2045
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:51,429
You're exhausting.

2046
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:53,181
I see what you did there. Puns.

2047
02:01:53,348 --> 02:01:54,724
Our door's always open.

2048
02:01:54,808 --> 02:01:56,559
That's kind, but I'm
not ready to date again.

2049
02:01:56,643 --> 02:01:57,644
Let alone two women.

2050
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:00,396
God, you're a douche.

2051
02:02:00,522 --> 02:02:02,607
Bye, Wade! Bye, Yukio!

2052
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,402
<i>What do you get</i>

2053
02:02:06,486 --> 02:02:07,570
<i>when you take eight
feet of chrome...</i>

2054
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:08,780
<i>one pinch of courage...</i>

2055
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:10,073
<i>a cup of good luck...</i>

2056
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:11,658
<i>a dab of racism...</i>

2057
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:12,909
<i>a splash of diabetes...</i>

2058
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,328
<i>and a wheelbarrow full
of stage four cancer?</i>

2059
02:02:15,745 --> 02:02:17,914
<i>Answer: a family.</i>

2060
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:21,584
<i>See? I didn't lie what
kind of film this was.</i>

2061
02:02:21,668 --> 02:02:22,961
<i>If there's anything
you take away today...</i>

2062
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:26,172
<i>other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...</i>

2063
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,050
<i>it's that we all need
to belong to someone.</i>

2064
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:27,835
How something so small generates

2065
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:29,462
enough energy to
reverse time is...

2066
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:31,881
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2067
02:04:31,965 --> 02:04:34,217
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

2068
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:35,468
Cable's gonna kill
you when he finds out.

2069
02:04:35,551 --> 02:04:36,552
Never heard of him.

2070
02:04:36,636 --> 02:04:38,096
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

2071
02:04:39,389 --> 02:04:41,599
The Lord works in
mysterious ways,

2072
02:04:41,683 --> 02:04:43,935
don't I? A good day.

2073
02:04:44,686 --> 02:04:45,687
Bye, Wade!

2074
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:47,188
Bye, Yukio!

2075
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:50,733
That was probably a bad idea.

2076
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,193
What have we done?

2077
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:12,630
I hope we sharpened the
cream cheese spreader.

2078
02:05:22,807 --> 02:05:24,267
I'll be right back!

2079
02:05:26,227 --> 02:05:28,771
We're definitely
naming our kid Cher!

2080
02:05:29,147 --> 02:05:30,148
Whoo!

2081
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:33,234
Peter!

2082
02:05:33,317 --> 02:05:34,861
Whoo! X-Force!

2083
02:05:34,944 --> 02:05:37,155
Walk away! Just walk away!

2084
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:39,866
But we're X-Force!
Nope! We're not.

2085
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:41,409
X-Force is just a marketing tool

2086
02:05:41,492 --> 02:05:42,744
designed by Fox executives...

2087
02:05:42,827 --> 02:05:44,495
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

2088
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:45,872
It doesn't exist.

2089
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:49,333
All right, well, this
has been pretty scary!

2090
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,044
And I need to feed my cat!

2091
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,588
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

2092
02:05:53,755 --> 02:05:57,008
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

2093
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:08,061
Wade, is that you?

2094
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:11,647
I guess Stryker finally

2095
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:13,107
figured out how to shut you up.

2096
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:22,950
Hey! It's me! Don't scratch!

2097
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:25,119
Just cleaning up the timelines!

2098
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:28,998
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

2099
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:31,334
and it's gonna make a
lot of people very sad.

2100
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:32,710
Huh?

2101
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:34,420
But one day, your old
pal Wade's gonna ask you...

2102
02:06:34,504 --> 02:06:36,464
to get back in the saddle again.

2103
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,884
And when he does, say yes.

2104
02:06:41,135 --> 02:06:43,096
Oh, right.

2105
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:45,306
Love you!

2106
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:49,310
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2107
02:06:56,692 --> 02:06:58,528
You're welcome, Canada.

2108
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,208
Boy howdy.

2109
02:07:14,085 --> 02:07:16,963
Hi. This is a toughie.

2110
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:18,047
Yeesh.

2111
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:20,758
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

2112
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:24,762
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

2113
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:27,640
Jesus Christ! This is so
much harder than I thought.

2114
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:30,059
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2115
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:31,727
That makes two of us.

2116
02:07:31,894 --> 02:07:32,979
You can do this.

2117
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:36,149
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

2118
02:07:36,232 --> 02:07:37,400
All right.

2119
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,659
Maximum effort.

2120
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:27,082
That's okay. Let me see here.

2121
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:28,626
Oh, God.

2122
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:30,628
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

2123
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:32,630
No one's ever changed you.

2124
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:35,841
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

2125
02:13:35,925 --> 02:13:38,385
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

2126
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:41,305
which would makes
sense, wouldn't it? Yeah.

2127
02:13:41,388 --> 02:13:42,515
I think we both know

2128
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:43,724
I don't have what it
takes to do this...

2129
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:46,185
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

2130
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:48,145
and then I'm gonna come
back with my friend, Cable.

2131
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:49,563
He loves killing kids.
