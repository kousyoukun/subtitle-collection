1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,575
Hey, man, fuck that!

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:06,086
Them niggas around the corner
tripped out, man.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,415
- Fuck that shit, man!
- Let's go. I'll take my car.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,884
Oh, fuck that. We should've
let these niggas have it.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,588
- Just pull up, just pull up.
- Get your shit ready, nigga.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:17,968
Damn!

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,096
These niggas here?

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,803
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,767
Look out, nigga! What's up, punk?!

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,365
Possible 187 at corner of
crenshaw and century.

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,624
They shot my brother!

12
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,273
Tre, you do your homework?
“What homework?

13
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,480
- Yeah, I did it.
- Can I copy it?

14
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,650
Hell, no. Too bad,
you should've done it.

15
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,946
- Did you hear the shooting last night?
- Yeah, I got under my bed.

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,826
Man, you a scaredy-cat.

17
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,289
My mama say, "a bullet
don't have no name on it."

18
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,792
I ain't afraid. My brothers
been shot and they still alive.

19
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,669
They lucky.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,339
Y'all want to see something?

21
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,470
What?

22
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,048
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?

23
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,352
Is that blood?

24
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,728
What happened?

25
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,612
Somebody got smoked.
Look at the hole in the wall, stupid.

26
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,906
Least I can tell my times tables.

27
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,739
Look! Why is the blood
turning yellow?

28
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,246
That's what happens when it
separates from the plasma.

29
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,908
So that's how the settlers
survived that long hard winter...

30
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,955
That took so many of their lives,
is by eating foods...

31
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:59,336
That were given to them,
like the Turkey and the squash...

32
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:04,761
And all the foods that we think of
as our traditional holiday meal.

33
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,434
And that's why we celebrate
Thanksgiving...

34
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,639
To commemorate the unity
between the Indians...

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,609
Excuse me

36
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,893
the native Americans.

37
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,777
And the early english settlers
who were called class?

38
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,782
Pilgrims.

39
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,285
That's right, the pilgrims.
Very good.

40
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,782
The penguins!

41
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,453
Who said that?

42
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,995
- Mr. styles.
- That's me.

43
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,084
How is it you always have
something funny to say?

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,006
Because I'm a comedian.

45
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,629
Would you like to come up
and teach the class?

46
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,014
Yeah, I can do that.

47
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,885
Very well, come on up. Instruct us.

48
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,812
What's the basis of your lecture?
“What?

49
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,484
What are you going to talk about?

50
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,945
I'd tell you if you let me talk.

51
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,500
What's the name of this place?
“That's Africa. I know that

52
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,168
right, that's Africa.

53
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,165
Did you know that Africa is where
the body of the first man was found?

54
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,210
My daddy says that's where
all people originated from.

55
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,223
All y'all. Everybody.

56
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,555
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from crenshaw mafia!

57
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,814
Like it or not, you from Africa.

58
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,316
I ain't from Africa. You from Africa.
You African Booty-scratcher!

59
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,526
Quiet.

60
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,357
Punk, I'll kick your ass.

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,242
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.

62
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,203
I'll get my brother to shoot you!

63
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,370
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy. Least I got one.

64
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,544
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!

65
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,206
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now! That's enough!

66
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:09,097
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.

67
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,224
It's just that...

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,885
Yes, go on.

69
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,351
It's just that he has
a very bad temper.

70
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,060
It's extremely difficult for him
to interact with the other children.

71
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,737
Perhaps I could recommend therapy
or a child psychologist.

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,573
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.

73
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:31,870
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?

74
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,581
That's none of your business...

75
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,913
But I am employed, and I'm studying
for my master's degree.

76
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,088
- Then you are educated.
- We gonna talk about me or my son?

77
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,254
Well, we'll be happy to see tre
back in class on Tuesday.

79
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,257
His suspension was only
for three days, you know.

80
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,097
- No. You won't be seeing tre again.
- And why is that, may I ask?

81
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,231
- Tre is going to live with his father.
- His father?

82
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:04,607
Yes, his father. Or did you think
we made babies by ourselves?

83
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,446
- You tell her go jump in the lake?
- What was our agreement?

84
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,952
What did we put down in writing?

85
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,252
"L, tre styles,
being of sound mind and body...

86
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,580
Agree not to get into any disputes,
physical or verbal...

87
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,964
For the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this.

88
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:33,299
I will go to live with my father,
Mr. furious styles."

89
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,806
"Signed..."
oh, now, who wrote this?

90
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,102
"Tre styles."

91
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,486
You have to work on
your handwriting.

92
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,953
Bean pies. World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?

93
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,208
I just don't want to
see you end up dead.

94
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,001
Or in jall.

95
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,677
A drunk, standing in front
of one of these liquor stores.

96
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,091
Can you understand?

97
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,018
I ook at me. I'm serious.

98
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,480
I love youl.

99
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,027
You're my only son.

100
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,184
How you doing?

101
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,693
- I'm fine. How about yourself?
- I'm living. That's enough for me.

102
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,232
Well, here he is.

103
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,032
- What's the matter? You can't say hi?
- Hi, daddy.

104
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,582
Go ahead, talk to your friends.

105
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,260
- What's up, tre?
- What's up, doughboy?

106
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,593
Well, there goes your son.

107
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,433
You wanted him, you got him.

108
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,812
Why you trying to make this
so easy?

109
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,235
Well, it's like you told me:

110
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,951
I can't teach him how to be a man.

111
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,829
That's your job.

112
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,286
So it ain't no weekly thing
no more, huh?

113
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,120
You staying for good?

114
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,254
Chris, you know tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?

115
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,712
Yeah. You the one collect
all those comic books.

116
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,512
You living here now?

117
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,306
Thank you, reva.

118
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,012
Furious.

119
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,940
- Take care of my baby.
- He is my baby too.

120
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,148
You still collect comics?

121
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,323
This fool got more comics
than a motherfucker.

122
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,530
- Tre, come here.
- Watch my stuff.

123
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,827
What up, tre?

124
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,662
What's up, Rick?

125
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,301
Well, it looks like you got
all your friends over here.

126
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,839
When you coming to pick me up?

127
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,142
Listen.

128
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,183
This is just a temporary thing.

129
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,358
When I get out of school, I'll get
a better job, a better place to stay.

130
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,693
Maybe a house?

131
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:18,899
Then you can come back,
and things will be better. Okay?

132
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,862
Okay, mom.

133
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,037
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

134
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,668
- Love you, love you.
- Me too. Bye, mommy.

135
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,337
- Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
- I ain't got no troubles.

136
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,711
- You got some troubles?
- I. Awn trouble.

137
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,543
- Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
- How much?

138
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,929
I'll give you $5
for the whole lawn.

139
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,342
Five dollars. Man, that ain't shit.

140
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,225
- I can make more doing nothing.
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?

141
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,188
He work for his uncle.

142
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,064
That's too bad. I guess I just
have to get my son to do it for me.

143
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,443
Do what?

144
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,446
Want you to rake up these leaves
off the lawn.

145
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:04,444
Boy, don't look at me funny if I
ask you to do something. Take this.

146
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,913
There's two trash bags right there
on the ground. See y'all later.

147
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,708
Damn, your daddy mean. He's worse
than the bogeyman himself.

148
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,841
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, kunta kinte?

149
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,548
- Later, tre.
- L_ ater.

150
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,762
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.

151
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,642
Shut up, fool. Yeah, there is.

152
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,728
If there is, I'll bet you hulk
could whip his ass.

153
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,649
Yeah, later.

154
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,733
Tre, I gotta lay down
the rules of the house.

155
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,643
Same thing as weekends,
you remember?

156
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,481
All right, what are they?

157
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,778
Clean the bathroom sink,
floor and tub.

158
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,825
I gotta clean that tub?

159
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,499
Clean my room and water the lawn.

160
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,624
Dad, can I ask you something?

161
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,334
What do you have to do
around here?

162
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,518
I don't have to do nothing around here
except for pay the bills...

163
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,939
Put food on the table and put clothes
on your back, you understand?

164
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,559
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.

165
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,363
You may think I'm being hard
on you right now, but I'm not.

166
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,742
I'm trying to teach you
how to be responsible.

167
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,701
Your friends across the street,
they don't have anybody to show them.

168
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,208
You gonna see how they end up too.

169
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,332
I'm glad you're here, tre.

170
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,672
You're a prince, you know that?

171
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,966
Yeah. You're the prince...

172
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,048
I'm the king.

173
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,019
Right now, the king says it's time
for the prince to go to bed.

174
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,688
So get yourself together.

175
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,061
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

176
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,417
Oh, shit!

177
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,831
Somebody must've prayed
for that fool

178
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:31,003
I swear I aimed right for his head.
Should've blew it off

179
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,511
don't say that.

180
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,798
Don't say that.

181
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,144
It'd be contributing to killing
another brother.

182
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,528
Man, where are these fools?

183
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,993
We've been waiting out here
for almost an hour.

184
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,174
- We got a call of a burglary here.
- That was about an hour ago.

185
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,889
We didn't ask you that.

186
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,637
Yeah, well, I told you.

187
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,732
Besides, I don't like having
my son out in the cold.

188
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,225
Just tell me what happened, sir.

189
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,065
Somebody broke into the house.

190
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,148
I fired at him with my piece,
and he ran away.

191
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,902
- You didn't get him?
- If I did, he'd be laid out here.

192
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,950
- Is there anything missing?
- No.

193
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,741
(Good, no need to make out a report.

194
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,253
Got a 415 on Florence
between Vermont and normandie.

195
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,423
Too bad you didn't get him.

196
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,211
Be one less nigger out here
we have to worry about.

197
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,720
Hey, little man, how you doing?

198
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,939
Go on in the house, tre. Go on.

199
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,610
- Something wrong?
- Something wrong? Yeah.

200
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,448
It's just too bad
you don't know what it is...

201
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,990
Brother.

202
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,504
Ice cream man!

203
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,298
Wait up!

204
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,861
- What's up, tre?
- What's up?

205
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,156
You ain't shit

206
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,953
you just like your daddy.

207
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,453
You don't do shit and you
never gonna amount to shit.

208
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,753
All you ever do around here
is eat, sleep and shit.

209
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,125
Look at this place. Way y'all act,
y'all must think I'm the maid.

210
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,302
- Is that it? I gotta go.
- Hell, no, it ain't it!

211
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,347
It ain't it till I say it's it, damn it!

212
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,975
Cigarette.

213
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:30,147
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock
your ass in the middle of next week.

214
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,274
Where you going, you little fat fuck?
You ain't got a job.

215
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,907
Who's that little fucker
on my porch?

216
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,660
Oh, you're furious' little boy, huh?

217
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,919
Boy, you look more and more
like your daddy every day.

218
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,382
So tell me something.

219
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,381
How come he don't play cards
with us no more?

220
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,882
I don't know.

221
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,097
I know he don't think
he's better than us.

222
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,384
Too busy shooting at people.

223
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,095
I heard what happened there
the other night.

224
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,729
He still got that same girlfriend?

225
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,435
Excuse me, mama.

226
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:23,367
- Why do you always play football”?
- Because that's what I'm gonna do.

227
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,944
That's right.

228
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,918
I heard furious shot
at somebody last night.

229
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,961
- He get him?
- No.

230
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,592
Who is that?

231
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,759
That's my lady, homey.
Her name's Brandi.

232
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,432
She ain't your woman.
She's my woman.

233
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,968
- How, when she my lady?
- She's my wife.

234
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:53,105
I stick my ding-a-ling in her
every night, so that makes her mine.

235
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,897
Get your ass in here and quit
looking at them boys!

236
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,353
Punk!

237
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,233
Faggot!

238
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,158
Get off me, with your big
4-by-4 head! Get off!

239
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,069
(Set off!

240
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,573
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.

241
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,660
- Where's my ball?
- Man, don't bring that ball.

242
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,874
Me and my daddy going fishing.

243
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,751
We ain't gonna stay long.

244
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,008
- Where's he live?
- He don't live far.

245
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:33,388
Rick, why you have to bring that ball”?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.

246
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,149
Y'all want to see a dead body?

247
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,019
Yeah

248
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,439
tre's daddy blasted
at somebody last night.

249
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,275
Really? What kind of gun
your daddy got?

250
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,946
I think it's a .357 Magnum.

251
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,157
Really? I got a deuce-deuce.

252
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,125
My brother gave it to me
before he went to jail.

253
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,205
I got it under my bed. Want to see?
It's loaded too.

254
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,430
It's up in here.

255
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,731
Damn!

256
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,864
It smell like a dog died.

257
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,824
- Look like Freddy krueger got him.
- He stink.

258
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,539
That's how they smell after a while.

259
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,997
I wonder why it take them people
so long to pick him up.

260
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,376
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.

261
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:46,044
- Oh, man.
- Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!

262
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,214
- Hey, throw the ball.
- You ain't gonna see it again.

263
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,849
Don't you know this is a dead body?

264
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,973
Yeah, I know that shit!

265
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,688
He ain't bothering you,
so don't fuck with him!

266
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,725
Throw the ball, little man.

267
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,977
I ain't gonna take it.

268
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,563
Chris, tell him I ain't
gonna take his ball.

269
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,571
I got enough money to buy me
9 hundred balls. Shit!

270
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,747
Man, I told you not to bring that ball.

271
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,413
Thanks, coz.

272
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,089
Yo, dog.

273
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,292
Throw the ball.

274
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,254
Shit.

275
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,423
Let's start the game, man.

276
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,513
Man, you stupid!
Don't have no sense.

277
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,815
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell mama.

278
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,401
Man, shut up. I don't care.
Tell mama.

279
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,113
Y'all leaving?

280
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,741
Hell, no.

281
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,784
Give me my brother's ball back!

282
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,325
- No, no!
- Come on, man!

283
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,413
No, don't say nothing.
They're just playing.

284
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,289
- Give me my brother's ball back!
- What'd you say, fat boy?

285
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,338
Give me my brother's ball back be...
Before what?

286
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,253
What your fat ass gonna do?

287
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,849
Yo, rock! Give the little nigga
the ball back.

288
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,314
Stupid motherfucker!

289
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,984
I was gonna give it to you too.

290
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,496
Man!

291
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,505
Hey, man, I got a football.

292
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,796
I never use it myself.

293
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,180
- I give it to you when we get home.
- He ain't gonna want it.

294
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,848
His daddy gave him that ball.

295
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,806
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.

296
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,992
Yo, rock, give me the ball.

297
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,248
Give me the fucking ball!

298
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,715
Hey!

299
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,718
Hey, little man!

300
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,385
Catch!

301
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,019
Man, you sorry.

302
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,193
- I'm going to the store.
- Why? You ain't got no money.

303
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,397
I'm going anyway.

304
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,363
- So you a leader or a follower?
- I'm a leader.

305
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,699
Okay, then. What's the three rules?

306
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,080
Break it down for me. And, hey...

307
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,587
- Think before you answer.
- I got it!

308
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:14,460
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.

309
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,802
Two was to never be afraid
to ask you for anything.

310
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,929
Stealing isn't necessary.

311
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,681
And the last one, I think, was...

312
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,022
To never respect anybody
who doesn't respect you back.

313
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,773
That right?

314
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,399
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

315
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,451
What do you know about sex?

316
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,295
- I know a little bit.
- Oh, yeah? What little bit is that?

317
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,047
I know, I take a girl...

318
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,466
Stick my thing in her...

319
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,419
And nine months later
a baby comes out.

320
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,050
You think that's it?

321
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,307
Basically, yeah.

322
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,183
Well, remember this:

323
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,321
Any fool with a dick can make a baby,
but only a real man can raise his kids.

324
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,743
I wasn't but 17 when your mother
was pregnant with you.

325
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,827
All of my friends was dropping out
of high school...

326
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,499
Nanging out in front of liquor stores,
getting drunk, getting high.

327
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,795
Some of them was robbing people.

328
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,256
Some of them was
even killing people.

329
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,014
Hey, you remember
my friend Marcus?

330
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,019
He got into robbing people,
wanted me to join him...

331
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,443
But I said,
"no, I'm getting ready to have a son."

332
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,525
I knew you'd be a boy.

333
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,200
I wanted to be somebody
you could look up to.

334
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,117
So I guess that's why
I went to vietham_

335
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,042
Don't ever go in the army, tre.

336
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,376
Black man ain't got no place
in the army.

337
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,547
Damn!

338
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,013
Why'd you get it all over me?

339
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,637
Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
“What?

340
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,732
Oh, wait! Listen to this song!
I love this song!

341
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,239
Oh, damn!

342
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,534
Looks like they going to juvie.

343
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,338
No, man. They going to the gates.

344
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,837
- Yo, man, what happened?
- They were stealing.

345
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,560
Come on, tre. Let's go, son.

346
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,382
Come here, Rick.

347
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,505
Come on, man.

348
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,005
Come here, man. Look at all
these people back here.

349
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,633
There you go!

350
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,060
Want to learn how to barbecue?

351
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,394
You're not watching this meat.
You just standing here poking at it.

352
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,067
- Give him to me, Ricky.
- Shanice, I got him.

353
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,860
(Go on back to your friends.

354
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,152
- He's wet. That's why he's crying.
- He ain't wet. Now, go on back.

355
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,284
- Okay.
- Listen, I'm sorry. Come here.

356
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,702
See”? That's how y'all got that one.

357
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,378
Ricky, you make sure
she taking them pills.

358
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,838
I don't want a whole stack
of these around.

359
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,295
I'll be the one taking care of them.

360
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,052
- I'll put him to bed.
- Go on to grandma.

361
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,390
It's all right. All right,
okay, shut up, come on.

362
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,687
And flip that meat over.

363
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,356
I'm winning.

364
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,816
Domino, motherfuckers.
What you say about that?

365
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,867
Fool, that ain't shit.
I beat your ass three times already.

366
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,323
That's just once. Let's play again.

367
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,250
Fuck that, I don't want to play no more.
Let's bust some spades.

368
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,915
- Yeah, I'm with that.
- Bust some spades”?

369
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,709
Cool.

370
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,932
- Know how to play spades, dook?
- Something like that.

371
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:57,136
I have something for you to suck on.
Here, cut that, g.

372
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,269
I want one of them hootchies
over there.

373
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:12,359
Dooky, you full of shit. No bitch
gonna give your ugly ass no pussy.

374
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,407
I bet I get more pussy than you.

375
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,283
Yeah

376
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,782
you get dopehead pussy.

377
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,123
I get more pussy than your
wannabe mack-daddy ass...

378
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,084
- Who you calling wannabe mack?
- You, nigga!

379
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,628
No-pussy-getting motherfucker!

380
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,795
Fucking them dopeheads,
you stupid-ass nigga.

381
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,635
You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dopeheads.

382
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,802
I let them suck my dick,
but I don't fuck them.

383
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,262
They got aids and shit.

384
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:44,475
You can catch that shit from letting
them suck on your dick too.

385
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,809
Thank you.

386
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,772
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.

387
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,982
What you mean, you ain't skinny?

388
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,490
Motherfucker's skinny enough to
hula hoop through a cheerio.

389
00:31:55,789 --> 00:32:00,909
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.

390
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,457
- Mark ass.
- Y'all trying to scare me.

391
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,714
Can you really get it from
letting them suck it?

392
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,420
Mark.

393
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,196
Tre'? How you doing, baby?

394
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,366
- Fine.
- Good, you just in time for the food.

395
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,872
I'm bringing out
the rest of the things.

396
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,454
Potato salad. You name it, we got it.

397
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,705
- Everybody's here, have a good time.
- Okay.

398
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,378
Oh, and tre? Baby, do me a favour.

399
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:54,086
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?

400
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,760
I am so sick and tired of him
going in and out of there.

401
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,017
Maybe some of what you got
will rub off on him.

402
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,886
Okay.

403
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,482
What's up, dough?

404
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,779
Oh, shit! What up, g?
Tre, love in effect.

405
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,573
Yo, what's up, tre?

406
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,911

- Heard you're like Mr. gq smooth.

407
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:28,503
- Working over at the fox hills mall?
- I get discounts on clothes, you like?

408
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,919
You look like you selling rocks.

409
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:36,253
- Tre, you be slinging that shit?
- No, I don't be doing that shit.

410
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,427
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.

411
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,517
You know, I'm out of the pen now.

412
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,105
Trying to keep my ass out this time.

413
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,109
That's what we here to celebrate.
Yeah

414
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,650

how did you get so big?

415
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,324
Pumping iron and eating, man.

416
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,077
Nothing else to do in
the motherfucking pen.

417
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,414
Three hots and a cot,
know what I'm saying?

418
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,243
Rest of the time I was reading
and writing my girl.

419
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,670
- Reading?
- Yeah, motherfucker.

420
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,166
I ain't no criminal. I can read, bitch.

421
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,177
Who is that, shanice?

422
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,680
That's tre, Ricky's best friend.

423
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,809
He was best friends with doughboy
when they was little.

424
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,311
They be trying to act
like they brothers.

425
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,269
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!

426
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,319

00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,447

He work at the fox hills mall

428
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,867

429
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,323
Yes

430
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,340
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping
on this ho's man.

431
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,678
He fine, anyway. You better watch

00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,231
Come on.

435
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,527
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen
and let these ladies eat first!

436
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,373
Yeah, you act like you ain't
never had no barbecue before.

437
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,209
Let the ladies eat.
Ho's gotta eat too.

438
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,663
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho

439
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,215

440
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,919
- Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
- Just playing.

441
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,929
All right, enjoy. And be nice.

442
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,431
Get out of the way!
You still up here?

443
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,848
- Hi.
- Hello.

444
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,141
So why haven't you called?

445
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,528
Just one minute.

446
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,576
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.

447
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,412
- I know. I'm just taking my time.
- Oh, I see.

448
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,542
- You trying to run that game on her.
- Yeah, how am I doing?

449
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,423
Well, you're doing just fine.

450
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,963
- Except for one thing.
- Yeah, what's that?

451
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,426
She left

452
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,886

453
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,227
- Damn!
- That's all right.

454
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,897
Hey, hey, hey.

455
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,446
Ain't this a bitch?

456
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,610
Wait! Wait!

457
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,950
- Don't worry about it. I got her.
- Is she all right?

458
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,453
All right, g.

459
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,297
Sheryl! Come on!

460
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,805
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.

461
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,731
You got some blow?
You got some rock?

462
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:22,320
- I'll suck your dick.
- Just keep the baby out the streets.

463
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:27,317
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.

464
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,670
What up, punk? What up, fool?

465
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,676
Mark.

466
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,357
What is that”? Barbecue? Yeah

467
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,872
- I know you didn't bring me no swine.
- No.

468
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,784
Mrs. baker told me
to bring you a plate.

469
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,711
Brenda, huh? Yeah

470
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,045
she might've had a chance
if she didn't talk so much.

471
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,378
I et's see.

472
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:40,516
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.

473
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,112
Hey, pop, can you fix my fade
back here? And up here?

474
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,235
I'm eating.

475
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,109
After you eat.

476
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,329
Yeah

477
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,202
yeah, real close.

478
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,914
So I can brush it, you know,
hook up some waves.

479
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,470
Something wrong?

480
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,098
Nope.

481
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,476
What's the problem?

482
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,612
You're getting old, pop.

483
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,866
I'm getting old? Yeah

484
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,945
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.

485
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,655
- You older than dirt.
- I'm older than dirt?

486
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:42,077
- Yes.
- I ain't but 17 years older than you.

487
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,414
Your friends, they got fathers
in their 40s and 50s.

488
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,501
These cats are great big...
Just slobs, man.

489
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,513
- You know, bellies out to here.
- Yes. That's gonna be you!

490
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,971
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old, fat, juicy roll...

491
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,802
Double-jelly-roll belly. Right”?

492
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,811
Sitting in a rocking chair,
reading the funny papers!

493
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,110
Then your grandchildren will be
running around, saying:

494
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,985
"Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar."

495
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,315
You think so, huh?

496
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,945
Yeah

497
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,990
wait a minute, man.

498
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,118
What's all this
about grandkids, man?

499
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,121
You using the rubbers I gave you?

500
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,420
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy,
all right? I just...

501
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,169
I ain't ready for all of that.

502
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,838
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

503
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,344
Why are you sweating me, man?

504
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,307
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it. Come here.

505
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,720
What?

506
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,473
All right?

507
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,947
What? I stink now?
I got something on me?

508
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,859
You had some pussy yet? “What?

509
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,496
You had some pussy yet?
Yeah! Yeah!

510
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,948
When?

511
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,996
What? “When?

512
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,706
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.

513
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,874
Go on, sit down, now.

514
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:24,558
It was a Sunday, right? Rick and I
were kicking it up on crenshaw.

515
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,223
This group of females
rolled up in a rabbit.

516
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:32,396
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?

517
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:37,192
Man, there was this one girl
everybody was trying to rush.

518
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,869
Baby was fine!

519
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,540
Body was booming,
like right out of jet centrefold.

520
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,584
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.

521
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,623
She walks right up on me
and busts out, "is this your ride?"

522
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,426
Then I say, "yeah, you want to go
for a ride with me?"

523
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,884
She says, "no, I want to drive it."

524
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,718
I say, "can you drive stick?"

525
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,101
She says,
"I can learn if you teach me."

526
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:13,020
I go info mack-daddy mode because
I'm getting a Woody in my sweats.

527
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,949
I says, "why don't you give me your
number, I'll call you for a lesson.”

528
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,948
She does

529
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,121
about a week later,
I'm over at her house.

530
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,166
Her mom and grandma
are leaving for church.

531
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,952
I walk right up to the door, man.

532
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,631
As soon as I go inside, boom!
We go at it, nonstop.

533
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,462
Kissing, hugging, right?

534
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,636
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.

535
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:46,140
Well, about 20 minutes info it,
mom and grandma's come home.

536
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,563
Seems grandma forgot her purse.

537
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:52,191
Wanted to make sure she has
something for the collection plate.

538
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,565
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex
in the air or something, right?

539
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,452
She starts straight
towards tisha's room.

540
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,876
That's the last I ever saw of tisha.

541
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,000
I call her once in a while

542
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:22,673
but when I do, her mom or grandma
say, "she can't talk right now.

543
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,592
She busy, doing the dishes."

544
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,519
- What'd you use?
- Ll used the number she gave me.

545
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,186
Why are you sweating me?

546
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,364
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.

547
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,161
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...

548
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,413
You use something anyway.

549
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,045
A pill ain't gonna keep
your dick from falling off.

550
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,552
I don't know why you insist on
learning things the hard way...

551
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,383
But you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!

552
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,730
Clean up that hair.

553
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,026
What's up, man?

554
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,571
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
“What?

555
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,283
You slamming my door like
some gorilla on a football field!

556
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:36,079
- Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

557
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,089
Guess what, man.

558
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,759
Recruiter from sc's coming tonight.
Cool.

559
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,388
You know, man,
I never lied to my father.

560
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,272
Never?

561
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,188
Well, almost never.

562
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,063
Where's all this coming from?

563
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,239
Where's all this coming from?

564
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,820
I lied to pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.

565
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,451
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?

566
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,620
Is you?

567
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,956
Well, technically speaking, I haven't.

568
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,501
You know, I fingered
a couple of honeys...

569
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:24,423
And sucked on some titties,
but I ain't never stuck it in.

570
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,924
Why not, man?

571
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,849
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, I asked you, didn't 1?

572
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,102
I was afraid.

573
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,477
- Shit!
- Get off me.

574
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,529
- See, man? Shut up. Shut up.
- What you doing, man?

575
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,371
What you afraid of, man?

576
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,752
Of being a daddy.

577
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,464
Oh, well, yeah.

578
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,338
But I'm getting old now, see?

579
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:08,471
And now that I want to flap some
skins, Brandi ain't even down for it.

580
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:13,017
- Even with a Jimmy she ain't down.
- Is that right?

581
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,104
Straight up?

582
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,359
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that

583
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,239
what's that?

584
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,525
All right, you got it.

585
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,195
- I don't see that.
- Why the silent treatment?

586
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,659
You haven't talked to me
in five days!

587
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,036
You tell your father to say
you're not home.

588
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:41,163
- Then you take the phone off the hook!
- Well, I been busy.

589
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:46,001
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass
excuse for a lie like that!

590
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:50,388
What did I do that was so bad that
you just had to stop talking to me?

591
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,717
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the programme.

592
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,689
I told you about that. I'm catholic,
and it goes against my morals.

593
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,690
Yeah, but catholic girls are supposed
to be one of the biggest hootchies.

594
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:09,740
- When you bust a cap on somebody?
- I bust a cap like, blam-blam.

595
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,235
Damn! God!

596
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,589
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!

597
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,927
You say you want to wait till
you get married first, right?

598
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,641
No, look at me. Right?

599
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,062
Yes

600
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,234
and I say that I'm gonna be
the one who marries you.

601
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,113
So it don't make no difference
when we do it.

602
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,989
We still gonna get married, right?

603
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,943
Yeah, but I'm going to college
before I marry...

604
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,739
And there ain't no guarantee
that I'm gonna marry you!

605
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,294
Bad shit!

606
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,460
- Shit, look at this.
- Oh, shit.

607
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,596
Hey, hey, yo. Yo, bonita.

608
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,473
Damn, she got a banging ass.

609
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:20,803
Chica bonita. You come to my casa
and let's do the loco thing.

610
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,186
Hey, dooky, this fool trying
to speak Spanish...

611
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,314
- That shit worked.
- What up, baby?

612
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,694
So let me knock the stuffing
off that egg mcmuffin.

613
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,442
You got a phone number?

614
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,999
- You haven't even given me a ring!
- I ain't ready for all that yet!

615
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,668
But you're ready to act
like we are, though?

616
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,177
- With your mad self.
- Don't touch me.

617
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,560
All right.

618
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,703
- You make me sick, man.
- I know, but I missed you.

619
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,364
I missed you too.

620
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,199
I missed you too.

621
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,179
He still ain't fucked her yet.

622
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,016
You better take your ass
to the store with that

623
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,769
so you gonna give me
the skins or what?

624
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,113
No, that's not all I think about.

625
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,028
Yeah

626
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,741
okay, h, han o g on. Pop!

627
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,247
Brandi's mom say you're cute!

628
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,750
Ask her how come she don't say hi
when I speak to her.

629
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,121
==

630
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,418
Yeah

631
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,424
hey, I'm supposed to be talking
to you, not passing messages.

632
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:22,262
If my daddy mess with your mama,
we gonna be brother and sister.

633
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,932
Then we have to do
that incest thing.

634
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,432
What?

635
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:31,021
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.

636
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,940
Who this?

637
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,029
Oh, hi, mama.

638
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,155
Yeah. Hang on, I got Brandi
on the other line, okay?

639
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,578
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

640
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,456
Tre, this is your mother.

641
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,798
I'm sorry, mama.
Hang on for one second. Okay.

642
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,761
Brandi?
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

643
00:50:58,973 --> 00:50:59,973
Okay.

644
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,930
Hi, mama.

645
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,179
"Who this?"

646
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,845
What kind of way is that
to answer the phone?

647
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,805
I'm sorry, mama.

648
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,356
- Why didn't you come this weekend?
- I was cooling with Rick.

649
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,064
You can cool
with your friends anytime.

650
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,283
The weekends are supposed
to be our time together.

651
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,659
Have you thought about
what we talked about?

652
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,493
Yeah

653
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,453
and?

654
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,127
I don't know yet.

655
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,173
Let me speak to your daddy.

656
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,845
Pop!

657
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,464
Telephone!

658
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,517
Who this?

659
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,514
Hey, how you doing?

660
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,518
Yeah. Yeah, we talked about that.

661
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,525
Yeah, well, look...

662
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,529
I know you don't agree with me,
but I think it's his decision.

663
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,988
Look, I don't...
No, I don't think that's necessary.

664
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:07,662
Look, reva. Reva, this is bullshit.

665
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,409
I'm sorry, but I think it's ridiculous.

666
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,546
There's no reason for him
to come live with you now.

667
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,544
He's not a baby!

668
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,337
No

669
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,753
No, no, wait a minute.
Why you got an attitude?

670
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,222
I don't have an attitude.
You have an attitude!

671
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,222
We have gone through this
a thousand times. I always tell him...

672
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,895
Use a rubber!
You know, use a rubber...

673
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,640
Watch me shoot this motherfucker.

674
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:36,942
I ook.

675
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:40,525
Yeah

676
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:44,366
- taken off the motherfucking set.
- Hey, yo, monster, man.

677
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:48,446
Don't be cussing so motherfucking
loud. My moms don't like that shit.

678
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,575
Come on, man, move the plastic.
You're sitting on the good part.

679
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,084
Damn!

680
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,540
Darin?

681
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,457
See, now I gotta hear this shit.

682
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,959
Darin!

683
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,759
- What?
- Get them drive-by shooters out of...

684
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,926
Damn! Moms be fucking
with his ass without fail

685
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,094
she ain't like that with Rick, though.

686
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,471
Because they got different daddies.

687
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:19,102
Y'all got to get the fuck out.
My brother got company in a minute.

688
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:22,693
See that? I didn't get my turn.
“It's monster's fault

689
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,941
come on, man. Fix that shit, man.

690
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,622
What up, man?

691
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,495
What up, dude?

692
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,209
Who that?

693
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:08,655
Anybody know
where Ricky baker lives?

694
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,654
That's my brother! He live here.

695
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,160
Hey, yo, Rick!
The man here to see you!

696
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,825
Stop.

697
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,663
Stop. Hold still. Be still.

698
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:21,841
There, I got it.

699
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,632
Yo, Rick! Get your ass out of there.

700
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,678
Ricky, come on out
of the bathroom, baby.

701
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,469
Check this out.
Here come the reverend.

702
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,763
So, what college you from?

703
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,016
I'm from usc.

704
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,689
You got to have a scholarship
to go to so?

705
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,358
No, but it helps.

706
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,781
Can you hook me up
with a scholarship?

707
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,277
- What do you do?
- I used to play baseball.

708
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,032
Shut up, man.

709
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,707
Don't you know
the man's about business?

710
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,210
Move, nigga. Move, punk.

711
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,333
Move.

712
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,214
Y'all be the fuck quiet.

713
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,510
Hello.

714
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,302
I'm Lewis crump.
You must be Ricky's mother?

715
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,726
Brenda.

716
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,348
And this is my other son, Darin.

717
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,053
- Hello, Darin.
- What's up?

718
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,226
Can I get you something to drink”

719
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,732
- coffee, water, soda”
- No, thank you.

720
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,607
We met at the game
against Washington.

721
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:30,699
I remember. That was a good game.
You picked up 276 yards in that game.

722
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,526
That's impressive. Thanks.

723
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,237
Well, why don't y'all sit and talk?

724
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:37,952
Hey!

725
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:00,892
I want you to know, we're interested
in you coming to the campus.

726
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,646
Get a good look around, you know,
3 feel for the school as a whole.

727
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,149
Here's my tape.

728
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,498
That was against banning
my junior year.

729
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,996
Man, we lost that year,
but I did pretty well in yardage.

730
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,875
They had the best defence
in the city that year.

731
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,597
Big country Booty!
Big country titties!

732
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,300
- Boo-yal
- That's what I'm saying.

733
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,596
From eating all that corn bread
and shit, I guess.

734
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,643
Shit. Me, I go to college
just for the ho's.

735
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,686
You don't go there to talk to bitches.

736
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,151
You're supposed to be
learning something.

737
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,776
Can't learn shit,
talking to no stupid-ass bitch.

738
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,825
- Yo, check out that 808.
- Damn, that shit bumping.

739
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,829
What are you interested in
beside playing ball?

740
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,336
- Like, what you mean?
- I mean

741
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:14,511
what do you want to major in”? What
kind of degree would you pursue?

742
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,048
I'm just asking because
there's a strong possibility...

743
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,185
That you won't go into the NFL
after college.

744
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,679
Just a fact. It happens.

745
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,648
Yeah, I heard that before.

746
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,319
Actually, I was thinking
about majoring in business.

747
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:34,990
I got this friend, tre, who's always
talked about going into business.

748
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,693
Plus, I like computers.
Maybe I could do that.

749
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,737
What do you think?

750
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,828
Young brother, I think you can do
anything you put your mind to.

751
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,878
I tell you where y'all need to go.

752
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:56,341
Where they got more women
than anywhere. Fine ones too.

753
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,968
- Crenshaw on Sunday nights.
- No.

754
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,722
- Street races on Florence?
- No, nigga. Y'all way off.

755
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,227
I give y'all a hint.

756
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,389
Everybody's been there.

757
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,900
- Where?
- Where, nigga? Spit it out!

758
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,903
The church.

759
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,231
Oh, shit!

760
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:20,361
Nigga, please! Ain't nobody going
to church to catch no bitches:

761
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,573
I should roll your ass up off
this porch for that stupid shit.

762
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,211
So basically you have
923 overall gpa

763
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,505
according to the classes
we require.

764
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,090
All you have to do
is take the sat test.

765
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,088
Yeah

766
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,427
I heard about that test.

767
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,053
The next one's being offered,
let's see

768
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,885
early October.
Are you gonna take it?

769
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,938
I guess so. I can't get into
college without it, right?

770
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:52,101
Just remember, all you have
to do is get over a 700.

771
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,445
- Okay.
- Come here. Come here!

772
00:58:56,116 --> 00:59:00,075
I'm sorry, I'm trying to give
him a bath. Come here.

773
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,620
Your little brother?

774
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,282
No, that's my son.

775
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,622
Well, I'll look forward
to talking to you again.

776
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,337
We'll also arrange that tour for you.

777
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,176
Thank you, Mr. crump.

778
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,296
You bet, Ricky. Bye-bye.

779
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:29,646
You gonna give me a scholarship?
Because I want to go to college too.

780
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,808
- Man, shut the fuck up.
- Fuck you, nigga.

781
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,477
It's my porch.
You can take your dumb-ass home.

782
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,609
My baby is going to a university.

783
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,660
I always knew you would
amount to something.

784
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,324
I did.

785
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:50,167
When you were little, you used to
always run around with that football.

786
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,666
I'm proud of you, baby.

787
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,798
- Thanks, mama.
- You make your mama proud.

788
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,679
May I have your attention?

789
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,634
The sat test will be
administered in this room.

790
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:11,187
When you receive your test book,
please keep it closed on your desk.

791
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,521
Read the directions on the
front cover of your test book.

792
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,153
Use a number two pencil in
marking your answer sheet.

793
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,607
Ink or ballpoint pen
is not to be used.

794
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,694
If you do not have
a number two pencil with you...

795
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:30,374
Raise your hand and keep it up.
We'll pass a pencil out to you.

796
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:35,041
During the time allotted for a section,
you may work on that section only.

797
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,877
If you finish a section
before time is called

798
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,886
you may not go back to a previous
section or on to the next one.

799
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,722
You have 30 minutes
for section one.

800
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:49,556
Open your test books and begin work.

801
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,616
This it? Yeah

802
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,459
Damn!

803
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,465
Baby got more cakes
than Duncan hines!

804
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,971
Damn.

805
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,932
Bet you bite a chip.

806
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:17,314
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't
moved two percent in five years.

807
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,475
- "Furious styles financial.”
- Talk to you later.

808
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,984
So how you guys think
you did on the test?

809
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,820
All right, I guess.

810
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:39,377
Those tests are culturally biased.
The only universal part is the math.

811
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,754
You boys must be hungry.
I'm real surprised to see you.

812
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,960
Came to see you.

813
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,804
See how you doing.
How's business going?

814
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:54,055
Well, there's always business,
just not always in here.

815
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,514
What do you do, furious?

816
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,805
You help people get money
for homes or what?

817
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,188
Well, there is no "or what."
That's what I do, Rick.

818
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,404
- You boys want to see something?
- Do we have a choice?

819
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,287
No

820
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:58,244
I don't know about all this. Got us
walking around Compton and all.

821
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,076
Rick, it's the '90s.

822
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,337
We can't afford to be afraid
of our own people anymore.

823
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,134
Would you two knuckleheads
come on?

824
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:19,057
I want y'all to look at that sign.
See what it says?

825
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,890
"Cash for your home."
You know what that is?

826
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,983
It's a billboard. Billboard

827
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,985
what are y'all, Amos and Andy?

828
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,112
Are you steppin' and he's fetchit?

829
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,109
I'm talking about the message.
What it stands for.

830
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,948
It's called "gentrification.”

831
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:40,407
It's what happens when property value
of a certain area is brought down.

832
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:42,663
You listening? Yeah

833
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,667
they bring the property value down.
They can buy the land cheaper.

834
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,959
Then they move the people out,
raise the value and sell it at a profit.

835
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:56,424
What we need to do is keep
everything in our neighbourhood black.

836
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,391
Black-owned with black money.

837
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,437
Just like the Jews, the Italians,
the Mexicans and the Koreans do.

838
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:06,104
Ain't nobody from outside bringing
down the property value.

839
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,650
It's these folk!

840
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:12,439
Shooting each other and selling
that crack rock and shit

841
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,695
how you think crack
gets into the country?

842
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:18,787
We don't own any planes.
We don't own no ships.

843
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,832
We are not the people who are flying
and floating that shit in here.

844
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,045
Every time you turnona TV,
that's what you see.

845
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:31,166
Black people selling the rock,
pushing the rock. Yeah, I know.

846
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,010
It wasn't a problem
when it was here.

847
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,421
Wasn't a problem
until it was in Iowa.

848
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,846
And on wall street where
there's hardly any black people.

849
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,511
If you want to talk about guns...

850
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,931
Why is it that there's a gun shop
on every corner here?

851
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,437
- Why?
- I'll tell you why.

852
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:52,813
Same reason there's a liquor store on
every corner in the black community.

853
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,239
Why? They want us
to kill ourselves.

854
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,360
You go out to Beverly Hills,
you don't see that shit.

855
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,662
They want to us to kill ourselves.

856
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:05,493
The best way to destroy a people is to
take away their ability to reproduce.

857
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,171
Who is it that's dying out here on
these streets every night? Y'all.

858
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,841
- Yeah.
- Young brothers like yourselves.

859
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,508
What am I supposed to do?
Fool roll up, try to smoke me?

860
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,841
I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker
if he don't kill me first.

861
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,346
You doing exactly
what they want you to do.

862
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:27,021
You have to think, young brother,
about your future.

863
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,226
Damn, man.
You know, furious is deep.

864
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:36,069
- He used to be a preacher?
- He ain't never been no preacher.

865
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,070
Just reads a lot

866
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,074
my brother should've
heard that, man.

867
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,406
Would've done him some good.

868
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,741
Where he at?

869
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:50,746
Where else, man? Up on crenshaw
with the rest of them fools.

870
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,293
Let's go. Cool.

871
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,285
- What up, monster?
- What up, nigga?

872
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,655
Goddamn, there's a lot
of motherfuckers here.

873
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,622
Don't be using god's name in vain.

874
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,408
What?

875
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,788
Man, shut up.

876
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,291
Yo, man, you believe in god?

877
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:36,546
Yo, why the fuck y'all get
so damn religi-fied lately?

878
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,634
Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.

879
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:42,464
This is an a and b conversation.
You can see your way out of it.

880
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,800
You can see your way out
of my ride...

881
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,810
And we'll see your crippled ass
walking home.

882
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,556
Man, look. Do I believe in god?
Yeah, I guess I do.

883
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:55,276
How else can you have the sun,
moon and stars and shit like that?

884
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:59,982
Sun, moon, stars, quasars.
Motherfucker sound like elroy jetson.

885
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,816
There ain't no god.

886
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,580
If there was a god, why he be letting
motherfuckers get smoked?

887
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:12,127
- Babies and little kids, tell me that.
- You tell me this, nigga.

888
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,830
How you know god's a he? He could
be a she. You don't know that.

889
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,877
For one thing, you don't know what
the fuck I be motherfucking knowing.

890
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,340
I read about this shit
when I was in the pen.

891
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:26,512
It was this book, right,
and it was telling...

892
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,848
Llfe in the perspective
if god was a bitch

893
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:35,191
said if god was a bitch, there wouldn't
be no nuclear bombs, no wars...

894
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,359
Because that ain't
in a bitch's nature.

895
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:42,198
Why every time you talk about
a female you say "bitch" or "ho"?

896
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,867
- Because that's what you are.
- Nigga, fuck you.

897
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,995
Hey, hey.

898
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:56,208
What's up?

899
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,838
What up, d?

900
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:17,642
- What's up, mon?
- What's up, Rick? Tre.

901
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,855
What's happening?

902
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,361
- Where y'all coming from?
- Compton.

903
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,192
What y'all doing over here, man?

904
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:31,202
We're kicking it. Philosophising
on god, church, bitches and all.

905
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,917
I'm schooling these niggas
on the aspect of religion.

906
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:38,205
- Religion?
- And on factual, actual studies.

907
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,289
You know what I'm saying?

908
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,254
Y'all coming from Compton? Yeah

909
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,922
- thought you were scared of Compton.
- Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.

910
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:50,217
It was deep, though.
You should've been there, man.

911
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,769
Pops was talking, speaking, man.
Speaking the truth and shit.

912
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:58,270
Your pops is like
motherfucking Malcolm farrakhan.

913
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,455
Man, what's wrong with you?

914
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,122
Fuck you looking at, nigga”

915
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,954
I'm still trying to find out, nigga!

916
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:22,457
We got a problem here?

917
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,087
We got a problem here?
We got a problem, nigga?

918
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,012
- What up with this?
- Put the gun away.

919
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,929
Can't we have one night
where nobody gets shot?

920
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,803
- Shut up, bitch.
- Bitch, I will fuck you up!

921
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,140
Let's get that bitch!
Fuck you like that.

922
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,536
Ferris always trying
to start some shit

923
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:01,292
nigga can't fight, so he always trying
to find an excuse to shoot somebody.

924
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,294
That's why fools be getting
shot all the time.

925
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,048
Trying to show how hard they is.
Ignorant.

926
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:10,884
Fool, shut up.
You be doing that shit too.

927
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,173
I know.

928
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,072
Hey, man, come on. Let's go!

929
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,290
I'm getting the fuck out of L.A.

930
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,217
Fuck this shit. Fuck it.

931
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:52,551
You can't go nowhere without
it getting all shot up and shit.

932
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,184
Shit!

933
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,353
Shit! Fuck!

934
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:10,027
Driver! Put your hands
on the steering wheel!

935
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,840
- Got any drugs or weapons on you?
- No.

936
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:35,969
I didn't do nothing.

937
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,719
You think you tough.

938
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,638
You think you're tough, huh?

939
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,477
You scared now, huh?

940
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,865
I like that. That's why I took this job.

941
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:56,615
I hate little motherfuckers like you.

942
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,788
Little niggers, you ain't shit!
Think you tough, huh?

943
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:07,129
I could blow your head off,
and you couldn't do shit.

944
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,749
How you feel now?

945
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,676
What set you from?

946
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,923
Look like one of them
crenshaw mafia motherfuckers.

947
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,802
No, you probably one of them
rolling 60s, huh?

948
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,311
12-Adam-63, we have
a possible 187 in blue vw...

949
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,976

Florence and Vermont

950
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:35,484

atl corner of Florence and Vermont.

951
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:36,696
Stay out of trouble.

952
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,988
You gentlemen have
a nice evening now, you hear?

953
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,980
Hi

954
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:19,823
- I thought something happened to you.
- Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

955
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,365
I'm tired of hearing them
shooting all the time.

956
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,046
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

957
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,881
I'm tired of this shit.

958
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,471
Those two motherfuckers.

959
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,967
I could kill all these motherfuckers.

960
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,060
I'm sick and fucking tired
of this shit!

961
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:47,058
I'm fucking sick of this shit!

962
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,766
I'm so fucking tired of this shit!
Fuck this shit!

01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,608
Stupid motherfucker!
Fucking fuck you! Fuck you!

964
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:58,779
I wish I could kill all you!
Come on at me, motherfucker!

965
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,954
What's so funny?

966
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:51,953
I never thought I'd be crying
in front of a female.

967
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,632
You can cry in front of me.

968
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,621
What do you think about...

969
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,950
People getting married
while they're still in college?

970
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,162
Are you trying to ask me something?

971
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,791
No

972
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:40,172
I just wanted to know what you thought
about that kind of situation:

973
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:46,641
I think it can be good
if two people really love each other.

974
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,347
Really?

975
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,387
Yeah

976
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,234
you sure you're down for this?

977
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,816
Yeah. Are you?

978
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,192
Yeah

979
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:05,026
I mean, yes, I am.

980
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,708
I don't want to get pregnant.

981
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:14,744
You won't.

982
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,199
Hi. I'm looking for
9 miss devereaux?

983
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,876
- She's right over there.
- Thank you.

984
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,388
Hey. “Hi

985
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,393
you look nice.

986
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,688
Thank you. So do you.

987
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,106
Thanks.

988
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,808
Thanks for coming.

989
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,102
So

990
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:24,063
So this is.

991
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,114
Definitely you.

992
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,907
And what's that supposed to mean?

993
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,997
I thought we were
gonna talk about tre.

994
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:37,960
Espresso, please.

995
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,920
Cafe au lait, please.

996
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,713
I bought him some shoes yesterday.

997
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,466
Why are you always
buying him stuff?

998
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,340
Can't I be nice to my son?
Do I have that right?

999
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:55,512
Yes, but he has a job. You don't
have to always buy him stuff.

1000
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,020
I ook

1001
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,974
did he tell you he wants
to move in with Brandi?

1002
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,142
Yeah so?

1003
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,978
"Yeah so?"

1004
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,236
So don't you think that's a bad idea?

1005
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:17,492
I think that tre is old enough
to make his own decisions, reva.

1006
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:22,664
You're his father. That means you
were supposed to guide his decisions.

1007
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,340
What have I been doing
for the last seven years?

1008
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,253
- Not that, evidently.
- Listen, reva...

1009
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,969
It's time for you to let go.
I know you want to play the mommy...

1010
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,019
But tre is a grown man now.
He's not a little boy anymore.

1011
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,352
That time has passed, sweetheart.
You missed it

1012
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,268
excuse me,
I'm getting some cigarettes.

1013
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,070
You're not getting off that easy.
Sit your ass down.

1014
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,027
Fxcuse me?

1015
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:54,203
I said sit down before I raise my voice
and make a fool out of both of us.

1016
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,659
Okay.

1017
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:03,705
Now it's my time to talk.

1018
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:07,675
Of course you took in
your son, my son...

1019
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,547
Our son...

1020
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,842
And you taught him to be a man.
I'll give you that...

1021
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,800
Pecause most men ain't man enough
to do what you did.

1022
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:21,397
But that gives you no reason,
do you hear me, no reason...

1023
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,438
To tell me that I can't be
a mother to my son.

1024
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,187
What you did...

1025
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:33,739
Is no different from what mothers
have done from the beginning of time.

1026
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,325
It's just too bad
more brothers won't do the same.

1027
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,744
But don't think you're special.

1028
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:44,378
You may be cute, but not special.

1029
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,129
Drink your café au lait. It's on me.

1030
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:57,929
Everybody in the mall was running.
Bitches running out of contempo's.

1031
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,725
Niggas was getting their bail on.

1032
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,063
I was smoking every motherfucker
that came in.

1033
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,987
I thought I'd let y'all know that.
Understands me?

1034
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,282
What's up?

1035
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,614
You missing all the action.
Niggas getting smoked and shit.

1036
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:26,958
Who's them niggas?

1037
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,123
Man, pick Chris up.

1038
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,632
Punk might start trippin'.

1039
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:36,594
That's those fools from crenshaw.
Damn, I ain't even got my gat.

1040
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,442
Motherfucker ain't got
nothing better to do.

1041
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:51,903
Twenty-seven years old.
Still fucking motherfuckers our age...

1042
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,943
With his old ass.

1043
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,278
What's up?

1044
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:56,859
Anyway...

1045
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:01,288
I saw you roll out of Brandi crib
at 2 in the motherfucking morning.

1046
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,954
Yo, man, that's my business.

1047
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,251
Yeah. Handle your shit, g.

1048
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,962
- Peer pressure, man.
- Handle your shit.

1049
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,165
Don't be like this motherfucker.

1050
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:15,420
This motherfucker got babies,
in-house pussy.

1051
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,755
Let me do shit like that,
ma would be like:

1052
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,506
"I ain't having it."

1053
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:21,933
Ricky.

1054
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,014
Ricky!

1055
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,267
You know you heard me.

1056
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,015
What?

1057
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,268
I need you to go get some cornmeal.

1058
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:32,732
Yeah. I'll go in a little while.

1059
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:39,990
You wanna land a good job, you have
to know what most employers want.

1060
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:44,244
Like how to motivate yourself.
How to lead others.

1061
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,708
How to perform under pressure.

1062
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:51,626
Learn these things in the army.
No matter what career you choose...

1063
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:55,672
You'll really be ready to take off.

1064
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,009
Ricky, get up and go now.

1065
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,591
I can't finish frying the fish without it.

1066
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:05,936
Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal.

1067
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,565
You ought to be happy
somebody's cooking for your ass.

1068
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,355
- Give me some, dook.
- Here, take it.

1069
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,061
- What's up?
- What's happening?

1070
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,939
D, go to the store for me
and get some cornmeal?

1071
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,243
Nigga, I ain't the one she told
to go get it. She's your wife.

1072
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,203
She ain't my wife, man.

1073
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:24,867
Shit.

1074
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,582
Might as well be,
y'all got a family and shit.

1075
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,498
"Tecmo bowl" playing motherfucker.

1076
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,792
Fuck you, man.
Go to the store with me.

1077
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,293
Sure, let's do it.

1078
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,586
What?

1079
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,591
Don't fuck me, fuck your wife.
That's why you got a baby.

1080
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,009
You better get out
of my face, all right?

1081
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,470
What's up with Brandi?

1082
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:47,845
- Hey, you a punk, man!
- Hey, yo, yo. Wait a minute.

1083
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,058
Wait a minute!

1084
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,474
This is family business.
Let them fight.

1085
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,727
Y'all are brothers!
You ain't supposed to be fighting.

1086
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:57,274
You been a punk from day one.
Mama's boy!

1087
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,069
Get him, dough.

1088
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,825
Let them fight, man.

1089
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,658
Brenda, Ricky and doughboy
are out here fighting.

1090
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,699
Hey, hey. Cut that out.
Get off of him.

1091
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:10,875
(Set off of him!

1092
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,623
Damn.

1093
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:14,913
- What you hit me for?
- You all right?

1094
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,837
Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right!

1095
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:25,599
What you hit me for?

1096
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,093
It's the test scores. Ricky!

1097
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,971
Ricky, baby, your test scores!

1098
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,056
What you hit me for?

1099
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,772
Why you hitting me?

1100
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:38,938
Yo, dough. Why she hit you?

1101
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,814
Shut up, man.

1102
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:44,360
Fuck all that shit.
I'm going into the fucking army.

1103
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,454
- That's all there is to say.
- You're doing what?

1104
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,577
Man, what are you, a damn fool?

1105
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:52,284
They say I can learn
to work on computers.

1106
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,958
Plus, they'll give me
money for college.

1107
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,254
Listen to you.
You sound like the commercial.

1108
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,503
They don't tell you that
you don't belong to you no more.

1109
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:05,801
You belong to them,
the government.

1110
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:08,134
Like a slave or something.

1111
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,602
My daddy told me a black man...

1112
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,977
Nas got no business, no place
in the white man's army.

1113
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,020
I heard all that.

1114
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,147
I got a little boy to think about, okay?

1115
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:22,273
I don't want to be like my brother.
Hanging out and not doing shit.

1116
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:24,778
End up dealing 'caine, just like him.

1117
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:29,200
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

1118
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,619
Listen, let me tell you something.

1119
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,619
When you join that army,
you ain't gonna be nobody.

1120
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,462
Yo, you got any change”?

1121
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,756
No, I ain't got no change. See?

1122
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:45,838
What up?

1123
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,183
Yo, chief. Here you go.

1124
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,107
Hey, no problem, bro.

1125
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:02,528
You win anything?

1126
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,487
Wait a minute, man.
I'm still trying to find out.

1127
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,952
Shit. Nothing.

1128
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,748
- What?
- I said nothing. I didn't win.

1129
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,999
You gotta be Mexican
to win that shit.

1130
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:23,341
Man, I win this lottery, I won't
have to worry about a damn thing.

1131
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:28,593
Don't have to worry about no colleges,
no 700 on no sats. Not a damn...

1132
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,094
I ook.

1133
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,805
There's that motherfucker
from the other night.

1134
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:42,068
Okay. When I say "cut,"
we'll cut through these houses.

1135
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,859
Cut!

1136
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,242
- Punk ass.
- Get him, man, get him!

1137
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:50,531
Let's get him.

1138
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,413
Go around the corner.
Cut them off. Come on, go!

1139
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,120
Shit.

1140
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,038
Fucking mangy mutts!

1141
01:26:58,255 --> 01:26:59,290
Come on.

1142
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,125
I got you. I got you.

1143
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,878
- Come on, let's go.
- Hold on, man.

1144
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,552
- What are you doing?
- I gotta drain the weasel.

1145
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:15,929
If that motherfucker roll up on the set
one more time, I'll blast his ass.

1146
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,191
Shit! Rick!

1147
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,154
What a relief and shit.

1148
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,775
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Let's split up.

1149
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,826
I don't think we should do that.

1150
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,947
I think it'd be better
if we're together.

1151
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:39,451
Them fools ain't gonna do nothing.
They just showing out and shit.

1152
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,506
I'll meet you at your house.
Cool. I'm out of here.

1153
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,590
Come on, man.

1154
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,582
Ricky!

1155
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,872
Ricky.

1156
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,920
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!

1157
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,214
Ricky!

1158
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,094
Shit!

1159
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,902
Watch his head. Don't hurt him.

1160
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:40,451
Don't hurt him, man.

1161
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,660
Be careful with him.

1162
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,057
Watch his head.

1163
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,934
He's dead.

1164
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,268
I et's take him home.

1165
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,135
Mama!

1166
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,176
Mama!

1167
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,893
Mama!

1168
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,309
No!

1169
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:58,158
Ricky! Oh, my god, no!
Not Ricky!

1170
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,821
What y'all doing now?

1171
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:05,324
Ricky?

1172
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,412
Oh, my god.

1173
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,039
Ricky? Ricky, baby, get up.

1174
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:16,627
Get up. Wake up, baby.

1175
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,174
Ricky, get up. Get up.

1176
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:20,680
It's all right. Get up, baby.

1177
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:22,219
Get up. Tre, what happened?

1178
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,267
What happened to him?

1179
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,679
Give me the baby.
Give me the baby!

1180
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:30,603
Don't touch him!
Don't you ever touch him!

1181
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,272
He don't need to be seeing this!

1182
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,979
Ricky, please wake up!

1183
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:38,698
Mom.

1184
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:42,410
- What did you do”? What did you do?
- It wasn't my fault.

1185
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,246
- What did you do?
- Mama, I didn't do nothing.

1186
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:48,204
I didn't do nothing.
I didn't do nothing.

1187
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:50,994
Oh, my god!
What did you do to him?

1188
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,417
What did you do?

1189
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:58,510
What did you do”? You did this!
You did this! I'll kill you!

1190
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:03,887
You did it! I know you did it!
You did it! Yes, you did!

1191
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:12,895
I told youl!

1192
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:20,152
Oh, god! Oh, god!

1193
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,983
Oh, my god!

1194
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:24,827
Ricky, baby! Ricky!

1195
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:28,949
Meet me at my house
in five minutes.

1196
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,503
Tre, what happened?

1197
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,472
- Talk to me. What happened?
- Go home.

1198
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:46,675
- What happened to Ricky?
- Go home.

1199
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,807
Talk to him.
Something happened to Rick!

1200
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:53,106
I don't know. He just got shot.
Something happened to Rick!

1201
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,978
Brandi, I want you to calm down and
I want you to go home. You hear me?

1202
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,446
You hear me? Yes

1203
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:06,699
I'll take care of him.
He'll be all right.

1204
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,532
Tre?

1205
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,870
Tre, what are you doing?

1206
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:27,132
Oh, you bad, now, huh?

1207
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,469
You bad. You gotta shoot
somebody now, huh?

1208
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:33,392
Well, here I am.

1209
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:35,811
Come on, shoot me.

1210
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,853
You bad, right?

1211
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,116
Look, I'm sorry about your friend.

1212
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:50,076
My heart goes out to his family,
but that's their problem.

1213
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,790
You my son. You my problem.

1214
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,961
I want you to give me the gun.

1215
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:06,004
I see. You want to end up
like little Chris in a wheelchair?

1216
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:10,851
Right? No, no, you want to end up
like doughboy, huh? No?

1217
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:14,930
Give me the motherfucking gun, tre!

1218
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:42,002
You're my only son, and I'm not gonna
lose you to no bullshit, you hear?

1219
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,210
I love you, man.

1220
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,098
Go clean yourself up.

1221
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:02,439
(0 on.

1222
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:40,310
Tre

1223
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:42,270

1224
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,608
Damn.

1225
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:55,321
Shit!

1226
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:36,738
Yeah

1227
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:51,381

1228
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,347
Dough...

1229
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,058
Let me out.

1230
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:59,287
Where these motherfuckers at, man?
Been out here damn near three hours.

1231
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,373
It's colder than a motherfucker
out here too.

1232
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:04,625
Let's go eat.

1233
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:06,745
Cool.

1234
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:15,717
When you gonna get your hair cut?
It look like something from 1983.

1235
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:17,588
Ain't nobody cutting my hair.

1236
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,175
I'm like Samson.
My strength is in my head.

1237
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,261
What's up with the babe
you been talking to?

1238
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:25,138
Fuck that bitch. You scared?

1239
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,483
- He ain't scared, he just young.
- And dumb.

1240
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,901
I'm putting ketchup on this.

1241
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,816
Why vou put all that ketchup on it?

1242
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:36,365
Why you worried about it, fool?
These my fries.

1243
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:43,285
We going to see your girl?

1244
01:38:43,543 --> 01:38:45,784
No, I'm going to see my girl.
You going home.

1245
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:48,036
There they go, right there.

1246
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,334
Turn off the lights.

1247
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,836
Hit the lights, nigga.

1248
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,380
Take your ass home
and watch some videos.

1249
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:57,299
Home with your mama.

1250
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:05,557
Check that motherfucker out.

1251
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:11,188
- Shit!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

1252
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:13,686
Don't follow me. Go your own way.

1253
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:28,751
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck you doing?

1254
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:31,542
This motherfucker's crazy!

1255
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:35,212
Goddamn, man. And I'm on parole.
Ain't this about a bitch!

1256
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,880
What the fuck you doing?

1257
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,212
Shit!

1258
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:41,639
Yo, dough. Let's bail, man.

1259
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:43,804
- Let's go, man!
- Come on, nigga, now!

1260
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:47,303
Man, what the fuck?

1261
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:50,727
Oh, shit!

1262
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:54,352
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, man. Let's go!

1263
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:01,859
Fuck you, man!

1264
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:03,952
Fuck you!

1265
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:08,033
Turn your punk ass over.

1266
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:18,005
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't pull the fucking trigger.

1267
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,635
What the fuck you doing?

1268
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:22,513
Come on, man.

1269
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,010
Well, fuck you!

1270
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:30,638
Dough, let's bail, man.

1271
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:32,098
Man, let's move!

1272
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,183
- Let's go!
- What the fuck you doing?

1273
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,735
- Let's bail, man!
- Let's go, man!

1274
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,196
Come on, nigga, let's bail!

1275
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:43,151
Damn! Come on!

1276
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:46,704
Shit, let's get out of here.

1277
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,202
Here come the fucking police.

1278
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:52,327
Get your ass in.

1279
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:55,079
Let's get the fuck up out of here.

1280
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:28,949
What's up?

1281
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:30,401
What's up?

1282
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,661
Yo, coz.

1283
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:41,086
I know why you got
out of the car last night.

1284
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:45,212
You shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

1285
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,753
You don't want that shit
to come back to haunt you.

1286
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:57,311
I ain't been up this early
in a long time.

1287
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,897
Turned on the TV this morning.

1288
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:08,565
Had this shit on about

1289
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:13,153
about living in a violent world.

1290
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,994
Showed all these foreign places.

1291
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:21,664
How foreigners live and all.

1292
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:26,298
I started thinking, man.

1293
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,087
Either they don't know...

1294
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,219
Don't show

1295
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:39,220
or don't care about
what's going on in the 'hood.

1296
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,860
They had all this foreign shit.

1297
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,235
They didn't have shit
on my brother, man.

1298
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:01,959
I ain't got no brother.

1299
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:16,765
Got no mother, neither.

1300
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:23,230
She loved that fool
more than she love me.

1301
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:25,228
Doughboy.

1302
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,977
You got some blow? Got some rock?

1303
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,321
Get the fuck out of my face!

1304
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:35,743
Keep them goddamn babies
out the street.

1305
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,369
Did y'all get them?

1306
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:56,380
I don't even know
how I feel about it neither, man.

1307
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:01,389
Shit just goes on and on, you know.

1308
01:46:03,691 --> 01:46:06,808
Next thing you know,
somebody might try to smoke me.

1309
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,063
Don't matter, though.

1310
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:18,068
We all gotta go sometime, huh?

1311
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:26,620
Seem like they punched
the wrong clock on Rick, though.

1312
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:31,419
Yeah

1313
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:35,594
I gotta go, coz.

1314
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,219
Hey, dough.

1315
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,806
What's up?

1316
01:46:50,696 --> 01:46:52,812
You still got one brother left, man.

1317
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:56,030
Thanks, man.

1318
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,199
- Later, g.
- I ater.
