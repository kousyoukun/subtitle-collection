1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,084
Hey, man, fuck that!

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:07,588
Them niggas around the corner
tripped out, man.

3
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:10,925
-Fuck that shit, man!
-Let's go. I'll take my car.

4
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:14,386
Oh, fuck that. We should've
let these niggas have it.

5
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:18,098
-Just pull up, just pull up.
-Get your shit ready, nigga.

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,475
Damn!

7
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:21,602
These niggas here?

8
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,313
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.

9
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:29,276
Look out, nigga! What's up, punk?!

10
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,871
Possible 187 at corner of
Crenshaw and Century.

11
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,125
They shot my brother!

12
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,779
-Tre, you do your homework?
-What homework?

13
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,990
-Yeah, I did it.
-Can I copy it?

14
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:19,159
Hell, no. Too bad,
you should've done it.

15
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:23,455
-Did you hear the shooting last night?
-Yeah, I got under my bed.

16
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,332
Man, you a scaredy-cat.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,794
My mama say, "A bullet
don't have no name on it."

18
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,298
I ain't afraid. My brothers
been shot and they still alive.

19
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,174
They lucky.

20
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:37,845
Y'all want to see something?

21
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:39,972
What?

22
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:42,558
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?

23
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,858
Is that blood?

24
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,234
What happened?

25
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:38,113
Somebody got smoked.
Look at the hole in the wall, stupid.

26
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,408
Least I can tell my times tables.

27
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,244
Look! Why is the blood
turning yellow?

28
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,748
That's what happens when it
separates from the plasma.

29
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,418
So that's how the settlers
survived that long hard winter...

30
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:55,464
...that took so many of their lives,
is by eating foods...

31
00:02:55,715 --> 00:03:00,844
...that were given to them,
like the turkey and the squash...

32
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:06,266
...and all the foods that we think of
as our traditional holiday meal.

33
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:09,937
And that's why we celebrate
Thanksgiving...

34
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,148
...to commemorate the unity
between the lndians--

35
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:15,109
Excuse me...

36
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,403
...the Native Americans.

37
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:22,282
--and the early English settlers
who were called.... Class?

38
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,284
Pilgrims.

39
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:26,787
That's right, the Pilgrims.
Very good.

40
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,288
The penguins!

41
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,959
Who said that?

42
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:35,504
-Mr. Styles.
-That's me.

43
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,590
How is it you always have
something funny to say?

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,509
Because I'm a comedian.

45
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,139
Would you like to come up
and teach the class?

46
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,517
Yeah, I can do that.

47
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,395
Very well, come on up. lnstruct us.

48
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:01,321
-What's the basis of your lecture?
-What?

49
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,991
What are you going to talk about?

50
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,452
I'd tell you if you let me talk.

51
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,002
-What's the name of this place?
-That's Africa. I know that.

52
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,670
Right, that's Africa.

53
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:20,674
Did you know that Africa is where
the body of the first man was found?

54
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,719
My daddy says that's where
all people originated from.

55
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:27,222
That means everybody's really
from Africa. Everybody.

56
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:29,725
All y'all. Everybody.

57
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:33,061
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from Crenshaw Mafia!

58
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,317
Like it or not, you from Africa.

59
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:42,821
I ain't from Africa. You from Africa.
You African booty-scratcher!

60
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,032
Quiet.

61
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,867
Punk, I'll kick your ass.

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,745
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.

63
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,705
I'll get my brother to shoot you!

64
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:55,876
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy. Least I got one.

65
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:59,046
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!

66
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:02,716
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now! That's enough!

67
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:10,599
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.

68
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:12,726
It's just that....

69
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,394
Yes, go on.

70
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:17,856
It's just that he has
a very bad temper.

71
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:22,569
It's extremely difficult for him
to interact with the other children.

72
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,240
Perhaps I could recommend therapy
or a child psychologist.

73
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:29,076
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.

74
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:33,372
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?

75
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,083
That's none of your business...

76
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:39,419
...but I am employed, and I'm studying
for my master's degree.

77
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,590
-Then you are educated.
-We gonna talk about me or my son?

78
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,425
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:49,763
Well, we'll be happy to see Tre
back in class on Tuesday.

80
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,766
His suspension was only
for three days, you know.

81
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:56,603
-No. You won't be seeing Tre again.
-And why is that, may I ask?

82
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:00,732
-Tre is going to live with his father.
-His father?

83
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:06,113
Yes, his father. Or did you think
we made babies by ourselves?

84
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:11,952
-You tell her go jump in the lake?
-What was our agreement?

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,454
What did we put down in writing?

86
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:21,753
"I, Tre Styles,
being of sound mind and body...

87
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:25,090
...agree not to get into any disputes,
physical or verbal...

88
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,469
...for the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this...

89
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:34,808
...I will go to live with my father,
Mr. Furious Styles."

90
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:38,312
"Signed...."
Oh, now, who wrote this?

91
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,608
"Tre Styles."

92
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,988
You have to work on
your handwriting.

93
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:03,462
Bean pies. World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?

94
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:09,718
I just don't want to
see you end up dead.

95
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,511
Or in jail.

96
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,183
A drunk, standing in front
of one of these liquor stores.

97
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,601
Can you understand?

98
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:24,524
Look at me. I'm serious.

99
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,986
I love you.

100
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:29,529
You're my only son.

101
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:05,691
How you doing?

102
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:10,195
-I'm fine. How about yourself?
-I'm living. That's enough for me.

103
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:14,741
Well, here he is.

104
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,542
-What's the matter? You can't say hi?
-Hi, Daddy.

105
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:28,088
Go ahead, talk to your friends.

106
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:38,765
-What's up, Tre?
-What's up, Doughboy?

107
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,103
Well, there goes your son.

108
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,942
You wanted him, you got him.

109
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:53,321
Why you trying to make this
so easy?

110
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:56,742
Well, it's like you told me:

111
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,454
I can't teach him how to be a man.

112
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:03,331
That's your job.

113
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,795
So it ain't no weekly thing
no more, huh?

114
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,630
You staying for good?

115
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,760
Chris, you know Tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?

116
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:18,221
Yeah. You the one collect
all those comic books.

117
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:20,015
You living here now?

118
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,811
Thank you, Reva.

119
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,522
Furious.

120
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:34,446
-Take care of my baby.
-He is my baby too.

121
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,657
You still collect comics?

122
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:41,828
This fool got more comics
than a motherfucker.

123
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:45,040
-Tre, come here.
-Watch my stuff.

124
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:50,337
What up, Tre?

125
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,172
What's up, Rick?

126
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:57,803
Well, it looks like you got
all your friends over here.

127
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:02,349
When you coming to pick me up?

128
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,645
Listen...

129
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,689
...this is just a temporary thing.

130
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,860
When I get out of school, I'll get
a better job, a better place to stay.

131
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,196
Maybe a house?

132
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:20,408
Then you can come back,
and things will be better. Okay?

133
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,369
Okay, Mom.

134
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,539
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

135
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:31,169
-Love you, love you.
-Me too. Bye, Mommy.

136
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,840
-Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
-I ain't got no troubles.

137
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,217
-You got some troubles?
-Lawn trouble.

138
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:40,053
-Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
-How much?

139
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:43,431
I'll give you $5
for the whole lawn.

140
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,852
Five dollars. Man, that ain't shit.

141
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:50,730
-I can make more doing nothing.
-Oh, yeah? Doing what?

142
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,691
He work for his uncle.

143
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,570
That's too bad. I guess I just
have to get my son to do it for me.

144
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:57,946
Do what?

145
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,949
Want you to rake up these leaves
off the lawn.

146
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,954
Boy, don't look at me funny if I
ask you to do something. Take this.

147
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,419
There's two trash bags right there
on the ground. See y'all later.

148
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:20,218
Damn, your daddy mean. He's worse
than the bogeyman himself.

149
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:24,347
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, Kunta Kinte?

150
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:27,058
-Later, Tre.
-Later.

151
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:31,271
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.

152
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,148
Shut up, fool. Yeah, there is.

153
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:36,234
If there is, I'll bet you Hulk
could whip his ass.

154
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,155
Yeah, later.

155
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,235
Tre, I gotta lay down
the rules of the house.

156
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,153
Same thing as weekends,
you remember?

157
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:24,991
All right, what are they?

158
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,287
Clean the bathroom sink,
floor and tub.

159
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,331
I gotta clean that tub?

160
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,707
Yeah.

161
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:39,005
Clean my room and water the lawn.

162
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,133
Dad, can I ask you something?

163
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,844
What do you have to do
around here?

164
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:54,020
I don't have to do nothing around here
except for pay the bills...

165
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,441
...put food on the table and put clothes
on your back, you understand?

166
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:01,069
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.

167
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,865
You may think I'm being hard
on you right now, but I'm not.

168
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:09,244
I'm trying to teach you
how to be responsible.

169
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:14,207
Your friends across the street,
they don't have anybody to show them.

170
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,710
You gonna see how they end up too.

171
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:23,842
I'm glad you're here, Tre.

172
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,178
You're a prince, you know that?

173
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,472
Yeah. You're the prince...

174
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,558
...I'm the king.

175
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:36,521
Right now, the king says it's time
for the prince to go to bed.

176
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,190
So get yourself together.

177
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,568
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

178
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:48,927
Oh, shit!

179
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:28,341
Somebody must've prayed
for that fool.

180
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:32,512
-I swear I aimed right for his head.
-Should've blew it off.

181
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,013
Don't say that.

182
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,308
Don't say that.

183
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:41,646
It'd be contributing to killing
another brother.

184
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,030
Man, where are these fools?

185
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,494
We've been waiting out here
for almost an hour.

186
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:19,684
-We got a call of a burglary here.
-That was about an hour ago.

187
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,395
We didn't ask you that.

188
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,147
Yeah, well, I told you.

189
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:27,233
Besides, I don't like having
my son out in the cold.

190
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,736
Just tell me what happened, sir.

191
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,571
Somebody broke into the house.

192
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,657
I fired at him with my piece,
and he ran away.

193
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:39,412
-You didn't get him?
-If I did, he'd be laid out here.

194
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:42,457
-Is there anything missing?
-No.

195
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,251
Good, no need to make out a report.

196
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:48,755
--got a 415 on Florence
between Vermont and Normandie.

197
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:52,926
Too bad you didn't get him.

198
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,721
Be one less nigger out here
we have to worry about.

199
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,230
Hey, little man, how you doing?

200
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:08,441
Go on in the house, Tre. Go on.

201
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:16,115
-Something wrong?
-Something wrong? Yeah.

202
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,954
It's just too bad
you don't know what it is...

203
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,500
...brother.

204
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:40,014
Ice cream man!

205
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:41,808
Wait up!

206
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:56,364
-What's up, Tre?
-What's up?

207
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:02,662
You ain't shit.

208
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,455
You just like your daddy.

209
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:07,959
You don't do shit and you
never gonna amount to shit.

210
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:12,255
All you ever do around here
is eat, sleep and shit.

211
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:16,634
Look at this place. Way y'all act,
y'all must think I'm the maid.

212
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,804
-Is that it? I gotta go.
-Hell, no, it ain't it!

213
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,849
It ain't it till I say it's it, damn it!

214
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,477
Cigarette.

215
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,649
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock
your ass in the middle of next week.

216
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:37,780
Where you going, you little fat fuck?
You ain't got a job.

217
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,409
Who's that little fucker
on my porch?

218
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:52,170
Oh, you're Furious' little boy, huh?

219
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:56,424
Boy, you look more and more
like your daddy every day.

220
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:57,884
So tell me something.

221
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,887
How come he don't play cards
with us no more?

222
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,388
I don't know.

223
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,600
I know he don't think
he's better than us.

224
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:07,894
Too busy shooting at people.

225
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,605
I heard what happened there
the other night.

226
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,235
He still got that same girlfriend?

227
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,945
Excuse me, Mama.

228
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:24,869
-Why do you always play football?
-Because that's what I'm gonna do.

229
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,454
That's right.

230
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,420
I heard Furious shot
at somebody last night.

231
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,464
-He get him?
-No.

232
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:42,095
Who is that?

233
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,264
That's my lady, homey.
Her name's Brandi.

234
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,934
She ain't your woman.
She's my woman.

235
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,478
-How, when she my lady?
-She's my wife.

236
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:54,607
I stick my ding-a-ling in her
every night, so that makes her mine.

237
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:58,403
Get your ass in here and quit
looking at them boys!

238
00:19:58,612 --> 00:19:59,862
Punk!

239
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:01,739
Faggot!

240
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:05,660
Get off me, with your big
4-by-4 head! Get off!

241
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:07,578
Get off!

242
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:12,083
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.

243
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:15,169
-Where's my ball?
-Man, don't bring that ball.

244
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,384
Me and my daddy going fishing.

245
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,261
We ain't gonna stay long.

246
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,514
-Where's he live?
-He don't live far.

247
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:34,897
Rick, why you have to bring that ball?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.

248
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,651
Y'all want to see a dead body?

249
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,529
Yeah.

250
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:44,949
Tre's daddy blasted
at somebody last night.

251
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,785
Really? What kind of gun
your daddy got?

252
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,456
I think it's a .357 Magnum.

253
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,666
Really? I got a deuce-deuce.

254
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,627
My brother gave it to me
before he went to jail.

255
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:00,715
I got it under my bed. Want to see?
It's loaded too.

256
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,932
It's up in here.

257
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:23,237
Damn!

258
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,365
It smell like a dog died.

259
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,330
-Look like Freddy Krueger got him.
-He stink.

260
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,041
That's how they smell after a while.

261
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:38,503
I wonder why it take them people
so long to pick him up.

262
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,882
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.

263
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,553
-Oh, man.
-Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!

264
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:50,723
-Hey, throw the ball.
-You ain't gonna see it again.

265
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:54,352
Don't you know this is a dead body?

266
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:56,479
Yeah, I know that shit!

267
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,190
He ain't bothering you,
so don't fuck with him!

268
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,235
Throw the ball, little man.

269
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:04,487
I ain't gonna take it.

270
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,073
Chris, tell him I ain't
gonna take his ball.

271
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:11,077
I got enough money to buy me
a hundred balls. Shit!

272
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,249
Man, I told you not to bring that ball.

273
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:23,923
Thanks, coz.

274
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:25,591
Yo, dog.

275
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:27,802
Throw the ball.

276
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:31,764
Shit.

277
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:33,933
Let's start the game, man.

278
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,022
Man, you stupid!
Don't have no sense.

279
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:43,317
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell Mama.

280
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,903
Man, shut up. I don't care.
Tell Mama.

281
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:49,615
Y'all leaving?

282
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,243
Hell, no.

283
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,287
Give me my brother's ball back!

284
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,832
-No, no!
-Come on, man!

285
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,919
No, don't say nothing.
They're just playing.

286
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:06,799
-Give me my brother's ball back!
-What'd you say, fat boy?

287
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,844
-Give me my brother's ball back be--
-Before what?

288
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:12,763
What your fat ass gonna do?

289
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:21,355
Yo, Rock! Give the little nigga
the ball back.

290
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,820
Stupid motherfucker!

291
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:30,489
I was gonna give it to you too.

292
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,003
Man!

293
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,012
Hey, man, I got a football.

294
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:55,306
I never use it myself.

295
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:59,685
-I give it to you when we get home.
-He ain't gonna want it.

296
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:02,355
His daddy gave him that ball.

297
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:05,316
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.

298
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,502
Yo, Rock, give me the ball.

299
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,754
Give me the fucking ball!

300
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:32,218
Hey!

301
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:34,220
Hey, little man!

302
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:38,891
Catch!

303
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,522
Man, you sorry.

304
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,696
-I'm going to the store.
-Why? You ain't got no money.

305
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,906
I'm going anyway.

306
00:24:57,744 --> 00:25:01,872
-So you a leader or a follower?
-I'm a leader.

307
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:05,209
Okay, then. What's the three rules?

308
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,586
Break it down for me. And, hey...

309
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:10,089
-...think before you answer.
-I got it!

310
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:15,970
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.

311
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:20,307
Two was to never be afraid
to ask you for anything.

312
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:22,435
Stealing isn't necessary.

313
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,187
And the last one, I think, was...

314
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,524
...to never respect anybody
who doesn't respect you back.

315
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:30,276
That right?

316
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:33,904
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

317
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,957
What do you know about sex?

318
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,796
-I know a little bit.
-Oh, yeah? What little bit is that?

319
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,549
I know, I take a girl...

320
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,968
...stick my thing in her...

321
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:58,929
...and nine months later
a baby comes out.

322
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,560
You think that's it?

323
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,812
Basically, yeah.

324
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:12,693
Well, remember this:

325
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:17,823
Any fool with a dick can make a baby,
but only a real man can raise his kids.

326
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,248
I wasn't but 17 when your mother
was pregnant with you.

327
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,337
All of my friends was dropping out
of high school...

328
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,008
...hanging out in front of liquor stores,
getting drunk, getting high.

329
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,305
Some of them was robbing people.

330
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,766
Some of them was
even killing people.

331
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:47,520
Hey, you remember
my friend Marcus?

332
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:52,525
He got into robbing people,
wanted me to join him...

333
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,945
...but I said,
"No, I'm getting ready to have a son."

334
00:26:57,614 --> 00:26:59,031
I knew you'd be a boy.

335
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:06,705
I wanted to be somebody
you could look up to.

336
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:10,626
So I guess that's why
I went to Vietnam.

337
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:12,545
Don't ever go in the Army, Tre.

338
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,881
Black man ain't got no place
in the Army.

339
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:21,053
Damn!

340
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:28,519
Why'd you get it all over me?

341
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,147
-Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
-What?

342
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:35,234
Oh, wait! Listen to this song!
I love this song!

343
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:50,749
Oh, damn!

344
00:27:52,294 --> 00:27:54,044
Looks like they going to juvie.

345
00:27:54,254 --> 00:27:57,840
No, man. They going to the gates.

346
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,347
-Yo, man, what happened?
-They were stealing.

347
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:53,062
Come on, Tre. Let's go, son.

348
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:23,884
Come here, Rick.

349
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:26,011
Come on, man.

350
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:29,515
Come here, man. Look at all
these people back here.

351
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:33,143
There you go!

352
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:35,562
Want to learn how to barbecue?

353
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,903
You're not watching this meat.
You just standing here poking at it.

354
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,572
-Give him to me, Ricky.
-Shanice, I got him.

355
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:47,366
Go on back to your friends.

356
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,662
-He's wet. That's why he's crying.
-He ain't wet. Now, go on back.

357
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:54,790
-Okay.
-Listen, I'm sorry. Come here.

358
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:00,212
See? That's how y'all got that one.

359
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:04,883
Ricky, you make sure
she taking them pills.

360
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:07,344
I don't want a whole stack
of these around.

361
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,805
I'll be the one taking care of them.

362
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:12,558
-I'll put him to bed.
-Go on to Grandma.

363
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:16,895
It's all right. All right,
okay, shut up, come on.

364
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,189
And flip that meat over.

365
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:25,863
I'm winning.

366
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:30,326
Domino, motherfuckers.
What you say about that?

367
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:35,372
Fool, that ain't shit.
I beat your ass three times already.

368
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:37,833
That's just once. Let's play again.

369
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:43,756
Fuck that, I don't want to play no more.
Let's bust some spades.

370
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,425
-Yeah, I'm with that.
-Bust some spades?

371
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:48,218
Cool.

372
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:55,434
-Know how to play spades, Dook?
-Something like that.

373
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:58,645
I have something for you to suck on.
Here, cut that, G.

374
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:03,776
I want one of them hootchies
over there.

375
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:13,869
Dooky, you full of shit. No bitch
gonna give your ugly ass no pussy.

376
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,913
I bet I get more pussy than you.

377
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:17,790
Yeah.

378
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,292
You get dopehead pussy.

379
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:23,629
I get more pussy than your
wannabe mack-daddy ass--

380
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:26,590
-Who you calling wannabe mack?
-You, nigga!

381
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:29,134
No-pussy-getting motherfucker!

382
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:32,304
Fucking them dopeheads,
you stupid-ass nigga.

383
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:36,141
You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dopeheads.

384
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:39,311
I let them suck my dick,
but I don't fuck them.

385
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:41,772
They got AlDS and shit.

386
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:45,984
You can catch that shit from letting
them suck on your dick too.

387
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:47,319
Thank you.

388
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,281
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.

389
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:53,492
What you mean, you ain't skinny?

390
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:56,995
Motherfucker's skinny enough to
Hula Hoop through a Cheerio.

391
00:31:57,288 --> 00:32:02,418
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.

392
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,963
-Mark ass.
-Y'all trying to scare me.

393
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:13,220
Can you really get it from
letting them suck it?

394
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,930
Mark.

395
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,702
Tre? How you doing, baby?

396
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:39,872
-Fine.
-Good, you just in time for the food.

397
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:42,374
I'm bringing out
the rest of the things.

398
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,960
Potato salad. You name it, we got it.

399
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:49,214
-Everybody's here, have a good time.
-Okay.

400
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,884
Oh, and Tre? Baby, do me a favor.

401
00:32:52,093 --> 00:32:55,596
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?

402
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:59,266
I am so sick and tired of him
going in and out of there.

403
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,519
Maybe some of what you got
will rub off on him.

404
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,396
Okay.

405
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:13,989
What's up, Dough?

406
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:18,285
Oh, shit! What up, G?
Tre, love in effect.

407
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:20,078
Yo, what's up, Tre?

408
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:24,416
-What's up, Chris?
-Heard you're like Mr. GQ Smooth.

409
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:30,005
-Working over at the Fox Hills Mall?
-I get discounts on clothes, you like?

410
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,425
You look like you selling rocks.

411
00:33:33,635 --> 00:33:37,763
-Tre, you be slinging that shit?
-No, I don't be doing that shit.

412
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:40,933
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.

413
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:45,020
You know, I'm out of the pen now.

414
00:33:46,272 --> 00:33:48,607
Trying to keep my ass out this time.

415
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:52,611
-That's what we here to celebrate.
-Yeah.

416
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:56,156
Damn, brother,
how did you get so big?

417
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,826
Pumping iron and eating, man.

418
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,579
Nothing else to do in
the motherfucking pen.

419
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:05,916
Three hots and a cot,
know what I'm saying?

420
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,753
Rest of the time I was reading
and writing my girl.

421
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:12,172
-Reading?
-Yeah, motherfucker.

422
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:15,676
I ain't no criminal. I can read, bitch.

423
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:19,680
Who is that, Shanice?

424
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:22,182
That's Tre, Ricky's best friend.

425
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:25,310
He was best friends with Doughboy
when they was little.

426
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,813
They be trying to act
like they brothers.

427
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:31,775
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!

428
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:35,821
-He go to Washington?
-He go to Crenshaw.

429
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,949
I seen him before.
He work at the Fox Hills Mall.

430
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:42,369
Do he got a girlfriend?

431
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:44,830
Yes.

432
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,842
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping
on this ho's man.

433
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:01,179
He fine, anyway. You better watch
his ass. Somebody might steal him.

434
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:06,184
All right, y'all, come and get it!

435
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:18,655
-Do you live here?
-Okay, girl. Sorry-ass niggas.

436
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:20,741
Come on.

437
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:25,037
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen
and let these ladies eat first!

438
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:29,875
Yeah, you act like you ain't
never had no barbecue before.

439
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:32,711
Let the ladies eat.
Ho's gotta eat too.

440
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,173
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho.

441
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:38,717
Oops. I'm sorry, bitch.

442
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:42,429
-Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
-Just playing.

443
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:45,432
All right, enjoy. And be nice.

444
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:49,936
Get out of the way!
You still up here?

445
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:54,358
-Hi.
-Hello.

446
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:56,652
So why haven't you called?

447
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,031
Just one minute.

448
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:14,086
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.

449
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:16,922
-I know. I'm just taking my time.
-Oh, I see.

450
00:36:17,173 --> 00:36:21,051
-You trying to run that game on her.
-Yeah, how am I doing?

451
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,929
Well, you're doing just fine.

452
00:36:24,222 --> 00:36:26,473
-Except for one thing.
-Yeah, what's that?

453
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:27,933
She left.

454
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:29,393
What?

455
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:32,729
-Damn!
-That's all right.

456
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:36,400
Hey, hey, hey.

457
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:42,948
Ain't this a bitch?

458
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,120
Wait! Wait!

459
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:55,460
-Don't worry about it. I got her.
-Is she all right?

460
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:57,963
All right, G.

461
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:08,807
Sheryl! Come on!

462
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:16,314
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.

463
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,234
You got some blow?
You got some rock?

464
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:23,822
-I'll suck your dick.
-Just keep the baby out the streets.

465
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:28,827
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.

466
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:41,173
What up, punk? What up, fool?

467
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:47,179
Mark.

468
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,863
-What is that? Barbecue?
-Yeah.

469
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,374
-I know you didn't bring me no swine.
-No.

470
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,294
Mrs. Baker told me
to bring you a plate.

471
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:22,214
-Brenda, huh?
-Yeah.

472
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:26,551
She might've had a chance
if she didn't talk so much.

473
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:29,888
Let's see.

474
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:42,025
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.

475
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:47,614
Hey, Pop, can you fix my fade
back here? And up here?

476
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:49,741
I'm eating.

477
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,619
After you eat.

478
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:56,832
Yeah.

479
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:02,712
Yeah, real close.

480
00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:06,424
So I can brush it, you know,
hook up some waves.

481
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:12,973
Something wrong?

482
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:15,600
Nope.

483
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,986
What's the problem?

484
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:30,115
You're getting old, Pop.

485
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,368
-I'm getting old?
-Yeah.

486
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:36,454
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.

487
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:39,165
-You older than dirt.
-I'm older than dirt?

488
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:43,587
-Yes.
-I ain't but 17 years older than you.

489
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:46,923
Your friends, they got fathers
in their 40s and 50s.

490
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:51,011
These cats are great big....
Just slobs, man.

491
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:55,015
-You know, bellies out to here.
-Yes. That's gonna be you!

492
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:58,476
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old, fat, juicy roll...

493
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:01,313
...double-jelly-roll belly. Right?

494
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:05,317
Sitting in a rocking chair,
reading the funny papers!

495
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:08,612
Then your grandchildren will be
running around, saying:

496
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:12,490
"Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar."

497
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,825
You think so, huh?

498
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:15,452
Yeah.

499
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:17,495
Wait a minute, man.

500
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:21,625
What's all this
about grandkids, man?

501
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,627
You using the rubbers I gave you?

502
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:26,922
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy,
all right? I just....

503
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:29,674
I ain't ready for all of that.

504
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:32,344
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

505
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:34,846
Why are you sweating me, man?

506
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:38,808
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it. Come here.

507
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,226
What?

508
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:42,979
All right?

509
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:54,449
What? I stink now?
I got something on me?

510
00:40:56,494 --> 00:40:58,370
-You had some pussy yet?
-What?

511
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:01,998
-You had some pussy yet?
-Yeah! Yeah!

512
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,458
When?

513
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,502
-What?
-When?

514
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,216
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.

515
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:13,385
Go on, sit down, now.

516
00:41:21,394 --> 00:41:26,064
It was a Sunday, right? Rick and I
were kicking it up on Crenshaw.

517
00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:28,733
This group of females
rolled up in a Rabbit.

518
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:33,905
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?

519
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:38,702
Man, there was this one girl
everybody was trying to rush.

520
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:41,371
Baby was fine!

521
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:45,041
Body was booming,
like right out of Jet centerfold.

522
00:41:47,378 --> 00:41:49,087
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.

523
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:53,133
She walks right up on me
and busts out, "Is this your ride?"

524
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:56,928
Then I say, "Yeah, you want to go
for a ride with me?"

525
00:41:57,096 --> 00:42:00,390
She says, "No, I want to drive it."

526
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,227
I say, "Can you drive stick?"

527
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:08,606
She says,
"I can learn if you teach me."

528
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,529
I go into mack-daddy mode because
I'm getting a woody in my sweats.

529
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:19,451
I says, "Why don't you give me your
number, I'll call you for a lesson."

530
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:22,454
She does.

531
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,623
About a week later,
I'm over at her house.

532
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,668
Her mom and grandma
are leaving for church.

533
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:31,463
I walk right up to the door, man.

534
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:35,133
As soon as I go inside, boom!
We go at it, nonstop.

535
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:36,968
Kissing, hugging, right?

536
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:40,138
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.

537
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:47,645
Well, about 20 minutes into it,
Mom and Grandma's come home.

538
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,065
Seems Grandma forgot her purse.

539
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:53,693
Wanted to make sure she has
something for the collection plate.

540
00:42:55,821 --> 00:43:00,075
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex
in the air or something, right?

541
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:07,957
She starts straight
towards Tisha's room.

542
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:15,381
That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.

543
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:18,510
I call her once in a while...

544
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:24,182
...but when I do, her mom or grandma
say, "She can't talk right now.

545
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,102
She busy, doing the dishes."

546
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:34,025
-What'd you use?
-I used the number she gave me.

547
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:38,696
Why are you sweating me?

548
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:41,866
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.

549
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:50,667
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...

550
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:52,919
...you use something anyway.

551
00:43:56,882 --> 00:43:59,551
A pill ain't gonna keep
your dick from falling off.

552
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:06,057
I don't know why you insist on
learning things the hard way...

553
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:08,893
...but you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!

554
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:14,232
Clean up that hair.

555
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:26,536
What's up, man?

556
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:30,081
-What the fuck is wrong with you?!
-What?

557
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:33,793
You slamming my door like
some gorilla on a football field!

558
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:37,589
-Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

559
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:47,599
Guess what, man.

560
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:51,269
-Recruiter from SC's coming tonight.
-Cool.

561
00:44:52,396 --> 00:44:54,898
You know, man,
I never lied to my father.

562
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,774
Never?

563
00:44:57,776 --> 00:44:59,694
Well, almost never.

564
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:03,573
Where's all this coming from?

565
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:05,742
Where's all this coming from?

566
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:10,330
I lied to Pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.

567
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:12,957
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?

568
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:15,126
Is you?

569
00:45:16,295 --> 00:45:18,463
Well, technically speaking, I haven't.

570
00:45:18,714 --> 00:45:21,007
You know, I fingered
a couple of honeys...

571
00:45:21,258 --> 00:45:25,929
...and sucked on some titties,
but I ain't never stuck it in.

572
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:27,430
Why not, man?

573
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,351
-You really want to know?
-Yeah, I asked you, didn't I?

574
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:34,604
I was afraid.

575
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,986
-Shit!
-Get off me.

576
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:53,039
-See, man? Shut up. Shut up.
-What you doing, man?

577
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:57,877
What you afraid of, man?

578
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:00,255
Of being a daddy.

579
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:03,967
Oh, well, yeah.

580
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:05,843
But I'm getting old now, see?

581
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:09,973
And now that I want to flap some
skins, Brandi ain't even down for it.

582
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:14,519
-Even with a jimmy she ain't down.
-Is that right?

583
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:22,610
Straight up?

584
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:26,864
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that.

585
00:46:27,283 --> 00:46:28,741
What's that?

586
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,035
All right, you got it.

587
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:33,705
-I don't see that.
-Why the silent treatment?

588
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:36,165
You haven't talked to me
in five days!

589
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,543
You tell your father to say
you're not home.

590
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:42,672
-Then you take the phone off the hook!
-Well, I been busy.

591
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:47,510
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass
excuse for a lie like that!

592
00:46:47,803 --> 00:46:51,889
What did I do that was so bad that
you just had to stop talking to me?

593
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:56,227
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the program.

594
00:46:56,729 --> 00:47:01,190
I told you about that. I'm Catholic,
and it goes against my morals.

595
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,195
Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed
to be one of the biggest hootchies.

596
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:11,242
-When you bust a cap on somebody?
-I bust a cap like, blam-blam.

597
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,745
Damn! God!

598
00:47:28,052 --> 00:47:31,095
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!

599
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,437
You say you want to wait till
you get married first, right?

600
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:41,147
No, look at me. Right?

601
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:42,565
Yes.

602
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:46,736
And I say that I'm gonna be
the one who marries you.

603
00:47:47,404 --> 00:47:50,615
So it don't make no difference
when we do it...

604
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,492
...we still gonna get married, right?

605
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:55,453
Yeah, but I'm going to college
before I marry...

606
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:59,248
...and there ain't no guarantee
that I'm gonna marry you!

607
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:08,800
Bad shit!

608
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:11,969
-Shit, look at this.
-Oh, shit.

609
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:15,098
Hey, hey, yo. Yo, bonita.

610
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:17,975
Damn, she got a banging ass.

611
00:48:18,185 --> 00:48:22,313
Chica bonita. You come to my casa
and let's do the loco thing.

612
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:25,691
Hey, Dooky, this fool trying
to speak Spanish....

613
00:48:27,778 --> 00:48:29,821
-That shit worked.
-What up, baby?

614
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,199
So let me knock the stuffing
off that Egg McMuffin.

615
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:35,952
You got a phone number?

616
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:51,509
-You haven't even given me a ring!
-I ain't ready for all that yet!

617
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:54,178
But you're ready to act
like we are, though?

618
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:02,687
-With your mad self.
-Don't touch me.

619
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,063
All right.

620
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,205
-You make me sick, man.
-I know, but I missed you.

621
00:49:21,498 --> 00:49:22,874
I missed you too.

622
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,709
I missed you too.

623
00:49:37,723 --> 00:49:39,682
He still ain't fucked her yet.

624
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:50,526
You better take your ass
to the store with that.

625
00:49:51,028 --> 00:49:53,279
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

626
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:56,616
No, that's not all I think about.

627
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:58,534
Yeah.

628
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:02,246
-Okay, hang on. Pop!
-Yo!

629
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:04,749
Brandi's mom say you're cute!

630
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:08,252
Ask her how come she don't say hi
when I speak to her.

631
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:11,631
He say, how come she don't say hi
when he speak to her?

632
00:50:12,758 --> 00:50:13,925
Yeah.

633
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:18,930
Hey, I'm supposed to be talking
to you, not passing messages.

634
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:23,768
If my daddy mess with your mama,
we gonna be brother and sister.

635
00:50:24,019 --> 00:50:26,437
Then we have to do
that incest thing.

636
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:27,939
What?

637
00:50:28,232 --> 00:50:32,527
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.

638
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:35,446
Who this?

639
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:37,532
Oh, hi, Mama.

640
00:50:38,116 --> 00:50:41,661
Yeah. Hang on, I got Brandi
on the other line, okay?

641
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,084
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

642
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:50,962
Tre, this is your mother.

643
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:56,300
I'm sorry, Mama.
Hang on for one second. Okay.

644
00:50:57,427 --> 00:51:00,263
Brandi?
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

645
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:01,472
Okay.

646
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,433
Hi, Mama.

647
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:06,686
"Who this?"

648
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:09,355
What kind of way is that
to answer the phone?

649
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,315
I'm sorry, Mama.

650
00:51:11,692 --> 00:51:15,861
-Why didn't you come this weekend?
-I was cooling with Rick.

651
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:19,574
You can cool
with your friends anytime.

652
00:51:19,825 --> 00:51:22,785
The weekends are supposed
to be our time together.

653
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:27,164
Have you thought about
what we talked about?

654
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah.

655
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:30,960
And?

656
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,629
I don't know yet.

657
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:37,675
Let me speak to your daddy.

658
00:51:39,344 --> 00:51:40,344
Pop!

659
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:41,971
Telephone!

660
00:51:45,017 --> 00:51:46,017
Who this?

661
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:49,020
Hey, how you doing?

662
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:53,024
Yeah. Yeah, we talked about that.

663
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:57,028
Yeah, well, look....

664
00:51:57,696 --> 00:52:01,032
I know you don't agree with me,
but I think it's his decision.

665
00:52:01,325 --> 00:52:04,493
Look, I don't--
No, I don't think that's necessary.

666
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:09,165
Look, Reva. Reva, this is bullshit.

667
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,918
I'm sorry, but I think it's ridiculous.

668
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:17,048
There's no reason for him
to come live with you now.

669
00:52:17,257 --> 00:52:19,050
He's not a baby!

670
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:20,843
No.

671
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:24,263
No, no, wait a minute.
Why you got an attitude?

672
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:26,724
I don't have an attitude.
You have an attitude!

673
00:52:27,184 --> 00:52:30,728
We have gone through this
a thousand times. I always tell him...

674
00:52:30,937 --> 00:52:33,397
...use a rubber!
You know, use a rubber--

675
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:36,150
Watch me shoot this motherfucker.

676
00:52:37,235 --> 00:52:38,444
Look.

677
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:42,031
Yeah.

678
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:45,868
-Taken off the motherfucking set.
-Hey, yo, Monster, man.

679
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:49,955
Don't be cussing so motherfucking
loud. My moms don't like that shit.

680
00:52:50,207 --> 00:52:54,085
Come on, man, move the plastic.
You're sitting on the good part.

681
00:52:54,378 --> 00:52:55,586
Damn!

682
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:57,046
Darin?

683
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:00,966
See, now I gotta hear this shit.

684
00:53:02,094 --> 00:53:03,469
Darin!

685
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:07,264
-What?
-Get them drive-by shooters out of--

686
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:11,435
Damn! Moms be fucking
with his ass without fail.

687
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:13,604
She ain't like that with Rick, though.

688
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:15,981
Because they got different daddies.

689
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:20,611
Y'all got to get the fuck out.
My brother got company in a minute.

690
00:53:20,904 --> 00:53:24,198
-See that? I didn't get my turn.
-It's Monster's fault.

691
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:26,450
Come on, man. Fix that shit, man.

692
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,125
What up, man?

693
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:36,001
What up, dude?

694
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:37,712
Who that?

695
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:10,161
Anybody know
where Ricky Baker lives?

696
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:13,164
That's my brother! He live here.

697
00:54:13,373 --> 00:54:15,666
Hey, yo, Rick!
The man here to see you!

698
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:17,334
Stop.

699
00:54:19,796 --> 00:54:22,173
Stop. Hold still. Be still.

700
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,340
There, I got it.

701
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,135
Yo, Rick! Get your ass out of there.

702
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:29,180
Ricky, come on out
of the bathroom, baby.

703
00:54:30,682 --> 00:54:32,975
Check this out.
Here come the reverend.

704
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:39,273
So, what college you from?

705
00:54:39,524 --> 00:54:41,525
I'm from USC.

706
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:44,195
You got to have a scholarship
to go to SC?

707
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:46,864
No, but it helps.

708
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,283
Can you hook me up
with a scholarship?

709
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,787
-What do you do?
-I used to play baseball.

710
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:54,538
Shut up, man.

711
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,209
Don't you know
the man's about business?

712
00:54:58,502 --> 00:55:01,712
Move, nigga. Move, punk.

713
00:55:02,547 --> 00:55:03,839
Move.

714
00:55:08,178 --> 00:55:09,720
Y'all be the fuck quiet.

715
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,013
Hello.

716
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:13,808
I'm Lewis Crump.
You must be Ricky's mother?

717
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:15,226
Brenda.

718
00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:17,853
And this is my other son, Darin.

719
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:19,563
-Hello, Darin.
-What's up?

720
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,732
Can I get you something to drink?

721
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,235
-Coffee, water, soda?
-No, thank you.

722
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:27,112
We met at the game
against Washington.

723
00:55:27,364 --> 00:55:32,201
I remember. That was a good game.
You picked up 276 yards in that game.

724
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,036
-That's impressive.
-Thanks.

725
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:36,747
Well, why don't y'all sit and talk?

726
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:39,458
Hey!

727
00:55:58,228 --> 00:56:02,398
I want you to know, we're interested
in you coming to the campus.

728
00:56:02,607 --> 00:56:06,151
Get a good look around, you know,
a feel for the school as a whole.

729
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:13,659
Here's my tape.

730
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,001
That was against Banning
my junior year.

731
00:56:23,378 --> 00:56:26,505
Man, we lost that year,
but I did pretty well in yardage.

732
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:30,384
They had the best defense
in the city that year.

733
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:37,099
Big country booty!
Big country titties!

734
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:39,810
-Boo-ya!
-That's what I'm saying.

735
00:56:40,103 --> 00:56:43,105
From eating all that corn bread
and shit, I guess.

736
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:49,153
Shit. Me, I go to college
just for the ho's.

737
00:56:49,446 --> 00:56:51,196
You don't go there to talk to bitches.

738
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:53,657
You're supposed to be
learning something.

739
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:57,286
Can't learn shit,
talking to no stupid-ass bitch.

740
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:04,335
-Yo, check out that 808.
-Damn, that shit bumping.

741
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:08,339
What are you interested in
beside playing ball?

742
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:11,842
-Like, what you mean?
-I mean...

743
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:16,013
...what do you want to major in? What
kind of degree would you pursue?

744
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:19,558
I'm just asking because
there's a strong possibility...

745
00:57:19,851 --> 00:57:22,686
...that you won't go into the NFL
after college.

746
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:25,189
Just a fact. It happens.

747
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,150
Yeah, I heard that before.

748
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,820
Actually, I was thinking
about majoring in business.

749
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:36,492
I got this friend, Tre, who's always
talked about going into business.

750
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:39,203
Plus, I like computers.
Maybe I could do that.

751
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:41,246
What do you think?

752
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:45,334
Young brother, I think you can do
anything you put your mind to.

753
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:53,384
I tell you where y'all need to go.

754
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:57,846
Where they got more women
than anywhere. Fine ones too.

755
00:57:58,056 --> 00:58:00,474
-Crenshaw on Sunday nights.
-No.

756
00:58:00,684 --> 00:58:04,228
-Street races on Florence?
-No, nigga. Y'all way off.

757
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:06,730
I give y'all a hint.

758
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:08,899
Everybody's been there.

759
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:12,403
-Where?
-Where, nigga? Spit it out!

760
00:58:13,196 --> 00:58:14,405
The church.

761
00:58:14,614 --> 00:58:16,740
Oh, shit!

762
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:21,870
Nigga, please! Ain't nobody going
to church to catch no bitches.

763
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,083
I should roll your ass up off
this porch for that stupid shit.

764
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:30,713
So basically you have
a 2.3 overall GPA...

765
00:58:30,922 --> 00:58:33,007
...according to the classes
we require.

766
00:58:33,258 --> 00:58:35,592
All you have to do
is take the SAT test.

767
00:58:36,302 --> 00:58:37,594
Yeah.

768
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:39,930
I heard about that test.

769
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,559
The next one's being offered,
let's see...

770
00:58:43,893 --> 00:58:46,395
...early October.
Are you gonna take it?

771
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:49,440
I guess so. I can't get into
college without it, right?

772
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:53,610
Just remember, all you have
to do is get over a 700.

773
00:58:54,112 --> 00:58:56,947
-Okay.
-Come here. Come here!

774
00:58:57,615 --> 00:59:01,577
I'm sorry, I'm trying to give
him a bath. Come here.

775
00:59:03,663 --> 00:59:05,122
Your little brother?

776
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,791
No, that's my son.

777
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:15,132
Well, I'll look forward
to talking to you again.

778
00:59:15,675 --> 00:59:17,843
We'll also arrange that tour for you.

779
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:19,678
Thank you, Mr. Crump.

780
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,806
You bet, Ricky. Bye-bye.

781
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:31,148
You gonna give me a scholarship?
Because I want to go to college too.

782
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:34,318
-Man, shut the fuck up.
-Fuck you, nigga.

783
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:36,987
It's my porch.
You can take your dumb-ass home.

784
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:40,115
My baby is going to a university.

785
00:59:42,202 --> 00:59:45,162
I always knew you would
amount to something.

786
00:59:45,663 --> 00:59:46,830
I did.

787
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:51,668
When you were little, you used to
always run around with that football.

788
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:55,172
I'm proud of you, baby.

789
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,300
-Thanks, Mama.
-You make your mama proud.

790
01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:04,181
May I have your attention?

791
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:08,143
The SAT test will be
administered in this room.

792
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:12,689
When you receive your test book,
please keep it closed on your desk.

793
01:00:12,857 --> 01:00:16,026
Read the directions on the
front cover of your test book.

794
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,655
Use a number two pencil in
marking your answer sheet.

795
01:00:19,864 --> 01:00:23,117
Ink or ballpoint pen
is not to be used.

796
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:27,204
If you do not have
a number two pencil with you...

797
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:31,875
...raise your hand and keep it up.
We'll pass a pencil out to you.

798
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:36,547
During the time allotted for a section,
you may work on that section only.

799
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,383
If you finish a section
before time is called...

800
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:44,388
...you may not go back to a previous
section or on to the next one.

801
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,224
You have 30 minutes
for section one.

802
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:51,061
Open your test books and begin work.

803
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,122
-This it?
-Yeah.

804
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:04,968
Damn!

805
01:02:05,803 --> 01:02:07,971
Baby got more cakes
than Duncan Hines!

806
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:09,473
Damn.

807
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,435
Bet you bite a chip.

808
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:18,815
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't
moved two percent in five years.

809
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:21,985
-"Furious Styles Financial."
-Talk to you later.

810
01:02:28,117 --> 01:02:30,494
So how you guys think
you did on the test?

811
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:33,330
All right, I guess.

812
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:40,879
Those tests are culturally biased.
The only universal part is the math.

813
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,260
You boys must be hungry.
I'm real surprised to see you.

814
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:48,470
Came to see you.

815
01:02:48,846 --> 01:02:51,306
See how you doing.
How's business going?

816
01:02:52,392 --> 01:02:55,560
Well, there's always business,
just not always in here.

817
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:57,020
What do you do, Furious?

818
01:02:57,689 --> 01:03:00,315
You help people get money
for homes or what?

819
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:04,695
Well, there is no "or what."
That's what I do, Rick.

820
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:11,910
-You boys want to see something?
-Do we have a choice?

821
01:03:15,707 --> 01:03:16,790
No.

822
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:59,750
I don't know about all this. Got us
walking around Compton and all.

823
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:02,586
Rick, it's the '90s.

824
01:04:02,879 --> 01:04:05,839
We can't afford to be afraid
of our own people anymore.

825
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:11,636
Would you two knuckleheads
come on?

826
01:04:17,268 --> 01:04:20,562
I want y'all to look at that sign.
See what it says?

827
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:24,399
"Cash for your home."
You know what that is?

828
01:04:25,902 --> 01:04:27,486
-It's a billboard.
-Billboard.

829
01:04:27,779 --> 01:04:29,488
What are y'all, Amos and Andy?

830
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:31,615
Are you Steppin' and he's Fetchit?

831
01:04:31,866 --> 01:04:34,618
I'm talking about the message.
What it stands for.

832
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:37,454
It's called "gentrification."

833
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:41,917
It's what happens when property value
of a certain area is brought down.

834
01:04:43,127 --> 01:04:44,169
-You listening?
-Yeah.

835
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:48,173
They bring the property value down.
They can buy the land cheaper.

836
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:52,469
Then they move the people out,
raise the value and sell it at a profit.

837
01:04:52,804 --> 01:04:57,933
What we need to do is keep
everything in our neighborhood black.

838
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:59,893
Black-owned with black money.

839
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:03,939
Just like the Jews, the ltalians,
the Mexicans and the Koreans do.

840
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:07,609
Ain't nobody from outside bringing
down the property value.

841
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:09,152
It's these folk!

842
01:05:09,946 --> 01:05:13,949
Shooting each other and selling
that crack rock and shit.

843
01:05:14,158 --> 01:05:16,201
How you think crack
gets into the country?

844
01:05:16,452 --> 01:05:20,288
We don't own any planes.
We don't own no ships.

845
01:05:20,498 --> 01:05:24,334
We are not the people who are flying
and floating that shit in here.

846
01:05:24,961 --> 01:05:28,547
Every time you turn on a TV,
that's what you see.

847
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:32,676
Black people selling the rock,
pushing the rock. Yeah, I know.

848
01:05:33,052 --> 01:05:35,512
It wasn't a problem
when it was here.

849
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:37,931
Wasn't a problem
until it was in Iowa...

850
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:41,351
...and on Wall Street where
there's hardly any black people.

851
01:05:41,644 --> 01:05:44,020
If you want to talk about guns...

852
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:47,441
...why is it that there's a gun shop
on every corner here?

853
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,943
-Why?
-I'll tell you why.

854
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:54,322
Same reason there's a liquor store on
every corner in the black community.

855
01:05:54,532 --> 01:05:56,741
Why? They want us
to kill ourselves.

856
01:05:56,993 --> 01:05:59,870
You go out to Beverly Hills,
you don't see that shit.

857
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,164
They want to us to kill ourselves.

858
01:06:02,373 --> 01:06:07,002
The best way to destroy a people is to
take away their ability to reproduce.

859
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:11,673
Who is it that's dying out here on
these streets every night? Y'all.

860
01:06:12,884 --> 01:06:15,343
-Yeah.
-Young brothers like yourselves.

861
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:19,014
What am I supposed to do?
Fool roll up, try to smoke me?

862
01:06:19,223 --> 01:06:22,350
I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker
if he don't kill me first.

863
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,853
You doing exactly
what they want you to do.

864
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:28,523
You have to think, young brother,
about your future.

865
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:32,736
Damn, man.
You know, Furious is deep.

866
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:37,574
-He used to be a preacher?
-He ain't never been no preacher.

867
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:39,576
Just reads a lot.

868
01:06:41,412 --> 01:06:43,580
My brother should've
heard that, man.

869
01:06:44,415 --> 01:06:45,916
Would've done him some good.

870
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,250
Where he at?

871
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:52,255
Where else, man? Up on Crenshaw
with the rest of them fools.

872
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:54,799
-Let's go.
-Cool.

873
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:23,787
-What up, Monster?
-What up, nigga?

874
01:07:24,038 --> 01:07:26,164
Goddamn, there's a lot
of motherfuckers here.

875
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:28,124
Don't be using God's name in vain.

876
01:07:28,793 --> 01:07:29,918
What?

877
01:07:30,127 --> 01:07:31,294
Man, shut up.

878
01:07:32,255 --> 01:07:33,797
Yo, man, you believe in God?

879
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:38,051
Yo, why the fuck y'all get
so damn religi-fied lately?

880
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:40,136
Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.

881
01:07:40,346 --> 01:07:43,974
This is an A and B conversation.
You can see your way out of it.

882
01:07:44,183 --> 01:07:46,309
You can see your way out
of my ride...

883
01:07:46,602 --> 01:07:49,312
...and we'll see your crippled ass
walking home.

884
01:07:49,564 --> 01:07:53,066
Man, look. Do I believe in God?
Yeah, I guess I do.

885
01:07:53,317 --> 01:07:56,778
How else can you have the sun,
moon and stars and shit like that?

886
01:07:56,988 --> 01:08:01,491
Sun, moon, stars, quasars.
Motherfucker sound like Elroy Jetson.

887
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:03,326
There ain't no God.

888
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:08,081
If there was a God, why he be letting
motherfuckers get smoked?

889
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:13,628
-Babies and little kids, tell me that.
-You tell me this, nigga.

890
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:17,340
How you know God's a he? He could
be a she. You don't know that.

891
01:08:17,633 --> 01:08:21,386
For one thing, you don't know what
the fuck I be motherfucking knowing.

892
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,847
I read about this shit
when I was in the pen.

893
01:08:24,098 --> 01:08:28,018
It was this book, right,
and it was telling...

894
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:31,354
...life in the perspective
if God was a bitch.

895
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:36,693
Said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't
be no nuclear bombs, no wars...

896
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:38,862
...because that ain't
in a bitch's nature.

897
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:43,700
Why every time you talk about
a female you say "bitch" or "ho"?

898
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:46,369
-Because that's what you are.
-Nigga, fuck you.

899
01:08:55,379 --> 01:08:56,504
Hey, hey.

900
01:08:56,672 --> 01:08:57,714
What's up?

901
01:08:57,882 --> 01:08:59,341
What up, D?

902
01:09:15,024 --> 01:09:19,152
-What's up, Mon?
-What's up, Rick? Tre.

903
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:23,365
What's happening?

904
01:09:23,574 --> 01:09:25,867
-Where y'all coming from?
-Compton.

905
01:09:26,077 --> 01:09:27,702
What y'all doing over here, man?

906
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:32,707
We're kicking it. Philosophizing
on God, church, bitches and all.

907
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:36,419
I'm schooling these niggas
on the aspect of religion.

908
01:09:36,712 --> 01:09:39,714
-Religion?
-And on factual, actual studies.

909
01:09:39,924 --> 01:09:41,800
You know what I'm saying?

910
01:09:42,093 --> 01:09:43,760
-Y'all coming from Compton?
-Yeah.

911
01:09:43,928 --> 01:09:48,431
-Thought you were scared of Compton.
-Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.

912
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:51,726
It was deep, though.
You should've been there, man.

913
01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:55,271
Pops was talking, speaking, man.
Speaking the truth and shit.

914
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:59,776
Your pops is like
motherfucking Malcolm Farrakhan.

915
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:14,958
Man, what's wrong with you?

916
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:18,628
Fuck you looking at, nigga?

917
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:21,464
I'm still trying to find out, nigga!

918
01:10:22,591 --> 01:10:23,967
We got a problem here?

919
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:28,596
We got a problem here?
We got a problem, nigga?

920
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:30,515
-What up with this?
-Put the gun away.

921
01:10:30,766 --> 01:10:33,435
Can't we have one night
where nobody gets shot?

922
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:37,313
-Shut up, bitch.
-Bitch, I will fuck you up!

923
01:10:37,523 --> 01:10:40,650
Let's get that bitch!
Fuck you like that.

924
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,042
Ferris always trying
to start some shit.

925
01:10:58,627 --> 01:11:02,797
Nigga can't fight, so he always trying
to find an excuse to shoot somebody.

926
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:05,800
That's why fools be getting
shot all the time.

927
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:09,554
Trying to show how hard they is.
Ignorant.

928
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:12,390
Fool, shut up.
You be doing that shit too.

929
01:11:12,558 --> 01:11:13,683
I know.

930
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:37,582
Hey, man, come on. Let's go!

931
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:46,800
I'm getting the fuck out of L.A.

932
01:11:47,384 --> 01:11:49,719
Fuck this shit. Fuck it.

933
01:11:50,888 --> 01:11:54,057
You can't go nowhere without
it getting all shot up and shit.

934
01:11:58,604 --> 01:11:59,687
Shit!

935
01:11:59,897 --> 01:12:01,856
Shit! Fuck!

936
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,533
Driver! Put your hands
on the steering wheel!

937
01:12:30,553 --> 01:12:33,346
-Got any drugs or weapons on you?
-No.

938
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:37,475
I didn't do nothing.

939
01:12:39,103 --> 01:12:41,229
You think you tough.

940
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:44,148
You think you're tough, huh?

941
01:12:48,112 --> 01:12:49,988
You scared now, huh?

942
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:54,367
I like that. That's why I took this job.

943
01:12:55,077 --> 01:12:58,121
I hate little motherfuckers like you.

944
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:04,294
Little niggers, you ain't shit!
Think you tough, huh?

945
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:08,631
I could blow your head off,
and you couldn't do shit.

946
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:11,259
How you feel now?

947
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,178
What set you from?

948
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:18,433
Look like one of them
Crenshaw Mafia motherfuckers.

949
01:13:18,809 --> 01:13:22,312
No, you probably one of them
Rolling 60s, huh?

950
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:27,817
1 2-Adam-63, we have
a possible 187 in blue VW...

951
01:13:27,985 --> 01:13:30,486
...at corner of
Florence and Vermont.

952
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:36,993
Again, a possible 187 in blue VW
at corner of Florence and Vermont.

953
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:38,202
Stay out of trouble.

954
01:13:38,996 --> 01:13:42,498
You gentlemen have
a nice evening now, you hear?

955
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:15,490
Hi.

956
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:21,329
-I thought something happened to you.
-Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

957
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:25,875
I'm tired of hearing them
shooting all the time.

958
01:14:29,964 --> 01:14:32,548
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

959
01:14:34,593 --> 01:14:37,387
I'm tired of this shit.

960
01:14:38,263 --> 01:14:40,974
Those two motherfuckers.

961
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:44,477
I could kill all these motherfuckers.

962
01:14:44,728 --> 01:14:46,562
I'm sick and fucking tired
of this shit!

963
01:14:46,772 --> 01:14:48,564
I'm fucking sick of this shit!

964
01:14:48,774 --> 01:14:52,276
I'm so fucking tired of this shit!
Fuck this shit!

965
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:56,114
Stupid motherfucker!
Fucking fuck you! Fuck you!

966
01:14:56,615 --> 01:15:00,284
I wish I could kill all you!
Come on at me, motherfucker!

967
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:47,457
What's so funny?

968
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,463
I never thought I'd be crying
in front of a female.

969
01:15:55,799 --> 01:15:58,134
You can cry in front of me.

970
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:29,123
What do you think about...

971
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:32,460
...people getting married
while they're still in college?

972
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:35,671
Are you trying to ask me something?

973
01:16:35,881 --> 01:16:37,298
No.

974
01:16:38,008 --> 01:16:41,677
I just wanted to know what you thought
about that kind of situation.

975
01:16:43,305 --> 01:16:48,142
I think it can be good
if two people really love each other.

976
01:16:49,686 --> 01:16:50,853
Really?

977
01:16:51,647 --> 01:16:52,897
Yeah.

978
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:58,736
You sure you're down for this?

979
01:16:59,404 --> 01:17:01,322
Yeah. Are you?

980
01:17:01,532 --> 01:17:02,698
Yeah.

981
01:17:03,408 --> 01:17:06,536
I mean, yes, I am.

982
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:14,210
I don't want to get pregnant.

983
01:17:14,753 --> 01:17:16,254
You won't.

984
01:17:52,457 --> 01:17:54,709
Hi. I'm looking for
a Miss Devereaux?

985
01:17:54,918 --> 01:17:57,378
-She's right over there.
-Thank you.

986
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,890
-Hey.
-Hi.

987
01:18:13,437 --> 01:18:14,896
You look nice.

988
01:18:15,105 --> 01:18:17,190
Thank you. So do you.

989
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:18,608
Thanks.

990
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,318
Thanks for coming.

991
01:18:21,486 --> 01:18:22,612
So....

992
01:18:24,072 --> 01:18:25,573
So this is...

993
01:18:25,782 --> 01:18:27,617
...definitely you.

994
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,413
And what's that supposed to mean?

995
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,499
I thought we were
gonna talk about Tre.

996
01:18:38,128 --> 01:18:39,462
Espresso, please.

997
01:18:39,713 --> 01:18:41,422
Caf au lait, please.

998
01:18:44,927 --> 01:18:47,220
I bought him some shoes yesterday.

999
01:18:47,804 --> 01:18:49,972
Why are you always
buying him stuff?

1000
01:18:50,224 --> 01:18:52,850
Can't I be nice to my son?
Do I have that right?

1001
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:57,021
Yes, but he has a job. You don't
have to always buy him stuff.

1002
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:58,522
Look...

1003
01:18:58,982 --> 01:19:01,484
...did he tell you he wants
to move in with Brandi?

1004
01:19:01,777 --> 01:19:03,653
Yeah. So?

1005
01:19:04,613 --> 01:19:06,489
"Yeah. So?"

1006
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:09,742
So don't you think that's a bad idea?

1007
01:19:14,373 --> 01:19:19,001
I think that Tre is old enough
to make his own decisions, Reva.

1008
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:24,173
You're his father. That means you
were supposed to guide his decisions.

1009
01:19:24,383 --> 01:19:26,842
What have I been doing
for the last seven years?

1010
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:29,762
-Not that, evidently.
-Listen, Reva...

1011
01:19:31,056 --> 01:19:34,475
...it's time for you to let go.
I know you want to play the mommy...

1012
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:38,521
...but Tre is a grown man now.
He's not a little boy anymore.

1013
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:41,857
That time has passed, sweetheart.
You missed it.

1014
01:19:44,027 --> 01:19:45,778
Excuse me,
I'm getting some cigarettes.

1015
01:19:45,988 --> 01:19:48,572
You're not getting off that easy.
Sit your ass down.

1016
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:50,533
Excuse me?

1017
01:19:50,867 --> 01:19:55,705
I said sit down before I raise my voice
and make a fool out of both of us.

1018
01:19:56,873 --> 01:19:58,165
Okay.

1019
01:20:01,211 --> 01:20:05,214
Now it's my time to talk.

1020
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:09,176
Of course you took in
your son, my son...

1021
01:20:09,386 --> 01:20:11,053
...our son...

1022
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:14,348
...and you taught him to be a man.
I'll give you that...

1023
01:20:14,558 --> 01:20:17,310
...because most men ain't man enough
to do what you did.

1024
01:20:17,811 --> 01:20:22,898
But that gives you no reason,
do you hear me, no reason...

1025
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,944
...to tell me that I can't be
a mother to my son.

1026
01:20:28,071 --> 01:20:29,697
What you did...

1027
01:20:30,198 --> 01:20:35,244
...is no different from what mothers
have done from the beginning of time.

1028
01:20:35,412 --> 01:20:38,831
It's just too bad
more brothers won't do the same.

1029
01:20:39,082 --> 01:20:41,250
But don't think you're special.

1030
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:45,880
You may be cute, but not special.

1031
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:50,634
Drink your caf au lait. It's on me.

1032
01:20:54,765 --> 01:20:59,435
Everybody in the mall was running.
Bitches running out of Contempo's.

1033
01:20:59,728 --> 01:21:02,229
Motherfuckers throwing cookies
out the cookie shop.

1034
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:04,231
Niggas was getting their bail on.

1035
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:07,568
I was smoking every motherfucker
that came in.

1036
01:21:07,778 --> 01:21:11,489
I thought I'd let y'all know that.
Understands me?

1037
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:12,782
What's up?

1038
01:21:12,949 --> 01:21:17,119
You missing all the action.
Niggas getting smoked and shit.

1039
01:21:27,422 --> 01:21:28,464
Who's them niggas?

1040
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:30,633
Man, pick Chris up.

1041
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:33,135
Punk might start trippin'.

1042
01:21:33,303 --> 01:21:38,099
That's those fools from Crenshaw.
Damn, I ain't even got my gat.

1043
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:49,944
Motherfucker ain't got
nothing better to do.

1044
01:21:50,195 --> 01:21:53,406
Twenty-seven years old.
Still fucking motherfuckers our age...

1045
01:21:53,657 --> 01:21:55,449
...with his old ass.

1046
01:21:55,742 --> 01:21:56,784
What's up?

1047
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:58,369
Anyway...

1048
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:02,790
...I saw you roll out of Brandi crib
at 2 in the motherfucking morning.

1049
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:05,459
Yo, man, that's my business.

1050
01:22:05,669 --> 01:22:07,753
Yeah. Handle your shit, G.

1051
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:10,464
-Peer pressure, man.
-Handle your shit.

1052
01:22:10,924 --> 01:22:12,675
Don't be like this motherfucker.

1053
01:22:12,926 --> 01:22:16,929
This motherfucker got babies,
in-house pussy.

1054
01:22:17,139 --> 01:22:19,265
Let me do shit like that,
Ma would be like:

1055
01:22:19,516 --> 01:22:21,016
"I ain't having it."

1056
01:22:22,227 --> 01:22:23,436
Ricky.

1057
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:25,521
Ricky!

1058
01:22:26,481 --> 01:22:27,773
You know you heard me.

1059
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:29,525
What?

1060
01:22:29,776 --> 01:22:31,777
I need you to go get some cornmeal.

1061
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:34,238
Yeah. I'll go in a little while.

1062
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:41,495
You wanna land a good job, you have
to know what most employers want.

1063
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:45,749
Like how to motivate yourself.
How to lead others.

1064
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:48,210
How to perform under pressure.

1065
01:22:48,462 --> 01:22:53,132
Learn these things in the Army.
No matter what career you choose...

1066
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:57,178
...you'll really be ready to take off.

1067
01:22:59,723 --> 01:23:01,515
Ricky, get up and go now.

1068
01:23:01,725 --> 01:23:04,101
I can't finish frying the fish without it.

1069
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:07,438
Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal.

1070
01:23:08,106 --> 01:23:11,066
You ought to be happy
somebody's cooking for your ass.

1071
01:23:11,318 --> 01:23:13,861
-Give me some, Dook.
-Here, take it.

1072
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,571
-What's up?
-What's happening?

1073
01:23:15,822 --> 01:23:18,449
D, go to the store for me
and get some cornmeal?

1074
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:22,745
Nigga, I ain't the one she told
to go get it. She's your wife.

1075
01:23:22,996 --> 01:23:24,705
She ain't my wife, man.

1076
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:26,373
Shit.

1077
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:29,084
Might as well be,
y'all got a family and shit.

1078
01:23:29,336 --> 01:23:32,004
"Tecmo Bowl" playing motherfucker.

1079
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,298
Fuck you, man.
Go to the store with me.

1080
01:23:34,508 --> 01:23:35,799
Sure, let's do it.

1081
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:37,092
What?

1082
01:23:37,928 --> 01:23:41,096
Don't fuck me, fuck your wife.
That's why you got a baby.

1083
01:23:41,348 --> 01:23:43,516
You better get out
of my face, all right?

1084
01:23:44,184 --> 01:23:45,976
What's up with Brandi?

1085
01:23:46,228 --> 01:23:49,355
-Hey, you a punk, man!
-Hey, yo, yo. Wait a minute.

1086
01:23:49,523 --> 01:23:50,564
Wait a minute!

1087
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:52,983
This is family business.
Let them fight.

1088
01:23:53,235 --> 01:23:56,237
Y'all are brothers!
You ain't supposed to be fighting.

1089
01:23:56,488 --> 01:23:58,781
You been a punk from day one.
Mama's boy!

1090
01:23:59,032 --> 01:24:00,574
Get him, Dough.

1091
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:04,328
Let them fight, man.

1092
01:24:04,496 --> 01:24:07,164
Brenda, Ricky and Doughboy
are out here fighting.

1093
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:10,209
Hey, hey. Cut that out.
Get off of him.

1094
01:24:10,418 --> 01:24:12,378
Get off of him!

1095
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:14,129
Damn.

1096
01:24:14,673 --> 01:24:16,423
-What you hit me for?
-You all right?

1097
01:24:16,675 --> 01:24:19,343
Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right!

1098
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:27,101
What you hit me for?

1099
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:29,603
It's the test scores. Ricky!

1100
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:32,481
Ricky, baby, your test scores!

1101
01:24:32,941 --> 01:24:34,567
What you hit me for?

1102
01:24:35,485 --> 01:24:37,278
Why you hitting me?

1103
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:40,447
Yo, Dough. Why she hit you?

1104
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:42,324
Shut up, man.

1105
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:45,869
Fuck all that shit.
I'm going into the fucking Army.

1106
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:48,956
-That's all there is to say.
-You're doing what?

1107
01:24:49,165 --> 01:24:51,083
Man, what are you, a damn fool?

1108
01:24:51,293 --> 01:24:53,794
They say I can learn
to work on computers.

1109
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:56,463
Plus, they'll give me
money for college.

1110
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:00,759
Listen to you.
You sound like the commercial.

1111
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:04,013
They don't tell you that
you don't belong to you no more.

1112
01:25:04,264 --> 01:25:07,308
You belong to them,
the government.

1113
01:25:07,517 --> 01:25:09,643
Like a slave or something.

1114
01:25:09,894 --> 01:25:12,104
My daddy told me a black man...

1115
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:15,482
...has got no business, no place
in the white man's Army.

1116
01:25:15,734 --> 01:25:17,526
I heard all that.

1117
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:19,653
I got a little boy to think about, okay?

1118
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:23,782
I don't want to be like my brother.
Hanging out and not doing shit.

1119
01:25:23,992 --> 01:25:26,285
End up dealing 'caine, just like him.

1120
01:25:27,162 --> 01:25:30,706
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

1121
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:33,125
Listen, let me tell you something.

1122
01:25:33,376 --> 01:25:36,128
When you join that Army,
you ain't gonna be nobody.

1123
01:25:41,676 --> 01:25:42,968
Yo, you got any change?

1124
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,262
No, I ain't got no change. See?

1125
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:47,348
What up?

1126
01:25:53,772 --> 01:25:55,689
Yo, chief. Here you go.

1127
01:25:57,651 --> 01:25:59,610
Hey, no problem, bro.

1128
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:04,031
You win anything?

1129
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,993
Wait a minute, man.
I'm still trying to find out.

1130
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:14,458
Shit. Nothing.

1131
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:18,253
-What?
-I said nothing. I didn't win.

1132
01:26:18,463 --> 01:26:20,506
You gotta be Mexican
to win that shit.

1133
01:26:20,757 --> 01:26:24,843
Man, I win this lottery, I won't
have to worry about a damn thing.

1134
01:26:25,053 --> 01:26:30,099
Don't have to worry about no colleges,
no 700 on no SATs. Not a damn--

1135
01:26:30,308 --> 01:26:31,600
Look.

1136
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:38,315
There's that motherfucker
from the other night.

1137
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,570
Okay. When I say "cut,"
we'll cut through these houses.

1138
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:47,366
Cut!

1139
01:26:48,034 --> 01:26:50,744
-Punk ass.
-Get him, man, get him!

1140
01:26:50,995 --> 01:26:52,037
Let's get him.

1141
01:26:52,205 --> 01:26:54,915
Go around the corner.
Cut them off. Come on, go!

1142
01:26:56,459 --> 01:26:57,626
Shit.

1143
01:26:58,128 --> 01:26:59,545
Fucking mangy mutts!

1144
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:00,796
Come on.

1145
01:27:00,964 --> 01:27:02,631
I got you. I got you.

1146
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:05,384
-Come on, let's go.
-Hold on, man.

1147
01:27:06,594 --> 01:27:09,054
-What are you doing?
-I gotta drain the weasel.

1148
01:27:12,308 --> 01:27:17,438
If that motherfucker roll up on the set
one more time, I'll blast his ass.

1149
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,694
Shit! Rick!

1150
01:27:25,572 --> 01:27:27,656
What a relief and shit.

1151
01:27:28,783 --> 01:27:31,285
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute. Let's split up.

1152
01:27:31,494 --> 01:27:33,328
I don't think we should do that.

1153
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,457
I think it'd be better
if we're together.

1154
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:40,961
Them fools ain't gonna do nothing.
They just showing out and shit.

1155
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:46,008
-I'll meet you at your house.
-Cool. I'm out of here.

1156
01:27:49,429 --> 01:27:51,096
Come on, man.

1157
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:29,092
Ricky!

1158
01:29:07,006 --> 01:29:08,382
Ricky.

1159
01:29:10,552 --> 01:29:14,429
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!

1160
01:29:15,348 --> 01:29:16,723
Ricky!

1161
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:21,603
Shit!

1162
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:38,412
Watch his head. Don't hurt him.

1163
01:29:40,164 --> 01:29:41,957
Don't hurt him, man.

1164
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:47,170
Be careful with him.

1165
01:29:59,976 --> 01:30:01,560
Watch his head.

1166
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:03,437
He's dead.

1167
01:30:05,106 --> 01:30:06,773
Let's take him home.

1168
01:30:35,428 --> 01:30:36,637
Mama!

1169
01:30:42,435 --> 01:30:43,685
Mama!

1170
01:30:44,187 --> 01:30:45,395
Mama!

1171
01:30:50,443 --> 01:30:51,818
No!

1172
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:59,660
Ricky! Oh, my God, no!
Not Ricky!

1173
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:04,331
What y'all doing now?

1174
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:06,833
Ricky?

1175
01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:08,919
Oh, my God.

1176
01:31:12,048 --> 01:31:14,549
Ricky? Ricky, baby, get up.

1177
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:18,136
Get up. Wake up, baby.

1178
01:31:18,388 --> 01:31:20,681
Ricky, get up. Get up.

1179
01:31:20,848 --> 01:31:22,182
It's all right. Get up, baby.

1180
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:23,725
Get up. Tre, what happened?

1181
01:31:24,435 --> 01:31:25,769
What happened to him?

1182
01:31:27,563 --> 01:31:29,189
Give me the baby.
Give me the baby!

1183
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,109
Don't touch him!
Don't you ever touch him!

1184
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,778
He don't need to be seeing this!

1185
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:37,489
Ricky, please wake up!

1186
01:31:38,992 --> 01:31:40,200
Mom.

1187
01:31:40,702 --> 01:31:43,912
-What did you do? What did you do?
-It wasn't my fault.

1188
01:31:44,163 --> 01:31:46,748
-What did you do?
-Mama, I didn't do nothing.

1189
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:49,710
I didn't do nothing.
I didn't do nothing.

1190
01:31:49,877 --> 01:31:52,504
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

1191
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:54,923
What did you do?

1192
01:31:55,174 --> 01:32:00,012
What did you do? You did this!
You did this! I'll kill you!

1193
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:05,392
You did it! I know you did it!
You did it! Yes, you did!

1194
01:32:12,358 --> 01:32:14,401
I told you!

1195
01:32:18,865 --> 01:32:21,658
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1196
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:23,493
Oh, my God!

1197
01:32:23,745 --> 01:32:26,329
Ricky, baby! Ricky!

1198
01:32:27,582 --> 01:32:30,459
Meet me at my house
in five minutes.

1199
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:43,013
Tre, what happened?

1200
01:32:43,264 --> 01:32:45,974
-Talk to me. What happened?
-Go home.

1201
01:32:46,184 --> 01:32:48,185
-What happened to Ricky?
-Go home.

1202
01:32:49,395 --> 01:32:51,313
Talk to him.
Something happened to Rick!

1203
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:54,608
I don't know. He just got shot.
Something happened to Rick!

1204
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:59,488
Brandi, I want you to calm down and
I want you to go home. You hear me?

1205
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:01,948
-You hear me?
-Yes.

1206
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:08,205
I'll take care of him.
He'll be all right.

1207
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:12,042
Tre?

1208
01:33:15,505 --> 01:33:17,380
Tre, what are you doing?

1209
01:33:26,516 --> 01:33:28,642
Oh, you bad, now, huh?

1210
01:33:29,102 --> 01:33:31,978
You bad. You gotta shoot
somebody now, huh?

1211
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:34,898
Well, here I am.

1212
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,317
Come on, shoot me.

1213
01:33:39,737 --> 01:33:41,363
You bad, right?

1214
01:33:45,785 --> 01:33:47,619
Look, I'm sorry about your friend.

1215
01:33:48,412 --> 01:33:51,581
My heart goes out to his family,
but that's their problem.

1216
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:54,292
You my son. You my problem.

1217
01:33:56,254 --> 01:33:58,463
I want you to give me the gun.

1218
01:34:04,137 --> 01:34:07,514
I see. You want to end up
like little Chris in a wheelchair?

1219
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:12,352
Right? No, no, you want to end up
like Doughboy, huh? No?

1220
01:34:13,062 --> 01:34:16,439
Give me the motherfucking gun, Tre!

1221
01:34:39,589 --> 01:34:43,508
You're my only son, and I'm not gonna
lose you to no bullshit, you hear?

1222
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,721
I love you, man.

1223
01:34:58,733 --> 01:35:00,609
Go clean yourself up.

1224
01:35:02,653 --> 01:35:03,945
Go on.

1225
01:35:40,524 --> 01:35:41,816
Tre.

1226
01:35:42,485 --> 01:35:43,777
Tre!

1227
01:35:49,992 --> 01:35:51,117
Damn.

1228
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:56,831
Shit!

1229
01:36:37,123 --> 01:36:38,248
Yeah.

1230
01:36:51,846 --> 01:36:52,887
Let me out.

1231
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:03,857
Dough...

1232
01:37:05,067 --> 01:37:06,568
...let me out.

1233
01:37:56,202 --> 01:38:00,789
Where these motherfuckers at, man?
Been out here damn near three hours.

1234
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,875
It's colder than a motherfucker
out here too.

1235
01:38:04,794 --> 01:38:06,127
Let's go eat.

1236
01:38:07,004 --> 01:38:08,254
Cool.

1237
01:38:12,426 --> 01:38:17,222
When you gonna get your hair cut?
It look like something from 1983.

1238
01:38:17,473 --> 01:38:19,099
Ain't nobody cutting my hair.

1239
01:38:19,308 --> 01:38:21,684
I'm like Samson.
My strength is in my head.

1240
01:38:22,395 --> 01:38:24,771
What's up with the babe
you been talking to?

1241
01:38:25,022 --> 01:38:26,648
-Fuck that bitch.
-You scared?

1242
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:29,984
-He ain't scared, he just young.
-And dumb.

1243
01:38:30,444 --> 01:38:32,404
I'm putting ketchup on this.

1244
01:38:32,655 --> 01:38:34,322
Why you put all that ketchup on it?

1245
01:38:34,532 --> 01:38:37,867
Why you worried about it, fool?
These my fries.

1246
01:38:42,623 --> 01:38:44,791
We going to see your girl?

1247
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:47,293
No, I'm going to see my girl.
You going home.

1248
01:38:47,545 --> 01:38:49,546
There they go, right there.

1249
01:38:50,047 --> 01:38:51,840
Turn off the lights.

1250
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:54,342
Hit the lights, nigga.

1251
01:38:54,844 --> 01:38:56,886
Take your ass home
and watch some videos.

1252
01:38:57,138 --> 01:38:58,805
Home with your mama.

1253
01:39:05,146 --> 01:39:07,063
Check that motherfucker out.

1254
01:39:10,276 --> 01:39:12,694
-Shit!
-Let's get the fuck out of here!

1255
01:39:13,571 --> 01:39:15,196
Don't follow me. Go your own way.

1256
01:39:27,668 --> 01:39:30,253
-What the fuck?
-What the fuck you doing?

1257
01:39:30,504 --> 01:39:33,047
This motherfucker's crazy!

1258
01:39:33,299 --> 01:39:36,718
Goddamn, man. And I'm on parole.
Ain't this about a bitch!

1259
01:39:36,969 --> 01:39:38,386
What the fuck you doing?

1260
01:39:39,221 --> 01:39:40,722
Shit!

1261
01:39:40,931 --> 01:39:43,141
Yo, Dough. Let's bail, man.

1262
01:39:43,392 --> 01:39:45,310
-Let's go, man!
-Come on, nigga, now!

1263
01:39:47,188 --> 01:39:48,813
Man, what the fuck?

1264
01:39:50,441 --> 01:39:52,233
Oh, shit!

1265
01:39:52,485 --> 01:39:55,862
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, man. Let's go!

1266
01:40:01,869 --> 01:40:03,369
Fuck you, man!

1267
01:40:03,621 --> 01:40:05,455
Fuck you!

1268
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:09,542
Turn your punk ass over.

1269
01:40:15,716 --> 01:40:19,511
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't pull the fucking trigger.

1270
01:40:20,304 --> 01:40:22,138
What the fuck you doing?

1271
01:40:22,431 --> 01:40:24,015
Come on, man.

1272
01:40:24,225 --> 01:40:25,517
Well, fuck you!

1273
01:40:30,397 --> 01:40:32,148
Dough, let's bail, man.

1274
01:40:32,358 --> 01:40:33,608
Man, let's move!

1275
01:40:33,817 --> 01:40:35,693
-Let's go!
-What the fuck you doing?

1276
01:40:35,903 --> 01:40:38,238
-Let's bail, man!
-Let's go, man!

1277
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:40,698
Come on, nigga, let's bail!

1278
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,661
Damn! Come on!

1279
01:40:45,746 --> 01:40:48,206
Shit, let's get out of here.

1280
01:40:48,415 --> 01:40:50,708
Here come the fucking police.

1281
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:53,836
Get your ass in.

1282
01:40:54,338 --> 01:40:56,589
Let's get the fuck up out of here.

1283
01:43:28,867 --> 01:43:30,451
What's up?

1284
01:43:30,661 --> 01:43:31,911
What's up?

1285
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:38,167
Yo, coz.

1286
01:43:39,378 --> 01:43:42,588
I know why you got
out of the car last night.

1287
01:43:44,049 --> 01:43:46,718
You shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

1288
01:43:47,386 --> 01:43:50,263
You don't want that shit
to come back to haunt you.

1289
01:43:55,728 --> 01:43:58,813
I ain't been up this early
in a long time.

1290
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,403
Turned on the TV this morning.

1291
01:44:07,948 --> 01:44:10,074
Had this shit on about....

1292
01:44:10,909 --> 01:44:14,662
About living in a violent world.

1293
01:44:16,832 --> 01:44:19,500
Showed all these foreign places.

1294
01:44:21,003 --> 01:44:23,171
How foreigners live and all.

1295
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,800
I started thinking, man.

1296
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:32,597
Either they don't know...

1297
01:44:33,932 --> 01:44:35,725
...don't show...

1298
01:44:37,853 --> 01:44:40,730
...or don't care about
what's going on in the 'hood.

1299
01:44:46,028 --> 01:44:48,362
They had all this foreign shit.

1300
01:44:49,323 --> 01:44:51,741
They didn't have shit
on my brother, man.

1301
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:03,461
I ain't got no brother.

1302
01:45:16,183 --> 01:45:18,267
Got no mother, neither.

1303
01:45:21,897 --> 01:45:24,732
She loved that fool
more than she love me.

1304
01:45:25,192 --> 01:45:26,734
Doughboy.

1305
01:45:27,486 --> 01:45:29,487
You got some blow? Got some rock?

1306
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:31,823
Get the fuck out of my face!

1307
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:37,245
Keep them goddamn babies
out the street.

1308
01:45:41,083 --> 01:45:42,875
Did y'all get them?

1309
01:45:54,638 --> 01:45:57,890
I don't even know
how I feel about it neither, man.

1310
01:45:59,977 --> 01:46:02,895
Shit just goes on and on, you know.

1311
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:08,317
Next thing you know,
somebody might try to smoke me.

1312
01:46:12,948 --> 01:46:14,574
Don't matter, though.

1313
01:46:16,952 --> 01:46:19,579
We all gotta go sometime, huh?

1314
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:28,129
Seem like they punched
the wrong clock on Rick, though.

1315
01:46:31,633 --> 01:46:32,925
Yeah.

1316
01:46:35,012 --> 01:46:37,096
I gotta go, coz.

1317
01:46:40,434 --> 01:46:41,726
Hey, Dough.

1318
01:46:44,021 --> 01:46:45,313
What's up?

1319
01:46:52,195 --> 01:46:54,322
You still got one brother left, man.

1320
01:46:55,699 --> 01:46:57,533
Thanks, man.

1321
01:47:01,538 --> 01:47:02,705
-Later, G.
-Later.
