<i>Sitting in the flower bed</i>

00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:21,431
<i>Watching the petals</i>

3
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:28,229
<i>Where did this pretty color</i>

4
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,565
<i>Come from?</i>

5
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:37,113
<i>Such a beautiful flower</i>

6
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:41,784
<i>Flower</i>

7
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:48,958
<i>Such a great day</i>

8
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:56,716
<i>What a great day</i>

9
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:04,766
<i>If you came</i>

10
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:11,147
<i>How happy would I be?</i>

11
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:45,848
Welcome, Mayor Chu.

12
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,975
Have you been well?

13
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,893
Rest in peace

14
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:49,936
Mr. Mayor!

15
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:51,677
It's been so long.

16
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:54,138
- You are?
- The mayor from the next village over.

17
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:56,432
Mayor Chu, welcome.

18
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:57,350
Long time no see.

19
00:02:57,433 --> 00:03:01,229
- Say hello to Mayor Chu In-hwe.
- Please sit over there.

20
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:05,149
Governor, you must be busy
with the election.

21
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:06,400
Don't call me governor yet.

22
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:07,693
I barely won the primary.

23
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:09,904
- Sit down.
- Sir, good to see you.

24
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:10,822
Sit, sit.

25
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:15,993
How's the campaign going?

26
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,995
I need a lot of help.

27
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,456
Please volunteer for the province.

28
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,541
Of course!

29
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:22,708
We're not strangers,

30
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:26,170
we're doing well thanks to you,
we'll do all we can.

31
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:28,047
Stop mincing words.

32
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,342
Come on, let's toast
to the new governor!

33
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:32,426
Stop!

34
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,013
We don't toast at a funeral.

35
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:38,850
You can't hide
stupidity and poverty.

36
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,356
That's good.

37
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:47,150
This tastes funny.

38
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,777
Yeah? It's fermented well.

39
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,780
What's going on
with the casino?

40
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,282
- The casino?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,450
I don't know the details.

42
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,495
Our citizens of Daecheon
just have to live prosperously, no?

43
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,581
Your love for our hometown
is endless.

44
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:06,544
When things go bad, you lure a casino in
and get our children jobs.

45
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:08,629
We're well off thanks to you.

46
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,798
Say no more!

47
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:15,595
We all must repay your kindness,
or we would be animals.

48
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:19,015
Your son got a subcontract
with DL Construction,

49
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:22,893
you sent your daughter
to Las Vakas

50
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:25,521
to become a dealer, right?

51
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:29,400
It's Las Vegas,
you bonehead.

52
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:32,778
No wonder your son
failed everything.

53
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,947
Don't blame your stupidity
on your son.

54
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:36,782
You named your sons
Quartz and Mercury.

55
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,077
You had to name them
after minerals?

56
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:45,750
Bud, wipe your nose,
it's so nasty!

57
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,794
Don't blow your nose my way,
it got on me earlier.

58
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:50,505
So nasty.

59
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:53,716
I must be out of my mind.

60
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:55,259
I'll be right back.

61
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:56,803
Mrs. Chae.

62
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,763
<i>Sitting in the flower bed...</i>

63
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:01,891
My deepest sympathies.

64
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,228
<i>Watching the petals...</i>

65
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,646
Are you okay?

66
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:13,402
<i>Where did this pretty color come from?</i>

67
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,822
I'm so sorry.

68
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:20,117
<i>Such a beautiful flower</i>

69
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:25,665
<i>Such a great day</i>

70
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:28,125
How is this a great day?
Jesus Christ!

71
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:33,965
Why isn't your hotshot daughter
from Seoul here?!

72
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,466
The burial is tomorrow!

73
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,677
Why do you care?!

74
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,930
Does it make sense for
his daughter not to be here?

75
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:44,851
How dare you speak about
my daughter!

76
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,899
My brother is dead!
He's my blood!

77
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:55,945
You raised your kid all wrong!

78
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:59,282
What? You've never
had a child!

79
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:00,575
What did you say?!

80
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,160
Stop that! Let her go!

81
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:04,787
Don't you dare badmouth her!

82
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:11,669
Hey, Jung-su!

83
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,546
Buddy, leave that!

84
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:16,090
Give me that!

85
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,509
You bastard!

86
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:20,178
Hey!

87
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,473
Jung-su!

88
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,601
Jung-su! Come here!

89
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,687
Mayor!

90
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,357
- Sir!
- Someone call 911!

91
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:34,484
911!

92
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:42,617
Innocence

93
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:50,208
The evidence from the previous trial
lacked credibility.

94
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,670
The defendant supposedly murdered
his wife, put her in the tub,

95
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,882
and started a fire in order to
destroy the evidence.

96
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,471
So he must have had a device
of some kind

97
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:08,518
to keep the fire under wraps
for an hour and a half,

98
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:12,146
but no special devices
were found at the scene.

99
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:17,109
Also, time of death
noted in the original trial,

100
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:21,656
which was before 8,
when the defendant was home,

101
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:25,201
I have a witness
who will refute that.

102
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,496
Terry Wilder is a forensic scientist
who performed over 5,000 autopsies,

103
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:31,582
and analyzed murders
all over the world.

104
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,378
In case of high temperatures,
such as at the scene of a fire,

105
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,339
it's almost impossible
to estimate the time of death

106
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:41,384
because the body decomposes
really fast.

107
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:45,638
Simply says, you're saying there's
something wrong with the evidence

108
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,849
presented by the original trial?

109
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,977
Actually, it's absolutely impossible
to say with certainty

110
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,814
that the victim died before or after 8:00.

111
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:58,234
However, I disagree
with the autopsy report saying

112
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,653
that the victim died before 8:00.

113
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:02,864
That is all.

114
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,493
A gift from the pharmaceutical boss's wife.

115
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,245
Buy a HermÃ¨s bag with it.

116
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:16,627
If we shut down the Supreme Court,
we'll get IH's account for good.

117
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:21,841
The firm will be set for the year
thanks to you.

118
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:24,510
You haven't heard?

119
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:27,472
I decided not to take on
the Supreme Court appeal.

120
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,224
What do you mean?

121
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:32,393
You won this massive case.

122
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:36,397
I took on this case
because of you,

123
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:39,734
but this is where I draw the line.

124
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:43,153
Why is our best attorney
pulling our leg?

125
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:47,492
Sir, be selective
when taking on new cases.

126
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:51,412
If we only represent thugs,
we too become thugs.

127
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:55,666
Be sensitive to the crime,
not to money.

128
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:00,755
<i>A harrowing incident took place.</i>

129
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:04,050
<i>At a funeral in the township
of Daecheon,</i>

130
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,512
<i>a guest has died after drinking
pesticide-spiked rice wine,</i>

131
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,347
<i>and four others are in serious condition.</i>

132
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,852
<i>Among the victims is
incumbent Mayor Chu In-hwe.</i>

133
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:20,191
<i>A prime suspect, Mrs. Chae Hwa-ja,
has been arrested and investigated.</i>

134
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,071
I forgot about an urgent matter,
I better go.

135
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:27,406
- We're not done.
- My apologies.

136
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,825
Hey!

137
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,627
Yes, Ms. Ahn.

138
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,463
My case wrapped up well
thanks to you.

139
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:45,883
Detective, I have a favor to ask you.

140
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:48,678
Could you look into
Daecheon pesticide case?

141
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,805
<i>Sure, I'll look into it
and call you back.</i>

142
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:51,806
Okay.

143
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:08,364
Recommendation Letter:
Seoul National University.

144
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,915
Your eyes!

145
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:23,004
I told you not to
look at me like that!

146
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:30,470
Whenever you look at me,
I'm reminded of bad things!

147
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:38,102
Whatever you want to do,
you can't do it until I'm dead!

148
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,440
You'll never get out of here! Never!

149
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,735
Are you crazy? Stop it!

150
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,530
Don't even think about it, bitch!

151
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:51,407
Mom...

152
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:57,663
We spent a lot of money
on Jung-su.

153
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:01,375
Let's talk later.

154
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:15,097
Why should you die?!

155
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:20,311
Staying strong to stay alive
is barely enough!

156
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,816
You can't die!
I should be the one!

157
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:07,400
You don't recognize me?

158
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:12,530
I don't really know.

159
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,116
Who are you?

160
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:23,124
I'm a lawyer,
I've got some questions.

161
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:30,464
Do you remember
what happened at the funeral?

162
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:35,386
Funeral? Did someone die?

163
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:40,349
You don't remember people
drinking poisonous rice wine?

164
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,810
Rice wine was poisonous?

165
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:48,024
Is Jung-su okay?

166
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:50,735
He's fine.

167
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:56,032
Where am I?

168
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,243
I have to go home.

169
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,499
I need to prepare a meal for him.

170
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,876
<i>How far has her dementia progressed?</i>

171
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:10,588
<i>Has she recently
had a traumatic experience?</i>

172
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,383
<i>We'll need to do
a thorough exam.</i>

173
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:20,556
<i>She needs treatment right away,
but in her circumstances...</i>

174
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,143
Kitty!

175
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:26,604
Kitty!

176
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,606
Jung-su, you can't play here!

177
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:29,565
Kitty!

178
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:31,359
Kitty!

179
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,027
That bastard!

180
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,529
Officer! Get him!

181
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:35,655
Officer Lee!

182
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:38,783
This is a crime scene,
get out of here.

183
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,619
I'm a lawyer,
also the prime suspect's immediate family.

184
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:42,954
Immediate family?

185
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:44,872
"Ahn Jung-in."

186
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,416
Jung-in?

187
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,545
It's me,
Choi Seok-gu, from the mill.

188
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,548
Why are you here?

189
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,092
I became a cop,
this is my case.

190
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:04,767
I heard you were a hotshot in Seoul.
I didn't recognize you.

191
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:07,728
It was batshit crazy.

192
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,897
Sergeant, take a look at this.

193
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,789
People dying at a funeral.

194
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,666
Does this make sense?

195
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,294
Mr. Ji died like that,

196
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:32,795
and my dad's barely hanging on.

197
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,090
- I'm sorry this happened at my home.
- That's all I get?

198
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,758
I may have to bury him soon!

199
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:38,759
Kitty!

200
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,720
Jung-su! You idiot!

201
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,854
I got it!

202
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,522
You bastard!

203
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,024
You're ruining the crime scene!

204
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,402
What are you doing?

205
00:14:57,069 --> 00:14:58,988
Are police allowed to use violence?

206
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,281
The thing is...

207
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,328
Return a slap with two!

208
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,663
Don't sit back, hit back.

209
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:10,124
That's what Mom said.

210
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,876
Did you drink pesticide too?

211
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,254
Son of a bitch!

212
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:18,883
Mr. Ji died when he arrived in the ER,

213
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:24,180
and we intubated others
and put them on respirators.

214
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:28,518
Methomyl that was found
at the crime scene,

215
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:32,063
and the pesticide found
in the victim's bodies,

216
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:38,444
and pesticide discovered on
Mrs. Chae's clothes all match up.

217
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:39,612
Mr. Bang Jung-hwan,

218
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,116
you stated that you saw
Mrs. Chae acting weird

219
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:45,868
at the funeral,
could you explain?

220
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:47,537
I left the funeral early,

221
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:51,165
because it was near
bank closing hours,

222
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,169
but I wanted to greet her
so I went back,

223
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:59,966
and I saw Mrs. Chae Hwa-ja and Jung-su
pouring rice wine into the pot.

224
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:01,926
There were many pesticide bottles
next to them!

225
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:05,930
My son doesn't know anything!
He didn't do anything!

226
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,723
Please calm down!

227
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:11,894
This isn't the right one.

228
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,483
She may have signed
the confession during interrogation,

229
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,862
but she does not admit to...

230
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:23,823
When did you sign this?

231
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,706
Chae Hwa-ja, you bitch!

232
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,504
Hwa-ja! Are you okay?

233
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:41,340
Take care of Jung-su!

234
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:44,719
Okay, don't worry!
I'll look after him!

235
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:46,679
Mom!

236
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,347
Mom!

237
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,016
Mom!

238
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:51,267
Jung-su!

239
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:52,602
Mom!

240
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:56,272
Mom!

241
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,357
Jung-su!

242
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:06,823
Don't worry too much!

243
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,538
Aren't you Jung-in?

244
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:19,419
You don't greet your aunt
after more than 10 years away?

245
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,967
Did you retain this lawyer?

246
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,053
Who is she?

247
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,429
She's my lawyer niece
from Seoul.

248
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:34,560
I saw you on TV,
you look prettier in person.

249
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,021
- So good to meet--
- Sir.

250
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:40,149
They've got no concrete evidence,
it's all circumstantial.

251
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,693
Why haven't you objected?

252
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,738
Anyone can see that
initial investigation was messy!

253
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,532
Are you doing your job or not?

254
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,533
One moment.

255
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:53,371
It's only been 12 hours
since I took on this case.

256
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:57,250
Even so, the suspect has no prior
and she's not a flight risk.

257
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,169
How could she be detained
for signing the confession?

258
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:05,466
You might be good
but you're not the only lawyer!

259
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:09,554
I only took on this case out of pity
for a petty sum.

260
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:13,558
Ma'am, I'm done with this case
as of now.

261
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:14,475
What?

262
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:16,727
Wait! Sir!

263
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:18,271
I'm done!

264
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,695
How could you just show up
and mess everything up?!

265
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,991
A lawyer like him
will help create new charges.

266
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,951
Even if you're all that,

267
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:36,122
how could you not even show up
at your father's funeral?!

268
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:40,126
I'm done with this too!

269
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,132
How could your mom cremate him
instead of burying him?

270
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:53,806
<i>Ms. Ahn.</i>

271
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,601
Has your judgment been clouded
as it's a family matter?

272
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:59,312
Looking beyond that,
it's still a weird case.

273
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:02,565
Crime scene integrity
and initial investigation were messy.

274
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:05,902
Every client of ours
says they're being treated unfairly.

275
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:10,448
Sir, am I right?

276
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:15,119
Pharmaceutical chair protecting her son,
Ahn wanting to protect her mom,

277
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:16,287
how are they different?

278
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,748
This isn't about that,
this case is different.

279
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,626
How could someone who doesn't
recognize her child do this?

280
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,004
She said it's different,
we must take her word.

281
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:31,344
I'll send a lawyer there. Why don't you
focus on the pharmaceutical case?

282
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:35,431
The pesticide case will be over when
the defendant is released on sick bail.

283
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:39,227
Please allow me to do this,
I'll be quick.

284
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:45,233
How dare you show up here
after killing my husband!

285
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:47,652
I'm investigating the case
as a lawyer.

286
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:51,739
That makes it all right?
Don't pull that shit on me!

287
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:55,159
We helped out because
we felt sorry for her.

288
00:19:55,243 --> 00:20:00,498
Then she poisoned us?
How is this possible?

289
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,710
Don't got methomyl pesticide anymore.

290
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:08,965
It got banned because
it had too many problems.

291
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,720
But, Uncle, why are people
like this to our family?

292
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:18,516
It's because of that incident,
money is evil.

293
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:21,853
Has it been like this
since the mine scam?

294
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:24,522
Don't even mention it.

295
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,732
After I lost my savings,

296
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,735
your aunt and I got a divorce.

297
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:33,364
Imagine how those
who aren't related to us felt.

298
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:38,661
But how could anyone
mix pesticide in rice wine?

299
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:44,167
Your mom is so unfortunate.

300
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,128
Jung-in,

301
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,382
do you still hate your mom?

302
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,260
<i>Don't do that!</i>

303
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,555
<i>She's a pitiful person.</i>

304
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,752
<i>The witness testimonies could be lies.</i>

305
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:29,795
I think there was a trespasser.

306
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:33,007
There are too many suspicious things.

307
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:37,136
I think she was framed.

308
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,223
She only signed the confession

309
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:45,269
because your brother could be
named co-conspirator.

310
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:48,439
Detective, did you get
what I asked for?

311
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:52,443
Do not tell anyone
that you got it from me.

312
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,101
As you see here,

313
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:29,647
they bullied and screamed at
the defendant,

314
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:36,154
then they promised her
to let her go if she signed it,

315
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,198
so why would anyone not sign it?

316
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:43,911
We also noticed inconsistencies
on photos submitted by the prosecution.

317
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,712
Do you see the bottle prints
on the ground?

318
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:58,426
They were placed here but moved
for the convenience of the police.

319
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,261
You're accusing us of
evidence tampering?

320
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,846
Quiet please!

321
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:07,268
Mr. Bang testified that
he went to the bank before closing,

322
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:12,899
but he was nowhere to be found
in their security camera feed.

323
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:14,942
We suspect perjury.

324
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:20,948
The preliminary investigation
was conducted with suspicion,

325
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:22,325
it's a targeted investigation.

326
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,701
Targeted investigation?

327
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:27,997
Bottles of pesticide were found
at the defendant's residence,

328
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:30,458
the same pesticide was found
on her clothes,

329
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:34,212
and she confessed to the crimes
during interrogation.

330
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:36,756
What other proof do you need?

331
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:38,800
Then please take a look
at these photos.

332
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:48,518
So a prosecutor, detective
and witness can't dine together?

333
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:54,190
The men in this photo are the prosecutor,
primary detective and the witness.

334
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,110
Det. Choi and Mr. Bang
went to the same school since elementary

335
00:23:58,194 --> 00:24:02,073
and are sons of victims
of this case.

336
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:06,911
Do you still deny this isn't
a targeted investigation?

337
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,582
In addition, the defendant's
health is deteriorating.

338
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,962
The detention doctor's report indicates
how far along her dementia is.

339
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:21,259
To get to the truth,
her treatment is urgent.

340
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,431
We request detainment
to be lifted.

341
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:30,017
Release from custody?

342
00:24:31,394 --> 00:24:34,897
Does that make sense?
How could you mess it up?

343
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,776
It's obvious Hwa-ja did it!

344
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:45,158
How could you mess it up
since her kid showed up?

345
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,660
I'm sorry.

346
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:52,957
Mayor Chu, you should first
go to the hospital.

347
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:59,839
Don't ever!
Let her get released!

348
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,425
Did you look into what I asked?

349
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:04,969
We are still looking, sir.

350
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:09,557
Find it at once!
Give Chief Prosecutor Shin a call.

351
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:20,067
It looks to be rapidly progressive dementia.

352
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,987
The shrinking of her brain
must've affected

353
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,158
her judgment, memory
and cognitive ability.

354
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:30,077
At this rate, she should be
out on medical release.

355
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,079
Chief Doctor's Secretary:
Director would like to see you

356
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,540
Could we follow up later?
My apologies.

357
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,666
Sure.

358
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,355
Where's Mom?

359
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,534
Yes?

360
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:11,494
That's correct.

361
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,788
You found her?

362
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,216
Mom!

363
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:31,430
Mom...

364
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:35,268
My baby, my dear boy...

365
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,104
- Did you have dinner?
- Yeah.

366
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,775
Baby, this is that place.

367
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,528
It's here!

368
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:48,739
This is the place.

369
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:52,118
Get up!

370
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,829
Don't cause a scene
and get up!

371
00:26:57,623 --> 00:26:59,417
Mom, Mom!

372
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:01,002
Where are you taking her?

373
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:03,045
The court's order is
to take her back.

374
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,592
Aren't you...

375
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,137
Jung-in, by any chance?

376
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:13,973
And you are?

377
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:16,392
Chopyung Elementary,
6th grade, class 3.

378
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,521
I'm Wang-yong.

379
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:25,026
It's been a while.
You became a cop?

380
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:30,990
Wow, you're still...
Still same old...

381
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:36,996
If you're not busy,
could we talk at the station?

382
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,043
About three months ago,

383
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:46,297
I was on night shift and
your mom came in soaking wet.

384
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:48,716
"My husband is a killer!

385
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,719
Mayor Chu and his friends
are all in on this!"

386
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,056
I calmed her down
and sent her away,

387
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:59,894
but she refused to go home
for a few days and caused a scene.

388
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:02,980
We finally found her
by the reservoir like before.

389
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:05,983
Was there a murder there?

390
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,944
No way!

391
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:12,323
We got a commendation
for crime-free village too.

392
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:16,744
She's got dementia,
she doesn't even recognize me.

393
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,334
I thought this'd help,
I shouldn't have done that.

394
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,547
There are so many weird things
about this case.

395
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,883
It's driving me crazy,
and my mom is sick.

396
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,389
She was close to Mr. Hwang,
so she had no ill will against him,

397
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:39,142
but circumstantial evidence is there.

398
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,520
What do you think?

399
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:46,649
No! Your mom would never do that!

400
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:52,029
Anything I should know about,
stuff happening in the village?

401
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:58,828
Aside from the casino ruckus,
this is the biggest case.

402
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,080
Casino? Here?

403
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:05,710
Yeah, a casino's being built
in the mountains behind the village.

404
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:23,978
<i>And the casino?</i>

405
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,314
They're asking for
a few more days.

406
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,984
Once the construction is done,

407
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,904
they may not pay me.

408
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:37,825
I can't run my campaign
without a payoff.

409
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:41,746
I'll revoke their permit if they
don't pay by the end of the month!

410
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,627
Come in!

411
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:58,095
So you stopped her medical release?

412
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:00,890
Mrs. Chae is back in custody.

413
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:04,185
When today's documents
are included, it's all but dismissed.

414
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,731
Chief Prosecutor Shin,
you do some great work.

415
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,531
Aunt, I have a question.

416
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:20,701
Who introduced you
to the first lawyer?

417
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,161
<i>I don't know.</i>

418
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:24,914
<i>We somehow ended up
retaining him.</i>

419
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:28,167
<i>Why? You're not gonna
take the case?</i>

420
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,336
I just wanted to
check something.

421
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:35,299
I think someone asked me to.

422
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:40,346
I don't remember,
who was it...

423
00:30:42,265 --> 00:30:45,184
Does it have something
to do with the casino?

424
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:46,435
Casino?

425
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,397
I don't know what you mean.

426
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,317
I heard you specialize
in civil cases, no?

427
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,947
There's no specialization
out here in the country.

428
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:04,245
I'm sorry but I'm quite busy.

429
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:05,454
Extremely busy.

430
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:08,666
My apologies,
please forgive me.

431
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,501
Take care.

432
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:19,677
<i>What did she say?</i>

433
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,180
She asked me
why I took on the case,

434
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:26,934
then she brought up
the casino all of a sudden.

435
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:33,065
Probably to confirm something,
there's no need to worry.

436
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,527
She's pretty like a doll.
I'll call you right back!

437
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,696
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

438
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,907
I think I left my cell phone.

439
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:43,993
Oh, my, should I call you?

440
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:49,624
It's right here, goodbye.

441
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,544
Yeah, I don't have
your number anyway.

442
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:58,049
<i>She asked me why
I took on the case,</i>

443
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:02,428
<i>then she brought up
the casino all of a sudden.</i>

444
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:06,265
Mayor Chu

445
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,393
Casino

446
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:13,981
<i>"My husband is a killer!</i>

447
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,692
<i>Mayor Chu and his friends
are all in on this!"</i>

448
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:22,740
Perjury?

449
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:26,994
Ahn Tae-su's funeral?

450
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:18,212
Bank transfer:
Lee Soon-ja - $10,000

451
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:34,812
Lifelong Friendship

452
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,047
Get off me!

453
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:03,007
Fuck off!

454
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:07,804
Who are you?!

455
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,034
Daecheon Karaoke

456
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:33,871
What is this?

457
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:35,914
Test for a fingerprint for me.

458
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,668
An invader at my home
dropped this.

459
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,086
He could be a prime suspect.

460
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,130
It's just a lighter.

461
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,679
See? It's the same.

462
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,180
I go there often too.

463
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,682
The case was handed over
to the prosecution,

464
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:59,105
so go ask them.

465
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,984
- Are we skipping lunch?
- Let's go.

466
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,569
I'm starving.

467
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,285
Where are you going?
You are not cooperating!

468
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:15,663
I got dismissed from this case
because of you.

469
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:25,256
The footprints are mixed up,
this is gonna be tough.

470
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,593
It's neon shoes
with an L in the logo.

471
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,179
The letter L?

472
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:33,639
L...

473
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,308
Don't touch!

474
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:41,772
Don't touch that!
Maintain crime scene integrity!

475
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:43,524
The letter L?

476
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:47,695
Did the prints get ruined?

477
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,701
I found it! I found it! I found it!

478
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,830
I got it! Jung-in!

479
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,252
I got it! The footprint!

480
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:08,007
I think the neon shoes
you saw were...

481
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:10,635
Lecaf.

482
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,472
Look, the sole pattern
is identical, no?

483
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,557
You're right.

484
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,851
A few months ago,

485
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:21,729
there was a massive sale on these.

486
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:24,232
Was there anything else?

487
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,069
I think I scratched his face.

488
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:32,240
He had a burn mark on his face.

489
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:33,366
Burn mark?

490
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:36,077
Why didn't you say so?!

491
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,330
Daecheon Karaoke,
Lecaf shoes

492
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,249
and burn mark.

493
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,422
<i>Mr. Bang's father passed away.</i>

494
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,885
So Bang's finally gone.

495
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:56,889
Pick out some nice flowers for him.

496
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:03,771
By the way, are you going to let her
mess around like that?

497
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:05,648
I'll take care of it, sir.

498
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:48,900
You should have a drink too.

499
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,861
You're a handsome fella.

500
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:53,988
Thank you.

501
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,200
Do you like taking pictures?

502
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,328
Could I take a look?

503
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:21,808
Ahn Jung-su!

504
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:22,809
Yeah?

505
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:26,312
What are you doing?

506
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,980
Who are you?

507
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:32,151
I've been assigned
to your case.

508
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,737
So you were at
the Seoul Central District Court?

509
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:37,198
Chief Prosecutor
Shin Cheol-min

510
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,204
A lot of parties are
interested in this case.

511
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:44,956
Good to meet you.

512
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:53,089
If anyone asks you anything,
just say you don't know.

513
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,842
Don't talk to anyone
except me, got it?

514
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:01,722
Hey, you got a light?

515
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,266
No smoke, bad!

516
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:07,061
Cigarette smoke contains nickel,
naphthylamine, benzene, vinyl chloride!

517
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,355
Why are you being rude?

518
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:11,524
I was just asking for a light,

519
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,776
you're the one being fucking rude.

520
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:19,991
You're Ahn Jung-in
from Daecheon High School, right?

521
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,410
You're glaring at me, bitch!

522
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,536
No!

523
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:25,079
Don't hit my sister!

524
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,291
Protect family,
that's what Mom said!

525
00:39:28,374 --> 00:39:29,917
Who's this idiot?

526
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,674
- Stop it!
- Causing a fucking scene.

527
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,551
Why are you doing this?!

528
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:46,100
Piss off before you get hurt more.

529
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:54,108
Jung-su! Jung-su!

530
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,569
Are you okay? Get up.

531
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:58,988
Are you hurt?
Let me see you.

532
00:39:59,572 --> 00:40:02,408
Oh, my, are you okay?

533
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:03,618
Jung-in...

534
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:18,090
We've received the prosecution's
new evidence submission.

535
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,550
Please elaborate.

536
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,182
In the credit card statement,

537
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:29,310
rice wine was purchased
at multiple shops.

538
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:32,897
It was purchased up to three days
before the incident.

539
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,526
The defendant's husband
enjoyed rice wines.

540
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:41,614
Her husband's condition was
so bad that he was sent home

541
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:43,407
from the hospital.

542
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:47,411
Ergo, the defendant estimated
when her husband would die,

543
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:51,207
and she planned to murder
those who alienated and

544
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,709
shunned him over the period.

545
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,795
Look at the defendant's condition!

546
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:58,798
Does she look like someone
who can plan a murder?

547
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:03,761
She was also said to be close
with one of the victims, Mr. Hwang.

548
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,513
There is no murder motive.

549
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:13,855
Then how can an ailing man like him
keep drinking all on his own?

550
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,731
These photos are from
an unverified source.

551
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:17,733
The one who took these photos
is present here.

552
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,029
He lived with the defendant
for more than 20 years.

553
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:25,199
We request the defendant
Ahn Jung-su as our next witness.

554
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:27,869
Hello! I'm Ahn Jung-su!

555
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,872
We request a motion
to reject him as a witness!

556
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:34,375
The said witness suffers
from severe autism.

557
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,796
He's not fit to testify as he possesses
the intelligence of a 10-year-old.

558
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:40,631
He is a crucial witness.

559
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:44,469
There are precedents
for autistic witnesses in the past.

560
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,608
<i>Mayor Chu, welcome.</i>

561
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:00,109
<i>It's heavy.</i>

562
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,028
Jung-su.

563
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,989
Is this when Mom got sick?
Constitution Day?

564
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,326
Did this man come by often?

565
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:09,660
<i>You've been well?</i>

566
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,205
He's bad man!

567
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,290
Mom was very, very sick!

568
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:17,084
He's bad man, call police!

569
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,711
Call police at 911.

570
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:21,547
When you take the stand,
you'll swear an oath. Say it after me.

571
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,299
When you take the stand,
you'll swear an oath.

572
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:24,592
Say it after me.

573
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,552
No, from now.

574
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:27,553
No, from now.

575
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:33,434
I solemnly swear that
I'll tell the truth, the whole truth.

576
00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:36,604
I solemnly swear that
I'll tell the truth, the whole truth.

577
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,774
And nothing but the truth
under penalties of perjury.

578
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,151
And nothing but the truth
under penalties of perjury!

579
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:50,284
Jung-in, what's perjury?

580
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:52,703
It means if you lie,
you'll be punished bigtime.

581
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,832
I'll ask you some questions,
so answer.

582
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,167
Was your father's
condition serious?

583
00:42:58,251 --> 00:42:59,085
Yes!

584
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:00,378
Very good.

585
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:01,712
He was very sick!

586
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:05,341
He drank even though he was sick?

587
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:07,635
Yes.

588
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:10,263
Who gave him rice wine? Mom?

589
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:11,389
Yup.

590
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,517
I wasn't allowed to go
into his room, I could get sick!

591
00:43:14,684 --> 00:43:16,769
Or Mom beats me.

592
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:24,527
Jung-in,

593
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:30,366
is it your fault that I'm dumb?

594
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:33,828
That's what Dad always said!

595
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:36,455
He said you made me an idiot.

596
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,802
What are you going to do about it now?

597
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,680
You made my only son
into a cripple, bitch!

598
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,099
Didn't you hear the doctor?

599
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:57,602
He was born like that!

600
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:00,396
How dare you interrupt me!

601
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,857
<i>Don't you dare stop me!</i>

602
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:06,611
Mom said it was her fault!

603
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,572
Dad said your fault, Mom said her fault!
Dad said your fault, Mom said her fault!

604
00:44:09,655 --> 00:44:12,325
Jung-su, it's nothing like that.

605
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,248
But why aren't you home?

606
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,210
Was it Jung-su's fault?

607
00:44:25,171 --> 00:44:32,178
So Jung-su was sad,
S-A-D, very sad.

608
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,890
When you're sad,
you get tears, T-E-A-R-S.

609
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:42,146
Does it hurt?

610
00:44:57,578 --> 00:45:00,164
Jung-su, do you have
any other clothes?

611
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,213
Jung-su.

612
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:11,008
When you take the stand,
make sure to look at me.

613
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,262
When I shake,
say "I don't know,"

614
00:45:15,096 --> 00:45:17,473
and when I nod,
say "That's right."

615
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,433
- Understand?
- Okay!

616
00:45:22,812 --> 00:45:26,065
This is the security footage
from the day of the incident.

617
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:32,029
No one else poured rice wine
except the witness.

618
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,992
Let me ask you,

619
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:40,621
did anyone else pour rice wine
in the pot other than yourself?

620
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:45,334
Please answer,
was it just you?

621
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,004
I dunno.

622
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,091
You could be punished
severely for perjury!

623
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:54,051
Were you the only one?

624
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,388
I don't know!

625
00:46:06,439 --> 00:46:10,902
So you are the only one
who poured rice wine.

626
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,321
Yes!

627
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:16,699
Say it loudly,
it was only you?

628
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:18,993
Yes, only you!

629
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,369
Allow me to ask you again,

630
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:24,415
you're absolutely sure
you were the only one?

631
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:28,044
Me... Jung-su...
I don't know!

632
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:30,838
Mom, Mom, Mom!

633
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:34,175
He doesn't know anything!
I did it, it was me!

634
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,718
I killed everyone!

635
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:37,678
The defendant is making
a false confession!

636
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:39,806
She is only trying to
protect her autistic child!

637
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:42,683
I did it, my son doesn't
know anything!

638
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,937
Constitution Chapter 11,
Article 6, Criminal Code 310,

639
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,772
confession alone cannot
establish one's guilt!

640
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,816
- Mom!
- Jung-su!

641
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:52,109
- Jung-su!
- Mom! Mom!

642
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:53,778
Honey!

643
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:56,280
Mrs. Chae!
Someone call 911!

644
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:57,907
Get an ambulance!

645
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:10,336
Make way!

646
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:26,561
Sister!

647
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:27,770
Sister!

648
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:28,813
What are you doing?

649
00:47:29,522 --> 00:47:30,356
Jung-su!

650
00:47:30,439 --> 00:47:32,859
Why you do this?!

651
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:33,985
Jung-su!

652
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:37,405
What are you doing?
You don't have a warrant!

653
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,741
We're arresting Ahn Jung-su,
who confessed to the crime.

654
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,495
Your mother's condition
and her circumstances are bad.

655
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:46,497
We can end this with
a 10-year sentence.

656
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:50,126
More people have died
by tongue than knife.

657
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:52,545
Use your tongue properly
as a prosecutor!

658
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:54,714
I could sue you for
cajoling a lawyer.

659
00:47:55,298 --> 00:47:57,175
This case won't be easy.

660
00:47:58,384 --> 00:48:00,928
Proving the innocence
of an obvious murderer.

661
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:07,852
Just watch me,
I'll prove her innocence.

662
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:19,822
Treatment Report

663
00:48:19,906 --> 00:48:23,242
Chae Hwa-ja - Rapidly progressive dementia

664
00:48:23,326 --> 00:48:26,913
July 17 - Dementia

665
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,712
<i>You've been well?</i>

666
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,760
Mayor Chu Turned Dirt
Into Gold by Luring Casino,

667
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:46,057
Running for Governor!

668
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:53,856
Daecheon Royal Casino
Land Groundbreaking

669
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:16,712
So they're all in league
with each other?

670
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:17,922
Yeah.

671
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:23,094
July 17th, this case started
when Chu visited my home.

672
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:28,724
What happened between
my mom and Mayor Chu?

673
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:37,567
This could break the case
wide open.

674
00:49:39,986 --> 00:49:42,905
Wang-yong, look into the person
who broke into my home,

675
00:49:43,406 --> 00:49:45,032
I'll go visit my mom.

676
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:49,829
My Jung-su doesn't know anything.

677
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:53,374
Yes, I did it all.

678
00:49:54,625 --> 00:50:01,632
If you continue saying that,
your son will be safe.

679
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:07,096
Thank you, sir, thank you!

680
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,017
I beg of you, thank you.

681
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:19,817
Mr. Ahn, don't be afraid.

682
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:22,612
Just answer our questions truthfully.

683
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:24,447
Do you understand?

684
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:27,658
The prosecutor asked you something!

685
00:50:27,742 --> 00:50:28,618
Buddy!

686
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:31,996
Return a slap with two!

687
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,498
Don't sit back, hit back.

688
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:35,958
That's what Mom said.
She did.

689
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:44,091
It was me, I did everything.

690
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:46,385
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

691
00:50:46,928 --> 00:50:48,304
I told you before, didn't I?

692
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:51,057
I said not to talk to anyone
except me!

693
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,893
My Jung-su doesn't know anything.

694
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:58,147
Is he okay? Tell me.

695
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:01,275
How could you only
think of him right now?

696
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:06,322
No, it's all my fault.

697
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,244
Mom? Did you really do it,
you killed them all?

698
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:14,497
Why are you making
your situation worse?!

699
00:51:14,956 --> 00:51:18,042
I'm sorry, forgive me.

700
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:20,545
Be honest,

701
00:51:22,004 --> 00:51:23,506
you really don't recognize me?

702
00:51:24,924 --> 00:51:25,925
Who am I?

703
00:51:27,093 --> 00:51:28,469
Answer me!

704
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:32,515
I'm sorry...

705
00:51:33,975 --> 00:51:38,437
But, miss, is Jung-su
really okay?

706
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:41,858
Stop with the Jung-su crap!
I'm sick of it!

707
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:46,487
Me! What about me?!

708
00:52:06,841 --> 00:52:08,468
<i>You really don't recognize me?</i>

709
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,219
<i>Who am I?</i>

710
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:12,513
<i>Answer me!</i>

711
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:19,437
It's Jung-in!

712
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,688
My daughter!

713
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,106
Mrs. Chae, please calm down.

714
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,608
Let go!

715
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:29,155
It's Jung-in! Jung-in!

716
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,376
Yeah, Wang-yong.

717
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,295
<i>Why don't you ever answer?</i>

718
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,671
<i>I found your home invader.</i>

719
00:52:45,755 --> 00:52:47,215
<i>Go to the police station!</i>

720
00:52:52,512 --> 00:52:56,182
It was raining so I was there
to get out of the rain.

721
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:58,810
Couldn't you get me a lawyer?

722
00:52:59,602 --> 00:53:01,062
Good day, everyone.

723
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:07,026
The case has been handed off to
the prosecution so we'll take over.

724
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,987
It's an unrelated case,
why is the prosecution involved?

725
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:12,740
It happened at the defendant's
home during the trial,

726
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:14,492
so we're taking over.

727
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,162
You ignored requests
for additional investigation,

728
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,122
but now this?

729
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:25,878
As he said, the suspect was
at the defendant's home.

730
00:53:25,962 --> 00:53:27,380
They should investigate--

731
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:29,006
What are you talking about?

732
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,508
- Get to it!
- Yes, sir.

733
00:53:30,883 --> 00:53:31,843
Come with us.

734
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:34,095
This is bad!

735
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:35,638
Where am I going now?

736
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:52,572
Good work, sir.

737
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,494
Holy cow!

738
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,706
Wang-yong, you skipped work?

739
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:04,083
I was worried, I changed shifts.

740
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:10,673
Even if they've got jurisdiction,
they can't intercept it like that.

741
00:54:11,132 --> 00:54:13,801
When a prosecutor sneezes,
cops get the flu.

742
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:17,638
Eh? They're releasing
the suspect immediately?

743
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:19,891
They interrogated Jung-su for days!

744
00:54:53,132 --> 00:54:56,219
They are trying to get the suspect
out of the city.

745
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,805
I'll follow that bastard,

746
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:01,182
you follow the van.

747
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:02,975
Okay.

748
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:04,977
Wang-yong!

749
00:55:05,895 --> 00:55:07,063
Be careful.

750
00:55:24,247 --> 00:55:26,165
Daecheon to Mokpo

751
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:37,088
Lifelong Friendship

752
00:58:31,142 --> 00:58:33,519
I'll try to fix it,

753
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,897
but it's such an old phone.

754
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:39,400
Don't expect much.

755
00:58:39,734 --> 00:58:41,110
Please do your best.

756
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:03,966
Groom: Lim Choon-woo
Bride: Chae Hwa-ja

757
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:20,024
Who is Choon-woo?

758
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,945
Is this him?

759
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:28,074
You know who he is.

760
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,578
Please tell me.

761
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:42,839
<i>Choon-woo was the son
of the quarry boss we worked for.</i>

762
00:59:43,172 --> 00:59:46,551
Will anything bite?

763
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,516
Don't worry,
you'll catch a catfish for sure.

764
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:57,687
I'm just worried that
my wife's lethargic.

765
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:08,739
With Choon-woo dead,
we can take over the quarry.

766
01:00:08,823 --> 01:00:12,451
Sure, we worked there
for so many years,

767
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:14,328
he can't just give it to Choon-woo.

768
01:00:14,412 --> 01:00:17,373
Boss, must we go this far?

769
01:00:17,456 --> 01:00:20,960
What'sÂ wrong with you?
Get going!

770
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:27,925
<i>That's how we crossed the line.</i>

771
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:30,178
You try casting the net.

772
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,572
<i>After that, your father Ahn Tae-su
became the quarry manager,</i>

773
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:57,246
<i>and your mother, who didn't know
anything, lived with him.</i>

774
01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:02,251
She lived a pitiful life.

775
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,630
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

776
01:01:09,383 --> 01:01:11,427
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

777
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:32,782
Hey, Wang-yong.

778
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:34,283
<i>I caught the Lecaf.</i>

779
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:36,994
<i>I calmed him down
and he talked.</i>

780
01:01:37,078 --> 01:01:40,540
<i>Mr. Bang ordered him
to fetch something from your home.</i>

781
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:52,760
The thing about nails is,

782
01:01:54,137 --> 01:01:57,348
you either pull it out
or smash it in.

783
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:03,646
This case is the latter.

784
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:10,153
<i>What? Mayor Chu?</i>

785
01:02:10,236 --> 01:02:12,613
Yeah, I think Chu made
my mom into the culprit.

786
01:02:12,697 --> 01:02:13,865
And Mr. Bang is with him too.

787
01:02:13,948 --> 01:02:16,742
<i>So, what your mom said was true?</i>

788
01:02:17,285 --> 01:02:19,370
Yeah, I need concrete evidence
from his past.

789
01:02:19,453 --> 01:02:21,205
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

790
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:23,166
Okay, Wang-yong,
I'm almost there so...

791
01:03:09,962 --> 01:03:13,341
My husband killed someone.

792
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:17,470
My husband is a killer.

793
01:03:18,596 --> 01:03:20,515
My husband killed someone.

794
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:25,144
He's a killer.

795
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:28,147
My husband killed someone.

796
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:31,651
My husband is a killer.

797
01:03:36,614 --> 01:03:38,950
<i>He's a killer.</i>

798
01:03:40,284 --> 01:03:43,371
<i>My husband killed someone!</i>

799
01:03:46,082 --> 01:03:47,917
Jung-in, are you okay?

800
01:03:48,584 --> 01:03:49,919
Yeah, I'm fine.

801
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:52,463
You said you received
something from him.

802
01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:58,427
It's nothing special,
a construction map.

803
01:03:58,511 --> 01:03:59,470
Take a look.

804
01:04:03,766 --> 01:04:06,269
Ahn Tae-su-> Bang / Ji

805
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:08,938
Mayor Chu Turned Dirt
Into Gold by Luring Casino,

806
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:10,648
Running for Governor!

807
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:19,907
Ahn Tae-su-> Bang / Ji

808
01:04:24,704 --> 01:04:25,997
What are you doing?

809
01:04:26,247 --> 01:04:29,292
Could you find security footage
of my accident

810
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:30,751
and scan the truck?

811
01:04:31,878 --> 01:04:33,296
Are you really okay?

812
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:41,554
I need a printout of the land registered
to the names written here.

813
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:46,225
Bang Seung-hyuk, Ji Young-deuk,
Hwang Bang-young, Choi Bong-su.

814
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:47,143
Thank you.

815
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,270
Purchaser: 1998 - Ahn Tae-su
2016 - Bang Seung-hyuk

816
01:04:58,613 --> 01:04:59,614
This bankbook?

817
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:00,531
Yes.

818
01:05:06,162 --> 01:05:07,747
I came to see Mayor Chu.

819
01:05:08,873 --> 01:05:11,125
Could you ask him?
It won't take long.

820
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:13,085
I'm sorry,
you can't go inside.

821
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:31,270
How are you feeling?

822
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:34,065
I came back from the dead,

823
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:37,068
I can't be good.

824
01:05:37,652 --> 01:05:40,947
I'm just worried that
I'm behind on my mayoral work.

825
01:05:41,614 --> 01:05:45,243
Indeed, from the casino
to your campaign,

826
01:05:45,827 --> 01:05:47,495
you must be busy.

827
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,960
What casino?

828
01:05:55,336 --> 01:05:57,630
Didn't that land
have greenbelt status?

829
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,135
It's nothing.

830
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:05,346
I'm sorry that this happened
at my home.

831
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:08,266
No need to apologize.

832
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:13,729
Did you meet my dad often
when he was alive?

833
01:06:13,855 --> 01:06:15,189
Mr. Ahn Tae-su?

834
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:19,986
I was busy with town work,
so not too often.

835
01:06:20,528 --> 01:06:22,697
How's your mother?

836
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:24,991
She's not well.

837
01:06:25,616 --> 01:06:28,953
Yeah? Aging is hard.

838
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:31,914
The older you get,
the harder it is for the children.

839
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:36,502
Could you actually
be our witness?

840
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:40,006
Witness? Sure, it's no trouble.

841
01:06:40,381 --> 01:06:44,886
But since I'm not well,
let's do it later.

842
01:06:46,554 --> 01:06:48,139
I knew you'd say that.

843
01:06:48,222 --> 01:06:51,476
What do you mean?
You knew what?

844
01:06:52,393 --> 01:06:55,688
My doctor won't let me leave.

845
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:58,065
I hope you recover quickly.

846
01:07:01,527 --> 01:07:02,528
See you again.

847
01:07:02,612 --> 01:07:03,654
Sure thing.

848
01:07:05,072 --> 01:07:06,032
Off you go.

849
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:17,126
I found the security footage.

850
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:20,922
The truck belongs to
Mr. Bang's construction company.

851
01:07:22,006 --> 01:07:23,132
I knew it.

852
01:07:23,216 --> 01:07:25,343
What about Mayor Chu?
Did he agree to be a witness?

853
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,803
No.

854
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:30,056
I'll have to force him.

855
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:38,356
They're far more cunning
than I thought.

856
01:07:42,527 --> 01:07:44,570
Just say what I heard and saw?

857
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:48,241
Please rise.
The judges are entering the court.

858
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:54,831
The pesticide found at
the defendant's house

859
01:07:54,914 --> 01:07:57,667
was purchased from
Mr. Jeon's shop.

860
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:05,883
Five years ago, he did tenant farming
on the village mayor's land.

861
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,802
He took them on credit.

862
01:08:08,678 --> 01:08:11,055
Did you know
the defendant's family well?

863
01:08:11,139 --> 01:08:13,391
They're my ex's family.

864
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,769
When he was shunned
by the entire village,

865
01:08:16,853 --> 01:08:20,439
I became his drinking buddy
even though I don't drink.

866
01:08:20,523 --> 01:08:22,859
What did you two talk about
over drinks?

867
01:08:23,275 --> 01:08:26,487
The times when he was
doing well,

868
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:29,282
but it always ended
with badmouthing others.

869
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:31,784
What happened?

870
01:08:33,244 --> 01:08:34,619
Mr. Ahn Tae-su...

871
01:08:35,705 --> 01:08:39,125
<i>was a big shot
when he headed the quarry.</i>

872
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:45,672
There aren't useful rocks
here anymore.

873
01:08:45,756 --> 01:08:46,882
Is that true?

874
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:51,761
Speaking of which,
I got a killer tip.

875
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:55,891
You know the mountain
in the next village over?

876
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:59,604
Gold was found there.

877
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:04,525
<i>He believed a geologist
and bought up the land</i>

878
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:08,196
<i>by pooling the villagers' money.</i>

879
01:09:08,446 --> 01:09:12,158
How much longer are we
gonna keep digging?

880
01:09:13,576 --> 01:09:15,912
You sure there's gold in there?

881
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:20,750
<i>After the gold digging scam,</i>

882
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,877
<i>he was after one last comeback.</i>

883
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:29,550
Sir, could you pass
the nomination to me?

884
01:09:29,634 --> 01:09:35,056
<i>He wanted to use all his connections
to get into politics.</i>

885
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:38,893
- How much more will you scam us?
- Let him go.

886
01:09:42,063 --> 01:09:43,355
Nomination Forfeit Agreement

887
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,234
You should've done this earlier.

888
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:48,985
Why get beat up for it?

889
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:54,199
<i>Everyone in the village shunned him.</i>

890
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:56,786
<i>Chu, Hwang and others</i>

891
01:09:56,869 --> 01:10:00,456
<i>stood by Mr. Ahn until the end.</i>

892
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:05,461
But they planned a betrayal.

893
01:10:08,339 --> 01:10:09,841
Where's Chu In-hwe?!

894
01:10:10,133 --> 01:10:12,343
Where is that bastard?!

895
01:10:13,052 --> 01:10:14,679
You son of a bitch!

896
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:17,056
You're campaigning instead of me?!

897
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,852
People here want me to,
what choice do I have?

898
01:10:21,519 --> 01:10:23,104
Son of a bitch!

899
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:26,023
You bastard!

900
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:29,318
Must be hurt.

901
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:32,280
Am I wrong?

902
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:37,702
Stop it before you look
even more pathetic.

903
01:10:40,746 --> 01:10:42,206
Game over.

904
01:10:50,381 --> 01:10:53,009
I'll kill you all with pesticide!

905
01:10:53,384 --> 01:10:57,096
Wait a minute,
kill them with pesticide?

906
01:10:57,513 --> 01:11:00,057
Yes, he always said that.

907
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:04,562
<i>Chu, Hwang, Ji, Bang and Choi,</i>

908
01:11:05,855 --> 01:11:10,776
these are all victims of spiked
rice wine at Mr. Ahn's funeral, right?

909
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,403
Looks like it.

910
01:11:12,695 --> 01:11:15,490
People in this village all quit drinking
for their health.

911
01:11:16,866 --> 01:11:19,744
They were the only drinkers in the village.

912
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:24,874
Did the defendant
and Mr. Ahn Tae-su know this?

913
01:11:25,249 --> 01:11:27,376
Of course, even I knew that.

914
01:11:28,211 --> 01:11:30,922
They always hung out
and drank together.

915
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:33,925
Your Honor,

916
01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:37,512
we request one of the survivors
of this case,

917
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:39,597
Mayor Chu In-hwe,
appear as our witness.

918
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:42,391
You made things worse
by not killing that bitch!

919
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,769
Look at this approval rating.

920
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:47,188
Approval rating is one thing,

921
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:49,565
but the public opinion is bad.

922
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:51,692
Don't talk back to me!

923
01:11:57,114 --> 01:12:01,077
I should've tossed her
in a mental hospital long ago.

924
01:12:02,036 --> 01:12:03,871
<i>Chu In-hwe, you bastard!</i>

925
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:05,665
Where is he?!

926
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:10,086
I know, you're the same
as Ahn Tae-su!

927
01:12:10,169 --> 01:12:12,839
Come to the police station,
let's go right now!

928
01:12:12,922 --> 01:12:14,757
What the hell did I do, woman?!

929
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:17,718
I know exactly what you did!

930
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:24,058
Everything's going to shit,
I'll have to set this right.

931
01:12:29,438 --> 01:12:32,108
So many of you came,
good day!

932
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:33,651
How do you know the defendant?

933
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:35,194
What is your current condition?

934
01:12:35,403 --> 01:12:37,780
Do you have anything to say
to the citizens of Daecheon?

935
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:58,176
Do you know 2004 Daecheon
Councillor Yoo Young-dae?

936
01:12:58,759 --> 01:13:00,011
Yoo Young-dae?

937
01:13:01,304 --> 01:13:02,597
I'm not sure.

938
01:13:03,514 --> 01:13:05,224
According to Mr. Jeon,

939
01:13:05,558 --> 01:13:09,770
you assaulted Yoo and obtained
his nomination forfeit agreement.

940
01:13:09,854 --> 01:13:10,897
Jeon said that?

941
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:15,067
Why did he talk
all that nonsense?

942
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:19,280
The assaulters usually don't remember
but the victims do.

943
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,950
Who's the victim?
Bring him here.

944
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:27,455
Mr. Ahn Tae-su threatened
the former councilman Councillor Yoo,

945
01:13:27,538 --> 01:13:30,875
and you were said to have
assaulted him during the nominations.

946
01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:34,420
So bring the victim.

947
01:13:35,046 --> 01:13:38,883
The defense is making speculations
based on nothing but hearsay.

948
01:13:39,258 --> 01:13:41,969
Allow me to make this
absolutely clear to you.

949
01:13:42,553 --> 01:13:47,225
I received my nomination fairly
and entered the election.

950
01:13:50,269 --> 01:13:52,939
Witness, is your wife's name
Lee Soon-ja?

951
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:54,357
Yes, that's correct.

952
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,656
This is Mr. Ahn's bankbook.

953
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:05,535
Your wife received $30,000
six months ago,

954
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:08,120
and $10,000 three months ago,

955
01:14:08,329 --> 01:14:09,705
could you explain that?

956
01:14:09,956 --> 01:14:15,378
I was told that she lent him
$30,000 for his liver transplant,

957
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:19,465
and he asked for
an additional $10,000.

958
01:14:19,549 --> 01:14:20,967
Is there an IOU?

959
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:23,761
My wife lent it to him
on good faith, so I'm not sure.

960
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,265
Of course there isn't,
because Mr. Ahn threatened you.

961
01:14:28,057 --> 01:14:29,058
Threatened?

962
01:14:30,226 --> 01:14:34,397
Lady, do I look like someone
who'd get threatened?

963
01:14:34,647 --> 01:14:37,817
Wasn't that to make up the loss
from selling his land?

964
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:42,905
Jesus, what are you talking about?

965
01:14:43,906 --> 01:14:48,244
As soon as Mr. Ahn's land was sold,
its greenbelt status was removed,

966
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,874
and casino construction plans
were revealed and someone profited.

967
01:14:53,916 --> 01:14:57,253
Who gave consent for the casino
to get built on greenbelt land?

968
01:14:59,881 --> 01:15:06,888
Whether someone profits or not,
what's that got to do with me?

969
01:15:08,181 --> 01:15:11,684
Did I own even 1 percent
of that greenbelt land?

970
01:15:12,768 --> 01:15:15,813
How did I profit
from this casino?!

971
01:15:17,315 --> 01:15:21,152
Witness, do not raise your voice.

972
01:15:23,696 --> 01:15:26,324
Wang-yong: I've arrived

973
01:15:29,076 --> 01:15:30,912
I'd like to request a new witness.

974
01:15:34,832 --> 01:15:36,375
We'd like to object.

975
01:15:36,459 --> 01:15:38,127
He's an unscheduled witness.

976
01:15:38,753 --> 01:15:43,049
He's a key witness who invaded
the defendant's home.

977
01:15:44,217 --> 01:15:47,970
He may be in danger
so we request a closed hearing.

978
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,442
The defense's request
for a closed hearing is approved.

979
01:16:01,526 --> 01:16:03,569
Please clear the courtroom.

980
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:06,906
We'll announce the next hearing separately.

981
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:11,828
Why did you even bring
a sick man here?

982
01:16:14,163 --> 01:16:17,917
You broke into Mrs. Chae's home, no?

983
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:21,337
Did you do it on your own
or did someone order you?

984
01:16:21,921 --> 01:16:24,757
Mr. Bang ordered me to.

985
01:16:25,591 --> 01:16:30,012
Bang is head of the construction company
where the witness works.

986
01:16:30,555 --> 01:16:31,764
For what reason?

987
01:16:33,266 --> 01:16:36,269
He said it was Mayor Chu's order.

988
01:16:36,352 --> 01:16:39,605
I was told to bring back
Ahn Tae-su's old land certificate.

989
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:44,652
Are these the documents
you were looking for?

990
01:16:45,236 --> 01:16:46,988
Yes, that's right.

991
01:16:47,196 --> 01:16:51,117
I kept a copy just in case
Mayor Chu changed his mind.

992
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,326
What do you mean?

993
01:16:52,702 --> 01:16:55,496
He promised me a spot
when the casino--

994
01:16:58,416 --> 01:16:59,667
I shouldn't have said that.

995
01:17:02,712 --> 01:17:05,047
In the convenience store
when the casino opens,

996
01:17:05,131 --> 01:17:06,382
but I didn't take the offer.

997
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:18,436
During the prosecution's investigation,
did you mention this document?

998
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:20,021
Yes, of course.

999
01:17:20,521 --> 01:17:23,399
But they shrugged it off
and told me to leave.

1000
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:25,485
Who was the prosecutor?

1001
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:28,905
Him.

1002
01:17:31,282 --> 01:17:32,492
That is all.

1003
01:17:34,452 --> 01:17:39,665
<i>Daecheon Mayor Chu, leading candidate
for governor was in court today...</i>

1004
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:43,461
I managed to find the part,
it's as good as new.

1005
01:17:44,212 --> 01:17:45,546
Forty-two dollars, please.

1006
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:47,465
Thank you.

1007
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:54,514
Find irrefutable,
consistent evidence!

1008
01:17:54,972 --> 01:17:56,933
If it's consistent enough,
it'll become the truth.

1009
01:17:57,016 --> 01:18:00,061
The truth can be a lie
with a small crack!

1010
01:18:04,148 --> 01:18:06,275
Sir, what should we do
with Ahn Jung-su?

1011
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:07,944
Attorney Ahn is waiting outside.

1012
01:18:24,502 --> 01:18:30,299
<i>Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you!</i>

1013
01:18:30,383 --> 01:18:33,344
<i>Happy birthday dear Ahn Jung-su!</i>

1014
01:18:34,512 --> 01:18:36,180
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

1015
01:18:41,269 --> 01:18:44,981
<i>Whenever I eat my wife's food,</i>

1016
01:18:45,356 --> 01:18:50,611
<i>my chest hurts
and I can't breathe.</i>

1017
01:18:54,365 --> 01:19:01,372
<i>Because of Choon-woo, she's gone crazy,
she's trying to kill me.</i>

1018
01:19:05,585 --> 01:19:06,794
Jung-su.

1019
01:19:11,549 --> 01:19:15,595
Who broke this phone?

1020
01:19:16,596 --> 01:19:17,805
Was it Mom?

1021
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:26,063
Why did she break it?

1022
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:31,235
I don't know.

1023
01:19:33,154 --> 01:19:34,572
Mom scares me.

1024
01:19:42,246 --> 01:19:44,165
Why did you cremate Ahn Tae-su?

1025
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:50,171
His body won't rot,
so I wanted him burned.

1026
01:19:50,379 --> 01:19:52,089
He deserves to be burned.

1027
01:19:59,388 --> 01:20:01,182
Do you remember these men?

1028
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,479
Bastards.

1029
01:20:06,938 --> 01:20:11,776
They're the same as Ahn Tae-su!
Goddamn trash!

1030
01:20:14,028 --> 01:20:17,615
Why? Did they kill someone?

1031
01:20:22,829 --> 01:20:25,331
You reported to the police
that your husband killed someone.

1032
01:20:30,086 --> 01:20:32,129
<i>Thirty thousand dollars isn't enough?</i>

1033
01:20:32,839 --> 01:20:34,507
It's not that.

1034
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:40,179
Choon-woo keeps showing up
in my dreams lately.

1035
01:20:42,932 --> 01:20:45,935
The statute of limitations
has all but passed.

1036
01:20:46,018 --> 01:20:47,603
You killed him,
I didn't do shit!

1037
01:20:47,812 --> 01:20:50,231
We all did it together.

1038
01:20:53,484 --> 01:20:56,487
What did you do to Choon-woo?!

1039
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,323
What did you do to him?!

1040
01:20:59,657 --> 01:21:00,741
What's the matter?!

1041
01:21:01,075 --> 01:21:05,204
Tell me! Say it again!

1042
01:21:07,248 --> 01:21:11,002
Knowing what he did,
Ahn deserved to die!

1043
01:21:14,589 --> 01:21:21,262
Because of Choon-woo, she's gone crazy,
she's trying to kill me.

1044
01:21:32,482 --> 01:21:34,275
What the hell are you doing?!

1045
01:21:55,087 --> 01:21:56,339
For the table over there.

1046
01:22:18,653 --> 01:22:24,951
<i>Choon-woo, all this was
because of Lim Choon-woo?</i>

1047
01:22:26,786 --> 01:22:30,122
Sleep a little more,
I'll be back shortly.

1048
01:22:34,752 --> 01:22:38,005
<i>He had a good heart.</i>

1049
01:22:39,006 --> 01:22:43,553
<i>It tears me up
just thinking about it.</i>

1050
01:23:43,654 --> 01:23:45,239
Why did you do that?!

1051
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:47,783
What about the baby?!

1052
01:23:49,535 --> 01:23:52,580
If I keep my mouth shut,
no one will know!

1053
01:23:53,706 --> 01:23:58,002
I'll raise her as my own,
I give you my word,

1054
01:23:58,711 --> 01:24:00,963
so live with me!

1055
01:24:06,969 --> 01:24:08,429
<i>You lived with Ahn Tae-su</i>

1056
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,600
<i>because of</i>

1057
01:24:13,935 --> 01:24:15,895
<i>Choon-woo's daughter?</i>

1058
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:21,651
<i>I was scared because
I had nothing.</i>

1059
01:24:22,652 --> 01:24:27,824
I had no family.
I had nobody to look after me.

1060
01:24:29,242 --> 01:24:32,453
So scared of leaving for somewhere.

1061
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:41,921
But I wanted to save my daughter.

1062
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,802
My baby, Jung-in...

1063
01:24:48,886 --> 01:24:50,555
Jung-in...

1064
01:24:53,766 --> 01:24:56,811
But I didn't get to protect her.

1065
01:24:58,521 --> 01:25:00,857
<i>I just couldn't.</i>

1066
01:25:02,733 --> 01:25:07,113
<i>Imagine her pain
that led her to slit her wrist.</i>

1067
01:25:09,448 --> 01:25:12,160
<i>I pretended not to know until then.</i>

1068
01:25:13,202 --> 01:25:17,874
<i>I'm the bitch, I deserve to die.</i>

1069
01:25:20,918 --> 01:25:27,925
A child just needs her mother
in the toughest of times.

1070
01:25:29,635 --> 01:25:32,889
<i>But I couldn't protect
my own child.</i>

1071
01:25:34,182 --> 01:25:39,187
<i>I didn't recognize
my child's pain.</i>

1072
01:25:41,564 --> 01:25:46,152
<i>I'm the bitch, I deserve to die.</i>

1073
01:25:48,154 --> 01:25:49,530
<i>I couldn't protect her...</i>

1074
01:25:49,614 --> 01:25:51,073
Jung-in!

1075
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:53,993
Jung-in!

1076
01:26:54,428 --> 01:26:56,013
My daughter...

1077
01:26:59,308 --> 01:27:00,810
Jung-in.

1078
01:27:04,564 --> 01:27:05,773
Mom.

1079
01:27:20,413 --> 01:27:22,290
Why are you crying?

1080
01:27:28,462 --> 01:27:30,047
I'm sorry.

1081
01:27:31,507 --> 01:27:32,967
Jung-in...

1082
01:27:35,678 --> 01:27:37,972
I'm sorry.

1083
01:27:38,723 --> 01:27:40,183
Mom...

1084
01:27:40,475 --> 01:27:43,769
I'm sorry that I left
without you.

1085
01:27:44,145 --> 01:27:46,814
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:27:53,905 --> 01:27:55,406
Baby,

1087
01:27:57,408 --> 01:27:59,410
are you all right?

1088
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:11,047
Where am I?

1089
01:28:14,926 --> 01:28:17,011
What happened to me?

1090
01:28:19,472 --> 01:28:24,894
I don't know
how this happened

1091
01:28:25,686 --> 01:28:27,271
or where we are.

1092
01:28:30,066 --> 01:28:33,861
What do I do?
What am I to do?

1093
01:28:34,904 --> 01:28:36,864
Don't cry, baby.

1094
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,996
If you're all right,
then I am too.

1095
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,000
Don't worry about me
and look after yourself.

1096
01:28:49,418 --> 01:28:56,425
I'm so lost, Mom.

1097
01:28:58,344 --> 01:29:00,763
What do I do?

1098
01:29:02,098 --> 01:29:05,893
Mom, what do I do?

1099
01:29:07,186 --> 01:29:10,857
Tell me what to do.

1100
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,697
What do I do, Mom? Tell me...

1101
01:30:37,276 --> 01:30:40,696
What was the witness looking for
at the defendant's home?

1102
01:30:40,947 --> 01:30:43,157
Or was he trying to
destroy something?

1103
01:30:45,618 --> 01:30:48,496
You can see the names
of the owners as of 2018.

1104
01:30:48,746 --> 01:30:52,333
This land used to belong to
the defendant's husband Ahn Tae-su.

1105
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,504
But to pay for his
liver cirrhosis treatment,

1106
01:30:56,587 --> 01:31:00,716
he sold it to Bang and Ji in 2016
at a bargain price.

1107
01:31:01,843 --> 01:31:05,054
Then the witness removed
its greenbelt status,

1108
01:31:05,138 --> 01:31:08,224
and with the casino moving in,
the land value shot up.

1109
01:31:08,307 --> 01:31:14,230
Your Honor, the defense is continuing
her irrelevant line of questioning.

1110
01:31:17,108 --> 01:31:18,234
Lady,

1111
01:31:19,402 --> 01:31:22,989
you got a memory problem,
or do you not have a point?

1112
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:27,910
My name is not mentioned
on that map at all.

1113
01:31:29,954 --> 01:31:32,665
If there's even a slight
conflict of interest,

1114
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:36,127
I'll take full responsibility
as the mayor.

1115
01:31:38,087 --> 01:31:40,047
Will you swear by it?

1116
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:41,299
I absolutely will.

1117
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:46,429
Everything I did was
for the love of Daecheon.

1118
01:31:48,848 --> 01:31:51,934
If that's a crime,
I'll take the punishment.

1119
01:31:54,979 --> 01:31:56,189
You're right.

1120
01:31:56,272 --> 01:31:59,567
The witness has not profited
from the casino deal.

1121
01:32:00,985 --> 01:32:05,448
I discovered that there is
irrefutable evidence from this 1998 map

1122
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,825
that Ahn kept until his death.

1123
01:32:10,369 --> 01:32:14,624
Lee Soon-yim, Lee Soon-bok,
Lee Chang-seok, Lee Dong-seok.

1124
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:18,169
Witness, do you know them?

1125
01:32:19,295 --> 01:32:22,548
They're your wife's family members.

1126
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:28,054
How much did you invest
in the gold mine in the past?

1127
01:32:28,137 --> 01:32:28,971
What?

1128
01:32:31,015 --> 01:32:33,392
Well, that's...

1129
01:32:33,851 --> 01:32:35,061
You won't remember.

1130
01:32:35,144 --> 01:32:37,313
Because the gold mine never existed.

1131
01:32:39,857 --> 01:32:43,861
The geologist who spread rumors
of a gold mine was your wife's cousin,

1132
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:47,865
and your wife's family
made an incredible fortune

1133
01:32:47,949 --> 01:32:51,369
by selling useless land
to Ahn Tae-su and the villagers.

1134
01:32:53,746 --> 01:32:55,790
Certified ownership transfer register
1998->2016->2018

1135
01:32:55,873 --> 01:32:58,835
Could you still say that you
have not profited from this land?

1136
01:32:59,961 --> 01:33:02,046
Didn't Ji, Bang and DL Construction

1137
01:33:02,296 --> 01:33:06,759
give you election funds
on the condition of the casino permit?

1138
01:33:06,843 --> 01:33:07,844
You son of a bitch!

1139
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,512
Chu In-hwe, you bastard!

1140
01:33:11,055 --> 01:33:12,515
- How dare you!
- You'll be punished!

1141
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:14,976
Silence!

1142
01:33:21,732 --> 01:33:23,151
Lady,

1143
01:33:24,485 --> 01:33:26,445
what kind of novel
are you writing here?

1144
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:30,533
I'm the victim.

1145
01:33:31,576 --> 01:33:36,706
I was poisoned and almost died
at your father's damn funeral!

1146
01:33:36,914 --> 01:33:40,626
Witness, mind your manners
in the courtroom.

1147
01:33:41,502 --> 01:33:44,714
Jung-in! Are you kidding with me?

1148
01:33:46,215 --> 01:33:50,094
That happened 20 years ago!
How dare you...

1149
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,680
You brought out
a sick man for this?!

1150
01:33:54,015 --> 01:33:55,808
I'm looking for a murder suspect.

1151
01:33:56,642 --> 01:33:59,187
Lim Choon-woo,
don't you remember?

1152
01:34:06,694 --> 01:34:11,866
The actual murderer is Tae-su Ahn,
the defendant's husband.

1153
01:34:13,868 --> 01:34:16,662
The deceased Ahn Tae-su?

1154
01:34:19,081 --> 01:34:20,374
Yes, that's right.

1155
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:25,505
After the gold mine scam,
Ahn was in living hell.

1156
01:34:26,631 --> 01:34:30,009
But when he found out that
it was part of Mayor Chu's scheme,

1157
01:34:30,885 --> 01:34:34,263
he soon lost his life
to liver cirrhosis.

1158
01:34:35,431 --> 01:34:40,853
And he put pesticide
in the rice wine before death.

1159
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:47,985
As expected, Chu, Hwang,
Ji, Bang and Choi drank it,

1160
01:34:48,444 --> 01:34:51,656
and three are dead,
and two are hospitalized.

1161
01:34:53,616 --> 01:35:00,414
We'd like to add Ahn Tae-su
as the prime suspect of this case.

1162
01:35:00,498 --> 01:35:05,002
He expected his own death, and planned
to kill people at his own funeral?

1163
01:35:05,753 --> 01:35:08,589
This is a preposterous
and delusional story!

1164
01:35:10,591 --> 01:35:13,136
This is an analysis report
from the forensics.

1165
01:35:14,971 --> 01:35:18,599
Methomyl, which was found
on the defendant's clothes,

1166
01:35:18,683 --> 01:35:21,018
was also found on
Ahn Tae-su's clothes.

1167
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:31,654
We'll rule on the validity of the evidence
at the final hearing.

1168
01:35:39,579 --> 01:35:42,540
Are the accusations
uncovered in the trial true?

1169
01:35:42,623 --> 01:35:44,208
Tell us the truth!

1170
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:46,419
Is Councillor Yoo complicit in this?

1171
01:35:46,502 --> 01:35:49,005
- One comment please!
- What is the truth?

1172
01:35:49,088 --> 01:35:50,423
Tell us the truth!

1173
01:35:56,554 --> 01:35:59,265
Bang, you're under arrest for perjury
and conspiracy to commit murder.

1174
01:35:59,348 --> 01:36:02,435
<i>Mayor Chu's bid for governorship
is on shaky ground as...</i>

1175
01:36:02,518 --> 01:36:04,353
What are you doing?

1176
01:36:04,437 --> 01:36:05,605
Stop that.

1177
01:36:07,565 --> 01:36:09,817
<i>The police are looking into
any illegal election contributions.</i>

1178
01:36:09,901 --> 01:36:12,111
<i>Mayor Chu may not run for governor.</i>

1179
01:36:39,138 --> 01:36:40,348
Jung-su,

1180
01:36:42,892 --> 01:36:46,395
could I ask you a favor?

1181
01:36:50,483 --> 01:36:53,694
Dad asked me to
give it to them, as a present.

1182
01:36:55,071 --> 01:36:57,073
The rice wine pot was the present?

1183
01:36:58,074 --> 01:36:59,992
When Dad's in heaven,
there'd be a party.

1184
01:37:00,451 --> 01:37:02,662
He said to give it
to the man on TV.

1185
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:08,584
Is this the man on TV?

1186
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:11,546
Yes!

1187
01:37:12,964 --> 01:37:15,675
This man bad, very bad!

1188
01:37:19,262 --> 01:37:20,638
That is all.

1189
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:24,142
We'll now hear from the defendant.

1190
01:37:50,376 --> 01:37:51,502
Defendant,

1191
01:37:53,296 --> 01:37:54,922
where are we?

1192
01:38:00,344 --> 01:38:01,512
I don't know.

1193
01:38:03,431 --> 01:38:05,099
Where is this?

1194
01:38:07,393 --> 01:38:08,853
Who am I?

1195
01:38:11,147 --> 01:38:12,690
I don't know.

1196
01:38:18,446 --> 01:38:23,159
I'll ask again, who am I?

1197
01:38:32,585 --> 01:38:34,962
I don't know.

1198
01:38:36,547 --> 01:38:39,342
But you sure are pretty.

1199
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:44,055
I've got a daughter like you.

1200
01:38:44,305 --> 01:38:48,768
She went to Seoul National University Law.
She's pretty.

1201
01:38:49,727 --> 01:38:53,564
Her name is Ahn Jung-in.

1202
01:38:56,442 --> 01:39:00,404
I haven't seen her in so long.

1203
01:39:02,949 --> 01:39:08,621
I feel bad because
I couldn't do anything for her.

1204
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:14,585
I wonder if she's eating well,

1205
01:39:15,044 --> 01:39:17,547
if she's sick,

1206
01:39:19,173 --> 01:39:21,676
if she's got a boyfriend.

1207
01:39:24,512 --> 01:39:26,806
I miss her so much.

1208
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,814
I'll ask you again,

1209
01:39:36,941 --> 01:39:38,442
who am I?

1210
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:48,786
I really don't know.

1211
01:39:50,288 --> 01:39:52,290
I'm sorry.

1212
01:40:11,601 --> 01:40:16,439
The defendant beside me
is my mother.

1213
01:40:19,775 --> 01:40:21,861
But she doesn't even
recognize her daughter.

1214
01:40:23,696 --> 01:40:29,285
She dedicated her life to her family
and ended up with dementia.

1215
01:40:31,954 --> 01:40:35,500
For this reason, she can be
excessively emotional

1216
01:40:36,876 --> 01:40:39,045
and prone to arguments.

1217
01:40:40,713 --> 01:40:43,341
But it is not fair
to assume that

1218
01:40:43,424 --> 01:40:47,053
her arguments led her
to plan and execute murders.

1219
01:40:49,055 --> 01:40:52,683
To be innocent, there can't be
any reasonable doubt.

1220
01:40:53,476 --> 01:40:57,271
All the evidence presented by
the prosecution was circumstantial,

1221
01:40:57,355 --> 01:40:59,273
leaving room for reasonable doubt.

1222
01:41:03,236 --> 01:41:05,822
But the defendant's husband
Ahn Tae-su is different.

1223
01:41:09,784 --> 01:41:15,039
He had a clear motive
and his own son witnessed it.

1224
01:41:19,585 --> 01:41:24,590
The defense insists on
Chae Hwa-ja's innocence,

1225
01:41:25,508 --> 01:41:29,470
and declares that Ahn Tae-su
is the prime suspect.

1226
01:41:36,644 --> 01:41:42,358
I'll now read the verdict
of case 2017-363.

1227
01:41:43,317 --> 01:41:49,407
To obtain a conviction in a criminal trial,
there has to be irrefutable evidence,

1228
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:55,663
but all evidence presented against
the defendant was circumstantial.

1229
01:41:56,205 --> 01:42:01,502
In addition, new evidence presented
by the defense concerning Ahn Tae-su

1230
01:42:01,586 --> 01:42:05,464
has to be verified
by the prosecution in the future.

1231
01:42:06,632 --> 01:42:08,885
Verdict is as follows:

1232
01:42:08,968 --> 01:42:12,972
Defendant Chae Hwa-ja
is not guilty.

1233
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,287
Are you certain
Ahn Tae-su is the perpetrator?

1234
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:38,581
How do you feel
about winning this trial?

1235
01:42:58,351 --> 01:42:59,936
Let me ask you something.

1236
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:06,651
Do you really think
your mother is innocent?

1237
01:43:10,404 --> 01:43:15,284
She has already been punished.

1238
01:43:18,246 --> 01:43:19,121
Jung-in!

1239
01:43:42,478 --> 01:43:49,235
<i>Sitting in the flower bed</i>

1240
01:43:50,862 --> 01:43:57,410
<i>Watching the petals</i>

1241
01:43:59,328 --> 01:44:06,335
<i>Where did this pretty color</i>

1242
01:44:08,045 --> 01:44:10,548
<i>Come from?</i>

1243
01:44:11,841 --> 01:44:18,848
<i>Such a beautiful flower</i>

1244
01:44:19,223 --> 01:44:22,435
<i>Flower</i>

1245
01:44:23,895 --> 01:44:30,485
<i>Such a great day</i>

1246
01:44:31,027 --> 01:44:36,407
<i>What a great day</i>

1247
01:44:36,491 --> 01:44:39,952
Mom, is that the only song
you know?

1248
01:44:42,371 --> 01:44:45,374
Why do you always
sing that here?

1249
01:44:46,042 --> 01:44:49,420
It's a day for you and me
to remember.

1250
01:44:49,504 --> 01:44:50,755
Remember what?

1251
01:44:51,923 --> 01:44:58,930
When you grow up,
I'll tell you.

1252
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,391
How much bigger?

1253
01:45:02,642 --> 01:45:04,352
This big?

1254
01:45:04,435 --> 01:45:06,145
It's nothing like that.

1255
01:45:07,063 --> 01:45:09,941
Later, when your heart gets bigger.

1256
01:45:10,233 --> 01:45:11,734
That's dumb.

1257
01:46:40,072 --> 01:46:44,660
Innocence
