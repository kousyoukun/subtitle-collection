{66}{298}Out of the musical Hall of Fame|"The Big Ten," a tune that has|captured the fancy of the nation...
{299}{375}On a mild summer afternoon in 1936,
{376}{457}a three-year-old thoroughbred|named Seabiscuit
{458}{575}was saddled up for a cheap stakes|race at Boston's Suffolk Downs.
{576}{691}The purse was a paltry $700.
{758}{864}The colt was a direct descendant|of the legendary Man O'War -
{865}{963}- but you'd never have|known it to look at him.
{964}{1054}Dung-colored, stocky, and|low-slung, with knobby,
{1055}{1144}asymmetrical knees that didn't|quite straighten all the way,
{1145}{1271}he was a masterpiece of|faulty construction.
{1272}{1371}He'd been raced an astonishing|thirty-five times as a two-year-old,
{1372}{1575}more than triple the average|for a horse his age -- and|he'd lost nearly every time.
{1576}{1744}But now, as he ambled past|the grandstand, he caught the|eye of one of the spectators,
{1745}{1848}a veteran horse trainer named Tom Smith.
{1849}{1967}HILLENBRAND: Smith nodded at the horse|and the horse nodded back at him,
{1968}{2110}and (Smith) later said it was|kind of as if the horse was|paying an honor to notice him,
{2111}{2289}and the pony boy tugged the|horse on his way, and Smith|said, "I'll see you again."
{2290}{2402}Despite his appalling record, Smith|saw something special in the colt.
{2403}{2535}"He had a look," the trainer said|later, "of true confidence."
{2536}{2725}Smith's employer, an ex-bicycle|repairman turned automotive magnate|named Charles Howard, saw it too.
{2726}{2869}A few weeks later, he bought|Seabiscuit for the|bargain-basement price of $8,000,
{2870}{3031}and sent him west with|Smith, to the Detroit|Fairgrounds racetrack to train.
{3032}{3119}The stablehands in the|Howard barn were skeptical.
{3120}{3227}None of them had ever seen|such an equine catastrophe.
{3228}{3345}The colt paced in his stall, broke into|a lather at the sight of a saddle,
{3346}{3431}and lunged at anyone who|dared to go near him.
{3432}{3566}When he ran, his left foreleg|jabbed out wildly, as|if he were swatting flies.
{3567}{3725}Horsemen called it "an eggbeater|gait" -- and most considered|it a sign of lameness.
{3726}{3798}But Tom Smith knew what he was doing.
{3799}{3907}A man so laconic that a reporter once|suspected he'd removed his tongue,
{3908}{4023}Smith had little patience|for people or their opinions.
{4024}{4106}[But] horses he understood.
{4107}{4189}FARRELL JONES, Former|Jockey: I think all he ever|thought about was a horse.
{4190}{4236}Silent Tom is what they called him.
{4237}{4296}Phuh -- he'd do that -- phuh, phuh.
{4297}{4418}But I don't know that he was|aware he'd do it; I don't|think that...no, he do that.
{4419}{4505}I'd see him -- phuh, phuh|-- do that quite a bit.
{4506}{4541}He was a great horse trainer.
{4542}{4656}He was a dedicated guy; to|what he did and that was it.
{4657}{4828}Smith made a careful study of|Seabiscuit, then devised a regimen targeted|to the colt's specific problems.
{4829}{4946}For nerves, an assortment of|soothing animal companions -
{4947}{5132}- a spotted dog with enormous|platter-like ears, and an amiable|yellow cow-pony named Pumpkin.
{5133}{5236}For leg soreness: daily applications|of a homemade liniment.
{5237}{5332}And finally, a diet|consisting of a high-quality,
{5333}{5496}calcium-rich strain of timothy|hay which had to be special-ordered|from Northern California.
{5497}{5599}The stablehands were instructed to|give Seabiscuit maximum latitude -
{5600}{5768}- and, most importantly, to never, ever|disturb him while he was sleeping.
{5769}{5893}HILLENBRAND: Most horses can|only sleep on the ground for|about five minutes at a time
{5894}{5973}because their bodies are so enormous,
{5974}{6038}and they're configured in such a way|that breathing becomes difficult.
{6039}{6231}Seabiscuit was the exception. He|would sleep and sleep and sleep.
{6232}{6409}Gradually, Seabiscuit relaxed and|rounded into form -- but he still|didn't show much interest in running.
{6410}{6537}Smith wondered where he|would ever find a jockey|sensitive enough to handle him.
{6538}{6648}As it happened, the jockey found him.
{6649}{6766}His name was John Pollard -- but thanks|to a shock of flame-colored hair,
{6767}{6834}most people called him "Red."
{6835}{6900}NORAH CHRISTIANSON, Red Pollard's|Daughter: He was very, very charming.
{6901}{7006}He had a face, kind of a leprechaun-ish|face and he -- he was not short.
{7007}{7216}He was about 5'6. And that is tall|for a jockey...very thin, sinewy.
{7217}{7287}Like a dancer.
{7288}{7509}He quoted Shakespeare at great length|and he carried around several|books of poems everywhere he went.
{7510}{7626}I think he was capable of|being a great many things.
{7627}{7792}My father went to the fourth|grade and a teacher told him that|he wouldn't amount to anything.
{7793}{7958}And I think that, uh, that|rode him all his life.
{7960}{8060}One of seven children born to|a bankrupt brick manufacturer,
{8061}{8150}Pollard had left home at fifteen|in the care of a guardian -
{8151}{8283}- who then promptly abandoned|him at a makeshift|racecourse in Butte, Montana.
{8284}{8408}He'd spent the next dozen|years kicking around the|country's lowliest tracks,
{8409}{8579}talking his way onto as many mounts|as he could and working as a|prizefighter to make ends meet.
{8580}{8710}Pollard drifted onto the Detroit|Fairgrounds one afternoon in July 1936,
{8711}{8824}with twenty-seven cents and|a few sugar cubes in one|pocket, and in the other,
{8825}{8951}a half-pint of a cheap brandy|he called "bow-wow wine."
{8952}{9103}HILLENBRAND: Red Pollard had been at|a racetrack where his last mount had|simply refused to finish his race.
{9104}{9205}He had a six percent winning average,|which is horrendous for a jockey.
{9206}{9374}He would have taken any mount that|day, and he went to every single barn|on the track No one would hire him,
{9375}{9530}and he went into the last barn,|and Tom Smith gestures to the stall,|says, "I've got a horse here."
{9531}{9662}CHRISTIANSON: When they first|met, he talked to the horse and|the horse responded positively,
{9663}{9725}which this horse did not usually do,
{9726}{9924}and Tom Smith being a very astute|judge of man and beast he knew there|was something there...some affinity.
{9925}{9976}A connection.
{9977}{10023}HILLENBRAND: Pollard put|his hand in his pocket,
{10024}{10096}pulled out a sugar cube and|held it out to the horse.
{10097}{10181}And the black muzzle touched|the jockey's shoulder.
{10182}{10476}It was the first affectionate thing|Seabiscuit had done to anybody and|Tom Smith thought "this is my man."
{10477}{10594}Red Pollard had spent his career|at bad racetracks on bad horses.
{10595}{10644}The worst animals on the circuit.
{10645}{10765}He understood troubled horses.
{10820}{10974}He was not a guy you would|put on a great racehorse,|but this is the one he fit.
{10975}{11144}So, he wasn't a great jockey,|but the moments he was on|Seabiscuit, he was great.
{11145}{11280}Separately, they were nothing|more than a failing jockey|and a broken down horse.
{11281}{11490}Together, they would become hard|luck heroes for a troubled nation.
{12041}{12217}In the lean days of the Depression,|thoroughbred racing was fast|becoming America's most popular sport.
{12218}{12387}Bans on wagering, passed at the|turn of the century, had mostly|been lifted by the late 1920's -
{12388}{12597}- and revenue-hungry states|across the country had|rushed to relegalize racing.
{12598}{12677}Bookie shouting numbers.
{12678}{12777}SMITH: The opportunities for gambling|in the 1930s were very limited.
{12778}{12825}There were no state lotteries.
{12826}{12893}Football was a very minor sport.
{12894}{13039}You wanted to bet on a|prize fight you had to go|find a bookie or something.
{13040}{13147}There were casinos in Nevada,|but how many people go to Nevada,
{13148}{13345}hence the only place you could|really bet was at a race track.
{13362}{13446}JACK WHITAKER, Sportscaster: I|expect it was a release the|dream of making a lot of money,
{13447}{13562}which was in everybody's|head in those days.
{13563}{13645}And I would think that it was an|escape for them like the movies were,
{13646}{13872}radio was escape, because it was kind|of a brutal times people went to the|races six days a week in those days-
{13873}{14017}-twenty thousand, forty thousand people.
{14138}{14353}By the fall of 1936, Tom Smith|still didn't know if his gamble on|Seabiscuit would ever pay off.
{14354}{14458}One afternoon, he put an exercise|rider on the colt's back,
{14459}{14658}pulled out his stopwatch, and|shouted to turn Seabiscuit loose.
{14738}{14789}The horse came rolling|down the backstretch,
{14790}{14922}his body flattening out with|each stride, his speed building.
{14923}{15043}By the time he blew by|Smith, he was covering more|than fifty feet a second -
{15044}{15161}- and still picking up steam.
{15191}{15270}HILLENBRAND: He kept thinking|the horse couldn't|possibly be going this fast,
{15271}{15313}and the horse went under the wire,
{15314}{15463}and he clicked the stopwatch, and|the horse had crushed the track|record, and this was in a workout.
{15464}{15575}Horses rarely run as fast in|workouts as they do in real races,
{15576}{15740}and Smith knew what he had on his|hands and he had an opportunity here|to conquer the racing world and -
{15741}{15978}- and to make history, and|he knew he had to do|everything right with this one.
{16100}{16223}The first event on Seabiscuit's|schedule was the annual|Governor's Handicap in Detroit -
{16224}{16342}- a small-time event with|a big local following.
{16343}{16509}Among the 28,000 spectators in|the stands that afternoon were|Charles Howard and his wife Marcela,
{16510}{16688}who'd driven out from California|to see what their new|horse and his jockey could do.
{16689}{16875}At 5:39pm, the starter bell rang.|One minute and fifty seconds|later, with the crowd on its feet,
{16876}{16984}Seabiscuit crossed the|wire first by a nose.
{16985}{17123}In the time it takes to fry|an egg, he'd recouped over|half of his purchase price.
{17124}{17191}"This Seabiscuit. . .|runs like he means it,"
{17192}{17363}sportswriter Jolly Roger exclaimed,|"... with fire, slash and zam."
{17364}{17496}Over the next twelve weeks, as|Seabiscuit thundered to the|winner's circle again and again -
{17497}{17650}- some insiders were touting|him as "a dangerous contender"|for the Santa Anita Handicap,
{17651}{17763}the signature event at|California's brand new racetrack.
{17764}{17874}The $100,000 Santa Anita|Handicap brings out California's|biggest racing crowd.
{17875}{17939}Movie stars on every hand|for the world's richest race.
{17940}{18007}HILLENBRAND: It was the probably the|richest sporting event in the world.
{18008}{18077}One hundred thousand dollars|-- all to the winner.
{18078}{18119}A massive amount of money.
{18120}{18269}This is the time when the|average American is earning|less than $500 a year.
{18270}{18363}On the afternoon of February 27th, 1937,
{18364}{18519}a record crowd of sixty thousand|spectators turned out for the|third annual Santa Anita Handicap -
{18520}{18618}- better known as "the hundred-grander."
{18619}{18791}Despite his recent victories, most|professional odds makers still|considered Seabiscuit a long shot.
{18792}{18857}The smart money was on Rosemont -
{18858}{19018}- the lightning-fast five-year-old|that had recently trounced|1935's Triple Crown winner.
{19019}{19252}Nearly $400,000 was riding on|the contest -- an all-time|betting high for western racing.
{19253}{19326}There they go...
{19327}{19415}The entire field broke at once,|in a mad dash for position.
{19416}{19516}Here on the outside comes|Rosemont in a good position...
{19517}{19626}For the next half-mile,|Pollard patiently threaded|Seabiscuit through the pack,
{19627}{19705}before finally tucking in|behind the front-runner.
{19706}{19789}One half a mile...
{19790}{19861}Rosemont, meanwhile, was|on the move from behind,
{19862}{19973}darting in and out of the field,|inching up on the outside.
{19974}{20040}Seabiscuit is now moving up...
{20041}{20182}At the top of the home stretch,|Seabiscuit swung into the lead|with Rosemont hard on his heels.
{20183}{20360}NEWREEL: Seabiscuit has got the|lead and the battle's on and it's|anybody's race right til the end
{20361}{20481}HILLENBRAND: It looked like he|had it they were running down|midstretch with a clear lead,
{20482}{20544}and Red Pollard kind of froze.
{20545}{20678}This was the biggest moment|in his career, and he|stopped urging the horse.
{20679}{20820}For fifteen strides he just sat|there and he started slowing down.
{20821}{20875}With only a fifty yards to go,
{20876}{21067}Pollard suddenly snapped into|action and dropped the whip|across Seabiscuit's flank.
{21068}{21174}The two horses hurtled|under the wire together.
{21175}{21259}A photo finish, all eyes turn|upward to the photo booth.
{21260}{21466}An eternity for those who anxiously|await the outcome -- down the|slender wire to the judges platform,
{21467}{21532}closely determine the|microscopic difference...
{21533}{21665}The winner was Rosemont, by a nose.
{21670}{21810}HILLENBRAND: Red Pollard got off the|horse, and could see that everyone|was looking at him with accusation.
{21811}{21904}Why had he stopped riding|the horse for 15 strides?
{21905}{21940}He had blown the race.
{21941}{22071}From everyone's perspective it|was inexplicable what he had done.
{22072}{22199}I think the reason why Red|stopped riding was that he|couldn't see Rosemont coming.
{22200}{22331}Rosemont was to his outside, and|Red was blind in his right eye.
{22332}{22393}At the beginning of his career,
{22394}{22489}he was struck in the back of|the head with something kicked|up by another horse's hooves.
{22490}{22635}It hit his head right over|the visual center of his brain|and blinded him in one eye.
{22636}{22779}So he couldn't tell how|close he was cutting it.
{22780}{22923}He, he rode right into|the pack with one eye.
{22924}{23022}And he kept it secret his|closest friends didn't know it.
{23023}{23145}If he had admitted he was blind in|one eye the stewards would rightly|have banned him from the track,
{23146}{23193}and he never would have ridden again.
{23194}{23221}It was the only life he knew.
{23222}{23492}It was the only thing he wanted|to do, so he had to just let people|criticize him and say nothing.
{23493}{23630}The furor over Pollard's mistake|made Seabiscuit a local celebrity.
{23631}{23735}Had it not been for his jockey,|west coast sportswriters insisted,
{23736}{23837}the horse would have surely|run off with a hundred grand.
{23838}{23930}But the adulation was|far from universal.
{23931}{23981}In the prestigious racing|circles of the East,
{23982}{24084}most racetrackers still regarded|Seabiscuit with skepticism -
{24085}{24190}- if not outright scorn.
{24564}{24628}WHITAKER: Always the|Eastern people would sneer
{24629}{24747}"Oh-he's a California horse," and|for many years they were right!
{24748}{24940}Because it was the Eastern|horses cleaning up on the|Triple Crown races anyway.
{24941}{25106}If eastern horsemen wanted proof|of Seabiscuit's mettle, Charles|Howard meant to give it to them.
{25107}{25293}On March 13th, 1937, he packed|his horse off on an exhaustive|cross-country racing campaign.
{25294}{25436}"Seabiscuit will take on all|comers," he told the press, "and|he'll mow them down like grass."
{25437}{25472}Seabiscuit took them all on.
{25473}{25623}Back and forth he|shuttles...from train to track
{25624}{25814}That summer and fall, the|eastern racing establishment dined|almost exclusively on crow.
{25815}{25987}Shipping an unheard-of 8,000|miles, Seabiscuit blazed to|victory in ten major stakes races,
{25988}{26104}boosting his total earnings for|the year to 144,000 dollars -
{26105}{26244}-more than the world's top|money-winner had earned|in his best season ever.
{26245}{26340}Sports-loving fans have|found an idol and backed|Seabiscuit to the limit...
{26341}{26441}But he did not win the coveted|title of Horse of the Year.
{26442}{26531}That honor went to an|eastern-bred three-year-old,
{26532}{26661}the son of Man O'War and only|the fourth horse in history|to win the Triple Crown.
{26662}{26770}His name was War Admiral.
{26936}{27021}Imperious and tempermental|like his legendary sire,
{27022}{27221}War Admiral was infamous for throwing|wild tantrums in the starting gate.
{27222}{27349}But in a race, he was breathtaking.
{27350}{27432}There's not a colt today can|catch the Admiral's flying heels.
{27433}{27493}And it's War Admiral by four lengths!
{27494}{27590}War Admiral didn't run -- he flew.
{27591}{27700}On the oval, no other horse|ever got close to him.
{27701}{27834}But some racing fans believed|Seabiscuit just might.
{27835}{27953}All turfdom wants to know if Seabiscuit|can beat the great War Admiral...
{27954}{28124}If Seabiscuit were going to|claim the turf championship, he'd|have to dethrone War Admiral.
{28125}{28275}One of the century's greatest|sports rivalries had begun.
{28276}{28405}The match-race fit right in with|Howard's plan to make Seabiscuit a star.
{28406}{28567}But War Admiral's notoriously|cantankerous owner, Samuel|Riddle, refused to commit.
{28568}{28652}He had no intention of demeaning|his horse's reputation,
{28653}{28773}he told reporters, in a|contest against a western colt.
{28774}{28899}So the Howard barn returned|to California to prepare|for the next best thing:
{28900}{28983}another go at the Santa Anita Handicap.
{28984}{29137}This time, they vowed,|Seabiscuit would win.
{29149}{29270}But as the race drew near,|their confidence began to wane.
{29271}{29381}Days of drenching rains turned the|track to a swamp, and Seabiscuit -
{29382}{29545}- never at his best in the|mud -- was scratched from|one warm-up after another.
{29546}{29659}Finally, a restless Pollard|opted to ride a race without him,
{29660}{29797}climbing aboard Howard's star|filly, Fair Knightess, instead.
{29798}{29883}It was a decision he|would come to regret.
{29884}{30022}Halfway around the turn, Fair|Knightess clipped the heels of the|horse in front of her and tumbled,
{30023}{30233}pitching Pollard over her head|and crushing him beneath her|as she thudded to the ground.
{30234}{30314}JONES: That mare just fell|and fell on him and fell|like, lucky he did kill him.
{30315}{30393}I mean you take a horse that|weighs a thousand pounds and,
{30394}{30538}and it lays on you a little|bit an...you ain't gonna last.
{30539}{30691}Pollard's diagnosis was grim: a|shattered collarbone, a broken shoulder,
{30692}{30808}multiple rib fractures and|serious internal injuries.
{30809}{30912}The doctors said he wouldn't|ride again for at least a year.
{30913}{31121}The hundred-grander -- and|his chance to redeem the loss|to Rosemont -- was gone.
{31122}{31265}HILLENBRAND: During his time in|the hospital, it tortured him to|not be out there with the horse.
{31266}{31373}This was a very unfortunate man;|he was a very tormented man.
{31374}{31486}And was more star-crossed|than any athlete I know of.
{31487}{31673}CHRISTIANSON: I do think|there is a real lure to living|your life all the way up,
{31674}{31736}which is what Hemingway said,
{31737}{31863}only bullfighters live their|lives all the way up and he|meant by that that every day,
{31864}{32036}every day they face death, and it|does put an edge to things, you|know, and I think he had to have that.
{32037}{32141}That defined him, that was what he was.
{32142}{32237}Three days later, his|left arm in traction,
{32238}{32350}Pollard made it clear that|there was only one jockey|who could replace him -
{32351}{32467}- his old friend George Monroe Woolf.
{32468}{32502}LEONARD DORFMAN,Trainer: They|called George "the Iceman"
{32503}{32610}because he could sit chilly on|a horse as long as anybody.
{32611}{32678}I thought he was perfection|in motion, really.
{32679}{32751}To watch (George Woolf) ride,|really to watch him coming|down the stretch on a horse,
{32752}{32800}boy he, he looked beautiful to me.
{32801}{32960}Uh, I don't know whether he|was helping the horse,|but he sure looked like it.
{32961}{33213}SMITH: A great jockey is a|genius. What a jockey needs to|do is have supreme balance.
{33247}{33493}He has to have the fingers of a great|pianist in order to sense through the|reins what the horse is capable of.
{33494}{33622}The jockey through his knees|senses what the horse is doing.
{33623}{33804}The only part of the jockey that never|touches anything is the part that|should normally go into the saddle.
{33805}{33971}When to whip. When to hold back.|To go inside. To go outside.
{33972}{34166}To go through an opening this big where|your elbows brush the jock next to|you at forty something miles an hour,
{34167}{34460}and your stirrups clang against his|stirrup, all of this a 110 pound|man on top on a 1200 pound horse.
{34463}{34566}It's a thing of beauty.
{34584}{34648}HELEN LUTHER Red Pollard's|Friend: To be behind a horse|and have all the dirt and mud
{34649}{34753}and everything else in your face|going through on the inside,
{34754}{34845}of course, that's|dangerous -- it took nerve.
{34846}{34964}Or else, no sense. I used to|say, 'No brains, no fear.'
{34965}{35220}They had a joke about, riders who,|you know, were a little skittish...and|if they'd ever be on the outside,
{35221}{35354}they'd say, 'Oh yes, he took|the married man's route.'
{35355}{35526}Off the track, a jockey's existence|was marked by the constant,|grueling struggle to make weight.
{35527}{35615}The limit hinged on the|ranking of the mount -
{35616}{35773}- the better the horse, the higher|the weight he was assigned to carry,|the heavier the jockey could be.
{35774}{35928}But even the best horses seldom|carried a rider who tipped the|scales at more than 114 pounds.
{35929}{36132}If a jockey wanted to ride with|any kind of regularity, he had|to whittle down to at least 110.
{36133}{36272}SMITH: Weight can stop a freight|train is an old race-track expression.
{36273}{36347}Two or three pounds is|over the assigned weight.
{36348}{36398}It means that the horse, before|he comes out of the gate,
{36399}{36501}he's lost several lengths because|he's got to tote that extra weight.
{36502}{36601}Jockeys can't expect to make a|living if they're gonna eat well.
{36602}{36703}As a matter of fact, some time|ago, I was talking to a|very famous jockey and I said,
{36704}{36848}'What are you going to do when you|retire,' and he said, 'Eat lunch.'
{36849}{36983}The thermometer reads a hundred and|forty, but Billy Passmore lies under|a blanket -- too much breakfast.
{36984}{37136}And Bobby Stevenson is compensating|for a couple of hamburgers|he just couldn't resist.
{37137}{37236}George Woolf weighed in at 115 pounds -
{37237}{37394}- five less than the|recently-crowned Miss America,|but hefty by turf standards.
{37395}{37565}While lighter jockeys rode more|than a thousand races a year, Woolf|averaged fewer than two hundred.
{37566}{37723}But his winning-average was so high|that he still ranked among the|best money-riders in the country.
{37724}{37828}Not surprisingly, Woolf was|confident about the hundred-grander.
{37829}{37938}He even made Pollard a|promise: when Seabiscuit won,
{37939}{38119}they'd split the jockey's $10,000|share right down the middle.
{38120}{38239}Sportfolio 1938 and the $100,000|Santa Anita handicap is off
{38240}{38336}and running with 18 top thoroughbreds|streaking past the grand stands.
{38337}{38451}The famous Seabiscuit jams his|way through the bunch as he starts|his drive toward the leaders.
{38452}{38537}But Stagehand plods along steadily|on the outside getting positioned
{38538}{38600}for one of the greatest stretch|duels in handicap history.
{38601}{38719}Seabiscuit and Stagehand hook the|pace together and it boils down|to a thrilling two horse race.
{38720}{38777}Seabiscuit on the inside,|Stagehand on the outside,
{38778}{38970}neck and neck to the wire but|in the last jump it's Stagehand|in a fantastic photofinish.
{38971}{39086}Even though he'd lost the hundred-grander|for the second time in a row,
{39087}{39262}Seabiscuit had turned in one of|the most dazzling performances in|the history of thoroughbred racing.
{39263}{39446}Fouled early by a hopeless longshot,|he'd catapulted from twelfth|place to first in just half a mile,
{39447}{39595}only to wind up in fierce|homestretch drive against a horse|toting thirty fewer pounds.
{39596}{39730}And still, he'd only lost by a nose.
{39748}{39978}DORFMAN: The best race I've ever seen|a horse run was the day that Stagehand|beat him in the Santa Anita Handicap.
{39979}{40126}Seabiscuit is back about ninth, now|Georgie Woolf has got him clear and|trying to fight his way through there...
{40127}{40201}DORFMAN: This horse, with|130 pounds on his back,
{40202}{40381}spotting the other horse 30|pounds and making that big|move to pass all those horses
{40382}{40470}...and go to the front...
{40471}{40566}and then have Stagehand come|running at him like he|was gonna run right by him
{40567}{40624}and then Seabiscuit just took off
{40625}{40751}And now there goes Seabiscuit|going to the front, but|look out for Stagehand...
{40752}{40822}JONES: It was unbelievable to|me this day, what happened.
{40823}{40916}He kept running; he kept running even|after he got away from the trouble.
{40917}{41039}He did that. He was phenomenal.
{41094}{41186}The Mighty Biscuit loses...
{41187}{41211}What about Seabiscuit?
{41212}{41245}Shut off I think when the gate went up.
{41246}{41268}Gave him a bad start...?
{41269}{41286}Yes.
{41287}{41407}Ran a great race after that...
{41480}{41609}"Now that all the hullabaloo|on the handicap has died|down," one turf scribe wrote,
{41610}{41758}"the time has come to assert|that Seabiscuit was|the best horse in the race."
{41759}{41926}It was an opinion that would be|voiced over and over again, in newspapers|from Syracuse to Sacramento.
{41927}{42128}Never before had a race horse been|so widely praised for losing.
{42170}{42225}SMITH: You have a downtrodden,
{42226}{42495}Charlie Chaplinesque figure who|comes out of the mire and the sorry|exploitation of the little man.
{42496}{42610}Probably there are people who|thought to themselves I'm|making twenty dollars a week,
{42611}{42724}it's enough to support my family,|but I could lose my job tomorrow,
{42725}{42864}but maybe someday I'll come back|and be the great guy I always was|destined to be, look at Seabiscuit.
{42865}{42918}He did it.
{42919}{43041}All across the country, people|who'd never even been to|a racetrack caught the fever.
{43042}{43152}One sportswriter called|it "Seabiscuit-itus."
{43153}{43201}HILLENBRAND: He drew enormous crowds.
{43202}{43323}People would crowd by the railroad|tracks when he went across the country.
{43324}{43426}In little remote towns people would|crowd up next to the train to see
{43427}{43471}if they could get a|little glimpse of him.
{43472}{43592}Can you get a little closer...
{43688}{43788}HILLENBRAND: He was merchandised|to a phenomenal degree.
{43789}{43868}There were Seabiscuit ladies'|hats sold on Fifth Avenue.
{43869}{43926}There were at least five|Seabiscuit board games.
{43927}{43974}There was a Seabiscuit pinball machine.
{43975}{44031}He had his own line of oranges.
{44032}{44145}He endorsed dry-cleaning services|and hotels, absolutely everything.
{44146}{44193}He was a superstar.
{44194}{44251}He would have been a|superstar in any era,
{44252}{44388}but he came along at a time|when America was desperate|for inspiring heroes.
{44389}{44464}Heroes that looked like America.
{44465}{44513}It's a new track record|for the mile and an eighth
{44514}{44722}as Seabiscuit shoves his whiskers|for the home plate just enough|to hit the handsome jackpot.
{44723}{44757}Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,
{44758}{44870}this is Ken Carpenter greeting|you from Santa Anita racecourse|in Arcadia California...
{44871}{44921}Seabiscuit gets a big hand.|I can see them applauding...
{44922}{45068}Seabiscuit carries his top weight|of 133 lbs. to a spectacular|victory in record shattering time...
{45069}{45173}HILLENBRAND: At the beginning|of his career about half the|people in America had radios.
{45174}{45291}By the end of it virtually|everybody did, and there were|eight million sets in cars
{45292}{45356}Seabiscuit is standing very quietly...
{45357}{45440}HILLENBRAND: Seabiscuit raced during|the racing season about once a week,
{45441}{45588}so it became an American|ritual to gather around the|radio and listen to him run
{45589}{45714}and it has a lot to do with|why he became such a|huge celebrity in America.
{45715}{45800}He was one of the first big radio stars.
{45801}{45893}This is the National|Broadcasting Company...
{45894}{46018}In the Spring 1938, Seabiscuit|made headlines almost every day,
{46019}{46173}as breathless sportswriters broke|the news that the Howard bay|would at last meet his arch-rival,
{46174}{46310}War Admiral, in a full-field|race at Boston's Suffolk Downs.
{46311}{46475}All over the country, magazines and|newspapers featured side-by-side|photographs of the celebrity horses,
{46476}{46625}offering endless comparisons of their|relative size and speed and merits.
{46626}{46733}Sportswriters furiously polled|fans for their predictions,
{46734}{46878}and composed lengthy editorials on|the likely outcome of the race.
{46879}{47009}"I am one of the narrow minded|group which has seen War Admiral run|too often," one columnist wrote,
{47010}{47174}"to concede Seabiscuit a chance|for anything better than a|seat in Congress this year."
{47175}{47270}SMITH: People looking at War|Admiral saw a magnificent horse.
{47271}{47360}Good looking. Came from an|illustrious background.
{47361}{47425}He came from an aristocratic barn.
{47426}{47659}Seabiscuit doesn't have that|long elegant, aristocratic|wide-eyed look of eagles.
{47660}{47797}He looked like he ought to|be drawing a cart with|ice behind it some place.
{47798}{47981}Seabiscuit's fans hailed him as|a plain working man, a|proletarian, a modern Horatio Alger.
{47982}{48155}"He'll take that fancy little|War Admiral," one predicted,|"and curl him into a pretzel."
{48156}{48312}Six days before the race,|a fully recovered Pollard|did an old friend a favor
{48313}{48393}and agreed to work his|green two-year-old colt.
{48394}{48518}Halfway around the oval, the horse|spooked, crashed through the rail,
{48519}{48597}and tore off in the|direction of the barns.
{48598}{48697}As he tried to cut between two|sheds, he skidded sideways,
{48698}{48836}smashed into a corner,|then crumpled in a heap.
{48837}{48941}At the far end of the shed|row, they heard the screams.
{48942}{49106}Pollard's right leg had been nearly|severed just below the knee.
{49107}{49201}CHRISTIANSON: The pain was|excruciating, excruciating.
{49202}{49328}He had such a lot of bad|luck with regards to spills.
{49329}{49430}And my father would get so|enraged if you ever said,
{49431}{49536}if anyone ever said, you know|that he fell off a horse.
{49537}{49628}He would say, I don't fall|off horses. I was thrown!
{49629}{49685}LUTHER: I don't know how|he held himself together.
{49686}{49760}Especially when they tore his leg open -
{49761}{49791}- when the bones were fractured.
{49792}{49867}Oh, I don't know how he stood it.
{49868}{49982}All through that summer, Pollard|lay in bed in a Boston hospital,
{49983}{50081}reading Emerson while surgeons|fretted over his leg.
{50082}{50226}They twice rebroke and reset it, but|the splintered bones would not heal.
{50227}{50319}His body shriveled to a|scant eighty-six pounds.
{50320}{50428}The doctors told Pollard|he would never ride again.
{50429}{50525}CHRISTIANSON: I think he was|immensely, deeply disappointed,
{50526}{50606}like one of the great|disappointments in his life,
{50607}{50766}but I think he had a perspective|on all that, through philosophies|of the writers that he read.
{50767}{50964}He would always say this|comes from Shakespeare "Sweet|are the uses of adversity,"
{50965}{51139}As summer turned to fall,|adversity's uses took shape in|the person of Agnes Conlon,
{51140}{51242}Pollard's private duty nurse.
{51243}{51398}The daughter of a well-to-do|Boston antique dealer, she was|educated, refined, reserved -
{51399}{51489}- Red's opposite in almost every way.
{51490}{51580}She was also already spoken for.
{51581}{51665}Pollard was smitten enough not to care.
{51666}{51816}One afternoon, he looked up|from his poetry and asked|nurse Conlon to marry him.
{51817}{52004}To the horror of her status-conscious|family, Agnes said yes.
{52005}{52107}CHRISTIANSON: Her parents looked|askance at her going to marry my father,
{52108}{52247}as if he were out of the circus|or something strange like that.
{52248}{52437}And ah, a long time later, I|learned from an aunt, she said
{52444}{52532}"you know, none of us|wanted her to marry him.
{52533}{52696}We just didn't think that|he was worthy of her."
{52769}{52829}Millions of racing fans|in America and abroad
{52830}{52942}look anxiously toward the|richest match race in the history|of the sport of kings...
{52943}{53096}By the fall of 1938, the|Seabiscuit--War Admiral|match-up had been rescheduled.
{53097}{53322}They would meet, one-on-one,|November 1st at Maryland's|Pimlico Racecourse.
{53323}{53434}"The whole country is divided|in two camps,"the San|Francisco Chronicle observed.
{53435}{53540}"People who never saw a horserace|in their lives are taking sides.
{53541}{53646}The crowd makes War Admiral|an odds-on favorite.
{53647}{53702}George Woolf had signed|on to ride Seabiscuit -
{53703}{53830}- and for the first time in his|career, he wasn't sure he would win.
{53831}{53933}The night before the race, he'd|even called Pollard for advice.
{53934}{54064}His instructions had been|simple, if highly unorthodox.
{54065}{54210}Gun Seabiscuit at the start,|he told Woolf, and then|let War Admiral catch up.
{54211}{54286}"Once a horse gives Seabiscuit|the old look-in-the-eye,"
{54287}{54432}Pollard said, "he begins to|run to parts unknown..."
{54433}{54527}Thirty thousand people filled|the grandstand that afternoon.
{54528}{54616}Another ten thousand|jammed into the infield.
{54617}{54742}Outside the track, ten thousand more|gathered ten-deep around the fence,
{54743}{54886}and scrambled up tree limbs|and telephone poles as|far as a mile from the start.
{54887}{54996}HALL: I was in the Grandstand.
{54997}{55124}And if I can recollect, distinctly,|I was squeezed in, because|that's how many people were there.
{55125}{55221}I was squeezed in just around the|3/16 pole, where the horses broke.
{55222}{55306}It was so enthralling. It|was a two horse extravaganza.
{55307}{55389}I mean, they had built the|race to an outstanding pitch.
{55390}{55547}Everybody knew what was coming...|that... particular.. day.
{55548}{55574}I mean it was in the air.
{55575}{55651}It ... it engulfed you, I|mean, it was just like,|man it's about to happen.
{55652}{55715}Waiting for the bell to ring.
{55716}{55857}Down at the paddock gate, the|announcer Clem McCarthy began to|make his way to the radio booth,
{55858}{55936}but the crowd was so thick|he couldn't get through.
{55937}{56037}Ladies and Gentlemen I found it|impossible to get through this|enormous throng at Pimlico today -
{56038}{56098}- the first that time I've ever|failed to do that from the paddock...
{56099}{56257}So he climbed up on the track's outer|rail, down by the wire, and settled|in to call the race from there.
{56258}{56333}Across the country,|forty million listeners -
{56334}{56486}- one out of every three Americans|-- tuned in to the broadcast.
{56487}{56536}ARCHIVAL CLEM MCCARTHY: And they're off!
{56537}{56678}It's a go, Georgie Woolf is at the|whip on Seabiscuit to key him up and|they're coming to me head and head.
{56679}{56721}War Admiral on the inside.
{56722}{56804}Woolf is fighting [riding?] Seabiscuit|and Seabiscuit is outrunning him.
{56805}{56923}Seabiscuit is coming to me one|length - two lengths in the lead.
{56924}{57007}And he came right over 2|lengths, he goes by me.
{57008}{57077}Seabiscuit by two lengths, War|Admiral right on his heels.
{57078}{57133}War Admiral is trailing|him around the turn.
{57134}{57183}Seabiscuit on the lead by 2 lengths .
{57184}{57253}War Admiral is second to him|and Kurtsinger is sitting still.
{57254}{57302}Now War Admiral is|trying to move to him.
{57303}{57388}They're going into the backstretch.|Seabiscuit by a length and a half.
{57389}{57449}Now Seabiscuit by two|lengths , War Admiral second.
{57450}{57554}Seabiscuit by 2 lengths - they're|going up 3/4 of a mile to come.
{57555}{57631}And it's Seabiscuit by a length|and a half, down the backstretch.
{57632}{57723}They're halfway down that|backstretch and there goes|War Admiral after him.
{57724}{57832}Now the horse race is on!
{57853}{57957}They're head and head and now War|Admiral has a head advantage and|Seabiscuit's got a head advantage.
{57958}{58067}They're going into that far turn,|head and head, and it is either one
{58068}{58136}This is a real horse race, just|what we had hoped we'd get.
{58137}{58200}They're head and head|and both jockeys driving.
{58201}{58256}It's the best horse from here in.
{58257}{58292}They've 200 yards to come.
{58293}{58328}It's horse against horse.
{58329}{58361}Both of them driving.
{58362}{58532}Seabiscuit leads by a length. Now|Seabiscuit by a length and a half.
{58533}{58580}Woolf has put away his whip.
{58581}{58650}Seabiscuit by three;|Seabiscuit by three.
{58651}{58824}Seabiscuit is the winner!|By four lengths! And you|never saw such a wild crowd.
{58825}{58919}Seabiscuit's the|winner! By four lengths.
{58920}{59014}Trying to drown this crowd out|here. They're roaring around me.
{59015}{59081}Seabiscuit was the winner from|end to end. By four lengths.
{59082}{59158}Seabiscuit's final time|blazed across the tote board.
{59159}{59259}No horse in Pimlico's history had|ever run the distance so fast.
{59260}{59422}"Speed of that kind." one turf|scribe said, "is what is known|as kissing the boys good-bye."
{59423}{59530}It's a hero's reception.|Seabiscuit, undisputed|king of thoroughbreds.
{59531}{59635}He rewards his backers with|six dollars and forty|cents for each two dollars,
{59636}{59706}and that's certainly worth|a blanket of flowers...
{59707}{59841}"Seabiscuit did just what I|thought he'd do," Pollard told|a columnist the next day,
{59842}{59983}"He made a rear admiral|out of War Admiral."
{59984}{60130}When it came time, a few weeks|later, for reporters to cast their|ballots for Horse of the Year,
{60131}{60234}there was no debate over|which one deserved the honor.
{60235}{60464}"The Biscuit," sportswriter Bill|Corum wrote, "turn[s] out to be|the kind that Momma used to make."
{60465}{60610}Just six weeks later,|Seabiscuit's career seemed over.
{60611}{60681}On February 14th, 1939,
{60682}{60841}as he swung around the final|turn of a prep race at Santa|Anita, Seabiscuit stumbled.
{60842}{60935}His left foreleg suddenly giving way.
{60936}{61044}His suspensory ligament|had been ruptured.
{61045}{61163}It was likely that he|would never run again.
{61164}{61247}Howard was crushed.
{61248}{61302}But he refused to use|the word "retirement."
{61303}{61487}He took his horse home to his|California ranch for what|he called "a nice, long rest."
{61488}{61584}In April, Pollard arrived with Agnes.
{61585}{61701}He was flat broke, and had no|home to offer his new wife.
{61702}{61783}Graciously, the Howards took them in.
{61784}{61898}For a third time, his leg|had been broken and reset.
{61899}{62014}He hobbled along now, and|drank to dull the pain.
{62015}{62238}"[Seabiscuit and I] were a couple|of old cripples together,"|Pollard later said, "all washed up."
{62239}{62380}Throughout the summer of 1939, horse|and jockey convalesced together -
{62381}{62504}- taking long, limping walks,|pushing a little farther each day.
{62505}{62603}By September, they|were up to five miles.
{62604}{62786}"Out there among the hooting|owls," Pollard later remembered,|"we both got sound again."
{62787}{62993}CHRISTIANSON: I think that my father|found a solace in watching this|horse come back and grow strong,
{62994}{63166}and I think in some ways, well Seabiscuit|became his role model in a way.
{63167}{63266}If he can do it, I can kind of thing.
{63267}{63396}Late that fall, Charles Howard made|an extraordinary announcement.
{63397}{63468}On March 2nd, 1940,
{63469}{63610}seven-year-old Seabiscuit would|take one last stab at the race|that had so far eluded him,
{63611}{63688}Santa Anita's hundred-grander.
{63689}{63768}But there was no mention of|who would be in the saddle.
{63769}{63917}"If Red breaks that leg again," Howard|said, "he'll be crippled for life."
{63918}{64014}Still, Pollard insisted he|was fit enough to ride.
{64015}{64134}"Old Pops and I have four good legs|between us," he told a close friend.
{64135}{64221}"Maybe that's enough."
{64222}{64336}CHRISTIANSON: He didn't go to|Howard and say 'Please let me ride|Seabiscuit in this handicap.'
{64337}{64458}But Howard had doubts about|the condition of his leg and|a friend of my father's said,
{64459}{64631}'Maybe it's better to have|a man break his leg, than|to break a man's heart.'
{64632}{64727}Finally, Howard made his decision.
{64728}{64846}Pollard would ride Seabiscuit|in the Santa Anita Handicap.
{64847}{64969}On race day, Red came into the|paddock just before four o'clock.
{64970}{65103}Around his neck hung a medal|of St. Christopher that|Agnes had given him for luck.
{65104}{65201}He wasn't too proud to|admit he needed it.
{65202}{65294}Eyes of the turf world are|on Santa Anita and the comeback|of the great Seabiscuit.
{65295}{65374}Twice, he's lost the|$100,000 handicap by a nose.
{65375}{65514}Now, if those valuable pins can stand|the gaff today, he'll try again.
{65515}{65650}As Smith hoisted him into the saddle,|Pollard felt his confidence return.
{65651}{65754}"You know the horse and the horse|knows you," Smith whispered.
{65755}{65844}"Bring him home."
{65866}{66019}For Pollard, it would|all come down to that.
{66099}{66202}Exactly one minute and thirty-six|seconds after the bell rang,
{66203}{66301}he found himself bottled up at the|top of the homestretch, with|Seabiscuit straining at the reigns.
{66302}{66382}There was no way around|the frontrunners.
{66383}{66542}Finally, at the far turn, a|lane opened barely wide enough|for the horse to get through.
{66543}{66708}Pollard leaned forward in the|saddle and shouted, "Now, Pop!"
{66709}{66852}At the touch of the whip,|Seabiscuit broke through|and exploded into the lead.
{66853}{67069}He and Pollard scorched down the|stretch and under the wire all alone.
{67150}{67280}Seabiscuit had clocked the|fastest mile-and-a-quarter|in Santa Anita's history,
{67281}{67376}the second-fastest ever|run on an American track,
{67377}{67508}and had surpassed the world|money-winning record by|more than 60,000 dollars.
{67509}{67642}Some called it the greatest comeback|in the history of American sports.
{67643}{67861}"Oh," wrote columnist Jolly Roger,|"that I have lived to see this day."
{67889}{68082}In the winner's circle, Pollard|sat straight-backed on his horse,|his red hair matted with sweat.
{68083}{68170}Beneath him, Seabiscuit was still,
{68171}{68400}calmly munching the flowers|from his victory wreath as|dozens of camera bulbs flashed.
{68401}{68572}"Don't think," Pollard said later,|"he didn't know he was the hero."
{68573}{68777}SMITH: He suffered career-ended|injuries and surmounted them,|he ran until a very advanced age,
{68778}{68906}and he was ridden by a jockey who|suffered calamitous accidents,
{68907}{68990}who somehow pulled himself together...
{68991}{69086}Two crippled old men who|go out in a blaze of glory
{69087}{69167}and do great things and|to a depression-ridden,
{69168}{69377}anxious, frightened nation, it must|have come like a great sunrise.
{69419}{69582}CHRISTIANSON: I think that my|father understood that it was just|by chance that he became famous.
{69583}{69709}So many millions have talent or beauty,
{69710}{69774}and they haven't been in the|right place at the right time,
{69775}{69935}they haven't drifted into an arena|where they could be appreciated.
{69936}{70004}I think he knew that very deeply.
{70005}{70102}That it was all luck.
{70103}{70360}I think that together Seabiscuit|and he made a whole, a|comet, a star, a ball of light.
{70427}{70538}HILLENBRAND: There is something|quintessentially American|about everyone in this story.
{70539}{70668}About the ability to|triumph over hardship -
{70669}{70768}- that's the journey, that's the|journey toward the American dream.
{70769}{70817}This country was built on that.
{70818}{70893}And he embodies that|more than anybody else.
{70894}{71033}He is an extraordinary story that way.
