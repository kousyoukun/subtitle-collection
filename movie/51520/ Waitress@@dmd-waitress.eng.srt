What?

00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,149

from the hell of unwanted pregnancy.

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,688
I don¡¯t need no baby.
I don¡¯t want no trouble.

15
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,090
I just want to maKe pies.

16
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,163
That¡¯s all I want to do, maKe pies.

I thought you weren¡¯t sleeping
with your husband no more.

18
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,258
He got her drunK one night.

19
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,299
I should never drinK.

20
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,834
I do stupid things
when I drinK,

21
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,698
liKe sleep with my husband.

22

- Oh, no!
- (gasps)

23
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,001
LooKs liKe a pinK line
is forming. Shit.

24
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,039
One line or two lines?

25
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,335
One line or two lines?

26
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,875
Two lines! The control line
and the other line,

27
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,172
- the bad line, the ¡°¡°yes¡¯¡¯ line.
- Let me see that now.

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,078
Two lines, two definite lines.
There¡¯s no mistaKing them.

00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,549
- (KnocKing on door)
- MAN: What¡¯s going on in there?

30
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,711
We have customers!
Where are my waitresses?

31
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,516
Hold your balls straight, Cal.
Jenna ain¡¯t feeling well.

32
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,681
CAL:
What¡¯s wrong with her?

33
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,554
It¡¯s none of your business,
you blowhard.

34
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,150
I¡¯m fine, Cal!
We¡¯ll be right out.

35
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,228
CAL: Hurry up!

36
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:19,963
(sighs)

37
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,533
Hon, you oKay?

38
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,465
Shh. I¡¯m inventing a new pie

39
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,832
in my head.

40
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,635
Tomorrow¡¯s blue plate special.

41
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,233
I¡¯m calling it
¡°I Don¡¯t Want

42
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,370
Earl¡¯s Baby Pie.¡¯¡¯

43
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
I don¡¯t thinKwe can write that
on the menu board, hon.

44
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,583
Then I¡¯ll just call it
¡°¡°Bad Baby Pie.¡¯¡¯

45
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,653
What¡¯s in it, honey?

46
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:46,453
It¡¯s a quiche of egg and Brie cheese
with a smoKed ham center.

47
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,720
Sounds good, baby.

48
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,991
I ain¡¯t never going to get
away from Earl now.

49
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,862
(hard rocK playing)

50
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,398
You going to tell him?

51
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,337
I¡¯m not sure.

52
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,172
If my plan comes true and I
can maKe my big escape from him

53
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,712
in a couple months,
maybe he never even has to Know.

54
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,509
Are you sure it¡¯s his child?

55
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,481
You Know everything I do.
I ain¡¯t never cheated.

56
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,516
- Ah...
- I¡¯d never do that.

57
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,052
- Eh...
- I feel sorry for you,Jenna.

58
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,745
I mean, I¡¯d do anything

59
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,187
to meet a man, and BecKy¡¯s
husband is a senile fruitcaKe.

60
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,124
- Dawn!
- Well, I¡¯m sorry, it¡¯s true.

61
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,558
But now here you are,

62
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,721
married to this handsome guy.

63
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,729
Who¡¯s got very good hair.

64
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,163
Who¡¯s got very good hair.

65
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,234
And pregnant with

66
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,699
a little girl.

67
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,791
How do you Know it¡¯s a girl?

68
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,871
- We don¡¯t Know it¡¯s a girl.
- But neither of us

69
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,940
would trade places with you for
one second.

70
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,804
Now would we, BecKy?

71
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,171
No, we wouldn¡¯t, Dawn.
No, we wouldn¡¯t.

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,246
Except,just once in my life,

73
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,507
I¡¯d liKe to be able to maKe

74
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,582
a pie half as good

75
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,241
as Jenna can maKe a pie.

76
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,875
- Yeah, me, too.
-J ENNA: Oh, come on.

77
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,749
So what if I can maKe a decent pie?

78
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,584
- Who cares?
- LooK at this,Jenna.

79
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,023
As you can plainly see,
my right boob is much higher

80
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,185
than my left boob

81
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,353
and Dawn here has

82
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,589
pasty, pasty sKin.

83
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,394
I¡¯m stucK in a marriage
to Droolin¡¯ Phil the Invalid,

84
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,798
and Dawn eats TV dinners alone,

85
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,426
but still, we wouldn¡¯t
rather be you.

86
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,029
I do have pasty, pasty sKin.

87
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,475
( car horn blaring)

88
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,240
Yeah, I Know, you¡¯re here.

89
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,043
See you tomorrow, honey.

90
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,082
Good lucK.

91
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,481
- And if you do tell him you¡¯re...
- Shh!

92
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,313
Hey.

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,853
Hey.

95
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,216
BECKY: Hiya there, Earl.

96
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,488
We all just agreed that your hair
is super attractive.

97
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,653
Hooray for you.

98
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,094
- Woo-hoo!
- Woo-hoo!

99
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,330
I don¡¯t care if she is a pie genius.

100
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,339
I wouldn¡¯t trade places with her.

101
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,205
No, me neither.

102
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,608
(hard rocK playing)

103
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,081
You don¡¯t looK happy to see me.

104
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,446
Are you happy to see me?

105
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,883
Yeah, I¡¯m happy to see you.

106
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,112
Even brought you a piece

107
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,485

¡°¡°KicK In The Pants Pie.¡¯¡¯

108
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,579
Cinnamon spice custard.

109
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,921
You don¡¯t give me a Kiss.

110
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,864
Well, give me one.

111
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,258
There. That¡¯s more liKe it.

112
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,893
Where¡¯s that money

113
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,129
you made today?

114
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,296
Right here in my pocKet.

115
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,896
Well, now, hand it over.

116
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,307
Not much here, is there?

117
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,141
Slow day, you Know.

118
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,147
Yeah, you been having
more and more of those.

119
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,116
I¡¯m really not sure it¡¯s worth
you worKing there anymore.

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,210
I thinK I might rather have you
be at home

121
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,754
maKing me pies all day long.

122
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,982
( chucKling)

123
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,557
You didn¡¯t asK me

124
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,955
how my day was.

125
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,958
How was your day?

126
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,993
AsK me liKe you

127
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,790
care about it.

128
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,457
How was your day, Earl?

129
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,832
Well, you Know,
Johnson¡¯s on my case again,

130
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,599
about the mortgages and everything.

131
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,608
But I don¡¯t maKe the banK policy,
and I told him that,

132
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,440
- but he doesn¡¯t listen.
- (hard rocK fades)

133
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,174
- (dreamy lullaby plays)
-J ENNA: ¡°I Hate My Husband Pie. ¡¯¡±

134
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,716
You take bittersweet chocolate
and don¡¯t sweeten it.

135
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,342
You make it into a pudding

136
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,148
and drown it in caramel.

137
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,745
- (hard rocK resumes)
- You¡¯re not listening to me.

138
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,823
Yeah, I am.

139
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,016
What I say?

140
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,184
You were bitching about Mr.Johnson.

141
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,524
What were the exact words I said?

142
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,188
Well, I mean, I can¡¯t repeat
them verbatim...

143
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,199
You don¡¯t listen to me!

144
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,360
Hurts my feelings.

145
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,735
Please just say you¡¯re sorry

146
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,603
so I can let you out this car
so you can maKe my dinner.

147
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,608
I¡¯m sorry, Earl,
for not being able

148
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,699
to repeat your words verbatim,

149
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,211
something I should be able to do.

150
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,110
Whenever I need it.

151
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,477
Whenever you need it.

152
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,745
All right, then.

153
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,420
You looK handsome tonight, Early.

154
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,861

( chucKles)

156

It¡¯s been a long time since
you called me Early.

157
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,868
I liKe it.

00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,532
And you looK pretty tonight.

159
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,575
Maybe a little tired is all.

00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,716
I¡¯m thinKing I want to borrow
some money from you.

162
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,753
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

163
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,881
There¡¯s a big pie BaKe-Off in
Jonesville in a couple months.

164
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,015
And I¡¯d liKe to go.

165
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,753
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

166
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,591
Prize money is pretty good.

167
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,756
- (forK clatters)
- Why do you need money?

168
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,259
I give you everything
you need, don¡¯t I?

169
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,836
Absolutely.

170
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,428
You want for nothing, don¡¯t you?

171
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,770
Yes, Earl, I want for nothing.

172
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,073
I mean, your pies ain¡¯t bad.

173
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,943
But what¡¯s so important about that
when you got me to taKe care of?

174
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,448
That¡¯s a good point, Earl.

185
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,740
Who are you?

186
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,811
I¡¯m your doctor.

187
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,573
Oh, wow, you brought me a pie.

188
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,512
How nice.
You Know what?

189
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,608
I¡¯ve only been here a few weeKs,
but already I am genuinely

190
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,346
impressed with the hospitality of this place.

191
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,445
You¡¯re not my doctor.

192
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,523
Lily Mueller is my doctor.

193
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,750
This pie is for her.

194
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,291
It¡¯s Marshmallow Mermaid,
her favorite.

195
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,690
Well, she¡¯s semiretired now.

196
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,319
Just sort of happened this morning.
She Kind of quit.

197
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,091
We didn¡¯t have time to call anybody.

198
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,132
But Dr. Mueller delivered me.

199
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,632
I mean, she¡¯s been my doctor forever.

200
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,168
I really liKed and trusted her.

201
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,034
Maybe you could really liKe
and trust me, too?

202
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,107
I¡¯ve never even seen you before.

203
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,698
Yeah, I just got hired.

204
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,176
Long story, maKing it short,
this is still

205
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,214
Dr. Mueller¡¯s practice,
I¡¯m the junior doctor on staff.

206
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,215
Um,just moved here from
Connecticut two weeKs ago.

207
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,046
Dr. Mueller had a class
over the summer

208
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,053
and I was a student of hers,
and is this story boring you?

209
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,349
No... yes.

210
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,446
Sorry, anyway,

211
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,957

00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,125
Jenna Hunterson.
It is nice to meet you.

217
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,723
So... What seems to be the problem?

218
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,928
Well, I seem to be pregnant.

219
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,969
Good.

220
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,197
Good for you.
Congratulations.

221
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,671
ThanKs, but I don¡¯t want this baby.

222
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,265
Oh, well, we don¡¯t perform... uh...

223
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,469
No, I¡¯m Keeping it,

224
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,546
I¡¯m just telling you I¡¯m
not so happy about it,

225
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,875
liKe everybody else might be.

226
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,211
So maybe you can be sensitive
and not congratulate me

227
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,217
and maKe a big deal
every time you see me.

228
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,048
I¡¯m having the baby,
and that¡¯s that.

229
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,382
It¡¯s not a party, though.

230
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,185
Got it, oKay, not a party.

231
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,486
Uh, well, then, why don¡¯t we, um...

232
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,255
we¡¯ll have to do a blood test,

233

and then we¡¯ll checK

234
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,329
for diseases, hormone levels,
stuff liKe that?

235
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,524
Sounds liKe a plan.

236
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,602
OKay, well, the nurse
will be right in.

237
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,534
Um... don¡¯t go anywhere.

238
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,939
(door closes)

239
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,509
Nowhere to go.

246
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,824

247
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,451

OKay, any diet concerns?

Is he single?
Maybe he¡¯s good for Dawn.

305
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,639
No, I thinK he was wearing a ring.

306
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,233
Weird guy, nervous.

Hey, honey, could you do me a favor?

Could you taKe him?
I can¡¯t deal with him today.

312

Just nauseous for a second.

320
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,099
(KnocKing at door)

321
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,230
CAL:

323
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,140
(patrons conversing indistinctly)

324
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,976
Hi,Joe.

325
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,576
How you doing today, my friend?

326

What can I get you?

327
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,115
This is my pie diner.

328
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,419
I own it.

329
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,959
I Know you do,Joe.

330
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,154
And I thinK it¡¯s warm in here.
I Know I¡¯m warm.

331
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,494
I¡¯ll tell Cal, hon.

332
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,067
They Keep all my businesses
too warm on the inside.

333
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,104
My gas station, my supermarKet,
my Laundromat...

334
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,504
But this is my favorite business.

335
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,337
Joe¡¯s Pie Shop.

336
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,774
I¡¯m Joe.

337
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,971
And I will not tolerate it being

338
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,513
too damn warm in here.

339
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,741
I hear you,Joe.

340
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,010
Turn the air on.

341
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,745
Yes, sirree, bub.

342
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,218
OKay.

343
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,619
I want two glasses of water, no ice.

344
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,452
Two glasses, no problem.

345
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,786
- Two glasses.
- Right.

346
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,724
No ice.

347
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,423
And I want the ¡°¡°Bad Baby Quiche Pie¡¯¡¯

348
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,829

349
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,026
No potatoes with that?

350
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,660
Did I say anything about potatoes?

351
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,965
Where¡¯d you get potatoes from?

352
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,699
No potatoes, tomato.

353
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,069
On its own plate.

354
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,199
Salt and pepper.

355
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,277
That everything?

356
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,571
No.

357
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,737
I want orange juice.

358
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,904
But don¡¯t bring that first.

359
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:49,981
Bring the water first.

360
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,449
Bring the orange juice
with the meal.

361
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,885
OKay, listen to my horoscope

362
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,685
¡°¡°Aquarius...

363
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,058
Smooth sailing today as Mars
enters your inner circle.¡¯¡¯

364
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,393
Whatever the hell that means.

365
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,628
¡°¡°The ones you love will listen
carefully to you today,

366
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,172
just maKe sure you¡¯re careful
with what you say.¡¯¡¯

367
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,867
Hmm.
I don¡¯t have ones I love.

368
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,068
Want to hear yours?

369
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,201
Uh, I¡¯m Aquarius, too, hon.

370
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,710
I don¡¯t have ones I love either.

371
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,780
Just ones I live with.

372
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,847
Excuse me, I feel liKe

373
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,007
I¡¯m going to be sicK.

374
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,510
(toilet flushes)

375
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,019
(sighs)

376
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,748
(tap running)

377
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,494
You oKay, sweetie?

378
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,860
Yeah, I¡¯m oKay.

379
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,800
Good. Listen, um, I have
a five-minute blind date tonight

380
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,803
with an insurance
salesman named Pete.

381
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,237
Five foot 1 0, 37,
all his hair, nice picture,

382
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,933
- loves fishing.
- Five-minute date?

383
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,840
Can¡¯t the guy pay for
the whole thing?

384
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,971
Yeah, see, um, I have this idea.

385
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,015
I¡¯m meeting men through
personal ads,

386
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,744
but I just give them five minutes.

387
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,251
Whether or not we
liKe each other,

388
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,116
- we just have five minutes together.
- Huh.

389
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,452
That way, you Know,
if the guy maKes me sicK,

390
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,616
I don¡¯t waste a whole evening.
Anyway, I¡¯m supposed

391
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,216
to meet this guy at
7:00 at Banshee¡¯s.

392
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,728
I was wondering if you would
do a full maKeup for me

393
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,320
here in the bathroom,
before I leave?

394
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,059
A full maKeup for five minutes?

395
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,193
Well, yeah, it¡¯s very important
to maKe a good first impression.

396
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,464
I mean, wh-what if he¡¯s
Prince Charming?

397
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,733
There is no such thing.

398
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,933
Whatever.

399
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,442
Will you do that for me?

400
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,602
Yeah, of course.

401
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,270
Oh, would you also maKe me

402
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,245
your ¡°¡°Falling In Love
Chocolate Mousse Pie¡¯¡¯?

403
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,611
That is my favorite pie.

404
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,878
What the hecK, I¡¯ll do
it during my breaK, oKay?

405
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,918
You are the queen

406
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,248
of Kindness and goodness.

407
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,257
(bluesy music playing)

408
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,987
(patrons conversing indistinctly)

409
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,063
You with child?

410
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,064
Shh, quiet.

411
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,999
I¡¯ve seen that looK on
a woman¡¯s face before.

412
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,694
Name was Annette.

413
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,897
I made sweet love to her
all through the summer

414
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,268
of 1 948.

415
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,671
She got that sicK looK

416
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,302
on her face liKe you had
all through the fall.

417
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,243
I almost married her right up.

418
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,746
She lost the baby, though.

419
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,907
Close call.

420
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,109
When you due?

421
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,617
Shh,Joe...

422
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,119
Don¡¯t want Cal to hear.
You can¡¯t lose my job.

423
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,452
I¡¯m trying to save money
so I can leave my husband.

424
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,492
Why, what¡¯s wrong with him?

425
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, there¡¯s no salt and pepper

426
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,626
on the table. I asKed
for salt and pepper

427
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,130
and no ice in my juice glass.

428
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,201
- Can¡¯t you get nothing I say right?
- I¡¯ll go get

429
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,735
your salt and pepper and juice
with no ice.

430
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,963
But you got to promise me

431
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,538
you¡¯ll Keep your mouth shut
about this baby.

432
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,867
What baby?

433
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,704
Good man.

434
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,641
BECKY:
Honey, Earl¡¯s on the phone.

435
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,645
- Tell him I¡¯m busy.
- You don¡¯t talK to him,

436
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,942
he might come over here
and cause a scene again.

437
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,982
Yeah, oKay.

438
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,176
Can I asKyou a question?

439
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,445
Is it my imagination,

440
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,578
or is my left one drooping
down even more today?

441
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,816
I¡¯m starting to feel liKe something Picasso
would have made.

442
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,892
Do me a favor, hon,
get Old Joe some O.J.-

443
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,551

444
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,356
- And some salt and pepper.
- You got it.

445
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,460
Hello, Earl.

446
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,090
Good, good.

447
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,829
No, I-I am glad you called.

448
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,997
You picKing me up tonight?

449
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,042
No, that¡¯s fine, I¡¯ll asK
BecKy to give me a ride.

450
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,108
Yes, I Know you worK hard.

451
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,706

00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:14,950
OKay.

Oh, pretty outfit, Dawn.

00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,065
ThanKyou.

462
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,197
It¡¯s a little tight
in the butt, I fear.

463
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,742
Oh, no worries. Men liKe a little meat
bacK there, don¡¯t they,Jenna?

464
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,174
I have no idea what men liKe.

465
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,609
SpeaKing of more meat,

466
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,739
does Earl have any clue at all
that you¡¯re pregnant?

467
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,283
No, he don¡¯t notice, and
I¡¯m never going to tell him.

468
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,613
I¡¯m just going to run away.

469
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,618
Wow.

470
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,154
How much money you got saved?

471
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,883
Not much, $1 ,200

472
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,390
and I can save
another couple hundred

00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,857
before theJonesville BaKe-Off.

474
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,519
How much is that prize money?

475
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,688
$25,000, hon.

476

Wow. What pie you going to baKe?

477
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,963
I¡¯m not sure.

478
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,468
I was thinKing I¡¯d maKe one
of my real unusual ones,

One where you wouldn¡¯t thinK
the ingredients

481
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,772
would all go together, but they do.

482
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,772
Huh.

483
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,036
Dawn, you¡¯re beautiful.

484
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,237

I Know what you should do

487
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,813
with that prize money,Jenna.

488
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,944
You should open your own pie shop.

489
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,022
Oh, yeah.

490
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,353
You should have your own little
pie shop somewhere.

491
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,620
Somewhere where they could
really use a little pie shop,

492
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,628
liKe Europe or New Jersey.

493
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,494

00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,504
Hey, can you give me
a ride home, BecKy?

498
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,199
Earl don¡¯t want
to picK me up tonight.

499
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,606
No, taKe the bus.

500
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,803
I can¡¯t drive you.
I¡¯ve got somewhere to go.

501
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,038
Oh, where you going?

502
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,774

Why not?

507
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,646
Got to go!

508
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,621
You have fun on
your five-minute date.

509
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,952
Use a five-minute condom.

510
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,026
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Bye.

511
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,116

What are you doing here?

541
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,928
Oh, my car wouldn¡¯t
start this morning-

542
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,058
God Knows why.

543
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,362
Got to taKe the bus home.

544
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,767
Where do you live?

If you liKe trees, which, you Know,

It¡¯s a long walK.

550
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,709
Do you mind if I sit down?

551
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,083
Not at all.

00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,093

I¡¯m a waitress.

Where do you worK?

556
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,497

Oh, wow.

Is it... is it... is it good?

562
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,774
Yes, it¡¯s very good.

563
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,144
We maKe all the pies there fresh.

564
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,686
BreaKfast pies, dinner pies,
27 different varieties of pie.

565
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,017
And a new one that
I create every day.

566
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:47,182
I was just inventing a new one
in my head when you walKed up.

567
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,523
Did you maKe that marshmallow pie
that you brought me?

568
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,189
Yes, I did.
¡°¡°Marshmallow Mermaid Pie.¡¯¡¯

569
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,163
I invented it when I
was nine years old,

570
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,666
in my mermaid phase.

571
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,362
That was probably the best pie
I¡¯ve ever tasted in my life.

572
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,166
That pie, it was...

573
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,333
that pie was biblically good,
that¡¯s how good it was.

574
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,707
That pie could win pie contests

575
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,074
and ribbons and things.
It was...

576
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,238
ThanKyou.

577
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,712
Yeah.

578
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,046
You Know, there was a pie diner
right near where I grew up.

579
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,144
And I used to go there every day
after school.

580
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,850
I had a mad crush on this
waitress named Beatrice.

581
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,948
She looKed tragically cute

582
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,426
in her uniform,

583
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,659
and years later, I was doing my
residency and she came in

584
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,257
with an emergency ovarian cyst.

585
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,995
I actually treated her.

586
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,798
Wow.

587
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,463
That must have been
something for you.

588
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,702
Well, she was at least
50 years old by then.

589
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,043
Life does funny Kind
of things sometimes.

590
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,674
Yes, it does.

591
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,186
Yes, it does.

592
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,848
You want to hear something
else Kind of funny?

593
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,926
When I saw you sitting here
alone in your uniform,

594
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,755
I... I had a flashbacK.

595
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,261
You made me thinK of her.

596
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,923
You Kind of remind me of her

597
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:01,930
when she was younger.

598
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,196
Wow. What a thing to say.

599
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,861
Yeah, sorry, it was a compliment.

600
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,496
No, I Know.

601
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,132
That¡¯s why it made me uncomfortable.

602
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,801
You¡¯re blushing.

603
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,173
Sorry, I shouldn¡¯t have said that.

604
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,543
No, it was a nice thing to hear. I...

605
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,946
Nobody ever notices me in that way.

606
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,950
Well, somebody
noticed you that way-

607
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,952
otherwise you wouldn¡¯t be in
the condition you¡¯re in.

608
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,681
- Oh, him?
- Yeah.

609
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,656
He don¡¯t count.
He¡¯s just my husband.

610

Am I imagining it, or are
your boobies getting bigger?

626
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,045
LiKe they grew a size
practically overnight.

That¡¯s crazy, Earl.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,645
No, no, no.
I don¡¯t want you as my waitress.

646
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,382
I want her, Dawn.

647
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,889
That lady right there.

648
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:14,959
(mouthing)

649
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,357
Oh, well, I¡¯m sorry, honey,

650
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,792
but you¡¯re sitting in my station.

651
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,454
All the tables in Dawn¡¯s
station are taKen.

652
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,122
No, but I don¡¯t want you.
I want her.

653
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,598
Well, if you want to eat
in this diner,

654
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,002
-you got to sit here, and I¡¯ve got to wait on you.
- She a good friend of yours?

655
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,006
What can you tell me about her?
What¡¯s she...

656
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,976
- What are her liKes and disliKes?
What does she looK for in a man?
- Uh, honey,

657
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,673
I¡¯m just here to bring you pie
or coffee or something liKe that.

658
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,248
I don¡¯t dispense romantic advice.

659
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,543
What if I paid you?

660
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,982
Excuse me, I¡¯m going to go

661
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,748

see if she won¡¯t

662
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,517

665
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,467
- You¡¯ve got to help me.
- What is going on?

666
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,901
That guy, his name is Ogie,

667
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,335
short for OKlahoma.

668
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,407
I was supposed to meet someone
named Pete last night.

669
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,600
Instead, he sent Ogie.

670
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,609
It was the worst five minutes in my life.

671
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,804
I made the mistaKe of
telling him I worK here.

672
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,347
J ENNA:
How could a five-minute date be that bad?

673
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,746
He tooK me through the entire medical

674
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,045
and psychiatric history of his family.

675
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,141
Oh, no.

676
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,948
And he told me he wants to marry me.

677
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,750
- Oh, no!
- Marry me!

678
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,417
And he¡¯s not giving up, not ever giving up,
that¡¯s what he said.

679
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,494
First guy that pays any
attention to me in years,

680
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,563
and he turns out to be
the mad stalKing elf.

681
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,563
I¡¯m telling you,Jenna,
your maKeup job was too good,

682
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,632
and your ¡°¡°Magic Love Pie...¡¯¡¯?

683
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,791
I¡¯m sorry.

684
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,199
- What am I supposed to do?
- You go over there

685
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,770
and you tell him you¡¯re not interested.

686
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,601
- I told him that last night.
- Tell him better.

687
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,732
- Come with me.
- I can¡¯t. I¡¯ve got to go throw up.

688
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,445
Fine, I¡¯ll just
go over there myself.

689
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,181
I¡¯m a very persistent man, Dawn.

690
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,480
I Know what I want.
I Know what maKes me happy.

691
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,554
Blah, blah, blah.

692
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,816
I¡¯m a tax auditor.

693
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,155
I maKe $31 ,000 a year plus bonuses.

694
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,161
I drive a very nice compact car.

695
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,697
I eat at all the best restaurants

696
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,391
within a 50-mile radius.

697
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,489
I love my mother.

698
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,228
What else do you need
to Know about me?

699
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,702
- How to maKe you go away.
- You can¡¯t.

700
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,467
You can¡¯t maKe me go away.

701
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,132
¡¯Cause I don¡¯t taKe
no for an answer.

702
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,836
I¡¯ll just Keep coming bacK

till finally your resistance is weaKened.

704
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,575
¡¯Cause we were meant
to be together, Dawn.

705
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,774
You don¡¯t Know me!

706
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:19,907
Oh, yes, I do.

707
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,111
You¡¯re Dawn.

708
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,485
And you inspire poetry in me.

709

- Do you liKe that one?
- No!

714
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,868
OKay, how about a spontaneous
tidbit that rhymes?

715

¡°¡°All my life I¡¯ve met harlots,

Yeah.

And has it stopped?

785

Yeah, I only saw it the one time.

786
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,706
OKay, good.

No, no need. No.

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,440
Mm.

799
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,845
Well, am I oKay? I mean,
is something wrong with me?

800
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,974
No.

801
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,279
Mm!

802
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,321
No, there¡¯s nothing wrong with you.

803
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,515
Uh, light spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom

804
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,522
in early pregnancy.

805
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,853
Were you concerned
about a miscarriage?

806
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,326
Not really.

807
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,194
Is that everything you have to say?

808
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,860
Um...

809
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,958
yes.

810
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,998
- No.
- Well, what?

811
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,676
I...

812
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,842
Nothing.

813
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,679
Um, you can go now.
Uh... I¡¯ll see you

814
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,049
at your next regularly scheduled
appointment, and again, don¡¯t

815
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,645
- hesitate to call...
- To call you if I have any questions or concerns.

816
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,986
Exactly.

817
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,925
Why¡¯d you have me come
all the way in here

818
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,053
if spotting¡¯s a perfectly normal symptom

819
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,426
in early pregnancy?

820
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,695
I mean, I had to get up early,
taKe a bus, walK five blocKs,

821
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,032
just to hear that spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom?

822
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,471
I have no response to that.

823
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,635
And what time does this office
normally open, Doctor, 8:30?

824
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,474
9:00.

825
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,911
9:00?

826
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,178
So-So you came in here two hours
early just to tell me

827
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,082
that spotting is a perfectly
normal symptom?

828
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,452
Well, it would seem that way, yes.

829
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,659
Good-bye, Dr. Pomatter.

830
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,022
Good-bye,Jenna.

831
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,595
I thinKyou¡¯re strange.

832
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,096
I¡¯m not sure I want you
to be my doctor anymore.

833
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,496
You maKe me uncomfortable.

834
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,067
I¡¯m sorry,Jenna.
I¡¯m really sorry.

835
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,364
Whatever it is I do,
I will not do it anymore.

836
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,268
You should not be uncomfortable
at this time.

837
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,273
- You¡¯re doing it again.
- How? What did I...?

838
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,775
I don¡¯t Know, you Know,
that nice-guy-talKy thing you do.

839
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,811
You just... Oh, forget it.

840
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,843
Damn! My purse!

841
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,784
You forgot your pur...

842
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,084
(gasps)

843
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,596
Hey!

844
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,461
Don¡¯t walK away from me.

845
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,602
Well, what do you want?

846
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,228
I want to see you again.

847
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,500
I want to talK to you
somewhere outside of here.

848
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,371
Maybe we could have
a coffee or something.

849
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,206
I can¡¯t have coffee.
It¡¯s on the bad food list you gave me.

850
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,838
- What Kind of doctor are you?
- Well, you don¡¯t have to have coffee.

851
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,246
You could have water or fruit juice.

852
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,578
That¡¯s a bad idea.

853
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,414
I¡¯m married. You¡¯re married.

854
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,418
I¡¯m pregnant.

855
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,453
- You¡¯re my doctor.
- Uh...

856
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,954
You¡¯re right, it¡¯s crazy.
It¡¯s unethical

857
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,183
on my part. I...

858
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,884
( choir chanting
over classical orchestration)

859
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,437
Wait!

860
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,838
No Kissing in the street.

861
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,466
I have a very jealous husband.

862
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,635
He¡¯d Kill you

863
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,610
if he ever saw us.
He don¡¯t liKe when other men

864
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,908
- even looK at me.
- Is he large?

865
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,175
He¡¯s large enough,
and he drives

866
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,444
- right past here on the way to worK.
- Well, maybe we

867
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,985
shouldn¡¯t be standing
in the street then.

868
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,653
I¡¯ve got to go maKe pies.

869
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,656
It¡¯ll taKe me time to walK
the five blocKs,

870
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,726
wait for the bus.
I don¡¯t want to be late.

871
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,795
- Cal gets mad when I¡¯m late.
- Let me drive you.

872
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,294
No. Yes.

873
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,592
Please.

874
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,370
Well, thanKyou for the tarts.

875
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,534
They were unbelievably delicious.

876
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,009
¡°¡°Delicious¡¯¡¯ is not even

877
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,273
a good enough word
for what they are. They...

878
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,112
I mean, what you do with food is...

879
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,516
unearthly.
It¡¯s sensual.

880
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,780
Does anybody else appreciate...?

881
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:11,820
You¡¯re welcome.

882
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,890
So, um...

883
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,852
Do we...? I mean, what do we...?

884
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,725
- Dr. Pomatter, I¡¯ll call you
- Can I...

885
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,025
if I have any questions or concerns.

886
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,877
( engine starts)

887
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,657
(dreamy lullaby plays)

888
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,760
¡°Earl Murders Me
¡¯Cause I¡¯m Having an Affair Pie. ¡¯¡±

889
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,702
You smash blackberries and raspberries

890
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,365
into a chocolate crust.

891
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,137
¡°I Can¡¯t Have No Affair
Because It¡¯s Wrong

892
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,474
And I Don¡¯t Want Earl
To Kill Me Pie. ¡¯¡±

893
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,107
Vanilla custard with banana.

894
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,184
Hold the banana.

895
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,912
Don¡¯t you have no home?

896
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,079
Excuse me. What?

897
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,623
I¡¯m wondering if you have
to sleep outside my diner,

898
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,352
¡¯cause maybe you don¡¯t have no home.

899
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,392
I have a home.

900
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,426
Right,

901
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,723
and a bad husband, I remember.

902
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,458
You got lipsticK all over your face.

903
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,498
What?

904
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,624
Your lipsticK
is all smudged,

905
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,930
liKe someone gave you a good one.

906
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,437
I¡¯m going inside now.

907
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,440
Once you¡¯re done wiping away
all your indiscretions,

908
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,941
I¡¯ll be sitting in my booth

909
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,343
wanting fresh-squeezed
orange juice, no ice,

910
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,278
and a ¡°¡°Spanish Dancer Pie¡¯¡¯

911
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,510
with potato crust.

912
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,082
(sighs)

913
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,089
Here you go.

914
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,690
¡°¡°Dear Elizabeth...¡¯¡¯
Do you Know this column?

915
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,963
It¡¯s for the lonely hearts.

916
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,629
¡°¡°Dear Elizabeth.

917
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,173
¡°¡°My husband fell in love
with another woman

(laughing)

921
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,804
¡°¡°I want to write

¡°¡°the perfect suicide note

923
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,046
¡°¡°that would let him Know just
how much pain he has caused me.

924
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,142
(laughing)

925
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,991
¡°¡°I¡¯m wondering if you can
dispense any advice

926
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,026
¡°¡°on composing
a suicide note

927
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,618
¡°¡°that would harm
my snaKe of a husband

928
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,722
¡°¡°and his slut girlfriend the most.

929
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,825
Yours truly- Betrayed in Biloxi.¡¯¡¯

930

( chucKling)

931
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,706
Elizabeth just gives her
some nonsense

932
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,368
about not Killing herself.

933
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,377
I love living vicariously

934
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,879
through the pain and suffering
of others.

935
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,973
I don¡¯t believe for one second
you¡¯re as mean as you play.

936
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,779
You tip me better than anyone.

937
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,376
Oh, what do you Know?

938
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,355
Bring me more water
for this empty glass.

939
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,618
Mm-hmm.

940
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,220

WOMAN:
No. No.

Mommy!

944
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,230
What did I say?

945
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,357
No.

946
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,197
All right, now stop it, sugar, please?

947
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,396
- OKay, you can have chocolate milK, oKay?
- (screams)

948
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,871
I¡¯m sorry. You can have
as much chocolate milK as you want.

949
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,963
(laughs)

950
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,043
OKay, all right, you little...

951
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,338
OKay.

952
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,503
Jenna, come on.

953
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,547
Listen, you can have
chocolate milK, oKay?

954
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,084
Here, darling,
we bought you something,

955
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,345
a present.

956
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,784
That¡¯s sweet.
You shouldn¡¯t have.

957
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,355
Open it.

958
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,684
OKay.

959
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,026
Oh, it¡¯s a booK.

960
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:41,256
What a Mama You¡¯re Going to Be.

961
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,662
Oh, looK at that.

962
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,291
We Know you didn¡¯t initially
have a strong happiness

963
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,494
about this whole baby thing,

964
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,832
but she is coming anyway.

965
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,166
We don¡¯t Know it¡¯s a she.

966
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,264
We figured we¡¯d give you something

967
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,842
that every woman
is supposed to read.

968
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,968
And every woman is supposed
to read something liKe that...

969
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,137
we thinK.

970
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,271
Well, thanKs.

971
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,941
- You best read and absorb it.
- Hey, you Know,

972
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,746
I was thinKing. Have you ever
heard about those people

973
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,650
who sell their babies
for lots of money

974
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,017
through, liKe, lawyers and stuff?

975
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,284
Jenna, you can¡¯t sell your baby.
That¡¯s a horrible thought.

976
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,290
I was just thinKing,

977
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,792
if I did, I might
maKe enough money

978
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,226
to finally get away from Earl.

979
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,854
I mean, at this point, the baby
is the only real financial asset

980
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,762
I have if I don¡¯t win
that pie contest.

981
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,132
I am going to pretend
that you are not saying this.

982
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,864
Not everybody wants
to be a mama, Dawn.

983
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,099
That don¡¯t maKe me a bad person.

984
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,573
You¡¯re not getting
any more affectionate

985
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,574
towards that little baby?

986
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:27,609
Not at all?

987
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,679
I respect this baby¡¯s right to thrive.

988
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,974
I do nothing harmful to it.

989
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,413
I don¡¯t drinK,
I watch my diet, but no.

990
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,747
I feel nothing liKe affection.

991
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,720
Maybe that man smothered
all the affection out of me.

992
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,380
I don¡¯t Know.

993
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,419
Well, I got to get bacK to worK.

994
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,689
Yeah, uh, breaKfast crowd¡¯s
heating up.

995
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,025
Yeah.

996
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,292
Hey, thanKs for the booK.

997
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,231
All right.

998
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:55,271
Jenna, there¡¯s all these
cool things to do in here.

999
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,466
Um, there¡¯s a little scrapbooK
section in the bacK,

1000
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,739
where you can put pictures
of your pregnant belly as it develops.

1001
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,871
Oh, and there¡¯s a place where
you can write your first letter to your baby.

1002
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,074
- Oh.
- Right here.

1003
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,515
Right in the middle.

1004
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,110
OKay, Dawn, thanKs.

1005
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,992
First Letter To My Baby.

1006
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,723
First letter.

1007
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,992
OLDJOE:
Where¡¯s my water?

1008
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,627
Dear baby...

1009
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,472
Dear baby,

1010
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,237
if I was writing you a letter,

1011
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,180
it would probably sound
something like an apology.

1012
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,978
I know everyone deserves a mama

1013
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,986
who¡¯d want a nice baby
such as yourself-

1014
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:48,422
who was also a good wife,
a fine member of society.

1015
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,790
And I can¡¯t rightly say
that I¡¯m any of that,

1016
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,921
and I¡¯m not sure the world
is such a fine place

1017
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,590
to be bringing you.

1018
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,136
Many of the people I¡¯ve met
are not worth meeting.

1019
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:04,435
Many of the things that happen
are not worth living through.

1020
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,204
And you shouldn¡¯t take it
personal, baby,

1021
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,180
if I don¡¯t seem like all the
other mamas-to-be,

1022
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,682
jumping all over themselves
with joy.

1023
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,516
I frankly don¡¯t know
what I got to give you, baby.

1024
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:22,080
What if I leave Earl and don¡¯t
win that contest next week

1025
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,181
and don¡¯t have no money?

1026
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,557
What the hell am I going to do
with you then?

1027
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,756
(Earl groans)

1028
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,034
You sure is getting fat, baby.

1029
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,569
( chucKles)

1030
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,571
All my life, baby,

1031
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,973
the only thing I ever want
to do is run away.

1032
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,375
What kind of mama is that?

1033
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,877
I wish I could feel other things, baby.

1034
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,749
Like excitement
that you¡¯re with me now

1035
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,618
or faith that I¡¯ll be a good mama,

1036
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,487
even if my life
ain¡¯t such a good place

1037
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,583
and the world as I see it
ain¡¯t so pretty

1038
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,721
like they¡¯d have you believe
in this book.

1039
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,733
Anyway, I¡¯m writing
this letter to you.

1040
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,565
It sounds more like a letter
to me, don¡¯t it?

1041
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,508
Love, Mama.

1042
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:19,144
(horn honKing)

1043
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,823
Where you going,Jenna?

1044
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,865
Nowhere, Earl.

1045
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,768
I-I mean, to worK.

1046
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,273
Then why you got a suitcase?

1047
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:49,610
(groans)

1048
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,305
Earl!

1049
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,940
- Shut up and get in the car.
- (sobbing)

1050
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,024
(sniffling)

1051
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,058
Pie-baKing contest, huh?

1052
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,832
Yeah, I was just going to go up there
and win and surprise you.

1053
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,973
No, you¡¯re lying.

1054
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,847
You ain¡¯t never gone to
a contest before in your life.

1055
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,182
You¡¯re lying to me.

1056
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,479
Earl, don¡¯t...

1057
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,220
Why you lying to me?

1058
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,289
I¡¯m pregnant!

1059
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,324
(tires squealing)

1060
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,539
When was you going to tell me?

1061
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,582
After I won the pie contest.

1062
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:03,312
Well, you ain¡¯t going
to no pie contest.

1063
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,821
You Know what?
You ain¡¯t going nowhere.

1064
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:12,224
Here¡¯s the thing, wife-

1065
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,390
What if you decide to love
the baby more than you love me?

1066
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,525
Women do it all the time.

1067
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,071
They have a baby and then
it¡¯s to hell with the man.

1068
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,072
You¡¯re jealous of the baby?

1069
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,869
No, I don¡¯t get jealous.

1070
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,638
It¡¯s below me.

1071
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:29,905
I¡¯m just talKing it out.

1072
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,207
I¡¯m talKing my feelings out.

1073
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,783
And I Know how women get.

1074
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,976
And I¡¯m just not sure I want
that happening.

1075
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,189
I¡¯d tell you to
get rid of it,

1076
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,690
but I want you
in the same place

1077
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,387
as me in the hereafter,
if you Know what I mean.

1078
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,991
Maybe if you promise me

1079
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,898
that you wouldn¡¯t love the baby
more than you love me.

1080
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,163
You Know?

1081
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,296
That you¡¯d maKe
a real effort to love me more.

1082
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,431
If I need something,

1083
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,669
you¡¯d Keep taKing care of it.

1084
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,210
You¡¯d hold on to me more.

1085
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,678
I come first- not any baby.

1086
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,114
Well, can you maKe
Early that promise?

1087
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,380
Absolutely.

1088
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,386
Then say ¡°¡°I promise.¡¯¡¯

1089
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,081
I promise.

1090
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,160
Say ¡°¡°I promise I will not love the baby

1091
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,455
more than I love you, Early.¡¯¡¯

1092
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,962
I promise I will not love the baby

1093
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,658
more than I love you, Early.

1094
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,560
How about that?

1095
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:32,108
We¡¯re going to have
ourselves a baby.

1096
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,177
A baby boy.

1097
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,840
I bet it happened that night
I got you all drunK.

1098
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,281
( chucKles)

1099
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,647
Where you going?

1100
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,913
Gotta throw up.

1101
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,455
(woman singing Italian aria)

1102
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:55,429
WOMAN:
Mrs. Hunterson, the doctor will see you now.

1103
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,631
(door closes)

1104
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,226
Hi there.
I¡¯m Nurse Norma.

1105
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,431
I¡¯ll be helping Dr. Pomatter

1106
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,407
with your ultrasound
examination today.

1107
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,034
You have any questions?

1108
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,375
This is where we looK at
the baby¡¯s heartbeat?

1109
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,778
Yes, among other things.

1110
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,908
You nervous?

1111
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,849
No. Do I seem nervous?

1112
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,785
Yes, you do.

1113
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,015
That¡¯s normal.

1114
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,614
Everybody¡¯s nervous before
their first ultrasound.

1115
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,591
I¡¯m not nervous, though.

1116
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,026
OKay, you¡¯re not nervous.

1117
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,027
(KnocK at door)

1118
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,758
Come in. I¡¯m dressed.

1119
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,094
Hello, Doctor.

1120
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:32,293
Hello, Mrs. Hunterson.

1121
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,528
How have you been feeling?

1122
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,604
Fine.

1123
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,672
No problems?

1124
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,898
Nope.

1125
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,168
You had no questions or concerns
this past month.

1126
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,177
No, I certainly did not.

1127
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,044
OKay, well, lie bacK.

1128
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,049
Uh, Norma, would you get
the lights for me?

1129
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,722
All right,
this isn¡¯t going to hurt at all.

1130
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,724
It¡¯s just going to be a little cold.

1131
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,259
(rubber gloves snapping)

1132
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,023
Here we go.

1133
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,461
All right.

1134
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,934
OKay,just a little pressure.

1135
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,299
Now what are we looKing at?

1136
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,547
Ah, there we are.

1137
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,207
We are definitely having a baby.

1138
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,080
You want to see?

1139
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,516
I guess.

1140
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,178
Just looK at the screen.

1141
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:26,346
There.

1142
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,923
Everything looKs great.

1143
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,083
You see that little...
that flicKering

1144
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,184
right there in the middle of the screen?

1145
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,660
Yeah.

1146
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,958
Right there.

1147
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,090
That¡¯s the heartbeat.

1148
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,600
- Congratulations, Mrs. Hunterson.
- Glory be. Hallelujah.

1149
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,762
Uh, Mrs. Hunterson doesn¡¯t really liKe
to be congratulated.

1150
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,635
Oh, sorry.

1151
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,731
Huh.

1152
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,777
Don¡¯t really looK liKe
much at this point.

1153
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,609
Certainly don¡¯t looK
liKe no baby yet.

1154
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,615
Well...

1155
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,981
Ah, thanKyou, Norma.
That¡¯s all we need you for.

1156
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,576
All done here.

1157
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,283
(door opens)

1158
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,449
Well, there you have it.

1159
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,925
Yeah.

1160
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,155
So I guess we are officially
forgetting about that nonsense

1161
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,856
that happened last month?

1162
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,432
Yes, we officially are.

1163
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,796
I want to apologize for it.

1164
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,460
I almost called you
just to apologize.

1165
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,868
I mean, I was so
stressed out at the time,

1166
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,234
taKing on all those new patients.

1167
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,364
I hadn¡¯t been sleeping well.

1168
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,909
My judgment was not
what it normally is.

1169
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,343
I want you to Know
that¡¯ll never happen again.

1170
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,675
From now on our relationship

1171
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,272
will be strictly a medical
and professional one.

1172
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,643
( clattering)

1173
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,686
Jenna, no.

1174
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,126
Not with the door open.

1175
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,934
( choir chanting
over classical orchestration)

1176
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,525
J ENNA:
Dear baby.

1177
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:50,595
P.S. I¡¯d want to be able to
teach a baby such as yourself

1178
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,471
the difference between good and bad,
right and wrong...

1179
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,169
(KnocKing at door)

1180
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,838
...but it seems I¡¯m not fit
to teach nobody nothing.

1181
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,041
NORMA:
Dr. Pomatter, you still in there?

1182
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,640
You got a phone call.

1183
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,514
I¡¯ll be right out, Norma.

1184
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,781
Mrs. Hunterson needs to be weighed.
Would you taKe care of that?

1185
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,949
And you can get dressed.
I¡¯ll see you in my office in a few minutes.

1186
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,739
Don¡¯t do that again.

1187
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,904
OKay, what? OKay, I won¡¯t.

1188
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,072
Kiss you, you mean?

1189
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,377
No, not that.
I didn¡¯t mean that.

1190
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,647
I mean don¡¯t go away for
a full month and not call.

1191
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,686
No questions or concerns.

1192
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,880
Don¡¯t do that.

1193
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,150
This is craziness, Dr. Pomatter.

1194
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,725
Please, call meJim.

1195
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,918
No, I won¡¯t.

1196
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,722
OKay, don¡¯t.
Just Dr. Pomatter¡¯s fine.

1197
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,387
Dr. Pomatter, this is so...

1198
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,522
I don¡¯t want to have another conversation

1199
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,895
about how crazy this is

1200
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,401
or how sorry I am,
or how bad

1201
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,835
my judgment is, or how I¡¯ll
never touch you again.

1202
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,170
Not only would I be lying,
but every time I start saying

1203
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,176
those things, all that happens
is you attacK me.

1204
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,212
- You¡¯re right.
- Have you been taKing your

1205
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,610
- prenatal vitamins every day?
- Faithfully.

1206
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,181
Any bad morning sicKness?

1207
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,750
- Not too bad, no.
- No more spotting?

1208
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,580
- No more spotting.
- Good, I¡¯m going to want to see

1209
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,176
you again on Friday
for another appointment.

1210
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,085
Do you have time in the afternoon?

1211
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,282
Do you get a lunch breaK?

1212
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,018
Yeah, but I¡¯ll have to asK BecKy
to drive me.

1213
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,594
AsK BecKy to drive you.
Noon.

1214
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,391
Tell the nurse at the desK on your way out
that you want to be fit in.

1215
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,990
I have to go to St. Mary¡¯s now
and deliver a baby.

1216
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,695
Because that¡¯s what I do.

1217
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:28,896
OKay.

1218
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,132
Are we on the same page now?

1219
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,436
We¡¯re on the same page.

1220
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,135
Good, then.

1221
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,177
(banging desK)

1222
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,953
I wish it were Friday.

J ENNA:

1230
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,039
At first, it was really
just about the sex...

Jenna, the doctor is
ready for you now.

1234
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,350
WOMAN:
Hi there.

1235
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,546
Oh, Dr. Mueller,

1236
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,123
how are you?

1237
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,248
I thought you retired.

1238
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,621
Semiretired.

1239
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,922
I¡¯m just out of retirement
for the day, my dear.

1240
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,122
Dr. Pomatter and his wife
had to fly bacK east

1241
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,131
for a funeral this morning.

1242
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,066
Oh, he flew bacK east with his wife?

1243
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,296
How you feeling?
You doing oKay these days?

1244
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:18,431
I¡¯m fine.Just fine. You Know,
KnocKed up and everything.

1245
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,406
Yes, I heard.

1246
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,239
How¡¯s it worKing out
with Dr. Pomatter?

1247
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,336
Oh, he¡¯s a great doctor.

1248
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,043
Is he coming bacK soon?

1249
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,447
I don¡¯t really Know.

1250
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,075
I thinK so.

1251
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,778
Today we¡¯re going to do
some blood worK.

1252
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,583
It¡¯s standard stuff.

1253
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,214
Just to see how the baby¡¯s developing.

1254
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,259
I don¡¯t care.
Do I have to do it?

1255
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,884
Yeah, you have to do it.

1256
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,122
You may be a little
weaK afterwards,

1257
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,630
so you should
call your husband

1258
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,563
or somebody to come picKyou up.

1259
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,066
Yeah, I¡¯ll call him.

1260
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,103
Is that pumpKin pie for me?

1261
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,138
Kind of.

1262
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,105
It¡¯s just something I invented.

J ENNA:
Hey,

1266
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,893
you ever going to tell us
your secret, girl?

1267
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,522
Yes, I am, when I¡¯m ready.

DAWN:
I¡¯ve got a secret, too.

BECKY:
You, Dawn?

1270
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,269
Yes. I have a boyfriend now.

00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,840
Yes.

1273
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,169
Well, who is he?

1274
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,436
Tell us everything, honey.

1275
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,512
You¡¯re never going to believe
it, but, um... you Know

1276
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,603
that guy came to the diner
that day, wouldn¡¯t leave?

1277
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:32,612
Name was Ogie?

1278
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:33,977
Ogie, the stalKing elf?

1279
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,141
Yeah, I remember that guy.

1280
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,240
What about him?

1281
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,883
Well, it-it¡¯s him.

1282
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,957
(gasps)

1283
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,027
Well, that is wonderful, Dawn!

1284
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,155
Isn¡¯t it,Jenna?

1285
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,630
Yeah, that¡¯s wonderful.

1286
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,633
How¡¯d that happen?

1287
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,067
Well, you Know,
he was true to his word.

1288
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,002
He didn¡¯t never give up.

1289
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,471
His cousin Pete gave him my number.

1290
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,736
He called me, liKe,
30 times in one day.

1291
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,209
I thought I might Kill him.

1292
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,041
But he got to me.

1293
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,341
He did?

1294
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,472
Yeah.

1295
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,107
Well, he¡¯s so passionate.

1296
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,810
He writes me
these spontaneous poems.

1297
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,513
Spontaneous poems.

1298
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,557
Yes, they are poems that just
occur to him right on the spot.

1299
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,592
Last night he said to me,

1300
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:21,755
¡°¡°Dawn, your face is a brilliant
moon in my empty room.¡¯¡¯

1301
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:22,923
Aw...

1302
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,897
¡°¡°Your love is
liKe a beating drum,

1303
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,559
ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-bum.¡¯¡¯

1304
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,829
Hmm.

1305
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,405
And yeah, I Know what you¡¯re
thinKing, that he¡¯s not...

1306
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,908
so pretty... but

1307
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,069
he grows on you.

1308
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,444
And anyway, he¡¯s it,
¡¯cause nobody else wants me.

1309
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,150
Well, honey, you probably
shouldn¡¯t be with someone

1310
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,743
just ¡¯cause nobody else wants you.

1311
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,845
Yeah, well, you are.

1312
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,287
And you wouldn¡¯t Know it

1313
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,622
to looK at him,
but he is a sexual dynamo.

1314
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:52,752
Wow.

1315
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,625
No, you wouldn¡¯t Know it.

1316
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,255
J ENNA:
Well, Dawn,

1317
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,061
I sure hope it¡¯s maKing you happy.

1318
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,567
You don¡¯t mean that.

1319
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,864
Yes, I do.

1320
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,199
Nope.

1321
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,467
I Know what you¡¯re thinKing,
¡¯cause you called him an elf.

1322
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:08,806
Only ¡¯cause you initially
called him an elf.

1323
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,140
- You¡¯re jealous.
- No!

1324
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,372
You are.

1325
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,006
Because you have the most mean,
controlling husband

1326
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,085
in the world,
and you are stucK there!

1327
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,983
But I have found someone
who loves me to death!

1328
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,248
Well, let¡¯s hope not to death.

1329
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,414
And I am happy!

1330
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,492
Good.

1331
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,420
When the fruit pies go in,
would you put this one in with that one?

1332
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,261
I¡¯m going to go and clean up now
and set up my station.

1333
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,634
We¡¯ll see you out there!

1334
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,535
Don¡¯t say nothing.

1335
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,735
I wasn¡¯t gonna.

1336
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,607
I¡¯m not in no position
to judge nobody.

1337
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,078
Neither are you.

1338
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,081
I hope I didn¡¯t hurt her
feelings too bad.

1339
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,343
She¡¯ll be fine.

1340
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:51,113
- Hey, is Cal inside yet?
- Yeah, I saw him.

1341
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,848
ThinK it¡¯s time for me
to tell him about the baby.

1342
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,424
You got the oven under control?

1343
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,787
- I do.
- Wish me lucK.

1344
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,361
Wishing you lucK, honey.

1345
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,359
Well, uh...

1346
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,657
What?

1347
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,564
It seems I¡¯m almost
five months pregnant.

1348
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,535
Yeah, so?

1349
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,333
So I just thought I should tell you.

1350
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,429
I already Knew.

1351
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,838
You did?

1352
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,534
Yeah, I thought everybody Knew.

1353
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,441
Oh, who told you?

1354
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,639
Nobody told me.
Nobody needs to tell me.

1355
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:19,840
I mean, looK at you.

1356
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,041
What¡¯d you thinK?

1357
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,015
I thought you went and got fat?

1358
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,280
Truth be told,
as long as you can carry a tray

1359
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,514
and fill a pie tin,

1360
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,150
I don¡¯t care
if you give birth while doing it.

1361
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,454
Well, I¡¯m relieved.

1362
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:35,588
I¡¯m not such a bad guy, maybe.

1363
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,064
You¡¯re not such a bad guy, maybe.

1364
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,930
Well, get out there
and get to worK,Jenna.

1365
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,594
Come on. We ain¡¯t got all day.

1366
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:42,728
I¡¯ll get to worK.

1367
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:47,105
(bluesy music plays)

1368
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,374
** (man singing)

1369
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,971
How you doing today,Joe?

1370
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,915
Same bastard as yesterday,Jenna.

1371
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,010
How are you?

1372
01:00:58,121 --> 01:00:59,520
Same train wrecK.

1373
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,021
And how¡¯s the baby doing so far?

1374
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,719
So far so good, no problems,
no birth defects,

1375
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,158
no diseases, whatever.

1376
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,627
Good, good.

1377
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,197
How¡¯s the bad husband?

1378
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,822
Just awful.

1379
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:11,922
And the lipsticK smudger?

1380
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,263
The lipsticK smudger?

1381
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,631
The dog on the side.

1382
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,863
The affair.

1383
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,940
(whispers):
Shh,Joe, I¡¯m not having no affair.

1384
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,101
OKay, you¡¯re not having no affair.

1385
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,701
Want to hear your horoscope
before I give you my order?

1386
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:24,711
No.

1387
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,805
Too bad, here it is.

1388
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,043
¡°¡°Aquarius.

1389
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,246
¡°¡°If, indeed, you¡¯re having an affair,

1390
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,414
¡°¡°it might be a good time to step bacK,

1391
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,116
¡°¡°looK at your life

1392
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,590
and reassess things a bit.¡¯¡¯

1393
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,127
It don¡¯t say that in there.

1394
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,388
Yes, it does.

1395
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:44,432
It says, ¡°¡°Even if you have
a miserable, snaKe husband,

1396
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,968
¡°¡°you probably shouldn¡¯t be
having no affair,

1397
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,628
¡°¡°¡¯cause it¡¯s beneath you

1398
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,571
¡°¡°and could maKe you seem
liKe a common hussy.

1399
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,574
¡°¡°Not to mention the pain

1400
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,507
you could cause other people.¡¯¡¯

1401
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,010
You¡¯re just maKing that up.

1402
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:01,644
This afternoon I want the
¡°¡°Singing Tuna Fish Casserole¡¯¡¯

1403
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,309
no picKle on the plate.

1404
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,681
Well-done Frenchie fries

1405
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:09,451
with melted Swiss cheese
and gravy on their own plate,

1406
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,083
and ¡°¡°Jenna¡¯s Special Strawberry

1407
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,059
Chocolate Oasis Pie.¡¯¡¯
You got that?

1408
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:14,424
I got that.

1409
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,498
Give me a smile,Jenna.

1410
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,159
Nobody maKes strawberry
chocolate pie the way you do.

1411
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,361
Wednesday¡¯s my favorite day
of the weeK,

1412
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,302
¡¯cause I get to have a slice of it.

1413
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,601
I thinK about it as I¡¯m waKing up.

1414
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,199
Could solve all the problems
with the world, that pie.

1415
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,573
You¡¯re maKing too much of it.

1416
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,169
It¡¯s just a pie.

1417
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,077
Just a pie?

1418
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,080
It¡¯s downright expert.

1419
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,775
A thing of beauty.

1420
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,321
How each flavor opens itself,
one by one,

1421
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,754
liKe a chapter in a booK.

1422
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,952
First the flavor
of an exotic spice hits you,

1423
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,995
just a hint of it.

1424
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:51,499
And then you¡¯re flooded with
chocolate, darK and bittersweet,

1425
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,933
liKe an old love affair.

1426
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,937
And finally, strawberry;

1427
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,372
the way strawberry was always
supposed to taste,

1428
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,465
but never Knew how.

1429
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,704
In fact,

1430
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,337
I tell you what.

1431
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,643
Forget all the other stuff
I ordered.

1432
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,274
Just bring me the damn pie.

1433
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,750
That¡¯s all I want.

1434
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,150
I don¡¯t care if it¡¯s not

1435
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,153
a well-balanced meal.

1436
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,281
Just bring me the pie.

1437
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,225
Old Joe¡¯ll maybe not have much
longer to live, you Know?

1438
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,523
Then I better bring you the pie
right away.

1439
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,327
Yes¡¯m, you better.

1440
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,428
- CAL: I love you!
- Oh!

1441
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,565
I love your breast.
I love your breast.

1442
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,734
I love this breast! Mmm!
I liKe this breast, too!

1443
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,869
- Oh!
- (shrieKs)

1444
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,947
Uh, there¡¯s my order, Cal,

1445
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,948
and I¡¯m going
to need a slice of Oasis.

1446
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,416
Gonna go throw up now.

1447
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,713
Jenna.

1448
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,413
- Whoa!
- No, Cal!

1449
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,989
-Jenna!
- Hey!

1450
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,580
(sighs)

1451
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,557
I didn¡¯t plan it,Jenna.

1452
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,823
It just happened.

1453
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,956
He¡¯s got such nice, strong hands.

1454
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,727
Your poor husband.

1455
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,427
My poor husband
wears a diaper,

1456
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,061
curses constantly
and sleeps in a separate room.

1457
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,730
So why don¡¯t you
just divorce him then?

1458
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,309
I can¡¯t just leave
a sicK, crazy, old man.

1459
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,809
What Kind of person would do that?

1460
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,311
I don¡¯t Know. What Kind of person
has an affair with Cal,

1461
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,473
who¡¯s married to Ethel,
who we see all the time?

1462
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,481
He says she¡¯s awful.

1463
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,846
Maybe anyone
you stay married to

1464
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,647
for 1 5 years starts to seem awful.

1465
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,584
But we Know Ethel.
She¡¯s not awful.

1466
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,623
She tells Cal not to yell at us.

1467
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:25,125
Hey, you¡¯re supposed
to be my friend, not Ethel¡¯s.

1468
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,492
Having an affair
is a terrible thing to do.

1469
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,794
It destroys people¡¯s lives, and I don¡¯t
want you messed up with all that.

1470
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,867
(KnocKing at door)

1471
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,595
DAWN:
Jenna, there¡¯s this cute guy here

1472
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,601
to see you.

1473
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,104
He says he¡¯s your doctor.

1474
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,572
That¡¯s perfect.
Just perfect.

1475
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,209
What are you doing here?

1476
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,249
- You can¡¯t just come here.
- I had an hour to Kill.

1477
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,943
I wanted to see you.

1478
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,247
Did you maKe this pie?
It¡¯s bliss. Of course you made it.

1479
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,880
I got to get bacK to worK.

1480
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,549
- When can I see you again?
- Dr. Pomatter,

1481
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,628
I¡¯ve been thinKing.

1482
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,287
I thinKwe need to end this.

1483
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,796
- No.
- Yes.

1484
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,991
Why?

1485
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,624
Because I feel liKe
a bad person,

1486
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,532
- and I can¡¯t live with that.
-Jenna...

1487
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,002
No, don¡¯t say anything.

1488
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,902
Don¡¯t get all nervous and sweet.

1489
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,304
Don¡¯t talK me out of it.

1490
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,936
Just, please, finish your pie
and go. Please.

1491
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,439
I¡¯m sorry.

1492
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,349
( country music playing low)

1493
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,648
(humming melody)

1494
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,158
Last piece.

1495
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,525
Sold out even faster
than usual today.

1496
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,063
Good on us.

1497
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,598
ThanKs.

1498
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,635
Cal...

1499
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:44,171
Yeah?

1500
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,071
Are you happy?

1501
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,207
I mean, would you call yourself
a happy man?

1502
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,444
Well, if you¡¯re asKing me
a serious question, I¡¯ll tell you.

1503
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,884
I¡¯m happy enough.

1504
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:03,891
I don¡¯t expect much, give much,
I don¡¯t get much.

1505
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,757
I generally enjoy whatever comes up.

1506
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,633
That¡¯s my truth, summed up
for your feminine judgment.

1507
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,168
I¡¯m happy enough.

1508
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,704
Why do you asK?

1509
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,306
No reason.

1510
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,079
(humming)

1511
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,854
OGI E:
Good evening.

1512
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,830
Good evening.

1513
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,403
I¡¯m just waiting on Dawn.

1514
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,336
Hmm.

1515
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,103
TaKing her to Stanton
for a steaK dinner.

1516
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,872
Gonna be asKing her to marry me.

1517
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,276
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1518
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,281
There you are.

1519
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,745
Dawn, if I had a penny for
everything I loved about you,

1520
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,116
I would have many pennies.

1521
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,680
(gasps): He¡¯s-He¡¯s maKing me
a poem right here.

1522
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,783
Penny for your teeth,

1523
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:16,024
penny for your nose,
penny for your eyes, penny

1524
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:20,193
for your hair, your navel,
penny for your odor.

1525
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,270
A dollar for your heart.

1526
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,636
Aw, Ogie, thanKyou.

1527
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,141
That sure is sweet.

1528
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,276
You two have a good time, you hear?

1529
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,650
Oh, we will.

1530
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:40,881
Bye.

1531
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,117
Where we going?

1532
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:50,993
Waiting for Earl?

1533
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,398
Yeah.

1534
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,665
Hey, I¡¯m real sorry
for what I said before.

1535
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:00,173
Listen, I love you no matter what you do.

1536
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,141
OKay.

1537
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,142
OKay.

1538
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,143
I forgive you.

1539
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,144
Good.

1540
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,147
Good.

1541
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,911
¡¯Cause this is my little adventure.

1542
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,043
Your little adventure?

1543
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,051
Yeah.

1544
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:13,587
I¡¯m having me a little adventure

1545
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,418
after many years of lots of nothing.

1546
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:16,991
You love him?

1547
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,561
Cal?

1548
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,892
I don¡¯t Know.

1549
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,589
But I love it.

1550
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,032
I love having someone
to looK pretty for.

1551
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:31,004
I love waKing up and having
something to looK forward to.

1552
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,009
Something fun and sneaKy and sexy.

1553
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,305
He love you?

1554
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,470
He Kind of liKes me.

1555
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,707
He Kind of hates me.

1556
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,146
It¡¯s fun.

1557
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,309
It doesn¡¯t sound very fun.

1558
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,351
He maKes me forget

1559
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,445
about my invalid husband,
my loneliness,

1560
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:51,219
the dreadful misplacement
of my bosoms.

1561
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,922
BecKy, I don¡¯t Know how
to tell you this,

1562
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,191
but your bosoms are fine.

1563
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,789
There ain¡¯t nothing wrong with them.

1564
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,890
It¡¯s all in your head.

1565
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,560
What are you talKing about?
Are you blind?

1566
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,103
This one¡¯s way up here in Maine,

1567
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,695
this one¡¯s dangling
down here in Florida.

1568
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,641
(horn honKing)

1569
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,678
All right, well,
I¡¯ll see you tomorrow, honey.

1570
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,213
No, you won¡¯t.
Tomorrow¡¯s Thursday, my day off.

1571
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,282
Then I¡¯ll see you Friday?

1572
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,408
Yeah.

1573
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,647
(both chucKle)

1574
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:20,653
All right, bye.

1575
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:21,723
Bye.

1576
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,060
Hey, PorKy.

1577
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,630
Hey.

1578
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,231
Why don¡¯t you treat me liKe a man?

1579
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,503
I don¡¯t feel liKe it.

1580
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,675
¡°¡°I don¡¯t feel liKe it.¡¯¡¯

1581
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:51,549
Well, what maKes you thinK
you have that option, hmm?

1582
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,755
Earl.

1583
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,846
Stop.

1584
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,984
Come on.
Don¡¯t tell me to stop.

1585
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,288
Hmm, come on.

1586
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,921
I feed you.

1587
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,195
I pay for this house.

1588
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,271
I put clothes on your bacK.

1589
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,305
Come on,just do what I tell you.

1590
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,170
I won¡¯t get too mad.

1591
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,743
Earl, that hurts, come on.

1592
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,976
I love you, baby.

1593
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:26,714
I don¡¯t care if you¡¯re fat.

1594
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,556
You¡¯re my sweet thing.

1595
01:10:46,572 --> 01:10:48,096

(doorbell ringing)

1602
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:33,150
What are you doing here?

1603
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,617
I tooK the whole day off.

1604
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:37,348
I don¡¯t Know.

1605
01:11:37,456 --> 01:11:38,855
I wanted to see you.

1606
01:11:38,957 --> 01:11:40,219
You looK awful.

1607
01:11:40,325 --> 01:11:41,815
ThanKs.

1608
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:44,760
I mean, you looK sad.

1609
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:46,990
You looK really sad.

1610
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:50,367
It¡¯s taKen you a long time
to notice this,

1611
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:54,428
but, uh... I¡¯m not a happy woman,
Dr. Pomatter.

1612
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:57,133
And I don¡¯t want you to save me.

1613
01:11:57,242 --> 01:11:58,504
I don¡¯t want to save you.

1614
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,840
Don¡¯t want to be saved.

1615
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:06,315
Can I come in?

1616
01:12:06,418 --> 01:12:08,045
No.

1617
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,048
Yeah.

1618
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,358
So, what now?

1619
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:24,935
I don¡¯t Know.

1620
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:28,336
I thought maybe you could
teach me how to maKe a pie.

1621
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,409
Seriously?

1622
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,738
Seriously.

1623
01:12:32,844 --> 01:12:35,608
I could do that, sure.

1624
01:12:37,215 --> 01:12:39,240
Come here.

1625
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:50,322

** (man singing)

1627
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:55,830
Dear baby.

1628
01:12:55,934 --> 01:12:58,368
I hope someday, somebody
wants to hold you

1629
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:01,871
for 20 minutes straight,
and that¡¯s all they do.

1630
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:03,463
They don¡¯t pull away.

1631
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:05,270
They don¡¯t look at your face.

1632
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,242
They don¡¯t try to kiss you.

1633
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:09,905
All they do is wrap you up
in their arms

1634
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:13,746
and hold on tight without
an ounce of selfishness to it.

** ( continues)

1636

(laughing):
I got it.

1637
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,247
- And now the berries.
- Berries.

1638
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:55,623
OKay, I¡¯m finished.

1639
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:07,737
I can¡¯t let the chocolate burn.

1640
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,908
I love watching you.

1641
01:14:12,811 --> 01:14:15,371
Once the chocolate¡¯s all in,
you¡¯ll pour the berries on top.

1642
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,971
JI M: I¡¯ll pour the berries on top.

1643
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:22,349
Mama used to call this
¡°¡°The Lonely Chicago Pie.¡¯¡¯

1644
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:24,752
She made hundreds of
different Kinds of pie.

1645
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:29,156
They all have real strange names,
liKe ¡°¡°Car Radio Pie¡¯¡¯

1646
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,253
or ¡°¡°Jenna¡¯s First Kiss Pie.¡¯¡¯

1647
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:42,739
Now the berries-you do it.

1648
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:44,570
- OKay.
- Mm-hmm.

1649
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:50,507
You Know, Mama would Keep me in
the Kitchen with her,

1650
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,516
and teach me everything
she Knew about baKing.

1651
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:57,520
She¡¯d sing to me so sweetly.

1652
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:01,786
* Baby, don¡¯t you cry,
gonna maKe a pie *

01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:06,523
* Gonna maKe a pie

1654
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:10,397

gonna maKe for you *

1655
01:15:10,502 --> 01:15:14,598
* Gonna maKe a pie with

1656
01:15:14,706 --> 01:15:17,903
* Gonna be a pie

1657
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:22,537
* Gonna be filled
with strawberry love *

1658
01:15:22,647 --> 01:15:26,708
* Baby, don¡¯t you cry,
gonna maKe a pie *

1659
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:31,619
* Hold you forever in
the middle of my heart. *

1660
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:33,054
You are so beautiful.

1661
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:34,182
No, I¡¯m not.

1662
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:35,384
You are.

1663
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,552
I¡¯m fat.

1664
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:38,686
You¡¯re pregnant.

1665
01:15:38,797 --> 01:15:40,765
You¡¯ve got a little baby
growing inside you.

1666
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:42,595
There is nothing more beautiful.

1667
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:46,000
It¡¯s an alien and a parasite.

1668
01:15:46,104 --> 01:15:48,231
It maKes me tired and weaK.

1669
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,069
It complicates my whole life.

1670
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,733
I resent it.

1671
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:54,710
I have no idea
how to taKe care of it.

1672
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:57,145
I¡¯m the anti-mother.

1673
01:15:57,249 --> 01:16:00,013
I don¡¯t want to talK
about that no more.

1674
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:03,315
I want to Know
what the hell you¡¯re doing here.

1675
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:05,252
I¡¯m learning how to maKe
¡°¡°Lonely Chicago Pie.¡¯¡¯

1676
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:09,418
No, I mean what you¡¯re doing here,
living in this town.

1677
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:12,223
My wife.

1678
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:15,094
She just finished med school and
we came here for her residency.

1679
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,498
Are you happy with her?

1680
01:16:17,602 --> 01:16:21,094
No, don¡¯t answer that.

1681
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,174
I¡¯m happy right now.

1682
01:16:23,275 --> 01:16:24,970
Being here with you.

1683
01:16:25,076 --> 01:16:27,636
That¡¯s a good answer.

1684
01:16:27,746 --> 01:16:30,772
You maKe me feel calm.

1685
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:33,715
You maKe me feel peaceful.

1686
01:16:33,818 --> 01:16:35,308
I don¡¯t feel that much.

1687
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,752
I tend to be neurotic.

1688
01:16:37,856 --> 01:16:40,552
And you¡¯re so beautiful.

1689
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:42,286
Keep going.

1690
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:43,622
And so sexy.

1691
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:44,820
More, please.

1692
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,989
And I could find
the whole meaning of life

1693
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:48,122
in those sad eyes.

1694
01:16:50,802 --> 01:16:52,463
Wow.

1695
01:17:05,483 --> 01:17:06,950
Dear baby.

1696
01:17:07,052 --> 01:17:10,749
Somewhere in the space
between the pie baking

1697
01:17:10,855 --> 01:17:13,688
and Earl eating it
later that night,

1698
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:17,250
began the most intimate
conversation of my life.

1699
01:17:17,362 --> 01:17:20,354
About my mama,
about how much she loved me,

1700
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:23,832
how sad she¡¯d be to see my life
turned out like this.

1701
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:27,393
About Earl and how he changed
after we married,

1702
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:29,996
became someone I feared.

1703
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:34,704
About how lonely it is to be
a woman so poor and so afraid.

1704
01:17:34,813 --> 01:17:37,543
And then I was addicted, baby.

1705
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:39,549
I was addicted
to saying things

1706
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:41,812
and having them matter to someone.

1707
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:50,955
Mm.

1708
01:17:51,062 --> 01:17:55,260
I¡¯ve never had a real best friend before,
except for my mama.

1709
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,834
You feel liKe a best friend.

1710
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:00,694
I have something for you.

1711
01:18:00,805 --> 01:18:02,204
A present.

1712
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:04,036
A present for me?

1713
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:05,074
Yes, for you.

1714
01:18:05,176 --> 01:18:07,337
I hope this is not
some damn baby thing.

1715
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:09,276
No. This is for you.

1716
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,613
- (phone ringing)
- Mm-hmm...

1717
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,346
Excuse me.

1718
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:17,853
Hello.

1719
01:18:17,956 --> 01:18:19,753
OKay.

1720
01:18:19,858 --> 01:18:22,258
OKay.

1721
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,225
Yes. No, Mrs. Hesdra,

1722
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:26,297
I thinK that¡¯ll be fine.
No,just Keep taKing

1723
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:29,060
the painKillers I gave you
a-and stay on the antibiotics.

1724
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,032
Oh, my God.

1725
01:18:31,136 --> 01:18:32,535
No, no, that¡¯s fine.

1726
01:18:32,637 --> 01:18:34,195
No,just...

1727
01:18:34,305 --> 01:18:35,704
Right. If you have
any more problems,

1728
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:36,967
just call me in two days.

1729
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:38,474
OKay. You¡¯re welcome.

1730
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:39,736
TaKe care.

1731
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:41,402
(hangs up)

1732
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:42,980
Do you liKe it?

1733
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:48,648
It¡¯s the most beautiful
thing I¡¯ve ever seen.

1734
01:18:48,753 --> 01:18:50,584
I had it made for you.

1735
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,246
It must have cost a fortune.

1736
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:53,381
No, not really.

1737
01:18:53,491 --> 01:18:54,753
You shouldn¡¯t have done this.

1738
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:57,794
I can¡¯t buy you nothing bacK.

1739
01:18:57,896 --> 01:19:00,456
I don¡¯t want you to buy me anything.

1740
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:04,433
Why¡¯d you give this
to me, Dr. Pomatter?

1741
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,060
You Know why.

1742
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:08,071
No, I don¡¯t.

1743
01:19:09,841 --> 01:19:11,069
Because I am falling

1744
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:13,235
head over heels...

1745
01:19:22,253 --> 01:19:26,849
(fiddle and banjo playing

1746
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:45,169
(sobbing)

1747
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:49,780
MI NISTER:
We¡¯re gathered here today

1748
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:52,372
to celebrate the love
between Ogie Anhorn

1749
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:55,214
and Dawn Williams...
to join them together

1750
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,515
in holy matrimony for
the rest of their natural lives.

1751
01:19:57,622 --> 01:19:58,850
Can I say something?

1752
01:20:00,225 --> 01:20:02,352
Sure.

1753
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:07,329
Spontaneous wedding poetry,
right now.

1754
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:11,160
The title is ¡°¡°Yes.¡¯¡¯

1755
01:20:11,269 --> 01:20:16,172
Dawn, every time I looK
at you, I thinKyes,

1756
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:19,175
yes, we¡¯re driven by true love.

1757
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:21,575
Yes, I¡¯m more than just he who audits.

1758
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:28,278
Yes, I¡¯m poetry and I¡¯m sex,
and I¡¯m living a dream.

1759
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:30,354
I am, from now on,

1760
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:33,151
whoever you need me to be.

1761
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:37,888
Yes, yes, yes.

1762
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:41,493
Oh, Ogie.

1763
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:44,832
(applause and cheering)

1764
01:20:44,936 --> 01:20:47,837
( up-tempo country music playing)

1765
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:54,977
** (man singing)

1766
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:06,281
** ( continues)

1767
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,794
This reminds me of my third wedding.

1768
01:21:13,898 --> 01:21:14,956
Terry Lynn Lemon.

1769
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:16,556
She had big ones.

1770
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:19,796
Joe, that¡¯s not a very
respectful thing to say.

1771
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:22,065
I¡¯m just pointing out
her good qualities.

1772
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:23,401
She was nasty.

1773
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:24,873
I¡¯m going to invent

1774
01:21:24,976 --> 01:21:29,811
a special pie for you called
¡°¡°Old Joe¡¯s Horny Past Pie.¡¯¡¯

1775
01:21:29,914 --> 01:21:32,382
Have to wait a bit, I¡¯m afraid.

1776
01:21:32,483 --> 01:21:34,348
- I¡¯m going in the hospital next weeK.
- Oh.

1777
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:35,578
Liver stuff.

1778
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:37,814
Got to have a piece of it removed.

1779
01:21:37,922 --> 01:21:39,480
Maybe I¡¯ll even die.

1780
01:21:39,591 --> 01:21:41,889
Don¡¯t be stupid.
You won¡¯t die.

1781
01:21:41,993 --> 01:21:45,485
(pop ballad playing)

1782
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:53,970
If I¡¯d ever met a girl
liKe you,Jenna,

1783
01:21:54,072 --> 01:21:57,769
my whole life could
have been different.

1784
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:03,303
You don¡¯t even Know
what you are deep inside.

1785
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:06,440
You¡¯re not just
some little waitress.

1786
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:09,247
You understand what I¡¯m saying?

1787
01:22:09,354 --> 01:22:11,447
Not at all, no.

1788
01:22:11,556 --> 01:22:16,858
I¡¯m saying, my whole life
I spent lost.

1789
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:19,623
If a sign said ¡°¡°go this way,¡¯¡¯
I¡¯d go the other way.

1790
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:23,030
Time after time after time.

1791
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:25,932
I turned the wrong corner,
made the wrong choice,

1792
01:22:26,037 --> 01:22:30,667
went the wrong way,
liKe a chicKen without a head.

1793
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:32,140
You understand?

1794
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,711
You was a chicKen without a head?

1795
01:22:34,812 --> 01:22:38,043
Pie lady, listen to me.

1796
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,640
This life will Kill you.

1797
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:42,811
I¡¯m saying...

1798
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,911
maKe the right choice.

1799
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:46,547
Start fresh.

1800
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:48,125
It¡¯s never too late.

1801
01:22:48,226 --> 01:22:49,693
Start fresh.

1802
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:53,321
I ain¡¯t got no money,Joe.

1803
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:56,491
Who the hell does anymore?

1804
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:59,900
And I¡¯m about to have me a baby.

1805
01:23:00,004 --> 01:23:02,939
I Know you are,Jenna.

1806
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,601
I Know you are.

1807
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:09,009
I was just dreaming
a little for you,

1808
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:12,981
¡¯cause... all my dreams is gone.

1809
01:23:14,519 --> 01:23:16,487
(horn honKing continuously)

1810
01:23:16,587 --> 01:23:17,611
Oh, no.

1811
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,340
( clattering)

1812
01:23:37,442 --> 01:23:38,739
(gasping and murmuring)

1813
01:23:38,843 --> 01:23:40,811
(music stops)

1814
01:23:40,912 --> 01:23:42,812
Jenna...

1815
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:46,611
I¡¯m very upset with you.

1816
01:23:46,718 --> 01:23:49,084
I¡¯ll be waiting in the car.

1817
01:23:49,187 --> 01:23:52,748
You have 30 seconds to get
your ass in gear and join me.

1818
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:54,950
30 seconds!

1819
01:23:57,495 --> 01:23:59,360
(door slams)

1820
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:03,732
You wasn¡¯t exaggerating.

1821
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:05,325
Your husband is terrible.

1822
01:24:05,436 --> 01:24:07,336
DAWN:
Jenna...

1823
01:24:07,438 --> 01:24:09,668
- Honey, congratulations.
- OKay,Jenna.

1824
01:24:09,774 --> 01:24:11,901
I¡¯ll talK to you later, oKay?

1825
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:20,649
Earl...

1826
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:22,652
No, you don¡¯t say nothing.

1827
01:24:22,754 --> 01:24:24,779
You don¡¯t say one word.

1828
01:24:24,889 --> 01:24:27,016
Not one word.

1829
01:24:29,293 --> 01:24:31,022
You just sit there.

1830
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,755
Earl, that hurts.

1831
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:36,663
Open the cabinet

1832
01:24:36,768 --> 01:24:38,759
where the coffee
and the sugar jars are.

1833
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,962
I don¡¯t want...

1834
01:24:40,071 --> 01:24:41,800
Just open it!

1835
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:46,839
What is that?

1836
01:24:46,944 --> 01:24:48,969
Jenna, what is that?

1837
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,274
Money.

1838
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:52,008
It¡¯s all over the fucKing house!

1839
01:24:52,116 --> 01:24:53,947
In cabinets, in drawers,

1840
01:24:54,051 --> 01:24:56,212
under chairs, in closets!

1841
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,619
Money hidden all over my house!

1842
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:00,691
(whispers):
I¡¯m sorry...

1843
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:02,726
Yeah, after everything
I¡¯ve done for you...

1844
01:25:02,827 --> 01:25:05,523
you go and hide money from me?

1845
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:06,790
I¡¯m sorry.

1846
01:25:06,898 --> 01:25:09,264
(sobbing)

1847
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:27,684
You¡¯re the only thing
I ever loved,Jenna.

1848
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:33,386
And you¡¯re the only person
to ever belong to me.

1849
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:36,824
And you having a secret from me,

1850
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:38,589
it tears me up.

1851
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:43,829
Why was you hiding money
all over the house?

1852
01:25:45,736 --> 01:25:47,363
I don¡¯t Know.

1853
01:25:50,007 --> 01:25:53,067
Tell me you was going
to buy me a present.

1854
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:55,873
I was going to buy you a present.

1855
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,677
Tell me you was going
to su... surprise me.

1856
01:25:59,784 --> 01:26:02,184
I was going to surprise you.

1857
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:06,249
Just hold me.

1858
01:26:08,893 --> 01:26:11,054
(sobbing)

1859
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:20,560
(sniffles)

1860
01:26:20,671 --> 01:26:22,161
Truth is, Earl...

1861
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:30,543
Truth is, I was saving that money...

1862
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:32,707
for the baby.

1863
01:26:32,817 --> 01:26:35,581
I was going to buy
some nice things-

1864
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:37,381
a crib,

1865
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:41,618
toys, layette-
it was all for the baby.

1866
01:26:43,494 --> 01:26:45,860
It was for the baby?

1867
01:26:45,963 --> 01:26:47,555
Yeah, so I could buy a crib.

1868
01:26:50,535 --> 01:26:52,366
Yeah.

1869
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:59,235
Baby, I want us to...
I want us to be happy.

1870
01:27:02,713 --> 01:27:05,181
I want us to be happy,Jenna.

1871
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:11,520
(sniffling)

1872
01:27:14,559 --> 01:27:16,459
Dear damn baby...

1873
01:27:16,561 --> 01:27:18,358
If¡¯n you ever want
to know the story

1874
01:27:18,462 --> 01:27:20,930
ofhow we bought your damn crib,
I will tell you.

1875
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:23,296
Your crib was bought
with the money

1876
01:27:23,401 --> 01:27:25,665
that was supposed
to buy me a new life.

1877
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,204
Every time I lay you down
in that damn crib,

1878
01:27:28,306 --> 01:27:29,295
I¡¯m going to think,

1879
01:27:29,407 --> 01:27:32,137
¡°Damn baby, damn crib.

1880
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:35,337
Me stuck like a pin
in this damn life. ¡¯¡±

1881
01:27:35,446 --> 01:27:37,243
( car door closing)

1882
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:39,043
Hey, guess what, sugar?

1883
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:41,744
We got enough money left,
I can buy me a nice video camera.

1884
01:27:41,852 --> 01:27:44,218
Film you being pregnant,
the birth, film the baby.

1885
01:27:44,322 --> 01:27:46,347
Maybe when you get
a figure bacKwe can maKe

1886
01:27:46,457 --> 01:27:49,620
a few nasty tapes,
if you Know what I mean.

1887
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:52,195
Sounds wonderful, Earl.

1888
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:06,100
Sit up for me,Jenna.

1889
01:28:16,253 --> 01:28:19,017
(Velcro cuff tearing)

1890
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:31,129
I wish I could stop everything
and run away with you.

1891
01:28:31,235 --> 01:28:33,863
Me, too.

1892
01:28:33,971 --> 01:28:36,462
Where could we go?

1893
01:28:36,574 --> 01:28:38,542
I would go in a second.
I would drop everything.

1894
01:28:38,643 --> 01:28:40,873
MaKe it go away.

1895
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:44,847
What?

1896
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:47,474
Everything else in my life.

1897
01:28:56,927 --> 01:28:59,122
That¡¯s a normal reading.

1898
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,925
Jenna, get dressed.

1899
01:29:05,036 --> 01:29:06,731
Meet me outside.

1900
01:29:06,837 --> 01:29:08,998
I¡¯ll be there in 1 0 minutes.

1901
01:29:09,106 --> 01:29:11,700
We¡¯re going someplace.

1902
01:29:11,809 --> 01:29:14,835
We might even run away.

1903
01:29:14,945 --> 01:29:18,676
We¡¯ll figure it out.

1904
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:20,410
I mean it.

1905
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,944
(boy laughing)

1906
01:29:24,055 --> 01:29:25,682
( classical music)

1907
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,883
WOMAN:
Don¡¯t you spray me! Don¡¯t you dare spray me!

1908
01:29:27,992 --> 01:29:29,960
Hunter, no!

1909
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:31,756
No! No!

1910
01:29:31,862 --> 01:29:33,227
What did I say?

1911
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,356
- (boy laughing)
- Hunter, no!

1912
01:29:37,601 --> 01:29:39,569
Nobody ever tells you beforehand

1913
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:41,900
how ridiculously hard
it¡¯s going to be.

1914
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:45,468
- Come on, Hunter.
- (laughing)

1915
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:12,696
Dr. Pomatter, I believe
my water just broKe.

1916
01:30:14,672 --> 01:30:17,664
(inhales deeply, then exhales)

1917
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:28,347
Hey, sweetheart.

1918
01:30:28,452 --> 01:30:32,252
Oh, Dr. Pomatter,
this is my husband, Earl.

1919
01:30:32,356 --> 01:30:33,948
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1920
01:30:34,058 --> 01:30:35,616
Nice to meet you, Doc.

1921
01:30:35,726 --> 01:30:38,388
Excuse me, but could you
get up from that chair

1922
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:41,192
- so I could sit next to my wife?
- Right.

1923
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:48,705
I would have brought you

1924
01:30:48,806 --> 01:30:51,502
some candy or flowers,
but I didn¡¯t have no time.

1925
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:52,769
That¡¯s oKay, Earl.

1926
01:30:52,877 --> 01:30:55,505
I need you to rest now,Jenna.
Big moment coming soon.

1927
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,843
I¡¯ll leave you folKs
to your privacy. Excuse me.

1928
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:00,439
- Dr. Pomatter...
- Yes,Jenna.

1929
01:31:00,551 --> 01:31:02,576
I just want to maKe sure we¡¯re
clear about one thing.

1930
01:31:02,686 --> 01:31:04,950
- What¡¯s that,Jenna?
- I want drugs.

1931
01:31:05,055 --> 01:31:07,046
I want massive amounts of drugs.

1932
01:31:07,158 --> 01:31:09,353
I want the maximum
legal limit of drugs.

1933
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:12,122
Noted and understood.

1934
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:14,060
Oh, do... do you belong here?

1935
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:15,189
Yeah, I¡¯m Kin.

1936
01:31:15,299 --> 01:31:17,290
Joe, hi!

1937
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:20,493
You having your surgery today?

1938
01:31:20,604 --> 01:31:22,367
Later this afternoon.

1939
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:24,407
Cal told me you were here.

1940
01:31:24,508 --> 01:31:26,305
Here, I bought you this card.

1941
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,537
It¡¯s silly.
LooK at it later, after all

1942
01:31:28,646 --> 01:31:29,544
the fuss is over.

1943
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:30,909
- ThanKs.
- Put it right next

1944
01:31:31,015 --> 01:31:32,880
- to you on the nightstand.
- I will.

1945
01:31:32,983 --> 01:31:34,575
I remember you.

1946
01:31:34,685 --> 01:31:36,380
You¡¯re the husband.

1947
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:37,977
Yeah, I¡¯m the husband.

1948
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:40,648
LucKy for you, I didn¡¯t taKe
money out ofJenna¡¯s checK

1949
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:43,386
for all the damage you did
in my diner at that wedding.

1950
01:31:43,494 --> 01:31:46,019
Don¡¯t say nothing smart-ass.

1951
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:47,722
I¡¯m leaving.

1952
01:31:47,832 --> 01:31:49,231
Give me a hug first.

1953
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,459
Absolutely not.

1954
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:54,970

Earl, if you don¡¯t

1957
01:31:58,642 --> 01:32:01,907
put that stinKing camera away,
I¡¯m going to smash it.

Earl!

1960
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,746
All right, all right.
(laughing)

1961

(breathing heavily)

1962
01:32:12,957 --> 01:32:14,447
You¡¯re doing great, sweetheart.

1963
01:32:17,061 --> 01:32:18,426
You¡¯re doing great.

1964
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:19,723
What am I doing?

1965
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:22,264
Try and steady your breathing, hon.

1966
01:32:22,366 --> 01:32:24,334
Hi. I¡¯m Francine Pomatter.

1967
01:32:24,435 --> 01:32:25,959
Jim¡¯s told me so much about you.

1968
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,904
He thinKs you¡¯re just
a terrific woman.

1969
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:31,235
So you must be.

1970
01:32:31,342 --> 01:32:32,707
Did I mention my wife
is a resident here?

1971
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:35,472
I thinKyou might have
mentioned that.

1972
01:32:35,579 --> 01:32:38,912
He¡¯s so proud of me.
He tells everybody.

1973
01:32:39,016 --> 01:32:41,712
She going to be here
through the whole delivery?

1974
01:32:41,819 --> 01:32:44,845
I mean, are all the residents
going to be here?

1975
01:32:44,955 --> 01:32:46,115
No, no, they were just here

1976
01:32:46,223 --> 01:32:47,781
to witness the administration of the epidural.

1977
01:32:47,892 --> 01:32:49,223
So I¡¯m clearing the room now.

1978
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:50,350
So everybody out.

1979
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:58,226
She¡¯s fully dilated, Doctor.
I thinK it¡¯s time for her to push.

EARL:
How do you liKe that?

1995
01:33:43,747 --> 01:33:47,911
Would you liKe to cut the cord,
Mr. Hunterson?

1996
01:33:48,018 --> 01:33:50,316
Yeah. Why not?

Mrs. Hunterson.
Did you hear me?

2001

Are you oKay?

2002

2004
01:34:20,117 --> 01:34:21,744
Give her to me.

Hey.

Do you remember what I said?

2013
01:35:28,152 --> 01:35:30,985
Don¡¯t you go loving
that baby too much.

2014

I don¡¯t love you, Earl.

I haven¡¯t loved you for years.

2016
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:36,054
I want a divorce.

If you ever come

I will flatten your sorry ass,

with us for a while till
you get bacK on your feet.

2042
01:37:06,517 --> 01:37:07,916
You could stay with us,

2043
01:37:08,018 --> 01:37:10,578
but I thought Phil¡¯s convulsions
might frighten the baby.

Oh, I got to see that baby!

Lulu, the love of my life.

Hon, we have some bad news for you.

2052
01:37:28,505 --> 01:37:30,439
Old Joe was admitted
to the hospital

2053
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:31,439
same day you were.

2054
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:33,271
No, I Know, he came by

2055
01:37:33,377 --> 01:37:34,275
to see me.

2056
01:37:34,378 --> 01:37:36,869
Well, he¡¯s not doing so well.

2057
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,845
In fact, he went into a coma

2058
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:40,940
and they don¡¯t thinK
he¡¯s going to recover.

No! Oh, poorJoe.

I Know you liKe him.

2061

You¡¯re probably the only person alive

No, he¡¯s dear.

2065
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,887
He came in, he gave me this card.

2066
01:37:54,998 --> 01:37:57,626
Where¡¯d I put that?

2067
01:37:57,734 --> 01:38:00,635
I set it down right over here.

2068
01:38:00,737 --> 01:38:03,570
- LooK at the baby. LooK at that.
- She¡¯s so cute.

2069
01:38:03,674 --> 01:38:06,575
Oh, the tiniest little hands.

2070
01:38:06,677 --> 01:38:08,406
LooK at the little nose.

2071
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,706
Oh, she¡¯s pretty.

2072
01:38:09,813 --> 01:38:11,906
-Jenna, she¡¯s real pretty.
-Jenna, she¡¯s...

2073
01:38:14,051 --> 01:38:16,417
* Little girl, little girl *

2074
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,250
* Little baby girl *

2075
01:38:19,356 --> 01:38:21,824
* We love that baby girl *

2076
01:38:21,925 --> 01:38:24,587
* She¡¯s the cutest baby in... *

2077
01:38:24,695 --> 01:38:26,959
* *

2078
01:38:30,434 --> 01:38:33,403
( chucKles)

2079
01:38:39,743 --> 01:38:44,146
( coughing)

2080
01:38:44,248 --> 01:38:46,478
Is it a nice card?

2081
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:50,619
Yeah, it¡¯s oKay.

2082
01:38:50,721 --> 01:38:52,188
He made me a drawing.

2083
01:38:52,289 --> 01:38:53,313
You want to see it?

2084
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:55,118
Yeah, oKay.

2085
01:38:59,229 --> 01:39:00,594

01:39:00,697 --> 01:39:01,595

01:39:04,368 --> 01:39:06,461
It¡¯s pretty nice.

2089
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,868
Jenna?

2090
01:39:08,972 --> 01:39:10,599
Jenna, where you going?

2091
01:39:10,707 --> 01:39:13,141
Oh, they¡¯re KicKing me out.

2092
01:39:13,243 --> 01:39:14,301
Uh, ladies, would you mind

2093
01:39:14,411 --> 01:39:16,345
if I had a minute
alone with my patient

2094
01:39:16,446 --> 01:39:18,073
to talK to her before she leaves?

2095
01:39:18,181 --> 01:39:19,079
Oh...

2096
01:39:19,182 --> 01:39:20,376

2098
01:39:22,185 --> 01:39:23,345
Oh, goodness.

2099
01:39:23,453 --> 01:39:25,978
Come here, baby.
Come here, little baby.

2100
01:39:26,089 --> 01:39:29,616
You come see Aunt BecKy.
You come see Aunt BecKy.

2101
01:39:29,726 --> 01:39:30,852
Oh, my goodness.

01:39:30,961 --> 01:39:32,258

OKay.

2104
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:36,497
LooK at you.

2105
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,431
Dawn, looK at her face.

2106
01:39:44,408 --> 01:39:45,534
I Know what you¡¯re thinKing.

2107
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:49,373
No, I don¡¯t. That¡¯s a lie.

2108
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:50,878
What are you thinKing?

2109
01:39:50,981 --> 01:39:56,180
I¡¯m thinKing...
I could never thanKyou enough

2110
01:39:56,286 --> 01:39:58,516
for everything you¡¯ve done for me.

2111
01:39:58,622 --> 01:40:01,318
I¡¯m thinKing
your wife¡¯s around

2112
01:40:01,425 --> 01:40:02,983
and you probably shouldn¡¯t Kiss me.

2113
01:40:03,093 --> 01:40:05,857
The way she looKs at you,

2114
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:08,692
so much trust.

2115
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:14,470
So that¡¯s it?

2116
01:40:14,571 --> 01:40:16,539
It¡¯s over?
I don¡¯t have any say in this?

2117
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:20,076
We could have a big drama here
that gets drawn out for a couple years,

2118
01:40:20,177 --> 01:40:21,474
maKes everyone miserable.

2119
01:40:21,578 --> 01:40:26,072
Or we could just end it
right here, you Know?

2120
01:40:26,183 --> 01:40:28,845
No body count,just say bye-bye.

2121
01:40:30,454 --> 01:40:32,945
I¡¯m saying bye-bye.

2122
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:37,692
Dawn, wheel me off now, oKay?

2123
01:40:37,794 --> 01:40:38,886
DAWN:

2124
01:40:38,995 --> 01:40:40,860

2125
01:40:40,964 --> 01:40:42,556

2130
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:21,329
Oh, nothing.
I just had an affair with him.

2131

I just ended it for good.

2135
01:41:29,012 --> 01:41:31,173
Here, give Lulu to me.

2136
01:41:31,281 --> 01:41:33,408
OKay. Go see your mommy.
