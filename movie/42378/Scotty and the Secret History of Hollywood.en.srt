1
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,516
- [Answering Machine]
Two new messages.

2
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:51,351
Message one.

3
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,687
- [Bernardo] Hi,
Scotty, it's Bernardo.

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,855
I got your message.

5
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:59,292
So call me any time you want
to see me or get together.

6
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,593
We look forward to seeing you.

7
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,298
(birds chirping)

8
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,799
- Bernardo took me shopping.

9
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:10,570
I mean, I paid for it, but
he took me shopping. (laughs)

10
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,839
Bernardo insisted that
I have a handkerchief

11
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,140
for the pocket too.

12
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,211
Jeez, I hope it fits.

13
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,482
- [Matt] When was
the last time Scotty

14
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,583
was dressed like this?

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,718
- When we got married.

16
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:28,387
(Scotty laughs)

17
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,255
Hey!

18
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,758
(&quot;It had to be
you&quot; instrumental)

19
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,762
- [Scotty] You look
so pretty, honey.

20
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,472
- This is the birthday man.

21
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,675
- Happy Birthday, Scotty!
- He only looks a day over 50.

22
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:54,514
(&quot;It had to be
you&quot; instrumental)

23
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,616
- [Man] Andreas, for 40 years.

24
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,885
- You're looking wonderful.

25
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,686
We're talking about the
Gomorrah of Hollywood.

26
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,553
- Talking about what?

27
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:04,824
- [Woman] The
Gomorrah of Hollywood.

28
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:05,691
- It's amazing!

29
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:07,293
Can you believe it?

30
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,761
- He must've lived his
life in a good way,

31
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,396
because look at him,
and he's 90 years old.

32
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,732
- I'm telling you, he worked
every day of his life.

33
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,801
And God knows he partied,
you've read his book.

34
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:20,206
(&quot;It Had to be
You&quot; instrumental)

35
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,946
- Are you still working?

36
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,615
(laughs) We wanna know
if you're still working.

37
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:30,917
- You might say that.

38
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,586
- [Man] Scotty?

39
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,821
Oh, Scott, where are you?

40
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,357
I think there's something with
your name on it over here.

41
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,861
(lively instrumental music)

42
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:48,835
- [Crowd] Yay!

43
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,772
- [Man] 90 and still going!

44
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:56,909
- Happy birthday, Scotty.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:58,811
That was so nice of you.

46
00:02:58,844 --> 00:02:59,946
- It wasn't until
I started working

47
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,414
my book on Katharine Hepburn.

48
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,683
I was talking to some of
the other biographers,

49
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,651
and they said to me,

50
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,518
&quot;You know, there's this
character out there

51
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,486
&quot;that you really
should try to talk to,

52
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,655
&quot;and his name is Scotty Bowers.

53
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:12,725
&quot;And he had this
gas station, and he,

54
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,594
&quot;you know, he
supplied men and women

55
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,828
&quot;to the various Hollywood stars.

56
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,530
&quot;He knew, he knows
all about that era,

57
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,531
&quot;but you know, you'll
never get to talk to him.&quot;

58
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:22,635
I began to think that maybe
he was an urban legend.

59
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,804
(laughs) You know, that
there was no Scotty Bowers.

60
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,906
(lively horn music)

61
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,743
- Did you have a
little black book?

62
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,711
- No.
- No?

63
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,646
You kept it all in your head?
- Yes, yes.

64
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,414
- Some people have described you

65
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,749
as a sort of pimp to the stairs.

66
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:37,883
- [Scotty] Oh, yes.

67
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,552
- [Anthony] In the book you say

68
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:40,786
you were just trying
to help people out.

69
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,355
- Yes, I was.

70
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,789
- [Anthony] But the risks,

71
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:47,694
particularly for gay or
bisexual actors, were serious.

72
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,797
- [Scotty] I met Cary Grant
first, then Randolph Scott.

73
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,700
Back in those days, people
knew they were lovers.

74
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:55,901
- I've lost my clothes.

75
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,337
- But why are you
wearing these clothes?

76
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,841
- Because I just went
gay all of a sudden!

77
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,011
- People are very invested
in the establishment view

78
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,613
of Hollywood movie star history,

79
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:11,784
which Scotty's story
re-tells in an honest way

80
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,354
and in a way that's more
true to what was going on.

81
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:18,491
- [Scotty] 90% of jobs could
be lost from being gay.

82
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:20,793
You were in the
closet, basically.

83
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:21,994
So many people were.

84
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,697
This is why what I
did in the gas station

85
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,699
was so nice for people.

86
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,801
- You don't think this
thing is gonna get around?

87
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,903
You don't think everybody's
gonna know about it?

88
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,406
I won't even be able to
show my face in Lindy's.

89
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,508
- People get very
angry at the idea

90
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,610
of these beloved Hollywood icons

91
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,512
being revealed to have secrets.

92
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,914
But actually, all it
is that Scotty is doing

93
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,550
is revealing that
these people were real.

94
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,785
They were actual people.

95
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,654
Flesh and blood, like us.

96
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,557
- It turned out that
Scotty was the center

97
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,359
of a whole different
alternate world.

98
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:58,563
A world to which most of us
had no access or knowledge.

99
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,600
- It can add up to an
awful lot of people,

100
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,436
when you stop and
think about it.

101
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,872
You would say, each
day, 365 days a year.

102
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,607
It's certainly
into the thousands.

103
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,742
And it's hard to
believe a lot of people

104
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,945
who've only been with two
or three different people

105
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,380
would never believe it.

106
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:18,383
(slow dramatic music)

107
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,866
(birds chirping)

108
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,710
&quot;Dear Scotty.

109
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,445
&quot;What a read, what a life.

110
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,647
&quot;A group of Hollywood's
best writers

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,884
&quot;could not have made up the
life you actually lived.&quot;

112
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,820
- Really gets one who
doesn't like the book.

113
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,422
- &quot;I believe every
word you wrote.

114
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,890
&quot;Why would you lie?

115
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:00,426
&quot;God, I wish I'd lived
next door to you.&quot;

116
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,694
- 'Cause those would be the ones

117
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,397
that you would think
would let him have it.

118
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,832
Both girls, but not a one.

119
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,936
And yet I know there are
people who don't like the book.

120
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,171
The lady that cuts
your hair told me.

121
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,873
- [Scotty] Yeah,
but she's guessing.

122
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,510
She doesn't know anybody--
- No, she, not guessing.

123
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,911
- [Scotty] She told
you there are people

124
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,845
that don't like the book?

125
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,113
- Because it, yeah, I told you

126
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,415
that you took away their dream.

127
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,383
Shame on you.

128
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,752
- You know, there's a new
book called Full Service.

129
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,655
It's written by a man who
says he used to set up gay

130
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:32,758
and bisexual affairs for
some of the biggest stars

131
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,560
from the 1940s and beyond.

132
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,730
- The point of this is,
these people are now dead.

133
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,030
They cannot answer.
- Right.

134
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,000
- Some of them have families.

135
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,435
Is it right?

136
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,069
Do you out people
after they're dead?

137
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:44,770
- Why?

138
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:45,604
What does it, what does it, no,

139
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:46,671
you do care because
they got family.

140
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,808
- The point is it's their
business and not yours.

141
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:49,809
You shouldn't out someone
when they're alive

142
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,176
and you shouldn't out
them when they're dead.

143
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:51,878
How's that?

144
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,812
You shouldn't out them any time

145
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,613
unless it's you saying
it about yourself.

146
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:55,915
- Unless they gave
their permission.

147
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,883
- [Whoopi] Yes, yes!

148
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,456
- That's kinda pretty out there.

149
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,924
I mean, with the sun in
the background over there.

150
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,061
Jesus, look at that
beautiful rainbow.

151
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,329
I created the
rainbow in Hollywood.

152
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:16,068
The Rainbow is at 5777 Hollywood
Boulevard called Richfield,

153
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,770
and that was a rainbow,

154
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:20,673
that was the fuckin' end of a
rainbow for a lot of people.

155
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,242
I mean, it's hard to believe
unless you were there,

156
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,878
how much fun that
gas station was.

157
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,546
People disappearing
up in the trailer

158
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,248
and going in the washroom
and doing this and that.

159
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,717
The whole thing
was fun. (laughs)

160
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,987
(soft piano music)

161
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,089
5777 Hollywood Boulevard.

162
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,926
And the streetcar used to go
along Hollywood Boulevard,

163
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,995
ding, ding, ding,
and stop right there

164
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,798
in front of the gas station,
which was very nice.

165
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,868
Where the gas station was

166
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,504
is a huge three-story
firehouse there now.

167
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,707
Now, see, that's their
property, came right to here,

168
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,175
went straight back to
that corner and down.

169
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,576
And the gas station
was a little thing,

170
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,512
it was no higher where, where,

171
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,847
than those letters
that say fire station.

172
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,816
It's so completely different now

173
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,719
that it's hard to
believe what it was then.

174
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,756
(lively jazz music)

175
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,695
That period of time
after World War II,

176
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:20,132
that was quite a different
time, never to be repeated.

177
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,068
Remember, had the
war not come along,

178
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,204
people lived on the farm
and still be on the farm,

179
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,539
like myself.

180
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,941
I went in the Marine
Corps when I was 18.

181
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:33,178
My brother went in the Marine
Corps two years after I did.

182
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:37,249
I was in '42, '43,
'44, and most of '45.

183
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:40,886
(slow soft music)

184
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,588
When you're overseas,
you're a long ways away,

185
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,794
and how many guys
get killed every day,

186
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,198
and you're burying
people all the time.

187
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,068
(slow soft music)

188
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:00,239
You think, you do think you're
never gonna get back home.

189
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,909
(crowd cheering)

190
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,312
When the war was over
in '45, many guys,

191
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,013
when they got out
of the service,

192
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,883
they went back home again to
the little town, to the farm.

193
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:16,989
I upgraded myself and went
to Hollywood. (laughs)

194
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,191
(slow soft orchestral music)

195
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:21,327
I went and got the job
at the gas station.

196
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,130
(bell dings)

197
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:28,834
The very first person I
met at the gas station

198
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:29,801
was Walter Pidgeon.

199
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,204
It happened purely accidental.

200
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,109
He drove in, in a nice
Lincoln Continental.

201
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,313
It was a hot day, and
he was a real gentleman.

202
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,084
- [Matt] Did you
know who he was?

203
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,117
- [Scotty] Not really.

204
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,954
I just thought he
was a nice guy.

205
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:53,391
He said, &quot;What is a
nice-looking guy like you

206
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,093
&quot;doing working in
the gas station?&quot;

207
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,729
That type of thing. (laughs)

208
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,199
&quot;It'd be nice to have you come
and take a dip in the pool,&quot;

209
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,367
and things like that.

210
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,736
I got into the car
and left with him.

211
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,106
(slow soft jazz music)

212
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,378
- [Matt] That day at
the pool, what happened?

213
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,811
- [Scotty] Well, you know,
you're, you're there,

214
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,915
and pretty soon, one
person's touching.

215
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,187
Things just automatically
kind of happened.

216
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,123
- You look at how he
stumbled into this,

217
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,290
and literally, he did stumble.

218
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,859
But then, the key fact there is

219
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,429
that there was a whole
network of folks,

220
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:35,000
certainly the set
designers, the hairdressers.

221
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,771
They were waiting for someone
like Scotty to come along.

222
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,707
- [Scotty] Edwin B. Willis,

223
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,943
the number-one set
decorator at MGM.

224
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,745
Every picture that came
out of MGM, it said,

225
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,948
&quot;Set Decoration by
Edwin B. Willis.&quot;

226
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,016
All of a sudden, Edwin called me

227
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,218
and says so-and-so is coming
to the station, so-and-so,

228
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,853
and this happened
in a matter of days.

229
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:58,089
And then, word of mouth,
everything flows automatically.

230
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,292
You couldn't believe
how busy I was.

231
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,730
I needed help.

232
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:07,332
(lively upbeat jazz music)

233
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,467
There's a place on Sunset

234
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,135
called The Crossroads
of the World.

235
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,904
And there were women,
voluntarily worked down there

236
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,305
that would take messages.

237
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,141
I left a number there and
the guys picked it up,

238
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,110
and pretty soon, I
had about 20 guys

239
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,045
hanging around the gas
station, very soon.

240
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,146
And these were guys who just got

241
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,150
out of the Marine Corps
too, and didn't have a dime.

242
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,487
Somebody I knew would come in
to the gas station and say,

243
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,257
&quot;Jeez, I'd love to take that
nice-looking guy to dinner.&quot;

244
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,293
I'd say, &quot;For 20 bucks,
you can suck his cock now

245
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,328
&quot;and forget the goddamn dinner.&quot;

246
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,497
You know, everything
was $20 bucks.

247
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,964
I would say to my friends,

248
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,166
&quot;I'm gonna fix you
up with a trick,

249
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,335
&quot;and all the guy's gonna do
is take and suck your cock,

250
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,906
&quot;and it's the same as if your
girl was sucking your cock.

251
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,141
&quot;If you wanna close your eyes

252
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,742
&quot;and think it's her
sucking your cock, do.&quot;

253
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,310
&quot;Okay, I'll do it once.&quot;

254
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,346
Well, once, twice,
you know. (laughs)

255
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,483
♪ When the world should
all be sleepin' ♪

256
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,218
♪ And the melody
comes creepin' ♪

257
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,988
- [Scotty] I was fixing every
bit of 20 people a night

258
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:05,091
up at the gas station,
seven nights a week.

259
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,328
Behind the gas station I
had this huge house trailer.

260
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,829
Now the guy that left it

261
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,296
gave me $50 a month
to park it there.

262
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,800
And he said, &quot;Use it
any time you want.&quot;

263
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,235
♪ It's no cabaret ♪

264
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,237
- [Scotty] And you
entered from the center.

265
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,805
Up here was a king-size bed

266
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,073
and over here was
a king-size bed

267
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:24,143
and they had a drape
that could separate it.

268
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,345
Son of a bitch, I had that
going night and day, you know.

269
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,881
(upbeat jazz music)

270
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,348
And then a friend of
mine, an old queen,

271
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,184
ran a motel right
across the street.

272
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,154
He would call me and say,

273
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,223
&quot;I have six, seven,
eight, 12, and 14 vacant.

274
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,057
&quot;The door's open.

275
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,292
&quot;Just go right in.

276
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,361
&quot;Five bucks, do you
get what I mean?&quot;

277
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,464
(upbeat jazz music)

278
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:47,498
A lot of people liked
the bathroom thing.

279
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,334
It had a little hole,
a quarter-inch hole,

280
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,404
and I had that directly
underneath the toilet paper.

281
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,139
You would lay on
the air compressor,

282
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:56,342
put your eye up against the
thing, and watch the washroom.

283
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,078
So I had people in there,
and I had people watching

284
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:01,380
and the whole bit,
you get what I mean?

285
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,283
That's what you call
business, baby. (laughs)

286
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,319
(upbeat jazz music)

287
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,027
(men laughing)

288
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,930
Good to see ya.

289
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,098
You sweet little baby, you.

290
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,165
- Oh, I've been trying to
get you over here for years.

291
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,367
- [Scotty] You've been so nice.

292
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,536
- I told Scotty he was so
well-organized in those days.

293
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,875
I said if you'd been in the
business world instead of here,

294
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:32,511
you would've ended up as
chairman of General Motors.

295
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:35,548
- (laughs) You sweetheart, Jack.

296
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,450
Jack was a young trick of mine.

297
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,385
- You picked me up in Acapulco.

298
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:41,520
- That, that's right.

299
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:42,921
We met in Acapulco.
- Acapulco.

300
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,857
- Son of a bitch,
that's right. (laughs)

301
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,324
- [Jack] Where did
those years go?

302
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,258
- [Scotty] Jesus, I don't know.

303
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,495
Those years slipped
by, Jack, so quick.

304
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,898
- This, this was a
book you had to write.

305
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,633
But everyone trusted you.

306
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,336
Did, did anyone ever bother
saying to you, you know,

307
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,504
&quot;You would never
betray me, would you?&quot;

308
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:00,405
I mean--

309
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,908
- That's why, when
everyone was living,

310
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:05,377
I would never even think,
under any circumstances,

311
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,579
no god-damned dime, and no
matter what anyone offered me,

312
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:09,581
I wouldn't write a book then.

313
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:14,620
(people chattering)
(cameras clicking)

314
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,028
- All those people.
- Ya.

315
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,430
- Don't you think you
misled their trust

316
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,199
by writing a tell-all book?

317
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,401
- A lot of people at
the time knew what,

318
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:33,005
who these people were
and what they were,

319
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,907
so it's not a secret, really.

320
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,543
It may be a secret to some
square that lives in Illinois,

321
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:42,281
but people who lived
in Hollywood, they
knew these people.

322
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,082
- Yeah, but you,
but for their fans,

323
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,283
I mean, like if they
had a grand kid,

324
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,353
the grand kid remembers, &quot;Oh
no, my grandfather was gay,&quot;

325
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,454
or whatever like that.

326
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,423
- What's wrong with, what's
wrong with being gay?

327
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,258
So, but thanks anyhow.

328
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,393
- [Man] Okay, that's
just my feedback.

329
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,295
- No, I can, I can see it.

330
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,129
Thank you.

331
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,197
Thank you.

332
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,299
I did the book just to
show some of these people

333
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,501
that people are still people.

334
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,603
But some of these
squares think oh my God,

335
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:07,372
you're weird, you're
different, you know.

336
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,573
Like, ladies would say to me,

337
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:09,508
&quot;Just what are you?&quot;

338
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,676
I said, &quot;I'm everything.&quot;

339
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,411
(man laughs)

340
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,444
- [Woman] Thank you.

341
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,581
- [Photographer]
One more, one more.

342
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:17,416
There we go.

343
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,617
(men laughing)

344
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,953
- Just Hollywood trash, Scotty.

345
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,121
You and I traveled
on the same highways

346
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:25,257
and low life, and the alleyways.

347
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,358
- [Scotty] That's right.

348
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,660
- You know I worked for
George Cukor for two years.

349
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,964
And, and Katharine Hepburn
lived down in the guesthouse.

350
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,132
You know, she would come
up, &quot;George, George!

351
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:39,004
&quot;I hope you're not up there
spilling the beans about us,

352
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:41,606
&quot;telling, telling the truth!

353
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,543
&quot;We've been in the
closet for 40 years,

354
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,345
&quot;and don't, don't
you,&quot; and, you know,

355
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,679
finally we had to
cancel the book,

356
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,314
and he, George hated it.

357
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:52,384
George had to give
back a $75,000 advance.

358
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,652
That nearly killed him.

359
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,521
- [Narrator] George
Cukor has been the center

360
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:58,523
of more controversies
than any other director

361
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:00,392
in the history of Hollywood.

362
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:01,993
He's not only directed a string

363
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,629
of highly successful
pictures like Little Women,

364
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:07,099
Philadelphia Story,
and Adam's Rib,

365
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,434
but he's also been
fired from quite a few,

366
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,970
including Gone with the Wind.

367
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,305
(slow soft bass music)

368
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,707
- [Scotty] I met George in 1947.

369
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,144
George came in the gas station
in his new black Dodge Sedan,

370
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:21,647
introduced himself, and
invited me up to the house.

371
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,616
Within a few days I was up here.

372
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,651
He almost came on
like Walter Pidgeon.

373
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:29,254
&quot;It's a hot day. I'd
love to have you come up,

374
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:32,291
&quot;take a dip in my pool, and
cool off,&quot; and things like that.

375
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,494
- [Narrator] George
Cukor has never married,

376
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,463
but lives alone in a palatial
home in Beverly Hills,

377
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:41,632
a house which has seven living
rooms and only one bedroom.

378
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,238
- George Cukor was,
really one of the arbiters

379
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,506
of Hollywood society.

380
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,208
He was someone who had
the greatest parties,

381
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,810
he, he knew everyone.

382
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:55,447
(soft orchestral music)

383
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,518
- On Saturday nights,
there were like the great,

384
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,721
elegant soirees with the
kings and queens of Hollywood:

385
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,724
Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier,

386
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,127
Garbo.

387
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,464
Sunday afternoons around
the pool was brunch

388
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:17,669
with 10, 12, 15 of the most
beautiful men in Hollywood.

389
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,408
Scotty Bowers would
always provide new talent.

390
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,581
- George Cukor was the
epicenter for gay Hollywood

391
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,583
in the '30s, '40s, and '50s.

392
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,719
If George gave his seal
of approval to someone,

393
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:37,489
the rest of the community
looked on with favor.

394
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,724
George respected Scotty.

395
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:43,662
He wasn't simply this Madam
Cukor called for events,

396
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,098
he was also a friend
of George Cukor's,

397
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,235
and Scotty became friends
with many of Cukor's friends.

398
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:53,205
(soft piano music)

399
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,376
(birds chirping)

400
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:09,688
- [Scotty] That son of a bitch

401
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,456
is loaded with
stuff in there, wow!

402
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,658
(laughs)

403
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:16,228
- [Matt] How many garages
like this do you have?

404
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:19,630
- Let's see, I have one,

405
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,133
two,

406
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,435
three, four, about five

407
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,270
full.

408
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:29,841
I started this, Jesus,
25 years ago, I guess.

409
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,276
And I kept packing
in, packing in

410
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,445
until you couldn't
even move anything.

411
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,316
(birds chirping)

412
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,354
The pictures should be in here.

413
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,201
These were all the guys
from the gas station.

414
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:59,236
All clean-cut, nice-looking
guys, aren't they?

415
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,873
- [Matt] When was the last
time you saw those photos?

416
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,578
- Uh, about the time
they were taken. (laughs)

417
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:07,746
But I haven't seen
them since then.

418
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,848
I forgot about them completely.

419
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,650
Every one of these guys,
including the girl,

420
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,719
were all hustlers, every
one of them. (laughs)

421
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:18,389
(steady jazz music)

422
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,793
Ronnie Stinson was my buddy
from Regina, Saskatchewan.

423
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:24,163
One of my number one
guys, Ronnie was.

424
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,934
Bob Atkinson had a big prick,
and Bob was out of the Navy.

425
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,537
He had a nice rugged look about
him, looked like a cowboy,

426
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,605
you know, that type of thing.

427
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:37,742
Georgie Fargo from Chicago,
put him on a few tricks,

428
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:38,677
he wasn't great.

429
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,245
His heart wasn't in it.

430
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,780
One day, I introduced
him to Clint Eastwood,

431
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,615
and he and Clint
were buddy-buddy,

432
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:46,784
and, and Clint got him
a part in pictures.

433
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,589
And Lee was a pretty,
little, 21-year-old boy

434
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,859
that every fucking queen in
Hollywood was hot for. (laughs)

435
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,695
- [Matt] Are any of
these guys still alive?

436
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,496
- Some of them are still living.

437
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,433
Lee, Lee's old, but
he's still around.

438
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,671
(Scotty laughs)

439
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:07,839
Hello, baby.

440
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,544
When I think of Lee, I can
only think of nice things,

441
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,512
and a smile comes on my face,

442
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:17,249
because here we
are back together.

443
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,650
It was a cool little car,
that little '55 way back.

444
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,786
- [Matt] Some people
don't believe the book.

445
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,021
What do you say to those people?

446
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,790
- I showed it to
a friend of mine.

447
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:27,426
He thought it was trash.

448
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,729
I said, &quot;Well, it's,
maybe, that's your opinion,

449
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,930
&quot;but it's all true.&quot;

450
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,868
- [Matt] About what year did
Lee show up at the gas station?

451
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:38,937
- 1951.

452
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,041
I came into Hollywood.

453
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:46,378
I saw this sign on a
glass window and it said,

454
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,612
&quot;Are you looking for employ?&quot;

455
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,414
I said yes, so he
hired me right there.

456
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:50,681
- [Scotty] Right then and there.

457
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,449
The moment he walked
in, he was on his,

458
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,686
he was on his first
trick, right, within a,

459
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,022
within an hour. (laughs)

460
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,691
- Customers please, Scott.

461
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,896
- I must have given you this
card 60 years ago, right?

462
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:08,833
These are basically business
people out of New York.

463
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:11,069
Don't forget, I was fixing
an awful lot of people up

464
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,904
that weren't famous, too.

465
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:13,905
This is just a backup.

466
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,473
So when you go to New York,

467
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:16,674
in case something happens
with the deal you got,

468
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:19,377
you got somethin' to fall back
on for a ticket back home,

469
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,011
you know?

470
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:20,945
What the hell.

471
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,614
- Well, this is a program

472
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,451
from a Shakespeare's
Memorial Theater.

473
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:27,585
Charlie autographed it for me.

474
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,888
He said, &quot;Lee, to Lee, who
bawled the hell out of me

475
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,790
&quot;until I did this.

476
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,858
&quot;Gratefully, Charles Laughton.&quot;

477
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:34,893
That's Charlie here,

478
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,861
King Lear.

479
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,864
- Lee was Charles
Laughton's favorite,

480
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:42,667
and Charles loved
Lee, really he did.

481
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,736
- [Lee] Charlie, he
was a beautiful man.

482
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:45,670
He really was.

483
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:46,838
- [Woman] Hello, Charles.

484
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:47,872
How are you?
- Hello, gentlemen.

485
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,341
- How do you do?
- Hello, Elsie.

486
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,875
- [Lee] And whenever he
had problems with Elsie,

487
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,511
he'd call me up and we'd
go have dinner some place.

488
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:54,946
- Hello, come on in.
- Come on.

489
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,948
- [Lee] I was a good listener.

490
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,884
- [Matt] What did Charles
like to do sexually?

491
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,954
- He just likes to
suck cock. (laughs)

492
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:03,822
- That's right.

493
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,858
(lively jazz music)

494
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,763
Charles Laughton and I
were very close from,

495
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:14,066
way back from World War
II and up until he died.

496
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,004
I saw him myself and
fixed him up with tricks.

497
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,109
Charles was going to England,
I drove him to the airport.

498
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,877
And Charles, he
gave me an envelope

499
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,812
and I looked at it later,
it was a thousand dollars.

500
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,716
It's ten $100 bills
that he gave to me.

501
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,918
That's just being,
being nice, you know.

502
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,888
I certainly didn't
ever ask for it.

503
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:40,125
(lively upbeat jazz music)

504
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,894
The world was different
then than it is now.

505
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,902
(birds chirping)

506
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,047
You know, every
four or five days

507
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,850
you gotta run this up, you know.

508
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:08,086
(clock winding)

509
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,889
This is a little house
that I paid $22,000 for,

510
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,192
about 52 years ago.

511
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:17,795
$22,000 for the
house in $20 bills.

512
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:22,567
You know, those $20
add up quick. (laughs)

513
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,638
There are some pretty things
in here, you know, but...

514
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:29,841
Underneath it all, I meant.

515
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,811
I lived here with Bette

516
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,581
for just a dash over
50 years, I guess.

517
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,483
Bette was my first wife.

518
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:40,452
You might say that
we were common-law.

519
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,454
We never really married.

520
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,191
And, and as many years
as I've been here,

521
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,694
I rarely ever stayed
here, considering my work.

522
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,997
There were some years
I might be here one

523
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,933
and two nights in a year.

524
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,772
There are some nice
little goodies in here.

525
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:03,208
These are, these things in
the house are called goodies.

526
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,780
Bette had it very
nice, really, she did.

527
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:09,814
It's me that fucked it up.

528
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,086
And then that's Donna
when she was a little girl

529
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,822
that a friend of mine painted.

530
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,093
I'm rarely here.

531
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,028
I come up, get the mail,
get some phone calls and,

532
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,997
and other than that, I
don't even come here.

533
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:28,566
- [Answering
Machine] Message two.

534
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,635
- [Gerard] Hey, Scotty,
it's Gerard from Book Soup.

535
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,035
We were wondering
if you could come in

536
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,739
and sign some books for
us when you get a chance.

537
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:36,608
Thanks.

538
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,713
(birds chirping)

539
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,582
- [Man] West Hollywood
Book Fair this weekend,

540
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:47,986
so we wanted to take
some signed stock back.

541
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,156
(woman chattering)

542
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,598
- Boy, they have a book
on everything here.

543
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:02,199
Randolph Scott, Cary Grant.

544
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:03,935
What was so funny is they,

545
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:06,204
they lived right behind
the Chateau Marmont there.

546
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:08,939
And they lived at the beach too,

547
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,576
they lived right at
Santa Monica Beach.

548
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:12,677
And they lived
together, of course,

549
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,778
people said they were roommates.

550
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:14,946
Okay, we're roommates.

551
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:18,182
I mean lot of people who are
lovers are roommates too.

552
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:20,252
- Well, I feel it's
about time for a dip.

553
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,091
(lighthearted orchestral music)

554
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:30,161
- Young man, is that
Johnny Weissmuller?

555
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:32,062
- No, I wish it were.

556
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,633
(drum roll)

557
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:42,173
(lighthearted orchestral music)

558
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:43,608
- [Scotty] Back in those days,

559
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,677
people knew they were
lovers and together.

560
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,045
Then, all of a sudden,
as years go by,

561
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,279
they're kinda, &quot;How
dare you talk that way?&quot;

562
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,014
But I'm not talking about them,

563
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:52,183
I'm just saying they're great
guys, you know, both of them.

564
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:56,721
(moves into soft piano music)

565
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:59,122
I'd been with them
individually and both of them,

566
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,591
what you call a three-way,

567
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,094
and I've also
brought another buddy

568
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:04,995
for them to where
there were four of us,

569
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:06,064
you know, two-and-two.

570
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:10,168
(soft jazz music)

571
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,770
Before he became an
actor, a known actor,

572
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:15,340
Cary Grant was living with
Orry Kelly in New York,

573
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,641
who was a mad queen.

574
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:20,244
Orry Kelly was a dress designer.

575
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:22,814
Actually, he got three
Oscars for dress design.

576
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,184
- Some Like It Hot.

577
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,185
Orry Kelly!

578
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,987
- [Scotty] Then he came
out here and lived here

579
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,822
for a year and a half together.

580
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,124
Then he met Randolph
Scott and left Orry,

581
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,859
dropped him like a hot potato,

582
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:37,195
because he wanted to steer clear

583
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,997
for fear they might
think he's gay,

584
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,166
if he's with someone
who's known to be gay.

585
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:47,272
(upbeat jazz orchestral music)

586
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:52,010
- When Hollywood began,

587
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,112
when the studio system
really got, got rolling,

588
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,281
Hollywood was a
rollicking place,

589
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,384
there were very, very few rules.

590
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:05,223
It was a haven for people
who lived larger than life,

591
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,660
had radical views
about sex or politics.

592
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,162
And there were, you know,
lot of same-sex cohabitation,

593
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:13,063
people, men and
women living together

594
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:14,365
who weren't getting married.

595
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:17,834
The kind of rules that,
and, and strict moral code

596
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:18,969
that we associate with Hollywood

597
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:21,839
came in place in the 1930s
with the production code.

598
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:26,344
- It's vulgar, it's cheap
and the tawdry is out!

599
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:30,181
There is no room on
the screen at any time

600
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:33,118
for pictures which offend
against common decency,

601
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,954
and these, the industry
will not allow.

602
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,791
- With the production code
came morals clauses in,

603
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,192
in people's contracts.

604
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,961
(soft piano music)

605
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,263
Hollywood had adopted

606
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,733
a very different
relationship with the public.

607
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:51,169
It was really about, we're
just like all of you.

608
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:57,274
It was very important to
sell this myth to America,

609
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,310
that the movie stars
were just good,

610
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,780
honest, moral,
law-abiding citizens.

611
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,183
- If it became public
that you were gay,

612
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,218
you would be immediately fired.

613
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,187
- When actors were under
contract to their studios,

614
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,923
everything about their
life was defined:

615
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,125
how, what they wore, how
they wore their hair,

616
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:16,060
you know, and they worked,
very, very, very hard.

617
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:18,129
They made lots of movies a year.

618
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:19,430
Where could they get a real life

619
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:22,266
where they could just let
go and sort of undo the,

620
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,802
the belt, as it were,
and the, the constraints?

621
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:26,204
Scotty gave them that.

622
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,741
- Scotty was able to
provide a very real service

623
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,842
to these people, who
otherwise were very restricted

624
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,110
by this moral code.

625
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:37,248
(slow dramatic music)

626
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:40,118
(traffic humming)

627
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,259
- Now, this is a fucking
low-flush toilet.

628
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,961
This is not a good
toilet at all.

629
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:53,264
That's a low-flush.

630
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:54,933
Let's see.

631
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:01,506
Not a bad-looking
toilet, but that,

632
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,508
that's just a recent type.

633
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,976
I would take it otherwise,

634
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,311
but it's not that
good of a toilet.

635
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,254
- [Matt] Where did
this hole come from?

636
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,489
- Huh?

637
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:20,258
- [Matt] This hole.

638
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,327
- Oh, she had a rug on here,

639
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,397
and the rug dry-rotted the wood.

640
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,267
- I fell in, and it went
down up to here in this leg,

641
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,501
and I couldn't get it out.

642
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,869
- [Scotty] You can
see that circle.

643
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:32,804
See the circle?

644
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,971
She had put a big carpet down.

645
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:37,308
When you a carpet down,
it dry-rots below.

646
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:38,575
- Anyway, I had to
call the neighbors

647
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,945
to come and get me out.

648
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:43,248
- [Scotty] So I gotta
replace all of that stuff.

649
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,418
- [TV Reporter] Police got a
call that two hand grenades

650
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,387
have been found in a fire pit

651
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,456
in the backyard of this house.

652
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,526
- He's just collecting things.

653
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,029
He never did this before.

654
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,362
Never.

655
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,166
So it's just since
we've been here.

656
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:07,104
- I have every copy
of Playboy Magazine

657
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,106
since Playboy came out.

658
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,408
- [Matt] Where are they?

659
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,377
- Over at the other house,
stacked in the basement.

660
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,545
- [Lois] There's no room here.

661
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:15,947
- Well, you know,
you know how much,

662
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,882
I got stacks this high
for Christ's sake.

663
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,886
- [Matt] Tell me about
these photos on the wall.

664
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,322
Lois, are they your family?

665
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,059
- [Lois] That's my mother and
my brother and I up there.

666
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,160
That's me.

667
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:32,330
A long, long time ago. (laughs)

668
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,899
- [Scotty] We've been
together about 35 years.

669
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:36,934
And that was Cindy.

670
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,536
The god-dammed time goes.

671
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:42,406
- [Lois] We met in
December of '80,

672
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,542
we were married July '84.

on Robinson called Alberto's
and I met her in there.

676
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,058

00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:26,283
He came past me one night and
said, &quot;I love your singing.&quot;

686
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:31,355
I don't know, he looked
like a, an old leprechaun.

687
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:34,225
I mean, it was the dickens
in his eyes, you know.

688
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,459
(laughs) I don't know.

689
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,561
♪ Wonderful you ♪

690
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:41,065
♪ It had to be you ♪

691
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:44,168
♪ It had to be you ♪

692
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:47,272
(audience clapping)

693
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:56,647
- [Matt] Is that the paperback?

694
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,382
- Yeah, it is.

695
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:00,551
For a paperback it's
kinda nice, you know.

696
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:01,652
- Honey?
- What?

697
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:03,287
- Didn't you get a
box of these home?

698
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,623
- [Scotty] He took
eight books out of here.

699
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,524
Another good title
would've been,

700
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,694
How To Make People Happy.
- Mm hm.

701
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,996
- Same thing as the,
the real book, yeah.

702
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,466
- [Matt] Lois, do you
think you'll be tempted

703
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:16,600
to read one of them?

704
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:17,468
- No, she won't.

705
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,237
She won't read those
goddamn things.

706
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,472
Are you kidding?

707
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,743
If she read the book,
she'd jump off the balcony.

708
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,278
She'd jump out the window.

709
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:32,016
- [Matt] You're not planning
on reading it, why not?

710
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,216
- Well, two reasons.

711
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,619
I don't, I didn't know him then.

712
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:37,722
I don't know him as that person.

713
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,157
And not sure I want to.

714
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,258
(Scotty laughs)

715
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,659
And I'm not interested
in Hollywood

716
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,596
shenanigans.

717
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,130
I'm just not.

718
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,067
I guess I feel some,

719
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:54,405
I don't know how you'd put it,

720
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:56,407
regret.
- Regret?

721
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,175
- That he didn't say something.

722
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,577
- [Scotty] What do you
mean, say something?

723
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,014
- Before, when I first knew you,

724
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,283
about your life prior
to my meeting you.

725
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:07,718
- [Scotty] You never
told me about your life

726
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:08,585
prior to me meeting you.

727
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,053
I never asked.
- Ain't nothing to tell.

728
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:11,055
- [Scotty] Well, you never know.

729
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:12,490
I mean you could've been
a hooker, I don't know.

730
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,557
- You know what
I'm talking about.

731
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,658
Stop being silly.

732
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:15,459
- [Scotty] You could've
been a hooker and something.

733
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:17,228
I never asked you,
you know that.

734
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,495
I'm not that type--

735
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,031
- Well, apparently, it
didn't matter to you.

736
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,699
It might have mattered to me.

737
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,538
(birds chirping)

738
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:32,610
(slow soft music)

739
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,246
- Yeah, you know, the
god-dammed toilet.

740
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,447
I didn't get it right away.

741
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,350
I got so much yesterday,
yesterday afternoon.

742
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,284
And, and...

743
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,590
You never know when you're
gonna need it, baby. (laughs)

744
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:50,628
I used to take care
of Beach's houses.

745
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,098
Beach Dickerson owned about
18 or 19 houses up here.

746
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,266
And I maintained them.

747
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,367
I did all the plumbing
in all of them.

748
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,702
I mean, see, see Beach
could count on me to do it,

749
00:33:58,735 --> 00:34:00,271
and do it right.

750
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:03,707
Originally, Beach met
me at the gas station,

751
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,343
then we became friends.

752
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,313
This was his house and he
lived here all those years.

753
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:16,654
Beach was originally
from Glennville, Georgia,

754
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:19,656
went in the Army,
ended up in California,

755
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,625
and stayed here,
and became kind of

756
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:23,393
what you call a
half-assed actor.

757
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,096
I still get checks.

758
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,732
$1.80, $2.25 for little
things he was in.

759
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,266
You know what I mean?

760
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,404
- [Announcer] The Creature
From the Haunted Sea!

761
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:37,741
(dramatic theatrical music)

762
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:39,710
- [Scotty] Oh, they
were class C movies

763
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:41,645
by Roger Corman many years ago:

764
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:43,446
The Attack of the Crab Monster

765
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,583
and Creatures of
the Haunted Sea.

766
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:49,120
(soft orchestral music)

767
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:54,125
Beach was my steady number-one
person that I would see.

768
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,696
Oh, that's Lois's, the
Columbia University,

769
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,531
City of New York, Lois Broad.

770
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,335
(soft orchestral music)

771
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,171
Beach owned about eight,
eight thoroughbred horses.

772
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,140
And the only horse
he ever had that won,

773
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,476
he named the horse
Hollywood Scott.

774
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:15,313
And that was the only horse
he ever had that won a race.

775
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,683
- Beach Dickerson owned a house
up where I'd walk my dogs.

776
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,386
I said, &quot;I understand, you know,

777
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:24,654
&quot;we have a mutual
friend, Scotty Bower.&quot;

778
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:25,789
He said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;

779
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,791
He said, &quot;Scotty's my lover.&quot;

780
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,493
I said, &quot;Well,
that's news to me.

781
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:33,397
&quot;I didn't know Scotty had
a, a gay lover up here.&quot;

782
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,332
And he said, &quot;Oh,
yeah.&quot; (laughs)

783
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:39,436
- [Scotty] Here's
Jennifer Aniston.

784
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,172
Here's Beach.

785
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,806
Every one of these
girls are actresses,

786
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,241
and they all lived here.

787
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,844
And this was taken out
on the patio there.

788
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:49,712
Elvis Presley and
a girl they were,

789
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:51,549
when he worked on
a show with Elvis.

790
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,653
There's Beach and
Corbin Bernsen.

791
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,688
- [Jack] He was Beach's godson.

792
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,924
He was on LA Law
and a few things.

793
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,328
- Beach left me two annuities,

794
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:06,830
plus $300,000, plus two houses,

795
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:08,432
which was quite nice.

796
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,603
He left me this
house, another house

797
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:15,706
around the corner
down there to sell.

798
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,309
And the house that he left me,

799
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,378
I sold for a little
bit over $600,000.

800
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:24,881
The will was made out that I
have this house until I die.

801
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:28,285
Then when I die, and I,
I've gotta be really dead,

802
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:31,455
then, and may not happen,
then fuckin' Corbin gets it.

803
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,524
See? (laughs)

804
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,393
Corbin, when Beach died,

805
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:37,694
Corbin was gonna rent a yacht

806
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,531
and spread the ashes at
sea and have a big party.

807
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:43,433
He wanted something like
$35,000 from the estate,

808
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,768
and I said,

809
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:45,903
don't give him a fucking dime.

810
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:46,770
That's all bullshit.

811
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:47,837
You know what I mean?

812
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:51,408
Right now, Beach's
ashes are down in,

813
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,276
in Pat's garage in
the trunk of his car

814
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,247
where they've been for
the last five years.

815
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,881
We were always gonna
do something with them,

816
00:36:57,914 --> 00:36:58,815
I don't know what.

817
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,986
And then, then Pat
died and they're still

818
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,687
in the trunk of
the car down there.

819
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:08,425
(crickets chirping)

820
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,261
Hello kitty.

821
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,763
Did you know cats
hate scented litter?

822
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:16,799
Look.

823
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,469
There, look at
those, those eyes.

824
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,538
You gotta say they're
cute little things.

825
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,643
David called and said
they've got a check

826
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,881
from the publishing
company for $188,000.

827
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,750
That guy from the office said,

828
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,451
&quot;Is it okay to
send to the house?&quot;

829
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:35,919
I said yes, so
they'll send it here.

830
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,855
- I just wonder how they do it.

831
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,523
Do they have an accounting?

832
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:41,325
Do we know how many
books were sold?

833
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,795
Do we know what are
his percentages?

834
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,397
Nothing.

835
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,365
- Well, whatever you
get helps, you know.

836
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:49,733
I mean, what the hell.

837
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:51,802
- No, I'd just like to
know how many books,

838
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,905
and how much do you get,
and how much do you get,

839
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,807
and how much did
David get and...

840
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,676
- [Matt] That seems
like your policy.

841
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,310
The money takes care of itself.

842
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,412
- That's right.

843
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,447
Do you know there are a
couple of old Jewish ladies

844
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,015
in Beverly Hills who have money,

845
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:09,787
that years ago I worked, I
worked for them for $5 an hour.

846
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,955
I go to work from them
now, they have money.

847
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,692
They hand me $20. I'm
there five or six hours.

848
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,026
I give them a kiss
and say thank you,

849
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,828
like everything is okay, right?

850
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:19,897
Perfectly all right.

851
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,665
- But they're laughing
at you. (laughs)

852
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:23,067
- Everything works out.

853
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,535
Things always work out.

854
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,003
They, they, you know...

855
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,941
(jazzy piano music)

856
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:46,023
- [Man] So Scotty, we are all
big fans of your services.

857
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:48,626
- There's Polish,
French, and Spanish now.

858
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,028
- We can get a German. (laughs)

859
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:51,829
- Well, they're going,

860
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:52,796
they're going to
German and Italian

861
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,598
in about two or three months.
- Oh, yeah?

862
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:55,999
- Ya.
- How cool.

863
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:58,836
- You know somebody
emailed me just a week ago,

864
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,437
and was asking, you know,

865
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,904
&quot;Have you guys thought
of doing something

866
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,041
&quot;with that guy Scotty Bowers?&quot;

867
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:06,009
and, &quot;He's so cute.&quot;

868
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,944
Did you pose for Bob Mizer?

869
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,080
- No, but I had many
guys pose for Bob Mizer.

870
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:15,018
Bob Mizer was kind of the
number one queen of guys.

871
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:16,720
(upbeat jazz music)

872
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,022
You know, Bob Mizer was
the number one photographer

873
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:20,057
of boys at the time.

874
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:24,862
(upbeat jazz music)

875
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,463
- [Dian] The
stories about Ewell.

876
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:27,765
Did you know Tom Ewell?

877
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,866
- [Scotty] Oh yeah,
I knew Tom very well.

878
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,035
But Tom was a mad one.

879
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,437
- [Dian] That's what we heard.

880
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,040
He was in The Seven Year Itch.

881
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,543
He was an everyman.

882
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:40,544
- Tom Ewell,

883
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:41,745
a lot of people didn't
even know he was gay.

884
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,013
But Tom, he could see 20 guys,

885
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:45,415
one right after the
other, and want more.

886
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,987
So, I called them
big users. (laughs)

887
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,391
The three, what you call big
users, three of them were:

888
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:55,426
Tom Ewell

889
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,629
and Ramon Novarro

890
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,997
and Cole Porter.

891
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,901
Cole Porter would say,
&quot;Can you bring 15 guys by?

892
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,070
&quot;I wanna suck 15 guys off,
one right after the other.&quot;

893
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:09,873
♪ You're the top ♪

894
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,676
♪ You're Mahatma Gandhi ♪

895
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:15,044
♪ You're the top ♪

896
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:18,148
♪ You're napoleon brandy ♪

897
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,485
(moves into bluesy jazz music)

898
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:24,655
- Normally, I would not
talk about it really,

899
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,157
but people have often said,

900
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,127
you couldn't have done
that many things in,

901
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,962
in any given week, fixing
up that many people,

902
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:34,198
seeing that many people,

903
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,566
doing this working
at the gas station.

904
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,134
You're fucking right, I did it.

905
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:40,537
I fucked Bette Davis in World
War II when she was married

906
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,473
to a guy I used to
fix up with tricks.

907
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,074
And we used to have
three-way deals.

908
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:47,711
I went to bed with
J. Edgar Hoover.

909
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:48,912
He was in drag.

910
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,215
He was not a great
beauty either, you know,

911
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,818
but I was treating him
just like he's a girl.

912
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:57,587
Judith Anderson was a
friend of Alex Tear.

913
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,090
Alex had said, &quot;I'm sending
Scotty over with a gift.&quot;

914
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,024
&quot;Where's the gift?&quot;

915
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:01,859
I'm the gift.

916
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,259
You get what I mean?

917
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:04,928
We finally go to bed together.

918
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,863
But she was more
into girls than guys,

919
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,899
because later I fixed
her up with girls.

920
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,502
One day Cary Grant
was in the gas station

921
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,705
and Rock Hudson just
happened to be there.

922
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,073
Cary Grant picked him out,

923
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,642
so I fixed him up
with Rock for $20.

924
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:20,110
And Rock saw him several times.

925
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:22,046
This is before
Rock had any money.

926
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,215
And Laurence Olivier
and Vivien Leigh,

927
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,251
I never tricked them together.

928
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,952
I would fix them up with guys,

929
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:32,055
and then I would see her
at George Cukor's house.

930
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,591
She would come and
quietly open the gate,

931
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:36,627
and all the way in it was,
&quot;Shh, don't say a word.&quot;

932
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,761
10 minutes later in the
bedroom as I'm fucking her,

933
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:40,264
she's screaming.

934
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,131
- Whoo!

935
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,133
- And Bill Holden,

936
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,003
I fixed him up with an
awful lot of girls too.

937
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,171
When they did Sunset
Boulevard right here

938
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:51,008
with Gloria Swanson
and Bill Holden.

939
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,044
And Bill called me and
said, come on over.

940
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:55,212
- Goodbye, Norma.

941
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:56,813
- [Scotty] They did night
scenes at the swimming pool,

942
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:58,582
behind the big house
that was there.

943
00:41:58,615 --> 00:41:59,817
- [Gloria] Joe!

944
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,053
- I went over and fucked
around all night long

945
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,754
while they were shooting
one little scene

946
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,089
that could've taken
three minutes to shoot.

947
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:08,125
And I said, &quot;Bill,
forget that bullshit.&quot;

948
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,594
(gun fires)

949
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,898
Hi Tony.
- Hello.

950
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,767
- [Scotty] How are you, baby?

951
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,736
- And we still, he
still comes to the house

952
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:21,104
and works for me.
- That's right.

953
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,339
I still come and work here.

954
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:23,941
- [Tony] But Scotty, you
can show them around.

955
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,276
You know the house.

956
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:30,279
- See how many Emmys
Tony has right here?

957
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,148
Right there.

958
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:34,217
(birds chirping)

959
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,053
There are some gorgeous
paintings here.

960
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:40,723
Oh, (laughs) that's
a thing he did of me.

961
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,092
(laughs)

962
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,728
- Since he serviced
a lot of people,

963
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:48,098
and we were having a party
on the Fourth of July,

964
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:51,734
and so, I had to have
an American flag.

965
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:56,774
And, of course, he did all of
his work with the telephone,

966
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,109
and most of it in a bedroom.

967
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:01,778
- I mean very clever, Tony,

968
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:03,246
the way he thought
when he did it.

969
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:07,117
- This is from a
Fourth of July event.

970
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,086
That's Joe Kennedy from Paris,

971
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,190
and he was Big Dick
Strauss, Richard Strauss.

972
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,359
- [Scotty] Oh, yeah.
I remember him.

973
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,227
- [Tony] We would
have a parade in drag.

974
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:21,365
(bluesy jazz music)

975
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,743
- [Scotty] Tony had
all kind of parties.

976
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,715
You know me, I'm up
for anything. (laughs)

977
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:42,185
I'm in it for anything,
anytime, you know what I mean?

978
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:43,319
(laughs)

979
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:46,357
(bluesy jazz music)

980
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,065
Hi honey.
- Hi.

981
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:56,833
- I got your car all
covered and everything.

982
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:59,236
Did you find
Hollywood Sheet Music?

983
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,238
- No, I went to Chico's
instead. (laughs)

984
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,906
- [Scotty] Oh. (laughs)

985
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,142
- I'm going to a new
place to sing Sunday.

986
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,176
- [Matt] Oh, where?

987
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:07,310
What's it called?
- I don't know.

988
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:08,278
- It's a fucking gay bar.

989
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:10,814
- [Lois] It was beautiful.

990
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:12,315
It was like a nightclub,

991
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:14,183
and it felt very strange to be
there on a Sunday afternoon.

992
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:16,019
- Yeah, it's a purple
lights and everything and--

993
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:20,791
- But, it was filled
with gay guys,

994
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,726
and I don't know how to react.

995
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:24,361
I mean, you, you know, I
don't care what they do,

996
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:27,698
but I don't like to be in
the middle of it, you know.

997
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:32,302
- [Scotty] (laughs)
You didn't know.

998
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:40,277
- You know, I'm writing a book

999
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,846
about how gays are
treated in Hollywood.

1000
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,083
So, when I came across your
book, I mean I was just amazed.

1001
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,451
- [Scotty] That's a
perfect one to ask, right?

1002
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,285
- Exactly. (laughs)

1003
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,353
- [Scotty] You
know, you're right.

1004
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,721
- You're revealing a lot,
so that was the point.

1005
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,957
The fact that at that
time, studio were trying to

1006
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,860
secure what was happening
with their leads--

1007
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:58,762
- Remember, at that time,
many people who were gay

1008
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,864
had jobs, that they
would lose their jobs

1009
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,433
if they were exposed in any way.

1010
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:07,471
After World War II, the vice
squad was red-hot in this town.

1011
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,408
They were picking
up guys for nothing.

1012
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:20,718
- It wasn't fun, sitting in
a gay bar on Melrose in 1962

1013
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:22,953
waiting for the police to raid.

1014
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,221
They'd go in there
and they'd say,

1015
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,390
&quot;We have a quota of
eight for tonight.&quot;

1016
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:30,761
And you know, to be
beaten up in public parks,

1017
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,163
or have an effeminate friend

1018
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:35,499
viciously attacked
going down the street.

1019
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:40,537
- It's probably hard for people
who were born the last 20,

1020
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,540
30, perhaps even 40
years to fully grasp

1021
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:46,343
how difficult it was.

1022
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,078
Not only was it hard for them

1023
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:49,346
to find someone to fall in love,

1024
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,249
but if they tried,
they could go to jail,

1025
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,884
they could go to a institution

1026
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,819
where they might be
castrated or lobotomized.

1027
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:00,290
This was a terrible,
terrible time for people.

1028
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,259
- Crush the monster.

1029
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,961
Crush homosexuality.

1030
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:07,965
Homosexuality is, in
fact a mental illness,

1031
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:12,202
which has reached
epidemiological proportions.

1032
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:13,503
- When we hear
about these stories

1033
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:15,438
of people being
arrested in the parks,

1034
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:17,407
and we think, oh, they must
have been such degenerates

1035
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,309
to be down there
having sex in public.

1036
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,878
But in some cases, you
know, they were simply there

1037
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:24,581
to meet someone like themselves.

1038
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:28,351
Scotty was able to allow
these people to have lives

1039
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:30,287
that were honest and authentic,

1040
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,456
which is really what
they were seeking.

1041
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:37,294
- I think what Scotty
did was kind of

1042
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,462
an introduction service.

1043
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:43,200
People wanted something,
Scotty would get it for them.

1044
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:47,204
Being exploited may be
true of prostitution,

1045
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,538
but that wasn't what Scotty did.

1046
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:50,374
It wasn't prostitution.

1047
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:54,544
- Oh man!
- Hello, baby! (laughs)

1048
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:58,415
- This man helped buy this house

1049
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:02,185
in the darkest days of my life

1050
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:04,620
when motion pictures sucked.

1051
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:08,525
If it wasn't for this guy,
he, I'd be, I would have sank.

1052
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,362
- You sweetheart. (laughs)
- I love you.

1053
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:13,463
- Al, you sweet baby.

1054
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:14,531
- You have no idea.

1055
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:16,500
He never took a
dime of my money.

1056
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:22,372
He, he introduced me to
some great, nice people,

1057
00:47:22,405 --> 00:47:23,407
like John Schlessinger.

1058
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:29,580
I was the least qualified
of all of his boys.

1059
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:32,249
But I made a tidy sum, you know?

1060
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,918
And like Scotty's
motto always was,

1061
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,287
&quot;That's 20 bucks I never had.&quot;

1062
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,489
And that's his philosophy, and,

1063
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,958
and that's why
he's so successful.

1064
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:43,126
- That's right.

1065
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,628
You, you know, I never took
a dime from anyone, right?

1066
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,896
You bet.
- Yeah, never.

1067
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,529
Never, never, never.

1068
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:47,464
There's his book.

1069
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,999
Oh, is this you, Scott?

1070
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,600
This photo, that's you!

1071
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:53,502
You were posing sometime
in the '50s or the '60s.

1072
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:54,537
- Yeah, that is me.

1073
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,238
I remember.

1074
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,439
Did you like the book at all?

1075
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:57,607
Did you read it?
- Yeah!

1076
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,545
Everybody's reading it, and
I tell them it's all true.

1077
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:04,447
- You know, we were very close,

1078
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,483
and I fixed him up with a
lot of good tricks, didn't I?

1079
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:09,619
- You bet, and some bad ones
too like Paul Lynde, the drunk.

1080
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:11,121
- [Scotty] Oh,
remember Paul Lynde?

1081
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,589
Remember Paul Lynde?
- (sighs) Ay-yai-yai.

1082
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:13,957
- [Scotty] Jeez, Paul
was, Paul was wicked.

1083
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,192
- And George Cukor,
the salivator.

1084
00:48:16,225 --> 00:48:18,127
(laughs)

1085
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,397
Yeah, we had some
great times. (laughs)

1086
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,466
You know, I've tried working
for pimps and it's horrible.

1087
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:25,234
Scotty was never a pimp.

1088
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:29,239
He was a friend
doing another friend

1089
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:31,508
a service and helping both ends.

1090
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:35,078
And for that, I
really respect him.

1091
00:48:36,512 --> 00:48:38,448
- [Answering Machine]
Time not set.

1092
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:39,950
Message two.

1093
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:40,583
- [Dian] Hey, Scotty.

1094
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:42,452
This is Dian Hanson.

1095
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:43,687
Not sure if you remember me.

1096
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,622
We met at the Benedict Passions

1097
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:49,492
and I'd like to talk to
you about a book project.

1098
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,428
We'd like to have
you do some writing,

1099
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,330
I would work with you on it.

1100
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:57,134
It involves World War II,
so please give me a call.

1101
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,674
(Scotty whistling)

1102
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:09,613
- The Crossroads is (laughs)
same as it was, 75 years ago.

1103
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,349
And, and on a
Saturday afternoon,

1104
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,752
right here there'd be well over
1,000 servicemen in uniform.

1105
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:18,455
And this was in 1942, this
was during World War II

1106
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,557
when this took place.

1107
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,694
- We recently
found these photos.

1108
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:27,596
A guy contacted me,
a huge collection

1109
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,567
of amateur photos
from World War II.

1110
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,004
And we're gonna make
a book about this.

1111
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,106
I'm thinking of
calling it My Buddy,

1112
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,274
which is named after a song

1113
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:39,709
that was popular
in World War II.

1114
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:42,245
I mean, look at
these, walking along,

1115
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:44,481
crossing a bridge
with their dogs.

1116
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,415
- [Scotty] Everything and a hat,

1117
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,350
and the whole bit,
and the rifle, and...

1118
00:49:47,383 --> 00:49:49,486
- [Dian] And then, I found this:

1119
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,388
a man being consoled when
his buddy has been killed.

1120
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,790
- That's right, and
it's got nothing to do

1121
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:55,025
with the gay bit at all.

1122
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,227
It's just buddy-buddy.

1123
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,563
- [Dian] You offer
such a unique resource

1124
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:02,699
'cause you were Marine
who was actually there.

1125
00:50:06,402 --> 00:50:07,704
- I don't know why he, you know,

1126
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:09,606
that's not like him.

1127
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,309
But you can see, it's
just falling apart.

1128
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:14,511
It's dangerous.

1129
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:17,414
Hello.

1130
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:23,787
- It was Rod on the phone.

1131
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,255
That fucking house sold,

1132
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,157
I gotta get my stuff
out of that garage.

1133
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,558
- [Lois] Oh my God.

1134
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:29,726
- Within 10 days.

1135
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:51,181
(laughs)

1136
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,616
I'm young and
innocent-looking there,

1137
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:56,653
though I wasn't, but. (laughs)

1138
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:57,687
What's this?

1139
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,520
This a picture.

1140
00:50:58,554 --> 00:50:59,356
Is this a picture too?

1141
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:01,191
- [Matt] Can I see?

1142
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,092
Can I see?

1143
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:02,859
Which one are you?

1144
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:04,694
- Right here, right there.

1145
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,296
Here, here, here
I am right here.

1146
00:51:07,396 --> 00:51:09,699
That's my mother's
handwriting, I can see.

1147
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:13,203
That teacher, Mrs.
Ham, Ham, Hammerhand,

1148
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,605
she was a nice lady

1149
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:19,209
who liked a little
girl I was going with.

1150
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,611
I used to fix her up with
a girl I was going with

1151
00:51:21,644 --> 00:51:23,680
because she was a dyke
and her brother was gay,

1152
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,516
and I'd always trick
her brother. (laughs)

1153
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:28,284
- [Matt] How old were you?

1154
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:29,719
- Whatever I was there.

1155
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:33,423
When I was 11, yeah, probably.

1156
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:35,458
- [Matt] You didn't have
any problem with that?

1157
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:37,227
- Oh, no, fuck, are you kidding?

1158
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,629
I never had a problem with
that shit at all, baby.

1159
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:40,462
(laughs)

1160
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:41,697
Never.

1161
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,667
I was always tricking, even
when I was very young, you know,

1162
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,236
even back on the farm.

1163
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:52,809
(birds chirping)
(slow soft music)

1164
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:56,779
With the Depression
being at its full swing,

1165
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:58,647
you couldn't make a
dime from the farm.

1166
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:03,720
And certainly there, it
wasn't a lot of food.

1167
00:52:06,522 --> 00:52:08,290
My brother was two years older

1168
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,160
and my sister was
two years younger.

1169
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:14,364
I had a very nice
childhood, a good childhood.

1170
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:19,169
And that neighbor who had
two kids and everything,

1171
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,237
and his wife was a
sweetheart, and he was too,

1172
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,606
and I couldn't think of anything
but nice things about them.

1173
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:24,707
Just because he
wanted to cuddle me

1174
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,875
and hold me and jack off
me, nothing wrong with that.

1175
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:29,412
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with that, baby.

1176
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,682
- [Matt] Many people would
consider that child abuse.

1177
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:34,551
But you don't think
of yourself as abused?

1178
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:35,417
- Being abused?

1179
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:36,753
Absolutely not.

1180
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,321
I mean, this is bullshit, Matt.

1181
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:41,424
There's no such thing as
somebody ruining your life

1182
00:52:41,457 --> 00:52:42,659
when they suck your cock.

1183
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,327
The only way that
they ruin your life

1184
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,296
is when they run over you
with a bus on the street.

1185
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,531
That can ruin your life.

1186
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:49,832
And even as a little
bitty kid, Matt,

1187
00:52:49,865 --> 00:52:52,468
I never saw anything
wrong with anything.

1188
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:55,205
You know what, (laughs)

1189
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,640
I went along with everything.

1190
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,642
And I never told anybody.

1191
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:03,413
(dramatic theatrical music)

1192
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:07,750
When we moved to Chicago,

1193
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:09,452
my mother and
father had divorced,

1194
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:11,288
and I ended up later
with a stepdad.

1195
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:13,689
We moved directly
across the street

1196
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:17,260
from Holy Angels Church on
Oakwood Boulevard in Chicago.

1197
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:18,695
We had an old car
with a trailer,

1198
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,463
went loading, and a
priest introduced himself,

1199
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:22,465
and he, I could tell
by the look in his eye,

1200
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:23,733
he kind of wanted me,

1201
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:24,834
and I'm over there
staying all night

1202
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,536
with him the first
night we're there.

1203
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:28,939
And I thought, uh-oh, I
could pick up a few bucks.

1204
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:33,243
Then he proceeded to
fix me up with friends.

1205
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,444
And through him, I'd
meet other priests

1206
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,846
that I would go to their church.

1207
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:41,817
Within weeks, I had seen
approximately 25 or 30 priests.

1208
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:43,686
They'd paid me off in change:

1209
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,588
penny, nickels,
dimes, and quarters.

1210
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:47,657
Whatever they got out of the
collection box, you know?

1211
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,793
(laughs)

1212
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,930
(lively jazz music)

1213
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:56,766
I was always out
hustling around.

1214
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:58,801
And I would go
downtown, shining shoes,

1215
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,636
selling papers, selling rubbers.

1216
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,871
You know what I mean?

1217
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,273
I had that going,
and the tricking too.

1218
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:04,874
And, baby, I had a
very good thing going.

1219
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,477
You know, everybody
knew me downtown.

1220
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,611
Are you kidding?

1221
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:09,979
And they'd take me over to
their apartment and then,

1222
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:11,848
then they had
their friends over.

1223
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,383
- [Matt] Your mother
never knew that you were--

1224
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,851
- [Scotty] Never picked up,

1225
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,819
my brother and sister never
picked up on it at all.

1226
00:54:16,852 --> 00:54:19,355
My brother, Donald, did
his own little thing

1227
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:21,824
in a very square way,
never said a word to him.

1228
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:23,860
He thought I was selling
papers and magazines.

1229
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,928
I never mentioned a
trick to him at any time.

1230
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:28,298
Him, my sister, my
mother, anybody.

1231
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,968
My little thing I was doing
all by myself. (laughs)

1232
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:37,439
(jazzy theatrical music)

1233
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:40,610
Many years later, when
Dr. Kinsey met me,

1234
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:41,845
he'd already heard about me.

1235
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,717
That's why he interviewed me
about four, five or six times.

1236
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,987
Kinsey was a zoologist,

1237
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,756
and he started the
Institute of Sex Research,

1238
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,492
Indiana University
in Bloomington.

1239
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,995
- This research
has been possible

1240
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:02,531
because of tens of thousands
of people who have cooperated.

1241
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,867
- Scotty did play
an academic role

1242
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,669
in the sexual
revolution in a way,

1243
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:08,971
because he was the
connective tissue

1244
00:55:09,004 --> 00:55:11,874
between the academic Kinsey

1245
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,676
and the people
who were doing it.

1246
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:16,479
Scotty was a
revelation to Kinsey.

1247
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:17,947
- [Scotty] We became friends

1248
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,782
and he liked interviewing me.

1249
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,084
I was one of the only people

1250
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,419
that completed interview
from one end to the other,

1251
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:25,088
meaning, had done everything.

1252
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,456
It would always
start out by saying,

1253
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,957
&quot;You ever had sex with a girl?&quot;

1254
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,024
Yes.

1255
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:30,827
What did you do with, you
know, doom, doom, doom.

1256
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,661
How about with a guy?

1257
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:32,495
Yes.

1258
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:33,129
What did you do?

1259
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:34,062
Everything?

1260
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:34,997
How about with an animal?

1261
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,932
Yes.

1262
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,500
So whatever he had, I did.

1263
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:40,136
And I got him, not only
the best interviews he had,

1264
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:43,406
I took him to gang bang
parties and things like that,

1265
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:45,975
and put him in a fucking
bedroom and everybody fucking,

1266
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:48,144
and mainly guys, and
then, girls and guys.

1267
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:50,146
And, and he'd be over
there and I'd crawl over

1268
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:51,781
and reach to see if
he had a hard-on,

1269
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,016
and he'd say, &quot;Scotty, I'm
just observing, you know that.&quot;

1270
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:55,451
(laughs)

1271
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,487
I think he had a
hard-on watching.

1272
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,924
(jazzy theatrical music)

1273
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,828
- [Guard] Hi there.

1274
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:07,529
- The name is Scott, Ellie
Valiant Byron Clark's place.

1275
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,002
(panting)

1276
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:18,375
(people chattering)

1277
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,981
I do a lot of bartending.

1278
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,749
That looks full, but
it's just the ice

1279
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:27,883
that makes it look that.

1280
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,720
And I started doing it,
shortly after the gas station.

1281
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,157
I left the gas station
after about 10 years.

1282
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,492
You know, the, the
station got so busy,

1283
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:38,027
and I thought, the vice squad

1284
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,996
has got to get onto
this eventually.

1285
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:41,998
There's a vodka.

1286
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,700
Even though I was in
full swing of tricking,

1287
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:46,636
people that I knew
started, you know,

1288
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,937
when, I'm having a party, why
don't you tend bar for me,

1289
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:49,772
things like that.

1290
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:51,040
So I proceeded to that.

1291
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:52,074
- Read your book.

1292
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:53,109
You behaved yourself.

1293
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:55,511
(laughs)

1294
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,584
- The desk needs
cleaning, that's true.

1295
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:04,787
But in the meantime, I
know where things are,

1296
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,089
and it's not exactly in file,

1297
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:09,192
it's just written down
on available space.

1298
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,127
- [Matt] When you were
writing down a trick,

1299
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,095
it was the same thing?

1300
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,729
- Yeah, but when I was
writing down tricks,

1301
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:15,965
I didn't, it wasn't
lying around.

1302
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:17,100
It was in my pocket,

1303
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,002
and it was for the moment.

1304
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:22,071
And the moment that
was taken care of,

1305
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:25,006
it was torn up and, really
torn up and thrown away.

1306
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,008
You follow what I mean?

1307
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,577
- [Matt] So you did that
because you were worried

1308
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,811
Confidential might pick it up?

1309
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:30,480
- 'Cause they could,
those son of a bitches

1310
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,614
went through garbage
and everything,

1311
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,582
you know what I'm talking about.

1312
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,482
- [Matt] Confidential?

1313
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:34,617
- Oh, yeah.

1314
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,021
♪ You got to accentuate
the positive ♪

1315
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:40,623
♪ Eliminate the negative ♪

1316
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:42,124
- [Scotty] There was a paper
much like the Enquirer,

1317
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:43,860
called Confidential.

1318
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,063
Confidential was a red-hot thing

1319
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:50,600
where they exposed anyone that
was well-known that was gay.

1320
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,069
♪ You got to spread joy ♪

1321
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,770
♪ Up to the maximum ♪

00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:56,571
♪ Bring gloom down

1323
00:57:56,605 --> 00:58:00,977
- I am going to file a
$25 million libel suit

1324
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,080
against Confidential Magazine.

1325
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,647
- If it was written
that you were gay

1326
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:08,084
in Confidential Magazine,
your career was over.

1327
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:12,154
- Confidential came as
close as you ever could

1328
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:15,758
to toppling the whole
house of cards here.

1329
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,793
- [Scotty] Confidential
came to me with stories

1330
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:19,896
that they had already
written and said,

1331
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,597
you just have to sign the story

1332
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,066
and say the story is true.

1333
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:26,702
They'd hand you an
envelope with $1,000 in,

1334
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:29,038
and most people would've
signed for $1,000.

1335
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:34,043
One story was at Frank
Sinatra's house in Palm Springs,

1336
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,715
when I had a three-way with
Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.

1337
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:42,785
Ava Gardner and Lana Turner,

1338
00:58:42,818 --> 00:58:45,955
they were buddy-buddy
in those days, you know?

1339
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:47,589
They were a little stoned,

1340
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:49,692
and they were in the
pool in the nude,

1341
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:51,961
and pretty soon we're
in bed together.

1342
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,195
The word got around.

1343
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:54,997
You know how the
word gets around?

1344
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,134
Confidential came to
me with a story first,

1345
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,769
and that's one they
wanted me to sign

1346
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,237
and I wouldn't sign it.

1347
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,872
After I wouldn't sign it,

1348
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:04,640
they grabbed two
other guys who signed

1349
00:59:04,673 --> 00:59:06,008
and went for the money.

1350
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,978
(slow bluesy music)

1351
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:10,179
- He declined to do it.

1352
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:13,182
I'm sure he could've
used the money.

1353
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,985
$1,000 was a lot more
back then than it is now.

1354
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:18,821
But his personal code of honor

1355
00:59:18,854 --> 00:59:20,156
prevented him from doing that.

1356
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,095
- Hello, baby.

1357
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:28,197
Hi sweetheart.

1358
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,632
That's a pretty kitty.

1359
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:31,267
Just look at that
pretty little thing.

1360
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:38,107
Chicken dinner,
tender chicken dinner.

1361
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,777
Gotta get some of that. (laughs)

1362
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:44,212
Tender chicken dinner
for my kitties.

1363
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:51,887
Look at the size
of that cat food.

1364
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,222
It's a little bitty thing,

1365
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,359
and that particular
thing was $1.69 plus tax.

1366
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,195
That's fucking you when
they charge you that much

1367
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,397
for a little bitty
can of food like that.

1368
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:02,330
I always, when I go over there,

1369
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,100
I always throw a couple,
three in my pocket

1370
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,334
for my little kitty, you know.

1371
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:07,203
And, all she does
when you open it is,

1372
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,804
lick the moisture off of it,

1373
01:00:08,837 --> 01:00:10,006
eat a couple of little bites,

1374
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,141
and then I put the rest
out for the skunks.

1375
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:22,284
Do you want me to
show you that picture?

1376
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:23,152
- [Matt] Sure.

1377
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:28,723
- Baby was a wonderful
little doggie

1378
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:30,326
that came to the house.

1379
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,294
She just all of a
sudden appeared one day

1380
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:35,031
and she was my
baby from then on.

1381
01:00:45,774 --> 01:00:47,676
Oh, here I got a book
I wanna show you.

1382
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,781
This is by Cecil Beaton.

1383
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,116
He liked to be called
Cecil, you know. (laughs)

1384
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,952
Cecil was very grand, you know.

1385
01:00:56,985 --> 01:00:59,689
&quot;Don't call me Cee-cil,
the name is Sesille.&quot;

1386
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,023
He's a great photographer,

1387
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:02,992
and he photographed
the Royal family.

1388
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:05,228
And somebody gave me
this and I'm in it.

1389
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,297
There it is, Scotty.

1390
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:11,300
&quot;Scotty is a phenomenon.

1391
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,234
&quot;I heard several years ago

1392
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,036
&quot;that the police had
caught up with him,

1393
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:17,073
&quot;that he quit his racket
and was out of the running.

1394
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,309
&quot;This is a blow to me
'cause I'm very fond of him.

1395
01:01:20,342 --> 01:01:22,912
&quot;But no, Scotty appeared
among the bushes

1396
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,748
&quot;at a Beverly Hills
bungalows with his smiling

1397
01:01:25,781 --> 01:01:27,283
&quot;and trimmed form as ever.

1398
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,354
&quot;He still continues his
nefarious activities.&quot;

1399
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:35,324
- [Matt] It's like you
were hiding in plain sight.

1400
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:37,060
You were always very discreet.

1401
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:39,794
- No, but it was
just like, Matt,

1402
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:43,032
when I took people to
see Wally and Edward,

1403
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:45,433
I never told one person,

1404
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:47,403
even though they
were close buddies.

1405
01:01:47,436 --> 01:01:49,739
And they were seeing
the Duke and Duchess.

1406
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,308
When I met the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor,

1407
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,845
he said, &quot;You came so
highly recommended.

1408
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:59,014
&quot;Cecil Beaton's told me
about you numerous times.&quot;

1409
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:02,051
And he said, &quot;I feel
that I know you.&quot;

1410
01:02:02,084 --> 01:02:05,988
- The Duchess and I
are actually very glad

1411
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:08,157
to set foot in America again.

1412
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,127
- My friend was a manager
of the Beverly Hills Hotel,

1413
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,395
so I would get a bungalow

1414
01:02:13,428 --> 01:02:15,131
at the Beverly Hills
Hotel for a whole week,

1415
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,099
and then flood them with people.

1416
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:18,768
As you know, the bungalows
there, even today,

1417
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,536
you can walk straight
into from the street.

1418
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:22,271
It was easy to get
people in and out

1419
01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:24,407
and never ask who
was there at all.

1420
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:27,910
Two at a time, sometimes
three at a time,

1421
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:29,779
but usually two at a time.

1422
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,781
Maybe I'd bring a guy
and a girl or both;

1423
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,783
a girl for her, a guy for him.

1424
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,520
He'd like to see guys
and girls together,

1425
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:40,321
and then, sort of
work his way in.

1426
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:43,359
And when a guy wants to see
a guy and girl together,

1427
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,528
they're usually gay or
have tendency of being gay,

1428
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:46,529
because if they were straight,

1429
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:48,430
why would they want the guy?

1430
01:02:48,463 --> 01:02:50,132
She's the one that
would do the talking.

1431
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:51,967
He'd sit there this whole
time and not say a word,

1432
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,569
he was very shy and bashful.

1433
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:55,904
She's the one that would
say we're gonna do this,

1434
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,239
we're gonna do that,
we'll suck his cock.

1435
01:02:57,272 --> 01:02:58,073
Do this, do that.

1436
01:02:58,106 --> 01:02:59,341
You know what I mean?

1437
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:01,944
I mean, you know, she
was a real ballsy chick.

1438
01:03:01,977 --> 01:03:04,113
But they thought what I did

1439
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:06,482
was the nicest thing that
ever happened to them.

1440
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,986
If Eddie and them were
around now, and Ronnie,

1441
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:13,122
I might tell them now,
now the book is out,

1442
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:14,423
&quot;That was, that was
them that you saw

1443
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:15,892
&quot;at the Beverly Hills Hotel.&quot;

1444
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:27,870
(birds chirping)

1445
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:31,073
It just, it seems like
I just keep adding.

1446
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:32,408
You know, I'd come in,
I'd throw this there,

1447
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,475
and this there, and...

1448
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:36,345
- [Matt] Do you still
work at the desk or is--

1449
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:38,080
- No, I can't get
to the desk now.

1450
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:40,549
I'll eventually get there again.

1451
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,221
Look how pretty that tiger is.

1452
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,156
It just came in,
someone brought it in,

1453
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:48,357
at Out of the Closet,

1454
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,391
and I said, &quot;How much?&quot;

1455
01:03:49,424 --> 01:03:50,960
And he said three bucks.

1456
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:54,397
It looks kind of
real, doesn't it?

1457
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:57,933
- It's horrible.

1458
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:00,536
We just can't live like this.

1459
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:01,871
It's dangerous.

1460
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,206
I was talking
about getting help,

1461
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:05,608
but you can't get help
until you cleaned,

1462
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,943
had the house cleaned out.

1463
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:11,480
And one way to do it is
to call Social Services.

1464
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:14,283
It would be considered
elder abuse for him

1465
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:15,517
to make it dangerous for me

1466
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,420
to walk through the
house every day.

1467
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,022
And I can't do that.

1468
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:25,995
- All these bags here are new.

1469
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,196
- [Matt] Do you think
that it's compulsive?

1470
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:31,133
- You see, if you
don't have control,

1471
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,501
the world will fall apart.

1472
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:34,904
And I'm sure the
war did this to him.

1473
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,272
- [Matt] Do you think Scotty
could've used some therapy?

1474
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,241
- No, I don't know that
that would've done any good

1475
01:04:39,274 --> 01:04:41,310
because he doesn't
believe in it.

1476
01:04:41,343 --> 01:04:42,645
But normally that's,

1477
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,380
should've been with all--
- I'm the one that,

1478
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,547
I'm the one that gives
therapy to people.

1479
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,316
I don't need therapy.

1480
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:48,550
(both laugh)

1481
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,386
- [Matt] A lot of
people would say

1482
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,221
what you did all
your life was wrong.

1483
01:04:53,255 --> 01:04:54,390
- You're kidding?

1484
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,558
I mean I, I think it was right.

1485
01:04:57,592 --> 01:05:00,029
- [Matt] Probably
because you were damaged

1486
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,563
when you were a child.

1487
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:02,597
- Oh, yeah, bullshit.

1488
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:06,067
I mean, that, that's
damage, but hey. (laughs)

1489
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:07,403
- [Matt] Someone
needed to tell you

1490
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,471
that you were traumatized.

1491
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:11,440
- I did what I did
because I wanted to do it

1492
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:12,942
and knew what I was doing

1493
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,477
and it wasn't a case of
accidentally or anything.

1494
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:17,579
Anything you do, you best
better blame yourself

1495
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:19,014
and forget that
bullshit of coming up

1496
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,449
and blaming someone else.
- But you don't.

1497
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:22,284
- No, I don't blame
someone else for anything.

1498
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:23,552
- [Lois] You don't
blame yourself, either.

1499
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:24,586
- I don't blame myself.

1500
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:25,387
I've done nothing wrong.

1501
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,455
Why do I blame myself?

1502
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,741
Today, tomorrow, and forever.

1503
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:47,176
Bette and Scotty.

1504
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,678
- [Matt] You and
Bette never married.

1505
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:51,546
Did she change her
name to Bowers?

1506
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,649
- Oh, yeah, she
changed it to Bowers.

1507
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:00,222
When I was in Seattle,
before I was discharged,

1508
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:02,658
I met Bette in town
at the Olympic Hotel.

1509
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,997
It naturally brings
back memories, you know.

1510
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,366
- [Matt] Good ones or bad ones?

1511
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,667
- Oh no, they were good ones.

1512
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:16,205
Of course, I'd naturally get
pictures of Bette like that.

1513
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,173
(laughs)

1514
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:21,643
A lot of romances turn cold
as you know what I mean.

1515
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:23,379
But at the time it was great.

1516
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,648
No, Bette was a good Joe.

1517
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:28,150
Son of a bitch, she was.

1518
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:33,288
It's just a shame that I
was not a one-person person.

1519
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:35,391
I had too many things to do.

1520
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:36,459
If anyone was to blame

1521
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,529
for not making it work
over the years, it was me,

1522
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:42,531
because I wasn't a
stay-at-home person.

1523
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:43,632
You know what I mean?

1524
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,236
- [Matt] Did she know
you were doing tricks?

1525
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,071
- Even though I didn't sit
and discuss it with her,

1526
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:52,441
she'd have to know because
I was so busy doing that.

1527
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:57,113
You know, I bought the house
up on St. Andrews for Bette.

1528
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,649
I'd saved my money
from tricking.

1529
01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:02,151
Stash it away, you know.

1530
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:06,655
You gotta see my nice
new roof here, baby.

1531
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,490
In 52 years, it
only had two roofs.

1532
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,026
So this will be the third one.

1533
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,430
I put this fucking roof
on 52 years ago by myself.

1534
01:07:15,597 --> 01:07:18,500
Bette and I, we just bought
the house for $22,000

1535
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,768
and she and my little daughter

1536
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:21,370
were very excited to come here.

1537
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:23,705
We only lived a short
distance away from here.

1538
01:07:25,173 --> 01:07:27,575
I mean, I was always in
the neighborhood here.

1539
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:28,677
And we--

1540
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,712
- [Matt] Did you guys go
out to dinner to celebrate?

1541
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:33,482
- Oh no, I went out and
turned a couple of tricks.

1542
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:34,583
I was, you know, I was busy.

1543
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:36,452
I didn't do that
fucking dinner bit.

1544
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:37,719
When you're busy, you're busy.

1545
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:39,587
And I was busy every
day and every night.

1546
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:41,690
I didn't have, which
I'm sorry to say,

1547
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:43,225
I didn't have time to do that.

1548
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,595
- [Matt] You're sorry to say?

1549
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:47,529
You wished you could have?

1550
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:49,163
- Well, I should have, I guess,

1551
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,700
spent more time with
them, which I didn't.

1552
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:53,502
I don't know, maybe,
maybe I did take her

1553
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:55,636
out to dinner on
her birthday once.

1554
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,339
(laughs) Once.

1555
01:07:57,372 --> 01:07:58,640
Maybe I did once.

1556
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,117
It was very nice to have
a pretty little baby.

1557
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,885
She was a good girl.

1558
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,720
This was Donna's
little room here.

1559
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:13,789
Donna's clothes are
still in the closet.

1560
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:17,359
And she went to school
and never missed a day,

1561
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:19,627
and went from grammar
school to high school

1562
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:21,596
at Hollywood High,
and then to college,

1563
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,365
and finished college, and,

1564
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:25,835
and then she died.

1565
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:30,506
Here's a picture
of her here, too.

1566
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:32,541
She had an abortion.

1567
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:36,411
And within three or four days
after having the abortion,

1568
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:38,347
she went into a coma
and never came out.

1569
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,549
She had an abortion by some,

1570
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:43,319
obviously, quack doctor back
in those days, you know.

1571
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:45,653
And she was 23.

1572
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:50,159
(slow soft music)

1573
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,796
And her phone is still there
with the same number. (laughs)

1574
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,699
I didn't go around
saying anything.

1575
01:08:57,732 --> 01:08:59,635
Within an hour after
I learned she died,

1576
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:03,438
I'm on my way to Malibu to a
party with a carload of guys.

1577
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:07,276
I was 100% dependable, reliable,
whatever you wanna call it,

1578
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,378
regardless of what it was.

1579
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:10,645
None of that bullshit:

1580
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,214
It's too cold today,
it's raining today,

1581
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:13,749
or whatever might happen.

1582
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:17,219
If I told someone I was
gonna be there, I'd be there.

1583
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:19,855
I never said anything to
anyone about what had happened.

1584
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:24,359
- A number of people deal,
deal with grief that way.

1585
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:28,496
They stay on their regular
path, keep your regular routine.

1586
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:35,905
(birds chirping)
(slow soft music)

1587
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:44,846
- I want to get somebody to
trim all the trees over there,

1588
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:47,916
the bushes over
here, this thing.

1589
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:49,317
- I'm gonna cut that.
- Uh huh.

1590
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,818
- Soon as my arm is better,

1591
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:51,953
I'll cut that.
- Yeah, sure.

1592
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:53,589
I'm gonna hire somebody.

1593
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,923
- No you aren't.
- Yes I am.

1594
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:56,358
- No you aren't.
- Yes I am.

1595
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:56,991
- [Scotty] Oh, no.

1596
01:09:57,025 --> 01:09:58,427
Are you kidding?

1597
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,762
I can do it far better
than they can do it.

1598
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:04,300
(soft bluesy piano music)

1599
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:10,739
- You know, they've
asked me why do I stay.

1600
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:11,873
'Cause I love him.

1601
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,675
And somebody asked me why,
and I said, I don't know,

1602
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,678
it's just, you just do.

1603
01:10:17,312 --> 01:10:20,415
And, mainly because
of the way he is,

1604
01:10:20,448 --> 01:10:24,519
his sense of humor,
his warmth, his caring.

1605
01:10:24,552 --> 01:10:25,719
You know, they don't just go

1606
01:10:25,753 --> 01:10:30,960
to the profession he chose
years ago, they go into life.

1607
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:32,828
He likes to make people happy,

1608
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:36,298
but I see it as a terrific need.

1609
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:40,702
It must be a chore to have to
want everybody to be happy.

1610
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:44,373
- [Matt] But you didn't
know until the book,

1611
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,875
to what lengths Scotty
went to make people happy.

1612
01:10:46,908 --> 01:10:49,911
- (laughs) No, no I didn't.

1613
01:10:49,944 --> 01:10:53,282
(people chattering)

1614
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,282
- [Woman] Oh my god.

1615
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:58,987
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1616
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:04,760

1617
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:10,266

01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,771

1619
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,543
(crowd cheering)

1620
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,550
- Clever, the way they'd
made that phone, wasn't it?

1621
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:31,987
(laughs) That was good.

1622
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,031
I even had a card from my sister

1623
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:44,733
as recently as two days ago.

1624
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,501
From my sister, it says,

1625
01:11:47,535 --> 01:11:49,338
&quot;Happy birthday, brother.

1626
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:50,973
&quot;Remember how I
used to tease you

1627
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,875
&quot;and it really got
on your nerves?&quot;

1628
01:11:53,908 --> 01:11:55,077
And you open that fucking card,

1629
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,846
it's upside down and it said,

1630
01:11:57,879 --> 01:11:59,848
&quot;I'm not finished
yet, have a good one.

1631
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,917
&quot;Loads of love,
Phyllis and Barney.&quot;

1632
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,989
(phone ringing)

1633
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:08,890
- [Phyllis] Hello?

1634
01:12:08,923 --> 01:12:10,425
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello?

1635
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:11,393
- [Scotty] It's me.

1636
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,961
- [Phyllis] Okay.

1637
01:12:12,994 --> 01:12:14,396
- How are you?

1638
01:12:14,429 --> 01:12:15,664
- [Phyllis] I'm,
I'm good, George.

1639
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:16,498
How are you?

1640
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:17,433
- What happened to you?

1641
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,801
- [Phyllis] Well,
I just fell down

1642
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:22,871
and they picked me
up and I'm over here

1643
01:12:22,904 --> 01:12:24,573
in the nursing home right now.

1644
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,007
- But you're going home, though?

1645
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,843
- [Phyllis] Well,
not for a week.

1646
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,911
- [Scotty] Is there
anything you need at all?

1647
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:30,845
- [Phyllis] No, not really.

1648
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,914
Just to hear from you
sounded wonderful.

1649
01:12:32,947 --> 01:12:35,050
- I'll call you
back again tomorrow.

1650
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,119
(phone dialing)

1651
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,453
Dale.

1652
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:39,087
- [Dale] Yeah?

1653
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,455
- Scotty.

1654
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:41,390
Well, you, you
mentioned that book,

1655
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,624
that book, I had forgotten

1656
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:44,760
about that book you've
talked to me about.

1657
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,728
- [Dale] Uh-huh.

1658
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:46,829
Yeah, Full Service?
- Full Service, yeah.

1659
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,597
- [Dale] Yeah, it was, that
was a pretty good book.

1660
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,798
- Well, hey.

1661
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:51,666
Well, don't give it to your
mom 'cause it'll upset her.

1662
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:52,867
You know what I mean?

1663
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,003
- [Dale] Oh, no, well,
I, I already did.

1664
01:12:57,772 --> 01:12:58,974
- She's upset over what?

1665
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:12,120
- That's why I said,
don't show it to her.

1666
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:12,921
- [Dale] Yeah.

1667
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:14,589
Yeah, I won't show
it to her again.

1668
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:15,757
- [Scotty] Now don't
forget that, okay?

1669
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,758
- [Dale] No, I won't.

1670
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:17,893
- [Scotty] Okay, baby.

1671
01:13:18,726 --> 01:13:21,730
(people chattering)

1672
01:13:24,632 --> 01:13:25,534
- Was there ever any discussion

1673
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,903
about the need for subterfuge

1674
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,505
and to leave the
life in the closet?

1675
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:33,174
Or was it just something
that everyone knew?

1676
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,910
- It's just the way it was then.

1677
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,446
They had to play it
very cool, you know?

1678
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,049
- What, what can you
say about, if anything,

1679
01:13:41,082 --> 01:13:42,717
about Katherine Hepburn?

1680
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,020
- [Scotty] Katherine
Hepburn would've liked you.

1681
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,622
(group laughs)

1682
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,691
And Katherine Hepburn
was not really nice

1683
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:51,560
to Spencer Tracy, you know?

1684
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,494
- Because?

1685
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:54,129
You have any idea why that was?

1686
01:13:54,162 --> 01:13:55,997
Because he was married, or what?

1687
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,699
- [Scotty] No.

1688
01:13:57,732 --> 01:13:59,000
They were merely friends,

1689
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:02,037
and they were in business
together, show business.

1690
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,607
And they were not in the bed
department together at all.

1691
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,842
- Never?
- Never.

1692
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:12,581
(soft theatrical music)

1693
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:17,119
All these movie
magazines sold a story.

1694
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:19,821
And that's why so many
square people say,

1695
01:14:19,854 --> 01:14:21,089
&quot;Oh, I thought they
were lovers,&quot; you know.

1696
01:14:21,122 --> 01:14:24,626
And I said, &quot;Well, they, they
weren't, but it sounds good.&quot;

1697
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,063
- The story of Hepburn and Tracy

1698
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,830
is one of the best examples

1699
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:32,034
of Hollywood crafting
a public image.

1700
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,537
George Cukor
directed some of the,

1701
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,906
the greatest
Hepburn/Tracy films.

1702
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:42,711
Spencer Tracy lived on the
grounds at George Cukor's house,

1703
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,279
but he was still
married to his wife,

1704
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:46,147
who, who he loved very much,

1705
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,782
and there's always
been the presumption

1706
01:14:47,815 --> 01:14:49,150
that he and Hepburn
lived together

1707
01:14:49,183 --> 01:14:50,986
in that little, little cottage.

1708
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,721
In fact, they did
not live together.

1709
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:56,558
There was another cottage
that, where Hepburn lived.

1710
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,760
Hepburn in later years
tried to make it seem

1711
01:14:58,793 --> 01:15:01,029
as if they were living
in a cottage together

1712
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:03,965
sharing a household
like man and wife.

1713
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:06,800
- Remember that night
when, oh, I don't know,

1714
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:09,004
you felt so
disturbed and I said,

1715
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,238
&quot;Well, go on in.

1716
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:12,641
&quot;Go to bed, I'll
talk you to sleep.

1717
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,643
&quot;I'll just talk and talk and

1718
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,279
&quot;you'll be so bored,
you're bound to drift off.&quot;

1719
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:18,680
- It was not that way.

1720
01:15:18,713 --> 01:15:19,915
They were not living together.

1721
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,149
They never lived together.

1722
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,852
(slow soft theatrical music)

1723
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:27,889
- She was a designer
of her own legend.

1724
01:15:27,922 --> 01:15:32,093
And she had several
fervent relationships

1725
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:35,096
with talented other women.

1726
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:39,268
She was very guarded
about what she did.

1727
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:44,139
- [Scotty] George kind
of told Katherine Hepburn

1728
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:48,175
early in the game what I
did, you know, in a way.

1729
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:50,045
Then, I could see running
it through her head,

1730
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,646
well if he fixes up guys,

1731
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,948
he should be able
to fix up girls too.

1732
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,215
With a girl, you
know what I mean?

1733
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:56,617
I could see that. (laughs)

1734
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:59,120
I fixed her up with
every bit of 150 girls.

1735
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:01,256
And people says, &quot;How
would she see that many?&quot;

1736
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,124
I said, this was over
a period of 39 years,

1737
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:04,893
that's almost 50 years.

1738
01:16:04,926 --> 01:16:06,695
I mean, that's not
unusual at all.

1739
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:08,997
- [William] The
traditional image

1740
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,166
is that Tracy bullied Hepburn.

1741
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,067
This was not true.

1742
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,134
- Ow!

1743
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:15,170
What are you doing?

1744
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,771
- Testing.

1745
01:16:16,804 --> 01:16:18,106
- She wouldn't have tolerated
that kind of behavior

1746
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:19,040
from anyone.

1747
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,175
I began to understand
that if, in fact,

1748
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,945
there were conflicts
between Hepburn and Tracy,

1749
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:25,146
they went both ways.

1750
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,115
And she was not happy
about his drinking

1751
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,084
or his friendship with Scotty.

1752
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,253
Scotty would come
down to Cukor's house,

1753
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:34,156
specifically to
see Spencer Tracy.

1754
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,792
- I'd get a ride there at
five o'clock in the evening.

1755
01:16:37,825 --> 01:16:39,260
At two o'clock in the morning,

1756
01:16:39,293 --> 01:16:41,795
I'm still sitting at the kitchen
table listening to him talk

1757
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:42,831
and going (mumbles),

1758
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,167
and I'd better go to bed now

1759
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,869
and he'd get up and almost fall,

1760
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:49,938
and he'd put his arm around
me and we would go to bed.

1761
01:16:51,305 --> 01:16:53,208
But then the next morning,
he would always say,

1762
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,076
&quot;Geez, I must've gotten
drunk last night.

1763
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,012
&quot;You were so nice to stay.&quot;

1764
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,848
Just like nothing ever happened,
it was always the same.

1765
01:17:01,315 --> 01:17:02,983
He really didn't want to be gay,

1766
01:17:03,017 --> 01:17:06,187
or admit to himself
he might possibly be.

1767
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:08,323
And so the best way is
not to admit it, right?

1768
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,193
- Uh, (laughs) I can't
handle this in my head,

1769
01:17:12,226 --> 01:17:13,629
it, it rocks me.

1770
01:17:15,129 --> 01:17:20,035
- The ironic thing is that it
was somehow more acceptable

1771
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:25,073
to the general public to be
in an adulterous relationship

1772
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,242
than it was to be
gay or lesbian.

1773
01:17:28,976 --> 01:17:33,281
- But the whole thing about
being gay in Hollywood,

1774
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:37,285
if you played along,
you were okay.

1775
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:40,155
The studio executives
did not really care

1776
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,923
if someone was gay or not.

1777
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:44,393
They only cared about
your public persona.

1778
01:17:45,426 --> 01:17:48,029
You know, in Hollywood,
everyone knew

1779
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:49,364
that Rock Hudson was gay.

1780
01:17:49,397 --> 01:17:51,232
- [Announcer] Rock
Hudson, selected

1781
01:17:51,265 --> 01:17:53,234
as the Most Popular
Film Actor of the Year.

1782
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:55,202
This is the second year in a row

1783
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:56,371
that Mr. Hudson has been picked

1784
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:59,307
by Modern Screen as
Most Popular Actor.

1785
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,178
- But, his sexuality
became really a problem

1786
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:07,215
when Life Magazine had
done a cover story on him.

1787
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:10,351
It said that he was
approaching 30 years old

1788
01:18:10,384 --> 01:18:12,921
and it was about time
for him to get married,

1789
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,188
and if he didn't get married,

1790
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,291
he needed to tell his fans why.

1791
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:18,960
And like, a month or two later,

1792
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:22,197
he married his agent's
secretary, Phyllis Gates.

1793
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:24,833
- [Scotty] And of
course, Rock was gay,

1794
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,268
Phyllis was gay, and
nothing happened.

1795
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:30,972
- It became kind of an
open joke in Hollywood.

1796
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:34,342
Everyone kind of knew that
this was an arranged marriage,

1797
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:37,212
but it was very important
to sell that myth.

1798
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,481
It was about reflecting back

1799
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,283
a very traditional middle-class,

1800
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:44,318
middle America viewpoint.

1801
01:18:45,486 --> 01:18:48,223
The truth of that was, was
something very, very different.

1802
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:54,830
(traffic humming)

1803
01:18:57,932 --> 01:18:59,233
- Oh, that and that's the book?

1804
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,068
Jesus.

1805
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:02,269
Introduction by
Scotty Bowers with,

1806
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:06,007
with text by Gore Vidal,
with James Jones. (laughs)

1807
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,242
Isn't that...

1808
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,777
Everything Dian
does is you know,

1809
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,546
she should've designed
weapons during World War II.

1810
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:13,315
- (laughs) Yeah, right.

1811
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,050
- I was wondering if you could
just start by talking to us

1812
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,253
about the buddy system,
sort of how it worked

1813
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,121
and why it was created.

1814
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:21,356
- When you're in
the Marine Corps,

1815
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,024
the closest thing to
you is your buddy,

1816
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:25,426
you might say your
foxhole buddy,

1817
01:19:25,459 --> 01:19:28,396
who watches out for you
and you watch out for him.

1818
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:29,397
- Scotty really had it tough.

1819
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:34,135
I mean, he was in three,
just horrific battles

1820
01:19:34,168 --> 01:19:36,103
without much down time, right?

1821
01:19:36,137 --> 01:19:38,072
I mean, you were fighting
four months straight

1822
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:39,174
on Guadalcanal.

1823
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,409
- And Bougainville, two months.

1824
01:19:41,442 --> 01:19:43,878
- He developed the buddy
system in World War II,

1825
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,547
because they found that the men

1826
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,516
were able to hold up
in battle with a buddy.

1827
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:52,153
- Young guys who just left
home for the first time

1828
01:19:52,186 --> 01:19:54,589
to go in the service,
the closest thing to you

1829
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:56,424
is your buddy, you
know what I mean?

1830
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:59,327
Your so-called
foxhole buddy is the

1831
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,361
closest thing you have.

1832
01:20:00,394 --> 01:20:02,097
It's the best friend you have.

1833
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,408
Service record World War II

1834
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,411
was put out by Grand
Ridge Community.

1835
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,880
So it was a little town
in the area I was born.

1836
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,518
That's my brother right there.

1837
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,323
Camp Elliott.

1838
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:31,425
Finished training in Hawaii,

1839
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,428
participated in the
Battle of Iwo Jima,

1840
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:37,566
lost his life March 4, 1945.

1841
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,404
My brother was two
years older than me.

1842
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:45,473
He went in the Marine
Corps two years after I did

1843
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:47,542
because he was working.

1844
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:51,980
He went into Iwo
Jima, and on Iwo Jima,

1845
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:55,516
we had 7,000 guys
killed in 28 days

1846
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:58,419
and about 20,000 wounded.

1847
01:20:58,452 --> 01:21:01,423
(slow somber music)

1848
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:06,394
Every time I see some,

1849
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:11,599
it reminds me of
my brother. (weeps)

1850
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,269
Every time I see someone,

1851
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,172
it reminds me of my
brother, I liked...

1852
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,513
(slow somber music)

1853
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:30,418
(stammers) It runs through
your mind quite often,

1854
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:31,552
you know what I mean?

1855
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:33,288
You, you don't forget things.

1856
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,257
Some people forget
things, but I don't.

1857
01:21:38,626 --> 01:21:40,228
It comes back.

1858
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:42,998
I have, I still have
dreams about it at night.

1859
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:49,536
Oh, yeah, you try to
put it out of your mind,

1860
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:50,472
but it's still there.

1861
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:55,143
(slow somber music)

1862
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:03,285
It made me fucking
happy to be alive.

1863
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:18,199
December, well, Beach
died December the 7th.

1864
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:20,101
They sent the ashes to Pat.

1865
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:22,704
He got them, put them in
the trunk of his car saying,

1866
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,973
&quot;We're gonna go up to Beach's
and spread the ashes.&quot;

1867
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:28,109
And that was six
years ago. (laughs)

1868
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:29,477
During the war, Pat
was in the Navy,

1869
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,346
Beach was in the Army, and
I was in the Marine Corps.

1870
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,048
We represented
all three outfits.

1871
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,673
(crow bar clamors)

1872
01:23:22,129 --> 01:23:23,664
Seven years later,

1873
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:25,266
and Beach wanted them
dumped over the patio,

1874
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:27,235
so I'm gonna dump them
over the patio here.

1875
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,403
The wind is blowing
a little bit,

1876
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,605
so I think I'll dump them here.

1877
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:32,640
I think I'll just dump
them right down here.

1878
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:40,749
(slow somber music)

1879
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:49,424
If I dump them here,
they'll last longer there.

1880
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:51,259
You know, you know what this
reminds me very much of?

1881
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:54,595
Throwing guys overboard, a
fucking dead guy's aboard ship,

1882
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:55,429
you throw them overboard,

1883
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:57,131
just like you do
the fucking garbage.

1884
01:23:57,164 --> 01:23:58,599
Now people think
they had burials.

1885
01:23:58,632 --> 01:23:59,433
Bull shit.

1886
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,434
You just,

1887
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,470
you grab one, then
another, and then another,

1888
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:05,072
and another, you just keep
pitching them overboard.

1889
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:07,642
And that's what they
did in World War II.

1890
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:10,645
(somber opera music)

1891
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,563
My baby Beach's ashes are
over the side of the hill

1892
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:29,664
where he wanted them.

1893
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:33,701
(somber opera music)

1894
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:38,239
Yeah, without a doubt,
Beach was a good person.

1895
01:24:39,406 --> 01:24:41,676
A good person, and
always very nice to me.

1896
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,680
(somber opera music)

1897
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:50,652
The bad things
that happened were:

1898
01:24:52,686 --> 01:24:54,422
my brother, my daughter,

1899
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,724
Bette,

1900
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:59,293
and the most recent one
was my little doggie dying

1901
01:24:59,326 --> 01:25:00,462
that I loved so much.

1902
01:25:01,595 --> 01:25:02,763
And you're gonna
say that's foolish.

1903
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:04,599
It's not foolish.

1904
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:07,168
Can you understand how I could
love a little doggie or not?

1905
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:07,802
- [Matt] I can.

1906
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:12,206
- [Scotty] Some people don't,
that's why I don't tell them.

1907
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,407
- [Matt] You've had some
pretty terrible things happen

1908
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:15,342
in your life.

1909
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,777
Do you think that
you've had to keep busy

1910
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,713
to not think about] your
brother and the others?

1911
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:19,747
- [Scotty] Yes, yes, I do.

1912
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,682
I created happy things,

1913
01:25:21,715 --> 01:25:25,386
and making people happy
to kind of compensate

1914
01:25:25,419 --> 01:25:27,288
for the unhappy things.

1915
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:28,790
Do you think that's possible?

1916
01:25:30,524 --> 01:25:31,625
- [Matt] That many good years,

1917
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,930
the late '40s and the '50s
were such a glorious time--

1918
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:37,331
- [Scotty] It was
a glorious time

1919
01:25:37,364 --> 01:25:38,799
because nothing bad happened

1920
01:25:38,832 --> 01:25:41,602
to anyone, you could do
as many people as you want

1921
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:43,504
and fuck around as
much as you want.

1922
01:25:43,537 --> 01:25:45,907
Things really didn't
change along those lines

1923
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,474
until AIDS came along.

1924
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,411
(slow somber music)

1925
01:25:50,444 --> 01:25:52,213
When I think of all
the people that I knew,

1926
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:54,415
who not only had AIDS,
but died of AIDS,

1927
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:57,351
I mean, a lot of them,
not some, but a lot.

1928
01:25:57,384 --> 01:25:58,286
And I mean, a lot.

1929
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,258
Look at, look at Rock Hudson.

1930
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:06,928
That AIDS was a very sad thing.

1931
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:08,696
Is a very sad thing.

1932
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:11,499
(slow soft piano music)

1933
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:12,867
Rock was a good friend of mine.

1934
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,768
He changed so much
in appearance,

1935
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:16,971
you hardly knew
him in a matter of

1936
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:18,306
two or three months.

1937
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:20,775
I remember when he
went off to Paris

1938
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,711
thinking they're gonna cure
him in France or something.

1939
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,982
- Hollywood was shocked
by the Rock Hudson story

1940
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:31,786
because there was not
really an acknowledgement

1941
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:36,524
of the gay scene and the secrecy
surrounding his condition.

1942
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:38,559
That hit the town
like a tidal wave.

1943
01:26:39,893 --> 01:26:41,462
- This ended the Hollywood
myth right there.

1944
01:26:41,495 --> 01:26:44,332
That, that exposed it
as the lie that it was.

1945
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,867
And Hollywood was never
the same again after that.

1946
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:48,669
Things changed for Scotty.

1947
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,839
Scotty was devastated
by Rock's death.

1948
01:26:53,307 --> 01:26:56,744
He was aware that this was a
disease that was spreading.

1949
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:01,816
AIDS brought a whole
new layer of danger

1950
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,752
and risk to being
gay in Hollywood.

1951
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,490
- When AIDS came along,
I thought I'm gonna pass

1952
01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:12,293
on fixing people up
because I don't want to

1953
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:14,829
be involved in that.

1954
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,666
It's a case of, you just
hope you don't catch it.

1955
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:19,467
- [Matt] Luck.

1956
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,301
- [Scotty] Luck.

1957
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:21,434
That's right.

1958
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:22,568
That's exactly what it'd be.

1959
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:24,906
It'd have to be just luck,
just one of those things.

1960
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:27,342
- Honey?

1961
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:30,812
He shouldn't be up there.

1962
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:40,588
(dog barking)

1963
01:27:44,091 --> 01:27:45,760
What are you doing?

1964
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,695
- [Scotty] I'm gonna get over
to the ladder and get down.

1965
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:48,929
- [Lois] Oh, good.

1966
01:27:48,962 --> 01:27:51,365
- Jesus, when I think
of how I used to be able

1967
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:53,868
to maneuver around, now
I'm a fucking cripple.

1968
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:54,936
My goddamn arm.

1969
01:27:56,103 --> 01:27:57,872
- [Lois] You shouldn't
be doing this.

1970
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:58,773
- [Scotty] Wait a minute.

1971
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,075
(babbles)

1972
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:03,778
Fuck, what's the matter
with my goddamn legs now?

1973
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:06,847
Is it on the thing?

1974
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,382
- [Lois] Yeah.

1975
01:28:08,415 --> 01:28:09,617
(Scotty sighs)

1976
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:11,885
(ladder rattling)

1977
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:14,922
(slow somber music)

1978
01:28:21,628 --> 01:28:24,031
- Apparently, I had a little
bit of a kidney problem

1979
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,833
from taking Atabrine.

1980
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:28,636
Atabrine is for the
prevention of malaria.

1981
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,804
They found out later that

1982
01:28:32,606 --> 01:28:33,875
everybody that took that,

1983
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:38,579
it did damage to their kidneys.

1984
01:28:38,612 --> 01:28:40,081
- [Matt] You took
it during the war?

1985
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,781
- Took it for three years, yeah.

1986
01:28:41,815 --> 01:28:43,817
And I should never
have taken that shit.

1987
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:47,121
Reserved only for who?

1988
01:28:47,154 --> 01:28:48,789
- [Matt] Volunteer parking.

1989
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:49,890
- I'm a fucking volunteer.

1990
01:28:49,923 --> 01:28:51,125
Fuck it. (laughs)

1991
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:53,561
- They do ultrasound
every so often

1992
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:55,463
to check how the kidneys are.

1993
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:59,567
And obviously,
they're slowly going,

1994
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,671
'cause when it first started
it was only 25% loss.

1995
01:29:03,704 --> 01:29:05,072
You know, then they
said, maybe someday

1996
01:29:05,105 --> 01:29:07,942
we'll have to consider dialysis.

1997
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:08,976
And the last time he went

1998
01:29:09,009 --> 01:29:10,545
they said we have to do it.

1999
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:13,481
They wanna put the,

2000
01:29:15,015 --> 01:29:18,653
like a stent in
his arm and, soon.

2001
01:29:21,755 --> 01:29:24,892
I think he thinks he can
buy a kidney someplace.

2002
01:29:27,828 --> 01:29:29,997
- [Scotty] Lee,
how are you, baby?

2003
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,165
Huh?

2004
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:32,500
You sweetheart.

2005
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,370
(slow soft music)

2006
01:29:37,204 --> 01:29:38,840
- [Lee] Morning.

2007
01:29:44,111 --> 01:29:45,446
- You know, Lee and I said,

2008
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:46,981
to show you what a buddy is,

2009
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:49,049
Lee called me and said he
wants to give me a kidney.

2010
01:29:49,082 --> 01:29:50,484
(laughs)

2011
01:29:50,517 --> 01:29:51,519
Now is that a buddy?

2012
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:54,055
I said you're a real buddy.

2013
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:56,790
You're a real buddy, Lee.

2014
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:02,930
(garage door rattling)

2015
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:07,835
(slow soft piano music)

2016
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:12,906
I often think back of

2017
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:15,910
how nice things were.

2018
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:19,680
I can't think back of any bad
scenes or bad things at all.

2019
01:30:22,783 --> 01:30:25,853
And, and so many people
have said the nicest

2020
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:28,656
and best time of their whole
life was that gas station.

2021
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:35,196
And that's why I felt good that
I made so many people happy.

2022
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:37,598
(laughs)

2023
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:39,967
- [Female Reporter]
Team coverage,

2024
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,702
Jay Yamamoto is looking ahead

2025
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:42,835
for what is next
for gay couples.

2026
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,939
- [Male Reporter] The decision
from the Supreme Court

2027
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:48,075
now paves the way to historic
change here in California.

2028
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:50,678
- The Justices
dismissed Proposition 8

2029
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:54,081
and the news sent shockwaves
throughout Southern California.

2030
01:30:54,114 --> 01:30:57,218
(slow soft piano music)

2031
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:05,226
(people chattering)

2032
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:12,666
- I would say the timing
is just about right, now.

2033
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,070
And when I tell people the gas
station days were different,

2034
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,005
I mean they were
completely different.

2035
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,275
50 or 60 years ago, this
could have never happened,

2036
01:31:21,308 --> 01:31:22,810
you know that, impossible.

2037
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,717
- History evolves in
incremental steps,

2038
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:34,755
and Scotty really was
lighting a way forward

2039
01:31:35,622 --> 01:31:36,991
that we are now embracing

2040
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,760
where the motto is:
Do your own thing.

2041
01:31:39,793 --> 01:31:42,797
He was doing that when it
was not culturally accepted.

2042
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:44,932
- You want to wear
those clothes?

2043
01:31:44,965 --> 01:31:46,166
- No, I don't wanna
wear this thing,

2044
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:48,134
I just want to get married!

2045
01:31:48,168 --> 01:31:49,236
(dog barks)

2046
01:31:49,269 --> 01:31:51,805
- We were given a myth,

2047
01:31:51,838 --> 01:31:55,009
and it's important
to show the public

2048
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,778
that their heroes can be flawed,

2049
01:31:57,811 --> 01:31:59,179
or their heroes
can be complicated,

2050
01:31:59,212 --> 01:32:00,781
or their heroes can be gay.

2051
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:05,286
You know, Scotty holds a
mirror up to the culture

2052
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:09,223
to help people see the kind
of puritanical nature of,

2053
01:32:09,256 --> 01:32:12,760
not only the culture during
the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s,

2054
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:13,928
but even to this day.

2055
01:32:15,929 --> 01:32:18,098
- I think a mistake would
be to look at the story

2056
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:20,100
of Scotty's being a
story of a, you know,

2057
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:23,771
gay renegade in a gay
world, in a gay subculture.

2058
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,774
Because, Scotty was pre-gay.

2059
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:30,177
He, he himself doesn't conform
to any particular label.

2060
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:33,347
Scotty just breezes
across all the fences

2061
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:35,983
