十年荏苒 再次踏上那一成不变的山丘
Ten years gone, 'proaching that self-same hill.

3
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,020
我原以为会命丧此地
I thought to lay me down and rise no more.

4
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,230
离我远点儿 妖风要来了
Give me wide berth! That's just passed wind!

5
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,770
也可能只是个臭屁
Possibly worse.

6
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,860
在永远阖上双眼之前
Before eyes close for good and all...

7
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,070
我只想再见我的琼妮・斯塔布斯一次
I'd once again see my Joanie Stubbs...

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,150

卡拉米蒂・简对失去挚爱的遗憾

And, too, at the grave of Wild Bill.

11

Oof, I've a left-cheek ass blister's a percolating son of a bitch.

12

行 就放那
Good, right there.

怎么 你想跳舞吗
Why, you wanna dance?

24
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,270

What'd that be about?

25

用来做电话线杆
Fashioning into telephone poles.

26
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,900
还嫌我们这儿的电话线杆不够多吗
Ain't we got enough of them damn things already?

27
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,730
计划是要给每家铺面都接上电话线

不太舒服是吗 长官
Out of sorts, would you say, Commander?

一点小毛病 不足挂齿
Half a stride short of fully fit.

31
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,610
体重莫名减了几斤是吧
Light, somewhat, a few pounds.

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,980
脸色也有点苍白
And some bit pallid, too.

33
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,440
老天 医生 你还不如一枪崩了我

星期几之间有什么区别吗
The fuck difference does the day make?

36
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,150
劳烦您务必告诉我

把星期五记成星期二
Mistaking Friday for Tuesday.

40

先给我挖个坑吧

你的体温比正常要高两度

印堂发黑

43
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,650
面色发黄
flesh of a yellowish cast,

44
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,190
眼看就他妈的要病入膏肓了
Pending fucking developments...

45
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,230
你最好别沾酒了
I'd have you forbear from spirits.

46
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,320
-悉听尊便 -你别
- Under advisement. - Oh, no, no, no.

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,730
别跟我开玩笑 也别用这种轻蔑的语气
Don't you humor me, nor talk down to me neither,

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,570
也不要不请自来地到处鬼混
nor fix to mix in where you ain't been invited.

49
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,020
你怎么能这样说我
Whilst you comport the very like to me?

50
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,570
你的肝脏出了问题 艾尔
You went somewhat wrong at your liver, Al,

51
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,900
还是你自己一手造成的
is what you've God damn done!

52
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,440
酒保 你是睁眼瞎还是怎么的
Bar you being out-and-out blind,

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,110
你明知道他病了
you already know he's ill.

54
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,730
一分钟前
Minute past,

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,320
我还跟丹说呢 老大气色不好
words to Dan, "Boss is looking poorly.

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,770
看上去像是病了
Out of sorts."

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,400
他看上去像是没病吗 你这只蠢驴
Don't he look outta sorts, you goddamn donkey?

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,360
在他的诊断化验结果出来前
He is to forbear from spirits of any kind,

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
他什么酒都不能沾
until he's assayed and diagnosed.

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,230
要知道他完全可以去街上随便买酒喝
You know he'll just endeavor to import spirits in off the street?

61
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,020
那你就不准他喝啊
Well, you're not to allow it!

62
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,650
说来容易做来难啊
That's easier told than saddled and rode.

63
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,770
那你们就把他直接吊死啊 妈的
Well then, go ahead and hang him, goddamn it!

64
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,480
或者一枪崩了他
Blow his fuckin' head off!

65
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,900
这样大家都省事了
Save us all some time!

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,480
起床气有点重啊
Wrong side of the damn bed!

73
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,110
你是为了银行的事回来的吗
asking if it's banking brings you back these parts?

74
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,110
对 是银行的事
Banking, yes.

My interest in the Deadwood Bank,

76

77
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,230
埃尔斯沃斯夫人 这要放到几年前
Few years back, Mrs. Ellsworth,

78
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
会有人教那种无礼的家伙好好做人

The 10 years went past like--

83

00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,650
经由时间
the changes wrought

141
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,020
巧思和创新
by time,

142
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,690
所发生的日新月异的变化
ingenuity, and invention.

143
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,900
但无可否认的是
Though none would deny the facts

144
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,570
历史上所付出的代价
the cost of past,

145
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,400
由在场的各位所知晓的
we who gather have known together...

146
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,900
其中的一部分历史
Some portion of which must still

147
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,150
是用血的代价换来的
be measured in blood.

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,570
但朽木镇
Yet, the Deadwood community

149
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,150
已经日渐成熟
does enter its adulthood...

150
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,070
还真是振奋人心啊
And don't our spirits raise,

151
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,520
你个背后插刀 杀人放火
you murdering, conniving,

152
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,520
烧杀抢掠的狗东西
thieving cocksucker.

153
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,110
智谋与勇敢
Resourceful and resolute,

154
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,980
是新建的南达科他州的一重要部分
a vital part of the new-made state of South Dakota,

155
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,690
而本州
and this state

156
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,520
也是我们伟大祖国的一重要部分
a vital part of our fine country.

157
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,730
上天保佑
Amen to that!

158
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,570
谢谢您 议员
Thank you, Senator!

159
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,730
差两间房旅馆就客满了 崔西
Hotel's but two rooms short of fully occupied, Trixie,

160
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,480
游行还在如火如荼地进行
with the parade yet still in full swing.

161
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,980
恭喜你了 史达先生
Congratulations then, Mr. Star,

162
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,860
以及布洛克警长
to you and Marshal Bullock.

163
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,470
快用砖头给我脑袋来一下
Maybe mark the moment

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,440
好纪念这一刻
braining me with a fucking brick!

165
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,070
我得尽快娶你进门
I'd sooner put a ring on your finger.

166
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,650
那得先看这个孩子能不能活下来
Once first we've seen does the baby survive.

167
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,230
这就是你脑海里想结婚的唯一
That being, in your scripture, matrimony's single

168
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,110
理由和目的吗
reason and purpose.

169
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,570
我这个年纪的妓女能怀上孩子
Ain't we already awash in the miracle

170
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,480
不就已经是天大的奇迹了吗
of a whore of my vintage being pregnant at all?

171
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,900
那要不要穿的喜庆一点
Well, why not wear a sign, then?

172
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,820
像是从头到脚穿个大红袍
Dress in red, head to toe?

173
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,520
拜托了 崔西 你不该去外头露面
Please, Trixie. You oughtn't show your face outside.

174
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,980
我会吩咐人送来你喜欢的冰柠檬水
Lemonade's on its way with chips of ice, how you like.

175
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,610
休息一下
Rest now.

176
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,900
我感觉要挂了
I just got the fuck up.

177
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,480
好好休息吧
Rest.

178
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,320
亲妈爆炸的混账东西
Murdering motherless cocksucker.

179
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,520
赫斯特议员 尊敬的阁下
Oh, Senator Hearst! Your honor!

180
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,230
参议员 在他们被屠杀的十周年
On this 10th anniversary of them being butchered,

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,270
纪念日之际 我向你转达来自
I convey to you, Senator, memorial greetings

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,940
矿工埃尔斯沃斯和妓女珍的悼念问候
from the miner Ellsworth and prostitute Jen.

183
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,770
-但只有这两个人知道 -等等
- But two of the who knows how many - Hold it!

184
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,610
你为了赚钱做了多么肮脏的工作
you've done for while making your moneyed progress!

185
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,650
你难道不知道
Have I missed word of your appointment

186
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,610
新参议员的任命的消息吗
to some position of authority?

187
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,690
你问我知不知道你
Have I missed word of yours,

188
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,860
你个秃顶贱人
you bald-pated cunt?!

189
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,860
参议员 你最好小心点
Better watch yourself, Senator!

190
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,690
赫斯特先生
Mr. Hearst?

191
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,400
不是吗 先生
For ain't it so, sir.

192
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,820
当你在暗爽时
It's the thieving and throat-cutting,

193
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,730
他们被掠夺 被割喉
them's bloodied and dead in the mud,

194
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
浑身是血 烂在泥里
as still stiffens the member in your long-johns!

195
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,650
看在上帝的份儿上 他们为什么不走呢
Well, why not press forward, for Christ's sake?

196
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,150
等着她爆炸吗
Set herself aflame?

197
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,610
不 我不应该
Nor, ought I fail to remark

198
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,650
站在这个有利位置说道
the semblance from this vantage twixt

199
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,230
你的巧取豪夺的日子已经到头了
your very mug and a snatch has gone haired-over-sideways.

200
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,520
法纳姆镇长 这是
Mayor Farnum! It's a...

201
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,900
看来崔西并没有丢失她的天赋
Trixie hasn't lost her gift.

202
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,480
事实上她确实是
She ain't for a fact.

203
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,980
岁月都改变不了这一点
Time can't touch that.

204
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,320
让这个老狐狸
...letting this slimy cocksucker slither his way

205
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,150
在我们镇子里横行霸道
into our camp's inner workings!

206
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,900
你就是一个肮脏下流妓女
And aren't you the vile bodying

207
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,940
的卑鄙化身 快走
of a gutter-mouth trollop and tramp! Go.

208
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,730
-正如你是一个无耻的杀人犯 -走
- As you are of a murdering shitheel! - Now.

209
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,650
崔西
Trixie!

210
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,190
你没别的事儿干吗 崔西
What's left still to do, Trixie?

211
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,020
你想从楼梯上摔下去
Pitch yourself down the stairs?

212
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,650
然后断送我们孩子的幸福吗
End any chance of our child's well-being?

213
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,400
妈的
Jesus wept!

214
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,650
怎么了
What is it?

215
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,820
被你他妈的说中了 有点不对劲
Something amiss, as you fuckin' foresaw.

216
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,150
准备要生了吗
Ready for the doc we are?

217
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,440
-你快去找医生吧 -好
- Off you go then to fetch him. - Okay.

218
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,690
会没事的
I'll be good.

219
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,270
警长
Marshal!

220
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,110
乌特先生
Mr. Utter!

221
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,360
-你好 -你好 姑娘们
- Hello. - Hello, girls.

222
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,820
-查理叔叔向你们问好 -查理叔叔
- Greetings from Uncle Charlie. - Uncle Charlie!

223
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,610
很高兴再次见到你们俩
It's lovely to see you both again.

224
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,400
布洛克太太
Mrs. Bullock.

225
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,070
我记得你的阅读课上得很好
I remember your reading lessons so well.

226
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,480
埃尔斯沃斯太太和她的女儿
Mrs. Ellsworth here and her daughter,

227
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,570
需要一个房间
they need a room.

228
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,610
我告诉他们镇上最好的酒店就在那里
I told them best hotel in town's right there.

229
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,320
也许对酒店老板来说
Perhaps installing Mrs. Ellsworth in a suite

230
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,430
给埃尔斯沃斯太太安置一间套房
would be the considerate thing

231
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,110
是件挺体面的事儿
for the hotel's owner to do?

232
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,820
是的 当然
Yes, it would.

233
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,860
埃尔斯沃斯太太 你有订到房间吗
Mrs. Ellsworth, was there a room available?

234
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,980
呃 似乎
Uh, it-it seems...

235
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,400
我们得到了最后一个
we've secured the very last one.

236
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,270
看来今天是我的幸运日
Must be my lucky day.

237
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,190
我送你上楼
I'll walk you upstairs.

238
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,270
你一直以来都活在我的回忆中
You, having so lived in recollection,

239
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,770
警长
Marshal,

240
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,860
能再次见到你真是太高兴了
it is my considerable happiness to see you again.

241
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,480
埃尔斯沃斯太太 我比你见到我更高兴
No less a happiness, Mrs. Ellsworth, than of seeing you for me.

242
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,940
如同往日美梦再次苏醒
As a dream might come alive to draw a breath.

243
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,320
说得太多了
Said overmuch.

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,230
我发誓不会再来 但我知道我绝对会的
Vowed I wouldn't, but I absolutely knew I would.

245
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,820
你来之前为什么不写信告诉我
Why didn't you write of your arrival?

246
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,820
我没把握
Not sure.

247
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,230
我懂了
I see.

248
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,820
我想知道
I wonder,

249
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,440
布洛克先生
Mr. Bullock, if all

250
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,320
我的不速而来是否
unwitting...

251
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,400
给你带来了什么麻烦
I may have done something to upset an apple cart.

252
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,230
一点也不
Not at all.

253
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,820
很高兴再次见到你们俩
It's a pleasure to see you both again.

254
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,940
怎么了
What?

255
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,980
没什么 妈妈
Nothing, Mama.

256
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,520
布洛克 嘿 警长
Bullock! Hey, Marshal!

257
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,520
应该找个人来通知我
Just the man I was looking for, could warned me

258
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,440
埃尔斯沃斯太太的到来 查理
of Mrs. Ellsworth's return, Charlie.

259
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,320
妈的 别说你了 我都感到惊讶
How the fuck, when I was surprised myself?

260
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,230
至少不要把她安在我这该死的酒店里
Very least not deposit her in my goddamn hotel!

261
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,900
嘿 别说那些儿女情长的小事了
Hey, if you're finished rapping my knuckles,

262
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,770
我们谈些大老爷们的事
I got some more manly matters to discuss.

263
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,770
我洗耳恭听 查理
I'm all ears, Charlie.

264
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,690
赫斯特想买我的地
Hearst wants to buy my land.

265
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,480
先是让中介拿着钱袋在我面前晃荡
Dangling big paydays through third parties.

266
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,980
然后他今天会自己过来
He's coming today hisself.

267
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,730
-你准备接受吗 -我都这把年纪了
- Are you disposed? - My age, I'd...

268
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,020
要不接受的话那也太傻吧
be a fool not to chew on it some.

269
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,590
很明显 布洛克把眼睛挪开了
Which, uh, evidently, Bullock that looks away,

270
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,690
皱着眉头
scowling like he is,

271
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,520
好像并不赞成此事
don't approve of.

272
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,900
乌特的朋友布洛克这样想的
Utter's pal Bullock

273
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,770
如果乌特卖掉了他的土地
figures if Utter sold off his land,

274
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,520
那乌特除了坐在那间老酒馆里发呆
nothing for Utter to do but sit wondering,

275
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,150
别无他事可做 那他到底为什么
in that old saloon, why in hell

276
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,070
要卖掉他花了一辈子
he'd sold the thing he'd spent his life

277
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,480
才买来的 并为他所用的东西呢
getting situated to buy and keep to work it himself?

278
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,190
赫斯特不配拥有你的土地 查理
Hearst doesn't deserve your land, Charlie.

279
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,570
我也不应该忘记
Nor ought I either fail to bring to mind

280
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,440
那个混蛋有前科
the bastard's disposition to foul play.

281
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,610
谈判开始前
Before negotiations commence,

282
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,020
我想我亲自去拜访赫斯特会不会不合适?
would I be out of place calling on Hearst myself?

283
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,150
我也在想 你能给我弄一件尿不湿吗
I wonder, too, might you procure me an infant's linen?

284
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,480
你这样说话朋友都没得做了 查理
And you don't make a friend a stranger, Charlie.

285
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,230
把别人拒之门外
Decline him walking beside you.

286
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,110
先说 我很感激
Saying first, my being grateful

287
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,610
衷心感谢
and heartily appreciative,

288
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,270
我会帮你的朋友最好地
I'd hold with your friend best achieving

289
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,110
实现他自己的目的
his purposes toting his water himself.

290
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,690
今晚一起吃晚饭
Join us for dinner tonight.

291
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,650
你对我儿子从你耳朵里变硬币感到惊奇
You amaze my boy pulling coins from your ears.

292
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,020
要是赫斯特能从我的屁股上
Better trick would be me pulling

293
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,320
变出好几百个就好了
Hearst's hundreds out my ass.

294
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,730
7点等你 查理舅舅
Expect you 7:00, Uncle Charlie.

295
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,270
谢谢 布洛克
Thanks, Bullock,

296
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,980
走好
for the lookout.

297
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,650
早上好 新来的小姐
Good morning, Miss Newly-Arrived!

298
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,320
我猜你是这儿的老板吧
Might you be the establishment's operator?

299
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,320
请叫我艾尔
Named Al.

300
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,270
斯威伦根家最后一人
Swearengen's the remainder,

301
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,940
如果你不觉得这名字
if you ain't overmuch gave pause

302
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,440
太拗口的话
to the various ins and outs.

303
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,360
可以叫我卡罗琳 斯威伦根先生
My name's Caroline Woolgarden, Mr. Swearengen,

304
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,480
我想这不会比你的名字
which I imagine don't slide easy off the tongue

305
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,110
更易脱口而出
any more than yours does.

306
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,400
卡罗琳・乌尔哥登 溜得像黄油
Caroline Woolgarden, like butter.

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,980
初来乍到 希望能租到一间舒适的房间
Come new to town in hope of renting one of your fine rooms.

308
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,070
有白痴来了
Shitbird in prospect.

309
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,770
失陪了 乌尔哥登小姐
Would you excuse me, Miss Woolgarden?

310
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,110
真是稀客啊
Ah, produce

311
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,860
乔治・赫斯特先生
George Hearst Esquire,

312
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,980
来自加州的商业巨子 初级参议员
colossus of commerce, junior senator from California,

313
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,570
看来自我们上次邂逅以来
who since our paths last crossed

314
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,730
你变得越来越有权势了
has went from strength to stronger strength still.

315
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,690
就像你说的那样
Even as you name me,

316
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,570
我在这里也算是一个人物 斯威伦根先生
a figure to be reckoned with in this camp, Mr. Swearengen,

317
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,900
今天早晨
I have been made this morning,

318
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,070
我在某种程度上
more than somewhat,

319
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,400
有点不太舒服
to look an incompetent.

320
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,980
你吗 先生
You, sir?

321
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,070
不舒服吗 怎么会这样
An incompetent? Now, how would that ever be?

322
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,940
许多年过去了 我想让你再重温一下
These years now past, I'd have you recall

323
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,570
当年我被袭击的那件事
my having been attacked.

324
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,190
枪袭
Shot,

325
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,520
似乎是一个妓女干的
and near as not, done in by a whore,

326
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,110
之前我知道她的名字
whose name, if I ever knew it,

327
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,610
但现在却已经不记清了
has now been lost to me.

328
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,020
我隐约记得那件事
I dimly recall the matter.

329
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,440
不知民的妓女开始了复仇计划
The nameless whore embarked on a program of vengeance,

330
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,940
而且 天哪 她差点就成功了
and, by God, she nearly brought off.

331
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,440
重点是她企图谋杀我
Referring to her attempt to murder me.

332
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,360
画面不难想象
Not to pretty the picture.

333
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,320
我一直相信
I have lived

334
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,770
这件事已经解决了
believing the matter had been settled.

335
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,020
而且对此我深信不疑
And I was satisfied in that belief.

336
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,770
但现在 我意识到我被耍了
But now, I realize I was tricked.

337
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,860
躺在棺材里的那个妓女根本不是那位枪手
The whore you presented in the box was not the shooter at all.

338
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,980
参议员 您可真是异想天开啊
Ah, you're going for the long, larger-minded view, Senator.

339
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,150
这基于线人给我的信息
Which depends on running telephone lines across the claims.

340
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,070
若能认识到共进之处
On recognizing common ground,

341
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,900
才能一起面向未来
bringing the future to it.

342
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,980
简要来说
A brief illustration of my point--

343
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,070
先生 你说话有简短吗
Does brevity exist in your repertoire, sir?

344
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,610
我正在向查理・乌特的土地出价
I am making an offer on Charlie Utter's land.

345
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,110
木材今天早上就已经到了
Lumber for construction arrived this morning.

346
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,770
很自信嘛
Confident, are we?

347
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,610
支持我收购乌特的不动产
Back my bid for buying up Utter's property.

348
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,440
利用你在镇上的地位来影响其他人
Use your position in the town to sway others,

349
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,070
我就不再追究妓女的事儿
and I will drop any counteraction against the whore.

350
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,440
那个袭击我的怀孕妓女
The pregnant whore who attacked me.

351
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,110
够直截了当的 先生
Uncharacteristically straightforward, sir.

352
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,320
发掘你内心深处的本性
Discover your deepest nature,

353
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
斯威伦根先生
Mr. Swearengen.

354
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,360
与未来同行
Walk with the future.

355
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,650
你还好吧 艾尔
How'd that do you, Al?

356
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,190
看起来不错吧
Good like it seemed?

357
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,860
现在是管管崔西的好机会
Best time to produce Trixie

358
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,610
让她闭上嘴 好给我脸上贴点金
so I can sell her on silence as virtue.

359
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,440
明白 老板
On it, Boss.

360
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,270
就是这样 用力呼气 呼出来
That's it. Blow it out, just blow it out.

361
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,650
约瑟夫 《圣经》中希伯来人部落的祖先
基督 耶稣 圣母玛利亚 约瑟夫
Christ, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

362
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,770
他们已经排着队在支持你了 崔西女士
They're arrayed to support you, Ms. Trixie,

363
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,730
但你才是应该使劲的人
but you're the one who's got to be pushing!

364
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,520
苍天啊 我看上去没在使劲吗 卢阿姨
Which don't I, in Christ, look to be doing, Aunt Lou?

365
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,150
我是丹・多里特
Dan Dority!

366
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,230
艾尔想和崔西谈话
Speaking for Al that needs words with Trixie!

367
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
崔西现在没空
Trixie ain't receiving,

368
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,820
回家都很难 请你
hard as she's coming for home. If you'd just

369
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,320
告诉艾尔 我们会找他谈
tell Al, we'll issue word...

370
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,650
-加油 使劲 -别在这个节骨眼上
- Come on, come on. - ...from this quarter

371
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,610
等我们有体力有时间了再说
as we are fucking able!

372
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,070
好的 我听清楚了 医生
Okay. I hear you, Doc.

373
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,940
再使劲一下 崔西
One more push, Trixie.

374
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,940
就是这样
This is it.

375
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,570
-现在我们要再做一件事 -然后
- Now, we doing something. - And...

376
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,610
我们在做啦
Now we doing it.

377
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,270
好了
Okay.

378
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,190
看到他下面了吗
See his business?

379
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,520
是个男孩
You got a boy!

380
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,690
是男孩
A boy.

381
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,820
抱着他
Go ahead,

382
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,400
拍一下他的后背
and slap his backside.

383
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,190
好了
There we go.

384
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,900
崔西
Oh, Trixie.

385
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,320
你好啊 约书亚
Hello, Joshua.

386
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,190
上帝会保佑你的
Lord keep you.

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,110
灾星简・康娜妮女士
Ms. Calamity Jane Cannary.

388
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,770
是查理・乌特老先生啊
Charlie Utter.

389
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,190
把你塞进箱子再送上火车可难度不小啊
Some putting odds up train bring you home in a box.

390
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,020
我是来接琼妮・斯塔布斯的
I come to collect Joanie Stubbs.

391
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,570
天啊
Oh, God.

392
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,980
你怎么看斯塔布斯女士的情况
How would you, uh, describe the Stubbs woman's state of affairs?

393
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,650
不同于她所坚持的 我
Not seeing her consistent, I...

394
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,400
我认为琼妮・斯塔布斯沮丧忧郁的情绪
I say Joanie Stubbs' collecting her portion of

395
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,320
越来越重 就像这里的每个人一样
gloom and dismay, just like any of us.

396
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,900
那么
Well, suppo--

397
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,980
查理假如
Suppose, Charlie...

398
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,570
在这种情况下某个人有点性志
say a, a person had a interest in that situation,

399
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,980
在你看来 要怎么提这个比较尴尬
what, by your lights, would be a right way

400
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,570
的话题才比较好呢
of broaching the subject?

401
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,110
我可能会说
I'd maybe say...

402
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,690
你在为她考虑
you been thinking of her,

403
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,610
希望
hoping...

404
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,270
若她也为你考虑的话
if ever she thought of you,

405
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,440
也同样会是这样想的
her thinking would be friendly, too.

406
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,440
把你刚刚说的一字不落写下来 老混蛋
Write me that down to repeat it, you cocksucker.

407
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,190
你是懂得该怎么说  简
You know what to say, Jane.

408
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,690
你也知道该怎么做
What to do.

409
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,610
请你喝酒
I will stand you to a drink.

410
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,820
感情深一口闷
Down it along with you, too, far as that goes.

411
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,110
-就一口 -喝个屁的酒
- One drink. -Fuck one drink.

412
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,270
快找你姑娘去
Go find your girl.

413
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,940
快去找她
Go get her.

414
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,610
贝拉工会

415
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,610
乔安妮・
斯塔布斯

416
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,150
我得找人谈谈
I'd have a word,

417
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,270
和你们管事的也好
either with management,

418
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,900
或者哪个愿意面朝我的姑娘也好
or just some girl ain't on her back just now,

419
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,480
翘着脚的也行
legs straight up in the air!

420
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,150
如果你要找老板
If you want the boss,

421
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,980
乔安妮在楼上
Joanie's upstairs.

422
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,820
她忙吗
Busy?

423
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,980
-我不知道 -不 我们不知道
- I didn't see. - No, we didn't see.

424
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,110
斯塔布斯小姐 我是简・康娜妮
Jane Cannary come a-calling, Miss Stubbs.

425
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,980
您不赶我走的话我会十分感激
I'd be grateful if you'd hold your fire.

426
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,400
每个人都有挺大的空间嘛
Everyone got plenty of room?

427
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,770
好像也还凑合
Seem to be making due.

428
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,570
我和狄妮先出去了 乔安妮
Why don't me and Deenie just get outta here, Joanie?

429
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,900
我们可不想惹麻烦
We don't want no trouble.

430
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,610
来得好啊 简
Well arrived, Jane.

431
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,480
-欢迎回家 - 去你妈的
- Welcome home. - Go fuck yourself.

432
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,230
拿好她的香皂
Hold her soap!

433
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,150
好久不见
Considerable time since seeing you.

434
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,230
我这不是去周游国家 环游世界了嘛
Wasn't me setting off see the country, see the world.

435
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,320
我们确实回不到过去了吗
Weren't we sure as fuck done with each other back then?

436
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,570
我可没这么说过
Not on none of my say-so.

437
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,730
说吧 你想说什么
Well, go on. Say what you wanna say.

438
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,150
就是
Uh, just...

439
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,110
看到你回来了非常高兴
surprised to find you back here is all.

440
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,400
我非常感谢
I'd be grateful

441
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,520
你一直关注着
keeping opinions to yourself concerning

442
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,520
我的行踪和所在地
my whereabouts and purposes.

443
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,820
你想吵架的话就吵吧
You wanna brawl, we can do it.

444
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,610
像我这么大的人了 吵架不太合适
Brawling's unseemly, girl my age.

445
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,270
查理・乌特说你变得越来越好了
Charlie Utter said you been better.

446
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,820
是吗 查理真的这么说吗
Is that right? Charlie did?

447
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,020
我猜你不得不在吸嗨了后
High on dope, as I suppose you'd have to be,

448
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,820
来陪那些可怜虫
consorting with them miserable cunts.

449
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,020
新旧讨厌鬼都有
New old damn shooter coming out.

450
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,320
她深信当她离开了桌子 游戏就结束了
Believed the game shut down when she left the table.

451
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,480
乌特先生 你的这些砂矿地
These placer acres that you own, Mr. Utter,

452
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,820
深深吸引着我
captured my attention.

453
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,190
你是在找你之前派出的侦察兵吧
Scouts you sent previous made that clear.

454
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,940
一个我所尊敬其判断能力的人
People whose judgment I respect

455
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,270
分析这片财产的市场价
assay this property's market value

456
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,520
为3500美金
at $3,500.

457
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,690
似乎就我在前进道路上孤独地坚持着
Seems I'm the lone holdout on the path of progress.

458
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,610
为了些好报
By way of abbreviating our back and forth and...

459
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,190
我们就不一来一回地讨价还价吧
maybe generating some good will,

460
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,900
我再加500美元
I'd go 500 above.

461
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,900
给你
Offer you...

462
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,730
整整4000美元现金
4,000 even, cash money.

463
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,900
我父亲曾经教我
My father taught his boy,

464
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,070
用"猛抓狠打"描述可能会更准确
uh, "beat hell into him" might maybe be more accurate,

465
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,770
如果
how if, uh,

466
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,520
你所投资的土地正在崛起
early enough on,

467
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,900
你又开始得足够早的话
you credited the settlements was coming,

468
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,150
可以先用合理的价格买下它
bought acres reasonable,

469
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,070
适当地开发
developed 'em sensible,

470
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,900
牢牢守住 等待时机
hung onto 'em until the market come right,

471
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,900
有一天你会发现
of a day you might could wake up and find

472
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,190
你做了一个非常满意的投资
you made yourself a respectable investment.

473
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,570
你父亲思想很先进啊
Forward thinking was your father then.

474
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,900
而现在 他的儿子在证实他的预言
And now, here's his boy to confirm his papa's prediction.

475
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,110
恰恰相反
Contrary-wise,

476
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
人可能会
man might could...

477
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,940
有一些特殊的情感
come to certain special feelings.

478
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,070
像是一部分
Partial, say,

479
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,320
对一片土地的情感
to a piece of ground.

480
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,690
看着一条河
A river...

481
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,190
就这样从森林中蜿蜒流过
bending through the forest like so.

482
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,650
我拒绝你的买卖 赫斯特先生
I decline your offer, Mr. Hearst,

483
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,020
谢谢你花时间和精力
thanking you for your time

484
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,110
来听我讲故事
and attention.

485
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,820
我多年的经验告诉我
My experience over time has come to be...

486
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,070
该开始谈判了
customarily, I am he who starts a negotiation.

487
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,860
你那些故事和名字也可以结束了
Names its finish, too.

488
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,070
也许今天早上
Maybe getting mother-fucked this morning

489
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,270
一个女人在大道上卖东西
in the thoroughfare, by a woman in the bargain,

490
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,480
而其中有样东西吸引了你回头去看
has somewhat got your back up.

491
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,270
而你就做作地在回头路上
Not the accolade you'd looked for

492
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,480
寻求你那该死的赞美
out your return to fuckin' camp.

493
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,690
先生 评价别人
Proffering that assessment, sir,

494
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,860
不是你职责所在
is hardly your proper bailiwick.

495
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,690
目前来说 我他妈就这么做了
Far as that, I went and proffered it any-fuckin'-way.

496
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,480
在场有没有人
Any soul on the grounds

497
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,940
和海象极其相似
bearing mortal likeness to a walrus,

498
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,070
举起你的右手或吹个口哨
raise up your right hand or whistle.

499
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,940
你 汤姆・纳托尔
You, Tom Nuttall!

500
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,570
把你的右手举起来
Up with your right,

501
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,150
或撅起你的嘴吹口哨
or purse your damn lips and blow!

502
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,610
别白费力气了
Pitiful effort.

503
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,520
欢迎回家 简
Welcome home, Jane.

504
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,190
只是因为某件事
'Scription to propose.

505
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,690
墓碑直立在棺材上
Tombstone above a casket.

506
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,770
就在这个点
"On this spot...

507
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,570
这里坐着比尔・希科克
"Was Bill Hickok

508
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,270
他被粗暴地毙命
"foully slayed,

509
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,610
就一个小子弹就打爆了他的头
"brains blown to bits...

510
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,440
是懦夫杰克・麦考尔动的手
"by the coward Jack McCall!

511
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,900
都沉睡在这底下
"'Neath this building, too,

512
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,480
往后
"days to come,

513
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,770
这重任就要寄托在
"will rest the remains of

514
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,610
简・阿迪斯・康娜妮的身上了
"Jane Ardis Cannary,

515
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,730
不认识我的人只知道我乃灾星
"known as Calamity to strangers,

516
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,650
但对比尔・希科克来说
"and to Bill Hickok

517
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,070
我却是他的知心朋友
"as a very good friend.

518
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,730
在这个
"At the place

519
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,860
他痛苦逝去的地方
"of his sorrowful demise,

520
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,110
愿我的灵魂能在这小心守望
"may Jane's spirit stand vigilante watch

521
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,110
好像在人生中看到了自己的无能
as in life she found herself unable."

522
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,980
说直白点 简
And to speak straightforward, Jane,

523
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,020
你就打算在这定居了
you mortally installed

524
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,020
还要烂在这里
and decaying 'neath this building

525
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,820
而不是给我留下贸易大亨的印象
don't strike me as a magnet for commerce.

526
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,480
因为你不会做生意啊 汤姆
Because you're headless for business, Tom,

527
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,690
然后一不小心 脸都耷拉到靴子上了
and heedless and horse-faced to boot!

528
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,360
为什么不把墓地清一清
Well, why not empty the graveyards?

529
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,860
我们可以把尸体摆在桌子上
We'll spot corpses at the tables,

530
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,400
营造一种阴郁的氛围
needling the gloom overall.

531
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,690
想想都是一股腐臭的味道
That's a rotten idea.

532
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,360
神经病 阿迪
Fuck yourself, Arty.

533
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,980
你在卖什么 吴
What are you selling, Wu?

534
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,150
斯韦德
Swedgin.

535
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,570

他有药要给你
He has medicine for you.

537
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,820
你脸色不太好
Your color looks wrong.

538
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,320
孟尧 可以雇你跑一趟吗
Mengyao, you for hire?

539
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,020
是的 斯韦德先生
Yes, Mr. Swedgin.

540
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,900
那好
Good.

541
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,320
我要你
I want you to

542
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,400
把这个纸条
take this note

543
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,730
拿给索尔・史达 让他转交给崔西女士
to Sol Star to give to his lady, Trixie,

544
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,400
就在那边的路上的
over at the Bullock Star Hotel

545
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,320
布洛克 史达旅馆里
over the road there.

546
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,230
-懂了吗 -我的酬劳是多少
- You got that? - How much will you pay me?

547
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,690
酬劳等你回来
Payment upon return,

548
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,190
确认完成工作后再给
and job verified complete.

549
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,110
你先到门外等你爷爷
Now go wait outside the door for your granddad.

550
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,170
去等着
wait.

551
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,150
斯韦德 喝 茶
Swedgin. Drink. Tea.

552
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,860
你 喝 茶
You drink tea.

553
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,480
不 不
No! No!

554
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,110
这个不 让我想割掉你的喉咙
I'll cut your chink throat for a "no,"

555
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,480
再把你和门外那个一起扔下阳台
and pitch you off the balcony with the other one,

556
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,270
掉下去的时候记得把舌头捋直
seek health advice on the way down.

557
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,650
去你妈的姓吴的
Fuckin' Wu.

558
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,230
出去 回该死的小地方去
Go on, get back to your fuckin' alley!

559
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
去你妈的茶
Fuckin' tea, huh?

560
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,110
我做错什么了吗
Am I doing somethin' wrong?

561
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,190
你让我很为难 你
You gimme the fantods, you're so...

562
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,690
之前在这工作的时候多么讨人喜欢
favoring a girl who once worked here.

563
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,270
她也像我这样穿长袜吗
Is she thick through the calf like me?

564
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,610
她很漂亮
She's pretty.

565
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,270
她有最亮的秀发 最甜的笑容
She had the yellowest hair. Just the sweetest damn smile.

566
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,520
还掉了一颗牙 就在
She had a chip, she had...

567
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,940
那儿 对在那儿 简直让人神魂颠倒
there, right there, like to drive a fella crazy.

568
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,770
至少让我是这样
Me at least, anyway.

569
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,520
珍
Jen...

570
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,770
是她的名字
her name was.

571
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,650
珍走了吗
And Jen move along?

572
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,150
是 她走了
She, she did. Uh-huh.

573
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,980
她走了
Moved on.

574
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,650
告诉你去哪了吗
Give you word where?

575
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,980
我之前没说实话 卡罗琳
I weren't telling you true, Caroline.

576
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,230
她去世了
She died.

577
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,400
珍死了
Jen did.

578
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,190
这很不幸
Just poor luck...

579
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,610
她明明什么都没做
Caught in the middle of situation none of her

580
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,070
却被迫拉入困境
fuckin' doing.

581
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,150
如此甜美的灵魂
"Exceptional sweet soul,"

582
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,690
牧师这样评价她
Minister said.

583
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,020
但他没有错
And he weren't wrong.

584
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,480
直到你放下她之前
Appears my job's in progress

585
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,020
似乎我都有工作可做了
before we might even get to set down.

586
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,320
过早的勃起…
Early uprising...

587
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,360
对我来说是漫长的考验
longtime trial to me.

588
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,610
查理迟到了一个多小时
More than an hour late is Charlie.

589
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,900
也许我因赫斯特对他太苛刻了
Maybe I pressed too hard about Hearst.

590
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,270
也许他还在和其他人聊天
Perhaps he got involved catching' up with folks.

591
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,190
我要给孩子们弄吃的了
I should feed the children.

592
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,400
我出去找一下查理
I'm gonna look out for Charlie.

593
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,480
晚上好 警长
Evening, Marshal!

594
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,360
简 看到查理・乌特了吗
Looking for Charlie Utter, Jane.

595
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,360
今晚我没有见到他
I ain't seen him tonight.

596
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,190
帮我个忙
Do something for me?

597
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,020
麻烦在镇上看看 如果找到查理
Check around town. If you find Charlie,

598
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,320
转告他 我妻子对他的行为很生气
tell him my wife's angry at his bad behavior.

599
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,820
- 没问题 - 哈利 和我一起
- Count on it! - Harry, with me.

600
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,690
我痛风得厉害
My gout's agitating.

601
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,770
-我可以带一个年轻人去吗 -可以
- Should I take one of the young ones? - Yes, sir.

602
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,980
我他妈会跟你去 布洛克
I'll fucking go with you, Bullock.

603
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,520
不 不
No! No!

604
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,610
我起来了 我起来了
I'm up! I'm up.

605
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,270
那是查理的马
That's Charlie's horse.

606
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,980
从那里开始找吧
Start over there.

607
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,650
保持警惕
Careful now!

608
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,070
你站这多久了
How long you standing out here?

609
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,900
感觉像是我操蛋的生活中美好的一部分
Better part of my fuckin' life, feels like.

610
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,730
你要和我一起找查理・乌特
You looking for Charlie Utter with me or not?

611
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,650
他有时候会到新的地方玩牌
He sometimes plays cards at this new place.

612
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,110
就因为我曾嘲笑过他
Only knowed that 'cause I teased him

613
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,320
他就不常在这出现了
never frequentin' this joint.

614
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,570
带路吧
Lead the way then.

615
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,520
查理
Charlie?

616
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,400
查理・乌特
Charlie Utter!

617
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,690
查理
Charlie!

618
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,570
出来 把手举到我能看到的地方
Come out, hands where I can see 'em.

619
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,270
别开枪
Don't you shoot.

620
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,570
你在这做什么 萨缪尔
What are you doing out here, Samuel?

621
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,610
我只是在拿我的鱼竿
I'm just reaching for my fishing pole,

622
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,400
请你们不要杀了我
and I'm askin' you not to kill me.

623
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,610
上帝啊 查理
Christ. Charlie!

624
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,400
不是我 先生
It weren't me, no sir!

625
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,480
你他妈在说什么
What the fuck you talkin' about?

626
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,110
布洛克呀
Bullock!

627
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,570
全能的耶稣啊
Jesus God in Heaven.

628
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,610
哈利 给他盖上毯子
Get him a blanket, Harry.

629
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,610
-不是我做的 警长 -别动
- I didn't do it, Marshal - Be still.

630
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,190
希望赫斯特先生会知道
I'd appreciate Mr. Hearst knowing

631
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,070
我在这等着和他谈谈
I'm waitin' to talk to him.

632
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,440
-那是乌特先生 -这不可能
- Mr. Utter! - That can't be!

633
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,190
你们看到了吗 浑身是血
You see? Covered in blood!

634
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,520
赫斯特先生 查理・乌特死了
Charlie Utter's dead, Mr. Hearst.

635
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,860
被人谋杀
Murdered.

636
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,520
警长 你知道 乌特先生死于谁手吗
Do we know by whose hand, Marshal, Mr. Utter has been taken?

637
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,940
谁开的枪
Who pulled the trigger,

638
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,400
把肮脏的钱拿出来就完事了
put the fucking money up to get it done.

639
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,940
先生 你这是诽谤
I take that, sir, as a slur

640
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,980
就为了激怒我
meant to incite me.

641
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,110
我不会让你得逞的
And I do not choose to be provoked.

642
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:15,000
先生 你预判乌特先生的死与我有关
Your imputing foreknowledge, sir, to me of Mr. Utter's murder

643
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:20,110
我不想接受这可耻的诋毁
exposes me to shameful slander and disesteem.

644
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,360
我请你收回你的观点
I will have you recant.

645
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,650
不然就准备好
Or either ready to receive

646
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,110
接受我的指责
behavior from me in rebuke.

647
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:37,400
你会如何指责我呢
What form then do you figure your rebuke will take,

648
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,190
难道也是像你之前杀妓女一样
murdering cunt that you are?

649
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,940
-布洛克 -我一会再去找你
- Bullock. - I'll get to you in a fuckin' minute.

650
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,650
查理・乌特呀
Charlie Utter.

651
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,440
请为这个好人的死而哀悼
Have a thought for a good man dead.

652
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,610
关门了 酒馆要关门了
Shut the place down. Bar's closed!

653
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,690
都他妈的从这滚出去
Go on, get the fuck outta here!

654
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,650
我要学着在你和该死的赫斯特
I'd learn the import of that look

655
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,610
之间做做样子
passed twixt you and fuckin' Hearst.

656
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,400
给警长拿杯威士忌
Get the marshal a whiskey.

657
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,020
我他妈什么都不想喝
I don't want a fuckin' drink.

658
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,860
所以 布洛克
Say, Bullock,

659
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,020
这家伙没用多少时间处理他的应尽事务
a fella, not many hours left to order his affairs,

660
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,520
而是花在了其他事情上
applied them that remained, naming such

661
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,860
还美其名曰需要优先处理
purposes that he'd give primacy.

662
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,190
不管你答不答应 艾尔
Deal me in or don't, Al.

663
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:54,150
我他妈才不会半途而废
I'd not be fucked halfway up.

664
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,860
赫斯特来过 假装大发慈悲
Hearst stopped by, wanted to bury the hatchet.

665
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,320
想用用少得可怜的钱和影响力
Pool revenue and influence

666
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,480
来换崔西的命
in exchange for Trixie's life.

667
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,900
他计划在乌特的地产上铺电话线
Planning to run telephone wires across Utter's property.

668
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,820
木材都要按他的要求摆
Lumber lies at his claim.

669
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,820
他把这些告诉你时 你他妈的怎么说
Him conveying that to you, you said fuckin' what?

670
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,650
-我同意了 -结果呢
- I let the offer sit. - To what fucking end?

671
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,150
布洛克 你说话可以委婉一点吗
You ever think, Bullock, of not going straight at a thing?

672
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,230
不能
No.

673
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,320
接下来呢 艾尔
What's the move, Al?

674
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,190
我真希望我他妈的知道
Wish the fuck I knew.

675
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,820
杀了查理・乌特就改变了游戏规则
Killing Charlie Utter changes the game.

676
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,190
有个目击证人可以作证
Say the man has an eyewitness to bring to bear.

677
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,690
他叫什么名字
Name him.

678
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,110
萨缪尔・费尔德
Samuel Fields.

679
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,900
这位黑鬼将军能作什么证
The Nigger General was an eyewitness to what?

680
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,820
为查理・乌特作证
Eyewitness to them as did for Charlie Utter.

681
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,610
因此我们需要一场他妈的完美的谋杀
And thereby need a good fuckin' murdering.

682
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,610
我们必须守法
Sidestepping legal administration.

683
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,440
如果连赫斯特都不遵守法律
Well, if it ain't for Hearst to follow the law,

684
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,400
你他妈还遵守个鬼
why the fuck should it be for you?

685
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,190
布洛克 你脸上这幅鬼表情是什么意思
Now, how should I construe that look on your mug, Bullock?

686
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,690
艾尔 我的职责不是遵守法律
My job ain't to follow the law, Al.

687
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,150
而是先理解法律
My job is to interpret it,

688
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,440
再依法行事
then enforce it... accordingly.

689
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,520
你最好规劝一下你的伙伴
You best counsel your partner proper,

690
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,770
确保其母亲和孩子的安全
the safety of mother and child.

691
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,320
索尔和我会负责的
Sol and me'll see to it.

692
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,820
赫斯特很快就会
Hearst won't take long

693
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,230
暴露他那恶心腐败的本性
before he honors the rigors of his putrid fuckin' nature.

694
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,570
他会遭报应的
He'll want an answer.

695
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,690
我帮你会转告的
I'll deliver your fuckin' answer.

696
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,020
电话在我的房间里
Fuckin' telephone in my joint.

697
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,520
酒馆是一个避难所
Saloon is a sanctuary.

698
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,020
每个人都配拥有
Every man worth the name

699
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,020
识而不得的价值
knows the value of being unreachable.

700
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,320
斯威伦根先生 请允许我现在服侍你
Will you have me suck your prick now, Mr. Swearengen?

701
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,610
我拒绝你之后你会改变心意吗
What has changed since early when I declined the offer?

702
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,400
我看起来像是会马上变得金枪不倒吗
Do I look suddenly robust, unimpededly erect?

703
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
我告诉过你 我不行了
I am out, as I told you,

704
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,270
应酬 活动 啥都不行了
of sorts, commission, activity.

705
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,900
甚至越来越记不住所有
And more and more forgetful what the whole

706
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,650
明示了的下流污秽的事
sordid fuckin' business is to signify.

707
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,070
我不介意被忘记
Plenty I wouldn't mind forgetting.

708
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,820
过来这里 过来
Hey, come over here. Come on.

709
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,980
之前你弄掉了这个
You dropped this earlier.

710
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,190
不管你信不信 我很看重它
Real or not, I value it high.

711
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:37,940
这可是个珍贵的纪念金币
That is a goddamn gold commemorative

712
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,360
值12到14美元
worth 12 to $14.

713
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,440
你能告诉我今天早上
Can I ask who the woman was earlier today,

714
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,230
在酒店阳台上大叫的女人是谁吗
yelling from the hotel balcony?

715
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,360
一个不怕死的人
One who ain't afraid to die.

716
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,770
你还看到谁了
And who you'd see live?

717
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,110
这就是问题所在
Well, that's the question.

718
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:57,730
我走了之后 谁来保护她
When I'm gone, who'll protect her?

719
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,190
上帝能有求必应吗 布洛克能吗
Can the Jew do what needs to be done? Can Bullock?

720
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,230
上帝 救救我
Oh Christ, save me.

721
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,730
我对她有感觉吗
Have I feelings for her?

722
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,400
难道我在这年纪失去了一个心爱的女人吗
Am I that fuckin' lost a cunt, a man my age?

723
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,690
令我伤感的是
Makes me wanna weep,

724
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,690
你让我想起了我父亲
how you remind me of my dad.

725
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,400
不要把你莫名的关系缠在我脖子上
Don't you hang your relations around my neck.

726
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,900
这是一个悲伤的夜晚
It's a sad night.

727
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,440
有什么烧着 了
Something's afire.

728
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,900
上帝
Christ.

729
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,230
我确实有感觉
I do have feelings.

730
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,020
敬查理・乌特
Charlie Utter.

731
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,070
把崔西捉拿归案可费了不少劲儿啊
So much to rounding up Trixie for me.

732
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,190
昨晚不是你让小吴回避一下嘛
Well last night, you sent little Wu with a notion to abstain!

733
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,690
是吗
Did I now?

734
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,730
医生并不是百分百赞成
Doc is not 100% all the way to the top persuaded

735
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,360
你现在就起床
that you oughta be up and about just yet.

736
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,230
医生有啥建议他爱咋咋地
Doc's got a call to his own fuckin' opinion,

737
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,650
但不要他妈的
but not to be blabbin'

738
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,770
对我的计划
about what pertains or ain't

739
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,070
指手画脚
to my fuckin' plans, huh?!

740
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,610
真他妈的操透了心
Fucking drenched.

741
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,900
艾尔 你起来干什么
What are you doing up, Al?!

742
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,020
这医生真他妈闲得蛋疼
Well, this is fucking pain in the balls.

743
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,730
老天
Jesus Christ!

744
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,570
我欠查理一次送行 医生
I owe Charlie Utter a sending off, Doc.

745
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,520
该死 艾尔
Oh, goddamn it, Al.

746
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,020
丹
Hey, Dan!

747
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,480
你做到了 不是吗
You do it, huh?

748
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
我们每人掬一把泥土给他吧
Handful of dirt from each of us?

749
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,320
敬查理・乌特
Charlie Utter.

750
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,480
? 你该独自 ?
? You gotta walk it ?

751
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:05,320
? 离去了 ?
? by yourself ?

752
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,020
? 旁无一人相伴 ?
? There's nobody else... ?

753
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,150
乌特先生习惯性地让我穿过他的地盘
Mr. Utter's accustomed to letting me cross

754
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,730
并在分隔他的和赫斯特先生
his land and fish the stream

755
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,520
的土地的小溪里钓鱼
that separates his acres from Mr. Hearst.

756
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,210
我到那里后大概过了15分钟
He come 'round about a quarter

757
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,690
他正好路过
past the second I caught,

758
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,480
我还想着他可能会
me expecting his purpose to

759
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,940
问候我最近怎么样
ask how I was faring.

760
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,940
我听到一声枪响 然后立马就跑了
I heard a rifle shot, and took the fuck off.

761
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,480
你能认出是谁开的枪吗
Could you identify the man who did it?

762
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,070
不 先生 我不能
No, sir, I cannot.

763
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,230
因为我根本没看见他
Because I didn't see him.

764
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,980
你说的是实话吗
You being you?

765
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,860
是的 我的肤色不会改变事实
Me being the color I am, yes, sir.

766
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,320
不过我希望我能
I wish I could.

767
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,900
我再和你说一次 警长
I'ma say this once to you, Marshal.

768
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,690
我会让自己仍抱有希望
I'm gonna let myself hope

769
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,270
关于你不会允许他们因为一些
that you don't permit 'em stringing me up

770
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,150
我他妈完全没做的事情而把我吊死
over something I had nothing to do with, not fuck all.

771
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,270
萨缪尔 现在还没人想用私刑来惩罚你
Nobody's trying to lynch you at this moment here, Samuel.

772
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
如果你认真地看着我
And if you look at me hard,

773
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,230
你就会知道
you'll know

774
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,070
他们在绞死你之前
they'll have to kill me down the road

775
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,730
得先从我的尸体上踏过去
before they get to do it then.

776
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,690
希望你在出言不逊之前想清楚了 警长
Bless you seeing clear to say so, Marshal,

777
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,650
并且给我找个好律师
and get me a good goddamn lawyer.

778
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,520
抱歉迟到了 痛风作怪了
Sorry for the lateness. Gout's flaring.

779
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,900
我刚在医生那里
Was at the Doc's.

780
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,320
最近经常听到你痛风的事啊 哈利
Been hearing about your gout a lot lately, Harry.

781
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,480
就像魔鬼拿着小叉在戳我一样
Pokes me like devil's in there working with a tiny pitchfork.

782
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,570
这里什么情况
How's this going?

783
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,730
给我找个好律师 警长
Get me a good goddamn lawyer, Marshal!

784
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:47,270
? 我站立在 ?
? I was standing on the banks ?

785
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,770
? 河流的岸边上 ?
? Of the river ?

786
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,940
? 眺望着 ?
? Looking out ?

787
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,400
? 生命的 ?
? Over life's ?

788
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,400
? 波涛汹涌 ?
? Troubled seas ?

789
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,940
? 当我看到 ?
? When I saw ?

790
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,070
? 水上有一艘 ?
? An old ship ?

791
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,270
? 旧船在航行 ?
? That was sailing ?

792
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,650
? 是那艘 ?
? Is that the old... ?

793
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,520
来吧 简 查理葬礼时间到了
Come on, Jane. Time for Charlie's burial.

794
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,230
记得比尔去世的时候吗
Remember when Bill passed?

795
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,610
查理过于痛心以至于离开镇上
Charlie so broke up he'd been out the camp,

796
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,360
最后没能赶上葬礼
couldn't attend the goodbye?

797
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,770
我也记得 女孩们几乎都
And I recollect, too, girl barely

798
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,360
比肩接踵地
could put one foot front the other

799
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,610
只为了送比尔・希科克最后一程
but weren't gonna fail to see Bill Hickok off.

800
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:56,110
当索尔・史达和我来到这个地方的时候
When Sol Star and I came to this community,

801
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,190
查理・乌特
Charlie Utter...

802
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,520
是第一个上前问候的人
was first man forward offering his hand in greeting.

803
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,360
随着时间的推移 索尔和我
Over time, Sol and I formed a...

804
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,730
与查理结下了深厚的友谊
friendship with Charlie.

805
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,020
这丰富了我们的生活
Enriched our lives.

806
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,900
言归正传 他是个善良正义的人
Come up to proper, he was good-natured and just.

807
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,730
无论何时何地
Come to any way at all,

808
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,270
我从未见过有人让他退缩
I never saw a man stand him down.

809
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,070
只有把他
Only right

810
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,440
埋葬在他为之奋斗的土地上才是正确的
he should be buried on the land he worked his life for.

811
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,400
查理被错误地从我们身边带走了
Charlie was took from us wrongful,

812
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,150
他被
and he was...

813
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,110
他被带走得太早了
He was took too soon.

814
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,690
为了一个好人的灵魂
We ask respite

815
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,520
我们在此恳求
for a good man's soul.

816
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,020
求主把他带回家
Pray the Lord carry him home.

817
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,150
没有人像查理一样支持我
No man never stood up for me how Charlie did,

818
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,940
也不必细说以何种方式
nor with no word 'bout doing it, neither.

819
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,860
阿门
Amen.

820
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,400
阿门
Amen to that.

821
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,730
先生们
Gentlemen.

822
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,980
参议员赫斯特在等我们
Senator Hearst expecting us.

823
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,520
九号房间
Room number nine.

824
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,980
加州来的马屁精
Constituents of the cocksucker from California?

825
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,230
连一点日常礼貌都不懂吗
Don't I deserve common courtesy?

826
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,480
我为这个镇的镇长服务
May I mention service as this community's mayor,

827
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,320
尽管得承认我们很大程度上持对立态度
albeit admittedly a largely titular position.

828
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,520
但事实就是事实
But, facts are facts.

829
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:01,860
先生们 可以的话这是你们应得的认可
Well deserved, if modest, recognitions, gentlemen.

830
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,650
干的不错
Jobs well done.

831
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,230
如果你认为给予这份认可
Well, if you call them recognitions

832
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,610
就可以的话 赫斯特先生
just modest, Mr. Hearst,

833
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,270
我向上帝祈祷 你会在
I pray to Christ we run across you

834
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,770
耀武扬威的那一天遇见我们
the day you're showing off.

835
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,070
确定你们没被看见吧
Certain you were unseen?

836
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,360
几英里内荒无人烟
Not a human eye for miles.

837
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,940
丹尼斯 看来这个人脑浆快流完了啊
Man looks to be losing his mind, Dennis.

838
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,320
-那个方向 -什么鬼
- That direction. - What the fuck?

839
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,230
今天早些时候
I saw a fisherman at the claim

840
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,110
有人声称
earlier in the day.

841
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,190
在小溪边看见了
Dark-complected fellow,

842
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,520
一个黑人渔夫
wading the stream.

843
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,770
你让我严重怀疑我们杀的
You bring me to wonder aloud if that last

844
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,770
是个秃头的冒充者
was a bald-faced fabrication.

845
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,570
我的消息来源说警长
My sources say Marshal's

846
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:51,400
为了收集证据 找到了一个证人
collected a witness, for a fact.

847
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,480
我付钱希望得到的
I paid for execution

848
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,770
是专业级的刺杀
at a level of professional excellence.

849
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,320
你们被委托
You were commissioned...

850
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,270
完成这一份工作
to undertake of certain effort.

851
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,150
也就无需声明
It went without saying that

852
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,940
你们需要处理一切
you would address any complications

853
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,360
可能接踵而至的情况
that might ensue.

854
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,690
这是合同的一部分 先生 是的
Part of the contract, sir, yes.

855
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,440
他们拘留了一个人
They have someone in custody,

856
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,730
这就意味着你们在满足我的需求上
which fails, by a considerable margin,

857
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,940
大大地失败了
to please me.

858
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,980
我强烈建议你们处理好这件事
I strongly suggest you handle it.

859
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,190
我们他妈的该怎么进警察局
How the fuck are we supposed to get into the marshal's office?

860
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:38,150
以检查这个这个消息的真实性
Check on the veracity of this claim?

861
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:43,440
我的消息来源可信且并不简单
My sources are to be trusted, it won't be easy.

862
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,270
但是 这也不是不可能的
But, neither will it be impossible.

863
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,940
我懂了
I see.

864
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,150
这附加服务
This further business,

865
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,400
如果成功完成
if successfully brought to fruition,

866
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,440
我会给你们每个人
will earn each of you...

867
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,150
另外的50美元
$50 additional.

868
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,770
这才像话嘛
Well, now we're talkin'.

869
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,570
-黑人渔夫是吗 -这差事不难吧
- The Negro fisherman? - That'd be a job well done.

870
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,690
老天
Judas Priest!

871
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,980
法纳姆先生 借一步说话
A word with you, Mr. Farnum!

872
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,570
我的财产昨晚被纵火
Property of mine fell victim to arson last night.

873
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,940
参议员 我很理解
So, Senator, I'm gave to understand.

874
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,520
多可怕的消息啊
What dreadful news.

875
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,320
订购木材
Place this lumber order.

876
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,110
主要为供应商优先
The vendor is in Lead.

877
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,480
告诉那个人
Tell the man

878
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:47,650
每周交货 直到另行通知
weekly deliveries until further notice.

879
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,020
发电报吗 先生
By telegraph, sir?

880
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,860
外面有一部公用电话
There is a public telephone just outside.

881
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,730
进步点吧 法纳姆先生
Take the leap, Mr. Farnum.

882
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,690
未来在前方
The future awaits.

883
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,360
先生 队伍一直排得很长
The queue, sir, stretches.

884
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,770
你看到那流氓了吗
Have you seen the riffraff lined up?

885
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,110
他可能会拖延进度
Stall progress he may.

886
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,230
但他无法阻止
Stop it he cannot.

887
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,980
每件生意 法纳姆先生
Every business, Mr. Farnum,

888
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,940
在这片土地上兴旺发达
in this territory thrives

889
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,900
都是沟通后的直接结果
as a direct result of communication.

890
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,150
现在 我们对现代进步的节奏
Now, we've no say as to the pace

891
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,730
没有发言权
of modernity's advance.

892
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,820
我自己也只是 它的容器之一
I myself am merely... its vessel.

893
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,320
如同卑微的步兵一般
A humble foot soldier.

894
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,110
它的必然性才最深刻的真理 --
Its inevitability is the deepest truth--

895
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,480
你到底怎么了 该死的
What is wrong with you, goddamn it, to be

896
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,980
你的脚不停地在动
shifting your feet so incessantly?

897
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,150
每年的这个时候
Uh, the procession of years,

898
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,480
纵欲过度
wanton leakage.

899
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,650
你真恶心
You are a vile creature.

900
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:42,150
你也不是第一个这么说的了
Nor are you first to say so.

901
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,610
滚出去打电话
Get the hell out and place the call.

902
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,230
我会在最短的时间内完成
I'll detain you for the briefest moment.

903
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,480
-现在 -是的 先生 现在就去
- Now. - Yes, sir. Going.

904
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,650
朱厄尔 桃子是镇上的元老们聚会用的
Peaches, Jewel, are for meeting of the town elders.

905
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,520
而等会我们就要面对一场拍卖会
This prospect here before us, it's an auction.

906
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,650
这他妈就不是一回事
It's hardly the same fuckin' thing.

907
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,440
老天爷 你就不能找点事干吗 丹
God, you think about ever getting yourself a hobby, Dan?

908
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,320
小嘴再叭叭叭 信不信老子
And that smart-ass mouth of your'n is gonna get you

909
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,570
把你调回厨房打杂去
relegated back to the fucking kitchen.

910
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,900
这对赫斯特无效
Futile to go to Hearst this way.

911
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,690
不管他的后台怎么样 但很遗憾
No matter his resources, but it'd be a pity

912
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,610
他没有意识到危在旦夕的是什么
not to recognize what's at stake.

913
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,070
盲目前行 然后愚蠢地死去
To go ahead and die stupid.

914
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:26,270
他不想到死都是一个傻子 是吗
Hate to end a fool, right?

915
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,190
查理・乌特肯定不是
Sure as hell Charlie Utter didn't.

916
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,610
你只需要记住一点 做好分内的事
What's essential is you remember, do your part.

917
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,820
还有其他吩咐吗 警长
Oh, naught else, Marshal?

918
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,940
有要洗的衣服吗
Laundry required?

919
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,940
有的话我叫你
I'll let you know.

920
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,110
你去哪了 布洛克
Where you been, Bullock?

921
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,110
去街上转了转 艾尔
Right up the fuckin' road, Al.

922
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,480
妈蛋
God damn it!

923
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,730
破玩意儿
Goddamn it.

924
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,570
我的妈呀 能出个声不
My goodness. A voice?

925
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,320
你好啊 对面的朋友

It's Deadwood's mayor, E.B. Farnum,

929
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,610
议员先生命我告知伐木供应商
calling Lead Lumber at the senator's behest.

930
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,820
这件事结束之前 那个黑人必须得死
The Negro will lay slain before this concludes.

931
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,690
天呐 我得去找布洛克

Rode in, did you, Marshal, on a Trojan horse?

957
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,400
意为来者不善

958

谁
Who did?

1035
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,150
想陷害我是吗 警长
Set up, Marshal, are we?

1036
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,230
正义与仁慈相得益彰

1037
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,690
觉得自己更爷们了吗

1038
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:48,900
最好把下一批木材控制起来
Better lock the next shipment of lumber up.

1039
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,770
你的勋章最好能保你

就像你的议员身份

1042

最好可以护你免遭牢狱之灾

1043
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,860
让这个狗娘养的放下武器

1044
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,440
都进去
Inside, now.

1045
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,190
我中弹了
Fuckin' shot, I am!

1046
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,610
死不了
You'll fuckin' live.

1047
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,020
约翰尼

1048
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:34,320
恭喜你手里又多了几条人命

我不觉得有什么可骄傲的

1050
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,690
我会来找你算账的 警长

1051
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,820
我等着你 议员先生
Expect you will, Senator.

1052
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,070
赫斯特先生
Mr. Hearst?

1053
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,940
抱着你儿子
Hold your son.

1054
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,900
哄他睡着 给他喂奶
Rock him towards sleep. Feed him his milk

1055
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,270
我已经挤到奶瓶里了

1056
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,020
要是尿了就给他换洗尿布
Clean and change him when he does his business.

1057
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:43,820
等等 崔西 你要去哪
Wait, Trixie, where are you going?

1058
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,360
先是艾尔急匆匆的打电话说要见我
First, Al's urgent call to see me.

1059
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,480
然后 他又派人送来另一套说辞
Then, he sends this note sayin' the opposite.

1060
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:54,190
你怎么了 索尔
What the fuck, Sol?

1061
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,690
不是我的血
Not mine.

1062
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,730
附带的罢了
Collateral damage is all.

1063
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,520
那是谁的血啊
Well, whose fucking blood is it?

1064
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:02,070
杀害查理的凶手 已经死了
Men who murdered Charlie, dead now.

1065
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,580
先祖显灵了吗
Oh, the Hebrew takes to arms!

1066
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,270
崔西 你冷静点
Trixie, please calm down.

1067
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,230
那抱着他

1068
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,820
-不要 -看在上帝的份上
- No. - For God's sakes.

1069
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,860
我要去见艾尔
I'm getting Al's counsel.

1070
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,650
孩子留给了他爹
With our baby stood with his father,

1071
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:21,480
再过他娘的20多分钟
20 possible minutes or a fucking cunt hair more.

1072
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,320
我就从旅店的后门出去
I'll exit back of the hotel,

1073
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,230
像个贼一样悄咪咪的
sneaky as a mouse,

1074
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,110
溜到酒馆前的小路上
and enter the Gem a side way.

1075
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,900
又愚蠢又冲动的娘们
Being stupid and fuckin' reckless.

1076
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:34,070
你个犹太混蛋 也许我就是愚蠢又冲动
As I may be both, you Jew bastard,

1077
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:36,320
才选择踏出这道门
to get out the fuckin' door.

1078
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:14,020
打到了你的脑袋和肩膀吗 老头
Beatin' you about head and shoulders, lad?

1079
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:19,480
他们刚刚占了上风
Their's the upper hand just now.

1080
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,400
你的某些选择 让你被赫斯特注意到了
Some choice, making your presence known to Hearst.

1081
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,650
不管我惹了什么麻烦
Whatever trouble I caused...

1082
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:48,400
都是因为我突然有了孩子
blame the baby's imminent arrival.

1083
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,730
我杀了那个小女孩是为了救你
I took that young girl's life to save yours.

1084
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,150
艾尔 求你 别再说了
Please, Al, don't say it again.

1085
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:01,020
珍的脸在我脑海挥之不去
Haunts me, Jen's face does.

1086
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,690
你又没抹她的脖子
Weren't you cut her throat,

1087
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:08,440
也没有设计一个差点害死所有人的计划
nor devised a fuckin' plan that nearly got us all killed.

1088
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,320
上帝怜悯我
God have mercy on me.

1089
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,190
我连一分钟的幸福时光都不配拥有
I don't deserve the one fuckin' minute of happiness,

1090
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:20,190
直到我的新生儿降临
my newborn gave me coming into the world.

1091
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:23,150
我们选了救你这疯女人
We chose you, you loopy cunt.

1092
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,020
看你把我们搞的
Look at the fuckin' mess you've give us.

1093
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:27,110
我他妈根本不值得你这样啊 艾尔
I'm un-fucking-worthy, Al!

1094
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,690
躺棺材里的应该是我 不是她啊
I belonged in that coffin, not her!

1095
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,320
行吧 如果你一心求死的话
Well, if your aim was to die, please,

1096
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,610
那我愿意送你一程
allow me to do the honors.

1097
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:46,570
我们都被自己乱七八糟的想法所困扰
We're all of us haunted by our own fucking thoughts,

1098
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,440
你就赶紧去黄泉跟她做伴吧
so make friends with her ghost!

1099
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,980
随便都可以去死
It ain't going fuckin' anywhere!

1100
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,070
对不起
I'm sorry...

1101
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,320
真的对不起
for everything.

1102
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:17,360
老天爷开眼了啊
Heavens open up.

1103
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,150
她居然还会忏悔
She expresses contrition.

1104
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:35,360
也就是说镇里添了个新生儿
New baby in camp?

1105
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,570
是个可爱的小男孩
Lovely little boy.

1106
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:46,360
有其母必有其子的
As born of his mother, he would be.

1107
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,730
你有阻止过她的离去吗
Did you try and stop her from leaving?

1108
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,270
天啊 能做的我都做了
Nothing I could do. Jesus Christ.

1109
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:02,730
萨缪尔被关起来的事我只告诉过斯威伦根
Swearengen's the only one I told Samuel's in the cage.

1110
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:07,440
他虽非好人 但也绝非告密者
Man may be a lot of things, but he's not a snitch.

1111
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,250
照目前的的状况
State he's in, more likely fuckin'

1112
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,150
他可能早把那段对话忘没了
forgot the conversation entirely.

1113
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:20,610
让你少惹麻烦的这个要求过分么
Too much ask you stay the hell outta trouble?

1114
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:26,270
不过分 布洛克
No, fuckin' Bullock.

1115
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,440
并不过分
Not too much.

1116
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:32,070
我不会再惹是生非了
I will.

1117
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,900
艾尔的状况很糟
Not himself, Al weren't.

1118
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:47,320
我从来没见他虚弱成那样
Weak like I never seen him.

1119
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,480
去收拾行李
Gather some things now.

1120
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:55,110
我们要在布洛克家过夜
We're spending the night at the Bullock house.

1121
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,820
咱们得远离镇中心了
Moving us from the center of town.

1122
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:01,980
索尔 我不想离开这儿
Hate runnin' from him, Sol.

1123
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,020
为孩子着想吧
For our boy.

1124
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,690
他还能活下来么
What are the odds him comin' to?

1125
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,110
他被打得伤势过重
He's severely injured from the beating.

1126
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,730
脾脏破裂
Spleen's ruptured.

1127
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,650
腹腔积血
Blood in his belly.

1128
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,730
没可能了么
Odds on it ending?

1129
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:41,360
人终有一死
All bleeding stops eventually.

1130
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,820
索尔 我们应该明天就结婚
We ought marry on the morrow, Sol.

1131
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,610
艾尔可能快命不久矣了
Al ain't to be relied on to linger.

1132
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:21,150
我们不必遮遮掩掩地成婚
And we ain't exchangin' secret fuckin' vows,

1133
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,400
而是光明正大的向彼此许下诺言
tucked away in hiding.

1134
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:28,770
随时恭候
Free all day.

1135
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,610
干得好啊
Oh, well done.

1136
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,900
干得漂亮啊
Proud performance.

1137
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,150
都他妈直接尿自己一身了
Fuckin' pissed myself.

1138
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:43,020
典礼前二十分钟
Twenty minutes going forward to the ceremony,

1139
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:46,190
以及之后的二十分钟内
nor neither the same interval afterwards.

1140
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:48,980
还有在典礼过程中 都不得通奸
No fornication on the premises.

1141
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:59,360
凭什么她就能抱着孩子
Why does she get to hold him?

1142
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:01,690
因为新娘是我
Because I'm the bride,

1143
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,730
这个大喜的日子里老娘说了算
and it's my special fuckin' day.

1144
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,610
赶紧去帮把手啊 等什么呢
Lend fucking hands, girls!

1145
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,270
好好布置这里
Make the place presentable.

1146
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:14,190
真想娶那个女孩啊
May make that girl my wife.

1147
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,650
她肯定是个有恋父情节的女人
She ain't gonna marry no man age enough to be her daddy.

1148
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:20,730
十指纤纤轻掠过我的双眸
Soft hands smoothed my brow.

1149
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,860
双葱好似有点点茉莉花香
Wrist smelling like jasmine.

1150
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:27,570
一针一线缝满了我的心房
She sewed the hole in my shoulder closed with needle and thread.

1151
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:29,570
然后趁缝的时候把你钱包偷走呗
Lift your wallet while she's doing it?

1152
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:31,820
丹 你也太阴暗了
That's a dark view of the world, Dan.

1153
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,610
医生 我请求您指点迷津
I ask to be enlightened as to

1154
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,820
我的生命是否行之将末
the passage of spirit in prospect for me, Doc.

1155
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:47,520
我把人体看作为一个细胞的总合
I take us to be collections of cells,

1156
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,900
每个细胞又会在其内部聚集成一个更小的
each aggregate a smaller,

1157
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,690
更为独立的生命个体
separate life inside us, and...

1158
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:56,320
随着时间慢慢的流逝
and time slows.

1159
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:00,020
这个小生命体也终将走到尽头
And finally stops.

1160
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:05,900
我这个细胞总和最后也会落得这个下场呗
The fate my cell collections live into as we speak.

1161
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,690
艾尔 现在还没有个统一的定论
That ain't so to a mortal certainty, Al.

1162
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:17,770
医生 我不想就这么苟延残喘下去
I'd not prolong the chewing up, Doc, nor the being spat out.

1163
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,730
也不想这么窝囊的死
Not go out a cunt.

1164
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:23,320
迈向死亡的过程实在是太丢人了
It's the dispatch I find inglorious.

1165
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:27,270
简直是自欺欺人
The whole delusory fucking self-importance.

1166
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:35,980
-那你还参加婚礼么 -非去不可
- Is it your hope to attend the wedding? - It's my resolve.

1167
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:37,440
那好吧
All right then.

1168
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:41,730
张嘴
Pucker up.

1169
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,150
给我吧
I'll take him.

1170
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:56,070
为何觉得自己就应该生而为妓呢
Believe you were born to be a whore?

1171
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:00,270
也许这是最适合我的路吧
Probably doing what I'm fit for.

1172
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,270
逼你出来卖的那杂种是费了多大功夫
How hard you suppose the bastard turned you out

1173
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,570
才让你信了他那一套鬼话的
had to work to make you think that?

1174
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:10,440
崔西
Trixie.

1175
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,650
该上楼了
Got an appointment upstairs.

1176
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:24,770
哎呀 就这么往我脸上打喷嚏
Oh, well, I hope you're proud,

1177
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,020
看来你挺自豪的吧
expelling your sneeze in my mug.

1178
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:32,190
艾尔 这可是上帝赐福啊
That's the Lord's blessing come upon you, Al.

1179
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:34,520
是主在亲自俯身吻你的脸颊呢
That's him leanin' down to kiss your cheek.

1180
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:47,070
我就跟你开门见山了吧
Well, I ain't got no time left for fancy dancin'.

1181
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:50,110
若我把店交给你 你怎么看
Your thoughts on me leaving you the joint?

1182
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,610
不 我的意思不是说
No, not being either to say

1183
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,690
让你接着干老鸨的行当
you have to run women.

1184
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:03,320
但我强烈建议
I strongly endorse that.

1185
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,480
把这里改成一个舞厅吧
Make it a dance hall for all of me.

1186
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:12,070
艾尔怎么不从马戏团运来点大象助兴呢
What about the circus elephants, Al,

1187
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:14,400
是不是听着就挺好玩的
producing some novel effect?

1188
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,480
崔西 改成舞厅不失为一个好主意
Dance hall, Trixie, ain't a bad idea.

1189
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:19,730
你看你找了个多好的男人啊
Good man you got there!

1190
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,270
有情有义
Heart, soul,

1191
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,400
脑子也够用
and brains enough to know that he struck lucky

1192
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,570
明白自己何德何能才遇见了你
in his female companion.

1193
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:30,570
真是孩子的好榜样啊
Good example for the kid to emulate.

1194
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,150
我传授人生经验可是分文不取的
And no fee for the sermon.

1195
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,480
失陪一会
Excuse me now.

1196
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:42,940
过来
Hey.

1197
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,770
你为何不考虑竞选公职呢
Maybe you oughta think about running for office?

1198
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:53,270
如今当权的都是一帮子庸人
Outnumbered, as we are, by shit-birds.

1199
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,570
斯威伦根先生 我会慎重考虑的
Food for thought, Mr. Swearengen.

1200
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:00,730
这个主意
That idea

1201
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,570
就当作给你们的结婚礼物了
is my wedding gift to you.

1202
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:05,860
多谢你
Thank you.

1203
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,980
听说你在这儿
Heard you was down here.

1204
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,110
这匹马原来是查理的
This one was Charlie's.

1205
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:09,440
现在是你的了
Yours now.

1206
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:12,110
相信他也希望如此
Sure he'd want that.

1207
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,020
发生康娜妮那件事后
Past when I took what Cy gave me,

1208
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,770
我曾希望自己不要再醒过来
I'd pray I wouldn't wake up.

1209
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:33,150
没骨气的怂货 不准再这么说了
You gutless cunt. Don't you speak that way to me again.

1210
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,570
我的意思是说那都是过眼云烟了
Nor neither am I saying I feel that way now, is my point.

1211
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,520
你
You...

1212
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:41,730
我要你狠狠地吻我
gimme a goddamn kiss and say, "I promise

1213
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:45,020
然后起誓无论多么厌世
I won't fold, no matter how sad I get."

1214
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,190
都绝不会动轻生的念头
Or just don't say a word at all then.

1215
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,190
现在闭嘴快点来吻我
Just go ahead and give me a kiss and don't say a word.

1216
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,320
好吧 这可真是
All right. Well...

1217
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:13,980
这一下让我想起了你吻技有多么高超
You bring to recollection you're a hell of a good kisser.

1218
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,440
你还在嚼甘草吗
And you're still chewing that licorice?

1219
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,730
相比我其它的罪恶 这可太微不足道了
That's my 12th least-worst sin.

1220
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:25,440
床垫里面有一万四千零五十美元
Time comes, I have $14,057 in the mattress,

1221
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,940
等我挂了后你们平分了吧
which you will divide equally.

1222
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,820
要是你们为此起了争执
You fight amongst yourselves,

1223
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,770
那就祈祷这个世上没有地狱吧
you will wish there was no hell

1224
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:35,520
不然老子再还魂来宰了你们几个
because I will surely come back and cut your fuckin' throats.

1225
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,690
-我对你的遗产不感兴趣 -哦是么
- Well, I don't want your money. - Yeah...

1226
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:41,940
瞧瞧
There.

1227
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,440
先生们
Gentlemen...

1228
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,110
咱们像不像四胞胎啊
can we not appear as quadruplets?

1229
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,270
感谢主能使你下床
Bless you for being upright,

1230
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,820
能让我牵着你的臂弯
for letting me have my hand on your arm,

1231
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,900
还使你可以出尽风头
and for being the showing-up sort that you are.

1232
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:28,900
将复何求
What's else is gravy.

1233
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,520
安全送达
Safe passage to us all.

1234
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:00,440
你今天真美 亲爱的
Oh, you're a picture, miss.

1235
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:04,940
谢谢你
Means something.

1236
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:20,020
绕郎三圈
Three times I go around?

1237
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:22,070
有枝可依
Always coming back.

1238
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,480
永不离弃
I ain't gave to flight.

1239
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,940
正直
Righteousness.

1240
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,570
慈爱
Loving kindness.

1241
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,070
正义
Justice.

1242
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,400
我并不是很懂
For all in my ignorance,

1243
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,730
也不是一定要求遵循守据
I, uh, do not hew to the letter of,

1244
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,900
但我还是希望
uh, its practice, but I'd hope

1245
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,900
这个简约的婚礼
the brief ceremony

1246
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,190
可以遵守犹太礼仪
will be respectful to... Jewishness!

1247
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:13,320
再好不过了牧师 尽力就好
Level best, Reverend! A for effort.

1248
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,570
孩子 祝福你
Eh, bless you, my son,

1249
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,900
感谢你如此体谅
and thank you for understanding.

1250
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:19,360
祝词讲完了
Sermon's over.

1251
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,190
可以了
That's all!

1252
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:25,110
现在我要请索菲亚小姐
I'll now ask the young Miss Sofia

1253
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:28,520
将婚戒呈送上来
to come forward with the nuptial rings.

1254
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,110
以二位所信宗教赋予之权利
By the powers of each of their religions and practices,

1255
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:40,440
我宣布索尔和崔西结为夫妇
I now pronounce Sol and Trixie man and wife.

1256
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,360
该不该让新郎吻你
Should your husband kiss you?

1257
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,770
他要敢不吻就睡外面吧
Lest he be sleepin' outdoors.

1258
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,820
简 我一直想出去见见世面
Been thinking, Jane. Maybe I'd like to see the world.

1259
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:19,650
比如法兰西是什么样的
For instance, what's France like?

1260
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:20,980
不知道呢
Don't know.

1261
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,820
你说的倒是让我有兴趣了
Never wanted to see it till this minute.

1262
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,860
欢乐时刻啊
Happy occasion.

1263
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:18,820
爸爸
Papa!

1264
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,980
你还好吧
Are you all right?

1265
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:04,070
咱们计划一下怎么用那块土地吧
Let's... figure out what to do with that land.

1266
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,440
耶稣 圣母玛利亚 圣人们啊
Ah, Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and all risen saints.

1267
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:54,230
求你三思而后行
For once in your life, resist the urge for utterance.

1268
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:59,900
以我的新生儿为见证
As witness before my newborn child

1269
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,150
我希望一切能够重新开始
my hope in beginning again,

1270
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:04,190
我希望双方都保持克制
I pray we forbear from

1271
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:06,270
别再互相折磨
fucking up each other's lives further,

1272
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,320
而是和平共处
and live in peace and quiet.

1273
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,980
史达夫人 我能察觉到
It seems to me, Mrs. Star,

1274
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,820
在你努力讨好我的背后
in coming forward to conciliate me,

1275
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,230
你的内心痛苦不堪
you consign yourself to a misery

1276
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,860
就像在经历着一次
not unlike a sort of...

1277
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,070
酷刑
execution.

1278
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:29,610
这两位是来自邻镇的
These two gentlemen are sheriff and deputy

1279
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:30,980
警长和副警长
from a neighboring town,

1280
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:33,480
我找他们代表我的权益
brought in to represent my interests.

1281
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,650
这是里德的拉瑞比警长
Sheriff Laraby from Lead.

1282
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:38,860
我们有一份指控崔西・史达
We have a warrant for the arrest of Trixie Star

1283
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,610
谋杀乔治・赫斯特先生未遂的逮捕令
for the attempted murder of Mr. George Hearst.

1284
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:42,150
你给我滚出去
You get the hell outta here.

1285
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:44,230
孩子 请克制自己以免失态
Forbear, son, lest you be undone.

1286
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,860
我不是你的孩子
I'm not your son,

1287
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:48,150
你也不是他妈的未来的主宰
no more than you're the boss of the fuckin' future.

1288
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:51,190
是吗 我可自认是未来的继承人
Why, I believe I am its whole inheritor.

1289
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,020
这些人在这里没有司法管辖权
These men have no jurisdiction here.

1290
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,070
想必你带来的这两人
I'm guessing these two you brought

1291
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,190
并不知道你的在这里犯下的滔天大罪
don't know the extent of your crimes here.

1292
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:01,860
此乃查理・乌特命案的主要嫌疑犯
Prime suspect in the murder of Charlie Utter.

1293
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,320
你又要把我关起来吗
Are you going to incarcerate me again,

1294
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,650
布洛克警长
Marshal Bullock?

1295
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:08,860
这次又要关我几分钟
This time, for how many minutes?

1296
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:11,230
到时候就知道了
Let's find out together.

1297
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,900
-手铐有点紧了 -闭嘴
- Little tight on my wrist. - Shut up.

1298
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:18,230
到我的地盘上 你要先给警长打招呼
Come through my town, you stop at the marshal's office first.

1299
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,480
至少和同行打个招呼 给点他妈的尊重
Way a fellow lawman would do, showing any fuckin' respect.

1300
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:24,020
很抱歉打搅了各位 请继续庆典吧
Sorry for the interruption. Carry on with the celebration.

1301
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,980
笑一个 赫斯特议员
Smile, Senator Hearst!

1302
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,230
-把他撵走 -总算走了
- Get him outta here. - Good riddance!

1303
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:41,900
在你把他关起来之前
'Fore you lock him up,

1304
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:45,360
不妨让我们跟赫斯特先生说几句话
no harm you letting us have a word with Mr. Hearst.

1305
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,400
代逝去的查理・乌特说几句话
Speaking for Charlie Utter, as is gone from amongst us.

1306
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,730
这里怎么回事 怎么了
What's going on here? What's in train?

1307
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:55,230
这个美利坚合众国参议员
This United States of American Senator

1308
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,400
买凶谋杀了查理・乌特

1309
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,110
-他是个杀人犯 -毫无悔意
- Yeah! He's a murderer! - Without remorse!

1310
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:03,520
-既没有偿命 -看你往哪躲
- Nor recourse! - Can't hide behind that!

1311
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:06,110
也他妈的没有一点悔过之心
Nor fucking recollection!

1312
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,070
我要把你的头给拧下来
I'll tear your head clean off, boy,

1313
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,610
看你还能不能回忆起来
if that'll help recollection.

1314
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:12,190
谁再扔东西就别怪我不客气了
Who heaves something next gets dealt with.

1315
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,230

- You entitled motherfucker! - Son of a bitch.

1316
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,440
管好你的人 警长
Steer your people, Marshal.

1317
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,440
闭上你的嘴
Shut the fuck up!

1318
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,900
谁也不用听谁的
Nobody answering no one!

1319
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,690
-想干嘛就干嘛 -你说的真对
-Do what-all they want! - You got that right!

1320
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,900
快走 走 快走
Go on now! Go! Go.

1321
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:02,610
悠着点儿 什么鬼
Easy! What the hell?

1322
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,860
让我们了结了他吧
Come on, let us finish it.

1323
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:08,110
别去打他了
Leave him be.

1324
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:10,320
天哪
My God...

1325
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,150
除非你们所有人都想被我抓起来
Lest I arrest every one of you.

1326
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,360
我看不下去了
I've seen enough.

1327
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,690
去找个医生来
Get the fuckin' Doc.

1328
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:31,980
是啊 帮这个混账东西疗伤止痛
Oh yeah, let's do allay the cocksucker in his misery.

1329
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:34,150
去找医生 简
Now, Jane!

1330
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:36,610
诅咒你横尸街头
Hope you die in the street.

1331
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:38,190
就像我父亲一样

1332

都回家去吧
Go on home, now!

1333
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,520
你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!

1334
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:50,940
你这出游行示众闹够了没
Have you finished your impotent display?

1335
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,230
不 我觉得还不够呢
No, I don't believe I have.

1336
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:52,770
你到时要给我作证 参议员
You're my witness, Senator.

1337
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,610
我因警长要杀你才开的枪
Marshal's trying to kill you.

1338
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,270
这懦夫想从背后阴你 布洛克
Coward was coming behind you, Bullock.

1339
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,900
从背后一枪崩了你
'Bout to shoot you back the head.

1340
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,110
简
Jane!

1341
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,480
你个狗娘养的 哈利
You son of a bitch, Harry.

1342
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:30,730
刚那会儿我被比尔附身了
That was Bill come into me.

1343
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,570
他回来保护我们了

1344
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:35,320
不 简 那只是你而已
No, Jane. That was you.

1345
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,320
警长啊
The Good Book, Marshal...

1346
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:03,980
《圣经》上说
says...

1347
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:07,270
上帝挑选的见证人
the Lord chooses amongst His witnesses...

1348
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:11,020
会是看起来最不可能的那个
them'd be thought least likely.

1349
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,270
是吗
Is that so?

1350
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:22,610
你也许应该知道
You might should oughta know...

1351
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:27,610
在事情发生前
before what happened...

1352
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:30,190
乌特先生
Mr. Utter...

1353
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:33,020
看起来
seemed to me...

1354
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:35,020
像变了一个人
a different man.

1355
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,270
像是刚刚如释重负
Like a weight had come off his shoulders.

1356
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,980
你知道《圣经》上关于见证人
What else they say

1357
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:50,230
还怎么说吗
about the Lord's witnesses?

1358
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:55,520
怎么说
What else?

1359
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:58,690
他们的缺点
Their defects...

1360
01:40:58,770 --> 01:41:00,860
暂时抛开不谈
notwithstanding,

1361
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,860
他们见证了
they testify to His

1362
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:04,730
主的神迹
wond'rous glory.

1363
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,570
警长 他在弥留之际唱着歌
Singing, he was, at the end, Marshal,

1364
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,320
唱着他在山谷徜徉
'bout walking the valley.

1365
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:22,820
听起来愉悦而扣人心弦
Joyful to hear and behold.

1366
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:38,070
就这样唱着
Singing.

1367
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:01,110
如果你肯听我的话
If you have it in you to abide,

1368
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:03,150
我是不会让你离开我的
I'd not have you leave me.

1369
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:04,770
我不会离开的 艾尔
I won't, Al.

1370
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:07,770
时辰到了 我和朱厄尔会陪你到最后
Comes to it, Jewel and me will see to you.

1371
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:10,480
我会让人把孩子抱过来
I'll have the little one brought in.

1372
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:15,940
我前几天听见你在唱歌
I heard you singing the other day.

1373
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:18,110
我还以为是哪只青蛙被你踩到了呢
I thought you'd stepped a frog.

1374
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:24,150
如果你需要的话 艾尔
If you want, Al,

1375
01:42:24,230 --> 01:42:27,440
我可以给你按摩脚 手虽有点抖
I can rub your feet, shaky hands,

1376
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,440
不过挺好使的
but it works well.

1377
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,150
来吧
Go ahead then.
