1
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:36,980
Mười năm đi,
'proaching rằng selfsame đồi

2
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:40,067
Tôi nghĩ để đặt tôi xuống
và đừng dậy nữa.

3
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,160
Oof!

4
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:45,830
Hãy cho tôi bến rộng!
Đó chỉ là thông qua gió!

5
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:49,667
Có thể tồi tệ hơn.

6
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,752
Trước mắt đóng cho tốt và tất cả,

7
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:03,090
Tôi muốn một lần nữa nhìn thấy Joanie Stubbs tôi,

8
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,177
cho cô ấy biết là dấu hiệu của

9
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,726
hối tiếc yêu thương

10
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,684
từ Calamity Jane để yêu cô.

11
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,775
Và với nó, ngôi mộ của Wild Bill.

12
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,998
Ooh!

13
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:35,880
Tôi đã một trái má ass vỉ là
một đứa con trai thấm của một con chó cái.

14
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:06,156
Tốt, ngay tại đó.

15
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:17,414
Buổi sáng, ông chủ!

16
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:18,623
Nhận tôi gimp.

17
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:21,209
Jewel! Gì?

18
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:22,672
Hãy đứng dậy ở đây.

19
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,426
Có một cái gì đó trên bếp, al!

20
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:27,723
Khi bạn hoàn thành đốt nó, sau đó?

21
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,926
Ho, ho, ho!

22
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:33,475
- Buổi sáng, Doc.
- Buổi sáng, Al.

23
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,063
Tại Liberty, bạn chỉ là bây giờ?

24
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:40,900
Tại sao, bạn muốn nhảy?

25
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:01,253
What'd rằng khoảng?

26
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:03,918
Fashioning vào cột điện thoại.

27
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:05,969
Ain't we got enough of
them damn things already?

28
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:10,555
Plan's to put lines in every business.
Catch up with the times!

29
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:17,228
Out of sorts,
would you say, commander?

30
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,559
Half a stride short of fully fit.

31
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:23,526
Light, somewhat, a few pounds.

32
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,197
And some bit pallid, too.

33
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,650
Jesus, just shoot me, Doc.

34
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,369
Name the day of the week, Al.

35
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,743
The fuck difference does the day make?

36
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,290
I'd have you but say the name.

37
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:38,085
Tuesday then, you half a
scarecrow-looking cocksucker.

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,377
- Friday, it is.
- Oh.

39
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:45,380
Mistaking Friday for Tuesday.
Well, secure my burial plot.

40
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:48,129
Well, your temperature's
two degrees above normal,

41
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:51,842
features drawn,
flesh of a yellowish cast.

42
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,936
Pending fucking developments...

43
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:57,263
I'd have you forbear from spirits.

44
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,605
- Under advisement.
- Oh, no, no, no.

45
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,062
Don't you humor me,
nor talk down to me, neither,

46
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,819
nor fix to mix in
where you ain't been invited.

47
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:10,193
Whilst you comport
the very like to me?

48
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:15,832
You went somewhat wrong at your liver,
Al, is what you've goddamn done!

49
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,414
Bar you being out-and-out blind,

50
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,128
you already know he's ill.

51
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,959
Minute past,

52
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:29,511
words to Dan, "boss is looking poorly."

53
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:30,972
"Out of sorts."

54
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:34,726
Don't he look outta sorts,
you goddamn donkey?

55
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:39,056
He is to forbear
from spirits of any kind,

56
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,767
until he's assayed and diagnosed.

57
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:49,444
You know he'll just endeavor
to import spirits in off the street?

58
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,275
Well, you're not to allow it!

59
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:53,903
That's easier told
than saddled and rode.

60
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:55,954
Then, go ahead and hang him,
god damn it!

61
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,657
Blow his fucking head off!

62
00:04:57,752 --> 00:04:59,663
Save us all some time!

63
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:07,132
Wrong side of the damn bed!

64
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:19,182
Ms. Ellsworth    ! Charlie Utter.

65
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,060
Oh, my.

66
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,858
What a grand surprise
after such a piece of time.

67
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:28,480
For me, Mr. Utter, as well.

68
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,856
Sofia come on!

69
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,781
Am I past my place, Ms. Ellsworth    ,

70
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,075
asking if it's banking
brings you back these parts?

71
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,287
Banking, yes.

72
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:44,753
But my interest in the Deadwood Bank,
which is an expanding institution...

73
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:51,927
Few years back, Ms. Ellsworth    ,
bad manners like that

74
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:54,551
woulda led to a lesson in courtesy!

75
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:58,347
Continuing grateful
for hard-won maturity.

76
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:05,351
Sofia, a gentleman wishes
to renew acquaintance, miss.

77
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:08,569
Charlie Utter saying hello
to Ms. Sofia.

78
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:12,274
The 10 years went past like
somebody snapped their fingers.

79
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:13,983
Hello back, Mr. Utter.

80
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:17,070
- It's lovely to see you again.
- Thank you.

81
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:20,456
Hey, I'd be happy to convey you all
into Deadwood camp in my wagon.

82
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:23,285
As we would be for the transport,

83
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,127
and your good company.

84
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,954
Come on.

85
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:29,381
I hope we're in time
for the Statehood celebration.

86
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,298
Hey, sweetheart.
Help you with that luggage.

87
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,254
Very kind, I'm okay.

88
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,393
Well, I assume
you'll be staying in town, darling.

89
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:39,387
Pardon me.

90
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:42,645
There a price we can offer
for that information?

91
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:44,722
You have me wrong.

92
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,652
- There you are!
- Hello there.

93
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,987
Looking for a ride. I can pay.

94
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,693
South Dakota marrying
the United States.

95
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,348
See, they're
paying attention, Seth.

96
00:06:58,372 --> 00:06:59,578
Morning, Miss.

97
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:00,825
Morning, Papa.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,537
Bullock clan ready
for the Statehood festivities.

99
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,084
Are you ready, husband,

100
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,755
considering the visiting delegates
include the Senator from California?

101
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,672
To celebrate, yes, I am.

102
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,052
I'm tempted to believe you.

103
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,593
Statehood pancakes coming out!

104
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,523
Clear the way!

105
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,394
All right, all right, little man.

106
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:31,023
Single-minded, this boy,
like his old man.

107
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,611
A virtue in your estimation.

108
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:38,700
Lord, bless these gifts
we ready to receive,

109
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,736
and Grant us grace
to meet level-headed

110
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,571
what challenges may come this day,

111
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,121
no matter the provocation by lesser

112
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,535
or evil men.

113
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:51,967
Amen.

114
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:54,212
Amen. Amen.

115
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,213
On this day
of our Statehood celebration...

116
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,387
Man: Hear, hear!

117
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:02,971
We honor a man,
who with unexampled generosity

118
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:06,225
has given himself
to our Deadwood community.

119
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:08,727
Though no longer residing amongst us,

120
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,643
he calls California now his home.

121
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:16,565
The man bases his considerable
mining and real estate interest

122
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,366
here in Deadwood, South Dakota.

123
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:23,366
I ask you please, to greet
with me now, the honorable

124
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:26,240
junior Senator from
the great State of California,

125
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,001
George Ambrose Hearst                     !

126
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:47,394
- Good morning to all!
- Man: Morning, Senator                       !

127
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:51,770
And great thanks to Mayor Farnum
for his generous words of welcome.

128
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,062
It moves me greatly,

129
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:01,154
returning after years have passed
to witness

130
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:05,162
the changes wrought by time,

131
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,873
ingenuity, and invention.

132
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:12,795
Though none would deny the facts
and the cost of a past,

133
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:16,211
we who gather have known together...

134
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:24,719
Some portion of which must still
be measured in blood.

135
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:30,354
Yet, the Deadwood community
does enter its adulthood...

136
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,183
And don't our spirits raise,

137
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,729
you murdering, conniving,
thieving cocksucker.

138
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,280
Resourceful and resolute,

139
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:44,110
a vital part of the new-made
State of south Dakota,

140
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,911
and this State,

141
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,660
a vital part of our fine country.

142
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,831
Amen to that!

143
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,922
Thank you, Senator                       !

144
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,937
Hotel's but two rooms short
of fully-occupied, Trixie,

145
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:15,024
with the parade yet
still in full swing.

146
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:18,603
Congratulations then, Mr. Starr,
to you and Marshal Bullock.

147
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:23,657
Maybe Mark the moment
braining me with a fucking brick!

148
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:25,864
I'd sooner put a ring on your finger.

149
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,826
Once first we've seen
does the baby survive.

150
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:33,580
That being, in your scripture,
matrimony's single reason and purpose.

151
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:36,879
Ain't we already awash in the miracle

152
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,799
of a whore of my vintage
being pregnant at all?

153
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:42,669
Why not wear a sign, then?

154
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,841
Dress in red, head to toe?

155
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:49,846
Please, Trixie.
You oughtn't show your face outside.

156
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:53,016
Lemonade's on its way
with chips of ice, how you like.

157
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,810
Rest now.

158
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,937
I just got the fuck up.

159
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,195
Rest.

160
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,800
Senator !
Senator !

161
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,344
Murdering motherless cocksucker.

162
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,727
Oh, Senator Hearst! Your honor!

163
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:25,901
Yoo-hoo!

164
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:29,525
On this 10th anniversary
of them being butchered,

165
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,532
I convey to you, Senator                       ,
memorial greetings

166
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:34,955
from the miner Ellsworth and prostitute Jen,

167
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,081
- but two of the who knows how many...
- Hold it!

168
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,879
You've done for
while making your moneyed progress!

169
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:46,801
Have I missed word of your appointment
to some position of authority?

170
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:51,005
Have I missed word of yours,
you bald-pated cunt?

171
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:03,592
Better watch yourself, Senator                       !

172
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:04,696
Mr. Hearst                     ?

173
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:13,573
For ain't it so, Sir                                      .

174
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:16,038
It's the thieving and throat-cutting,

175
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,956
them's bloodied and dead in the mud,

176
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,999
it still stiffens the member
in your long Johns!

177
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,828
Why not press forward,
for Christ's sake?

178
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:24,379
Set herself a flame?

179
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,838
Nor, ought I fail to remark

180
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:30,010
the semblance from this vantage twixt

181
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:33,385
your very mug and a snatch
has gone haired over sideways.

182
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,805
Mayor Farnum! It's a...

183
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,180
Trixie hasn't lost her gift.

184
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:39,682
She ain't for a fact.

185
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:41,931
Time can't touch that.

186
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,393
Slimy cocksucker slither his way
into our camp's inner workings!

187
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:48,194
And aren't you the vile bodying

188
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:51,524
of a gutter-mouth
trollop and tramp! Go.

189
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:53,904
- As you are of a murdering shit-heel!
- Now.

190
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:54,996
Trixie!

191
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,413
What's left still to do, Trixie?

192
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,209
Pitch yourself down the stairs?

193
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,621
End any chance of our
child's well-being?

194
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:10,918
Jesus wept! “What is it?

195
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,846
Something amiss
that you fucking foresaw.

196
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,346
Ready for the Doc, we are?

197
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,765
- Off you go then, to fetch him.
- Okay.

198
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,477
I'll be good.

199
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,271
Marshal!

200
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:34,282
Mr. Utter!

201
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,364
- Hello.
- Hello, girls.

202
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:39,784
- Greetings from uncle Charlie.
- Uncle Charlie!

203
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,991
It's lovely to see you both again.

204
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:43,667
Mrs. Bullock,

205
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:46,837
I remember
your reading lessons so well.

206
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:51,834
Ms. Ellsworth here
and her daughter, they need a room.

207
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,507
I told them the best hotel
in town's right there.

208
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,632
Perhaps installing
Mrs. Ellsworth in a suite

209
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:01,264
would be the considerate thing
for the hotel's owner to do?

210
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,765
Yes, it would.

211
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,997
Mrs. Ellsworth,
was there a room available?

212
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:26,535
It seems we've secured
the very last one.

213
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,084
Must be my lucky day.

214
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:31,130
I'll walk you upstairs.

215
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,633
You, having so lived
in recollection, Marshal,

216
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:44,261
it is my considerable happiness
to see you again.

217
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:48,478
No less a happiness, Mrs. Ellsworth,
than is seeing you for me.

218
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:54,571
As a dream might come alive
to draw a breath.

219
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,369
Said overmuch.

220
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:11,797
Vowed I wouldn't,
but I absolutely knew I would.

221
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,800
Why didn't you write of your arrival?

222
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:18,511
Not sure.

223
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,347
I see.

224
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:29,189
I wonder, Mr. Bullock,
if all unwitting,

225
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:31,392
I may have done something
to upset an applecart.

226
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:34,478
Not at all.

227
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,776
It's a pleasure to see you both again.

228
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,081
What?

229
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,379
Nothing, mama.

230
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:58,840
Bullock! Hey, Marshal!

231
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,158
Just the man I was looking for.

232
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:02,719
Coulda warned me of
Mrs. Ellsworth's return, Charlie.

233
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,640
How the fuck
when I was surprised myself?

234
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:07,515
Very least not deposit her
in my goddamn hotel!

235
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,222
Hey, if you're finished
rapping my knuckles,

236
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,774
I got some more
manly matters to discuss.

237
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:15,819
I'm all ears, Charlie.

238
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,779
Hearst wants to buy my land.

239
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:24,369
Dangling big paydays
through third parties.

240
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:26,868
He's coming today hisself.

241
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:30,910
- Are you disposed?
- My age,

242
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:33,788
I'd be a fool not to chew on it some.

243
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,170
Which evidently,
a Bullock that looks away,

244
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:41,095
scowling like he is, don't approve of.

245
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:47,013
Utter's pal Bullock
figures if Utter sold off his land,

246
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:50,933
nothing for Utter to do
but sit wondering in that old saloon,

247
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,690
why in hell he'd sold the thing

248
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,109
he'd spent his life
getting situated to buy

249
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,732
and keep, to work it himself?

250
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:02,483
Hearst doesn't deserve
your land, Charlie.

251
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,864
Nor ought I either fall
to bring to mind

252
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,412
the bastard's disposition
to foul play.

253
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:14,919
Before negotiations commence,

254
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,089
would I be outta place
calling on Hearst myself?

255
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:21,176
I wonder, too, might you
procure me an infant's linen?

256
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,721
And you don't make a friend
a stranger, Charlie,

257
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:27,174
declining walking beside you.

258
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:30,560
Saying first, my being grateful

259
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:33,559
and heartily appreciative,

260
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,392
I'd hold with your friend
best achieving

261
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:40,145
his purposes toting his water hisself.

262
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,868
Join us for dinner tonight.

263
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,826
You amaze my boy
pulling coins from your ears.

264
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,534
Better trick would be me pulling
Hears's hundreds out my ass.

265
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,540
Expect you seven o’clock, uncle Charlie.

266
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,456
Thanks, Bullock, for the lookout.

267
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,733
Good morning, miss newly-arrived!

268
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,360
Might you be
the establishment's operator?

269
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:26,567
Named Al.

270
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,527
Swearengen's the remainder,

271
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,910
if you ain't overmuch gave pause to
the various ins and outs.

272
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:35,876
My name's Caroline Woolgarden,
Mr. Swearengen, which I imagine

273
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:38,202
don't slide easy off the tongue
any more than yours does.

274
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:42,666
Caroline Woolgarden, like butter.

275
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:46,007
Come new to town in hope
of renting one of your fine rooms.

276
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,133
Ah!

277
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:53,309
Shit bird in prospect.

278
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:56,350
Would you excuse me, Ms. Woolgarden?

279
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,942
Produce George Hearst Esquire,

280
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:08,241
colossus of commerce,
junior Senator from California,

281
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,740
who since our paths last crossed

282
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:14,824
has went from strength
to stronger strength still.

283
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:20,003
Even as you name me,

284
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,174
a figure to be reckoned with
in this camp, Mr. Swearengen,

285
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:27,048
I have been made this morning,

286
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,130
more than somewhat,

287
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,260
to look an incompetent.

288
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:35,222
You, Sir?

289
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:38,142
An incompetent?
Now, how would that ever be?

290
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:42,776
These years now past, I'd have you
recall my having been attacked.

291
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,649
Shot, and near as not,
done in by a whore,

292
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:51,034
whose name, if I ever knew it,

293
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,453
has now been lost to me.

294
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,330
I dimly recall the matter.

295
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:59,706
The nameless whore embarked
on a program of vengeance,

296
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,208
and by god, she nearly brought off.

297
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,665
Referring to her attempt to murder me.

298
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,375
Not to pretty the picture.

299
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,092
I have lived believing
the matter had been settled.

300
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,596
And I was satisfied in that belief.

301
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:19,138
But now, I realize I was tricked.

302
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,316
The whore you presented in the box
was not the shooter at all.

303
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:30,073
You're going for the long,
larger-minded view, Senator                       .

304
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:34,202
Which depends on running
telephone lines across the claims,

305
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:37,243
on recognizing common ground,

306
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:38,949
bringing the future to it.

307
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:41,289
A brief illustration of my point...

308
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:44,128
Does brevity exist in
your repertoire, Sir                                      ?

309
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:52,629
I am making an offer
on Charlie Utter's land.

310
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,142
Lumber for construction
arrived this morning.

311
00:21:57,854 --> 00:21:59,970
Confident, are we?

312
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:03,640
Back my bid
for buying up Utter's property,

313
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,811
use your position in the town
to sway others,

314
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:15,035
the pregnant whore who attacked me.

315
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,863
Uncharacteristically
straightforward, Sir                                      .

316
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:25,371
Discover your deepest nature,
Mr. Swearengen.

317
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,838
Walk with the future.

318
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:40,396
How'd that do you, Al?

319
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:42,429
Good like it seemed?

320
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:46,605
Best time to produce Trixie, so,
I can sell her on silence as virtue.

321
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,277
On it, boss.

322
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,494
Go ahead, go ahead.

323
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,752
Christ, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

324
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:08,083
They're arrayed to support you,
Ms. Trixie,

325
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:10,085
but you're the one
who's got to be pushing!

326
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:13,464
Which don't I, in Christ,
look to be doing, aunt Lou?

327
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:16,951
Go ahead.

328
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,340
Dan Dority!

329
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,474
Speaking for Al
that needs words with Trixie!

330
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:21,802
Trixie ain't receiving,

331
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:25,185
hard as she's coming for home.
If you'd just tell Al,

332
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:27,891
- we'll issue word from this quarter...
- Come on, come on.

333
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:29,567
As we are fucking able!

334
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:32,107
Okay. I hear you, Doc.

335
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:36,320
One more push,
Trixie. This is it.

336
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,672
Now, we doing something.
And...

337
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:41,832
Now we doing it.

338
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,452
Okay.

339
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:45,204
See his business?

340
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,500
You got a boy!

341
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:48,669
A boy.

342
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,423
Go ahead, and slap his backside.

343
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:57,712
- There we go.
- There we go.

344
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,891
Oh, Trixie.

345
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:03,555
Hello, Joshua.

346
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:06,930
Lord keep you.

347
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,272
Ms. Calamity Jane Cannary.

348
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:13,479
Charlie Utter.

349
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:16,231
Some putting odds up
train bring you home in a box.

350
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:19,158
I come to collect Joanie Stubbs.

351
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,581
Oh, God.

352
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,674
How would you describe the Stubbs
woman's State of affairs?

353
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:36,918
Not seeing her consistent,

354
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:40,676
I say Joanie Stubbs is
collecting her portion of

355
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,349
gloom and dismay, just like any of us.

356
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:48,805
Well, suppose...
Suppose, Charlie...

357
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:54,399
Say, a person
had interest in that situation,

358
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:55,572
what, by your lights,

359
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:57,537
would be the right way
of broaching the subject?

360
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:00,150
I'd maybe say...

361
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:03,695
You been thinking of her,

362
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:08,246
hoping if ever she thought of you,

363
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:11,661
her thinking would be friendly, too.

364
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:15,540
Write me that down to repeat it,
you cocksucker.

365
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,209
You know what to say, Jane.

366
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:19,722
What to do.

367
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:22,589
I will stand you to a drink.

368
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,055
Down along with you, too,
far as that goes.

369
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,102
- One drink.
- Fuck one drink.

370
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,272
Go find your girl.

371
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:32,975
Go get her.

372
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,120
I'd have a word,

373
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,537
either with management,

374
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:52,164
or just some girl
ain't on her back just now,

375
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:53,495
legs straight up in the air!

376
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:57,507
If you want the boss,
Joanie's upstairs.

377
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:58,674
Oh?

378
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:00,846
Busy?

379
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:04,426
- I didn't see.
- No, we didn't see.

380
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:42,669
Jane Cannary come a-calling,
Ms. Stubbs.

381
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,922
I'd be grateful
if you'd hold your fire.

382
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:55,439
Everyone got plenty of room?

383
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:58,772
Seem to be making do.

384
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:03,315
Why don't me and Deenie
just get outta here, Joanie?

385
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,326
We don't want no trouble.

386
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:09,533
Well arrived, Jane.

387
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,953
- Welcome home.
- Go fuck yourself.

388
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:15,831
Hold her soap!

389
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:32,594
Considerable time since seeing you.

390
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:36,556
Wasn't me setting off to see
the country, see the world.

391
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:39,484
Weren't we sure as fuck done
with each other back then.

392
00:27:39,612 --> 00:27:42,354
Not on my say-so.

393
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,825
Well, go on. Say what you wanna say.

394
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:00,129
Just surprised
to find you back here is all.

395
00:28:01,092 --> 00:28:04,801
I'd be grateful keeping opinions
to yourself concerning

396
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,760
my whereabouts and purposes.

397
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:09,430
You wanna brawl, we can do it.

398
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:13,468
Brawling's unseemly, girl my age.

399
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:17,014
Charlie Utter said you been better.

400
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,442
Is that right? Charlie did?

401
00:28:25,658 --> 00:28:28,274
High on dope,
as I suppose you'd have to be,

402
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:30,701
consorting with them miserable cunts.

403
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:35,365
New old damn shooter coming out.

404
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,327
Believe the game shut down
when she left the table.

405
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:10,321
These placer acres that you own,
Mr. Utter,

406
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:11,867
captured my attention.

407
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:15,205
Scouts you sent
previous made that clear.

408
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,117
People whose judgment I respect

409
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:23,463
assay this property's market value
at $3,500.

410
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:30,670
Seems I'm the lone holdout
for the path of progress.

411
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:36,843
By way of abbreviating
our back and forth,

412
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:39,179
and maybe generating some goodwill,

413
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:42,940
I'd go $500 above.

414
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:44,817
Offer you

415
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:47,729
$4,000 even, cash money.

416
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:58,205
My father taught his boy,

417
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:02,127
beat hell into him
might maybe be more accurate,

418
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:05,797
how if early enough on,

419
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,875
you credited the settlements
that was coming,

420
00:30:10,346 --> 00:30:13,304
bought acres reasonable,

421
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,347
developed them sensible,

422
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:19,348
hung onto 'em
until the market come right,

423
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:22,101
of a day
you might could wake up and find

424
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:25,187
you made yourself
a respectable investment.

425
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:28,895
Forward thinking
was your father, then.

426
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,903
And now, here's his boy
to confirm his papa's prediction.

427
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:36,069
Contrariwise,

428
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,534
man might could

429
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,917
come to certain special feelings.

430
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:47,000
Partial, say, to a piece of ground.

431
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:50,129
A river,

432
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,086
bending through the forest like so.

433
00:31:02,482 --> 00:31:04,689
I'll decline your offer, Mr. Hearst,

434
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:09,443
thanking you
for your time and attention.

435
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:18,741
My experience over time
has come to be,

436
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:24,075
customarily, I am he
who starts a negotiation.

437
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:26,869
Names its finish, too.

438
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:32,250
Maybe getting mother fucked
this morning

439
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:35,553
in the thoroughfare by a woman,
in the bargain,

440
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,177
has somewhat got your back up.

441
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:42,936
Not the accolade you look for
out your return to fucking camp.

442
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:47,975
Proffering that assessment, Sir,
is hardly your proper bailiwick.

443
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:51,690
Far as that, I went and proffered it
any fucking way.

444
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:17,087
Any soul on the grounds bearing mortal
likeness to a walrus,

445
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:19,096
raise up your right hand, or whistle.

446
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:21,758
You, Tom Nuttall!

447
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,551
Up with your right,

448
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:25,727
or purse your damn lips and blow!

449
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:30,604
Pitiful effort.

450
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,152
Welcome home, Jane.

451
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,230
'Scription to propose.

452
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,732
Tombstone above a casket.

453
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:41,118
"On this spot"

454
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:47,283
"was Bill Hickok" foully slayed,

455
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:49,710
"brains blown to bits..."

456
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,460
"By the coward Jack McCall!

457
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,926
"Neath this building, too,

458
00:32:57,513 --> 00:33:01,926
"days to come,
"will rest the remains of.

459
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:04,851
"Jane Ardis Cannary,"

460
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:08,767
"known as 'Calamity' to strangers,"

461
00:33:08,858 --> 00:33:10,689
"and to Bill Hickok"

462
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:14,815
"as a very good friend."

463
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:20,157
"At the place of his sorrowful demise,"

464
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:25,159
"may Jane's spirit
stand vigilante watch,"

465
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:28,116
"as in life she found herself unable."

466
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:32,124
And to speak straightforward, Jane,

467
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:34,171
you mortally installed

468
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,292
and decaying 'neath this building

469
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:40,093
don't strike me
as a magnet for commerce.

470
00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:42,680
Because you're headless
for business, Tom,

471
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:45,675
and heedless and horse-faced to boot!

472
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,477
Well, why not empty the graveyards?

473
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:50,930
Spot corpses at the tables,

474
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,562
needling the gloom overall.

475
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,525
That's a rotten idea.

476
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:58,609
Fuck yourself, Artie.

477
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:09,866
What are you selling, Wu?

478
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:11,417
Swedgin.

479
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:12,664
You.

480
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:15,504
He has medicine for you.

481
00:34:18,844 --> 00:34:21,085
Your color looks wrong.

482
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,309
Mengyao, you for hire?

483
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:29,935
Yes, Mr. Swedgin.

484
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,013
Good.

485
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,692
I want you to take this note

486
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:38,861
to Sol Star
to give to his lady, Trixie,

487
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:42,774
over at the Bullock Star Hotel
over the road there.

488
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:47,828
- You got that?
- How much will you pay me?

489
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:49,538
Hmm...

490
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,959
Payment upon return,
and job verified complete.

491
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:01,334
Now, go wait outside the door
for your Grandad.

492
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:06,808
Oh, yeah.

493
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:14,226
Swedgin. Drink. Tea.

494
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,732
You drink tea.

495
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:18,733
No! No!

496
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,441
I'll cut your chink throat for a "no,"

497
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,568
and pitch you off the balcony
with the other one,

498
00:35:23,826 --> 00:35:25,987
seek health advice on the way down.

499
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:31,368
Fucking Wu.

500
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,209
Go on, get back to your fucking alley!

501
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:47,964
Fucking tea, huh?

502
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:13,118
Am I doing something wrong?

503
00:36:16,295 --> 00:36:18,456
You gimme the fantods, you're so

504
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:20,917
favoring a girl who once worked here.

505
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:23,715
Is she thick through the calf like me?

506
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:25,345
She was pretty.

507
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:31,424
She had the yellowest hair.
Just the sweetest damn smile.

508
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,846
She had a chip, she had...

509
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,930
There, right there,
like to drive a fellow crazy.

510
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:41,149
Me at least, anyway.

511
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:46,313
Jen, her name was.

512
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:48,657
Did Jen move along?

513
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,155
She did.

514
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Moved on.

515
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,040
Give you word where?

516
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:09,469
I weren't telling you true, Caroline.

517
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,140
She died.

518
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:16,302
Jen did.

519
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,395
Just poor luck...

520
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:28,523
Caught in the middle of a situation
none of her fucking doing.

521
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:33,410
Exceptional sweet
soul, minister said.

522
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:34,953
And he weren't wrong.

523
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:42,954
Appears my job's in progress
before we might even get to set down.

524
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:49,335
Early uprising
longtime trial to me.

525
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,301
More than an hour late is Charlie.

526
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:01,851
Maybe I pressed too hard about Hearst.

527
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,316
Perhaps he got involved
catching up with folks.

528
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:10,196
I should feed the children.

529
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:17,409
Going to look out for Charlie.

530
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:28,670
Evening, Marshal!

531
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:30,376
Looking for Charlie Utter, Jane.

532
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,879
I ain't seen him tonight.

533
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:36,181
Do something for me?
Check around town.

534
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:39,351
If you find Charlie, tell him
my wife's angry at his bad behavior.

535
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:41,182
Count on it!

536
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:42,934
Harry, with me.

537
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:44,811
My gout's agitating.

538
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,255
- Should I take one of the young ones?
- Yes, Sir                                      .

539
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,736
- I'll fucking go with you, Bullock.
- No! No!

540
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,815
I'm up! I'm up.

541
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:13,256
That's Charlie's horse.

542
00:39:14,014 --> 00:39:16,005
Start over there.

543
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,368
Careful now.

544
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:56,337
How long you standing out here?

545
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:59,174
Better part of my fucking life,
feels like.

546
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:04,012
You looking for Charlie Utter
with me, or not?

547
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:06,893
He sometimes plays cards
at this new place.

548
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:11,318
Only knowed that 'cause I teased
him never frequentin' this joint.

549
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:13,111
Lead the way, then.

550
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:19,287
Charlie?

551
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,166
Charlie Utter!

552
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Charlie!

553
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:36,767
Come out, hands where I can see 'em.

554
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,670
Don't you shoot.

555
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:44,051
What are you doing out here, Samuel?

556
00:40:44,146 --> 00:40:46,637
I'm just reaching for my fishing pole,

557
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:50,186
and I'm asking you not to kill me.

558
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:54,646
Christ. Charlie!

559
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:57,489
It weren't me, no Sir                                      !

560
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,658
What the fuck you talking about?

561
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:01,360
Bullock!

562
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:12,455
Jesus God in Heaven.

563
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:17,421
Get him a blanket, Harry.

564
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:20,004
- I didn't do it, Marshal...
- Be still.

565
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:20,731
I'd appreciate Mr. Hearst knowing
I'm waiting to talk to him.

566
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:23,154
Mr. Utter!
That can't be!

567
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:30,574
Covered in blood!

568
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:53,431
Charlie Utter's dead, Mr. Hearst.

569
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,065
Murdered.

570
00:42:56,195 --> 00:43:00,780
Do we know by whose hand, Marshal,
Mr. Utter has been taken?

571
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:02,241
Who pulled the trigger,

572
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,574
put the fucking money up
to get it done.

573
00:43:04,703 --> 00:43:08,070
I take that, Sir, as a slur

574
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,247
meant to incite me.

575
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,451
And I do not choose to be provoked.

576
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:17,371
Your imputing foreknowledge, Sir,

577
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:20,708
to me of Mr. Utter's murder exposes me

578
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:24,170
to shameful slander and disesteem.

579
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,465
I will have you recant.

580
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:29,933
Or either ready to receive

581
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,137
behavior from me in rebuke.

582
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:41,938
What form then do you figure
your rebuke will take,

583
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:45,069
murdering cunt that you are?

584
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:47,909
- Bullock...
- I'll get to you in a fucking minute.

585
00:43:58,298 --> 00:43:59,378
Charlie Utter.

586
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:02,590
Have a thought for a good man dead.

587
00:44:09,726 --> 00:44:12,638
Shut the place down! Bar's closed!

588
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:15,054
Go on, get the fuck outta here!

589
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:25,614
I'd learn the import of that look
passed 'twixt you and fucking Hearst                     .

590
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:28,408
Get the Marshal a whiskey.

591
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,246
I don't want a fucking drink.

592
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,759
Say, Bullock, a fella not many hours
left to order his affairs,

593
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:52,808
applied them that remain, naming such
purposes that he'd give primacy.

594
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:55,394
Deal me in or don't, al.

595
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,347
I'd not be fucked halfway up.

596
00:45:04,114 --> 00:45:08,198
Hearst stopped by,
wanted to bury the hatchet.

597
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:12,324
Pool revenue and influence
in exchange for Trixie's life.

598
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:16,373
Planning to run telephone wires
across Utter's property.

599
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:20,039
Lumber lies at his claim.

600
00:45:20,172 --> 00:45:22,584
Him conveying that to you,
you said fucking what?

601
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:26,625
- I let the offer sit.
- To what fucking end?

602
00:45:30,682 --> 00:45:34,174
You ever think, Bullock,
of not going straight at a thing?

603
00:45:36,021 --> 00:45:37,021
No.

604
00:45:40,817 --> 00:45:43,149
What's the move, Al?

605
00:45:44,404 --> 00:45:46,269
Wish to fuck I knew.

606
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:51,818
Killing Charlie Utter
changes the game.

607
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,199
Say a man has an eyewitness
to bring to bear.

608
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:01,504
Name him.

609
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:04,128
Samuel Fields.

610
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:07,374
The nigger general was
an eyewitness to what?

611
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,923
Eyewitness to them
as did for Charlie Utter.

612
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,593
And thereby need
a good fucking murdering.

613
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:17,930
Sidestepping legal administration.

614
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:19,727
If it ain't for Hearst to follow the law,

615
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,351
why the fuck should it be for you?

616
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:28,229
Now, how should I construe that look
on your mug, Bullock?

617
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,566
My job ain't to follow the law, Al.

618
00:46:32,744 --> 00:46:35,326
My job is to interpret it,

619
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:38,451
then enforce it accordingly.

620
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:46,546
You best counsel your partner proper.

621
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,798
The safety of the mother and child.

622
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,464
Sol and me'll see to it.

623
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:52,920
Hearst won't take long

624
00:46:53,265 --> 00:46:56,132
before he honors the rigors
of his putrid fucking nature.

625
00:46:56,643 --> 00:46:58,474
He'll want an answer.

626
00:47:01,606 --> 00:47:03,847
I'll deliver your fucking answer.

627
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,052
Fucking telephone in my joint.

628
00:47:40,395 --> 00:47:43,728
Saloon is a sanctuary.

629
00:47:43,815 --> 00:47:48,104
Every man worth the name
knows the value of being unreachable.

630
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,649
Will you have me suck your prick now,
Mr. Swearengen?

631
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,948
What has changed since early
when I declined the offer?

632
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:58,493
Do I look suddenly robust,
unimpededly erect?

633
00:47:58,663 --> 00:48:00,699
I am out, as I told you,

634
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,407
of sorts, commission, activity.

635
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:04,687
And more and more forgetful

636
00:48:04,711 --> 00:48:08,249
what the whole sordid fucking business
is to signify.

637
00:48:09,132 --> 00:48:11,043
Plenty I wouldn't mind forgetting.

638
00:48:23,522 --> 00:48:25,808
Hey, come over here. Come on.

639
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:33,986
You dropped this earlier.

640
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:39,239
Real or not, I value it high.

641
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:44,324
That is a goddamn gold commemorative
worth $12 to $14.

642
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:52,752
Can I ask who the woman was earlier
today, yelling from the hotel balcony?

643
00:48:54,344 --> 00:48:56,175
One who ain't afraid to die.

644
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,970
And who you'd see live?

645
00:48:59,057 --> 00:49:02,049
Well, that's the question.
When I'm gone, who'll protect her?

646
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:05,352
Can the Jew do what needs to be done?
Can Bullock?

647
00:49:07,732 --> 00:49:09,268
Oh, Christ, save me.

648
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:11,186
Have I feelings for her?

649
00:49:13,947 --> 00:49:18,737
Am I that fucking lost a cunt,
a man my age?

650
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,572
Makes me wanna weep,

651
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:23,532
how you remind me of my dad.

652
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:28,159
Don't you hang your relations
around my neck.

653
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:44,341
It's a sad night.

654
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:49,057
Something's afire.

655
00:49:51,943 --> 00:49:52,943
Christ.

656
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:57,062
I do have feelings.

657
00:50:13,048 --> 00:50:14,254
Hyah!

658
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,630
Charlie Utter.

659
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,636
So much to
rounding up Trixie for me.

660
00:51:09,396 --> 00:51:13,560
Last night, you sent little Wu
with a notion to abstain!

661
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,650
Did I, now?

662
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:18,773
Doc is not 100% all the way to the top

663
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,716
persuaded that you oughta be
up and about just yet.

664
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,402
Doc's got a call
to his own fucking opinion,

665
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:25,905
but not to be blabbing

666
00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:29,864
about what pertains or ain't
to my fucking plans, huh?

667
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,745
Fucking drenched.

668
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:35,994
What are you doing up, Al?

669
00:51:36,548 --> 00:51:39,039
Well, this is fucking pain
in the balls.

670
00:51:41,136 --> 00:51:42,467
Jesus Christ!

671
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,428
I owe Charlie Utter
a sending off, Doc.

672
00:51:49,561 --> 00:51:51,552
Oh, god damn it, Al.

673
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:54,815
Okay.

674
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:56,692
Hey, Dan!

675
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:58,357
You do it, huh?

676
00:51:59,154 --> 00:52:00,940
Handful of dirt from each of us?

677
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:04,568
Charlie Utter.

678
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:09,487
You got to walk it by yourself

679
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:11,367
there's nobody else...

680
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:13,418
Mr. Utter's accustomed
to letting me cross

681
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,996
his land and fish the stream

682
00:52:15,086 --> 00:52:18,328
that separates his acres from Mr. Hearst.

683
00:52:18,465 --> 00:52:21,878
He come 'round about a quarter
past the second I caught,

684
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:30,553
I heard a rifle shot,
and I took the fuck off

685
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:33,685
Could you identify
the man who did it?

686
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:36,099
No, Sir, I cannot.

687
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:39,103
Because I didn't see him.

688
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:45,063
You being you?

689
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:48,032
Me being the color I am, yes, Sir                                      .

690
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,325
I wish I could.

691
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:57,079
I'am say this once to you, Marshal.

692
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,956
I'm gonna let myself hope

693
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,650
that you don't permit them
stringing me up

694
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:03,507
over something I had nothing
to do with, not fuck all.

695
00:53:03,593 --> 00:53:06,300
Nobody's trying to lynch you
at this moment here, Samuel.

696
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:10,047
And if you look at me hard,

697
00:53:10,225 --> 00:53:13,342
you'll know
they'll have to kill me down the road

698
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:14,972
before they get to do it then.

699
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:19,939
Bless you seeing clear
to say so, Marshal,

700
00:53:20,026 --> 00:53:22,358
and get me a good goddamn lawyer.

701
00:53:22,529 --> 00:53:24,736
Sorry for the lateness.
Goult's flaring.

702
00:53:24,823 --> 00:53:26,154
Was at the Doc's.

703
00:53:26,241 --> 00:53:28,698
Been hearing about your
gout a lot lately, Harry.

704
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:31,618
Pokes me like devil's in there
working with a tiny pitchfork.

705
00:53:31,705 --> 00:53:32,705
How's this going?

706
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:34,745
Get me a good goddamn lawyer, Marshal!

707
00:53:45,385 --> 00:53:51,096
I was standing on the banks

708
00:53:51,558 --> 00:53:56,643
of the river

709
00:53:57,063 --> 00:54:05,063
looking out over
life's troubled seas

710
00:54:08,658 --> 00:54:13,826
when I saw an old ship

711
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:20,909
that was sailing
is that the old...

712
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:24,337
Come on, Jane.
Time for Charlie's burial.

713
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:40,261
Remember when Bill passed?

714
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:43,856
Charlie so broke up
he'd been out the camp,

715
00:54:43,943 --> 00:54:45,399
couldn't attend the goodbye?

716
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:50,689
And I recollect, too, girl barely
could put one foot front the other,

717
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:53,571
but weren't gonna fail
to see Bill Hickok off.

718
00:54:57,123 --> 00:54:59,159
When Sol Star and I
came to this community,

719
00:55:00,919 --> 00:55:02,580
Charlie Utter

720
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,503
was first man forward
offering his hand in greeting.

721
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:10,675
Over time, Sol and I formed
a friendship with Charlie.

722
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,045
Enriched our lives.

723
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:17,849
Come up to proper,
he was good natured and just.

724
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,011
Come to anyway at all,

725
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:23,308
I never saw a man stand him down.

726
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:29,023
Only right he should be buried
on the land he worked his life for.

727
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:35,659
Charlie was took from us wrongful,
and he was...

728
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:40,113
He was took too soon.

729
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:46,662
We ask respite for a good man's soul.

730
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,922
Pray the lord carry him home.

731
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:54,840
No man never stood up
for me how Charlie did,

732
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:58,924
nor with no word
about doing it, neither.

733
00:56:01,813 --> 00:56:03,053
Amen. Amen.

734
00:56:03,147 --> 00:56:04,557
Woman: Amen to that.

735
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:28,920
Gentlemen.

736
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:30,998
Senator Hearst expecting us.

737
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:33,542
Room number nine.

738
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,217
Constituents of the cocksucker
from California?

739
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:42,301
Don't I deserve common courtesy?

740
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:47,765
May I mention services
this community's mayor,

741
00:56:47,859 --> 00:56:51,351
albeit admittedly
a largely titular position.

742
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:54,813
But facts are facts.

743
00:57:01,915 --> 00:57:05,828
Well deserved, if modest,
recognitions, gentlemen.

744
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:08,876
Jobs well done.

745
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:11,875
Well, if you call them recognitions
just modest, Mr. Hearst,

746
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:14,958
I pray to Christ we run across
you the day you're showing off.

747
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,084
Certain you were unseen?

748
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:19,338
Not a human eye for miles.

749
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:23,512
Man looks
to be losing his mind, Dennis.

750
00:57:25,521 --> 00:57:27,352
That direction. What the fuck?

751
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:33,267
I saw a fisherman at the claim

752
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:35,148
earlier in the day.

753
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:38,653
Dark-completed fellow,
wading the stream.

754
00:57:46,918 --> 00:57:50,786
You bring me to wonder aloud if that
last was a bald-faced fabrication.

755
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:55,381
My sources say Marshal's
collected a witness, for a fact.

756
00:57:57,387 --> 00:57:58,752
I paid for execution

757
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:01,804
at a level of professional excellence.

758
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:09,345
You were commissioned

759
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:12,724
to undertake of certain effort.

760
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,402
It went without saying

761
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:21,574
that you would address
any complications that might ensue.

762
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:24,570
Part of the contract, Sir, yeah.

763
00:58:25,373 --> 00:58:28,661
They have someone in custody,

764
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:33,165
which fails, by a considerable margin,
to please me.

765
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:36,339
I strongly suggest you handle it.

766
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:39,418
How the fuck are we supposed
to get into the Marshal's office?

767
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:42,174
Check on the veracity of this claim?

768
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:47,468
My sources are to be trusted,
it won't be easy.

769
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:51,433
But neither will it be impossible.

770
00:58:51,524 --> 00:58:52,809
Uh-huh.

771
00:58:53,735 --> 00:58:55,441
I see.

772
00:58:58,364 --> 00:59:00,400
This further business,

773
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:04,484
if successfully brought to fruition,
will earn each of you

774
00:59:06,122 --> 00:59:08,113
$50 additional.

775
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,457
Well, now we're talking.

776
00:59:11,627 --> 00:59:14,494
- The negro fisherman?
- That'd be a job well done.

777
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,881
Judas priest!

778
00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:32,220
A word with you, Mr. Farnum!

779
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:38,768
Property of mine
fell victim to arson last night.

780
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:41,191
So, Senator, I'm gave to understand.

781
00:59:41,282 --> 00:59:42,567
What dreadful news.

782
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:47,197
Place this lumber order.
The vendor is in lead.

783
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:51,782
Tell the man weekly deliveries
until further notice.

784
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:53,036
By telegraph, Sir?

785
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,912
There is a public telephone
just outside.

786
00:59:58,382 --> 00:59:59,872
Take the leap, Mr. Farnum.

787
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:01,832
The future awaits.

788
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:04,551
The queue, Sir, stretches.

789
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,921
Have you seen the riffraff lined up?

790
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:11,222
Stall progress, he may.
Stop it, he cannot.

791
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:16,226
Every business, Mr. Farnum,
in this territory thrives

792
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:19,775
as a direct result of communication.

793
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:22,395
Now, we've no say as to the pace

794
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,856
of modernity's advance.

795
01:00:25,076 --> 01:00:28,068
I myself am merely its vessel.

796
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:30,445
A humble foot-soldier.

797
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:33,365
Its inevitability
is the deepest truth...

798
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:35,165
What is wrong with you, god damn it,

799
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:38,165
to be shifting your feet
so incessantly?

800
01:00:38,297 --> 01:00:41,664
The procession of years,
wanton leakage.

801
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:43,841
You are a vile creature.

802
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:46,169
Nor are you first to say so.

803
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:48,884
Get the hell out and place the call.

804
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:51,432
I'll detain you
for the briefest moment.

805
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:53,510
- Now.
- Yes, Sir. Going.

806
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:05,859
Peaches, Jewel,
are for meeting of the town elders.

807
01:01:06,075 --> 01:01:07,875
This prospect here before us,
it's an auction.

808
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,071
It's hardly the same fucking thing.

809
01:01:10,163 --> 01:01:13,530
God, you think about ever
getting yourself a hobby, Dan?

810
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,602
And that smart-ass mouth
of yours is gonna get you

811
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:17,207
relegated back to the fucking kitchen.

812
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:19,899
Futile to go to Hearst this way.

813
01:01:20,298 --> 01:01:22,914
No match for his resources,
but it'd be a pity

814
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:24,840
not to recognize what's at stake.

815
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:27,259
To go ahead and die stupid.

816
01:01:27,346 --> 01:01:30,133
Hate to end a fool, right?

817
01:01:31,976 --> 01:01:35,059
Sure as hell Charlie Utter didn't.

818
01:01:35,563 --> 01:01:38,726
What's essential is you remember,
do your part.

819
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,983
Naught else, Marshal?
Laundry required?

820
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:43,977
I'll let you know.

821
01:01:45,656 --> 01:01:48,272
Where you been, Bullock?

822
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,150
Right up the fucking road, al.

823
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,497
God damn it!

824
01:02:06,802 --> 01:02:07,802
God damn it.

825
01:02:08,596 --> 01:02:10,882
My goodness. A voice?

826
01:02:11,057 --> 01:02:12,547
Hello, in there.

827
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:17,219
I'm calling the town of lead!

828
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:22,064
It's Deadwood's mayor,
E.B. Farnum, relegated to

829
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:25,393
magnate-Senator
George Hearst's errand boy,

830
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:28,859
calling lead lumber
at the Senator's behest.

831
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:34,819
The negro will lay slain
before this concludes.

832
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:38,118
Christ. I must get to Bullock.

833
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:41,329
Good afternoon

834
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:44,332
and welcome
to the Utter estates dispersal,

835
01:02:44,423 --> 01:02:48,587
as will proceed under the supervision
of the Deadwood bank.

836
01:02:48,761 --> 01:02:51,844
A description of the parcel
and its dimensions

837
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:54,468
are detailed
in the available literature.

838
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:57,470
First bids on landholdings
of Charlie Utter,

839
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,480
Deadwood bank the fiduciary,
to commence at $2,500,

840
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:06,024
increments thereafter of
$100 above the previous bid.

841
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:09,813
I'm not made for such complexity.

842
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:16,157
Who will open now
on parcel one at $2,500?

843
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:21,119
I've a bid for $2,500

844
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:24,998
on the regrettably deceased
Mr. Utter's very desirable property.

845
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:27,671
Who will go with me now to 26?

846
01:03:28,134 --> 01:03:30,341
- $2,600.
- Backing your play, partner.

847
01:03:30,428 --> 01:03:31,713
Conservative proffer.

848
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,133
$2,700.

849
01:03:35,683 --> 01:03:38,015
Upon which Hearst takes
matters by the neck.

850
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:39,517
$3,000.

851
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:44,226
Nor do I lack for stronger opinions.

852
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:48,688
- $3,100.
- 32.

853
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:51,399
Rode in, did you, Marshal,
on a Trojan horse?

854
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,157
Floor's heard $3,200.

855
01:03:55,244 --> 01:03:56,609
$3,300, please.

856
01:03:56,704 --> 01:03:59,366
34. And if you know
your limit, Marshal,

857
01:03:59,957 --> 01:04:03,290
let's hurry and get to it,
so that I may get us past,

858
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:06,869
and that we, all of us
can sup at a decent hour.

859
01:04:10,843 --> 01:04:12,674
$3,400, heard once.

860
01:04:12,928 --> 01:04:14,259
$3,500.

861
01:04:14,513 --> 01:04:16,219
Terrible fire
at your claim last night.

862
01:04:16,307 --> 01:04:18,013
Everybody whole, Senator?

863
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,559
36.

864
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:23,727
$3,700.

865
01:04:27,526 --> 01:04:28,526
38.

866
01:04:32,114 --> 01:04:33,775
$3,900.

867
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:36,656
I've $3,900 once.

868
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:46,659
Mr. Hearst sent us.

869
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:48,457
It's fucking daytime.

870
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,250
Not our fucking problem.

871
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:53,249
Say how you want it played.

872
01:04:53,344 --> 01:04:55,710
Key's on the desk,
this side of my head.

873
01:04:59,725 --> 01:05:01,716
$4,300. 44

874
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:07,180
Seth... Do I hear $4,500?

875
01:05:07,274 --> 01:05:09,481
$5,000, god damn it.

876
01:05:09,568 --> 01:05:12,059
As ought shoo the sightseers off.

877
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:14,861
- $5,500.
- 56.

878
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:18,034
$6,000.

879
01:05:18,202 --> 01:05:19,658
$6,500.

880
01:05:25,793 --> 01:05:27,374
$7,000.

881
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,750
$7,200.

882
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:39,295
$7,300.

883
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:43,257
And neither if you continue, Sir,
will you find yourself unaccompanied.

884
01:05:48,816 --> 01:05:54,231
I've $7,300
for the Utter property heard once.

885
01:05:57,408 --> 01:05:59,114
$7,300 twice.

886
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,326
Third time.

887
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:07,199
Sold to the distinguished
and resourceful Mrs. Ellsworth    ,

888
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:09,707
for $7,300!

889
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:14,716
Mrs. Ellsworth    .

890
01:06:32,693 --> 01:06:34,433
You honor Charlie today.

891
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:36,905
Bullock!

892
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:38,654
Excuse me.

893
01:06:39,283 --> 01:06:41,569
What is it, E.B.?

894
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:45,118
You're certain? Yes.

895
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:51,711
Dan.

896
01:06:53,088 --> 01:06:54,828
- With Al.
- Staying.

897
01:07:00,971 --> 01:07:01,971
No!

898
01:07:17,363 --> 01:07:18,363
Sorry.

899
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:20,313
How long ago?

900
01:07:21,283 --> 01:07:23,148
Ugh, I couldn't tell you
for mortal truth.

901
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:27,890
- They got Samuel.
- Marshal!

902
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,873
Come! Something bad is happening!
Come!

903
01:07:31,335 --> 01:07:33,542
Come! Come here!

904
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:50,180
Lemme go, the chink lives.

905
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:55,275
Mengyao!

906
01:07:56,026 --> 01:07:57,026
Mengyao!

907
01:07:57,695 --> 01:07:59,401
You gonna die if you do that.

908
01:08:00,364 --> 01:08:04,403
You arresting me for beating a coon
murdered a decent white man?

909
01:08:04,577 --> 01:08:07,694
- You murdered Charlie Utter.
- Aye? And who says so?

910
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,200
I say so.

911
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:13,991
That's him, Bullock.

912
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,206
That killed your friend.

913
01:08:31,812 --> 01:08:32,812
Seth.

914
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:36,267
Seth! Seth!

915
01:08:38,235 --> 01:08:39,235
Don't kill him!

916
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:46,659
Take care of Samuel.

917
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:50,987
Wu, feed that fuck to the pigs.

918
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:09,046
George Hearst! Come out!

919
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:22,735
George Hearst! Come out, now!

920
01:09:51,558 --> 01:09:54,550
Identify the man hired you
to do Charlie Utter's murder.

921
01:09:57,898 --> 01:09:59,889
Finally lost your grip, Marshal.

922
01:10:03,946 --> 01:10:05,436
Name the man! Go on!

923
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:09,398
Point him out.

924
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:23,704
He hired us.

925
01:10:25,884 --> 01:10:27,124
Who did?

926
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,150
Set up, Marshal, are we?

927
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:49,772
Justice and mercy in proper relation.
Feeling more a man?

928
01:10:50,576 --> 01:10:52,817
Better lock the next
shipment of lumber up.

929
01:10:54,538 --> 01:10:57,905
I expect you believe a badge
insulates you

930
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:00,995
from certain untoward consequences.

931
01:11:02,254 --> 01:11:06,338
Much as your being a U.S. Senator
will insulate you from jail.

932
01:11:08,343 --> 01:11:11,005
Tell this cocksucker
to lower his weapon!

933
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:17,341
Inside, now.

934
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:25,099
Fucking shot I am!

935
01:11:25,444 --> 01:11:26,775
You'll fucking live.

936
01:11:30,407 --> 01:11:31,613
Johnny...

937
01:11:34,495 --> 01:11:38,204
Congratulations on
the rising body count.

938
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,119
Ain't proud of it.

939
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:43,450
I'm coming for you, Marshal.

940
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:46,294
Expect you will, Senator.

941
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:08,062
Mr. Hearst ?

942
01:12:39,685 --> 01:12:41,141
Hold your son.

943
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:42,551
Rock him towards sleep.

944
01:12:42,646 --> 01:12:44,541
Feed him his milk
I've squeezed into his bottles.

945
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:46,334
Clean and change him
when he does his business.

946
01:12:46,358 --> 01:12:48,064
Wait, Trixie, where are you going?

947
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:50,642
First, Al's urgent call to see me.

948
01:12:50,737 --> 01:12:53,319
Then, he sends this note
saying the opposite.

949
01:12:56,326 --> 01:12:58,317
What the fuck, Sol?

950
01:12:58,412 --> 01:12:59,822
Not mine.

951
01:12:59,955 --> 01:13:01,741
Collateral damage is all.

952
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:03,788
Well, whose fucking blood is it?

953
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:06,413
Men who murdered Charlie, dead now.

954
01:13:06,503 --> 01:13:09,540
- Oh, the Hebrew takes to arms!
- Trixie, please calm down.

955
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,462
Then, take him.

956
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:12,790
- No.
- For God's sakes.

957
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:20,927
I'm getting Al's counsel.

958
01:13:21,184 --> 01:13:23,425
With our baby stood with his father,
20 possible minutes

959
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,226
or a fucking cunt hair more.

960
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,476
I'll exit back of the hotel,

961
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,271
sneaky as a mouse,

962
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,185
and enter the gem a sideways.

963
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:36,196
Being stupid and fucking reckless.

964
01:13:36,283 --> 01:13:38,319
As I may be both, you Jew bastard,

965
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,321
to get out the fucking door.

966
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:18,022
Beating you
about head and shoulders, lad?

967
01:14:20,994 --> 01:14:23,110
Theirs's the upper hand just now.

968
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:40,047
Some choice,
making your presence known to Hearst                     .

969
01:14:46,853 --> 01:14:48,684
Whatever trouble I caused,

970
01:14:49,898 --> 01:14:51,854
blame the baby's imminent arrival.

971
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:57,520
I took that young girl's life
to save yours.

972
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,190
Please, Al, don't say it again.

973
01:15:02,786 --> 01:15:05,027
Haunts me, Jen's face does.

974
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:08,989
Weren't you cut her throat,

975
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:13,043
nor devised a fucking plan
that nearly got us all killed.

976
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:17,338
God have mercy on me.

977
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:22,465
I don't deserve the one
fucking minute of happiness,

978
01:15:22,556 --> 01:15:24,467
my newborn gave me
coming into the world.

979
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:27,391
We chose you, you loopy cunt.

980
01:15:27,477 --> 01:15:29,263
Look at the fucking mess
you've give us.

981
01:15:29,354 --> 01:15:31,140
I'm un-fucking-worthy, al!

982
01:15:32,524 --> 01:15:34,981
I belonged in that coffin, not her!

983
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:39,607
If your aim was to die, please,
allow me to do the honors.

984
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,782
We're all of us haunted by
our own fucking thoughts.

985
01:15:50,876 --> 01:15:54,710
So, make friends with her ghost,
it ain't going fucking anywhere.

986
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:14,642
I'm sorry

987
01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:17,318
for everything.

988
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:21,228
Heavens open up.

989
01:16:21,656 --> 01:16:23,692
She expresses contrition.

990
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:39,204
New baby in camp?

991
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,503
Lovely little boy.

992
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:50,223
As born of his mother, he would be.

993
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:58,086
Did you try and stop her from leaving?

994
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:00,317
- Nothing I could do.
- Jesus Christ.

995
01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:06,948
Swearengen's the only one I told
Samuel is in the cage.

996
01:17:08,078 --> 01:17:11,616
Man may be a lot of things,
but he's not a snitch.

997
01:17:11,706 --> 01:17:15,290
State he's in, more likely fucking
forgot the conversation entirely.

998
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:24,670
Too much to ask
you stay the hell outta trouble?

999
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:30,305
No, fucking Bullock.

1000
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:32,181
Not too much.

1001
01:17:34,813 --> 01:17:35,813
I will.

1002
01:17:45,907 --> 01:17:47,522
Not himself, Al weren't.

1003
01:17:49,953 --> 01:17:51,318
Weak like I never seen him.

1004
01:17:53,665 --> 01:17:55,997
Gather some things now.

1005
01:17:56,877 --> 01:18:00,165
We're spending the night
at the Bullock house.

1006
01:18:00,338 --> 01:18:02,044
Moving us from the center of town.

1007
01:18:04,509 --> 01:18:05,999
I ain't running from him, Sol.

1008
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:08,669
For our boy.

1009
01:18:22,736 --> 01:18:24,476
What are the odds
of him coming to?

1010
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:33,027
He's severely injured
from the beating.

1011
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:34,736
Spleen's ruptured.

1012
01:18:35,999 --> 01:18:37,660
Blood in his belly.

1013
01:18:38,251 --> 01:18:39,741
Odds on it ending?

1014
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,622
All bleeding stops eventually.

1015
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:11,819
We ought marry on the morrow, Sol.

1016
01:19:14,371 --> 01:19:16,362
Al ain't to be relied on to linger.

1017
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:25,212
And we ain't exchanging
secret fucking vows,

1018
01:19:25,298 --> 01:19:26,788
tucked away in hiding.

1019
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:32,385
Free all day.

1020
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,255
Oh, Lord.

1021
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:21,642
Oh, well done.

1022
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:25,097
Proud performance.

1023
01:20:25,191 --> 01:20:27,182
Fucking pissed myself.

1024
01:20:28,903 --> 01:20:30,484
Argh!

1025
01:20:44,961 --> 01:20:47,293
Twenty minutes going forward
to the ceremony,

1026
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,372
nor neither
the same interval afterwards,

1027
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:52,549
no fornication on the premises.

1028
01:21:01,394 --> 01:21:02,884
Why does she get to hold him?

1029
01:21:04,814 --> 01:21:07,521
Because I'm the bride,
and it's my special fucking day.

1030
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:11,650
Lend fucking hands, girls!

1031
01:21:13,573 --> 01:21:15,655
Make the place presentable.

1032
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:18,153
May make that girl my wife.

1033
01:21:19,162 --> 01:21:22,654
She ain't gonna marry no man
age enough to be her daddy.

1034
01:21:22,832 --> 01:21:24,948
Soft hands smoothed my brow.

1035
01:21:25,043 --> 01:21:27,125
Wrists smelling like Jasmine.

1036
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:31,205
She sewed the hole in my shoulder
closed with a needle and thread.

1037
01:21:31,883 --> 01:21:33,623
Lift your wallet while she's doing it?

1038
01:21:33,927 --> 01:21:35,838
That's a dark view of the world, Dan.

1039
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:41,764
I ask to be enlightened
as to the passage of spirit

1040
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:43,842
in prospect for me, Doc.

1041
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,733
I take us to be collections of cells,

1042
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:56,735
each aggregate a smaller,
separate life inside us,

1043
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:00,317
and time slows.

1044
01:22:01,996 --> 01:22:03,987
And finally stops.

1045
01:22:06,376 --> 01:22:09,914
The fate my cell collections
live into as we speak.

1046
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:14,710
That ain't so
to a mortal certainty, Al.

1047
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:22,010
I'd not prolong the chewing up, Doc,
nor the being spat out.

1048
01:22:22,142 --> 01:22:23,848
Not go out a cunt.

1049
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:27,639
It's the dispatch I find inglorious.

1050
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:31,314
The whole delusory
fucking self-importance.

1051
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:38,070
Is it your hope to attend the wedding?

1052
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:40,149
It's my resolve.

1053
01:22:40,243 --> 01:22:41,483
All right, then.

1054
01:22:44,122 --> 01:22:45,237
Pucker up.

1055
01:22:54,632 --> 01:22:55,838
I'll take him.

1056
01:22:58,261 --> 01:23:00,047
Believe you were born to be a whore?

1057
01:23:02,515 --> 01:23:04,551
Probably doing what I'm fit for.

1058
01:23:04,642 --> 01:23:06,507
How hard you suppose
the bastard turned you out

1059
01:23:06,603 --> 01:23:08,343
had to work to make you think that?

1060
01:23:12,984 --> 01:23:14,064
Trixie.

1061
01:23:15,195 --> 01:23:16,685
Got an appointment upstairs.

1062
01:23:26,831 --> 01:23:31,200
Oh, well, I hope you're proud,
expelling your sneeze in my mug.

1063
01:23:33,296 --> 01:23:36,459
That's the Lord's blessing
come upon you, Al.

1064
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:38,540
That's him leaning down
to kiss your cheek.

1065
01:23:38,635 --> 01:23:39,635
Yeah.

1066
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:50,515
Well, I ain't got no time left
for fancy dancing.

1067
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:54,146
Your thoughts on me
leaving you the joint?

1068
01:24:00,448 --> 01:24:04,908
Though not being either to say
you have to run women,

1069
01:24:04,994 --> 01:24:07,531
I strongly endorse that...

1070
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:09,453
Make it a dance hall for all of me.

1071
01:24:14,462 --> 01:24:18,580
What about the circus elephants, Al,
producing some novel effect?

1072
01:24:18,716 --> 01:24:21,628
Dance hall, Trixie, ain't a bad idea.

1073
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:23,843
Good man you got there!

1074
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,546
Heart, soul,

1075
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:29,599
and brains enough to
know that he struck lucky

1076
01:24:29,686 --> 01:24:31,802
in his female companion.

1077
01:24:31,896 --> 01:24:34,603
Good example for the kid to emulate.

1078
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:38,141
And no fee for the sermon.

1079
01:24:38,987 --> 01:24:40,477
Excuse me now.

1080
01:24:45,702 --> 01:24:46,702
Hey.

1081
01:24:51,249 --> 01:24:53,956
Maybe you oughta think about
running for office?

1082
01:24:54,043 --> 01:24:57,285
Outnumbered, as we are, by shit-birds.

1083
01:25:00,717 --> 01:25:02,708
Food for thought, Mr.Swearengen.

1084
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:07,596
That idea is my wedding gift to you.

1085
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:10,017
Thank you.

1086
01:25:56,522 --> 01:25:58,012
Heard you was down here.

1087
01:26:04,155 --> 01:26:06,441
This one was Charlie's.

1088
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,868
Yours, now. Sure he'd want that.

1089
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,711
Past when I took what cy gave me,

1090
01:26:28,805 --> 01:26:30,341
I'd pray I wouldn't wake up.

1091
01:26:33,935 --> 01:26:37,098
You gutless cunt.
Don't you speak that way to me again.

1092
01:26:38,356 --> 01:26:41,689
Nor neither am I saying I feel
that way now, is my point.

1093
01:26:41,776 --> 01:26:42,891
You...

1094
01:26:43,903 --> 01:26:45,439
Gimme a goddamn kiss and say,

1095
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:49,193
"I promise I won't fold,
no matter how sad I get."

1096
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:51,570
Or just don't say a word at all, then.

1097
01:26:51,661 --> 01:26:53,541
Just go ahead gimme a kiss
and don't say a word.

1098
01:27:05,508 --> 01:27:06,588
Ohl

1099
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:12,345
all right, well.

1100
01:27:13,933 --> 01:27:17,892
You bring to recollection
you're a hell of a good kisser.

1101
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:21,016
And you're still chewing
that licorice?

1102
01:27:21,774 --> 01:27:24,891
That's my 12th least worst scent.

1103
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:29,692
Time comes,
I have $14,057 in the mattress,

1104
01:27:29,782 --> 01:27:32,194
which you will divide equally.

1105
01:27:32,285 --> 01:27:36,073
You fight amongst yourselves,
you will wish there was no hell

1106
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:39,531
because I will surely come back
and cut your fucking throats.

1107
01:27:40,668 --> 01:27:42,659
Well, I don't want your money.
Yeah...

1108
01:27:44,964 --> 01:27:45,964
There.

1109
01:27:47,216 --> 01:27:48,456
Gentlemen,

1110
01:27:49,635 --> 01:27:52,126
can we not appear as quadruplets?

1111
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:19,491
Bless you for being upright,

1112
01:28:19,582 --> 01:28:23,120
for letting me have
my hand on your arm,

1113
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:25,918
and for being
the showing up sort that you are.

1114
01:28:30,134 --> 01:28:31,874
What's else is gravy.

1115
01:28:57,703 --> 01:29:00,194
Safe passage to us all.

1116
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,449
Oh, you're a picture, miss.

1117
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:08,661
- Means something.
- Mmm-hmm.

1118
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:24,056
Three times I go around?

1119
01:29:24,397 --> 01:29:26,012
Always coming back.

1120
01:29:26,524 --> 01:29:28,060
I ain't gave to flight.

1121
01:29:34,448 --> 01:29:36,484
Righteousness.

1122
01:29:40,955 --> 01:29:42,570
Loving kindness.

1123
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,375
Justice.

1124
01:30:03,227 --> 01:30:04,683
For all in my ignorance,

1125
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:09,059
I do not hew to the letter
of its practice, that I hope

1126
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:14,270
the brief ceremony
will be respectful to Jewishness!

1127
01:30:14,906 --> 01:30:17,568
Level best, reverend! "A" for effort.

1128
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:20,946
And bless you, my son,
thank you for understanding.

1129
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:25,121
- Sermon's over.
- That's all

1130
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:29,330
I'll now ask the young Ms. Sofia

1131
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,537
to come forward
with the nuptial rings.

1132
01:30:38,638 --> 01:30:41,425
By the powers of each of
their religions and practices,

1133
01:30:41,515 --> 01:30:44,473
I now pronounce Sol and Trixie,
man and wife.

1134
01:30:48,773 --> 01:30:50,604
Should your husband kiss you?

1135
01:30:50,691 --> 01:30:52,932
Lest he be sleeping outdoors.

1136
01:31:17,718 --> 01:31:20,960
Been thinking, Jane.
Maybe I'd like to see the world.

1137
01:31:21,138 --> 01:31:23,800
For instance, what's France like?

1138
01:31:23,891 --> 01:31:25,097
Don't know.

1139
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:27,262
Never wanted to see it
till this minute.

1140
01:32:05,474 --> 01:32:06,554
Happy occasion.

1141
01:32:20,781 --> 01:32:21,816
Papal.

1142
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:54,481
Are you all right?

1143
01:33:05,284 --> 01:33:08,276
Let's figure out what to do
with that land.

1144
01:33:51,789 --> 01:33:54,781
Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
and all risen saints.

1145
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:58,250
For once in your life,
resist the urge for Utterance.

1146
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,755
As witness before my newborn child,
my hope in beginning again,

1147
01:34:06,428 --> 01:34:10,467
I pray we forbear from fucking up
each other's lives further,

1148
01:34:10,558 --> 01:34:12,264
and live in peace and quiet.

1149
01:34:16,438 --> 01:34:19,271
It seems to me, Mrs. Star,

1150
01:34:19,358 --> 01:34:22,100
in coming forward to conciliate me,

1151
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,226
you consign yourself

1152
01:34:24,405 --> 01:34:27,147
to a misery not unlike a sort of

1153
01:34:28,117 --> 01:34:29,117
execution.

1154
01:34:30,953 --> 01:34:35,196
These two gentlemen are sheriff
and deputy from a neighboring town,

1155
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:37,657
brought in to represent my interests.

1156
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:40,709
Sheriff Laraby from lead.

1157
01:34:40,838 --> 01:34:43,124
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Trixie Star

1158
01:34:43,215 --> 01:34:44,901
for the attempted murder
of Mr. George Hearst.

1159
01:34:44,925 --> 01:34:46,210
You get the hell outta here.

1160
01:34:46,468 --> 01:34:48,424
Forbear, son, lest you be undone.

1161
01:34:48,512 --> 01:34:50,048
I'm not your son,

1162
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:52,463
no more than you're the boss
of the fucking future.

1163
01:34:52,725 --> 01:34:55,467
Why, I believe
I am its whole inheritor.

1164
01:34:55,561 --> 01:34:57,643
These men have no jurisdiction here.

1165
01:34:59,231 --> 01:35:01,347
I'm guessing these two you brought

1166
01:35:01,442 --> 01:35:03,524
don't know the extent
of your crimes here.

1167
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:06,603
Prime suspect in the murder
of Charlie Utter.

1168
01:35:07,656 --> 01:35:10,898
Are you going to
incarcerate me again, Marshal Bullock?

1169
01:35:10,993 --> 01:35:12,733
This time, for how many minutes?

1170
01:35:13,245 --> 01:35:14,701
Let's find out together.

1171
01:35:17,499 --> 01:35:19,455
- Little tight on my wrist.
- Shut up.

1172
01:35:19,627 --> 01:35:22,539
Come through my town, you stop
at the Marshal's office first.

1173
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:25,834
Way a fellow lawman would do,
showing any fucking respect.

1174
01:35:25,925 --> 01:35:28,211
Sorry for the interruption.
Carry on with the celebration.

1175
01:35:32,056 --> 01:35:33,341
Smile, Senator Hearst!

1176
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,066
'Fore you lock him up,

1177
01:35:46,195 --> 01:35:49,687
no harm you letting us
have a word with Mr. Hearst.

1178
01:35:49,782 --> 01:35:52,774
Speaking for Charlie Utter,
as is gone from amongst us.

1179
01:35:53,035 --> 01:35:55,071
What's going on here?
What's in train?

1180
01:35:55,162 --> 01:35:59,246
This United States of American Senator

1181
01:36:00,584 --> 01:36:02,620
had Charlie Utter murdered!

1182
01:36:02,753 --> 01:36:05,790
Yeah! He's a murderer!
Without remorse!

1183
01:36:05,923 --> 01:36:07,803
- Nor recourse!
- Can't hide behind that!

1184
01:36:07,883 --> 01:36:09,669
Nor fucking recollection!

1185
01:36:11,762 --> 01:36:14,504
I'll tear your head clean off, boy,
if that'll help recollection.

1186
01:36:14,598 --> 01:36:16,509
Who heaves up the next
gets dealt with.

1187
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,495
- You entitled motherfucker!
- Son of a bitch.

1188
01:36:18,519 --> 01:36:19,634
Steer your people, Marshal.

1189
01:36:19,728 --> 01:36:21,639
- Shut the fuck up!
- Cocksuckers!

1190
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:23,220
Nobody answering no one!

1191
01:36:23,315 --> 01:36:25,727
- Do what all they want!
- You got that right!

1192
01:36:57,641 --> 01:36:59,927
Go on now! Go! Go.

1193
01:37:04,898 --> 01:37:06,809
Easy!
What the hell?

1194
01:37:09,153 --> 01:37:10,643
Come on, let us finish it.

1195
01:37:10,988 --> 01:37:11,988
Leave him be.

1196
01:37:12,948 --> 01:37:14,484
Oh, good God.

1197
01:37:14,616 --> 01:37:16,447
Lest I arrest every one of you.

1198
01:37:19,997 --> 01:37:21,362
I've seen enough.

1199
01:37:31,592 --> 01:37:32,923
Get the fucking Doc.

1200
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:36,844
Oh, yeah, let's do allay
the cocksucker in his misery.

1201
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:38,921
Now, Jane!

1202
01:37:39,016 --> 01:37:40,347
Hope you die in the street.

1203
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:42,387
Like my dad did!

1204
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:46,645
Go on home, now!

1205
01:37:48,692 --> 01:37:49,772
You son of a bitch!

1206
01:37:52,237 --> 01:37:55,149
Have you finished
your impotent display?

1207
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,525
No, I don't believe I have.

1208
01:38:56,009 --> 01:38:58,842
You're my witness, Senator                       .
Marshal's trying to kill you.

1209
01:39:10,524 --> 01:39:12,890
Coward was coming behind you, Bullock.

1210
01:39:13,986 --> 01:39:16,068
About to shoot you back the head.

1211
01:39:16,155 --> 01:39:17,155
Jane.

1212
01:39:27,499 --> 01:39:29,490
You son of a bitch, Harry.

1213
01:39:32,004 --> 01:39:34,871
That was Bill come into me.

1214
01:39:35,007 --> 01:39:36,372
Him come to protect us.

1215
01:39:36,842 --> 01:39:40,084
No, Jane. That was you.

1216
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:02,906
The Good Book, Marshal,

1217
01:40:06,246 --> 01:40:08,202
says,

1218
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:12,704
the Lord chooses
amongst his witnesses

1219
01:40:12,794 --> 01:40:15,035
them'd be thought least likely.

1220
01:40:18,008 --> 01:40:20,090
Is that so?

1221
01:40:24,097 --> 01:40:26,588
You might should oughta know,

1222
01:40:29,811 --> 01:40:31,096
before what happened,

1223
01:40:32,397 --> 01:40:33,477
Mr. Utter

1224
01:40:35,108 --> 01:40:38,942
seemed to me a different man.

1225
01:40:43,784 --> 01:40:46,742
Like a weight
had come off his shoulders.

1226
01:40:50,123 --> 01:40:53,957
What else they say
about the Lord's withesses?

1227
01:40:57,923 --> 01:40:59,413
What else?

1228
01:41:01,134 --> 01:41:04,046
Their defects notwithstanding,

1229
01:41:05,097 --> 01:41:08,260
they testify to us wondrous glory.

1230
01:41:15,607 --> 01:41:18,314
Singing, he was, at the end, Marshal,

1231
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,811
while walking the valley.

1232
01:41:23,824 --> 01:41:26,816
Joyful to hear and behold.

1233
01:41:40,716 --> 01:41:41,796
Singing.

1234
01:42:03,488 --> 01:42:07,276
If you have it in you to abide,
I'd not have you leave me.

1235
01:42:07,367 --> 01:42:09,028
I won't, Al.

1236
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,782
Comes to it,
Jewel and me will see to you.

1237
01:42:12,956 --> 01:42:15,072
I'll have the little one brought in.

1238
01:42:18,295 --> 01:42:22,129
Tôi nghe bạn hát ngày khác.
Tôi nghĩ bạn đã bị đâm một con ếch.

1239
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:29,970
Nếu bạn muốn, Al, tôi có thể chà bàn chân của bạn.

1240
01:42:30,057 --> 01:42:33,549
tay run rẩy, nhưng nó hoạt động tốt.

1241
01:42:33,685 --> 01:42:35,175
Đi trước, sau đó.

1242
01:42:46,114 --> 01:42:47,229
Oh...

1243
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:54,536
Waltzing Matilda
Waltzing Matilda

1244
01:42:54,623 --> 01:42:59,538
bạn sẽ đi một-Waltzing Matilda với tôi

1245
01:42:59,628 --> 01:43:01,835
Xuống đến một Jumbuck

1246
01:43:01,922 --> 01:43:04,163
uống tại các lỗ nước

1247
01:43:04,257 --> 01:43:08,842
lên nhảy Swagman
và túm lấy ông trong glee

1248
01:43:08,929 --> 01:43:11,921
và anh vừa nói vừa đưa anh ta đi

1249
01:43:12,015 --> 01:43:14,176
trong túi Tucker

1250
01:43:14,267 --> 01:43:18,055
bạn sẽ đi một-Waltzing Matilda với tôi

1251
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:23,482
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda

1252
01:43:23,568 --> 01:43:27,857
bạn sẽ đi một-Waltzing Matilda với tôi.

1253
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:45,555
Tôi về nhà.

1254
01:45:29,569 --> 01:45:31,400
Cha của chúng ta,

1255
01:45:32,739 --> 01:45:34,730
mà nghệ thuật ở trên thiên đường ...

1256
01:45:36,034 --> 01:45:40,152
Hãy để anh ta chết tiệt ở lại đó.
