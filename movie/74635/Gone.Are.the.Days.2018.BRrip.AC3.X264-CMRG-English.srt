Why don't you give me a minute?

103
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:30,665
Give me a chance
to get myself cleaned up here.

No.

we're gonna have a big problem,

- What?

I thought you were saving
the last one for yourself.

141
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:39,634
What were you shooting at?

142
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,003
I put a bullet into that tree.

143
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:47,975
Did you hit it?

144
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,578
You're damn straight I did.

145
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:55,948
Well... looks like
you did a hell of a lot

146
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,819
more than just shoot one tree.

147
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,754
Yeah, I burned it down.

148
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:02,523
Oh, good Lord, Taylon.

149
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,929
- [Virgil chuckles]
- I burned it all down.

The whole damn ranch?

151
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,807
- The whole damn thing?
- Well, it got out of hand.

152
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,046
- It what?
- The fire got out of hand.

153
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,251
I mean, I didn't mean to burn
down the ranch, for God's sake.

154
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:31,849
If I need more bullets,
I'll get them from you.

155
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:34,288
Oh, Like hell you will, old man.

156
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:36,992
I feel it's better this way

The whole damn thing?

161
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,069
I tried to chop it down but...

162
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:51,071
I'm getting too old
for that damn nonsense.

163
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,308
I hope you're having fun.

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,750
Go, go. Let's go.

167
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,685
Just follow the light.

168
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,189
Wait, wait, where you going?

169
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,725
- Durango's this way.
- Going to Hesperus first.

170
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:12,193
What? Why?

171
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:15,563
Personal business. You coming?

172
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,565
Come on.

173
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,166
I won't miss it.

174
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:21,836
All right.

175
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:50,998

[moaning]

181
00:26:39,245 --> 00:26:40,214
Hey, Tantrum.

[groaning]

183
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:53,261
Your friend crossed a while ago!

184
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:56,897
[breathes heavily]

185
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,270
- What?
- Your friend...

186
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:03,771
crossed a while ago.

187
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,073
Thought you'd wanna know.

188
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:23,091
How long ago?

189
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:26,427
Can't rightly say.

190
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:28,863
Well.

191
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:47,115
I don't remember crossing
any creek

192
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:49,250
on that trail from Hesperus.

193
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:51,352
Hmm...

194
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,253
Water's changed.

195
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:56,090
- So does the need to cross.
- Huh?

196
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,394
Just saying what I'm saying.

197
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,831
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
[chuckles]

198
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:04,965
- What?
- [chuckles]

199
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,000
- You got to pay me.
- What?

200
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,169
You got to pay me.

201
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:11,506
I ain't paying you
to cross no creek.

202
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:13,274
Aah..

203
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,408
Well...

204
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,377
then you're not crossing
this creek.

205
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:20,848
Maybe we got lost last night.

206
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:23,784
[exhales]

207
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,154
- I guess I'll just go around.
- Now look,

208
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,756
now you wanna get away
from that place...

209
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:34,294
to get to that place,
you got to cross.

210
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:39,501
There's no other way
to get from over there

211
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,369
to that place over there.

212
00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:44,439
You got to pay me.

213
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:46,974
Did Virgil pay you?

214
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:53,180
Everybody pays. Now,
coins will do fine.

215
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:09,930
They're no use to you.

216
00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:12,132
They're only good for crossing.

217
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:20,340
- You hungry?
- No. No. No.

218
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:22,343
Yeah, you are.

219
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:40,861
That's not funny.

220
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:55,443
Oh, Lord.

221
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:58,413
All right.

222
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:05,319
Y'all get along now.

223
00:30:21,658 --> 00:30:22,559
Taylon!

224
00:30:24,818 --> 00:30:26,698
You have a good nap, old man?

225
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,900
Damn, you're slow.
I had to double back for you.

226
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:32,170
Where the hell are we, Virg?

227
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:34,738
On the road to Hesperus.

228
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,444
I don't remember any creek
on the way to Hesperus.

229
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:39,346
Creek?

230
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,846
There ain't no damn creek.

231
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:44,626
- We're in the desert, Taylon.
- Yeah, that old river rat!

232
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:46,283
He just... He sit...

233
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:51,522
I gave him the coins
that you gave me.

234
00:30:51,921 --> 00:30:53,925
So, I could cross the creek.

235
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:59,540
- He take them?
- Yeah, he took them.

236
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:02,176
- Both of them?
- Yeah.

237
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:06,475
- All right then.
- Shit.

238
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,680
Storm's coming,
best get going.

239
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:12,879
See what you're made of, Taylon.

240
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:16,807
Don't tempt me.

241
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:07,341
Heidi, you in here?

242
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,226
[whistles]

243
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,016
Taylon what...
What you doing out in this?

244
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,856
What the hell you doing,
Jaden?

245
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,918
I'm just giving a new pony
a ride.

246
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:29,444
- Where's Sam?
- He died last spring.

247
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:30,953
You can talk to me.

248
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:34,563
I'm the new proprietor
of this establishment.

249
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,023
Where's Heidi?

250
00:32:38,474 --> 00:32:40,644
You... How long
you stabling him for?

251
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:41,848
I asked you a question.

252
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:45,713
Well, she... She's around here,
somewhere.

253
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,142
I'll tell her
you're looking for her.

254
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,410
Can I get you a room?

255
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:56,035
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna need your pistol.

256
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,511
I'm gonna need your rifle.

257
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:00,534
That ain't gonna happen.

258
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,790
No one takes my guns off of me,
nobody.

259
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:09,891
You can't stay in Hesperus
because new sheriff, new rules.

260
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:13,798
I'm gonna need it
before I can give you the key,

261
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,936
and you can't stay in Hesperus

262
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:17,297
if you don't do it.

263
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,513
The only reason
I'm gonna give you my gun,

264
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,583
is I came here to see Heidi.

265
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,372
Make that happen.

266
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:33,746
Well, I'll arrange that.

267
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:48,417
[coughing heavily]

268
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:03,685
You all right?

269
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,547
A bottle of your best.

270
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,512
Wanna dance?

271
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:19,628
No, no, no.

272
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:35,387
Tall glass.

273
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:57,216
Yeah.

274
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:28,067
God damn piano.

275
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:31,850
Piano, it's like tinky-tinky.

276
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:40,887
Have you seen my friend yet?

277
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,464
He's probably upstairs
with a whore.

278
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,890
You know, this is the only place
to stay, so...

279
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,123
You all right, mister?

280
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,582
- Where's Heidi?
- Sam's daughter?

281
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:11,442
She's uh... probably upstairs,
working.

282
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,511
What do you mean working?

283
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:16,720
Jade put her to work here
right after Sam passed.

284
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:22,321
Where?

285
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,153
That son of a bitch.

286
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:39,315
Where's my gun?

287
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:42,628
[thud]

288
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,068
No.

289
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,618
You looking for your guns?

290
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:32,122
Give 'em back, Virgil.
I need' em.

291
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:33,256
Calm down.

292
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:35,593
They took them from you
last night.

293
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:37,694
Who's got them?

294
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:39,430
Don't know.

295
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,201
You have a fun night?

296
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,305
I didn't think you were up
for something like that.

297
00:37:47,537 --> 00:37:51,242
No, I wasn't. Who were you with,
last night?

298
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:53,443
- Some girl.
- A redhead?

299
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,180
Nope. Why?

300
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:00,951
Why are we here?
Let's get going.

301
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,156
- I gotta give her something.
- Give who what?

302
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:07,258
Heidi.

303
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,127
[exhales]

304
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:13,698
Why don't you just tell her
she's your daughter?

305
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,502
I've been trying for 20 years.

306
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:21,571
Can't find the words.

307
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:27,510
Look...

308
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:30,647
I find out she's whoring.

309
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:34,417
And...

310
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,689
I need some time
to figure it out.

311
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:47,330
Well... I can't stay.

312
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:50,634
They don't like me much
in this town and...

313
00:38:53,437 --> 00:38:54,739
I've already had my dance.

314
00:38:57,374 --> 00:38:58,274
Tell you what.

315
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:02,146
How about I go on ahead,

316
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,482
- scout out the bank?
- Do that.

317
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:09,587
Good. Glad you agree.

318
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,624
Don't you go dying
before we get to Durango.

319
00:39:15,258 --> 00:39:17,328
Go on, get.
I got... I gotta get some sleep.

320
00:39:36,646 --> 00:39:37,781
Eat your peas, son.

321
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:53,727
Hurry up, hurry up!
We gotta get laid

322
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:55,165
before we get outta them whores.

323
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:56,499
Damn right.

324
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,665
I haven't had a poke
in damn near a week.

325
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,171
- Let's go.
- Hey, fellas!

326
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,809
We got youngins
and a lady here with us.

327
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:11,414
You boys look new to Durango.

328
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:14,385
Hell, we are, we just come down
from the mine.

329
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:18,520
Who's the old man,
trying to hush us?

00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:19,557
That, there's our sheriff.

331
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:21,759
Will McMullen's his name.

332
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:25,696
Used to be a Texas Ranger.

333
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,834
You don't say.
A real-life Texas Ranger?

334
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:33,838
Well, hell. I gotta meet him.

335
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:35,937
- Take it easy, now.

Hey. Hey.

338
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:43,180
What part of Texas you used
to ranger?

339
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:47,417
The whole state.

340
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:50,854
Lived in San Antonio,
if that's what you mean.

341
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:55,191
Hey, Tommy. You from them parts.

342
00:40:55,825 --> 00:40:57,895
You ever hear of a Ranger
named Will McMullen?

343
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:00,396
Nope.

344
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:03,166
Just wanted you to watch
your language, that's all.

345
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:08,870
I think the old Ranger
is threatening you.

346
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:09,772
Woo...

347
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:14,611
Watch yourself now.

348
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:17,814
- That right, old man?
- Yeah.

349
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:19,716
- You threatening me?
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:41:21,383 --> 00:41:24,155
Ma'am, I will cover your dinner,

351
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:27,290
while you get your children
out of here now.

352
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,327
Let's go. Thank you, Sheriff.

353
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:32,530
Go on, get...

354
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,769
All right, you take it easy,
partner. I got a drink here.

355
00:41:42,504 --> 00:41:45,175
- Damn, that steak looks good.
- Uh-huh.

356
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:52,515
Welcome to town, fellas.

357
00:41:53,515 --> 00:41:54,918
It's a peaceful little town.

358
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:59,254
Sure, we got gentlemen that like
to kick the stink around

359
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:00,257
from time to time.

360

But not while the sun's up.

361
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,895
Not around youngins.
Not around women.

362
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:09,296
So, if you abide by the rules,

363
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:11,868
I'll be willing to forget
about all this.

364
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:14,537
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

365
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:17,740
- What about you?
- Okay, sure.

366
00:42:24,046 --> 00:42:24,948
Enjoy.

367
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:32,689
Now, you boys have fun tonight.

368
00:42:38,928 --> 00:42:39,897
Giovanni.

369
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:46,636
You make sure that they're fed
and watered.

370
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:48,906
- There you go.
- Much obliged, sheriff.

371
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:58,314
Y'all ever talk
about my past life again...

372
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:00,784
I'll kill you both.

373
00:43:02,885 --> 00:43:04,554
- Understood?
- Yeah.

374
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:06,689
- Hmm?
- Yes.

375
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:13,664
Good day, gentlemen.

376
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:28,545
- You have my back, huh?
- You screwed it up.

377
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:54,037
Will.

378
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:58,772
- What now?
- That feller out on the ranch,

379
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:00,943
you told me to let you know
if anything changed and...

380
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:04,048
He's taken a turn
these past few weeks.

381
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:06,783
Thought he'd pass
when I saw him the other day.

382
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,551
- How long?
- It's hard to say, really.

383
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,955
I told him I'd bring the priest
out in few days.

384
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:15,658
All right, then.

385
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:17,627
All right.

386
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:20,464
And he was mumbling something
about a...

387
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:22,666
it was a fella named Virgil.

388
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:28,638
Uh-huh.

389
00:44:30,073 --> 00:44:32,542
Just... rambling, I guess.

390
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:35,778
Well, I'm sorry, Will.

391
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,949
Sorry? He ain't
no friend of mine.

392
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:42,553
All right then, Doc,
let me know when he's passed.

393
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:45,588
Will do. You have a good day.

00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:11,615
<i>Hope that the sun shines
tomorrow</i>

397

398
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:24,895
Finally amongst the living.

399
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:34,538
Heard you were asking for me
last night.

400
00:45:36,673 --> 00:45:37,707
Sorry, I didn't show.

401
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:45,415
Well...

402
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:51,588
Were you with my friend Virgil
last night?

403
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:53,857
You weren't with him,
were you?

404
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:56,026
No.

405
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,195
Honestly...

406
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,064
I was surprised
when Jaden told me

407
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,033
you wanted me.

408
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:06,502
Wanted you?

409
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:09,106
What the hell are you doing?

410
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:11,908
Nothing, I just...

411
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:15,109
thought I should clean up
for you

412
00:46:15,111 --> 00:46:16,146
before we get to it.

413
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:20,484
Isn't that why you're here?

414
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:27,156
Yeah, well...

415
00:46:29,158 --> 00:46:31,795
I just wanted to come see you.

416
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:33,964
Hey, well, you're seeing me.

417
00:46:34,564 --> 00:46:36,133
Yeah, and you're all grown up.

418
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,203
You're a woman now...

419
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:43,640
and I missed it all.

420
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:51,248
I didn't come to see you
as a whore.

421
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,252
What right have you to say that?

422
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:06,530
Look, if...

423
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,234
if you're not here for a poke,
then you need to go.

424
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:19,243
I'm sorry, look, I just...
My head's not... working right.

425
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,880
Will you put some clothes on?
Hmm?

426

Put some clothes, please?

427
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,055
Jaden hates it
when I ain't making money. So...

428
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:36,158
if you aren't here for me.

429
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:40,030
What are you here for?

430
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:44,734
Look...

431
00:47:53,676 --> 00:47:56,280
Is this enough to get me through
to tomorrow morning?

432
00:47:57,146 --> 00:47:59,015
- Right there.
- Yeah, yeah, sure is.

433
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:00,716
Good.

434
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,154
I need you to tell me
where my gun is.

435
00:48:04,386 --> 00:48:06,756
Jaden locks up everybody's guns
until they leave.

436
00:48:09,758 --> 00:48:12,660
And where is he hiding under,
that son of a bitch,

437

under some kind of rock?

I don't know. But he ain't here.

Yeah, right, well,
I am gonna kill him.

Well, what rock is that son
of a bitch under?

- Hey.
- I am gonna kill him.

in the morning.

You okay?

444
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:10,653
You don't look so good.

that Will wasn't no Ranger.

- He'll still come after me.

818
01:17:55,575 --> 01:17:58,413
No, he won't. I'll see to it.

819
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:01,415
Just give it back.
Take it to the bank.

820
01:18:02,717 --> 01:18:04,586
- How?
- We gotta go. Come on, come on.

821
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,502
Sheriff!

822
01:18:24,105 --> 01:18:26,540
- Sheriff.
- What do you want, Jaden?

823
01:18:34,147 --> 01:18:35,784
One of my whores tried
to kill me.

824
01:18:36,117 --> 01:18:38,119
Burnt down the stable
and stole all my money.

825
01:18:38,586 --> 01:18:39,988
I think she's hiding
in your town.

826
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,457
And she did all that
for no reason?

827
01:18:43,925 --> 01:18:45,961
- Give me that!
- I need my rifle.

828
01:18:46,793 --> 01:18:49,830
- I won't have this in my county.
- Have what?

829
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:52,798
Well, let's just say
shooting people

830
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,834
in the back doesn't go
over so well

831
01:18:54,836 --> 01:18:56,070
around these parts.

832
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:59,071
I don't want her to get away.

833
01:18:59,073 --> 01:19:01,776
Well, I don't want anyone
to get hurt, you understand?

834
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:05,613
- She will go before the judge.
- She tried to kill me, Will.

835
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:09,517
- And she may be with Taylon.
- She did? Really?

836
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,485
Well, I'd be real careful.

837
01:19:12,787 --> 01:19:14,152
Yeah,
you might have a bigger fight

838
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:15,122
than you even know.

839
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:17,092
How's that?

840
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:22,431
Well, that fella she's with,
he is one mean sumbitch.

841
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:38,779
[door closes]

842
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,021
I'll be with you in a moment,
ma'am.

843
01:19:51,758 --> 01:19:52,660
How may I help you?

844
01:19:53,762 --> 01:19:55,864
- I'd like to make a deposit.
- Okay, and your name?

845
01:19:56,196 --> 01:19:58,199
I would like to put it
under the name of Jaden Pens...

846
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:03,672
Open that safe.

847
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:06,538
Really?

848
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,208
Taylon...

849
01:20:08,109 --> 01:20:11,480
is Wesley Flynn,
from Texas.

850
01:20:12,178 --> 01:20:16,217
The same guy who tried to rob
our bank twenty years ago.

851
01:20:16,617 --> 01:20:18,653
- Mm-hmm.
- Whose wife got hung.

852
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:20,221
How long you known that?

853
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:22,656
Far too long.

854
01:20:24,257 --> 01:20:25,961
What the hell are you doing?

855
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:27,529
[Heidi screaming]

856
01:20:32,098 --> 01:20:35,102
Shut up! Shut up, whore!

857
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:39,975
You stay put or I'll f...
I'll finish you.

858
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:45,113
I'm only saying things once.
Open this up.

859
01:20:56,356 --> 01:21:01,061
Come on out. Yeah.
Get the hell out. Go on, get.

860
01:21:06,266 --> 01:21:08,135
Now, we know what happened
to Virgil.

861
01:21:09,102 --> 01:21:11,002
But what happened
to the other guy?

862
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:12,871
What other guy?
There were only two of them.

863
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:15,544
No, there was another guy
that rode with him in Texas.

864
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:19,314
If memory serves,
his name was Jake O'Malley.

865
01:21:20,013 --> 01:21:21,216
Well, I wouldn't know.

866
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:23,118
You wouldn't know?

867
01:21:24,185 --> 01:21:26,922
I thought you're a Texas Ranger.
They're from Texas.

868
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,822
It's a big state, Texas.
There're a lot of outlaws

869
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:31,760
in Texas.

870
01:21:31,926 --> 01:21:33,895
So I'm beginning
to understand now.

871
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:36,664
Sheriff, you gotta hurry.

872
01:21:37,931 --> 01:21:41,265
Roy, what... what is the matter?
You'll give yourself agita.

873
01:21:41,267 --> 01:21:42,867
What are you...
what is the matter?

874
01:21:42,869 --> 01:21:45,039
The bank is being robbed,
right now!

875
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:47,038
- Damn!
- And at gunpoint!

876
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,077
- I think he's gonna kill her!
- What woman?

877
01:21:49,709 --> 01:21:52,844
- Tall, pretty one. Fancy dress.
- What color is her hair?

878
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:53,647
Red!

879
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,149
That's the whore, sheriff!

880
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:58,117
You stay... no, you stay
outta this, Jaden.

881
01:21:58,119 --> 01:21:59,718
I need the rifle,
I can help you.

882
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,321
No, no.

883
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:01,656
I don't need you in this.

884
01:22:02,757 --> 01:22:03,892
- I want to help you!
- Shut up and get out of here!

885
01:22:05,059 --> 01:22:07,896
- God!
- Go on! Get out, go on!

886
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,274
[mumbling]

887
01:22:19,673 --> 01:22:23,611
Come on. Come on, get up.
Get up.

888
01:22:25,178 --> 01:22:27,015
[breathing heavily]

889
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,117
[birds chirping]

890
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:30,217
Here.

891
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:33,087
Find a hiding place and wait.

892
01:22:33,788 --> 01:22:35,790
Till you hear the gunshots
from them coming for me,

893
01:22:35,955 --> 01:22:38,090
but be quick 'cause
that train's gonna want

894
01:22:38,092 --> 01:22:39,661
to get the hell out.

895
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,228
- I don't understand...
- You've always deserved,

896
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,865
- a better life, Heidi.
- Why are you doing this for me?

897
01:22:46,867 --> 01:22:47,968
Well, that's why.

898
01:22:49,837 --> 01:22:50,405
Taylon.

899
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,413
We're running out of time.
You gotta go, now. Get, go.

900
01:23:02,415 --> 01:23:04,319
- Go on. Go.
- I won't forget you.

901
01:23:05,252 --> 01:23:08,123
My county, I'll handle it.
Go on.

902
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:11,159
Go.

903
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:23,270
Hey! You kids! Get outta there!
Go inside now!

904
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:26,071
All of you, get off the street!

905
01:23:26,073 --> 01:23:27,008
[horses neigh]

906
01:23:34,013 --> 01:23:35,417
Get that thing out of here!

907
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,156
- Where's your partner?
- You told me

908
01:23:42,323 --> 01:23:43,758
to tell him to wait
at the train station.

909
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,293
Give me your pistol.
Give it to me.

910
01:23:47,293 --> 01:23:47,994
Go get him.

911
01:23:48,428 --> 01:23:49,897
The whore's down here
in the bank.

912
01:24:06,312 --> 01:24:09,217
[coughing]

913
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,854
[breathing heavily]

914
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:24,798
[dramatic music playing]

915
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:46,488
Is that Jake out there
with them?

916
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:47,955
What?

917
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:53,325
How would that be Jake?
What the hell would he be doing

918
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:54,229
up here?

919
01:25:01,534 --> 01:25:04,502
I'm telling you it is, he's got
that damn Winchester

920
01:25:04,504 --> 01:25:06,106
pointed straight at us.

921
01:25:07,007 --> 01:25:10,178
Yeah. Does he know it's us?

922
01:25:12,046 --> 01:25:14,112
He will when he sees
that damn crooked smile

923
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,350
- of yours.
- There you go.

924
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:22,389
You know, Virgil?

925
01:25:25,092 --> 01:25:26,261
He's gonna kill you.

926
01:25:28,863 --> 01:25:30,198
[gun fires in slow motion]

927
01:25:35,535 --> 01:25:36,436
Yeah.

928
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,140
I know.

929
01:25:41,175 --> 01:25:45,379
Virg... I'm sorry I didn't go
out front with you.

930
01:25:47,413 --> 01:25:49,149
I'm sorry I didn't die with you.

931
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,019
I really am.

932
01:25:56,155 --> 01:25:57,191
[sigh]

933
01:25:59,025 --> 01:25:59,894
I know.

934
01:26:02,029 --> 01:26:03,464
But that's why we're here now.

935
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,968
So, let's get to business.

936
01:26:10,037 --> 01:26:12,207
I think we could probably
take them all down this time,

937
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:15,109
even Jake
and his damn Winchester.

938
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:17,244
We go on three.

939
01:26:18,177 --> 01:26:19,046
One...

940
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:23,383
- You wait, wait, Virg.
- ...Two! You ready?

941
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,253
Let's give them hell.

942
01:26:25,619 --> 01:26:26,320
[gun clicks]

943
01:26:27,053 --> 01:26:28,455
You don't need to do this,
Taylon.

944
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:32,559
Is that you, Jake?

945
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:36,931
Of course, it's me.
Stop this now!

946
01:26:39,065 --> 01:26:40,934
You wanna see
if he'll surrender to you?

947
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:43,071
Do what?

948
01:26:44,004 --> 01:26:45,073
You wanna see
if he'll surrender to you?

949
01:26:45,638 --> 01:26:46,638
That's a good idea. [chuckles]

950
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,976
[both laughing]

951
01:26:51,011 --> 01:26:52,080
[birds chirping]

952
01:26:57,117 --> 01:26:58,986
We both know,
you're not gonna harm the girl.

953
01:27:00,354 --> 01:27:01,321
So, come on out.

954
01:27:02,323 --> 01:27:04,225
She'll be fine unless you try
to break in here.

955
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:08,962
- You don't need her. Let her go.
- Not until you hear me out!

956
01:27:10,096 --> 01:27:12,132
Jaden is trying
to kill the whore.

957
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,334
And all she did

958
01:27:14,668 --> 01:27:17,105
was give me back my horse
and my money.

959
01:27:17,671 --> 01:27:19,106
She tried to kill me!

960
01:27:20,207 --> 01:27:21,206
[glass smashes]

961
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,243
[gunshots firing]

962
01:27:29,516 --> 01:27:33,922
Stop firing! Stop firing!
You too, Taylon!

963
01:27:39,258 --> 01:27:41,128
He needs killing, Jake!

964
01:27:41,695 --> 01:27:43,564
He shot Sam in the back!

965
01:27:44,464 --> 01:27:45,533
Did you hear what I said?

966
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:47,635
Take it to the judge!

967
01:27:48,267 --> 01:27:50,137
I promise,
you'll get a fair hearing.

968
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:52,539
Well, that's not gonna happen.

969
01:27:53,673 --> 01:27:55,310
Jaden will never stop
hunting her.

970
01:27:58,678 --> 01:28:02,316
- She's not an outlaw.
- Nope. She ain't.

971
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,485
[train blows whistle]

972
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:09,023
Ain't a whore no more either,
and that's because of you.

973
01:28:11,557 --> 01:28:12,526
But you...

974
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:16,094
you are an outlaw.

975
01:28:16,096 --> 01:28:17,464
[loads gun and rolls round]
