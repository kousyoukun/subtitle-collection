1
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:14,856
Half-hour dinner break.

2
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,556
70 wounded and 34 were missing.

3
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,858
I'm sorry. We're out of chicken salad.

4
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,900
Half mile south of the southern boundary
that separates North and South Vietnam.

5
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,703
In this last week in Vietnam...

6
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:10,439
...there are a reported 141 American dead...

7
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,547
...391 wounded, and 47 listed as missing.

8
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,913
Other news. In Washington
this afternoon, the Congressional...

9
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:28,825
Hey, Birdlace!
I want a girl just like this, man.

10
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,190
Babe!

11
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,005
Back here!

12
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,877
Bring it back here now!

13
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,649
Damn you, Birdlace.

14
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,049
No, you don't. Back here to me.

15
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,719
It looks like a cartoon.

16
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,726
Stand by, men.
Asshole approaching, 11 o'clock.

17
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,265
Berzin, ladies...

18
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,365
This here is Fector.
He wanted to meet you.

19
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,425
Yeah.

20
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,669
How you guys hanging?

21
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,602
So, what can we do for you, Fector?

22
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,976
Donavin says you guys are sponsoring
a little get-together.

23
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,973
I want in, if it's okay.

24
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,316
I don't know, Fector.
We're a pretty elite group.

25
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,643
- What do you think, Birdlace?
- You know the rules?

26
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:30,488
You break the rules, you don't get your jing
back, not a fucking dime. You got that?

27
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,692
Do you have anyone to bring
to this event, Fec-dork?

28
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,761
Fucking A, I got someone to bring.

29
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:42,802
Sounds pretty elite to me, guys.
What do you think, Benjamin?

30
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,840
Fector, you got the $50?

31
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,700
Shit. Looks like
an outstanding candidate to me.

32
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,575
Out-fucking-standing.

33
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:53,448
How about that, Fector? Okie likes you.

34
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,078
In fact, we all like you.
That means you're in.

35
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,081
Festivities begin precisely at 1900.

36
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,282
You'll be there.

37
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll be there in dress blues, tennis shoes,
and a fur-lined fucking jockstrap.

38
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,461
Count on it.

39
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,603
Fector? Sounds more like '"fective'" to me.

40
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:18,165
Defective.

41
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,573
Dumb motherfucker
still shitting boot camp chow.

42
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:22,133
Definitely. Roger that.

43
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,145
Twenty-two. That's the biggest ever.

44
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,874
We going to have us a time.

45
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,251
Yes, sir, we going to have
some kind of time.

46
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,888
Attention, passengers.

47
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,158
The bus to Santa Cruz has been canceled.

48
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,965
The bus from Los Angeles
will be 20 minutes late.

49
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,731
All right, men. Fall in.

50
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,064
Attention!

51
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,069
One question, men.

52
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:01,014
- Are we assholes or Marines?
- Sir, assholes, sir!

53
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:05,609
- Wrong! We're Marines! What are we?
- Sir, Marines, sir!

54
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,212
And we are not just Marines.

55
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,885
We are the Four Bees. What are we?

56
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,951
Sir, the Four fucking Bees. Aye, aye, sir!

57
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:17,655
The Four Bees have a special mission.
What's that mission?

58
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,430
To take no prisoners and not become one!

59
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,301
Out-fucking-standing, men.

60
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,932
Muster at 1900.

61
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:29,844
Good hunting, gentlemen.

62
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,174
Fall out.

63
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,126
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,145
An older sister maybe?

65
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:10,515
Maggie. Debbie's really mad at you.
You're in big trouble this time. Excuse me.

66
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,663
Excuse me. I'm new in town.

67
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,969
I thought maybe we could see some sights.

68
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,531
The Golden Gate...

69
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:34,906
You slut.

70
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,679
Excuse me. I overheard you.

71
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,874
I'm new here, too. I've got a map.

72
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,348
Where do you want to go?

73
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,417
Gee, thanks, but...

74
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,482
I'm not interested.
I mean, no, I don't need your help.

75
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,590
I got to go.

76
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,222
- Where is he?
- You talking to me?

77
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,596
Yes, ma'am, now, where is he?

78
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,430
- Who?
- Your husband.

79
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,962
I don't have a husband.

80
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,764
- You don't have a husband?
- No.

81
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,870
Where's your boyfriend?

82
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,378
No boyfriend. What is it you want?

83
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,980
Are you a lesbian?

84
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,010
No, I'm not.

85
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,610
A pretty little thing like yourself
with no husband, no boyfriend...

86
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,449
You got to be a lesbian.

87
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,821
No, I'm just here by myself, that's all.

88
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,122
Not anymore. My name's Buell.

89
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,656
A lot of people call me Okie.

90
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,894
You can call me Okie.

91
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,366
Only if you wanted to.

92
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,500
Betty, hi!

93
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:48,382
Hey, I don't know you.

94
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,652
What do you mean you don't know me?

95
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,451
We've been writing to each other
for seven months.

96
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,682
I said I'd meet you here?

97
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,228
Betty, it's me Sam, Sam Benjamin.

98
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,521
I'm not Betty. I'm Ruth Two Bears.

99
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,927
What do you mean?

100
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,196
You look just like Betty... Betty Lynx Leg.

101
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,067
Jesus, this...

102
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,443
Jesus, this is really very embarrassing.

103
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,043
I'm sorry, Ruth.

104
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,048
I need a drink.

105
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,018
Let me buy you a drink.

106
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,747
Make it up to you.

107
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,753
I swear, I thought you were Betty.

108
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,084
When I say '"spitting image'"...
You have no Lynx Leg blood in you?

109
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,631
Hello.

110
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,198
The Marines have landed.

111
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,934
- Oh, great.
- I'll be there in an hour.

112
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:53,073
- What I was saying, Gladys...
- Alice.

113
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,879
Sorry, Alice. I was saying you're nice.

114
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,817
I'm being sincere.

115
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,714
Listen, I'm a United States Marine.

116
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,554
I'm leaving tomorrow morning to Okinawa.

117
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,787
I wanted to have a nice time, that's all.

118
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:07,453
- You want a nice time?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,498
Get yourself a streetwalker.

120
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,294
Fucking shit!

121
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,972
Excuse me.

122
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:26,511
Oh, it's pouring out.
We're going to get soaked.

123
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,690
What will you have?

124
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,789
A cup of coffee's fine...

125
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,995
And I'll take one of those delicious-looking
doughnuts, too, please.

126
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,436
- What kind you want?
- Chocolate, please.

127
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,906
Say, are these things homemade?

128
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,002
No.

129
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:59,576
Well, they smell it.

130
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,980
We're going to be closing soon.

131
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,848
Wow.

132
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:44,186
Please. Don't stop. You sound real good.

133
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,355
It's great. It's one of my favorite songs.

134
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,092
Actually, it reminds me a lot of...

135
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,068
Of Jim Swaine's music.

136
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,659
Don't you think so?

137
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,295
I don't know him.

138
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,430
Wow. Jim Swaine?

139
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,704
Well, he's just...

140
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,408
Well, you've heard of Dylan, right?
Bob Dylan?

141
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,676
Yeah.

142
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,310
Jim Swaine is a major influence
on Dylan's music.

143
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,587
I thought...

144
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,988
...Woody Guthrie was Dylan's influence.

145
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:17,025
Well, yeah.

146
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,926
There's Woody,
and then there's Jim Swaine.

147
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,259
In fact, I think that Jim Swaine and Woody
cowrote some songs together.

148
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,527
If I'm not mistaken.

149
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,171
I thought Woody wrote pretty much
on his own.

150
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,404
Sometimes he did. He did, most definitely.

151
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,805
But sometimes, he would, you know,
collaborate with Swaine.

152
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:40,640
In other words, Woody wrote the words,
and Swaine wrote the music.

153
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:43,844
Other times, they'd switch.
See what I'm saying?

154
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,112
Like that famous song of his.

155
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,156
You know the one I mean?

156
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,859
- This Land Is Your Land?
- This Land Is Your Land. Exactly.

157
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,121
Yeah, that was...

158
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,632
That was an original
by Swaine and Guthrie.

159
00:11:58,701 --> 00:11:59,895
That's strange.

160
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:04,464
I've got the sheet music upstairs.
I don't remember seeing his name.

161
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,108
He was a ghostwriter. Sometimes.

162
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,502
In fact, most of the time.

163
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,944
Rose, your break's over.
Let's get those tables set up for tomorrow.

164
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,044
Your coffee's getting cold.

165
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,451
Thank you.

166
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,650
Do you write your own stuff?

167
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,127
Jeez, no.

168
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,630
You should. You've got the voice for it.

169
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,791
- Really?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

170
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,904
Hey. My apologies.

171
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,108
I'm not used to being around ladies.

172
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,904
It's okay. I should get back to work.

173
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:43,670
Sure.

174
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,708
Listen, I'm just a dumb jarhead.

175
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,013
I am sorry.

176
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:52,348
It's okay.

177
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:57,091
So what time do you close up here?

178
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,054
In a little while.

179
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,128
What's a jarhead?

180
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:08,759
That's just what we call ourselves.
I'm a United States Marine.

181
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,966
It's okay if we say it,
but if a squid says it, a sailor...

182
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,508
...then it's fist city.

183
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:17,672
It's all right if a woman says it,
especially if she sings like you.

184
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,178
Thanks.

185
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,010
Thanks very much...

186
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,874
...jarhead.

187
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:31,850
- So, what's your name?
- Rose, Rose Fenny.

188
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,527
Rose's cafe. You own this place.

189
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,024
No. My mother does. Her name's Rose.

190
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,533
Same as me, same as my grandmother.

191
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,201
That's nice.

192
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,940
- You're a Marine?
- Yes, ma'am.

193
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,347
Edward Baines Birdlace?

194
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,979
Okay. It's not that funny.

195
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,848
Sorry. It's a nice name.

196
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,114
Thanks.

197
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,423
Gosh, you look so angry.

198
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,618
I'm not angry. I'm just ready.

199
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:06,985
Ready for what?

200
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,487
Ready for anything.

201
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,427
Date of birth: November 26, 1944.

202
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:16,471
That's soon. Today's the 21st.

203
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,564
This Monday. 19 big ones.

204
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:21,609
Well, happy birthday, Corporal Birdlace.

205
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:23,743
Gee, thanks.

206
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,877
I better shove off soon. Going to a party.

207
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,319
Birthday party?

208
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,017
No, just... Sort of a regular party.

209
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,717
Say, maybe you'd like to go with me.

210
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,064
Actually, I'm still working.

211
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,033
Sure. Right. I understand.

212
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,633
No. I've got to be here till closing tonight.

213
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:51,297
Rose, listen.

214
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,501
I'm a Marine and Marines are jerks.
Everybody knows that.

215
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:57,546
If you don't want to go with me, just say so.

216
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:01,781
It's just... My mom would be alone.

217
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,019
Well, I don't want to get anyone in trouble
with their old lady, so...

218
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,729
It was nice to have met you, Rose.
Nice to have met you.

219
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:16,856
'Bye.

220
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:23,897
Rose?

221
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,603
You sing real good.

222
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,207
Real good.

223
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,843
Shit.

224
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,789
You almost done, honey?

225
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,758
What is this, Wednesday?
I wonder what's on TV tonight.

226
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,921
We'll go upstairs
and watch something nice.

227
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,863
- I got some new green stamps...
- Excuse me.

228
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,700
I love women that take pride in...

229
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,832
- Go away.
- Eddie!

230
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,133
I'm going with you, okay?

231
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,069
This is great.

232
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,014
It's great.

233
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,381
- What about your mother?
- What about her?

234
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,186
This is great.

235
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,415
I'm going to go get changed now.

236
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,022
- What kind of party is this?
- A party party.

237
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,890
- A dress-up party?
- Yes, a dress-up party.

238
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:21,521
Okay.

239
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,996
Listen, Rose, why don't you bring
your guitar along?

240
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,192
I'm not ready to sing in front
of an audience.

241
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:31,404
That's fine, too.
It'll be great just to have you along.

242
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,869
- Rosie?
- I'm going to a party, okay?

243
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,944
- There's still all this work.
- I'll do it before we open.

244
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,916
Rose...

245
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,917
I promise.

246
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,426
Jesus God.

247
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,160
You look great.

248
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,460
Yeah?

249
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,104
Outstanding.

250
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,434
Thanks.

251
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,049
I'm really glad I decided to come.

252
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,808
Oh, great. Me, too.

253
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,116
It's nice to get away from the restaurant...

254
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,417
...from my mom.

255
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,153
I don't hate her or anything.
It's just, her whole life's the restaurant.

256
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,990
I don't want it to be like that.

257
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,394
I don't blame you a bit.

258
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,226
The Trouble with Mimi.

259
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:14,864
- Did you see this?
- I don't go to flicks much.

260
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:17,167
This kind of thing drives me crazy.

261
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:22,006
There are people right now, fighting
for their lives and for their freedom...

262
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:26,138
...while here we are watching this trash
which doesn't mean anything.

263
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:29,545
- Then why did you see it?
- My mom.

264
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:31,245
She loved it.

265
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,450
We don't agree on anything lately.
She's content, you know, living her life.

266
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,118
I don't want to...

267
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,118
I want to have an effect on the world.

268
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:43,824
I want to get out there and get involved.

269
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:46,993
You know, I'd like to join the Peace Corps...

270
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,970
...or maybe go down south
and help out there...

271
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,204
I don't know.

272
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,469
It's just so frustrating.

273
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,970
Yeah, I know what you mean.

274
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,739
- I'm really glad I decided to come.
- Me, too.

275
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:04,377
It's really nice to talk to someone.
It's really nice.

276
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,613
It is.

277
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,013
Big party!

278
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,888
Rose, you got really nice lips.

279
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,983
What?

280
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,961
You got nice lips. Are you wearing lipstick?

281
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,724
- Yes.
- Yeah?

282
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,732
It's kind of wearing down, I see.

283
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:20,629
- It is?
- A little bit. Got more?

284
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,693
- Should I put some more on?
- Sure.

285
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,863
Okay.

286
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,843
Let me try.

287
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,412
- Can I, please?
- Okay.

288
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:40,355
Eddie...

289
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:41,650
Hold still.

290
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,054
Eddie...

291
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,793
You put on lipstick about as good as I do.

292
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:50,764
You're supposed to put lipstick on the lips.

293
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,493
It's all over my...

294
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,793
It's all over my mouth now.

295
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,998
Wait. Maybe I can fix this.

296
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,276
It's all over the place.

297
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,871
There. That's fine, right?

298
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,814
Never mind. Forget about it.

299
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,316
You look fine.

300
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,908
You think I look okay?

301
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,476
It's all right.

302
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,990
'"The Nitelite.'"

303
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,590
Wow. Looks like a pretty fancy place, huh?

304
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,824
Rose, this party's no big deal.
We don't have to go in...

305
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,092
I'd like to. Yeah.

306
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,101
We can go somewhere else
if you just want to dance.

307
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:28,901
That's okay.

308
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,634
All right, come on.

309
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,841
- There you go, buddy.
- Thanks.

310
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:37,812
Friend of yours?

311
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,141
Come on.

312
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,786
Good evening, Corporal Birdlace.
Good evening, ma'am.

313
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:49,346
Fine woman you got there, Corporal.

314
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,621
I'll be sure to include this in my report
to the inspector general.

315
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,288
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck, Corporal.

316
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,922
Wait a second.

317
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,096
- I just want to...
- You look great.

318
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:02,835
- Really?
- Really. You do.

319
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,139
- Okay.
- Let's hit it.

320
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,108
You want a party? You got yourself a party.

321
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:21,887
- Hey, Birdlace!
- Hey, Zaworsky!

322
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:28,393
This is Rose.

323
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:29,896
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Rose.

324
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,933
Welcome to paradise, Corporal.

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,763
Thank you, Corporal.

326
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,023
- To the Four Bees!
- And their ladies.

327
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,323
And their girls.

328
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,330
- Semper fi.
- Semper fi!

329
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:07,801
That's only three B's.
Berzin, Benjamin, and Birdlace.

330
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,934
My name's Buell. They just call me Okie.

331
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,940
You've all been friends since boot camp?

332
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:16,637
No. In boot camp, you line up by height.

333
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:21,649
In ITR, infantry training after boot camp,
it's alphabetical order.

334
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,843
So we always lined up together.

335
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,352
Got to be pretty tight.

336
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,085
Everyone started calling us the Four Bees.

337
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,057
And we've stuck together since then.

338
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,854
So, you got to be friends
from standing in line?

339
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:44,428
Well, I'm happy to meet you all. I really am.

340
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,440
Where's our fucking drinks?

341
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,602
- You guys like to swear.
- No. We like to drink.

342
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:54,210
No big thing, Rose. It's just words.
After a while, you don't even hear it.

343
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,647
Don't mean shit.

344
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:59,050
- Make room for another round.
- I've already had two.

345
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,850
Honey, don't worry about it.

346
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:03,618
It's just a mai tai. Very weak drink.

347
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,191
Trust me. You won't get drunk.

348
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,195
Right. Drink up. I'll take another double.

349
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:09,787
Everyone on the dance floor!

350
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,957
Thanks.

351
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,431
Gentlemen, I say we dance.

352
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:14,730
Right.

353
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,730
Care to dance, Miss Two Bears?

354
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,103
Come on, darling. Let's hit it.

355
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:21,472
Let's see if we can make a rainstorm.

356
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,807
Let's show them what we got.

357
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,945
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

358
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,581
- Well, you sure seem mad.
- I'm happier than a two-peckered owl.

359
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,178
It's the fucking waitress.

360
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:36,381
Come on, Eddie. Let's dance.

361
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,950
We'll be there in a minute.
She has to finish her drink still.

362
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,696
Come on, honey.
Get off your ass and dance.

363
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,163
Got some tough competition out there.

364
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:10,522
- Having a good time, Corporal Birdlegs?
- Yeah, yeah. Carry on, asshole.

365
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,420
- Birdlegs?
- It's just a nickname.

366
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:16,922
- Waitress!
- Don't drink any more.

367
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,224
Talk to me.

368
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,928
What kind of a bird is that?

369
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:24,935
A bluebird, the bluebird of happiness.

370
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,975
See? It flies.
It carries me from all the troubles...

371
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,068
...and takes me to where it's all happy.

372
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,669
Crock of shit.

373
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,443
Does it ever work?

374
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,347
Let's get out of here.

375
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,286
I thought we were supposed to dance.

376
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:44,291
You're a nice girl. This is a fucked-up place.

377
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,691
I'd like to dance. Come on.

378
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:48,661
Let's hit it, Birdlegs.

379
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,857
Yeah. Semper fi, do or die.

380
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:39,944
What do you give her?

381
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:43,513
- Four.
- Four?

382
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,177
She's not even a woman, for Christ's sake.

383
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:48,517
Bullshit.

384
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,322
She's a fucking guy in drag.

385
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,191
How can you give her a four?

386
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,060
Son of a bitch, that is a guy.

387
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,561
I'll give him a seven.

388
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:08,541
- You having a good time?
- Yes.

389
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,854
What have we here?

390
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,260
Oh, my god.

391
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,966
That son of a bitch.

392
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,892
She's nice.

393
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,564
Gentlemen, I think we got a winner here.

394
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,538
Berzin wins. Big Berzin.

395
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:42,735
Winner!

396
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:44,244
- Ten.
- Ten.

397
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,220
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

398
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,763
Jesus.

399
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,495
- How many points for that?
- Honorable mention.

400
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,471
Here's the man!

401
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:12,904
Where's the money?

402
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:13,998
Unbelievable.

403
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:17,610
Unbelievable, man.
Where the fuck did you find her?

404
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,340
That's top-fucking-secret.

405
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:22,815
Congratulations, you piece of shit.
God, was she butt-ugly.

406
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:25,079
A well-deserved win. That's four in a row.

407
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:28,987
Nobody in the entire fucking Marine Corps
ever won four in a row.

408
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:31,855
I'd say I'm one lucky motherfucker.

409
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,188
I think you're one lucky motherfucker.

410
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,961
- No hard feelings, Benjamin.
- Eat my ass.

411
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,126
Fuck you, too.

412
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:43,932
Oh, boy.

413
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,047
- Only $50?
- Cut me some slack, will you?

414
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,213
Slack? You find '"slack'" in the dictionary.

415
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,450
Between '"shit'" and '"syphilis.'"

416
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,493
Cab fare. I paid $8 for that cab.

417
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,960
Berzin, this ain't the chaplain
you're talking to.

418
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:11,829
You come to me for help. I help,
for half the money. That was the deal.

419
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,460
Don't give me shit about a fucking cab.

420
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:18,233
I'm not giving you shit, you goddamn slut.
Take your goddamn money.

421
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:20,467
You fucking asshole! God...

422
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:25,039
Fucking jarheads. You're all assholes.

423
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:34,781
What's wrong, Marcie?

424
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,654
The man's an asshole. That's what's wrong.

425
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,260
He says, '"Hey, Gums, how'd you like
to make $50...

426
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,787
'"...and you don't have to do nobody? '"
I say, '"What's the catch? '"

427
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,733
'"No catch.'" So he tells me
about this dogfight thing.

428
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:49,167
So I say, '"Sure.'"

429
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:51,671
I even offer not to wear my teeth.

430
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:55,299
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

431
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:59,371
Shit. Never mind.

432
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:09,990
No. I'd like to hear.

433
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,492
It's not really as bad as it sounds, all right?

434
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,325
Free cocktail, free beer...

435
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,456
...and they got to be polite.

436
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,763
Those are the rules. They got to be polite.

437
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:23,599
- What rules?
- The rules of the dogfight.

438
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:28,537
See, they each put in some money,
like $50, $70, $75...

439
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,702
Who does?

440
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:32,245
The assholes, the Marines.

441
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,380
And out of that they rent the joint,
pay for the food and the booze...

442
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,942
...and the rest of the money
goes to prize money.

443
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,922
The thing that gets me is how great
they think they look.

444
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,554
You ever seen such a pack of pukes?

445
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:47,788
There's prize money?

446
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:50,888
That's right.
The ugliest woman wins $100...

447
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,058
...for the guy who brings her.

448
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,793
I'm the ugliest, so I win.

449
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,600
Only, see...

450
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,902
...I ain't really that ugly. You should
see me when I'm really dressed up.

451
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,808
Oh, God. This is awful.

452
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,376
Marcie, you must feel terrible.

453
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:09,606
It's not so bad.

454
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,345
At least I got $50.

455
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,216
All you got was sick.

456
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:17,949
Hey!

457
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,226
- How you doing there, Shitbird?
- Good.

458
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,491
You just won honorable mention.

459
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,056
That's $26 in prize money.

460
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,099
It's a good thing she puked up
or we'd have to give it to Fector.

461
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:33,800
Hell of a lot better than a bayonet
up your ass.

462
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,739
Always.

463
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,668
Hey!

464
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:39,645
Don't you dare '"hey'" me.

465
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,239
You are a cruel, heartless, ignorant creep.

466
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,047
If I were a man, I'd beat you to a pulp.

467
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:48,882
Who gave you the right
to treat people like this?

468
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,288
It's vicious!

469
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,155
All of you are just vicious!

470
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:53,716
I'm sorry!

471
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:55,990
How can you be sorry?
You have no feelings.

472
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:59,192
You're just a worthless excuse
for a human being.

473
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,861
- Hey, that's my shipmate!
- Shut up, you creep!

474
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,137
Your apology means nothing.

475
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:07,140
Everything out of your mouth
has been rotten, dirty lies.

476
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:09,470
I'm sorry I ever met you.

477
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,238
Okay.

478
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,947
God, what a bitch.

479
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:16,382
Where did you find her?

480
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,577
Jerk!

481
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,378
For Christ's sakes.

482
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,115
What the hell was that about?

483
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,454
Jesus Christ!
You should be able to control your woman.

484
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,303
Rose.

485
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:48,304
What?

486
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,908
It's 8:30. What kind of party ends so early?

487
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,279
I decided to come home early.

488
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,552
You have a good time?

489
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:00,325
Yeah. It was nice.
I'm going to go practice my guitar.

490
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,124
Not too loud, okay?

491
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,711
Repent!

492
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:22,573
Hey, watch your step.

493
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,810
Repent!

494
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,681
Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.

495
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,553
Cartoons for adults!

496
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,529
I love winning, Corporal!
It feels so fucking good.

497
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,531
Here. I got you a beer.

498
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,302
Quit eye-fucking me.

499
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:49,400
Jesus!

500
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,207
They got these fucking things timed.

501
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,110
First it stops just when
she takes off her bra.

502
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,481
Now it stops just as she
takes off her panties.

503
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:59,281
That pisses me off.

504
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,150
Let's put on our hat.

505
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,481
Belly up to that holster.

506
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,216
You look like Daddy's little cowgirl.

507
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:09,094
Now, what's the most important thing
to remember...

508
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:10,562
...during a Wild West shootout?

509
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,723
Kill, kill, kill.

510
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,257
Right. Get in position.
Line that son of a bitch up.

511
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:17,133
- Draw!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

512
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:21,674
What are you doing?
Excuse me, ma'am. I got to talk to him.

513
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,842
- What's going on?
- The dogfight's over.

514
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,943
Okay, now half-mast those skivvies.

515
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:30,441
Bitch! Fucking machine!

516
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,246
What, you just learn to walk?

517
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,085
Okie, give me another nickel.

518
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,125
- All right, but I get to see, too.
- Okay.

519
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:40,057
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious. Give it to me.

520
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,755
Where did Birdlace go?

521
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,161
He said he'd meet us at Navy Bill's.

522
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:47,360
If I don't see her ass soon,
I'm going to hump you.

523
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:41,911
Dog!

524
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:57,604
Rosie, what is it? Who's out there?

525
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,072
It's all right. It's just Captain.

526
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,101
Here.

527
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:38,975
Come on.

528
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:40,636
Come on. Here.

529
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:45,479
Good boy. Yeah.
You're a big fucker, aren't you?

530
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,553
Yeah? Want some? Look at those ears.

531
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,847
Okay, easy.

532
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,151
Motherfucker!

533
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,668
What do you want?

534
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:55,444
Pretty hokey, isn't it?

535
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,448
Sorry. I thought you'd like it.

536
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,917
Did I win anything?

537
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,652
Nothing.

538
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,957
You were disqualified.

539
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:10,528
- Liar.
- Rose, I swear.

540
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,658
What about those other girls?

541
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,326
What about them?

542
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:19,134
What about their feelings? Do you honestly
think they have no feelings?

543
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:22,835
They didn't know anything about it.
Besides, you're different.

544
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:25,311
I've been to six different dogfights.

545
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,939
You're the first girl I ever tried to talk
out of going.

546
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:31,576
- You did not.
- Yes, ma'am. You don't remember?

547
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:34,052
In front of the Nitelite? I tried to stop you.

548
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:38,080
And before dancing, too.
When you dance, that's final judging.

549
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,952
That's crazy. I don't understand you.

550
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,426
There's a lot of shit I don't understand.

551
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,592
I don't apologize, ever.

552
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:50,796
And I came all the fuck way back here
to apologize.

553
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,964
And I don't understand that.

554
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,199
I wanted to take you out to dinner...

555
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:58,905
...and try to make things up to you
if possible...

556
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,709
...and I'm standing here now
feeling like an idiot.

557
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,272
So, fuck it.

558
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:07,550
If you don't want me around
and I'm a pain in your ass...

559
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:09,350
...just tell me to leave, and I'm gone.

560
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:13,518
I want you to stop swearing.

561
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:15,286
Okay.

562
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:20,525
Okay.

563
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:23,532
- Okay what?
- Okay, let's go to dinner.

564
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:26,637
But if this is part of your dogfight,
I'll kill you.

565
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:29,766
No, Rose, it's not.

566
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,780
I promise. It's just you and I
at a nice joint having a nice dinner.

567
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,316
We won't ever mention this dogfight again.

568
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,748
Roger that.

569
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:42,388
It'll just be like a regular date,
just two regular people on a regular date.

570
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:43,480
Right.

571
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,264
Well, knowing Birdlace,
he's probably out looking for action.

572
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:57,861
Speaking of action...

573
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,238
Can you believe it?

574
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:07,906
Two beautiful women lost
to a detachment of deck apes!

575
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:13,281
- Well, I thought I smelled squid shit.
- I smell it.

576
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,421
How'd you like to eat my shit?

577
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:19,288
Fucking jarhead.

578
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,321
Fight! Fight!

579
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:28,401
Market and Powell.

580
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,767
- Do we get off here?
- Yeah.

581
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,075
I think I know a place.

582
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,582
Here.

583
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:03,500
We can do better.

584
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:06,972
- Eddie, this is a nice restaurant.
- We can do better.

585
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:24,787
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Excuse me. Dinner for two.

586
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:28,191
- Do you have a reservation?
- Yes, my secretary called in. Gilmore.

587
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:32,456
Not that that should matter,
being there's plenty of room.

588
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:35,696
Yes, sir, there is,
but unless you have a jacket...

589
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:37,031
...I can't seat you.

590
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:38,469
I'm wearing a jacket.

591
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:40,473
You're wearing a windbreaker, sir.

592
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:44,841
I was speaking of a dinner jacket
or at least a tie and sports coat.

593
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,046
Couldn't you just put us in the back,
out of the way?

594
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:50,276
It's my last night stateside...

595
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:54,219
...and I wanted to take my girl
out to dinner.

596
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:57,416
I'm sorry, sir,
but it's a rule strictly enforced.

597
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:01,485
Well, thank you.

598
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,427
- That man's a prick!
- He was doing his job.

599
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,266
Bullshit! Just like a 2nd lieutenant,
give them some power...

600
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,965
...they roll in it like dogs in shit.

601
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,635
Makes them feel like wolves
instead of the little lap dog that he is.

602
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,337
I'm going to burn his ass.

603
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:22,548
Eddie, what is the problem?

604
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:25,483
We were supposed to have
a nice, normal date.

605
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:28,487
There's no problem.
Just a man with a mission.

606
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:29,988
What kind of mission?

607
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,060
You and me against the pricks.

608
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:36,721
Are you with me?

609
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:39,562
It has just been the craziest night.

610
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:43,364
Eddie's grandfather dies,
and we're headed for midnight mass.

611
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:45,098
Put that back where it belongs.

612
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:48,699
Eddie just doesn't have appropriate
funeral wear hanging in his closet.

613
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,244
I understand. But it's late. We were asleep.

614
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:53,439
I know, I'm very sorry, it's just...

615
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:56,449
We'd just like one jacket
so Eddie can look his best.

616
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,417
- Please, darling, hurry.
- Okay, darling.

617
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:00,476
I'm hurrying as fast as possible.

618
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:04,352
Eddie's having trouble making decisions.
He's shook up.

619
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,983
What the hell's going on?

620
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,852
They're going to a funeral.

621
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:14,092
Rose, that was outstanding bullshit.
I was really impressed.

622
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:17,433
It wasn't easy with you
throwing jackets all over.

623
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:26,369
Good evening. Dinner for two, please.

624
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,954
Thanks.

625
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:44,323
Look. It's so nice, so clean!

626
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:52,938
Rose, what do you think of this one?

627
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:56,339
Hey, friendly. Over here.
This will be just fine, thanks.

628
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:02,175
Please.

629
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:04,678
It's my pleasure.

630
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:06,946
Thank you so much.

631
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,722
You've been so wonderful.
This is for you. $1.

632
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,054
- That won't be necessary.
- Please, I insist!

633
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,321
You're worth $1. Isn't he?

634
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,830
See? You are worth $1.

635
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,595
Thank you so much for your time and effort.

636
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:31,742
Just wait till I'm through with him.
He won't know whether to shit or go blind.

637
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,610
You've had your fun.
Why do you have to do this?

638
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:39,909
Someone dumps on me five pounds,
I dump back fifty.

639
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,983
I'm not through with that jack-off, yet.

640
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:45,548
If you spend the night
making him miserable...

641
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:46,923
...I’m going home.

642
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,655
- What?
- I'm serious.

643
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:50,788
What are you talking about?

644
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:54,595
We came here to have a nice dinner.
And I'd like some respect from him.

645
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,363
You deserve respect, too.

646
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:58,962
We're paying just like everyone else.

647
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,673
That's how you get respect?

648
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:06,744
People are such goddamn idiots.

649
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:08,145
I know they are.

650
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:12,743
But what's the point of spending all your
energy trying to get even with everybody?

651
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:16,145
Because it feels great.
It feels fucking great, especially...

652
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:20,319
And what's the point of every word
out of your mouth being a curse word?

653
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:23,786
Are you ready to order now?

654
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,456
Yes, goddamn it.

655
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,563
I'm going to have
the fucking poached salmon...

656
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,561
...with the son-of-a-bitching rice...

657
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:36,375
...and a dirty-bastard salad...

658
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:39,503
...with a shitload of Roquefort dressing.

659
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:41,745
Thank you.

660
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,609
And who knows what this asshole wants.

661
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,916
I'll just take a fucking beer.

662
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:52,689
Thank you.

663
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:03,428
- That's all you're going to have, a beer?
- Yeah.

664
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:04,903
You must be starved.

665
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,002
No, I'm not starved.

666
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:13,912
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

667
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,949
I'll just put this over here for now.

668
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:18,211
Poached salmon and rice pilaf.

669
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:24,148
It's beautiful. Isn't this beautiful?

670
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:26,556
Yeah. That looks good, real good.

671
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:29,257
See, you are hungry.

672
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:32,992
Why didn't you order anything?

673
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,466
I couldn't pay for it.

674
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,335
I can pay for that, and for this,
but that's all till payday.

675
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,812
What's that for?

676
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:57,383
What are you doing?

677
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:07,093
Thanks.

678
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:14,203
I'm going to hit the head.

679
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:16,174
Okay I'll wait outside.

680
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,850
I know that he was so rude to you.

681
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,381
But I don't think it's fair
to prejudge people...

682
00:48:30,457 --> 00:48:32,857
...on how they look or how they're dressed.

683
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,518
Don't you think?

684
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,301
Thank you.

685
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,718
So, what are you grinning about?

686
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:04,820
I was wondering what you'd look like
with your hair a little longer, and without...

687
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:07,627
...that bruise on your face.

688
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:10,923
Well, not much better. That's for sure.

689
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,158
We've got a saying:

690
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:16,202
'"Shot at and missed. Shit at and hit.'"
That's me.

691
00:49:21,842 --> 00:49:24,367
So, I should take you home soon.

692
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,638
Right? It's kind of late.

693
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,448
I don't know.

694
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:35,119
I feel like walking. You feel like walking?

695
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:36,681
Sure.

696
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:43,122
Thanks for dinner.

697
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,991
- You're so welcome.
- It was really nice.

698
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,501
It's probably the most expensive meal
I ever had.

699
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,522
We had to relocate to Missouri.

700
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,392
Soon as I got there,
I tried to join the Air Force...

701
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,489
...but their recruiter was out to lunch.

702
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:23,662
The Marine Corps recruiter sees me
pacing there in the post office and says:

703
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:26,706
'"Eleanor Roosevelt was talking about you.'"

704
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,070
Eleanor Roosevelt?

705
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:32,202
Yeah. So I say, '"That's quite a trick,
seeing as she's dead.'"

706
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,270
He says, '"She said it before she died.

707
00:50:34,347 --> 00:50:39,284
'"She called you an oversexed, overtrained,
underfed, underpaid killing machine.'"

708
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:42,779
I thought he was crazy.
So I asked him, I said:

709
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:44,790
'"What the hell are you talking about? '"

710
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:48,487
He says, '"She was talking about Marines.

711
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:51,762
'"And you sure as hell
look like a Marine to me.'"

712
00:50:51,998 --> 00:50:53,966
I thought that was pretty neat.

713
00:50:54,034 --> 00:50:57,595
So I bolted home, got the old man,
brought him back...

714
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:01,300
...and he signed those papers so damn fast
he nearly sprained his wrist.

715
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:07,842
I was a little shit back then,
but I was only 16.

716
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:09,745
I don't think you're a little shit.

717
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,078
Gee, thanks.

718
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:18,182
- There you go.
- It's a beauty.

719
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,289
Out-fucking-standing.

720
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:23,054
I mean, out-fucking-standing!

721
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,222
Get up. Me next.

722
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,832
Okay, and remember...

723
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:31,894
...exact same bee
on the exact same spot for him.

724
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,228
Gotcha.

725
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,338
And remember, there's another one
of us coming. Birdlace.

726
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:38,809
He ain't here yet,
but exact same thing for him.

727
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,040
Same spot and same bee.

728
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:42,479
Yeah. Yeah.

729
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:44,546
'Cause there's four of us.

730
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:45,949
Four Bees.

731
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:49,881
There's Birdlace and Berzin.

732
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:51,719
My name's Buell.

733
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:55,421
Goddamn it, Okie! Leave the fucking guy
alone, for Christ's sakes.

734
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,386
He's Benjamin.

735
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,463
Eddie, will I get to see you some more?

736
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,731
I don't know. You want to?

737
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:10,034
Yeah.

738
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,544
Okay, then I'll take you out
as soon as I get back.

739
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:16,248
Get back from where?

740
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:19,046
Well, I'm shipping out
first thing tomorrow morning.

741
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,381
Going overseas.

742
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,185
- Where are you going?
- Okinawa.

743
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,651
But I'm aiming for this other place.

744
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,421
It's a little country near India
called Vietnam.

745
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:31,255
I read about it.

746
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:34,696
- Aren't they fighting there or something?
- No, not really.

747
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:39,501
We'll just be there as advisers
to teach them how to handle the Commies.

748
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,339
That could be dangerous.

749
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,340
No.

750
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,343
Kick a little ass, take a few names.

751
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,606
Be back in a couple of months.

752
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,574
Why didn't you tell me before
that you were leaving?

753
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,709
I thought it would sound like bullshit.

754
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:57,223
You know, something just to say
to get into your skivvies.

755
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:04,928
- Would you mind if I wrote you?
- Me? Hell, no. That would be great.

756
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:20,737
Want to go to this club in North Beach
called the Still Life Cafe?

757
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,939
I want to sing there one day.

758
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:25,484
When I write about it, you'll understand.

759
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:26,917
Yeah. Sure.

760
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,620
We don't have to. I thought it'd be nice,
but if you have to get back, that's okay.

761
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:35,422
As long as I'm back for formation
in the morning, it's fine.

762
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:39,323
Okay.

763
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:46,061
- You got to write me, too.
- I will.

764
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,441
You don't seem much
like the letter-writing kind.

765
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,578
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

766
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,676
I just don't like blood.

767
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,585
Sorry. I can't help it.

768
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:05,614
You sure you're okay?

769
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:07,221
I'm fine.

770
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:09,951
You'll be done soon, right?

771
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,157
Real soon. Looking nice.

772
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:14,629
I can't believe we finally did it.

773
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:17,101
We talked about getting these bees
for two months.

774
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:21,266
There you go. It's a bee. It's my bee.

775
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,071
My bee is smiling.

776
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,080
Berzin, your bee have a smile on his face?

777
00:54:29,249 --> 00:54:31,843
This one has a huge grin.
I don't think that's me.

778
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,377
You see the tits on this broad?

779
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:36,115
Nice pair.

780
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,622
This gonna look the same?

781
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,989
Exact same bee? Exact same spot?

782
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,627
Ever been with somebody
with tits like that?

783
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,096
- Sure. Haven't you?
- Yeah, sure.

784
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:48,564
- Really?
- Yes.

785
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:51,028
Okay.

786
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,869
- Okie, how you doing?
- No sweat.

787
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,135
Where's fucking Birdlace? It's his turn.

788
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:06,111
I tell you what. If Birdlace
doesn't show up, I'll get his for him.

789
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:09,178
So Jim Swaine doesn't exist.

790
00:55:09,255 --> 00:55:12,383
And you don't know
who Woody Guthrie is or Pete Seeger.

791
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,752
The only folk singers I know
is Peter, Paul and Mary.

792
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,298
- There they are now.
- Very funny.

793
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,130
Peter, Paul and Mary
are not real folk singers.

794
00:55:23,203 --> 00:55:24,192
- No?
- No.

795
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,869
Real folk singers write their own stuff.

796
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,601
They say what's on their minds.

797
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:31,644
- They can make things happen.
- How's that?

798
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:35,072
Their music can change the world.

799
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:36,648
If you want to change the world...

800
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:39,310
...why don't you join the Marines
and start shooting?

801
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:41,820
Shooting changes things real quick.

802
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,283
I can't believe you just said that.

803
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:46,954
- Well, I just did.
- That's ridiculous.

804
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:48,824
Shooting doesn't solve anything.

805
00:55:48,895 --> 00:55:51,693
You shoot at people,
people shoot back at you.

806
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:54,993
When you sing to people,
your message goes straight to the soul.

807
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:57,969
You open a new point of view.
You disarm them.

808
00:55:58,038 --> 00:56:02,441
All I know is that President Kennedy's
sending troops to make some changes...

809
00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:04,943
...and he certainly didn't issue them guitars.

810
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:08,208
There are people who use
music over aggression.

811
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,045
Ever heard the song We Shall Overcome?

812
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,912
What's so funny?

813
00:56:14,988 --> 00:56:17,013
What... Why are you laughing?

814
00:56:17,323 --> 00:56:19,314
- I'm not laughing.
- Yes, you are.

815
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:21,053
You think this is some joke?

816
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,527
You've never even heard this song.

817
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,657
Bullshit. Berzin goofs on it all the time.

818
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:29,561
That's funny.

819
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:33,066
All that proves
is that your friend is not only a cheat...

820
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,902
...but a complete moron.

821
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,335
What are you talking about?

822
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,408
Hey, Rose!

823
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:44,242
You just met the guy.
You're calling him a cheat?

824
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,115
He is a cheat. He didn't find Marcie.
He hired her.

825
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:49,519
- He even told her not to wear her teeth.
- Come on.

826
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:52,057
He did. I overheard them fighting about it.

827
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:54,116
He was trying to chisel her out of her share.

828
00:56:54,194 --> 00:56:57,129
He's not only a cheat and a moron,
he's a cheapskate.

829
00:56:57,797 --> 00:56:59,560
That son of a bitch.

830
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,428
Hey! Hold it.

831
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:06,436
What's going on here?

832
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,737
I ain't spending my last few hours stateside
arguing with you.

833
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:11,504
Especially you. I like you.

834
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:13,306
Damn it.

835
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,506
I'm sorry if...

836
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,985
I'm sorry if I upset you in any way.

837
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,422
That song is very important to me.
I don't like to see it ridiculed like that.

838
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:26,925
I understand that. I'm sorry.

839
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:29,985
I'm sorry.

840
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,224
I'm sorry.

841
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:34,232
No. I'm sorry, so shut up.

842
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,599
Thank you, but I'm really sorry,
so you shut up.

843
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,676
Yeah. Just give us the word,
and we're there.

844
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:48,941
- Just the two of you?
- Just the two of us.

845
00:57:49,516 --> 00:57:51,541
She sings, I play, and...

846
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:53,347
Hey, Bob.

847
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:57,915
- I'm just going to show him around, okay?
- Sure.

848
00:57:58,324 --> 00:57:59,757
Where did you play?

849
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:03,994
We played over at Rudy's
a couple weeks ago. They really dug us.

850
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,553
So this is it.

851
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:07,756
You guys have a manager?

852
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:08,801
No.

853
00:58:09,202 --> 00:58:11,693
- Well, it's interesting. It's nice.
- Yeah.

854
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:14,331
- You ever sing here?
- No.

855
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,742
I'm waiting for my hair to get longer
and write my own stuff.

856
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:20,676
Then I'll be ready to hoot.

857
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,711
Hoot? What's that?

858
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:24,579
Short for hootenanny.

859
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,217
Every Tuesday night,
anybody can come up on stage and sing...

860
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:31,052
...and if Bob likes them,
he might ask them back...

861
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:33,456
...or give them a gig or something.

862
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:36,655
- Why don't you sing something?
- What?

863
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:38,959
Yeah. Sing something, like...

864
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:42,967
Like that song you sang earlier at the cafe.

865
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,935
I don't know that song very well.

866
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:48,906
That's okay.
I just want to see you up there.

867
00:58:57,684 --> 00:58:58,878
Well...

868
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:02,547
You've got the stage.
You've got me as the audience.

869
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:04,782
So why don't you just sing?

870
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,486
Please?

871
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:13,857
Okay.

872
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,004
I don't know piano all that well.

873
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:22,468
That's okay.

874
00:59:27,413 --> 00:59:29,643
I'll just play it very simply.

875
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:31,181
That's fine.

876
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:33,443
Okay.

877
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,636
Rose, lock your eyes on their numskulls
and brain them!

878
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,872
Yeah!

879
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:59,730
See, I think that you're going to like this.

880
01:05:04,216 --> 01:05:07,083
Advertisers have found
that the women of America...

881
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,748
...are keenly interested
in the type of soap they use.

882
01:05:11,624 --> 01:05:15,060
In fact, the men of America
have a keen interest in the product...

883
01:05:15,127 --> 01:05:17,095
...and how it is used also.

884
01:05:37,049 --> 01:05:39,711
The outboard motor has brought a
renewed interest...

885
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:41,946
...in water sports in this country.

886
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:44,316
Outstanding liberty, isn't it?

887
01:05:45,591 --> 01:05:46,922
Out-fucking-standing.

888
01:05:46,993 --> 01:05:48,927
...lakes and streams for exercise...

889
01:06:03,743 --> 01:06:06,712
I guess I should go.
You got to get up early in the morning.

890
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:09,004
Yeah. You, too.

891
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,307
Yeah.

892
01:06:10,616 --> 01:06:12,516
So I'll just leave now.

893
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:18,113
Or, you could...

894
01:06:18,357 --> 01:06:20,154
...come in for a minute.

895
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,088
You think so?

896
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:24,129
Yeah, for a little while, if you want.

897
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:26,695
I'd love to.

898
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:28,923
Okay, let's go.

899
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,327
Okay.

900
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,230
Is she sleeping?

901
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,999
Yeah. She always sleeps with the TV on.

902
01:08:19,044 --> 01:08:20,443
Do you want to hear some music?

903
01:08:22,782 --> 01:08:23,874
Sure.

904
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,841
Who are these people?

905
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:59,849
Okay. This is Malvina Reynolds.

906
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:03,184
She's the one who wrote the song
that I sang today.

907
01:09:03,522 --> 01:09:05,046
And, and...

908
01:09:05,124 --> 01:09:06,682
That's Woody Guthrie.

909
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,727
And that's Pete Seeger.

910
01:09:08,794 --> 01:09:10,421
That's Joan Baez.

911
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,520
She's my favorite.

912
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,264
And there's Bob Dylan.

913
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:17,364
You know him, right?

914
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:21,164
And that's Odetta.
She has the most beautiful voice.

915
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:23,935
And...

916
01:09:25,144 --> 01:09:27,578
Sorry, no pictures of Jim Swaine.

917
01:09:42,294 --> 01:09:44,228
Do you want to play musical bingo?

918
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:48,063
- Sure.
- Okay.

919
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:51,928
It's really fun.

920
01:09:52,872 --> 01:09:53,861
Okay.

921
01:09:56,475 --> 01:09:58,568
Okay. You can be the maestro...

922
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:01,470
...and you get 12 chips.

923
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:03,674
Here. You can count those out.

924
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:06,047
And I'll get 12, and...

925
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:08,110
Is this like bingo?

926
01:10:10,823 --> 01:10:12,347
It's a musical bingo.

927
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:15,054
I can't play bingo.

928
01:10:16,262 --> 01:10:17,752
- No?
- No.

929
01:10:18,898 --> 01:10:19,990
Okay.

930
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,168
We don't have to play bingo.

931
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:27,262
No.

932
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,120
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

933
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,284
Yeah?

934
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,689
Do you think I should change maybe?

935
01:11:25,297 --> 01:11:26,628
Should I change?

936
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:28,157
Yeah?

937
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:30,328
Okay. I'll change.

938
01:11:31,603 --> 01:11:32,900
My nightgown.

939
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:35,736
And I'll just... I'll go in here and change.

940
01:12:59,024 --> 01:13:00,514
You look good.

941
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:11,836
- You look real good.
- Thank you.

942
01:13:20,412 --> 01:13:22,380
Sorry. The bed's small.

943
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,733
Couldn't we just...

944
01:14:34,019 --> 01:14:35,680
Here's my address.

945
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:48,890
You can write if you want.

946
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:52,702
Take care of yourself.

947
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:55,030
Okay.

948
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,008
Goodbye, Eddie.

949
01:15:02,381 --> 01:15:03,439
'Bye.

950
01:16:02,374 --> 01:16:04,501
How about a dime for coffee?

951
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:22,021
- Corporal Birdlace reporting for duty.
- Where the hell have you been?

952
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:23,186
Yeah.

953
01:16:24,263 --> 01:16:26,390
I don't know. I forget.

954
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:28,697
I look a lot better than you.

955
01:16:28,767 --> 01:16:29,756
What happened?

956
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,860
We had a pisser of a time.

957
01:16:32,037 --> 01:16:34,403
Tangled assholes with some squid.

958
01:16:34,606 --> 01:16:38,064
Went to a skin flick,
met a very sensitive woman.

959
01:16:38,143 --> 01:16:42,341
She did the three of us for $10.
And before that, we got a tattoo.

960
01:16:42,414 --> 01:16:43,574
- A bee.
- Check it out.

961
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:46,049
A bee for the Four Bees.
What do you think?

962
01:16:46,285 --> 01:16:47,616
I like it, it's nice.

963
01:16:47,786 --> 01:16:49,447
Berzin got yours for you.

964
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,046
Show him, Berz.

965
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:00,660
Fuck off.

966
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:05,363
That's pretty.

967
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:06,630
You owe me a bee.

968
01:17:06,838 --> 01:17:08,999
Attention, all military personnel.

969
01:17:09,074 --> 01:17:10,974
The shuttle for Treasure Island departs...

970
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,305
Let's go.

971
01:17:17,783 --> 01:17:20,013
So? You going to tell us or what?

972
01:17:20,085 --> 01:17:21,712
Spit it out, Birdlegs.

973
01:17:21,787 --> 01:17:23,516
I told her I wouldn't tell no one.

974
01:17:23,588 --> 01:17:25,988
Come on, you asshole. We tell you.

975
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,851
Keep it down. She was married.

976
01:17:30,929 --> 01:17:33,625
Married? She was married?
You fuck! She was married.

977
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:36,361
Outstanding, Corporal.
Out-fucking-standing.

978
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:38,733
You know what they say. Married's best.

979
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:40,795
'"They don't tell, they don't swell.'"

980
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:41,861
Good-looking?

981
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,465
Oh, yeah. 32, blond, built like a...

982
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:47,136
32? What are you, some grandma-fucker?

983
01:17:47,212 --> 01:17:50,340
If the grandmother looked like this,
you bet your ass.

984
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,349
She was real good-looking.

985
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,406
She couldn't get enough.

986
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,919
Her old man didn't give her attention.
Probably a fag.

987
01:17:55,987 --> 01:17:58,751
What do you expect
from a lieutenant commander in personnel?

988
01:17:58,824 --> 01:18:01,884
An officer's wife!
That's out-fucking-standing!

989
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:11,466
You know what, Berzin?
I think you and me are full of shit.

990
01:18:11,536 --> 01:18:13,663
Come on, Birdlace. What's your beef?

991
01:18:15,574 --> 01:18:19,169
That toothless sack of shit
that you took to the party...

992
01:18:19,244 --> 01:18:20,711
The dogfight.

993
01:18:21,747 --> 01:18:23,715
That was a setup, right?

994
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,342
What makes you think that?

995
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:31,781
I wasn't out with the officer's wife
last night.

996
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,381
I was out with Rose. She told me.

997
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:38,822
I figured she was going to do that.

998
01:18:41,533 --> 01:18:46,561
I saw you with her last night in Chinatown
while we were getting our bees put on.

999
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:48,367
You're shitting me.

1000
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,268
- Fucking A.
- I won't tell them.

1001
01:18:53,044 --> 01:18:56,138
Just like you won't tell them
I fixed the fight, right?

1002
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:01,078
How did we get to be so full of shit?

1003
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,186
I mean, how did we become
these fucking idiots?

1004
01:19:04,256 --> 01:19:08,784
I was sitting here thinking about it, and...
Fuck it.

1005
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:11,021
I guess I don't know what started it all.

1006
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:12,893
- Yeah. Forget about it.
- Right.

1007
01:19:12,964 --> 01:19:14,955
- Go back to sleep.
- Right.

1008
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:18,062
It ain't worth it.

1009
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,999
So you won the dogfight fair and square...

1010
01:19:22,073 --> 01:19:25,304
...and I was dating the officer's wife
for one night.

1011
01:19:26,445 --> 01:19:28,970
- Roger that, Corporal.
- Bullshit.

1012
01:19:29,714 --> 01:19:31,375
See what I mean?

1013
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,542
I do.

1014
01:19:33,385 --> 01:19:35,615
Let me tell you something about bullshit.

1015
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,514
It's everywhere.

1016
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:41,114
You hit me with a little, I buy it.

1017
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,418
I hit you with a little, you buy it.

1018
01:19:43,895 --> 01:19:45,920
It doesn't make us idiots.

1019
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,194
That's what makes us buddies.

1020
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,761
We buy what the Corps hands out,
and that's what makes us Marines.

1021
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:55,905
And the Corps is buying the bullshit
from Kennedy...

1022
01:19:55,974 --> 01:20:00,070
...and Kennedy's buying the bullshit
from everybody in the US of fuckin' A.

1023
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,203
And that's what makes us Americans.

1024
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:07,210
- It's still bullshit.
- Right.

1025
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:10,345
And we're in it
up to our goddamn lips, buddy.

1026
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:12,384
See what I'm saying?

1027
01:20:12,757 --> 01:20:15,055
Berzin, you can make sense out of anything.

1028
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,297
I don't know if I'm making sense, but...

1029
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:25,168
This makes a hell of a lot of sense
to me, boy.

1030
01:20:26,137 --> 01:20:28,264
There's no bullshit in this.

1031
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,035
Jesus.

1032
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:35,338
Very fucking charming, Okie.
Very fucking charming.

1033
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,608
Was that the Okie aroma I smell?

1034
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:40,583
Hey, Birdshit, tell me again,
was she a fox or what?

1035
01:20:40,652 --> 01:20:42,552
- What?
- You know, the officer's wife.

1036
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:44,748
How good-looking was she?

1037
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:46,757
- Tell me.
- All right. Tell him.

1038
01:20:46,825 --> 01:20:49,123
I'll tell you this, you sorry son of a bitch.

1039
01:20:49,194 --> 01:20:52,493
She was so fine,
you'd crawl through a minefield...

1040
01:20:52,564 --> 01:20:56,295
...just to smell the tires on the laundry
truck hauling away her skivvies.

1041
01:20:56,368 --> 01:20:58,063
Get out of here!

1042
01:21:00,138 --> 01:21:01,400
Get off of me!

1043
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:02,962
Hey, come on!

1044
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:04,201
Watch my hair!

1045
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:49,714
- Daley.
- Here.

1046
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:51,483
- Erlich.
- Here.

1047
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:53,183
- Bailey.
- Here.

1048
01:21:53,258 --> 01:21:54,850
- Riker.
- Here.

1049
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:56,223
- Lincoln.
- Here.

1050
01:21:56,294 --> 01:21:57,784
- Sanders.
- Here.

1051
01:21:57,862 --> 01:21:59,420
- Sarnof.
- Here.

1052
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:00,987
- Tate.
- Here.

1053
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,702
We have NBC's Bob MacNeil on the line
now with a report. Please go ahead, Bob.

1054
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:09,498
White House Press Secretary
Malcolm Kilduff...

1055
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:13,176
...has just announced
that President Kennedy...

1056
01:22:16,615 --> 01:22:20,881
...died at approximately 1:00 Central
Standard Time, just about 35 minutes ago.

1057
01:22:20,952 --> 01:22:23,580
- After being shot at...
- After being shot...

1058
01:22:23,655 --> 01:22:26,647
...by an unknown assailant...
...by an unknown assailant...

1059
01:22:26,725 --> 01:22:29,558
...during a motorcade ride
through downtown Dallas.

1060
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:32,358
...during a motorcade ride
through downtown Dallas.

1061
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,058
- The president died...
- The president died...

1062
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:38,694
...approximately 25 minutes...
...approximately 25 minutes...

1063
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,274
I'll see your four...

1064
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:47,140
...and raise you five.

1065
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,804
Y'all want to hear a joke?

1066
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,507
That's it. I won.

1067
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,843
What's this shit?

1068
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:55,609
- Want to hear a joke?
- What are you trying to pull?

1069
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:58,053
- You think I'm stupid.
- Tell the fucking joke.

1070
01:22:58,289 --> 01:23:00,723
What did the ghost say to the bee?

1071
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:03,825
I don't know.

1072
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,624
'"Boo, bee. Boo, bee.'"

1073
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:11,296
Actually, that's pretty good.

1074
01:23:11,369 --> 01:23:12,734
That's real funny, Okie.

1075
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:25,548
My knee!

1076
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:27,308
I've been hit.

1077
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:32,848
- I need help!
- My fucking arm!

1078
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:35,650
Benjamin!

1079
01:23:35,894 --> 01:23:39,295
He's dead! He's dead!
The motherfucker's dead!

1080
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:40,558
Where's Benjamin?

1081
01:23:40,632 --> 01:23:43,192
Eddie, don't you fucking give up on me!

1082
01:23:47,472 --> 01:23:49,099
San Francisco.

1083
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:51,434
Watch your step getting off.

1084
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:25,909
So, thanks for coming, folks.

1085
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:30,212
Hey, man, how many babies did you kill?

1086
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:32,909
We're having Big Brother
and the Holding Company.

1087
01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:36,381
A benefit
for the Haight Community free clinic.

1088
01:24:38,189 --> 01:24:40,919
Check it out before the prices go up.

1089
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,109
He had a scorpion on his back.

1090
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:01,645
A tattoo, like this big.

1091
01:25:01,713 --> 01:25:04,113
It was one of those T-shirts with no sleeves.

1092
01:25:04,783 --> 01:25:06,444
How are you doing?

1093
01:25:07,051 --> 01:25:09,144
Let me have a CC and water.

1094
01:25:10,722 --> 01:25:13,384
- Yeah, I think Karl wants one, too.
- Right.

1095
01:25:13,992 --> 01:25:17,086
- I can't afford one. Give me a raise.
- Yeah.

1096
01:25:21,232 --> 01:25:22,961
Runner on at first.

1097
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:25,932
That'll be $1.10.

1098
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:28,938
Here's $2. Keep the change.

1099
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:30,501
Thanks.

1100
01:25:31,743 --> 01:25:34,211
- That's nice. It do anything?
- What?

1101
01:25:34,512 --> 01:25:35,945
The bluebirds.

1102
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:39,810
It didn't take me where it was supposed to,
but it still flies.

1103
01:25:40,652 --> 01:25:42,847
We were just talking about tattoos.

1104
01:25:47,258 --> 01:25:48,623
Nice bees.

1105
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,256
You just get them?

1106
01:25:51,796 --> 01:25:53,787
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1107
01:25:54,699 --> 01:25:56,291
I got one that dances.

1108
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:58,962
The man doesn't want
to see your belly.

1109
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:01,631
All I said was I got one that dances.

1110
01:26:02,373 --> 01:26:04,568
Believe me, it's no big deal.

1111
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:06,399
Let me see it.

1112
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,288
For crying out loud.

1113
01:26:27,365 --> 01:26:29,560
You get it? Belly dancer?

1114
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:35,739
Hey, I got it in TJ.

1115
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:38,170
You ever been to TJ?

1116
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:39,368
Yeah.

1117
01:26:39,677 --> 01:26:42,976
I got this one in Dego
after I got out of boot camp.

1118
01:26:43,548 --> 01:26:45,106
You a Marine?

1119
01:26:45,483 --> 01:26:46,472
Yes, sir.

1120
01:26:47,252 --> 01:26:49,049
- Vietnam?
- Yeah.

1121
01:26:49,754 --> 01:26:51,244
Yeah. Bummer.

1122
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,232
No charge on that, Karl.

1123
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:12,668
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1124
01:27:26,724 --> 01:27:29,192
Boy, things have really changed
around here.

1125
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,455
Yeah. You can say that again.

1126
01:27:31,796 --> 01:27:33,093
You ain't kidding.

1127
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:36,065
Rose still run that place
across the street, the cafe?

1128
01:27:37,201 --> 01:27:39,169
There's been a couple of Roses.

1129
01:27:39,237 --> 01:27:44,140
Yeah, but I think they're grooming
a granddaughter of hers now.

1130
01:27:44,475 --> 01:27:47,911
I think I've seen the granddaughter before.
She's kind of chubby?

1131
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:50,379
Chubby? She ain't no prize.

1132
01:27:51,115 --> 01:27:53,675
Like you're some kind of winner, Karl?

1133
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:55,275
I am a lover.

1134
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:01,553
A lover?

1135
01:29:19,837 --> 01:29:20,929
Rose?

1136
01:29:36,921 --> 01:29:37,853
Hi.

1137
01:29:38,823 --> 01:29:39,847
Hi.
