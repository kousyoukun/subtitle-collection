133
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:56,186
请别停下,你听起来很不错.
Please. Don't stop. You sound real good.

134
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,355
真的很棒.这是我最爱的歌之一.
It's great. It's one of my favorite songs.

135
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:02,092
实际上,让我想起...
Actually, it reminds me a lot of...

136
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,068
很多吉姆斯恩的歌.
,Of Jim Swaine's music.

137
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:06,659
你不这样认为吗?
Don't you think so?

138
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,295
我不认识他.
I don't know him.

139
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,430
哇哦.吉姆斯恩不认识?
Wow. Jim Swaine?

140
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,704
呃,他就是...
Well, he's just...

141
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,408
好吧,你总听说过迪伦吧?鲍勃迪伦?
Well, you've heard of Dylan, right?
Bob Dylan?

142
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:19,676
听说过.
Yeah.

143
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,310
吉姆斯恩对迪伦的音乐有很大的影响.
Jim Swaine is a major influence
on Dylan's music.

144
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,587
我还以为...
I thought...

145
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,988
...伍迪加斯里才是影响了迪伦的那个人.
...Woody Guthrie was Dylan's influence.

146
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,025
呃,也是啊.
Well, yeah.

147
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,926
先是伍迪,然后才是吉姆斯恩.
There's Woody,
and then there's Jim Swaine.

148
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,259
事实上,我觉得吉姆斯恩和合写了一些歌.
In fact, I think that Jim Swaine and Woody
cowrote some songs together.

149
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,527
如果我没记错的话.
If I'm not mistaken.

150
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:42,171
我以为伍迪自己创作了很多.
I thought Woody wrote pretty much
on his own.

151
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:45,404
有时候是的,他是写了很多,绝对的.
Sometimes he did. He did, most definitely.

152
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,805
不过有时候,他会,你知道的,和斯恩合作一下.
But sometimes, he would, you know,
collaborate with Swaine.

153
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:52,640
换句话来说,伍迪写歌词,斯恩来配曲.
In other words, Woody wrote the words,
and Swaine wrote the music.

154
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:55,844
其他时候,他们会换一下,知道我在说什么吗?
Other times, they'd switch.
See what I'm saying?

155
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,112
就像他的那首著名的歌曲.
Like that famous song of his.

156
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,156
你知道我说的是哪首吗?
You know the one I mean?

157
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,859
-这个岛屿属于你?-正是"这个岛屿属于你."
- This Land Is Your Land?
- This Land Is Your Land. Exactly.

158
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,121
噢,那个...
Yeah, that was...

159
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:10,632
那首是斯恩和加斯林的原创歌曲.
That was an original
by Swaine and Guthrie.

160
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:11,895
真奇怪.
That's strange.

161
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:16,464
我楼上有些乐谱,可是我不记得有看到过他的名字.
I've got the sheet music upstairs.
I don't remember seeing his name.

162
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,108
他曾是个代笔写手,有的时候.
He was a ghostwriter. Sometimes.

163
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:22,502
实际上,大多数时候.
In fact, most of the time.

164
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:26,944
萝斯,你休息时间结束了,把这些桌子收拾收拾.
Rose, your break's over.
Let's get those tables set up for tomorrow.

165
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,044
你的咖啡要凉掉了.
Your coffee's getting cold.

166
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,451
谢谢.
Thank you.

167
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,650
你自己也写歌么
?Do you write your own stuff?

168
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:39,127
啊天啊,不.
Jeez, no.

169
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,630
你应该写写.你有副好嗓子.
You should. You've got the voice for it.

170
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,791
-真的?-她妈的当然了.
- Really?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

171
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,904
嘿,对不起.
Hey. My apologies.

172
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,108
我还不怎么懂得和女士相处.
I'm not used to being around ladies.

173
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,904
没关系.我得回去工作了.
It's okay. I should get back to work.

174
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:55,670
行.
Sure.

175
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:01,708
听着,我只是个愚蠢的锅盖头.
Listen, I'm just a dumb jarhead.

176
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,013
对不起.
I am sorry.

177
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,348
没关系.
It's okay.

178
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,091
那你们几点关门?
So what time do you close up here?

179
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,054
快了,再一会儿.
In a little while.

180
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,128
什么是锅盖头?
What's a jarhead?

181
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:20,759
那只是我们对自己的称呼.我是个美国海军陆战队员.
That's just what we call ourselves.
I'm a United States Marine.

182
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:23,966
我们这么说说是没事的,但是如果一个乌贼这么说,一个水手...
It's okay if we say it,
but if a squid says it, a sailor...

183
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,508
...那就要引起一场打斗了.
...then it's fist city.

184
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:29,672
不过要是女人这么说完全没问题,特别是一个能像你这样唱歌的.
It's all right if a woman says it,
especially if she sings like you.

185
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,178
谢谢.
Thanks.

186
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,010
非常感谢...
Thanks very much...

187
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,874
...锅盖头.
...jarhead.

188
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:43,850
-那么,你叫什么名字?-萝斯,萝斯范尼.
- So, what's your name?
- Rose, Rose Fenny.

189
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,527
萝斯咖啡馆.这是你开的店?
Rose's cafe. You own this place.

190
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:49,024
不,我妈妈的,她的名字也叫萝斯.
No. My mother does. Her name's Rose.

191
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,533
跟我一样,我外婆也是.
Same as me, same as my grandmother.

192
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,201
那很不错.
That's nice.

193
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,940
-你是个海军陆战队员?-是的,女士.
- You're a Marine?
- Yes, ma'am.

194
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,347
爱德华贝恩斯博雷斯?
Edward Baines Birdlace?

195
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,979
好吧,没那么好笑啦.
Okay. It's not that funny.

196
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,848
对不起,这名字还不错.
Sorry. It's a nice name.

197
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,114
谢了.
Thanks.

198
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,423
天啊,你看起来好凶悍.
Gosh, you look so angry.

199
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,618
我不是凶悍.我只是时刻准备着.
I'm not angry. I'm just ready.

200
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:18,985
为什么而准备?
Ready for what?

201
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:21,487
为一切.
Ready for anything.

202
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,427
生日:1944年11月26日.
Date of birth: November 26, 1944.

203
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:28,471
那很快就到了嘛.今天已经21号了.
That's soon. Today's the 21st.

204
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,564
在这星期一.19岁大生日.

205
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,609
噢,生日快乐,博雷斯下士.
Well, happy birthday, Corporal Birdlace.

206
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:35,743
哎呀,谢谢.
Gee, thanks.

207
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:43,877
我最好赶紧撤了,得去个派对.
I better shove off soon. Going to a party.

208
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,319
生日派对?
Birthday party?

209
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,017
不,就是个...寻常的派对.
No, just... Sort of a regular party.

210
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,717
嘿,也许你愿意跟我一块去不.
Say, maybe you'd like to go with me.

211
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:56,064
实际上,我还在工作呢.
Actually, I'm still working.

212
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,033
行,好吧.我理解.
Sure. Right. I understand.

213
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,633
不,我得在这呆到今晚关门为止.
No. I've got to be here till closing tonight.

214
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:03,297
萝斯,听着.
Rose, listen.

215
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:06,501
我是个海军陆战队员,还困陆战队的都是混蛋,大家都知道这一点.
I'm a Marine and Marines are jerks.
Everybody knows that.

216
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:09,546
如果你不想跟我一块去,就直说好了.
If you don't want to go with me, just say so.

217
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,781
只是...我妈就得一个人了.
It's just... My mom would be alone.

218
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:18,019
呃,我也不想给任何人带来麻烦,那么...
Well, I don't want to get anyone in trouble
with their old lady, so...

219
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,729
很高兴认识你,萝斯.很高兴认识你.
It was nice to have met you, Rose.
Nice to have met you.

220
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:28,856
再见.
'Bye.

221
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:35,897
萝斯?
Rose?

222
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:39,603
你唱得真的很好.
You sing real good.

223
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,207
相当好.
Real good.

224
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:48,843
妈的.
Shit.

225
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,789
你快做完了吗,亲爱的?
You almost done, honey?

226
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:57,758
这是什么,星期三?不知道今晚电视上会放什么.
What is this, Wednesday?
I wonder what's on TV tonight.

227
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,921
我们下楼去看点好看的节目.
We'll go upstairs
and watch something nice.

228
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,863

00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:11,832
-走开点.-埃迪!

- Eddie!

231
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,133
我和你一块去好吗?
I'm going with you, okay?

232
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,069
棒极了.
This is great.

233
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,014
太好了.
It's great.

234
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,381
-你妈怎么办?-没事的
- What about your mother?
- What about her?

235
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,186
好极了.

236
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:26,415
我现在先去换下衣服.

- Yes, a dress-up party.

239
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,521
好的.
Okay.

240
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:36,996
听着,萝斯,要不把你的吉他也带上吧?
Listen, Rose, why don't you bring
your guitar along?

241
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,192
我还没准备好在一群人面前唱呢.
I'm not ready to sing in front
of an audience.

242
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:43,404
也行,你能去就已经很好了.
That's fine, too.
It'll be great just to have you along.

243
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:49,869
-萝斯?-我要去个派对,好吗?
- Rosie?
- I'm going to a party, okay?

244
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,944
-还有很多活呢.-我明天开张前会做的.
- There's still all this work.
- I'll do it before we open.

245
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:55,916
萝斯...
Rose...

246
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,917
我保证.
I promise.

247
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,426
老天啊.
Jesus God.

248
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,160
你看起来很漂亮.
You look great.

249
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:55,460
是吗?
Yeah?

250
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:57,104
棒极了。
Outstanding.

251
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,434
谢谢、
Thanks.

252
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:08,049
真高兴我最终决定去了。
I'm really glad I decided to come.

253
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:09,808
是啊，好极了，我也很高兴。
Oh, great. Me, too.

254
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,116
能暂时远离餐馆感觉真好。
It's nice to get away from the restaurant...

255
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:13,417
...远离我妈
...from my mom.

256
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,153
我并不是讨厌她什么的.只是她的一生都投入到那家餐馆里去了.
I don't hate her or anything.
It's just, her whole life's the restaurant.

257
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:18,990
而我不想也那样.
I don't want it to be like that.

258
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:21,394
这一点也不能怪你.
I don't blame you a bit.

259
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,226
咪咪的烦恼.
The Trouble with Mimi.

260
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:26,864
-你看过这个吗?-我不怎么去电影院.
- Did you see this?
- I don't go to flicks much.

261
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:29,167
这种片子能把我逼疯.
This kind of thing drives me crazy.

262
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:34,006
有些人在为了生存和自由而斗争...
There are people right now, fighting
for their lives and for their freedom...

263
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:38,138
...当我们在这里看那些毫无意义的垃圾的时候.
...while here we are watching this trash
which doesn't mean anything.

264
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:41,545
-那你为毛还看?-我妈呗.
- Then why did you see it?
- My mom.

265
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,245
她爱死这片子了.
She loved it.

266
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,450
我们最近经常意见不合.她很容易满足,你知道的,就这么过日子.
We don't agree on anything lately.
She's content, you know, living her life.

267
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,118
可我不想...
I don't want to...

268
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:53,118
我想对这个世界有所影响.
I want to have an effect on the world.

269
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,824
我想脱离这里,融入到其他环境中去.
I want to get out there and get involved.

270
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,993
你懂的,我想加入和平卫队...
You know, I'd like to join the Peace Corps...

271
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:01,970
...或者可能下到南部去帮助那里...
...or maybe go down south
and help out there...

272
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,204
我不知道.
I don't know.

273
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:06,469
这真是让人无奈.
It's just so frustrating.

274
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,970
恩,我理解你的意思.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

275
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,739
-真高兴我来了.-我也很高兴.
- I'm really glad I decided to come.
- Me, too.

276
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:16,377
能跟人聊天感觉真好.真的很好.
It's really nice to talk to someone.
It's really nice.

277
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:17,613
那是啊.
It is.

278
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:20,013
大型派对!
Big party!

279
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,888
萝斯,你的嘴唇长的很好看.
Rose, you got really nice lips.

280
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:23,983
什么?
What?

281
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,961
你嘴唇长的很好看.你涂口红了吗?
You got nice lips. Are you wearing lipstick?

282
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,724
是啊.-是吗?
- Yes.
- Yeah?

283
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:30,732
好像有点褪掉了,我看看.
It's kind of wearing down, I see.

284
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,629
-有吗?-有一点点,带唇膏了吗?
- It is?
- A little bit. Got more?

285
00:20:32,702 --> 00:20:34,693
-我该补补吗?-当然.
- Should I put some more on?
- Sure.

286
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,863
好的.
Okay.

287
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:42,843
让我来试试.
Let me try.

288
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,412
-可以吗?-行啊.
- Can I, please?
- Okay.

289
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,355
埃迪...
Eddie...

290
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:53,650
别动.
Hold still.

291
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:55,054
埃迪...
Eddie...

292
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:59,793
你涂唇膏涂得跟我差不多好.
You put on lipstick about as good as I do.

293
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:02,764
你该把唇膏涂在嘴唇上.
You're supposed to put lipstick on the lips.

294
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,493
全涂到我的...
It's all over my...

295
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,793
现在全涂到我的嘴巴外边了.
It's all over my mouth now.

296
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,998
等下,也许我可以修整好.
Wait. Maybe I can fix this.

297
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,276
全涂出来了.
It's all over the place.

298
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,871
好了,现在好了,对吗?
There. That's fine, right?

299
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,814
算了，别管了。
Never mind. Forget about it.

300
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:21,316
你看起来不错的。
You look fine.

301
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:22,908
你觉得我看起来好吗？
You think I look okay?

302
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:24,476
很好的。
It's all right.

303
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:27,990
...夜光俱乐部...
'"The Nitelite.'"

304
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:30,590
哇哦.看起来像是个相当不错的地方,哈?
Wow. Looks like a pretty fancy place, huh?

305
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,824
萝斯,这个派对其实没什么意思,我们没必要非得进去...
Rose, this party's no big deal.
We don't have to go in...

306
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:36,092
我想去.
I'd like to. Yeah.

307
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,101
我们可以去别的地方的,如果你只是想跳舞.
We can go somewhere else
if you just want to dance.

308
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:40,901
没事的.
That's okay.

309
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:43,634
好吧,来吧.
All right, come on.

310
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:46,841
-拿去吧,伙计.-谢谢.
- There you go, buddy.
- Thanks.

311
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:49,812
你的朋友吗?
Friend of yours?

312
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:51,141
来吧.
Come on.

313
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,786
晚上好啊,博雷斯下士.晚上好,女士.
Good evening, Corporal Birdlace.
Good evening, ma'am.

314
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:01,346
你找了个不错的女伴嘛,下士.
Fine woman you got there, Corporal.

315
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:04,621
我确定会把这个加到给检察长的报告里的.
I'll be sure to include this in my report
to the inspector general.

316
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:07,288
-谢谢,长官.-好运,下士.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck, Corporal.

317
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:08,922
等下.
Wait a second.

318
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:12,096
-我只是想....-你看起来很棒.
- I just want to...
- You look great.

319
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:14,835
-真的吗?真的,
- Really?
- Really. You do.

320
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,139
-好吧.-让我们进去吧.
- Okay.
- Let's hit it.

321
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,108
你想要一个派对,这就给你个派对.
You want a party? You got yourself a party.

322
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:33,887
-嘿,博雷斯!-嘿,扎沃斯基!
- Hey, Birdlace!
- Hey, Zaworsky!

323
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:40,393
这位是萝斯.
This is Rose.

324
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:41,896
-嗨，萝斯。-嗨，萝斯。
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Rose.

325
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:43,933
欢迎来到天堂，下士。
Welcome to paradise, Corporal.

326
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,763
谢谢，下士。
Thank you, Corporal.

327
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,023
-致四蜂组合！-还有他们的女士们。
- To the Four Bees!
- And their ladies.

328
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:13,323
还有他们的姑娘们。
And their girls.

329
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,330
-永远忠诚。-永远忠诚！
- Semper fi.
- Semper fi!

330
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:19,801
这里只有三个B啊，贝尔津，本杰明，博雷斯。
That's only three B's.
Berzin, Benjamin, and Birdlace.

331
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:22,934
我的名字叫比尔。他们只是叫我奥基而已。
My name's Buell. They just call me Okie.

332
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:24,940
你们都是在新兵训练营里成为朋友的吗？
You've all been friends since boot camp?

333
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:28,637
不，在训练营里，都是按身高排列的。
No. In boot camp, you line up by height.

334
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:33,649
在步兵训练营里，在新兵训练营后的步兵训练，是按照字母排序的。
In ITR, infantry training after boot camp,
it's alphabetical order.

335
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,843
于是我们都被排在一起了。
So we always lined up together.

336
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,352
然后关系就非常好了。
Got to be pretty tight.

337
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:40,085
大家之后就开始叫我们四蜂组合。
Everyone started calling us the Four Bees.

338
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:43,057
然后我们从那以后就黏在一块了。
And we've stuck together since then.

339
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,854
那么说，你们排对排一起就得成为朋友了？
So, you got to be friends
from standing in line?

340
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:56,428
呃，很高兴见到你们，真的。
Well, I'm happy to meet you all. I really am.

341
00:23:56,506 --> 00:23:58,440
他妈的我们的酒水呢？
Where's our fucking drinks?

342
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,602
-你们挺喜欢说粗口的嘛。-不，我们喜欢喝酒。
- You guys like to swear.
- No. We like to drink.

343
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:06,210
这不是什么大不了的，萝斯，只是单词而已。过了一会，你就习以为常了。
No big thing, Rose. It's just words.
After a while, you don't even hear it.

344
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:07,647
P都不算。
Don't mean shit.

345
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:11,050
-空点位置出来。-我已经喝了两瓶了。
- Make room for another round.
- I've already had two.

346
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,850
亲爱的，别担心。
Honey, don't worry about it.

347
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,618
这只是迈泰（加勒比香槟），酒精度数很低的。
It's just a mai tai. Very weak drink.

348
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,191
相信我，你不会喝醉的。
Trust me. You won't get drunk.

349
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,195
好吧，喝光吧，我再叫两瓶。
Right. Drink up. I'll take another double.

350
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:21,787
大家都进舞池来！
Everyone on the dance floor!

351
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:22,957
谢谢。
Thanks.

352
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:25,431
先生们，我说我们该跳舞了。
Gentlemen, I say we dance.

353
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:26,730
好的。
Right.

354
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,730
想跳支舞吗？两只熊小姐？
Care to dance, Miss Two Bears?

355
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:31,103
来吧，亲爱的，让我们动起来。
Come on, darling. Let's hit it.

356
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,472
让我们掀起一阵暴风雨吧。
Let's see if we can make a rainstorm.

357
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:35,807
让他们见识见识我们的厉害。
Let's show them what we got.

358
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:39,945
-你生我的气了吗？-没有。
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

359
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:44,581
-呃，你明显生气了。-我比一只双相的猫头鹰还开心。
- Well, you sure seem mad.
- I'm happier than a two-peckered owl.

360
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:46,178
就是那个该死的女服务生。
It's the fucking waitress.

361
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:48,381
来吧，埃迪，我们跳舞去吧。
Come on, Eddie. Let's dance.

362
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,950
我们马上就去，她要先把她的酒喝完。
We'll be there in a minute.
She has to finish her drink still.

363
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:55,696
来吧，甜心，挪动你的屁股跳舞吧。
Come on, honey.
Get off your ass and dance.

364
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,163
还有严格的比赛正在进行呢。
Got some tough competition out there.

365
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:22,522
-玩得开心吗？博雷斯？-啊，是啊，继续啊，混蛋。
- Having a good time, Corporal Birdlegs?
- Yeah, yeah. Carry on, asshole.

366
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,420
-博雷斯？-只是个外号。
- Birdlegs?
- It's just a nickname.

367
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,922
-服务生！-别再喝了。
- Waitress!
- Don't drink any more.

368
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,224
跟我说说话。
Talk to me.

369
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,928
这是哪个种类的鸟？
What kind of a bird is that?

370
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:36,935
一只知更鸟。快乐的知更鸟。
A bluebird, the bluebird of happiness.

371
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:39,975
看见没?它会飞。把我带离所有的烦恼...
See? It flies.
It carries me from all the troubles...

372
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:42,068
...把我带去充满欢乐的地方.
...and takes me to where it's all happy.

373
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:44,669
真是狗扯蛋的.
Crock of shit.

374
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:47,443
成真过吗?
Does it ever work?

375
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:51,347
我们离开这吧.
Let's get out of here.

376
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:53,286
我还以为我们要去跳舞的.
I thought we were supposed to dance.

377
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:56,291
你是个很好的姑娘,这地方烂透了.
You're a nice girl. This is a fucked-up place.

378
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,691
我想跳舞,来吧.
I'd like to dance. Come on.

379
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,661
让我们动起来,博雷斯.
Let's hit it, Birdlegs.

380
00:26:01,764 --> 00:26:03,857
好吧,保持忠诚,要么做,要么死.
Yeah. Semper fi, do or die.

381
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:51,944
你给她几分?
What do you give her?

382
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,513
-4分.-4分.
- Four.
- Four?

383
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,177
她都不是个女的，看在上帝的份上。
She's not even a woman, for Christ's sake.

384
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:00,517
放屁。
Bullshit.

385
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,322
她是个她妈的异装癖。
She's a fucking guy in drag.

386
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:06,191
你怎么能给她4分？
How can you give her a four?

387
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,060
狗日的，还真是个男的。
Son of a bitch, that is a guy.

388
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,561
那我要给他7分、
I'll give him a seven.

389
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:20,541
-你玩的开心不？-是啊。
- You having a good time?
- Yes.

390
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:35,854
看看我们有什么好货？
What have we here?

391
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:39,260
噢，我的天啊。
Oh, my god.

392
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:43,966
真他妈狗日的。
That son of a bitch.

393
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:47,892
她很给力。
She's nice.

394
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,564
先生们，我想我们已经有个胜者了。
Gentlemen, I think we got a winner here.

395
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:53,538
贝尔津赢了，大贝尔津。
Berzin wins. Big Berzin.

396
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:54,735
胜者！
Winner!

397
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:56,244
-10分！10分。
- Ten.
- Ten.

398
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:05,220
-怎么了？-没什么。
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

399
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:16,763
老天。
Jesus.

400
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,495
-给那个几分？-荣誉奖吧。
- How many points for that?
- Honorable mention.

401
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:23,471
胜者来咯！
Here's the man!

402
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:24,900
奖金呢？
Where's the money?

403
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:25,998
不可思议。
Unbelievable.

404
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:29,610
不可思议啊，老兄，你他妈在哪找到她的？
Unbelievable, man.
Where the fuck did you find her?

405
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,340
那可是他妈的顶级机密。
That's top-fucking-secret.

406
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:34,815
恭喜你，你个烂人，老天啊，她简直丑成一逼了。
Congratulations, you piece of shit.
God, was she butt-ugly.

407
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,079
赢得当之无愧啊，连续四次稳赢!
A well-deserved win. That's four in a row.

408
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:40,987
她妈的整个陆战队还没人连着四次赢的.
Nobody in the entire fucking Marine Corps
ever won four in a row.

409
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,855
我得说我可是个幸运的家伙.
I'd say I'm one lucky motherfucker.

410
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,188
我也觉得你是个幸运的家伙.
I think you're one lucky motherfucker.

411
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:51,961
-别灰心啊,本杰明.-去你妈的.
- No hard feelings, Benjamin.
- Eat my ass.

412
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,126
也去你妈的.
Fuck you, too.

413
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:55,932
噢,天啊.
Oh, boy.

414
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:11,047
-才给50块? -饶了我吧.
-Only $50?
- Cut me some slack, will you?

415
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,213
饶了你?你在字典里找到这个词的?
Slack? You find '"slack'" in the dictionary.

416
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,450
在狗屎和梅毒之间.
Between '"shit'" and '"syphilis.'"

417
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:17,493
那打的费呢!我付了8块钱打的费诶.
Cab fare. I paid $8 for that cab.

418
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,960
贝尔津,我告诉你你可不是在和牧师谈话.
Berzin, this ain't the chaplain
you're talking to.

419
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:23,829
你来找我帮忙,我帮了,但是要五五分成,我们说好的.
You come to me for help. I help,
for half the money. That was the deal.

420
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,460
别她妈跟我说什么打的费.
Don't give me shit about a fucking cab.

421
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:30,233
我她妈才懒得鸟你,你个该死的婊子.麻痹给你就给你.
I'm not giving you shit, you goddamn slut.
Take your goddamn money.

422
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:32,467
你个草比的混蛋!老天啊...
You fucking asshole! God...

423
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:37,039
操他妈的锅盖头.你们全都是混蛋.
Fucking jarheads. You're all assholes.

424
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:46,781
怎么了,玛西?
What's wrong, Marcie?

425
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:49,654
那男的是个混蛋.
The man's an asshole. That's what's wrong.

426
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,260
他说,"嘿,牙龈妹,想不想赚50块...
He says, '"Hey, Gums, how'd you like
to make $50...

427
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:56,787
而且你不用跟任何人上床,我就说,那前提是什么?
'"...and you don't have to do nobody? '"
I say, '"What's the catch? '"

428
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:59,733
他说没前提.然后告诉我这个斗狗比赛.
'"No catch.'" So he tells me
about this dogfight thing.

429
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:01,167
于是我就说,行.
So I say, '"Sure.'"

430
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:03,671
我甚至连假牙都没戴.
I even offer not to wear my teeth.

431
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:07,299
不好意思,我不明白.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

432
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:11,371
要死,算了.
Shit. Never mind.

433
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:21,990
不,我想听听.
No. I'd like to hear.

434
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,492
其实也还好,不是么?
It's not really as bad as it sounds, all right?

435
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:28,325
免费鸡尾酒,免费啤酒...
Free cocktail, free beer...

436
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:30,456
...然后他们会很礼貌.
...and they got to be polite.

437
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,763
那些就是规矩.他们必需得礼貌.
Those are the rules. They got to be polite.

438
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:35,599
-什么规矩?-斗狗赛的规矩.
- What rules?
- The rules of the dogfight.

439
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:40,537
你看,他们每个人都压点钱,50块啊,70块或75块等等...
See, they each put in some money,
like $50, $70, $75...

440
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,702
谁?
Who does?

441
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:44,245
那些混蛋,陆战队员.
The assholes, the Marines.

442
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,380
然后此外他们还要租下这个这方,买吃的和喝的...
And out of that they rent the joint,
pay for the food and the booze...

443
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,942
...剩下的钱就作为奖金.
...and the rest of the money
goes to prize money.

444
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,922
最让我气愤的是他们还以为他们自己长得多好看.
The thing that gets me is how great
they think they look.

445
00:30:55,858 --> 00:30:58,554
你有见过一帮这么傻逼的人么?
You ever seen such a pack of pukes?

446
00:30:58,628 --> 00:30:59,788
还有奖金的?
There's prize money?

447
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:02,888
对,哪个男的带的女的最丑...
That's right.
The ugliest woman wins $100...

448
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:05,058
...就能赢得100块.
...for the guy who brings her.

449
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:07,793
我是最丑的,所以赢了.
I'm the ugliest, so I win.

450
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:10,600
但是,知道么...
Only, see...

451
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:14,902
...我也没那么丑.你应该看看我装扮过后的样子.
...I ain't really that ugly. You should
see me when I'm really dressed up.

452
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,808
噢，上帝啊，太糟糕了。
Oh, God. This is awful.

453
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:19,376
玛西，你肯定觉得很难过。
Marcie, you must feel terrible.

454
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:21,606
也没那么难过。
It's not so bad.

455
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:23,345
至少我赚了50块。
At least I got $50.

456
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,216
你除了呕吐啥都没得到。
All you got was sick.

457
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:29,949
嘿！
Hey!

458
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:33,226
-玩得如何啊，屎鸟？-很好。
- How you doing there, Shitbird?
- Good.

459
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:35,491
你刚赢了荣誉奖。
You just won honorable mention.

460
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:38,056
有26块奖金可拿。
That's $26 in prize money.

461
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:42,099
幸好她吐了，否则我们就要给非科特了。
It's a good thing she puked up
or we'd have to give it to Fector.

462
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:45,800
可比一把刺刀顶着你屁股好多了。
Hell of a lot better than a bayonet
up your ass.

463
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,739
向来都是。
Always.

464
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:49,668
喂！
Hey!

465
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:51,645
你少装正经。
Don't you dare '"hey'" me.

466
00:31:51,714 --> 00:31:54,239
你就是个残忍的，没良心的，无知的怪胎。
You are a cruel, heartless, ignorant creep.

467
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:57,047
要是我是个男人，我非把你扁成肉酱不可。
If I were a man, I'd beat you to a pulp.

468
00:31:58,254 --> 00:32:00,882
谁给你的权利去这么对待别人？
Who gave you the right
to treat people like this?

469
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:02,288
这简直恶毒！
It's vicious!

470
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:04,155
你们都是恶毒的人！
All of you are just vicious!

471
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:05,716
对不起！
I'm sorry!

472
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:07,990
你还对不起？你根本没有感情。
How can you be sorry?
You have no feelings.

473
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:11,192
你只是个毫无价值的人渣。
You're just a worthless excuse
for a human being.

474
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,861
-喂，他是我的船友诶！-闭嘴，你个变态！
- Hey, that's my shipmate!
- Shut up, you creep!

475
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:16,137
你的道歉对我来说什么都不是。
Your apology means nothing to me.

476
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:19,140
每个从你嘴巴里吐出来的字都是腐烂的肮脏的谎言。
Everything out of your mouth
has been rotten, dirty lies.

477
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,470
我真后悔碰到你。
I'm sorry I ever met you.

478
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:23,238
好吧。
Okay.

479
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,947
天啊，真是个贱人。
God, what a bitch.

480
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:28,382
你在哪找到她的？
Where did you find her?

481
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:29,577
混球！
Jerk!

482
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,378
看在上帝的份上。
For Christ's sakes.

483
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:33,115
这都搞什么呀？
What the hell was that about?

484
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:36,454
老天！你们得好好控制你的女人。
Jesus Christ!
You should be able to control your woman.

485
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:56,303
萝斯。
Rose.

486
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:00,304
恩？
What?

487
00:33:00,383 --> 00:33:02,908
现在才八点半，什么派对啊，那么早结束的？
It's 8:30. What kind of party ends so early?

488
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:05,279
我想早点回家来。
I decided to come home early.

489
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,552
你玩得开心不？
You have a good time?

490
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:12,325
是啊，还不错，我去练吉他了，
Yeah. It was nice.
I'm going to go practice my guitar.

491
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,124
别太响，好吗？
Not too loud, okay?

492
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,711
Repent!

493
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,573
喂，走路看着点。
Hey, watch your step.

494
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,810
Repent!

495
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,681
滚开。
Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.

496
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,553
成人动画！
Cartoons for adults!

497
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,529
我爱胜利的感觉，下士！感觉真他妈好。
I love winning, Corporal!
It feels so fucking good.

498
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:50,531
来，我给你拿了瓶啤酒。
Here. I got you a beer.

499
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,302
别他妈老盯着我。
Quit eye-fucking me.

500
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:01,400
上帝！
Jesus!

501
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:04,207
这玩意儿还他妈要计时的。
They got these fucking things timed.

502
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,110
先是她刚要脱奶罩的时候就停。
First it stops just when
she takes off her bra.

503
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:09,481
现在又在她要脱内裤的时候停。
Now it stops just as she
takes off her panties.

504
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:11,281
气死老子了。
That pisses me off.

505
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:13,150
来，我们戴上帽子。
Let's put on our hat.

506
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:15,481
用肚子顶着那皮套。
Belly up to that holster.

507
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:18,216
你看起来就像老爸的牛仔小姑娘。
You look like Daddy's little cowgirl.

508
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:21,094
现在，要记住最重要的是....
Now, what's the most important thing
to remember...

509
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:22,562
...在一场野蛮的西部枪战中.
...during a Wild West shootout?

510
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:23,723
杀,杀,杀.
Kill, kill, kill.

511
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:27,257
很好,找到适当的位置.列好队.
Right. Get in position.
Line that son of a bitch up.

512
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:29,133
-开始！-杀！杀！杀！
- Draw!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

513
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:33,674
你在干什么？打扰一下，女士，我得跟他说两句。
What are you doing?
Excuse me, ma'am. I got to talk to him.

514
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:36,842
-怎么了？-斗狗赛结束了。
- What's going on?
- The dogfight's over.

515
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:39,943
好啊，现在慢慢脱下短裤。
Okay, now half-mast those skivvies.

516
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,441
贱人！操你大爷的机器！
Bitch! Fucking machine!

517
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,246
干嘛，你才刚学会走路？
What, you just learn to walk?

518
00:34:46,288 --> 00:34:48,085
奥基，再给我个硬币。
Okie, give me another nickel.

519
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,125
-可以，但是我也要看。-好啊。
- All right, but I get to see, too.
- Okay.

520
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:52,057
-我是说真的。-我也是说真的，给我。
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious. Give it to me.

521
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,755
博雷斯去哪了？
Where did Birdlace go?

522
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:56,161
他闪人了，说会去Navy Bill's跟我们会合。
He took off,he said he'd meet us at Navy Bill's.

523
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:59,360
要是我再看不到她的屁股，我就要来干你了。
If I don't see her ass soon,
I'm going to hump you.

524
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:53,911
有狗！
Dog!

525
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:09,604
萝斯，怎么回事？谁在外面？
Rosie, what is it? Who's out there?

526
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:12,072
没什么，就船长（狗名）在叫呢。
It's all right. It's just Captain.

527
00:36:48,077 --> 00:36:49,101
过来。
Here.

528
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:50,975
来呀。
Come on.

529
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,636
来呀，到这来。
Come on. Here.

530
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:57,479
乖孩子，你个了不起的狗崽子。
Good boy. Yeah.
You're a big fucker, aren't you?

531
00:36:57,686 --> 00:37:00,553
哦？还想要？看看你那对耳朵。
Yeah? Want some? Look at those ears.

532
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:25,847
好了，淡定。
Okay, easy.

533
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:03,151
狗娘养的！
Motherfucker!

534
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,668
你想干嘛？
What do you want?

535
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,444
挺漂亮的花么。
Pretty hokey, isn't it?

536
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,448
对不起，我觉得你会喜欢。
Sorry. I thought you'd like it.

537
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:14,917
我有赢得什么吗？
Did I win anything?

538
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:16,652
什么都没。
Nothing.

539
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:18,957
你还不够资格。
You were disqualified.

540
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,528
-骗人。-萝斯，我发誓。
- Liar.
- Rose, I swear.

541
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,658
那别的姑娘呢？
What about those other girls?

542
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:27,326
她们怎么？
What about them?

543
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:31,134
她们的感受呢？你真的以为她们没感受吗？
What about their feelings? Do you honestly
think they have no feelings?

544
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:34,835
她们对此一无所知，再说，你不一样。
They didn't know anything about it.
Besides, you're different.

545
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,311
我参加过6次斗狗。
I've been to six different dogfights.

546
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:39,939
你是第一个姑娘我尝试着劝她别去的。
You're the first girl I ever tried to talk
out of going.

547
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:43,576
-才没有。-真的，你不记得了吗？
- You did not.
- Yes, ma'am. You don't remember?

548
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:46,052
在夜光俱乐部门前，我试着阻止过你。
In front of the Nitelite? I tried to stop you.

549
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:50,080
还有跳舞前也阻止过。当你跳舞的时候，就是最终裁决。
And before dancing, too.
When you dance, that's final judging.

550
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,952
真是疯狂，我真不理解你，
That's crazy. I don't understand you.

551
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:57,426
有很多操蛋的东西我也不明白。
There's a lot of shit I don't understand.

552
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,592
我从来都不道歉的。
I don't apologize, ever.

553
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:02,796
但是我却大老远跑回来跟你道歉，
And I came all the fuck way back here
to apologize.

554
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,964
我真的也不明白。
And I don't understand that.

555
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,199
我想带你去吃晚饭...
I wanted to take you out to dinner...

556
00:40:08,277 --> 00:40:10,905
...尽量补偿你,要是可能话...
...and try to make things up to you
if possible...

557
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:13,709
...现在我站在这里感觉就像个他妈的白痴.
...and I'm standing here now
feeling like an idiot.

558
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:15,272
所以,管他妈的.
So, fuck it.

559
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:19,550
如果你不想我在这,如果你真的很讨厌我...
If you don't want me around
and I'm a pain in your ass...

560
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:21,350
...尽管叫我离开,我马上就走.
...just tell me to leave, and I'm gone.

561
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:25,518
我想你停止说脏话.
I want you to stop swearing.

562
00:40:26,228 --> 00:40:27,286
可以.
Okay.

563
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:32,525
那好吧.
Okay.

564
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:35,532
-什么那好吧?-那好吧,我们去吃晚饭.
- Okay what?
- Okay, let's go to dinner.

565
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:38,637
但是如果这也是你们斗狗赛的一部分,我就杀了你.
But if this is part of your dogfight,
I'll kill you.

566
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,766
不,萝斯,这不是.
No, Rose, it's not.

567
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:45,780
我保证.这只是你和我一块去一个不错的地方吃顿不错的饭.
I promise. It's just you and I
at a nice joint having a nice dinner.

568
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:48,316
我们甚至都不会再提起这个斗狗赛.
We won't ever mention this dogfight again.

569
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:49,748
遵命.
Roger that.

570
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:54,388
这将只是一个寻常的约会,就两个普通人进行一个普通的约会.
It'll just be like a regular date,
just two regular people on a regular date.

571
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:55,480
对.
Right.

572
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:08,264
你知道博雷斯这人的,他可能现在就在外面行动呢.
Well, knowing Birdlace,
he's probably out looking for action.

573
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:09,861
说到行动...
Speaking of action...

574
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,238
你能相信吗?
Can you believe it?

575
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,906
两个美女居然给一群甲板猿泡了!
Two beautiful women lost
to a detachment of deck apes!

576
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:25,281
-哟,我还以为我闻到乌贼屎了呢.-我也闻到了.
- Well, I thought I smelled squid shit.
- I smell it.

577
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:29,421
你们是不是想吃我的屎?
How'd you like to eat my shit?

578
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:31,288
操你妈的锅盖头.
Fucking jarhead.

579
00:41:32,694 --> 00:41:34,321
打!打!
Fight! Fight!

580
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:40,401
Market and Powell站到了.

581
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,767
-我们在这下车?-对.
- Do we get off here?
- Yeah.

582
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,075
我知道一处地方.
I think I know a place.

583
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,582
这里.
Here.

584
00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:15,500
我们还能找家更好的.
We can do better.

585
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:18,972
-埃迪,这个餐馆不错啊.-我们还能找家更好的.
- Eddie, this is a nice restaurant.
- We can do better.

586
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:36,787
-你好,需要什么帮助吗?-恩,打扰一下,两人餐.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Excuse me. Dinner for two.

587
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:40,191
-您有预约吗?-恩,我的秘书打来过,叫基尔默.
- Do you have a reservation?
- Yes, my secretary called in. Gilmore.

588
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:44,456
那个也不重要啊,那里不是还有很多位置嘛.
Not that that should matter,
being there's plenty of room.

589
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:47,696
是的,可是除非你穿一件夹克衫...
Yes, sir, there is,
but unless you have a jacket...

590
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,031
...否则我就无法让您入座.
...I can't seat you.

591
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:50,469
我就穿着夹克啊.
I'm wearing a jacket.

592
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:52,473
您穿的是件风衣,先生.
You're wearing a windbreaker, sir.

593
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:56,841
我指的是正式用餐穿的夹克,或者至少要一条领带或与运动外套.
I was speaking of a dinner jacket
or at least a tie and sports coat.

594
00:42:57,145 --> 00:43:00,046
你就不能让我们坐在后面吗,远离通道?
Couldn't you just put us in the back,
out of the way?

595
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:02,276
这是我在美国的最后一个晚上了...
It's my last night stateside...

596
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:06,219
...我想带我女朋友吃顿晚餐.
...and I wanted to take my girl
out to dinner.

597
00:43:06,288 --> 00:43:09,416
对不起,先生,我们这里有严格的条例.
I'm sorry, sir,
but it's a rule strictly enforced.

598
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:13,485
好吧,谢谢.
Well, thank you.

599
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,427
-那男的是个混球!-他只是在做他的工作而已.
- That man's a prick!
- He was doing his job.

600
00:43:20,502 --> 00:43:23,266
放屁!就像个二级中尉,给他们点权利...
Bullshit! Just like a 2nd lieutenant,
give them some power...

601
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:24,965
...他们就跟狗吃屎一样都涌过来.
...they roll in it like dogs in shit.

602
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,635
让他们感觉像变成了狼一样,实际上还不是一只狗.
Makes them feel like wolves
instead of the little lap dog that he is.

603
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,337
我非整死他.
I'm going to burn his ass.

604
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:34,548
埃迪,怎么回事啊?
Eddie, what is the problem?

605
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:37,483
我们应该好好吃顿饭,开开心心约会的.
We were supposed to have
a nice, normal date.

606
00:43:37,552 --> 00:43:40,487
没什么,我只是肩负任务而已.
There's no problem.
Just a man with a mission.

607
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:41,988
什么任务?
What kind of mission?

608
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,060
你和我一起对抗混球.
You and me against the pricks.

609
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:48,721
听懂了吗?
Are you with me?

610
00:43:49,264 --> 00:43:51,562
今晚简直太疯狂了.
It has just been the craziest night.

611
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:55,364
埃迪的祖父去世了,我们得赶着去做午夜弥撒.
ddie's grandfather dies,
and we're headed for midnight mass.

612
00:43:55,437 --> 00:43:57,098
把那件放回去.
Put that back where it belongs.

613
00:43:57,172 --> 00:44:00,699
埃迪的衣柜里没有适合的参加葬礼的衣服.
Eddie just doesn't have appropriate
funeral wear hanging in his closet.

614
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:03,244
我理解.可是现在都那么晚了,我们刚还在睡觉呢.
I understand. But it's late. We were asleep.

615
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:05,439
我知道,我很抱歉,只是...
I know, I'm very sorry, it's just...

616
00:44:05,514 --> 00:44:08,449
我们只要一件夹克就行了,这样埃迪能以最好的姿态前往.
We'd just like one jacket
so Eddie can look his best.

617
00:44:08,517 --> 00:44:10,417
-亲爱的,快点.-好的,亲爱的.
- Please, darling, hurry.
- Okay, darling.

618
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:12,476
我尽快.
I'm hurrying as fast as possible.

619
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:16,352
埃迪选不好了,他有点震惊.
Eddie's having trouble making decisions.
He's shook up.

620
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:17,983
怎么回事啊?
What the hell's going on?

621
00:44:18,827 --> 00:44:20,852
他们要去参加一个葬礼.
They're going to a funeral.

622
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:26,092
萝斯,你刚才的那些胡扯简直棒极了.让我印象深刻啊.
Rose, that was outstanding bullshit.
I was really impressed.

623
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:29,433
你在那乱扔衣服还真不容易.
It wasn't easy with you
throwing jackets all over.

624
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:38,369
晚上好,双人晚餐.
Good evening. Dinner for two, please.

625
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,954
谢谢.
Thanks.

626
00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:56,323
看啊.真好真干净啊!
Look. It's so nice, so clean!

627
00:45:03,038 --> 00:45:04,938
萝斯,你觉得坐这里怎样?
Rose, what do you think of this one?

628
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:08,339
嘿,朋友,这边,这边正好,谢谢.
Hey, friendly. Over here.
This will be just fine, thanks.

629
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:14,175
请坐.
Please.

630
00:45:14,983 --> 00:45:16,678
这是我的荣幸.
It's my pleasure.

631
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,946
非常感谢.
Thank you so much.

632
00:45:19,254 --> 00:45:21,722
你太好了,这是给你的小费,一块钱.
You've been so wonderful.
This is for you. $1.

633
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,054
-不必要吧.-我坚持请您收下.
- That won't be necessary.
- Please, I insist!

634
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:26,321
你就值一块钱.不是吗?
You're worth $1. Isn't he?

635
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:28,830
看见没?你就是值一块钱.
See? You are worth $1.

636
00:45:29,297 --> 00:45:31,595
谢谢你的一切时间和努力.
Thank you so much for your time and effort.

637
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:43,742
等着吧我跟他还没完呢,他不会知道还有什么好戏要上演.
Just wait till I'm through with him.
He won't know whether to shit or go blind.

638
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:46,610
你已经开心了啊,为什么还要这么做.
You've had your fun.
Why do you have to do this?

639
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:51,909
别人打我一拳,我还他十拳.
Someone dumps on me five pounds,
I dump back fifty.

640
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,983
我跟那个混球还没完.
I'm not through with that jack-off, yet.

641
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:57,548
要是你要浪费今天一晚上让他不好过...
If you spend the night
making him miserable...

642
00:45:57,626 --> 00:45:58,923
...那我就回家了.
...I am going home.

643
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:00,655
-啥?-我是说真的.
- What?
- I'm serious.

644
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:02,788
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

645
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:06,595
我们来这是想好好吃顿饭的,我必须从他地方得到点尊重.
We came here to have a nice dinner.
And I'd like some respect from him.

646
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:08,363
你也应该得到点尊重.
You deserve respect, too.

647
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,962
而且我们也像别人一样是付了钱的.
We're paying just like everyone else.

648
00:46:11,206 --> 00:46:12,673
你就靠这个来获取尊重?
That's how you get respect?

649
00:46:16,378 --> 00:46:18,744
人都他妈的那么白痴.
People are such goddamn idiots.

650
00:46:18,814 --> 00:46:20,145
我知道他么是.
I know they are.

651
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:24,743
可是为什么要花费你所有的力气去跟每个人较劲呢?
But what's the point of spending all your
energy trying to get even with everybody?

652
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:28,145
因为这感觉很好.这感觉他妈的好极了,特别是...
Because it feels great.
It feels fucking great, especially...

653
00:46:28,223 --> 00:46:32,319
而且为什么每个从你嘴巴里说出来的字都是脏话?
And what's the point of every word
out of your mouth being a curse word?

654
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:35,786
你们准备好点菜了吗?
Are you ready to order now?

655
00:46:35,864 --> 00:46:37,456
是的,该死的.
Yes, goddamn it.

656
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:41,563
我要来一份他妈的水煮鱼...
I'm going to have
the fucking poached salmon...

657
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,561
...配上狗娘养的米饭...
...with the son-of-a-bitching rice...

658
00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:48,375
...再来一份操大爷的沙拉...
...and a dirty-bastard salad...

659
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:51,503
...配上屎一般的羊乳干酪酱.
...with a shitload of Roquefort dressing.

660
00:46:52,414 --> 00:46:53,745
谢谢.
Thank you.

661
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:56,609
还有不知道这位混蛋想吃什么.
And who knows what this asshole wants.

662
00:46:59,721 --> 00:47:01,916
我就来瓶狗日的啤酒好了.
I'll just take a fucking beer.

663
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:04,689
谢谢.
Thank you.

664
00:47:12,868 --> 00:47:15,428
-你就点一瓶啤酒?-是啊.
- That's all you're going to have, a beer?
- Yeah.

665
00:47:15,504 --> 00:47:16,903
你肯定饿坏了.
You must be starved.

666
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,002
没,我不饿.
No, I'm not starved.

667
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:25,912
-这是您点的菜.-谢谢.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

668
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:27,949
我就把它放在这里.
I'll just put this over here for now.

669
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:30,211
水煮鱼和抓饭.
Poached salmon and rice pilaf.

670
00:47:34,055 --> 00:47:36,148
看起来真美味啊.你觉得呢?
It's beautiful. Isn't this beautiful?

671
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:38,556
是啊,看起来很好吃,相当好吃.
Yeah. That looks good, real good.

672
00:47:39,494 --> 00:47:41,257
看吧,你的确饿了.
See, you are hungry.

673
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:44,992
你为什么不点些东西呢?
Why didn't you order anything?

674
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48,466
我付不起.
I couldn't pay for it.

675
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:52,335
我是说我能付得起那个，和这瓶酒，不过到发薪日钱只能付得起这些。
I mean I can pay for that, and for this,
but that's all till payday.

676
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,812
你这是干什么？
What's that for?

677
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:09,383
你干嘛？
What are you doing?

678
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:19,093
谢了。
Thanks.

679
00:48:24,906 --> 00:48:26,203
我去结账。
I'm going to hit the head.

680
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:28,174
好的，我在外面等你。
Okay I'll wait outside.

681
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,850
我知道他刚才对你很无礼。
I know that he was so rude to you.

682
00:48:39,321 --> 00:48:42,381
但是我觉得靠外表和穿着...
But I don't think it's fair
to prejudge people...

683
00:48:42,457 --> 00:48:44,857
...去预先判断别人是不公平的.
...on how they look or how they're dressed.

684
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:46,518
你觉得呢?
Don't you think?

685
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,301
谢谢你.
Thank you.

686
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,718
你在笑嘻嘻的在笑什么?
So, what are you grinning about?

687
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:16,820
我在想你头发长一点,少了脸上那块淤青...I was wondering what you'd look like
with your hair a little longer, and without...

688
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,627
...会是怎么样.
...that bruise on your face.

689
00:49:20,295 --> 00:49:22,923
呃,不会好看很多,那是肯定的.
Well, not much better. That's for sure.

690
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:25,158
我们有句话是这么说的:
We've got a saying:

691
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:28,202
...比上不足,比下有余...那说的就是我.
'"Shot at and missed. Shit at and hit.'"
That's me.

692
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:36,367
那么,很快我就该送你回家了.
So, I should take you home soon.

693
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:39,638
对不?已经有点晚了.
Right? It's kind of late.

694
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:41,448
我不知道.
I don't know.

695
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:47,119
我想去散散步,你想散步吗?
I feel like walking. You feel like walking?

696
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:48,681
当然.
Sure.

697
00:49:53,962 --> 00:49:55,122
谢谢你请我吃饭.
Thanks for dinner.

698
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:57,991
-你太客气了.-刚才真的很愉快.
- You're so welcome.
- It was really nice.

699
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,501
这可能是我吃过最贵的一顿了.
It's probably the most expensive meal
I ever had.

700
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:26,522
我们不得不迁移到密苏里.
We had to relocate to Missouri.

701
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:29,392
刚赶到那,我就试着加入空军...
Soon as I got there,
I tried to join the Air Force...

702
00:50:29,464 --> 00:50:31,489
...可是他们的招聘人员出去吃午饭了.
...but their recruiter was out to lunch.

703
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:35,662
陆战队的招聘组看到我在邮局那走就说:
The Marine Corps recruiter sees me
pacing there in the post office and says:

704
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:38,706
...埃莉诺罗斯福谈起过你...
'"Eleanor Roosevelt was talking about you.'"

705
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,070
埃莉诺罗斯福?
Eleanor Roosevelt?

706
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:44,202
是啊,于是我说,开什么国际玩笑,她都死了.
Yeah. So I say, '"That's quite a trick,
seeing as she's dead.'"

707
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:46,270
他说,"这是她死前说的.
He says, '"She said it before she died.

708
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:51,284
她称你为一个性欲过剩,训练过度,营养不良,工资过少的杀人机器.
'"She called you an oversexed, overtrained,
underfed, underpaid killing machine.'"

709
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:54,779
我还以为他疯了,于是我就问他,我说:
I thought he was crazy.
So I asked him, I said:

710
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:56,790
你他妈在说什么东西?
'"What the hell are you talking about? '"

711
00:50:56,858 --> 00:51:00,487
他说:她当时在讲的是陆战队员.
He says, '"She was talking about Marines.

712
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:03,762
...而对我来说你看起来就像个陆战队员.
'"And you sure as hell
look like a Marine to me.'"

713
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:05,966
我觉得那还是挺利落的.
I thought that was pretty neat.

714
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:09,595
于是我狂奔回家,找到老爸,带他回来...
So I bolted home, got the old man,
brought him back...

715
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:13,300
...然后他飞一般的签下那些文书,差点扭了他的手腕.
...and he signed those papers so damn fast
he nearly sprained his wrist.

716
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:19,842
我那时还是个小混蛋,不过我只有16岁.
I was a little shit back then,
but I was only 16.

717
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,745
我不觉得你是个小混蛋.
I don't think you're a little shit.

718
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:23,078
哎呀,谢谢.
Gee, thanks.

719
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,182
-好咯.-美极了.
- There you go.
- It's a beauty.

720
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:32,289
太他妈棒了.
Out-fucking-standing.

721
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:35,054
真的,太他妈棒了!
I mean, out-fucking-standing!

722
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,222
起来，下一个我来，
Get up. Me next.

723
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:40,832
好，记住了...
Okay, and remember...

724
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:43,894
...在完全一样的地方给他纹个完全一样的蜜蜂.
...exact same bee
on the exact same spot for him.

725
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:45,228
知道了.
Gotcha.

726
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,338
还有,急着呆会还有个叫博雷斯的来.
And remember, there's another one
of us coming. Birdlace.

727
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,809
他现在还没到,不过也给他纹一样的.
He ain't here yet,
but exact same thing for him.

728
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:53,040
一样的地方,一样的蜜蜂.
Same spot and same bee.

729
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:54,479
行,行.
Yeah. Yeah.

730
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,546
因为我们有四个人.
'Cause there's four of us.

731
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:57,949
四蜂团队.
Four Bees.

732
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:01,881
博雷斯,贝尔津.
There's Birdlace and Berzin.

733
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:03,719
我叫比尔.
My name's Buell.

734
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:07,421
该死的,奥基!少烦他，看在上帝的份上。
Goddamn it, Okie! Leave the fucking guy
alone, for Christ's sakes.

735
00:52:07,896 --> 00:52:09,386
他是本杰明。
He's Benjamin.

736
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:17,463
埃迪，我还会再见到你吗？
Eddie, will I get to see you some more?

737
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,731
我不知道，你想吗？
I don't know. You want to?

738
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,034
想。
Yeah.

739
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:26,544
好啊，等我回来我就来带你出去玩。
Okay, then I'll take you out
as soon as I get back.

740
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:28,248
从哪回来？
Get back from where?

741
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:31,046
我明天一早就要出海。
Well, I'm shipping out
first thing tomorrow morning.

742
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,381
出国去。
Going overseas.

743
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:35,185
-去哪？-冲绳岛。
- Where are you going?
- Okinawa.

744
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,651
不过我瞄准的是另一个地方。
But I'm aiming for this other place.

745
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:40,421
印度边上的一个小国家，叫越南。
It's a little country near India
called Vietnam.

746
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:43,255
我读到过这个。
I read about it.

747
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:46,696
-他们那边是不是在打仗？-不，不是。
- Aren't they fighting there or something?
- No, not really.

748
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:51,501
我们去那边只是作为顾问什么的，教他们如何应付党员。
We'll just be there as advisers
to teach them how to handle the Commies.

749
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,339
那很危险的啊。
That could be dangerous.

750
00:52:53,408 --> 00:52:54,340
不会。
No.

751
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:56,343
打打小仗而已。
Kick a little ass, take a few names.

752
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:58,606
几个月后就能回来。
Be back in a couple of months.

753
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,574
你之前怎么不告诉我你明天要离开。
Why didn't you tell me before
that you were leaving?

754
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,709
我认为这听起来像胡扯。
I thought it would sound like bullshit.

755
00:53:04,786 --> 00:53:09,223
你懂的，那种为了跟你上床才说的。
You know, something just to say
to get into your skivvies.

756
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:16,928
-你介意我写信给你吗？-给我？当然不介意了，那简直太好了。
- Would you mind if I wrote you?
- Me? Hell, no. That would be great.

757
00:53:28,243 --> 00:53:32,737
想去北滩那家叫寂静人生咖啡的俱乐部吗？
Want to go to this club in North Beach
called the Still Life Cafe?

758
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:34,939
我想有天能去那唱歌。
I want to sing there one day.

759
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,484
等我给你写信，你会明白的。
When I write about it, you'll understand.

760
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:38,917
好啊，行。
Yeah. Sure.

761
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,620
我们也不一定非要去，我只是觉得会不错，但是如果你现在要回去，没事的。
We don't have to. I thought it'd be nice,
but if you have to get back, that's okay.

762
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:47,422
在我明早归队前都没事。
As long as I'm back for formation
in the morning, it's fine.

763
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:51,323
好。
Okay.

764
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:58,061
-你也要给我写信啊。-我会的。
- You got to write me, too.
- I will.

765
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,441
你看起来不太像那种写信的类型。
You don't seem much
like the letter-writing kind.

766
00:54:07,815 --> 00:54:09,578
-你没事吧？-我很好。
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

767
00:54:09,651 --> 00:54:11,676
只是不太喜欢血。
I just don't like blood.

768
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,585
对不起，这是控制不来的。
Sorry. I can't help it.

769
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:17,614
你确定你没事？
You sure you're okay?

770
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:19,221
我很好。
I'm fine.

771
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,951
你马上就能纹好了是吗？
You'll be done soon, right?

772
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,157
很快，看起来多好啊。
Real soon. Looking nice.

773
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:26,629
我不敢相信我们终于纹了。
I can't believe we finally did it.

774
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:29,101
我们已经说说要纹这些蜜蜂说了两个月了。
We talked about getting these bees
for two months.

775
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:33,266
好咯。蜜蜂，这是我的蜜蜂。
There you go. It's a bee. It's my bee.

776
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:37,071
我的蜜蜂在笑诶。
My bee is smiling.

777
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,080
贝尔津，你的蜜蜂脸上有笑容吗？
Berzin, your bee have a smile on his face?

778
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:43,843
这个有个巨大的笑脸，我不觉得像我诶。
This one has a huge grin.
I don't think that's me.

779
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:46,377
看见板上那对胸没？
You see the tits on this broad?

780
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:48,115
很赞。
Nice pair.

781
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:49,622
我的这个也一样的吧？
This gonna look the same?

782
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:51,989
完全一样的蜜蜂？完全一样的位置？
Exact same bee? Exact same spot?

783
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:54,627
有跟长这样的胸的人交往过吗？
Ever been with somebody
with tits like that?

784
00:54:54,696 --> 00:54:57,096
-当然了，你呢？-废话。
- Sure. Haven't you?
- Yeah, sure.

785
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,564
-真的？-是的.
- Really?
- Yes.

786
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:03,028
好吧。
Okay.

787
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:08,869
-奥基，你怎么样了？-没出汗哦。
- Okie, how you doing?
- No sweat.

788
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:12,135
他妈的博雷斯去哪了？该轮到他了。
Where's fucking Birdlace? It's his turn.

789
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:18,111
我告诉你们，要是博雷斯不来，我就替他纹了。
I tell you what. If Birdlace
doesn't show up, I'll get his for him.

790
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:21,178
这么说，吉姆斯恩不存在咯。
So Jim Swaine doesn't exist.

791
00:55:21,255 --> 00:55:24,383
你也不知道谁是伍迪加斯里或者皮特西哲。
And you don't know
who Woody Guthrie is or Pete Seeger.

792
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,752
我所知道的民族歌手只有彼得，鲍尔，和玛丽。
The only folk singers I know
is Peter, Paul and Mary.

793
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,298
-他们在这呢。-很搞笑。
- There they are now.
- Very funny.

794
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,130
彼得，鲍尔和玛丽不是真实的民族歌手。
Peter, Paul and Mary
are not real folk singers.

795
00:55:35,203 --> 00:55:36,192
-不是？-不是。
- No?
- No.

796
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:38,869
真正的民族歌手会自己写歌。
Real folk singers write their own stuff.

797
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,601
他们讲述他们的内心想法。
They say what's on their minds.

798
00:55:40,675 --> 00:55:43,644
-他们是很了不起的。-怎么说？
- They can make things happen.
- How's that?

799
00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:47,072
他们的音乐能改变世界。
Their music can change the world.

800
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,648
要是你想改变世界...
If you want to change the world...

801
00:55:48,716 --> 00:55:51,310
...你干嘛不加入陆战队然后开始射击？
...why don't you join the Marines
and start shooting?

802
00:55:51,386 --> 00:55:53,820
射击能很快改变事物。
Shooting changes things real quick.

803
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:56,283
我无法相信你居然这么说。
I can't believe you just said that.

804
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,954
-呃，我就是说了。-太可笑了。
- Well, I just did.
- That's ridiculous.

805
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:00,824
开枪解决不了任何事情。
Shooting doesn't solve anything.

806
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:03,693
你朝别人开枪，人家也打回来。
You shoot at people,
people shoot back at you.

807
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:06,993
当你对着别人唱歌的时候，你要传达的信息直接就能进入灵魂。
When you sing to people,
your message goes straight to the soul.

808
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:09,969
你打开一个新的观点，且给予缓和。
You open a new point of view.
You disarm them.

809
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:14,441
我只知道肯尼迪总统派遣军队去做出改变...
All I know is that President Kennedy's
sending troops to make some changes...

810
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:16,943
....而且他绝对没有给他们发放吉他.
..and he certainly didn't issue them guitars.

811
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:20,208
有些人用音乐战胜侵略.
There are people who use
music over aggression.

812
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:23,045
听过那首歌“我们万众一心”吗？
Ever heard the song We Shall Overcome?

813
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,912
有什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

814
00:56:26,988 --> 00:56:29,013
干嘛...你为什么笑啊?
What... Why are you laughing?

815
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:31,314
-我没在笑.-你明明在笑.
- I'm not laughing.
- Yes, you are.

816
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:33,053
你觉得这是笑话?
You think this is some joke?

817
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:35,527
你根本没听过那首歌.
You've never even heard this song.

818
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:39,657
瞎说.贝尔津老是在瞎哼这歌.
Bullshit. Berzin goofs on it all the time.

819
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:41,561
真好笑.
That's funny.

820
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:45,066
那只能证明你的朋友不止是个骗子...
All that proves
is that your friend is not only a cheat...

821
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:46,902
...还是个彻底的智障.
...but a complete moron.

822
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,335
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

823
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:53,408
嘿,萝斯!
Hey, Rose!

824
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:56,242
你才认识他,你就叫他骗子?
You just met the guy.
You're calling him a cheat?

825
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:59,115
他就是个骗子.玛西不是他找来的,是他雇来的.
He is a cheat. He didn't find Marcie.
He hired her.

826
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:01,519
-他甚至叫她不要戴她的假牙.-噢,不是吧.
- He even told her not to wear her teeth.
- oh,Come on.

827
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:04,057
他就是这么干的.我偷听到他们为此事争执.
He did. I overheard them fighting about it.

828
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,116
他想把她的那笔分红给赖掉.
He was trying to chisel her out of her share.

829
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:09,129
他不止是个骗子和智障,还是个吝啬鬼.
He's not only a cheat and a moron,
he's a cheapskate.

830
00:57:09,797 --> 00:57:11,560
那个狗日的.
That son of a bitch.

831
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,428
嘿!等下.
Hey! Hold it.

832
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:18,436
怎么回事啊?
What's going on here?

833
00:57:18,506 --> 00:57:21,737
我可不会把在美国的最后几个小时花费在跟你争执上.
I ain't spending my last few hours stateside
arguing with you.

834
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,504
特别是你.我喜欢你.
Especially you. I like you.

835
00:57:24,078 --> 00:57:25,306
该死的.
Damn it.

836
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:28,506
我很抱歉要是...
I'm sorry if...

837
00:57:29,016 --> 00:57:31,985
我很抱歉要是我让你不开心了或怎么着.
I'm sorry if I upset you in any way.

838
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,422
那首歌对我来说很重要,我不想看到它被那样取笑.
That song is very important to me.
I don't like to see it ridiculed like that.

839
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,925
我明白了,对不起.
I understand that. I'm sorry.

840
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:41,985
我也对不起.
I'm sorry.

841
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,228
我对不起.
I'm sorry.

842
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:46,232
不.是我对不起,所以你闭嘴.
No. I'm sorry, so shut up.

843
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,599
谢谢,可是我是真的对不起,所以你闭嘴.
Thank you, but I'm really sorry,
so you shut up.

844
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,676
行,只要一句话,我们会在那的.
Yeah. Just give us the word,
and we're there.

845
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:00,941
-就你们俩?-就我们俩.
- Just the two of you?
- Just the two of us.

846
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,541
她唱歌,我弹奏,然后...
She sings, I play, and...

847
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,347
嘿,鲍勃.
Hey, Bob.

848
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:09,915
-我带他来转转,行不?-行.
- I'm just going to show him around, okay?
- Sure.

849
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:11,757
你之前在哪表演过?
Where did you play?

850
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:15,994
几星期前我们在鲁迪的地方表演过,他们很欣赏我们.
We played over at Rudy's
a couple weeks ago. They really dug us.

851
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:17,553
就是这里.
So this is it.

852
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:19,756
你们有经纪人吗?
You guys have a manager?

853
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:20,801
没有.
No.

854
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:23,693
-挺有意思的,蛮好的.-是啊.
- Well, it's interesting. It's nice.
- Yeah.

855
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:26,331
-你在这唱过歌吗?-没有.
- You ever sing here?
- No.

856
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:30,742
我想等我头发长一点,而且我要自己创作.
I'm waiting for my hair to get longer
and write my own stuff.

857
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:32,676
然后再准备胡特.
Then I'll be ready to hoot.

858
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,711
胡特?什么东西?
Hoot? What's that?

859
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:36,579
跟胡滕南妮有点像.
Short for hootenanny.

860
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:40,217
每个星期四晚上,每个人都能上台来唱歌...
Every Tuesday night,
anybody can come up on stage and sing...

861
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:43,052
...然后要是鲍勃喜欢的话,他就可能会把他们叫回来...
...and if Bob likes them,
he might ask them back...

862
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:45,456
...给他们一次演出机会什么的.
...or give them a gig or something.

863
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:48,655
-你为什么不唱点什么?-什么?
- Why don't you sing something?
- What?

864
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:50,959
唱点什么,比如...
Yeah. Sing something, like...

865
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:54,967
比如你在咖啡馆唱的那首.
Like that song you sang earlier at the cafe.

866
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:57,935
我对那首歌也不太熟悉.
I don't know that song very well.

867
00:58:58,005 --> 00:59:00,906
没事,我就想看你在上面唱.
That's okay.
I just want to see you up there.

868
00:59:09,684 --> 00:59:10,878
呃...
Well...

869
00:59:11,419 --> 00:59:14,547
你有舞台,还有我,作为观众.
You've got the stage.
You've got me as the audience.

870
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:16,782
所以干嘛不唱呢？
So why don't you just sing?

871
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:19,486
求你了？
Please?

872
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:25,857
好吧。
Okay.

873
00:59:30,638 --> 00:59:33,004
我不太会弹钢琴。
I don't know piano all that well.

874
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:34,468
没关系。
That's okay.

875
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,643
我就简单弹弹好了。
I'll just play it very simply.

876
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:43,181
可以。
That's fine.

877
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:45,443
好吧。
Okay.

878
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:45,636
萝斯，紧紧盯住他们的蠢脑瓜子，然后猛击！
Rose, lock your eyes on their numskulls
and brain them!

879
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:50,872
耶！
Yeah!

880
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:11,730
看着，我想你会喜欢这个的。
See, I think that you're going to like this.

881
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:19,083
广告商发现美国的女性...
Advertisers have found
that the women of America...

882
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:22,748
...对她们使用的香皂品种具有相当大的兴趣.
...are keenly interested
in the type of soap they use.

883
01:05:23,624 --> 01:05:27,060

In fact, the men of America

...and how it is used also.

885
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:51,711
外置马达在这个国家...
The outboard motor has brought a
renewed interest...

886
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,946
...为了水上运动带来了新的兴趣.
...in water sports in this country.

887
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,316
伟大的解放啊,不是吗?
Outstanding liberty, isn't it?

888
01:05:57,591 --> 01:05:58,922
太他娘伟大了.
Out-fucking-standing.

889
01:05:58,993 --> 01:06:00,927
...提供练习的湖泊与河流...
...lakes and streams for exercise...

890
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:18,712
我想我该走了.你明天还要早起.
I guess I should go.
You got to get up early in the morning.

891
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:21,004
是啊,你也是.
Yeah. You, too.

892
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:22,307
恩.
Yeah.

893
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:24,516
那么我现在就离开咯.
So I'll just leave now.

894
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:30,113
或者,你可以...
Or, you could...

895
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:32,154
...进来坐一会.
...come in for a minute.

896
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,088
你这么想的吗?
You think so?

897
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,129
是啊,坐一会,要是你想的话.
Yeah, for a little while, if you want.

898
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:38,695
我很乐意.
I'd love to.

899
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:40,923
好吧,走吧.
Okay, let's go.

900
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:42,327
恩.
Okay.

901
01:07:47,968 --> 01:07:49,230
她在睡觉吗?
s she sleeping?

902
01:07:49,303 --> 01:07:51,999
对,她向来都开着电视睡的.
Yeah. She always sleeps with the TV on.

903
01:08:31,044 --> 01:08:32,443
你想听点音乐吗?
Do you want to hear some music?

904
01:08:34,782 --> 01:08:35,874
好啊.
Sure.

905
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:05,841
这些人都是谁?
Who are these people?

906
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:11,849
噢,这是马尔维娜雷诺兹.
Okay. This is Malvina Reynolds.

907
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:15,184
我今天唱的那首歌就是她写的.
She's the one who wrote the song
that I sang today.

908
01:09:15,522 --> 01:09:17,046

那是琼贝兹.
That's Joan Baez.

912
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,520
她是我最喜欢的一个.
She's my favorite.

913
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:27,264
还有那个是鲍勃迪伦.
And there's Bob Dylan.

914
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:29,364
你认识他的对不?
You know him, right?

915
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:33,164
然后那个是奥黛塔,她有最美的声音.
And that's Odetta.
She has the most beautiful voice.

916

还有...
And...

917
01:09:37,144 --> 01:09:39,578
不好意思,没有吉姆斯恩的照片.
Sorry, no pictures of Jim Swaine.

918
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:56,228
你想玩音乐宾果吗?
Do you want to play musical bingo?

919
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:00,063
-好啊.-好.

- Okay.

920
01:10:02,336 --> 01:10:03,928
这个很好玩的.
It's really fun.

921
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:05,861
好呀.
Okay.

922
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:10,568
恩,你可以当大师...
Okay. You can be the maestro...

923
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,470
....然后你拿12片.
..and you get 12 chips.

924
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:15,674
拿着,你可以数数.
Here. You can count those out.

925
01:10:15,749 --> 01:10:18,047
然后我也拿12片...
And I'll get 12, and...

926
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,110
这跟宾果一样吗?
Is this like bingo?

927
01:10:22,823 --> 01:10:24,347
这是音乐宾果.
It's a musical bingo.

928
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:27,054
我不会玩宾果.
I can't play bingo.

929
01:10:28,262 --> 01:10:29,752
-不会?-不会.
- No?
- No.

930
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:31,990
好吧.
Okay.

931
01:10:36,303 --> 01:10:38,168
我们不必玩宾果.
We don't have to play bingo.

932
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,262
不必.
No.

933
01:11:29,856 --> 01:11:32,120
-可以吗?-恩.
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

934
01:11:32,192 --> 01:11:33,284
行?
Yeah?

935
01:11:34,528 --> 01:11:36,689
要我换衣服吗?
Do you think I should change maybe?

936
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:38,628
我要换吗?
Should I change?

937
01:11:39,099 --> 01:11:40,157
啊?
Yeah?

938
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,328
好吧,我去换下.
Okay. I'll change.

939
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:44,900
我的睡裙.
My nightgown.

940
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:47,736
我就...我进这里面去换.
And I'll just... I'll go in here and change.

941
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:12,514
你看起来不错.
You look good.

942
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:23,836
-你看起来很漂亮.-谢谢你.
- You look real good.
- Thank you.

943
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:34,380
不好意思,这床小了点.
Sorry. The bed's small.

944
01:14:28,368 --> 01:14:29,733
我们可以...吗?
Couldn't we just...

945
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:47,680
这是我的地址.
Here's my address.

946
01:14:58,865 --> 01:15:00,890
要是你想的话,可以写信给我.
You can write if you want.

947
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:04,702
照顾好你自己.
Take care of yourself.

948
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:07,030
好的.
Okay.

949
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:10,008
再见,埃迪.
Goodbye, Eddie.

950
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:15,439
再见.
'Bye.

951
01:16:14,374 --> 01:16:16,501
赏点钱买杯咖啡吧?
How about a dime for coffee?

952
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,021
-博雷斯下士报到.-你他妈去哪了?
- Corporal Birdlace reporting for duty.
- Where the hell have you been?

953
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:35,186
Yeah.

954
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,390
我不知道,我忘记了.
I don't know. I forget.

955
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:40,697
我看起来比你好多了.
I look a lot better than you.

956
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:41,756
发生什么事了?
What happened?

957
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:43,860
我们打了一架.
We had a pisser of a time.

958
01:16:44,037 --> 01:16:46,403
扁了几个乌贼混蛋.
Tangled assholes with some squid.

959
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:50,064
去了一家纹身店,遇见了个很感性的女人.
Went to a skin flick,
met a very sensitive woman.

960
01:16:50,143 --> 01:16:54,341
她给我们三个口交,每个人收10块钱,然后在那之前,我们弄了个纹身.
She did the three of us for $10.
And before that, we got a tattoo.

961
01:16:54,414 --> 01:16:55,574
-一只蜜蜂.-给你看看.
- A bee.
- Check it out.

962
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:58,049
蜜蜂代表四蜂团队.你觉得怎样?
A bee for the Four Bees.
What do you think?

963
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,616
挺好的,我喜欢.
I like it, it's nice.

964
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,447
贝尔津代你纹了.
Berzin got yours for you.

965
01:17:02,522 --> 01:17:04,046
给他看看,贝尔津.
Show him, Berz.

966
01:17:11,398 --> 01:17:12,660
死开.
Fuck off.

967
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:17,363
挺好看的.
That's pretty.

968
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:18,630
你欠我一只蜜蜂.
You owe me a bee.

969
01:17:18,838 --> 01:17:20,999
请注意,所有的军事人员.
Attention, all military personnel.

970
01:17:21,074 --> 01:17:22,974
去金银岛的班车即将出发...
The shuttle for Treasure Island departs...

971
01:17:23,043 --> 01:17:24,305
走吧.
Let's go.

972
01:17:29,783 --> 01:17:32,013
怎么说?你到底告不告诉我们?
So? You going to tell us or what?

973
01:17:32,085 --> 01:17:33,712
都说出来呗,博雷斯.
Spit it out, Birdlegs.

974
01:17:33,787 --> 01:17:35,516
我跟她说好不会跟任何人讲的.
I told her I wouldn't tell no one.

975
01:17:35,588 --> 01:17:37,988
拜托,你个混蛋,我们跟你讲.
Come on, you asshole. We tell you.

976
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,851
低调点,她结婚了的.
Keep it down. She was married.

977
01:17:42,929 --> 01:17:45,625
已婚的?她是已婚的?你个王八蛋!她已婚诶.
Married? She was married?
You fuck! She was married.

978
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:48,361
太棒了,下士.太他妈棒了.
Outstanding, Corporal.
Out-fucking-standing.

979
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:50,733
你知道他们怎么说吗,结了婚的是最好的.
You know what they say. Married's best.

980
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:52,795
她们不说出去,她们不怀孕.
'"They don't tell, they don't swell.'"

981
01:17:52,872 --> 01:17:53,861
长得好看吗?
Good-looking?

982
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,465
噢,那是,32岁,金发,身材那是...
Oh, yeah. 32, blond, built like a...

983
01:17:56,576 --> 01:17:59,136
32岁?搞什么?爱操老奶奶?
32? What are you, some grandma-fucker?

984
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:02,340
要是这个老奶奶长成这样.你拿你屁股赌吧.
If the grandmother looked like this,
you bet your ass.

985
01:18:02,415 --> 01:18:04,349
她长得真的很美.
She was real good-looking.

986
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,406
她无法满足.
She couldn't get enough.

987
01:18:05,485 --> 01:18:07,919
她老公不咋关注她,估计是个同志.
Her old man didn't give her attention.
Probably a fag.

988
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:10,751
然后你觉得作为一个少校会怎样做?
What do you expect
from a lieutenant commander in personnel?

989
01:18:10,824 --> 01:18:13,884
一个军官的老婆!太他妈帕!
An officer's wife!
That's out-fucking-standing!

990
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:23,466
你知道么,贝尔津?我觉得你跟我满嘴的胡扯.
You know what, Berzin?
I think you and me are full of shit.

991
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:25,663
拜托,博雷斯,你什么意思?
Come on, Birdlace. What's your beef?

992
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:31,169
那个缺牙的烂货,你带去派对的那个...
That toothless sack of shit
that you took to the party...

993
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:32,711
在斗狗赛里.
The dogfight.

994
01:18:33,747 --> 01:18:35,715
那是事先安排好的对不?
That was a setup, right?

995
01:18:37,283 --> 01:18:39,342
你怎么这么想？
What makes you think that?

996
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:43,781
我昨晚也没和军官的老婆在一起。
I wasn't out with the officer's wife
last night.

997
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,381
我和萝斯在一起。是她告诉我的。
I was out with Rose. She told me.

998
01:18:48,661 --> 01:18:50,822
我就知道她会告诉你。
I figured she was going to do that.

999
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:58,561
昨晚我们在唐人街纹身的时候我看到你跟她在一块。
I saw you with her last night in Chinatown
while we were getting our bees put on.

1000
01:18:58,638 --> 01:19:00,367
你在开玩笑吧。
You're shitting me.

1001
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:03,268
-好极了。-我不会告诉他们的。
- Fucking A.
- I won't tell them.

1002
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:08,138
你也不会告诉他们我在比赛中作弊是不？
Just like you won't tell them
I fixed the fight, right?

1003
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:13,078
我们怎么会变得那么能扯淡？
How did we get to be so full of shit?

1004
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:16,186
我是说，我们怎么变成狗日的白痴了？
I mean, how did we become
these fucking idiots?

1005
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:20,784
我当时坐在这思考，然后...管他呢。
I was sitting here thinking about it, and...
Fuck it.

1006
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,021
我想我也不知道这些是怎么开始的.
I guess I don't know what started it all.

1007
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:24,893
-是啊,别管了.-恩.
- Yeah. Forget about it.
- Right.

1008
01:19:24,964 --> 01:19:26,955
-睡觉吧.-恩.
- Go back to sleep.
- Right.

1009
01:19:28,401 --> 01:19:30,062
不值得.
It ain't worth it.

1010
01:19:31,838 --> 01:19:33,999
所以你是公平的赢得了斗狗赛...
So you won the dogfight fair and square...

1011
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:37,304
...而我昨晚和长官的老婆在一起.
...and I was dating the officer's wife
for one night.

1012
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,970
-收到了,下士.-真是狗屎.
- Roger that, Corporal.
- Bullshit.

1013
01:19:41,714 --> 01:19:43,375
知道我什么意思了吗?
See what I mean?

1014
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,542
知道.
I do.

1015
01:19:45,385 --> 01:19:47,615
我给你讲讲什么事胡扯.
Let me tell you something about bullshit.

1016
01:19:48,354 --> 01:19:49,514
到处都在胡扯.
It's everywhere.

1017
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:53,114
你对我胡扯,我信.
You hit me with a little, I buy it.

1018
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:55,418
我对你胡扯,你信.
I hit you with a little, you buy it.

1019
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:57,920
这不代表我们是傻逼.
It doesn't make us idiots.

1020
01:19:58,431 --> 01:20:00,194
那代表我们是好兄弟.
That's what makes us buddies.

1021
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:04,761
我们信部队跟我们讲的,那使我们成为陆战队员.
We buy what the Corps hands out,
and that's what makes us Marines.

1022
01:20:05,505 --> 01:20:07,905
然后部队听肯尼迪胡扯...
And the Corps is buying the bullshit
from Kennedy...

1023
01:20:07,974 --> 01:20:12,070
...肯尼迪又听每个美国人胡扯.
...and Kennedy's buying the bullshit
from everybody in the US of fuckin' A.

1024
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:15,203
那代表我们是美国人.
And that's what makes us Americans.

1025
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,210
-但还终归到底还是胡扯.-正确.
- It's still bullshit.
- Right.

1026
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:22,345
而我们就身处在我们嘴巴上说出来的胡扯中,老兄.
And we're in it
up to our goddamn lips, buddy.

1027
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:24,384
懂我在说什么吗?
See what I'm saying?

1028
01:20:24,757 --> 01:20:27,055
贝尔津,你还是挺能从万事中找出点道理来的.
Berzin, you can make sense out of anything.

1029
01:20:30,897 --> 01:20:33,297
我不知道我说的有没有意义,不过...
I don't know if I'm making sense, but...

1030
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:37,168
对我来说有很多意义,老兄.
This makes a hell of a lot of sense
to me, boy.

1031
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:40,264
关于这点不是胡扯.
There's no bullshit in this.

1032
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,035
上帝啊.
Jesus.

1033
01:20:43,743 --> 01:20:47,338
真他娘的"迷人",奥基.相当他娘的"迷人".
Very fucking charming, Okie.
Very fucking charming.

1034
01:20:47,413 --> 01:20:49,608
我刚才闻到的是俄克拉荷马香气吗?
Was that the Okie aroma I smell?

1035
01:20:49,682 --> 01:20:52,583
嘿,屎鸟,再跟我说一遍,她是不是很火辣?
Hey, Birdshit, tell me again,
was she a fox or what?

1036
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:54,552
-啥?-那个,军官的老婆.
- What?
- You know, the officer's wife.

1037
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:56,748
她有多美?
How good-looking was she?

1038
01:20:56,823 --> 01:20:58,757
-告诉我.-好吧,告诉他.
- Tell me.
- All right. Tell him.

1039
01:20:58,825 --> 01:21:01,123
我告诉你,你个可悲的狗日的.
I'll tell you this, you sorry son of a bitch.

1040
01:21:01,194 --> 01:21:04,493
她美到你愿意爬过地雷区...
She was so fine,
you'd crawl through a minefield...

1041
01:21:04,564 --> 01:21:08,295
...只为了闻闻拖着她内裤的洗衣车的轮胎.
...just to smell the tires on the laundry
truck hauling away her skivvies.

1042
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,063
不了个是吧!
Get out of here!

1043
01:21:12,138 --> 01:21:13,400
滚开!
Get off of me!

1044
01:21:13,973 --> 01:21:14,962
嘿,拜托.
Hey, come on!

1045
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,201
别弄到我的头发.
Watch my hair!

1046
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,714
-戴利.-到.
- Daley.
