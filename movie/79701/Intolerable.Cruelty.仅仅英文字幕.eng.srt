I'd always picked him as some sort of
deadbeat, but happy to be proved wrong.

Yeah, well, if the cruise goes
all the way around the lake,

she's left the state, and she's in breach.

Yes, your husband did show remarkable
foresight in taking those pictures.

102
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,739
And, yes, absent a swimming pool,

103
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,658
the presence of a pool man
would appear to be suspicious.

104
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:23,705
But, madam, who is the real victim here?
Let me suggest to you the following.

105
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,459
Your husband, who on a prior occasion
had slapped you, beat you.

106
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,502
- I think that word is not inappropriate.
- No, I...

107
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,548
Let me finish, please. I'm not concerned
with who slapped whom first.

108
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,592
Your husband,
who had beaten you repeatedly...

109
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,676
No, he never...

110
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,971
Please. Repeatedly, was at the time,
brandishing your firearm.

111
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,057
- It was his gun.
- And we'll get it back for you.

112
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:47,562
Trying, in his rage, to shoot an
acquaintance, a friend of long standing.

113
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,730
They never really cared for each other.

114
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,900
And if not for your cool-headed intervention,

115
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,944
his tantrum might have ended
this schmo's life and ruined his own.

116
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,783
As for the sexual indiscretion
which he imagined took place,

117
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,328
wasn't it, in fact,
he who was sleeping with the pool man?

118
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:10,168
No? Am I going too far here?
Were his sexual... No.

119
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,253
- I don't...
- Sorry. I'm not omniscient.

120
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,216
The point is that he acted upon
an assumption which he cannot prove,

121
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,010
and, I take it, you deny.

122
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,970
- Well...
- Fine. I'll take the case.

123
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,349
It's imperative that I meet with Oliver Olerud
before we proceed any further,

124
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,520
so that I can massage
the kinks out of our testimony.

125
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,730
Do you really think
we could put all this across?

126
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,983
The truth is so self-evident to me,
Mrs. Donaly,

127
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:38,405
that I'm sure that I'll be able to make it
equally as transparent to any jury,

128
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,365
should your husband decide
to take it that far.

129
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,202
We'll need to caucus again to draw up
a picture of your husband's net worth.

130
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,123
A map of enemy territory, so to speak.
You said that he's a television producer?

131
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,292
He has a soap opera, The Sands of Time.
It's a silly show.

132
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,713
Well, it'll be yours soon.
Thank you very much.

133
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,341
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Massey.
- Yes. Bye-bye.

134
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,055
Still you have to admire him
for taking those pictures.

135
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,559
LAWYER: Now, Mrs. Gutman, you testified

136
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:13,565
that you were your husband's sexual slave
for 36 years during your marriage.

137
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,610
Except for two years when he was
in the Navy in Southeast Asia.

138
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,572
And before your marriage,
what was your profession?

139
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,283
MRS. GUTMAN: I was a hostess
for BraniffAirlines.

140
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,702
And what is your husband's profession?

141
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:31,166
He manufactures staples and industrial
brad tacks. He's very successful.

142
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,087
How would you describe
your husband's sexual proclivities?

143
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,675
Well, at first,
he was a very gentle and tender lover.

144
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,470
But then he became more and more fixated

145
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,306
on toys and machinery
and devices of various kinds.

146
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,602
I can't help it. You don't decide
to become bored. It just happens.

147
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,855
You're just looking for trouble.
It's a midlife crisis.

148
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,066
Look, get yourself a new car.

149
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:02,405
I have a new car. I have two new cars.
I have a tab at the Mercedes dealership.

150
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,284
Torn the house down twice.
Rebuilt the cabin in Vail.

151
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,787
Got three of those yard people.

152
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,332
- Gardeners.
- Gardeners. Got a man who waxes my jet.

These encounters were videotaped.
Sometimes there would be a gismo.

154
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:22,008
- LAWYER: A gismo?
- He had a device he called The Intruder.

155
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,886
It was something he had the engineers
at the factory design.

156
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,098
And then he had a prototype built
out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner.

157
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,225
I see.

158
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,311
So the vacuum cleaner wasn't available
to me for several months.

159
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,773
- Several months without the appliance?
- Yes.

160
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,150
Problem is
everyone is willing to compromise.

161
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:43,696
That's the problem with the institution
of marriage. It's based on compromise.

162
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,825
Even through its dissolution.
Mrs. Gutman here,

163
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,245
she's gonna score some points concerning
her husband's sexual politics.

164
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,788
Naturally, we'll try to impeach.

165
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,250
And then the entire process
will find an equilibrium point

166
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,836
based on the skill of the individual lawyers.

167
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,840
And then both parties will go home
with their portion of the staple factory.

168
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:06,052
- That's life. Life is compromise.
- That's not life. That's death.

169
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,059
Struggle and challenge and ultimate
destruction of your opponent, that's life.

Let me ask you something. Attila the Hun.
lvan the Terrible. Henry the Eighth.

171
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,609
What do they have in common?

172
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,364
- Middle name?
- No, they didn't just win.

173

- They destroyed.
- JUDGE: Mr. Massey? Mr. Massey?

174

Again I ask, have you any questions
for the complainant?

175
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,252
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I was just consulting with an associate.

176
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:45,174
Now, Mrs. Gutman, do you know
a man named David Gonzalez?

177
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,179
Well, he's the tennis pro at the club.

178
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,640
The tennis pro?

- That's a fart in a stiff wind.

for 50% of the marital assets.

Why only 50, Freddy? Why not 100?

00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,250
- and photograph her address book.
- No, Wrigley.

454
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,087
I happened to let a man know
that I was interested in her address book.

455
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,130
That's not criminal.

456
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,966
I also happened to let him know
that I was taking her out to dinner.

457

That's not a crime either. No, I don't see
myself as culpable in any sense.

- Tenzing Norgay.

Tenzing Norgay.
That's someone she slept with.

463
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,950
I doubt it. Tenzing Norgay was the Sherpa

464
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,035
that helped Edmund Hillary
climb Mount Everest.

465

And Marylin knows him.

No, you idiot. Not the Tenzing Norgay.

would be transparent to the world.

Objection, Your Honor!

Finally, a man whom
she could herself brazenly cuckold

until such time as she might choose to...

We would say,
"Faire un coup de marteau sur des fesses."

You would say,
"Make hammer on his fanny."

- Your Honor, objection! lrrelevant!
- I'm going to allow it!

Tell us, Baron,
did you introduce her to such a man?

Sir, I am the concierge!

614

And to whom did you introduce
that calculating woman?

615

I introduced her to that silly man.

618
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,137
Let the record show that the Baron
has identified Rex Rexroth as the silly man!

619
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:18,516
I did it! It was I!
I introduced her to that silly man!

633

They bought Massey's argument.

634

If I lied and cheated
and was with Rex only for his money,

then he shouldn't have to give me any.

build a cottage.

More landscaping.

651

Well, with my money,
I can't afford to be fooling around.

652

And besides, I have you.
It'll be fun, just the girls.

Well, thanks, Sarah,
but I can't sleep on your couch forever.

Oh, you must be talking about Grandpa John.
My papa's John D., too.

706
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,504
The Deuce, we called him.
You know, kind of the rebel of the family.

707
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,548
But they knocked off
that whole John D. routine

708
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,299
when they christened
little old yours truly here.

709
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,510
Grandpa nearly had a stroke.

710
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,388
He did have a stroke, but that was later,
during the labor activity in '52.

711
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,975
The government stepped in.
They called it mediation.

712
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:38,020
He called it incipient communism, you know,
and of course, that's when he had his stroke.

713
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,357
Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog.

- Well, that is fascinating, Mr. Doyle.

- What say we have a seat?
- A seat?

Here Marylin's had me runnin'
up and down Rodeo Drive all day long.

- right off of Wilshire...
- It's been quite a day.

721
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,835
- Had pewter things.
- But anyway, Miles,

722
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:06,674
I know you're busy, and you charge
by the hour, so I'll get straight to the point.

723
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,677
Howard D. and I are planning to marry.

724
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,765
Well...

725
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,060
Well, I suppose that congratulations
are in order.

726
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,396
HOWARD: Well, thank you, Miles.
You know, the urge to wedlock

727
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,817
and form a lasting monogamous bond
sanctified by ritual, it's pert-near universal.

728
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,404
As a matter of fact, it might be of some
interest to you, being in a related business.

729
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,365
Even your indigenous Americans,
I believe it was your Cree, used to...

730
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,661
Howard and I are here because
I've learned through bitter experience

731
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:40,207
that when it comes to matrimony and law,
you are the very best.

732
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,920
And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage

733
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:48,549
ended in an unjustified stain
upon my reputation.

734
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:54,055
My motives were impugned.
I was slandered in court.

735
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,724
I was painted a harlot.

736
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,394
- Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot.
- Oh, yes, honey.

737
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:04,899
So it's my desire
to remove any trace of suspicion

738
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,945
from the mind of my dear Howard Doyle.

739
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,780
Oh, honey, come on, now.

740
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,949
I wish to execute a prenuptial agreement.

741
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:16,494
And I'm dead-set against it.
I mean, just anti the whole deal.

742
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:20,331
Howard's lawyers prefer it. I insist upon it.

743
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:24,251
Oh, damn lawyers. No offense to
the present company or anything, you know.

744
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:29,090
Now, is it my understanding that the Massey
prenup has never been penetrated?

745
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,424
That is correct.

746
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,303
Not to blow my own horn, but they devote
an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.

747
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,472
They got a hell of a school up there.
Ain't no doubt about it.

748
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,641
We donated that Doyle building up there
here a while back.

749
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,725
MILES: Mmm-hmm.

750
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,187
Now, I myself went to Texas A&M.
I'm an Aggie.

751
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,815
- Business?
- Tight end.

752
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,693
And I had a fair amount of success
against the split-T defense.

753
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,695
You see, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

754
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,488
it allows me to buttonhook and, you know,

for any reason,

762

both parties will leave it with
what they brought in and earned during.

Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck.

01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,961
and all of a sudden,
the rules of the moral universe don't apply.

909
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,505
When God is dead, all things are possible.

910
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,466
I saw an ad in the paper,

911
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:42,763
"No-fault divorce.
Two-week divorce without a lawyer."

912
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:46,141
Made me sick to my stomach.
"No-fault divorce."

913
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,519
Good God. Talk about your oxymoron.

914
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,356
- What's the world coming to?
- One man can only do so much.

915
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,317
One man... What are you talking about?

916
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,777
Freddy.

917
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,570
WRIGLEY: Mmm. I had lunch with
Freddy Bender yesterday.

918
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,032
He tells me that Marylin Rexroth-Doyle
is now richer than Croesus.

919
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:05,452
Ah, yes, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?

920
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,622
She could buy and sell you 10 times over.

921
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,000
My God, is that her?

922
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,168
Mmm.

923
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:17,172
Freddy said she was flying in with him.
Celebrating, I guess.

924
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:20,759
I'm fascinated by that creature.
Richer than me, huh?

925
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:25,430
Well, she deserves every penny.
And now she's single again.

926
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,350
Excuse me.

927
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,769
No, you should stay away from her, Miles.

928
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,271
Recite your keynote address.
Take a cold shower.

929
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,741
- You're looking well, Marylin.
- Hello, Miles.

930
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:48,203
Obscene wealth becomes you.

931
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,707
- I should've known you'd be here.
- Be here?

932
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,668
- I'm the keynote speaker.
- How nice for you.

Oh!

936
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,304
- Oh, I'm sure you'll bring the house down.
- It's an easy crowd.

937
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,391
At this point, I would think
you're probably the only person

938
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:12,352
- that I can't teach anything to.
- Really?

939
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,603
Mmm.

940
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:18,108
Now, correct me,
but since by now the ink must be dry,

941
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:21,611
- I believe I have the right to collect.
- On?

942
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,948
You promised to have dinner with me
once you were free.

943
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:29,119
I said I wouldn't whilst I wasn't,
which implies no promise once I am.

944
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,788
Noted. Let me rephrase.

945
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:36,334
I would be delighted, honored really,
if you'd... (GASPS)

- I'm sentimental.

950
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:52,851
Well, I'm free this evening, so I suppose
a little dinner would do no harm.

Yes. Thank you. I'll take care of it.

953
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,197
Marylin, this is a moment to savor.

954
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:10,619
Yes, we were adversaries,
but we were also professionals.

955
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:16,625
So let us raise a glass to friendship.

956
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,796
To victory.

957
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:29,221
So how does it feel?

958
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,433
- Sorry?
- Victory. Independence.

Oh.

960
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,900
- Well, frankly, Miles...
- It's not everything you'd hoped for?

961
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,864
I know the feeling.

962
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,619

- Ah.
- Hmm.

967
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,682
Anyway, three fine settlements.

968
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,142
More money
than she could ever hope to spend.

969

- Yes.
- Her vaunted independence.

970
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,189
Don't tell me. She sits around the house,

971
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,984
afraid to see people,
afraid to put her portfolio into play.

It's a word we matrimonial lawyers avoid.

1067
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,904
Funny, isn't it?
We're frightened of this emotion,

1068
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:34,409
which is, in a sense,
the seed of our livelihood.

Well, today Miles Massey is here to tell you
that love need cause us no fear.

Now I am, of course, aware

1075
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:08,693
that these remarks
will be received here with cynicism.

1076
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,239
Cynicism, that cloak
that advertises our indifference

1077
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:15,533
and hides all human feeling.

1078
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:19,078
Well, I'm here to tell you that that cynicism
which we think protects us,

1079
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,873
in fact, destroys.

1080

Destroys love, destroys our clients,
and, ultimately, destroys ourselves.

Colleagues, when our clients come to us
confused and angry and hurting

1082
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:37,180
because their flame of love is guttering
and threatens to die,

1083
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,557
do we seek to extinguish that flame

1084
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:43,478
so that we can sift through the smoldering
wreckage for our paltry reward?

1085
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,314
Or do we fan this precious flame,

1086
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:51,360
this most precious flame,
back into loving, roaring life?

1087
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:57,825
Do we counsel fear or trust?
Do we seek to destroy or build?

1088
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,413
Do we meet our clients' problems
with cynicism

01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,750
or with love?

1090
