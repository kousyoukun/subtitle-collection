1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:05,242

May I introduce
Howard D. Doyle
of Doyle Oil.

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,245

I'm goddamn pleased
to meet you.

3
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:09,804

Marylin here,
she says you're the best.
Says you're aces.

4
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:12,579

Well, thank you, Mr., uh--

5
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:17,089

h, any-- any relation
toJohn D. Doyle of Doyle Oil?

6
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:20,251

Oh, you must be talkin'
about Grandpa John.
My papa's John D. too.

7
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:23,261

The Deuce, we called him.
You know, kinda the rebel
of the family.

8
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,423

But they knocked off
that wholeJohn D. routine
when they christened Yours Truly.

9
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:28,490

[ Chuckling ]
Grandpa nearly had a stroke.

10
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:32,197

He did have a stroke,
but that was later,
during the labor activity in '52.

11
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:34,206

The government
stepped in.
Mm-hmm. h--

12
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:36,299

They called it mediation.
Well--

13
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:38,344

He called it
incipient communism.

14
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:40,345

Of course, that's when
he had his stroke.

15
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:43,348

Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog.

16
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,351

He lingered in a vegetative state
for years--
Well, that is fascinating, Mr. Doyle.

17
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:48,353

What say we have a seat?
A seat?

18
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,857

Marylin's had me runnin'
up and down Rodeo Drive all day long.

19
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:54,860

Kinda hit-and-run shoppin', you know.
Take no prisoners.

20
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:57,863

Forced march kind of thing.
My God, my dogs are barkin'.

21
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,866

We started out at this li'l ol' place
right off of Wilshire--
It's been quite a day.

22
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,799

Had pewter things.

23
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:07,670

But anyway, Miles, I know you're busy
and you charge by the hour,
so I'll get straight to the point.

24
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:11,506

Howard D. and I
are planning to marry.

25
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:17,315

Well--

26
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:20,841

Well, I suppose
that congratulations are in order.
[ Doyle ] Well, thank you, Miles.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,153

You know, the urge to wedlock
and form a lastin'monogamous bond
sanctifiied by ritual, it's pert-near universal.

28
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:30,185

As a matter of fact,
it might be of some interest to you,
bein'in a related business--

29
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,198

Even your indigenous Americans--
h, I believe it was your Cree-- used to--

30
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:37,202

Howard and I are here
because I've learned,
through bitter experience,

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,434

that when it comes
to matrimony and law,
you are the very best.

32
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:45,569

And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage...

33
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:49,046

ended in an unjustified stain...

34
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:51,049

upon my reputation.

35
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:53,051

My motives were impugned.

36
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,451

I was slandered in court.

37
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:58,218

I was painted a harlot.

38
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,225

Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot.

39
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,227

Oh, yes, honey.

40
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:06,732

So it's my desire to remove
any trace of suspicion...

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,361

from the mind
of my dear Howard Doyle.

42
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:12,370

Oh, honey, come on, now.

43
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,770

I wish to execute
a prenuptial agreement.

44
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:18,277

And I'm dead-set against it.
I mean,just anti the whole deal.

45
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,278

Howard's lawyers prefer it.

46
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:22,280

I insist upon it.

47
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:26,079

Oh, damn lawyers.
h, no offense to the present company
or anything, you know.

48
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:29,781

Now, is it my understanding
that the Massey prenup
has never been penetrated?

49
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:32,991

That is correct.

50
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:36,085

Not to blow my own horn,
but they devote an entire semester to it
at Harvard Law.

51
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:39,131

They got a hell of a school up there,
ain't no doubt about it.

52
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,134

We donated that Doyle building
up there here a while back.
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,966

Now, I myself went to Texas A&M.
I'm an Aggie.

54
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:46,972

- Business?
- Tight end.

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,975

And I had a fair amount of success
against the split-T defense.

56
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:52,511

See, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

57
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,413

it allows me to buttonhook
and,you know, do a down-and-in,
up-and-out and diOerent things--

58
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,575

post pattern
every now and then.

59
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,585

Your tight ends
don't generally run a post.

60
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,814

[ Stammering ]
But if the QB calls it,
hell, I'm ready.

61
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,151

Interrupt for a second?
Yeah.

62
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:09,093

I wanna make sure
that you both understand...
what it is you're asking.

63
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:12,996

The Massey prenup
provides that in the event
of a dissolution of the marriage,

64
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,000

for any reason,

65
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:19,027

both parties will leave it
with what they brought in...
and earned during.

66
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,040

No one can profit
from the marriage.

67
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,305

The prenup protects
the wealthier party.

68
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:30,441

Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck.

69
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:33,451

Not a hell of a lot
of romance in that.

70
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,987

No, sir, there is not.
No romance.

71
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,649

More to the point,
no wriggle room.

72
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:42,126

So, are we sure...

73
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,153

that this is what we want?

74
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:47,699

Absolutely.

75
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,136

It's my gift to Howard,

76
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,900

for his peace of mind,

77
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:57,238

whether or not
he's worried about it
at this moment.

78
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,575

Oh, honey pie,
do I look worried?

79
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,451

Excuse me, Mr. Doyle.

80
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,454

Could I just borrow
your charming fiancee
for a moment?

81
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,956

Well, okay.
You gon' leave a deposit?

82
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,016

[ Both Laughing ]

83
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:20,531

What are you up to?

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,535

Something
you won't understand, Miles.

85
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:26,037

Howard and I are very much in love.

86
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:30,439

I don't know what you're thinking,
but I have to warn you, the Massey prenup
has never been penetrated.

87
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,173

You sign the prenup,
you can't get his money.

88
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,215

Thanks for the professional help.

89
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:39,217

Marylin, think of me for a moment...

90
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:42,413

not as an attorney but as a friend.

91
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:45,423

Does that mean you won't be
charging us for the hour?

92
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,460

Dump him.
You can't nail his ass.

93
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:52,187

Is that all?

94
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,268

No, that's not all.

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,748

[ Exhales ]

96
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:15,443

I could have you disbarred for that.

97
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,149

It was worth it.

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,653

A romantic divorce attorney.

99
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,000

You fascinate me.
