1
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,806
Bonnie?

2
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,865
Who is it?

3
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,746
Donovan?

4
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,314
Bonnie?
Yes?

5
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,318
Donovan?

6
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,357
In here;!

7
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,605
Yes? Donovan;
Is everything all right?

8
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,170
Yeah; The production meeting
was put off, so I thought... Who's here?

9
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,182
Here?
Mm.

10
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,650
Who owns that piece-of-shit van down there?

11
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,653
Oh...

12
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:12,215
It's just a guy, you know,
going door-to-door
selling... pool cleaner.

13
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,955
So why did he
lock himself in the den?

14
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,963
Well, he...

15
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,965
Oh, God.

16
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,297
- Remember my friend Ollie?
- Ollie Olerud?

17
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,667
Short, cretinous wanker?

18
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,138
Ohh. Ollie's in there?

19
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,438
- Yes.
- I see.

20
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,981
Well, I'm glad
he finally got himself a job.

21
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,678
I'd always picked him
as some sort of deadbeat,
but... happy to be proved wrong.

22
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,744
So, he's selling
pool cleaner now, huh?

23
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,849
Well, this is the neighborhood for that.
Just door-to-door...
"Running low on chlorine?"

24
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,827
It's quite a coincidence,
him just dropping by...

25
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,830
and you two
knowing each other so well.

26
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,662
Donovan, please,
let's just all talk...
How you doin'?

27
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,067
Donovan? How you doin', man?

28
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,038
Good day, Ollie;
I'm great; You?

29
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,008
I... can't complain, man.

30
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,011
Excellent.

31
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,014
Well, let's get
right down to it then,
shall we?

32
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:12,519
We'll take a couple vacuum hoses.
We probably need a new filter
right about now, maybe...

33
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,851
Wait a minute, darling.
Do we actually have
a swimming pool?

34
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,825
Okay, okay, man. Now, let's be
reasonable about this, okay?

35
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,861
So, you caught me porkin'...

36
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,863
havin'relations
with your old lady; ; ;

37
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,865
Oh, God.

38
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,562
And now we're all feelin'
just a little bit embarrassed
by the whole thing, so, uh...

39
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,570
What the hey, man.

40
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,096
I mean, I know it's a drag and all,
but these things...

41
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,870
Hey! Hey, hey.

42
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,436
Uh, w-we... we...
we didn't actually have sex;

43
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:45,076
I was depressed 'cause
I'm impotent. You know?

44
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,712
Unable to achieve an erection.

45
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,416
I have been
for over a year now, man,

46
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,755
and I needed someone to talk to.

47
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,727
I mean, think about it, man;
Ayear without an erection?

48
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,560
Leave him alone!

49
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,338
- You should've seen this coming,
you Australian piece of shit!
- You bitch;!

50
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,898
That's my Daytime Television
Lifetime Achievement Award!

51
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,604
Cheesy bastard!
Aaah!

52
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,814
You whore;!

53
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,148
Oh, Christ!

54
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,379
Okay.

55
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,157
All right, you want fun and games?
All right.

56
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,288
I'll give you fun and games.

57
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,356
Explain this away.

58
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,440
Aaah! Ollie!

59
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,001
That's myJag;!
That's myJag;!

60
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,014
That's my bloodyJag!

61
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,550
You bitch!

62
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,950
Bitch! Bitch!

63
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,615
Bye-bye, baby!

64
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,152
Oh, what are you looking at?

65
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,631
Explain this away, darling.

66
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,230
Miles Massey's office.
Hey, it's me. Any messages?

67
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,289
Yeah, quite a few.
Where are you?
Just whitening.

68
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,461
Jim says he wants a meeting
today, if possible;
Mm-hmm; What else?

69
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,970
Chapman says his wife
is now in Tahoe.

70
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,904
Tell Amstedler
I'll return in 20 minutes,

71
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,205
get Wrigley to look up
Oliphant v; Oliphant,
Commonwealth of Virginia; ; ;

72
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,837
for its relevance
in the Chapman filing...

73
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,144
Oliphant v; Oliphant,
relevance to Chapman...
She said she took the kids to Tahoe?

74
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,151
That's right.
Wait, which side
ofTahoe?

75
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,153
She's on some kind of cruise.

76
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,657
Yeah, well, if the cruise
goes all the way around the lake,
she's left the state and she's in breach.

77
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,158
Tell Wrigley to prepare
a filing to attach.
A filing to attach.

78
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,161
What do you want in it?
Everything.

79
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,164
Primary residence, beach house,
ski cabin, auto, stocks, bonds,
dental floss.

80
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,427
Everything.
Uh-huh. Gonna lose ya.

81
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,435
Uh-huh.

82
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,098
And tell Fred Armatrading
that we finally have pictures of his wife
with the oral surgeon.

83
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,872
Oh, and get a fruit and pastry basket
in the conference room for my 9:30.
Didn't have time for breakfast.

84
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,037
Where are you?
Comin' at ya.

85
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,778
Your 9:00 is here.
Bonnie Donaly.

86
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,512
Bonnie Donaly.

87
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,217
Mrs. Donaly.

88
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,231
Hmm.

89
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,636
Mm-hmm.

90
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,139
Hmm.

91
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:11,041
Yes, your husband did show remarkable
foresight in taking those pictures,

92
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,512
and, yes,
absent a swimming pool,

93
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,516
the presence of a pool man
would appear to be suspicious.

94
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,781
But, madam,
who is the real victim here?

95
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,788
Let me suggest to you
the following.

96
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,791
Your husband,
on a prior occasion,
had slapped you... beat you;

97
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,555
I think that word
is not inappropriate;
No, l...

98
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,562
Let me finish, please.

99
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,064
I'm not concerned
with who slapped whom first.

100
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,567
Your husband,
who had beaten you repeatedly...
No, he never...

101
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,661
Please... repeatedly, was at the time
brandishing your firearm.

102
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,674
- It was his gun.
- And we'll get it back for you.

103
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,609
Trying, in his rage,
to shoot an acquaintance,

104
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,612
a friend of long standing.

105
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,080
They never really cared
for each other.

106
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,083
And if not for your
cool-headed intervention,

107
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,086
his tantrum might have ended
this schmo's life and ruined his own.

108
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,591
As for the sexual indiscretion
which he imagined took place,

109
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,355
wasn't it in fact he...
who was sleeping with the pool man?

110
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,991
No?
Am I going too far here?

111
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,002
Were his sexual... No.
I don't...

112
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,004
Sorry. I'm not omniscient.

113
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,166
The point is
that he acted upon an assumption
which he cannot prove,

114
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,506
and I take it you deny.

115
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,011
- Well...
- Fine. I'll take the case.

116
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,379
It's imperative
that I meet with Oliver Olerud
before we proceed any further; ; ;

117
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,546
so that I can massage the kinks
out of our testimony.

118
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,782
Do you really think
we can put all this across?

119
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,053
The truth is so self-evident
to me, Mrs. Donaly,

120
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:37,460
that I'm sure I'll be able to make it
equally as transparent to anyjury,

121
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,465
should your husband
decide to take it that far.

122
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:43,230
We'll need to caucus again
to draw up a picture
of your husband's net worth.

123
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,737
A map of enemy territory,
so to speak.

124
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,741
You said he's a television producer?
He has a soap opera...
The Sands of Time;

125
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,743
It's a silly show.

126
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,745
Well, it'll be yours soon.

127
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,747
Thank you very much.

128
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,147
Thank you, Mr. Massey.
Yeah. Bye-bye.

129
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,887
Still, you have to admire him
for taking those pictures.

130
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,524
Now, Mrs; Gutman,

131
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,528
you testified that you were
your husband's sexual slave; ; ;

132
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,531
for 36 years
during your marriage;

133
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:16,695
Except for two years
when he was in the navy
in Southeast Asia.

134
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,705
And before your marriage,
what was your profession?

135
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,435
I was a hostess
for Braniff Airlines;

136
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,205
And what is
your husband's profession?

137
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,577
He manufactures staples
and industrial brad tacks.

138
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,582
He's very successful;

139
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,178
How would you describe
your husband's sexual proclivities?

140
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,715
Well, at first he was
a very gentle and tender lover.

141
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,728
But then he became
more and more fixated; ; ;

142
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,731
on toys and machinery
and devices of various kinds;

143
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,734
I can't help it.
You don't decide to become bored.

144
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,236
It just happens.
You're just looking for trouble.

145
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,238
It's a midlife crisis.

146
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,900
Look, get yourself
a new car.

147
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,910
I have a new car.

148
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,436
I have two new cars and a tab
at the Mercedes dealership.

149
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,379
Torn the house down
twice,

150
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,315
rebuilt
the cabin in Vail,

151
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,320
got three of those, uh...
yard people...

152
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,414
Gardeners?
Gardeners. I've got a man
who waxes my jet.

153
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,721
These encounters
were videotaped.

154
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,091
Sometimes
there would be a gizmo.

155
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,096
A gizmo?

156
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,099
He had a device
he called the Intruder.

157
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,000
It was something he had
the engineers at the factory design;

158
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,166
And then he had a prototype built
out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner;

159
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,072
I see.

160
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,078
So the vacuum cleaner
wasn't available to me
for several months;

161
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,808
Several months
without the appliance;
Yes!

162
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,817
The problem is,
everyone is willing
to compromise.

163
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,321
That's the problem with
the institution of marriage.
It's based on compromise.

164
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,323
Even through
its dissolution.

165
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,326
Mrs. Gutman here,
she's gonna score some points...

166
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,328
concerning her husband's
sexual politics.

167
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,330
Naturally,
we'll try to impeach.

168
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,333
And then the entire process
will find an equilibrium point...

169
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,835
based on the skill
of the individual lawyers.

170
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:01,033
Then both parties will go home
with their portion
of the staple factory.

171
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,041
That's life.
Life is compromise.

172
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,168
That's not life.
That's death.

173
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,107
Struggle and challenge
and ultimate destruction
of your opponent... that's life.

174
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,118
Let me ask you
something.

175
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,120
Attila the Hun.

176
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,123
Thank you, Mrs. Gutman.
Ivan the Terrible.
Henry the Eighth.

177
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,659
Mr. Massey, any questions?
What do they have in common?

178
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,630
Middle name.
No. They didn't just win.
They... They...

179
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,633
Mr; Massey?
They destroyed...

180
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,726
Mr; Massey, again I ask,

181
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,795
have you any questions
for the complainant?

182
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,899
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I was just consulting
with an associate.

183
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,546
Now, Mrs. Gutman,

184
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,242
do you know a man
named David Gonzalez?

185
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,246
Well, he's the tennis pro at the club.

186
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,688
The tennis pro?

187
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:58,021
Then why are your letters addressed to him,
"Dear David and Goliath"?

188
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,026
Whoo! Whoo!

189
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,644
Go, Rexie!

190
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,714
Go, Rexie baby!

191
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,100
Whoo-hoo;!

192
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,467
Whoo!

193
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,635
Rexie!

194
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,934
Cabin seven.

195
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,441
Choo-choo!

196
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,454
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

197
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,459
Choo-choo!

198
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,333
Choo-choo.

199
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,241
Choo-choo!

200
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,644
- Choo-choo.

201
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,945
- Choo-choo.
- Choo-choo.

202
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,111
Choo-choo;

203
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,281
- Choo-choo!
- Whoo-whoo!

204
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,293
Choo-choo!

205
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,091
Ahh! Oh! Choo!

206
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,867
Yeah!

207
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,132
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

208
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,366
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

209
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,710
Oh, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
Yo' ass!

210
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,679
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
Come to papa!

211
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,183
I'm gon'nail ya;!
Yeah, I got ya;!

212
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,152
I'm gon'nail yo'ass;!
Enough, I say!

213
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,155
Hold it;!
I'm gon'nail yo'ass;!

214
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,157
Yeah;! Yeah;!

215
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,819
A silly misunderstanding...
Mm-hmm;
Someone nailed yo'ass;!

216
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,955
Mm-hmm, yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

217
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,329
I'm gon'nail yo' ass!

218
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,664
Yep, I nailed his ass.

219
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,637
I thought he'd outgrown trains.

220
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,300
They never grow up, lady.
They just get tubby.

221
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,173
How charming. An aphorist.

222
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,645
Oh, yeah, I've always
had ample proportions.

223
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,649
But believe you me, it's all muscle.
I'm as hard as a rock.

224
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,880
I'm not one of these cream puff,
sit-behind-the-desk private dicks.

225
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,887
I'm an ass-nailer.
So I see.

226
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,890
Gym four times a week...
hour and a half, plus stretching,

227
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,222
LifeCycle, LifeStep, LifeCircuit.

228
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,228
Gus Petch don't pussyfoot around.

229
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:48,199
I must say, for someone in your line of work,
you don't exhibit a great deal of tact.

230
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,396
You want tact, call a tactician.
You want an ass nailed,
you call Gus Petch.

231
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,406
Christ, you seem to be
taking it pretty good.

232
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:58,240
I seen 'em come in here,
weep and wail
like Baptists at a funeral;

233
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:01,747
Like they hired me to prove
their husbands weren't foolin' around.

234
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,510
Don't get me wrong, Mr., um...
Petch;

235
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,518
Gus Petch.

236
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,750
Whilst I don't find this terribly amusing,
I am delighted that you found this material;

237
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,319
This is going to be
my passport to wealth,

238
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,421
independence and freedom.

239
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,432
[Chuckling]

240
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,230
Sounds like to me
you gon' nail his ass.

241
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,311
Honey? Honey!

242
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,610
Rex, get away from the door;

243
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,617
Honey?

244
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,619
My key doesn't work.

245
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,621
Can we talk about this?

246
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,623
Rex, get away
from the door.

247
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,125
Oh, look, I know
that you're upset, honey.

248
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,629
Rex, for your own safety,
get away from the door.

249
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,131
I don't like having
to set the dogs on you.

250
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,929
Oh, for crying out loud,
if we could... Dogs?

251
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,082
Yes, dogs.

252
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,417
I wanted some security
since I'll be living here alone;

253
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,822
Look, Marylin, can't we have
a civilized discussion about this?
Our lawyers can.

254
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,159
- Aaah!

255
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,589
You have a discovery hearing at 5:30
for the Maxine Gopnick case;

256
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,599
Discovery? Gopnick?
And a Lance Kelso called.

257
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,601
He read your article
about palimony settlements...
Lance Kelso.

258
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,432
In same-sex
partnerships...

259
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,438
and would like to schedule
an appointment.
Same-sex.

260
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,441
Arthur Yardumian
and his tax attorney want to reschedule
their caucus for tomorrow.

261
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,444
Yardumian?
Arthur had to fly to Atlanta
for a deadbeat dad hearing.

262
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,174
Atlanta?
And your 10:30 is here.
Rex Rexroth.

263
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,775
- Rex Rexroth?
- Real estate. He's okay.

264
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,690
Mr. Rexroth.

265
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,726
Uh, call me Rex.
Please.

266
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,728
Miles Massey.
Please sit. Relax.

267
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:01,893
Consider this office your office,
your haven, your war room
for the duration of the campaign.

268
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,868
Thank you.

269
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,870
Now, sir...

270
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,872
tell me your troubles.

271
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,805
Well...

272
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,811
my wife has me
between a rock and a hard place.

273
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,040
That's her job.
You should respect that.

274
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,982
When I first met Marylin,
we were crazy about each other.

275
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,987
Not emotionally, of course.
Just, we couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

276
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,149
But then...
then...

277
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,526
Time marches on.

278
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,154
- Ardor cools.
- Yeah.

279
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,064
So, um, we had an understanding;

280
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,103
Whereby?
We could see other people.

281
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:42,733
Has Mrs. Rexroth pursued the opportunities
implicit in your arrangement?

282
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,107
Uh, I can... I can only assume...

283
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,203
Not in court, you can't.

284
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,306
- Has she retained counsel?
- I don't know.

285
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,250
- She has rottweilers.
- Not a good sign.

286
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,949
And have you yourself exploited
your understood freedom?

287
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,890
There's a lady.

288
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,894
A-Ayoung lady.

289
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,089
She lets me be myself.
Of course;

290
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:09,396
And your wife is aware
and/or has evidence?

291
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,404
- Video.
- Hah!

292
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,134
To cut to the chase,
forensically speaking,

293
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,199
is there a prenup?

294
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:27,119
"The fault, dear Brutus, lies not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

295
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,883
Let me ask you this...
What kind of a settlement do you seek?

296
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,188
What are, for you,
the parameters of the possible?

297
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,194
Well, that's the problem.

298
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,287
I can't afford to give her anything.

299
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,069
Nothing?

300
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,072
Yeah, I know that sounds
a little rough, but listen,

301
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,075
I'm about to close a deal
to develop some mini-malls;

302
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,077
I'm mortgaged up to my heinie.

303
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,670
If this deal goes south, I am ruined.
I will lose millions.

304
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,181
So you propose...

305
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,879
that, in spite of demonstrable
infidelity on your part,

306
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:04,445
your unoffending wife should be
tossed out on her ear?

307
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:08,255
Well, is that possible?

308
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,831
It's a challenge.

309
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,470
Why don't you come out to Malibu
and see my new beach house tomorrow.

310
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,972
I didn't know Dmitri
had a beach house.

311
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,975
Neither did I
until my lawyer found it.
Quite a paper trail.

312
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,011
He had it
in the dog's name.
Oh.

313
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,546
Well, tomorrow won't work;
I'm having a body wrap;

314
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,548
How's Wednesday?
Hair appointment
in the morning;

315
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,141
Afternoon?
Shrink.
How's your Thursday?

316
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,154
I'm having facial injections.
That kills Friday and Saturday.

317
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,713
- Botox?
- Butt fat.

318
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,351
Does that really work?
You tell me.

319
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,895
Hello, darlings.
Mwah!

320
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,897
Mwah!

321
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,456
So, you and Rex are...

322
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:53,130
Well, as my private investigator put it,
we're gonna nail his ass.

323
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:57,506
I've been trying
to nail George's ass for years,
but he is so careful.

324
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:01,308
- [Coughing]
- Oh;! Oh;!

325
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,143
Are you all right, Claire?

326
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,377
Down the wrong pipe.

327
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,386
- So, who's your lawyer?
- Freddy Bender.

328
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,890
I have an appointment this afternoon
with Rex and his schnauzer.

329
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,392
So, who's Rex's guy?
Miles Massey.

330
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,520
Miles Massey?
Of Massey, Myerson?

331
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,531
Do you know him?
By reputation.

332
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,261
And, Marylin, he's no schnauzer.

333
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,270
He got Phyllis Rumsey
that cute little island
of George's.

334
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:28,273
George was so impressed,
he hired him
when he divorced his second.

335
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,866
- Muriel Rumsey.
- Who's she?

336
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,912
Now?
Night manager at McDonald's.

337
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,041
But, Marylin,
do we have a man for you;

338
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,051
Thorstenson Gieselensen.

339
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,679
He just separated from his third.
He's in fish.

340
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,689
He is fish.
Well, he's tuna.

341
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,124
Ladies, I'm not seeing anyone
until I've finished nailing Rex's ass.

342
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,754
But, Marylin,
this man is tuna;

343
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,231
Sarah, one husband at a time.

344
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,702
I'll do the talking.

345
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,969
I know you'll be tempted to chime in,
but remember that you're in
an emotionally vulnerable state.

346
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,306
I'm the professional;
Oh;

347
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:06,743
Okay.

348
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,645
Freddy.

349
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,813
Freddy Bender,
this is Rex Rexroth.

350
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,820
And you are
the lovely Marylin;

351
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,822
Please, Ms. Rexroth.

352
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,915
And you must be Mr. Massey.

353
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,926
Please, Miles. Sit.

354
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,588
Sit down.

355
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:28,361
Freddy, I was sorry to hear
about the Goldberger award.

356
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,096
- Pastry?

357
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,104
We did very well.

358
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,163
We did very well.

359
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,176
Not to worry, Mrs. Rexroth.
You're ably represented.

360
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:41,236
I'm sure Freddy's just too modest
to tell you he used to clerk
for Clarence Thomas.

361
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,248
Pastry?
Going begging.

362
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,807
Don't try to bait me, Miles.

363
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,319
If you have a proposal to make,
let's hear it.

364
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,982
Well, at this point
my client is still prepared
to consider reconciliation.

365
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,860
My client's ruled that out.

366
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,921
My client is prepared to entertain
an amicable dissolution to the marriage
without prejudice.

367
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,933
That's a fart in a stiff wind.

368
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,935
My client proposes
a 30-day cooling-off period.

369
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,801
My client feels
sufficiently dispassionate.

370
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,205
My client asks that you not
initiate proceedings pending
his setting certain affairs in order.

371
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,107

372
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,313
What's so goddamn funny?

373
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,315
Please, let me handle this.

374
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:21,444
All right,
so much for the ice-breakers.
What are you after, Freddy?

375
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,216
My client is prepared to settle
for 50 percent of the marital assets.

376
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:29,826
Why only 50, Freddy?
Why not a hundred?

377
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,659
While we're dreaming,
why not 150?

378
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,700
- Are you familiar with Kershner?
- Kershner does not apply.

379
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,701
Bring this to trial,
we'll see if Kershner applies.

380
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,532
What's Kershner?
Please, let me handle this.

381
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,004
- Kershner was in Kentucky.
- Kershner was in Kentucky?

382
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,839
- Kershner was in Kentucky.
- All right, Freddy, forget Kershner;
What's your bottom line?

383
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,037
Primary residence,
30 percent of remaining assets.

384
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,911
What, are you nuts?
Have you forgotten Kershner?

385
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,811
Freddy, it's a negotiation;

386
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,820
See you at the preliminary;

387
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,981
Freddy,
we're all friends here;

388
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,254
It's a negotiation. Hey, uh...

389
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,192
Freddy!

390
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,197
Fine. We'll eat the pastry.

391
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,941
I thought that went well.

392
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,944
Don't cry out loud

393
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,946
Oh, yeah;

394
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,948
Gus, you outdid yourself;

395
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,950
Mm-hmm;
Hear, hear;

396
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,952
Mm-hmm, that's cool;
Very cool;

397
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,352
Let's go back
to the football game;!

398
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,859
Oh, kiss my ass, now.
It's halftime, man.
This is some good shit.

399
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,860
I'm 'bout to nail his ass
right here.

400
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,863
Gussy, go back to
the Rabinowitz tape again.

401
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,162
Hold on, now.
Here come the good part.
She 'bout to take off her panties.

402
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,169
Oh, yeah.
Come on, come on, come on.

403
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,171
Gus?
Mm-hmm... Yeah?

404
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,673
It's Miles Massey;
Uh, take a number.

405
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,676
It's about
a job tonight;!

406
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,678
Goddamn it.

407
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:56,271
Aah! Aah!
Did you see that?
Oh, come on, man!

408
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,964
Here we are;

409
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,569
Ms. Rexroth, I am so delighted
you decided to come.

410
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,571
Well, I must admit
I was curious.

411
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,370
Something to start?
Some wine, perhaps?

412
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,240
Red?
French?

413
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,678
Bordeaux?
Chateau Margaux?

414
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,716
'57?
'59.

415
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,410
'54.

416
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,249
Mmm, Mr. Massey.
Good, sir;

417
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:39,690
Your husband had told me
you were the most beautiful woman
that he'd ever met.

418
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,253
I didn't expect
the most beautiful woman
I'd ever met.

419
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:48,624
"Dismiss your vows,
your feigned tears, your flattery,

420
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,693
for where a heart is hard
they make no battery."

421
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:58,338
"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

422
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,004
Now, you didn't ask me here
to pick me up.

423
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,014
You could be disbarred for that.

424
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:05,448
Maybe I'm reckless.

425
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,385
What was your performance about
this afternoon?
What did your lawyer say?

426
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,388
Oh, Freddy thinks you're a buffoon.

427
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:13,016
He says
you've been too successful,

428
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,823
you're bored, complacent,
and you're on your way down.

429
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,955
But you don't think so.
How do you know?

430
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,022
Why would you be here?
Why did you ask me?

431
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,567
Can't I be curious?
About what?

432
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:24,569
Do you ever
answer questions?
Do you?

433
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:27,572
I'll have the tournedoes of beef.
The lady will have the same.
Thank you.

434
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,505
Thank you, sir.

435
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,509
I assume you're a carnivore.

436
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:35,138
Oh, Mr. Massey, you have no idea.

437
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,705
Miles, please.

438
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,717
Tell me more about yourself.

439
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:42,720
All right, Miles.

440
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,723
Let me tell you
everything that you need to know.

441
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:49,488
You may think you're tough,
but I eat men like you for breakfast.

442
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,395
I've invested five good years
in my marriage to Rex,

443
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,399
and I've nailed his ass
fair and square.

444
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,061
Now I'm going to have it
stuffed, mounted...

445
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:01,004
and have my lady friends come over
and throw darts at it.

446
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,563
Man-hater, huh?

447
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,705
People don't go on safaris
'cause they hate animals.

448
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,714
So it's just for the hunt,
with the trophy at the end;

449
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,376
No. Nothing so frivolous.

450
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,784
This divorce means money.

451
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,790
Money means independence.

452
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,452
That's what I'm after.

453
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,722
What are you after, Miles?

454
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:25,730
Well, I'm a lot like you.

455
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,959
Just looking for
an ass to mount.

456
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,560
Well, don't look at mine.

457
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,911

458
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,915

459
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,543
Yeah.

460
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,878

461
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,321
Oy vey;

462
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,820

463
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,831

464
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,273
I got ya. See this?

465
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,017

466
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,147

467
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,361
Yeah?

468
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,731
Uh, I'll just have
a, um, salad, please.

469
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:39,032
Um, baby field greens.

470
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,538
What did you call me?

471
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:46,067
Uh, no, l-l...
l-I didn't call you anything.

472
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:49,478
You want a salad?
Yeah. Do you... Do you have
a, uh, green salad?

473
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,880
What the fuck color
would it be?

474
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,885
Why are we eating here?

475
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,887
What's his problem?

476
00:30:55,955 --> 00:31:00,358
Just bring him an iceberg lettuce
and a mealy tomato wedge
smothered with French dressing.

477
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:06,126
- And for you?
- Ham sandwich on stale rye bread.
Lots of mayo, easy on the ham.

478
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,359
- Slaw cup?
- What the hell.

479
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,368
Hello, Marge.
How are you, Gus?

480
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,700
I'm all right.

481
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,298
Okay, now, I Minoxed
her address book.

482
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,310
Don't call me anymore
for this penny-ante shit.

483
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,903
I shoot action;
Me and the Ikegami, Jack;

484
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,915
Thank you, Gus.

485
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:26,417
And those rottweilers
were a menace, man.

486
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,419
I told you she had dogs.

487
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,217
Yeah. You ain't tell me
they had a hard-on for anus Africanus;

488
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,316
Gus, did you see any evidence,

489
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,327
any telltale signs...

490
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,421
of indiscretion
on the part of Mrs; Rexroth?

491
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,433
What are you talkin' 'bout,
"telltale signs"?

492
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,436
Look, I see an ass, I nail it.

493
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,597
I don't sneak around
sniffin' at sheets.

494
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,607
Goddamn it,
I'm Gus Petch!

495
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,109
Couldn't you
be disbarred for that?

496
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,112
No, I don't think so.
Maybe if I'd had the patty melt.

497
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,115
You had a guy break into her house
and photograph her address book.

498
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:01,050
No, Wrigley, I happened
to let a man know...

499
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,055
that I was interested
in her address book...
that's not criminal.

500
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,058
I also happened
to let him know that I was
taking her out to dinner.

501
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,060
That's not a crime either.

502
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:12,063
No, I don't see myself
as culpable in any sense.

503
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,066
You, on the other hand,
could be disbarred...

504
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:18,069
for developing
and examining these photos
of her address book,

505
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:21,072
but that doesn't
really concern me.

506
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,074
Right.

507
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,610
Who are you looking for?
Tenzing Norgay.

508
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,611
Tenzing Norgay.

509
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,647
That's someone she slept with.

510
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:34,118
I doubt it. Tenzing Norgay
was the Sherpa that helped
Edmund Hillary climb Mt. Everest.

511
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,279
And Marylin knows him.

512
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,984
No, you idiot.
Not the Tenzing Norgay.
Her Tenzing Norgay.

513
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,927
I'm not sure
that I actually follow that.

514
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,931
Few great accomplishments
are achieved single-handedly,
Wrigley.

515
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,933
Most have their Norgays.

516
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:52,459
Marylin Rexroth is even now
climbing her Everest.

517
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,472
I wanna find her Norgay.

518
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,065
But how do you determine
which of the people on here are...

519
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,736
How do you spot a Norgay?
Yeah.

520
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,643
You start with the people
with the funny names.

521
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:06,184
Oyez, oyez.
Family Court of the Fifth District
of Los Angeles County now in session.

522
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,776
The Honorable
Marva Munson presiding.
All rise.

523
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,262
Have you sat before her
before?

524
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,561
No. No, the judge sits first.
Then we sit.

525
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,567
Well, have you sat
after her before?

526
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,798
Sat after her before?
You mean, have we argued
before her before?

527
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:30,308
The judge sits in judgment.
The counsel argues before the judge.

528
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,673
So, have you argued
before her before?

529
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,009
Before her before,
or before she sat before?
Before her before;

530
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,675
I said, before her before.
No, you said
before she sat before.

531
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,684
I did at first, but...
Look, don't argue.

532
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,686
I'm not. I'm...
No, you don't argue.
We argue.

533
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,187
Counsel argues.
You appear.

534
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,190
Thejudge sits;
Then you sit;

535
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,192
- Or you stand in contempt;
- And then we argue.

536
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,319
The counsel argues.
Which you've done before.

537
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,329
Which we've done before.
Ah.

538
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,388
But not before her.

539
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,799
Rex. Sit.

540
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,739
There it is! I got it!

541
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,402
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
Enough, I say!

542
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,412
I'm gon' nail yo' ass! Yeah!

543
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,677
Yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
A silly misunderstanding...

544
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,684
Get that thing off me!

545
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,686
Yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass!

546
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:19,918
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
I'm gon' nail your ass;!

547
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,199
Devastated.

548
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,205
Simply devastated.

549
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,565
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

550
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,636
[Judge Munson]
Mr; Massey, any questions?

551
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,857

552
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,478
"Dismiss your vows,

553
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,480
"your feigned tears, your flattery,

554
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:19,449
for where a heart is hard
they make no battery;"

555
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,986
Mrs. Rexroth,
do you know those lines?
Objection, Your Honor.

556
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:26,047
- Grounds?
- Uh, poetry recitation.

557
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,252
Let me rephrase.
Mrs. Rexroth...

558
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:32,889
how high is that wall
around your heart?

559
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,899
Your Honor, this is harassment,

560
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,494
and, frankly,
it's still a little, uh, arty-farty.

561
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,505
- Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth,
have you ever been in love?
- Yes.

562
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,564
Of course.

563
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,476
With Rex.

564
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,480
And you've always loved him?

565
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,244
"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

566
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,784
S...

567
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,985
So it's your sworn testimony
that you have loved Rex Rexroth...

568
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,051
since first you met?

569
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,156
Yes.

570
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,636
Thank you.

571
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,638
No further questions,
Your Honor.

572
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,799
Who's next, Mr; Bender?

573
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,435
- We rest, Your Honor;
- Mr. Massey.

574
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:23,447
Your Honor, I call Heinz,
the Baron Krauss von Espy.

575
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,643
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy.

576
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,812
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy!

577
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,118
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy.

578
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,124
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy;!

579
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,853
Problem?
Puffy.

580
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,226
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy;!
Tenzing Norgay.

581
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:04,221
Mr. Krauss,
do you solemnly swear that...
Krauss von Espy.

582
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,814
Mr. Krauss von Espy,
do you solemnly...

583
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,655
Baron Krauss von Espy.

584
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,662
Solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give shall be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

585
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,163
so help you God?

586
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,256
- Mais bien s? R;
- No maybes.

587
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,700
Mais bien s? R;
But of course, yes.

588
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,500
The baron does not lie.
Have a seat, sir;

589
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,507
Did you sleep with him?

590
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,236
Don't be a fool.

591
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,279
Shush, Elsbieta.
Shush-shush-shush-shush.

592
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,281

593
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,045
Baron von Espy,
what is your profession?

594
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,848
Silly man. I am a baron.

595
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,856
Yes, but do you not
also hold a day job?

596
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,449
Paying job.
A, uh, a square job.

597
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,460
Well, one has to live.

598
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,463
I am the concierge
of Les Pantalons Rouges...

599
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,762
at Bad-Gadesbourg
in the canton of Uri.

600
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,700
And what does that job entail?

601
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,536
I satisfy such requests
as the clientele may present.

602
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,269
Towels, ice, et cetera?

603
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,208
We have bellmen for that.
No, no, no.

604
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,112
Such requests that, were you at home,
you would address not to your valet...

605
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,116
but to your majordomo.

606
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,776
Shush, poochy-chow.

607
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,980
I see. Baron, do you
recognize that woman?

608
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:13,491
Ah, cher Marylin;
But of course;

609
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,049
Look who is here. Hi!

610
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,062

611
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,157
And she was a guest
of the Red... Trousers?

612
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,794
Oh, many times,

613
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,805
for relaxing
and making Alpine recreation;

614
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,636

615
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,643
Mm-hmm. I am curious about
her visit of five years ago.

616
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,339
January 1998.

617
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,679
Can you remember
any specific request
she made at that time?

618
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,312
- Yes, I can.
- At what, at that time,
did she tell you she required?

619
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,357
She said that she required...

620
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,359
a husband!

621
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:50,793

622
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:54,354
Do you want some bones? Huh?
Does Elsbieta want some bones?

623
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,298
Has anyone any bones?

624
00:38:56,368 --> 00:39:00,168
Does anyone have any bones?
B... Uh, bones? Dog candies?

625
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:04,140
No, they are not candies. Milk-Bones.
Hard, crunchy bones for the teeth.

626
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,302
Uh, hard, uh...

627
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:09,506
We'll attend to the dog later;

628
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,446
Now, Baron...

629
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,643
Where were we?

630
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,688
"She said that
she required a husband.

631
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,691
"Oh, do you want some bones?

632
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,659
"Does Elsbieta want some bones?

633
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,127
Has anyone any bones?
Hard, crunchy bones for the..."

634
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,131
Right.

635
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,066
Now, a husband.
That's an unusual request.

636
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:33,070
Did she specify what kind
of a husband she was looking for?

637
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,072
Stop him.
Objection.

638
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,541
- Grounds?
- Uh... hearsay.

639
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,909
It's not secondhand, Your Honor.
This is direct testimony
about the baron's own conversation.

640
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,143
- I'm going to allow it.
- Yeah.

641
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,448
She said she wanted
a very rich husband.

642
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,719
She wanted to know
the businesses and the wealths-s...
the wealths-s-s...

643
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:59,059
Can I say this?
Wealths of our various eligible guests.

644
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,564
And did she have
any other specifications?

645
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,000
- Objection, Your Honor. Inflammatory.
- What's good for the gander, Your Honor.

646
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,506
- Is this a legal argument...
"What's good for the gander"?
- You got to play your tape, Freddy.

647
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,508
Mr; Massey has a point there;
I'm going to allow it;

648
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,067
Were there any other
specifications?

649
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,171
She "specificated" a silly man.

650
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,116
Objection, Your Honor;!
I'm going to allow it;

651
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,951
She "specificated" a man who,
though clever at making money,

652
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,115
would be easily duped
and controlled;

653
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:29,126
Objection, Your Honor.
Shut up, Freddy.
She's allowing it.

654
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:32,220
She "specificated"a man
with a wandering pee-pee;

655
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:36,791
How you say? Aphilanderer whose affairs
would be transparent to the world;

656
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,301
Objection, Your Honor!

657
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,704
Finally, a man whom
she could herself brazenly cuckold...

658
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,402
until such time
as she might choose to, uh...

659
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:48,412
We would say, "faire un coup
de marteau sur des fesses;"

660
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,074
You would say,
"make hammer on his fanny."

661
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,380
- Your Honor, Objection;! L-Irrelevant;!
- I'm going to allow it!

662
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,979
Tell us, Baron...
Did you introduce her to such a man?

663
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,614
Sir, I am the concierge!

664
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,717
And to whom did you introduce
that calculating woman?

665
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,160
I introduced her...

666
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,323
to that silly man.

667
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,060
Your Honor, objection;!

668
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,161
Let the record show that the baron
has identified Rex Rexroth as the silly man!

669
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,001
I did it;! It was l;!

670
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,803
I introduced her
to that silly man!

671
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:21,607
- You son of a bitch!
- The red-faced angry one.
I introduced them!

672
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,808
Absolument!
I did it;! It was l;!

673
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,817
I just love trains!

674
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:29,319
I love trains!
If you please, sir!

675
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:32,823
I'm not sick;!
You're the one who's sick;!

676
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:35,758
No... 
If you please...

677
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,295
Not the larynx!

678
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,194
Objection, Your Honor!
Strangling the witness!

679
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,096
I'm going to allow it.

680
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,533

681
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,534
Well, I think it stinks.

682
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,539
They left you with nothing.

683
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,542
Makes you wonder about
the entire legal system,

684
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,544
like Rodney what's-his-name.

685
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,046
They bought
Massey's argument.

686
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,049
If I lied or cheated
and was with Rex only for his money,

687
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,982
then he shouldn't have to
give me any.

688
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:04,215
Well, that makes no sense.
Why else would you put in
all those years?

689
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,223
Oooh!

690
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,725
Are you all right,
Sarah?

691
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,727
Yeah.
Wh-What is it?

692
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,729
Peptic ulcer.

693
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:17,860
I have medication,
but I can't take it
before elective surgery.

694
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:21,201
You shouldn't be
living here alone, Sarah.

695
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,570
My goddamn husbands
gave me the ulcer.

696
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:26,008
But a bottle of Bromo
can't love you back.

697
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,011
Yeah.

698
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,309
It's a catch-22.

699
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,545
I have to admit,
I don't like living alone.

700
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,552
I mean, do I need 46 rooms?

701
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,815
You could see people.

702
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,823
It's risky. Palimony.

703
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,826
Son of a bitch Marvin Mitchelson.

704
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,591
I'm telling you, honey, getting laid
is financial Russian roulette.

705
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,728
Maybe I shouldjust tear it all down,
build a cottage;

706
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,601
More landscaping.

707
00:42:56,508 --> 00:43:00,877
Well, with my money,
I can't afford to be fooling around.

708
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,879
Besides, I have you;

709
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,279
It'll be fun...
just the girls.

710
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,219
Well, thanks, Sarah, but I can't
sleep on your couch forever;

711
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,722
I'm going to marry again,

712
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,918
nail the guy's ass good.

713
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:19,553
And this time
there'll be no Puffy von Espy.

714
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,644
Knock knock.

715
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,646
Excuse me; Mr; Donaly?

716
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,648
Mr; Donaly?

717
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:40,116
Mr. Donaly, excuse me.

718
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,521
You are Donovan Donaly?

719
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,716
I'm in a meeting.
Mr; Donaly;

720
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,850
I need a name.

721
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:57,795
And, of course, we will have to litigate.
Sentence, paragraph.

722
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,661
Naturally, the first concern
for both parties...

723
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,504
is the welfare
of little WendellJunior.

724
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:08,672
Nevertheless, we do question
whether the continuing expenses
for his special ed classes...

725
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,181
are truly justified,
given the great strides...

726
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,241
Mr; Massey, the senior partner
would like to see you;

727
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,480
Herb wants to see me?
If you have a moment.

728
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,989

729
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,754
Fourteen summaryjudgments sought;

730
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,930
Thirteen granted;

731
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:02,193

732
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:06,499
Eighteen movements to void
for respondent's prejudice.

733
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,505
Eighteen granted;

734
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:11,940
Twelve court days
on the Rexroth case alone;

735
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,944

736
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:19,348
320 billable hours paralegal services.

737
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:23,720
680 billable; ; ;

738
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,722
at full attorney rate.

739
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,122

740
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,821
Eighty-five lunches charged;

741
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,829

742
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,058

743
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:42,933

744
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,874

745
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:52,013
Counselor; ; ;

746
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,318
you are the engine...

747
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,320
that drives this firm.

748
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,379

749
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,124
Mr. Massey?

750
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,133
Please, no calls.

751
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,135
I'm feeling... a little fragile.

752
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:16,139
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey,
but I felt certain you'd want to know
Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.

753
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:19,142
Marylin... Uh, uh, uh, w...
Uh, when did she, uh...

754
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,144
She's here now.

755
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:24,147
Is she armed?
Give me a minute.

756
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,910

757
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,027
Marylin.

758
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,529
How nice of you to...

759
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,531
Marylin?

760
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,863
Shame on you.

761
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,869
Marylin.

762
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,928
What a lovely surprise.

763
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,007
Marylin, what a pl...

764
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,442
- Who the hell are you?
- Hello, Miles.

765
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:57,242
So nice of you to see us.

766
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,484
May I introduce
Howard D. Doyle
of Doyle Oil.

767
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,487
I'm goddamn pleased
to meet you.

768
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,046
Marylin here,
she says you're the best.
Says you're aces.

769
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,821
Well, thank you, Mr., uh...

770
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:14,331
Uh, any... any relation
toJohn D. Doyle of Doyle Oil?

771
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,493
Oh, you must be talkin'
about Grandpa John.
My papa's John D. Too.

772
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,503
The Deuce, we called him.
You know, kinda the rebel
of the family.

773
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,665
But they knocked off
that wholeJohn D. Routine
when they christened Yours Truly.

774
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,732
Grandpa nearly had a stroke.

775
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,439
He did have a stroke,
but that was later,
during the labor activity in '52.

776
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,448
The government
stepped in.
Mm-hmm. Uh...

777
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,541
They called it mediation.
Well...

778
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,586
He called it
incipient communism.

779
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,587
Of course, that's when
he had his stroke.

780
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,590
Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog.

781
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:43,593
He lingered in a vegetative state
for years...
Well, that is fascinating, Mr. Doyle.

782
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,595
What say we have a seat?
A seat?

783
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,099
Marylin's had me runnin'
up and down Rodeo Drive all day long.

784
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,102
Kinda hit-and-run shoppin', you know.
Take no prisoners.

785
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,105
Forced march kind of thing.
My God, my dogs are barkin'.

786
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:58,108
We started out at this li'I ol' place
right off of Wilshire...
It's been quite a day.

787
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,041
Had pewter things.

788
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:04,912
But anyway, Miles, I know you're busy
and you charge by the hour,
so I'll get straight to the point.

789
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:08,748
Howard D. And I
are planning to marry.

790
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,557
Well...

791
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,083
Well, I suppose
that congratulations are in order.
Well, thank you, Miles;

792
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:23,395
You know, the urge to wedlock
and form a lastin'monogamous bond
sanctified by ritual, it's pert-near universal;

793
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:27,427
As a matter of fact,
it might be of some interest to you,
bein'in a related business...

794
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,440
Even your indigenous Americans...
Uh, I believe it was your Cree... used to...

795
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:34,444
Howard and I are here
because I've learned,
through bitter experience,

796
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:38,676
that when it comes
to matrimony and law,
you are the very best.

797
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,811
And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage; ; ;

798
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:46,288
ended in an unjustified stain...

799
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,291
upon my reputation.

800
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,293
My motives were impugned.

801
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:52,693
I was slandered in court.

802
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:55,460
I was painted a harlot;

803
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,467
Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot.

804
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,469
Oh, yes, honey.

805
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:03,974
So it's my desire to remove
any trace of suspicion; ; ;

806
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:07,603
from the mind
of my dear Howard Doyle.

807
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,612
Oh, honey, come on, now.

808
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,012
I wish to execute
a prenuptial agreement.

809
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:15,519
And I'm dead-set against it;
I mean, just anti the whole deal;

810
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:17,520
Howard's lawyers prefer it.

811
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,522
I insist upon it.

812
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,321
Oh, damn lawyers.
Uh, no offense to the present company
or anything, you know.

813
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:27,023
Now, is it my understanding
that the Massey prenup
has never been penetrated?

814
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,233
That is correct.

815
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,327
Not to blow my own horn,
but they devote an entire semester to it
at Harvard Law.

816
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:36,373
They got a hell of a school up there,
ain't no doubt about it;

817
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:39,376
We donated that Doyle building
up there here a while back.
Mm-hmm;

818
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:42,208
Now, I myself went to Texas A&M.
I'm an Aggie.

819
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,214
- Business?
- Tight end.

820
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:47,217
And I had a fair amount of success
against the split-T defense.

821
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,753
See, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

822
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:53,655
it allows me to buttonhook
and, you know, do a down-and-in,
up-and-out and different things...

823
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,817
post pattern
every now and then;

824
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:57,827
Your tight ends
don't generally run a post.

825
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,056
But if the QB calls it,
hell, I'm ready;

826
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,393
Interrupt for a second?
Yeah.

827
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:06,335
I wanna make sure
that you both understand...
what it is you're asking.

828
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:10,238
The Massey prenup
provides that in the event
of a dissolution of the marriage,

829
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,242
for any reason,

830
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,269
both parties will leave it
with what they brought in...
and earned during.

831
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,282
No one can profit
from the marriage.

832
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,547
The prenup protects
the wealthier party.

833
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:27,683
Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck;

834
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,693
Not a hell of a lot
of romance in that.

835
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,229
No, sir, there is not.
No romance.

836
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,891
More to the point,
no wriggle room.

837
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:39,368
So, are we sure; ; ;

838
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,395
that this is what we want?

839
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,941
Absolutely.

840
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,378
It's my gift to Howard,

841
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,142
for his peace of mind,

842
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,480
whether or not
he's worried about it
at this moment.

843
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,817
Oh, honey pie,
do I look worried?

844
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,693
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle.

845
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:06,696
Could I just borrow
your charming fianc e
for a moment?

846
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:09,198
Well, okay.
You gon' leave a deposit?

847
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:11,258

848
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,773
What are you up to?

849
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,777
Something
you won't understand, Miles.

850
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,279
Howard and I are very much in love.

851
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:27,681
I don't know what you're thinking,
but I have to warn you, the Massey prenup
has never been penetrated.

852
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:31,415
You sign the prenup,
you can't get his money.

853
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,457
Thanks for the professional help.

854
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:36,459
Marylin, think of me for a moment...

855
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,655
not as an attorney but as a friend.

856
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,665
Does that mean you won't be
charging us for the hour?

857
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,702
Dump him.
You can't nail his ass.

858
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,429
Is that all?

859
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,510
No, that's not all.

860
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,990

861
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,685
I could have you disbarred for that.

862
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,391
It was worth it.

863
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,895
A romantic divorce attorney.

864
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,741
You fascinate me.

865
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,740

866
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:37,919
I'll get right on it;
I'll whip something up;

867
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,481
All right. Thank you;

868
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,587
How's Lionel?
He's fine;

869
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:50,862
He asked me to deliver the keynote address
at this year's convention in Vegas.

870
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,493
That's quite an honor.

871
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,504
I suppose;
On top of a great victory.

872
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,039
What was that?

873
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:58,041
"What was that"?

874
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:00,043
Um, Rex Rexroth?

875
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:03,171
He kept everything?
You win? No compromise?
Isn't that what you wanted?

876
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,113

877
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,243
Oh, good God, Miles.
What are you looking for?

878
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,046
I don't know.

879
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,593
Okay, I won.

880
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,595

881
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,597
What then?

882
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:23,600
How many cases
has Herb Myerson won?

883
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,899
The old man?
More than anybody. He's a legend.
And look at him.

884
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:30,668
He's 87 years old,
he's the first one into the office
in the morning.

885
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:33,733
- No home life.
- Who needs a home
when you have a colostomy bag?

886
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:36,211
She can't really love this dope,
can she?

887
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,044
Who? Uh, who loves who?

888
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:41,050
Marylin Rexroth.

889
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:44,645
She signed a prenup
for an oil millionaire.

890
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:49,091
A... Massey... prenup?

891
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,929
Yeah.

892
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:55,488
Well, then she is not
after his money;

893
00:53:57,168 --> 00:54:01,104
Only love is in mind
if the Massey is signed.

894
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,072

895
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:09,010

896
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,081
April

897
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,144
Come she will

898
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:24,251
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain

899
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:28,924
Nay, she will stay

900
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,992
A-resting in my arms again

901
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,810
What the hell's
wrong with you?

902
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,614
April

903
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:51,678
Come she will

904
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,729
Thank you for coming
to this celebration...

905
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:03,563
of the love between our two friends,
Marylin and Howard.

906
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,068
In today's cynical world,

907
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:09,368
it's so hard to take
that great leap of faith...

908
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,341
aboard the ship of love and caring.

909
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,005
But today Marylin and Howard
are taking that leap...

910
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,412
and telling us, their friends,

911
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,349
that they do believe,
that they do have faith,

912
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:23,353
that they do love;

913
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,288
Do you, Howard Drexler Doyle,

914
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:30,316
take Marylin to be your shipmate
on this journey through life,

915
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:34,330
through gale and doldrum,
seas choppy, wild and calm?

916
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,332
Yes, I do, Father Scott.

917
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,334

918
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:41,667
And do you, Marylin Rexroth,
take Howard to be
your shipmate and companion...

919
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,673
to ports of every clime,

920
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:46,608
Be it in first class or steerage?

921
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,838
I do.

922
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:51,746
Then, by the power vested in me
by the State of California,

923
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:54,546
and as captain
of the good ship Amore Veritas,

924
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:57,781
I now pronounce you man and wife.

925
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:18,765
What do you think?

926
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:23,069
- What are they, ladles?
- Berry spoons.

927
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:25,081
Spoons?
Berry spoons.

928
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:28,084
Everybody has spoons.
And nobody needs
berry spoons.

929
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,313
Everybody eats berries.
Who are you, Pollyanna?

930
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,288
Hey, everybody!
Folks! Hey, y'all!
Where'd you see 'em at?

931
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:36,292
A Martha Stewart catalog
right next to the silver napkin rings?

932
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,794
I need your attention
for a minute;
Stadium seat ass-warmers?

933
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:41,127
Dear God, Wrigley, how many
cockamamie personal possessions
do we have to amass...

934
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,132
Why so angry?

935
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,660
Now, I know it's not common practice
for the groom to give his bride
a gift on their weddin' day,

936
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,571
but ever since
I met Marylin there; ; ;

937
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,666
I can't seem to quit
givin' her things.

938
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,303

939
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:58,906
- And I don't wanna stop
'cause it feels so durn good!

940
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,850
Chow Sing, bring that barbecue sauce
over here, little buddy;

941
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,853
There you go.

942
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,651
Put that thing on my neck now.

943
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:08,749
Now, honey,
it's like the padre said.

944
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:10,760
I want love and trust between us.

945
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,490
Love and trust
and not a thing else;

946
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,556
And this here deed
that I'm fixin' to perform...

947
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,761
Well, honey, let me just, uh...

948
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,066
You see this?

949
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,384

950
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,545
This is for you, darlin;

951
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,488
This here is for you.

952
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,492
This here is for you, baby.

953
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,620
Ever'last little speck of it;

954
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,630
I love you.

955
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:50,462
I mean, I love you
like a son of a bitch!

956
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,196
I trust you;!

957
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:57,866
This here is for you, baby;
Brilliant!

958
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,500
Baby, this is for you.

959
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,442
What is it?
I really love you;

960
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,174
It's the prenup.

961
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,840
I love her!

962
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:08,544
I trust her;!

963
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,553
Ladies and gentlemen,
It's the prenup!

964
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,885
I trust her;!
Brilliant!

965
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,327
You look beautiful.

966
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:21,330
Ladies,
if you'll excuse us.

967
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,593
We have to talk.

968
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,101
I would like to offer
my congratulations;

969
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,105
It was a beautiful gesture
of Howard's.

970
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,767
Well, Howard
is a beautiful person.

971
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,776
A diamond in the rough.

972
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,108
And I have a feeling that
someday soon...

973
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,115
you'll be taking that diamond
and leaving the rough.

974
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:43,586
In a month or so,
once I've established that I've tried
to make the marriage work.

975
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:47,055
May I offer my services?
Oh, thanks.

976
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,058
But no.

977
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,060
No, I'm retaining Freddy Bender.

978
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:53,688
Poor Freddy. He was awfully blue
after my last divorce.

979
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,698
Well, I admire your loyalty.

980
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:57,700
To lawyers, anyway.

981
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:00,965
I guess without the prenup
it's something even Freddy could manage.

982
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,973
But how did you
get Howard to do it?

983
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,975
It felt like it was his idea.

984
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,978
Surely, Mr. Massey,
you've addressed enough juries...

985
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,913
to appreciate
the power of suggestion.

986
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,280
Mmm.

987
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,286
Wish I was a Kellogg's Corn Flake

988
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,414
Look, now that the marriage
is winding down,

989
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:22,482
have dinner with me.

990
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,795
No.

991
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:29,299
No, nothing doing until
the ink is dry on the settlement.

992
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,834
Oh, this'll be no settlement.

993
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:36,168
If I know Marylin Rexroth,
this'll be nothing short of
a complete and total...

994
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,565
annihilation.

995
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:00,789
You're gonna win.
Excuse me?

996
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:04,425
I can always tell,
going to Vegas,
who's gonna win.

997
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:08,335
Well, thanks,
but I'm going on business.

998
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:11,272
I always win.

999
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:19,771
Yeah

1000
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,943
Yeah

1001
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:27,456
You know why I hate this town,
Wrigley?

1002
01:00:27,524 --> 01:00:32,393
You see, people get to Las Vegas,
and all of a sudden, the rules
of the moral universe don't apply.

1003
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,897
When God is dead,
all things are possible.

1004
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,899
I saw an ad in the paper:

1005
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:41,836
"No-fault divorce...
two-week divorce without a lawyer."

1006
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:45,272
Made me sick to my stomach.
"No-fault divorce."

1007
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:48,641
Good God.
Talk about your oxymoron.

1008
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:51,681
What's the world comin' to?
One man
can only do so much.

1009
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:54,582
One man... What
are you talkin' about?

1010
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,711
- Freddy.
- I had lunch
with Freddy Bender yesterday;

1011
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:01,155
He tells me
that Marylin Rexroth-Doyle
is now richer than Croesus.

1012
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:04,820
Ah, yes, but is she richer
than Mrs. Croesus?

1013
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,659
She could buy and sell you
10 times over.
She...

1014
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:12,630
- My God, is that her?
- Mmm.

1015
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:16,366
Freddy said she was flying in with him.
Celebrating, I guess.

1016
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,103
I'm fascinated by that creature.
Richer than me, huh?

1017
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,805
Well, she deserves every penny;

1018
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,180
And now she's single again;
Excuse me;

1019
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,947
No. You should stay away
from her, Miles.

1020
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,284
Recite your keynote address.
Take a cold shower.

1021
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,893
You're looking well,
Marylin.
Hello, Miles.

1022
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:46,902
Obscene wealth becomes you.

1023
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,770
I should've known
you'd be here.
Be here?

1024
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:53,776
I'm the keynote speaker.
Oh, how nice for you.

1025
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:57,007
"Nailing Your Spouse's Assets."
Excuse me?

1026
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,607
My speech.
Oh!

1027
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:03,744
Oh, I'm sure you'll
bring the house down.

1028
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:05,755
It's an easy crowd.

1029
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:10,726
At this point, I would think
you're probably the only person
that I can't teach anything to.

1030
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:12,819
Really?
Mmm.

1031
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:17,230
Now, correct me,
but since by now the ink must be dry,

1032
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,929
I believe
I have the right to collect.

1033
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:24,167
On?
You promised to have dinner with me
once you were free.

1034
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:28,234
I said I wouldn't whilst I wasn't,
which implies no promise once I am.

1035
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,872
Noted.
Let me rephrase.

1036
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:35,408
I would be delighted...
honored, really...
if you'd... 

1037
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,009

1038
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,248
Howard!
Ow! Howard!

1039
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,814
Howard!

1040
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:45,953
You named him
after your ex.
I'm sentimental.

1041
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:51,797
Well, I'm free this evening,
so I suppose a little dinner
would do no harm.

1042
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:55,327
Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,
1990, sir;

1043
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:59,865
Yes. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

1044
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:04,211
Marylin, this is
a moment to savor.

1045
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,375
Yes, we were adversaries,

1046
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,682
but we were also professionals.

1047
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:16,090
So let us raise a glass
to friendship.

1048
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,154
To victory.

1049
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:28,295
So, how does it feel?

1050
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:32,501
Sorry?
Victory. Independence.

1051
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:35,136
Oh, um...

1052
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,547
- Well, frankly, Miles...
- It's not everything you'd hoped for?

1053
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,382
I know the feeling.

1054
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:52,519
Independence.
Two-edged sword.

1055
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,597
My friend... My best friend...
Sarah Sorkin?

1056
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:01,260
Sarah Battista-O'Flanagan-Sorkin?

1057
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:04,068
The O'Flanagan settlement?

1058
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:08,535
- Ahh.
- Hmm.

1059
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:12,810
- Huh.
- Anyway, three fine settlements.

1060
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:15,181
More money
than she could ever hope to spend.

1061
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,618
Yes.
Her vaunted independence;

1062
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:23,024
Don't tell me. She sits
around the house, afraid to see people,
afraid to put her portfolio into play.

1063
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:27,427
And only a peptic ulcer
to keep her warm at night.

1064
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,488
Yes.

1065
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:34,435
There's a certain point
when you've achieved your goals.

1066
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,531
You realize that
you're still not satisfied.

1067
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,599
Yes.

1068
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,941
We should order.

1069
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:54,654
You know,
I'm not really hungry.

1070
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,885
Neither am I.

1071
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:23,353
Shh.

1072
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,426

1073
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:44,167
1,800 billable hours;

1074
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:49,770
1,221 motions to void;

1075
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:55,409
564 summary judgments.

1076
01:05:55,485 --> 01:06:01,321
129,999 lunches charged.

1077
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,723

1078
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:08,292

1079
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:11,095

1080
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,804

1081
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:20,604
Hello?

1082
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:25,705
Miles?
Hello? Marylin?

1083
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:28,012
Sarah Sorkin just died!

1084
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,347
Marylin!

1085
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,413
Her ulcer...

1086
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:37,985
perforated.

1087
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:41,326
Infection.
Yes.

1088
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:46,567
Miles?
Yes, Marylin?

1089
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,968
She was alone.

1090
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,136
She'd been dead for two days
before her Pilates instructor found her.

1091
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,174
Marylin, listen to me.

1092
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:03,515
No arguments. No discussions.
I'll have Wrigley meet us
at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather.

1093
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:07,352
[Tires Screeching]

1094
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:12,289
- Wrigley!
- The vows are from an Arapaho
dawn greeting ceremony.

1095
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:16,560
The music is Simon and Garfunkel.
And this is the Massey prenup.

1096
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:21,036
You the two gettin' married?
- Mr. MacKinnon here will be officiating.

1097
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,538
Sorry. Short notice.
Pen.

1098
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:27,043
Marylin, you're welcome
to examine this.

1099
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:30,978
This is the Massey prenup.

1100
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,039
As you know, it's ironclad.
We tried to reach Freddy Bender.

1101
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:37,609
We tried to reach Freddy, to have him here
for your protection, but we couldn't find him.
I couldn't get him.

1102
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:40,315
Are you two here to get married
or to bullshit?

1103
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,793
- So you can't hope to benefit
from the marriage?
- Not in any way.

1104
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:48,228
And my wealth is completely...
completely protected?

1105
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:51,495
As if a lead veil
had been drawn across it.

1106
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,773

1107
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:03,442
Do you still
want to marry me?
More than ever.

1108
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,504

1109
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,149
Are ya rentin' kilts?

1110
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:12,279

1111
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,561

1112
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:29,833
Do you, Miles Longfellow Massey,

1113
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:34,275
of Massey, Myerson, Sloan
and Gurolnick, L.L.P.,

1114
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:39,475
take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1115
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:41,813
I do. Yes. I do. I do.

1116
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:46,219
Let me finish.
Jesus, have you never
been married before?

1117
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:51,955
To have and to hold,
to love and to cherish,
till death do you part?

1118
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:56,357
- I do.

1119
01:08:56,433 --> 01:09:00,392
And do you,
Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle,

1120
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:05,032
take Miles Longfellow Massey
to be your lawful wedded husband,

1121
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:09,306
to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish,
till death do you part?

1122
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:13,748
- I do.
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

1123
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:17,412

1124
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,184

1125
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,664

1126
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:48,814
I'll take care of you later;

1127
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,876

1128
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,695
No, no, no, no, no. No.
This is all wrong.
Wha...

1129
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:06,765
Is it the kilt?

1130
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:12,240
Do you love me?
More than anything.

1131
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:16,609
Can I trust you?
Yes. You can trust me.

1132
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:27,316
Darling, you're exposed.

1133
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,824
A sitting duck.

1134
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:51,576
I hereby declare the 12th Congress
of the National Organization...

1135
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:55,744
- of Matrimonial Attorneys
Nationwide... open.

1136
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:01,451
As our first order of business,
it is a privilege to call to the podium
our keynote speaker.

1137
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:06,359
From the Los Angeles firm
of Massey, Myerson, Sloan and Gurolnick,

1138
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:11,196
a man whose name is synonymous
with bitter disputes and big awards,

1139
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,258
Miles Massey.

1140
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,180
Thank you, Branco.

1141
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:36,215

1142
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,152
In the world of...

1143
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:47,199
In the world of matrimonial law,
there are...

1144
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:50,872
[Person Coughs]

1145
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:59,514
In the world of matrimonial law,
there are multiple tactics... 

1146
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,814

1147
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:15,420

1148
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,489
Friends,

1149
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:23,128
this morning I stand before you
a very different Miles Massey...

1150
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:25,868
than the one that
addressed you last year...

1151
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:29,241
on the disposition of marital assets
following murder/suicide.

1152
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:33,874
I wish to talk to you today
not about technical matters oflaw;

1153
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,388
I wish to talk to you
about something more important.

1154
01:12:41,624 --> 01:12:44,616
I wish to talk to you
from the heart...

1155
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:55,536
because today...
for the first time in my life,

1156
01:12:55,605 --> 01:13:00,008
I stand before you... naked...

1157
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:06,072
vulnerable...

1158
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:12,111
And in love.

1159
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:14,713

1160
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:20,725
Love.

1161
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,966
It's a word
we matrimonial lawyers avoid.

1162
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:29,700
Funny, isn't it?
We're frightened of this emotion,
which is, in a sense,

1163
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,763
the seed of our livelihood.

1164
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:36,403
Well, today Miles Massey
is here to tell you...

1165
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:40,575
that love need
cause us no fear.

1166
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,954
Love need cause us no shame.

1167
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:48,217
Love is...

1168
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,282
good.

1169
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:59,824
- Love is good.

1170
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:07,772
I am, of course, aware that these remarks
will be received here with cynicism.

1171
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:12,543
Cynicism, that cloak
that advertises our indifference; ; ;

1172
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,674
and hides all human feeling.

1173
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:18,209
Well, I'm here to tell you that that cynicism
which we think protects us; ; ;

1174
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:21,018
in fact destroys.

1175
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,423
Destroys love,
destroys our clients,

1176
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:27,361
and, ultimately,
destroys ourselves.

1177
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:32,629
Colleagues, when our clients come to us
confused and angry and hurting; ; ;

1178
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:36,297
because their flame of love
is guttering and threatens to die,

1179
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:39,466
do we seek to extinguish that flame
so that we can sift...

1180
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:42,477
through the smoldering wreckage
for our paltry reward,

1181
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:45,514
or do we fan
this precious flame,

1182
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:50,383
this most precious flame,
back into loving, roaring life?

1183
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:54,480
Do we counsel fear or trust?

1184
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,889
Do we seek to destroy or build?

1185
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,488
Do we meet our clients'problems
with cynicism; ; ;

1186
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,856
or with love?

1187
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,967
The choice is, of course,
each of ours.

1188
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:20,115
For my part, I've made the leap of love,
and there's no going back.

1189
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:23,448
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the last time I will address you; ; ;

1190
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,511
as the president of N.O.M.A. N...
or as a member.

1191
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:28,955

1192
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:33,928
I intend to devote myself
to pro bono work in East Los Angeles; ; ;

1193
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:36,363
or... one of those other...

1194
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:43,595
God bless you all.

1195
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:16,870

1196
01:16:23,513 --> 01:16:26,448

1197
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:35,156
I love you, man.

1198
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:52,499
So, Wrigley, I'm gonna be
relinquishing my partnership
in Massey, Myerson.

1199
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:56,875
If you'd care to join me
in my new endeavor,
I'd be delighted.

1200
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:00,109
Of course, I can't offer you
the same kind of financial remuneration
you've grown accustomed to,

1201
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:02,117
but the work'll have
to serve as its own reward.

1202
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:05,780
Barkeep, we'll have two
of your finest scotches.
That's the, uh...

1203
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:10,792
- I propose a toast; Barkeep;!
- That's... That's the soap that used
to belong to, uh...

1204
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,761
Now, you'll be serving
in a junior capacity, of course.
Donovan Donaly.

1205
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:18,460
- Miles, that's, uh... that's, uh... uh...
- It'll be a small operation, a boutique.

1206
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:21,025
Let me tell you
what they called me
in medical school.

1207
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:24,505
The...
I don't see why
my leadership skills should...

1208
01:17:24,574 --> 01:17:27,065
Howard?
Mackenzie the Mechanical Marvel.

1209
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,077
It's Howard;
You see, I have no nerves.

1210
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,808
He's not an oil tycoon.
An actor.

1211
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:36,340
Doctor, this is highly unusual.

1212
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:40,014
So Marylin married a soap actor.

1213
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:44,389
So she's... she's; ; ; poor;

1214
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:48,191
Get yourself some clean scrubs
and have them prepare the O.R.

1215
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:51,062
- Well, thank God you have the prenup.
- I have no prenup.

1216
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:53,694
- You have no prenup.
- I have no prenup.

1217
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,397
You have no prenup.

1218
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:08,042
Thanks.

1219
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,108
Okay.

1220
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:18,621
- Marylin?
- Oh, hello, Miles.

1221
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,889

1222
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:26,766
- Going back to L.A.?
- Yes.

1223
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:30,863
Look, Miles, I think it's only fair
to warn you that after a decent interval,

1224
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,465
I intend to have Freddy
seek an injunction...

1225
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:36,706
that would forbid you to approach
within 500 feet of my house.

1226
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:41,273
You mean, my house.
Oh, I believe the residence
will be part of the settlement.

1227
01:18:44,654 --> 01:18:49,489
Marylin, didn't last night
mean anything to you?

1228
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:53,996
Oh; Well, about as much as
it'll mean to you...
half of your net worth;

1229
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:59,365
Oh, Miles, you'll always be
my favorite husband.

1230
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,495
But no more sentiment,
darling.

1231
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,666
I really have to be going.

1232
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,732
The dog's rented.

1233
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,801

1234
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:18,920
You didn't win.

1235
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,922
Excuse me?

1236
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:25,791
I can always tell,
comin' back from Vegas,
who didn't win.

1237
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:30,597
You're right.

1238
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,701

1239
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:35,768
But; ; ;

1240
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,940
you're going
through with it?

1241
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:41,806
Yes.

1242
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:45,439
I just felt so sorry for him
for a minute there.

1243
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:48,813
At the preliminary hearing,
he just looked so beaten.

1244
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,820
Well, he was beaten,
fair and square.
I know, but...

1245
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:53,856
Oh, their pathetic look.

1246
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:57,256
It's what they all fall back on
when they don't have a prenup.

1247
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:00,995

1248
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:04,226
Just stay strong
until the divorce is final.

1249
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,532
Relax...
and enjoy your pool.

1250
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,800
Do you think
he's eating enough?
Marylin!

1251
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:21,038
This woman has humbled,

1252
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:25,918
Shamed and disgraced
the entire firm.

1253
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:29,515
- Yes, Herb.
- Counselor; ; ;

1254
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:33,653
this firm deals in power.

1255
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:36,289
This firm deals in perception.

1256
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:40,162
This firm cannot prosper...

1257
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:45,936
nor long endure
if it is perceived to be; ; ;

1258
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:49,500
dancing to the music
of a hurdy-gurdy!

1259
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,637
It's just...

1260
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:56,646
Herb, for the first time
in my career,

1261
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,847
I don't know what to do.

1262
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:04,416
I'm a patsy.
I'm a sittin' duck. I'm lost.

1263
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:06,961
- Lost?

1264
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:11,363
I'll tell you what you can do.
You can act like a man.

1265
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:14,130
And let me
tell you something, smart guy.

1266
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,694
You thought you had it
all figured out;

1267
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:19,434
Trust. Marriage.

1268
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:23,103
All your goddamn love, love, love!

1269
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:29,049
Now, you listen to me;
I'm gonna talk to you
about the goddamn law;

1270
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,177
We serve the law!

1271
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,881
We honor the law!

1272
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:38,393
And sometimes, Counselor,
we obey the law;

1273
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:42,363
But, Counselor,

1274
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:45,161
This is not one of those times.

1275
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,964

1276
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:59,477
Are you... WheezyJoe?

1277
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:01,812
Which of youse is Smith?

1278
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:05,980
Well, uh, we're here
representing Mr. Smith...

1279
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:08,353
on a matter of some delicacy.

1280
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,325
- Who's the pigeon?
- The what?

1281
01:22:11,394 --> 01:22:14,591
- Who you want me to kill?
- Yes. Well, we would like you...

1282
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,997
Mr. Smith would like you
to neutralize...

1283
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:22,868
terminate...
render unto a state of...

1284
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,702
so that
she isn't so much, uh... uh...

1285
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:28,972
- Breathing.
- Yes. A business associate...

1286
01:22:29,045 --> 01:22:33,846
by the name of
Marylin Rexroth-Doyle-Massey...
Smith... Massey.

1287
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,783
Is that one person?

1288
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:40,652
I have some photos here...

1289
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:44,853
of Miss Rexroth,
and, um, that's the address
that she's staying at.

1290
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:48,294
That is Mr. Smith's address...
Massey's... Smith...

1291
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:51,333
It's Mr. Smith's address,
although Mr. Smith is not
directly involved.

1292
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,598
Because of an impending legal matter,
we need this to happen
within a certain time frame;

1293
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:58,970
- On an expedited basis.
- You're in a rush.

1294
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,373
We're not in a rush.
Mr. Smith is.

1295
01:23:04,914 --> 01:23:07,678

1296
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:14,480
Sh... Sh... Sh... She won't...
She won't suffer, will she?

1297
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:17,559
Not unless you pay extra.

1298
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:22,229
Oh, I've been workin'
on the railroad

1299
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:25,165
All the livelong day

1300
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:27,702
I've been workin' on the railroad

1301
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,534
Just to pass the time away

1302
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:34,064
Can't you hear the whistle blowing

1303
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:37,738
Rise up so early in the morn
[Women] Toot-toot!

1304
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:40,008

1305
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:44,280
Whistle's goin' "toot-toot."

1306
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:51,054
What's the matter, Rexie?

1307
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:55,624

1308
01:23:58,501 --> 01:24:00,969
Hello?

1309
01:24:02,071 --> 01:24:05,268
Yes, he's here.
One moment, please.

1310
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:20,647
Miles.

1311
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:23,123
It's for you.

1312
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:34,228
Hello? Yes?

1313
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,301
What?

1314
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,146
I see;

1315
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:50,685
My God.

1316
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:54,348
- What?
- That was Marvin Untermeyer.

1317
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:57,517
He was Rex Rexroth's
personal attorney;

1318
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,527
Yes?

1319
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,460
What do you mean, he was?

1320
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:06,297
Rex had a massive coronary
in the middle of a business meeting.

1321
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:08,302
He's dead.

1322
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,770
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that,

1323
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:13,672
but you two weren't... close,
were you?

1324
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:18,873
Marvin said that Rex's will
was four years old.
Never redrafted it.

1325
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:22,179
He was stinkin'rich;
Yes?

1326
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:26,678
Everything goes to Marylin.

1327
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:35,689
She's not poor.
She's richer than you.

1328
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:38,756
She is exposed. No prenup.
She's a sitting duck.

1329
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:41,132
She's a sitting duck.
Can't kill her. No need.
Mm-hmm.

1330
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:43,899
No. It would be pointless.
She's exposed.
It's pointless.

1331
01:25:43,973 --> 01:25:46,441
Exposed.
Why kill the only woman
you've ever loved when
she's the richer party?

1332
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:49,102
She's rich. And I love her.
Don't need to kill her.

1333
01:25:49,178 --> 01:25:51,112
Ah.
What? Ah!

1334
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,047
You've reached
WheezyJoe. What do you want?
Joe!

1335
01:25:54,116 --> 01:25:57,415
Hi, it's Miles Smith...
Mr. Smith... calling to say...

1336
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,579
on behalf of myself,
that it is...
No-go.

1337
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,520
Uh, no-go
concerning Marylin.

1338
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:05,321
I'm speaking with no knowledge;
This is what Mr; Smith wants;

1339
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:07,589
This is what I want.

1340
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:11,030
I am Mr. Smith.
Thank you.

1341
01:26:12,234 --> 01:26:14,429
That was good;

1342
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:17,802
- You think I'm protected?
- Ehh... You...

1343
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:19,704
Am I protected?
I think it would hold up.

1344
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:22,175
- Marylin.
- Yes, yes. Marylin.

1345
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:25,407
- What do we do?
What if he's on his way there?
- Yes. Oh!

1346
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:28,917
- If he's on his way there...
- Oh, no! Marylin!

1347
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:33,648
Get her out and buy some time.
Buy some time!

1348
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:36,818

1349
01:26:38,761 --> 01:26:40,558
Hello?

1350
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,790
Marylin, you must
leave the house immediately.

1351
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,856
It's imperative
that you leave the house.
Hello, Miles.

1352
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:48,425
- Hello, dear.
- Now, Miles, pending final settlement,

1353
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:51,302
you know that I'm entitled
to use the house.
No, no, no! You don't understand!

1354
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,398
It's an emergency!
An emergency!

1355
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:58,071
What is it?
I forgot that I left the gas main on,
which leaks!

1356
01:26:58,147 --> 01:27:01,913
- Good gosh. That sounds dangerous.
- It's a deadly, odorless, colorless,

1357
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:05,420
"liquid-less" gas that... that attacks
the central nervous system...

1358
01:27:05,487 --> 01:27:08,513
and causes diarrhea
and facial tics!

1359
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:12,424
Okay. All right.
Well, thanks for calling, Miles.
Okay. Bye-bye.

1360
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:16,794
I think she bought it.

1361
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:19,026

1362
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:24,667
So, tell me...

1363
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:28,376
who sent you?

1364
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:30,378

1365
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:32,175
Mr. Smith.

1366
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,238
Is this Mr. Smith?

1367
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:36,079
No.

1368
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,844
That's his lawyer.

1369
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:45,621
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double.

1370
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:50,798
What now?
We wait for WheezyJoe.
We tell him it's a no-go.

1371
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:54,458
Careful.
Rottweilers.

1372
01:28:01,243 --> 01:28:04,144
Looks like she's gone.
Looks like she bought it.

1373
01:28:04,213 --> 01:28:07,944
Good stuff.
There's no one here.
Except for the rottweilers.

1374
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:12,214
Sure. Rottweilers.

1375
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,721
You go that way.

1376
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:41,549

1377
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:43,676
WheezyJoe?

1378
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,776

1379
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:20,046
WheezyJoe,
thank God you're in time.

1380
01:29:20,122 --> 01:29:23,558
You're not in time.
We're in time.
Thank God we're in time.

1381
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:29,359
Look, it's a no-go. You get it?
No one need be the wiser,
so you can just go on home.

1382
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:32,559
Good-bye. You know,
thank you so much.

1383
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:35,467
Hear that? Okay?
No, no; No, no; No, no;

1384
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:39,405
No-go. No contract.
It's off. It's...

1385
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:42,444
Will you explain to the lunkhead
that it's a no-go?
No-go. It's a no-go.

1386
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:46,106
We'll settle your contract later;
Look, you're fired, pal;
Let it go; Walk away;

1387
01:29:46,181 --> 01:29:49,378
- Golden parachute.
- Don't let the screen door hit you.
Does he speak any language?

1388
01:29:49,451 --> 01:29:51,646
Here's what happened,
Mr. Carnera. We feel that...

1389
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,245
[Wheezes]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1390
01:29:54,323 --> 01:29:56,382

1391
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:06,161

1392
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:10,836

1393
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,739
Wheezy;! Uh...

1394
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:29,349
Told him it was a no-go.

1395
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:37,559

1396
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,042
Gentlemen.
Freddy;

1397
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,446
- Hello, Marylin.
- Hello, Miles.

1398
01:31:04,326 --> 01:31:08,729
- This is where we first met, remember?
- Of course I remember.

1399
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:15,468
It's hard to believe that when
you walk out that door today,
you'll be walking out of my life forever.

1400
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:18,533
It's not something
I wanted either.

1401
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:20,598
But, then, I guess...

1402
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:24,401
something inside of me died...

1403
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,040
when I realized that
you'd hired a goon to kill me.

1404
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:31,677
Wait a minute.
You hired him to kill me.
No. Both of you wait a minute.

1405
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:34,881
- Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.
- Hear, hear.

1406
01:31:34,957 --> 01:31:37,983
Apparently, from what I can gather,
a burglar broke into your house.

1407
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,585
Miles's house;
Whatever! 

1408
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:44,758
A burglar broke in
intending to loot the place,
uh, repented,

1409
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:48,200
became despondent
over his lifestyle
and shot himself.

1410
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:52,730
- So where does that leave you and me?
- Well, we've outlined a settlement.

1411
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:58,747
We think it's very generous;
My client is prepared
to consider a reconciliation.

1412
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:02,113
But how could I trust you,
Miles, after all this?

1413
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:06,120
See, that's exactly right; The point is...
You wounded me first, Marylin.

1414
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,453
I'm not proud of what I've done,
but God knows, I did trust you once.

1415
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:15,258
If you couldjust...
just give us another chance;

1416
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:20,358
Well, if you'll pardon me here,
but I think my client is well beyond
the point of considering...

1417
01:32:20,435 --> 01:32:24,428
How could I ever trust you again?
I mean, really trust you, Miles?

1418
01:32:38,787 --> 01:32:42,814
Marylin, there is nothing
in the Massey prenup that says...

1419
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,122
it can't be executed
after the parties wed.

1420
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:52,924
Well, if this, uh, indeed
is a Massey prenup,

1421
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:56,903
and a cursory examination
tends to support that it is, then...

1422
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:02,005
Oh, my God, Marylin.
You're exposed.

1423
01:33:05,881 --> 01:33:07,314
Marylin.

1424
01:33:16,525 --> 01:33:19,255
Counselor! Freddy!

1425
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,927
Freddy;! Come on, Freddy;!
No fair;!

1426
01:33:22,998 --> 01:33:25,091
Freddy;!

1427
01:33:29,237 --> 01:33:34,265
Did you hear something?
Only the patter
of little lawyers' feet.

1428
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,811
Where did you find Howard?

1429
01:33:42,884 --> 01:33:46,047
The actor?
From a TV producer.

1430
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:51,457
I think you know him.
I gave him an idea for a new show,
so he made me a partner.

1431
01:33:57,566 --> 01:34:00,899
I guess that means I'm a partner.
I guess it does.

1432
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,334
And what exactly is it
we're partners in?

1433
01:34:14,049 --> 01:34:17,143
Who gets what and who gets who?

1434
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:21,178
You'll find out on
America's Funniest Divorce Videos;

1435
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:25,522
Here's the star of our show,
Gus Petch;!

1436
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:30,921

1437

- Ass;!

1439
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:45,443
Nail your ass!
Nail your ass!

1440
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:50,008
Nail your ass;!

1441
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:52,576

1442

Gus;! Gus;! Gus;! Gus;!
