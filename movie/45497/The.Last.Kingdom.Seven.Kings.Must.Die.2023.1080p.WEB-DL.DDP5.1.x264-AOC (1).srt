[Finan] For a hundred years,
there was chaos in our lands.

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,720
War between Saxons and Dane invaders.

7
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,680
And war between men
who wanted to be kings.

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,200
My lord, Uhtred, son of Uhtred,
born a Saxon, but raised a Dane,

9
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,920
had brought about a fragile peace.

10
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,040
But as King Edward's health faltered,

11
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
trouble spread.

12
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,920
And while most of the country
was sworn to the Saxons,

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,240
Uhtred's land of Northumbria was not.

14
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200

Pass this news to all kings who hate them.

Tell them I have crossed from Irland
and wish to make allies.

36

Well, surely, my guards can--

It is not certain who supports us.

We should flee with your son
whilst we can.

[Eadgifu] I will not forgive this.

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,480
Nor forgive Aethelstan
for leaving us exposed.

57

Then find him and tell him of his death.

Then strike him, from me,

-Bloodhair.

Bloodhair. And what was her name?
She of the curses?

Edward, rightful king of these lands,
has died.

Northumbria recognizes the new king,
Aethelstan.

Do not assume Aethelstan will be king.

-[Aldhelm] The ealdormen of Wessex.

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,920
Of course.
Still claiming Aethelstan's a bastard?

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes. Aelfweard has
the wealth of Wiltunscir behind him.

111
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,720
Our spies in Aegelesburg say he's there,
openly recruiting mercenaries.

112
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,440
We will go to Aegelesburg and seize him
before he is at full force.

113
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,200
We would prefer your guard.

114
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,880
My offer gives Aethelstan the time
to go to Winchester to be crowned,

115
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
and we avoid a clash of armies.

116
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
I swore an oath to protect Aethelstan--

117
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,840
And of course, you are a man of your word.

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,680
Yet your oath to swear your lands
to the king remains unfulfilled.

119
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Your husband showed himself
hostile to those of Danish blood.

120
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,320
As such, he was not the right man
to unite England.

121
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,240
If he had been, England would be united.

[Aldhelm] But now things can be different.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
Aethelstan can be the king
to fulfill the Saxon dream.

If he chooses to swear--

125

I swore an oath of loyalty, and it stands.

126
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,720
If Aelfweard is buying mercenaries,
he will be looking for men from all parts.

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Do you think
we can still execute an ambush?

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
If it is for Aethelstan, then yes.

129

-If he does not fall asleep.
-Once. I fell asleep once.

than a band of young fighters?

find the cold earth calls for them.

159
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,840
Once again, she shows herself a seer.

160
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
Lord, it was nothing.

161
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800
Tell it again.

162
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
"Seven kings must die," Lord.

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,000
-"Seven kings--"
-Ingrith, no.

164
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
Go on.

165
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
"And the woman you love."

166
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm no king, and I have no woman.

167
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,920
-It means nothing.
-[Aldhelm] Lord Uhtred.

168
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
I told my son to train yours.

169
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,560
While you are here,
take Wassa as your serving woman.

170
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,480
-Make this fortress your home.
-I wish to say one thing of Aethelstan.

171
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
He is not quite
the carefree boy you raised.

172
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,600
He has grown very much into his faith.

173
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,480
The Brotherhood of Oswald
exert great influence.

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,880
I have scared off such men before.
For some reason, monks find me terrifying.

175
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,160
[foreboding music playing]

176
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
-[Uhtred] Let's go play kingmaker.
-[Finan] Once again.

177
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,400
[Aethelstan] My father?
No, that cannot be.

178
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,680
I thought God had given him the winter.

179
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,520
[Pyrlig] Lord Aethelstan, you should
make haste to Wessex for coronation.

180
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,800
Your brother gathers men.

181
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,160
Establish yourself at Winchester
before he raises an army.

182
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,560
We will leave when God commands us
to leave, Father Pyrlig.

183
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,760
And that command has not been given.

184
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,480
Return when you have prayed.

185
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
[Aethelstan] Do I depart?

186
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,080
[Ingilmundr] Only the book has answers.

187
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Play.

188
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,400
You have been guided
to the Book of Matthew, verse 157.

189
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,760
"Then Jesus went thence and departed
into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon."

190
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
God wants you to fight.

191
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
Oh. Thank you, lady.

192
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,040
[sentry] Halt. State your business here.

193
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
We heard a man is looking for fighters.

194
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,680
We come to make some coin.

195
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,040
[sentry] Mm.

196
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,360
Go on.

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,840
-This place has fallen to shit.
-[Uhtred] Edward left it to decline.

198
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm glad Aethelflaed
is not here to see it.

199
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,680
[chatter]

200
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,320
Huh.

201
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,840
Word has spread.

202
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,160
[Sihtric] I swear
I've fought half these men.

203
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,200
[Finan] This is not someone
trying to recruit.

204
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,840
This is preparing for a battle.

205
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,520
[Uhtred] That is the youth Aelfweard.

206
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,160
Go see what men know of his plans.

207
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,440
[man] I'll show you a sword!

208
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
[teen] Oh!

209
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Ooh.

210
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,120
-Is that amber in your sword?
-How much do you want for it?

211
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
[groans]

212
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

213
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,520
[groans]

214
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,400
-[Uhtred] Go home to your mothers.
-[teen 2] Edgar! No.

215
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,600
Wilfrid!

216
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Wilfrid!

217
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
Do you speak to me, friend?

218
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
Your pardon. I thought you were Wilfrid.

219
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,840
A great man I fought with at Tettenhall.

220
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,120
Wait, you were at Tettenhall?

221
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
My father was there.

222
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,640
-Who do you fight for now?
-Aelf… something?

223
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,320
-Saxon names are much alike.
-The Aelf who marches on Wessex?

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
You haven't heard.

225
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,320
No one's marching on Wessex.

226
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,920
I'm told the new plan
is to lure Aethelstan here.

227
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,040
Aethelstan is on his way.

228
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
Aelfweard challenged him to battle,
and he's accepted.

229
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,160
Why would he agree to that?

230
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,960
Because he's young,
and they've baited him.

231
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,120
They plan to snare him between the gate
and men hidden in the hills.

232
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Then we take control before he arrives.

233
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,280
We can't seize this town
with just us, Lord.

234
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
We do not need to seize the town.

235
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
[eerie music playing]

236
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
[Finan snores]

237
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,480
[grunts]

238
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,840
[Finan] Hey! Can I tempt you
to play for money, friend?

239
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,560
-[sword rings]
-[grunting]

240
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,960
[Uhtred] Tie them up and secure the bolt.
Stay low until Aethelstan arrives.

241
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
[Finan] If there's a bed, it's mine.

242
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
[birds singing]

243
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
[eerie music continues]

244
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
[Finan snores]

245
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,480
[Uhtred] He's here.

246
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,160
[guard in distance] Raise the alarm!
Soldiers approach the southern gate!

247
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,120
[Aelfweard] Come no further!
Aegelesburg is loyal to me now.

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,560
We do not negotiate with bastards.

249
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,920
Nor do we surrender.

250
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,080
-You'll have to starve us out.
-I am not foolish, brother.

251
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
I assumed you would place a trap.

252
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,520
Perhaps delay me here until your forces
could attack at rearguard.

253
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,960
Show him what's left of his men!

254
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
[grunting]

255
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
[Aethelstan] You can yield now,

256
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,200
or we destroy the gate
and kill all your men.

257
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,800
The gates will hold. No yield will come.

258
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,760
[Aethelstan] Then you will be destroyed.

259
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,160
Get ready to open the door.

260
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
[Aelfweard] I am the rightful king.
Your mother was a whore.

261
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
All good men know it. You have no allies.

262
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,640
Lord Aelfweard.

263
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,480
-I'm Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
-Uhtred.

264
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,920
[Uhtred] You know me
as a man who speaks the truth,

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,800
so hear me when I say,
for the common good, stand down.

266
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,520
My men control the gate.
You're outnumbered on all sides.

267
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,480
Yield.

268
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,040
Let this end with peace.

269
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
[Aethelstan] Give yourself to me, brother.

270
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,240
Then it is over.

271
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
[somber music playing]

272
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,560
Forgive me for my failings,

273
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,240
and give comfort to my mother's kin.

274
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
Tell them of my exile

275
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,160
and how we sought
to honor our discarded bloodline.

276
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
-For Wessex!
-[men] For Wessex!

277
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,880
Lord Uhtred,

278
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
open the gate.

-[slicing]
-[Aelfweard grunts]

280

[squelches]

282
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!

[intense music playing]

286
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
Advance!

287
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,000
[shouting]

288
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,720
Leave no enemy alive!

[commotion]

290
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,840
[Finan] Lord, stop this madness!

291
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
[Uhtred] Stop!

292
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,600

[mercenary] Please, show mercy!

[Uhtred] No!

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,840
Stop! They're surrendering!

301
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,360

-Ah!

Aethelstan!

-Stand down your men.
-[Aethelstan] Uhtred, why are you here?

310
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,480
[Uhtred] To stop this.
Your enemy has surrendered.

311
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,760
Halt your men.

312
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,120
-Let him approach and call a halt.
-[guard] Yes, my lord.

-What happened to you?

-You had no need to kill your brother.
-I did, or in time, he would return.

-You dishonored your word.

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,400
I am, Lord Uhtred.

474
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,880
Some grief has passed, and I feel…

475
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,040
more ready for the world.

476

[peaceful music plays]

[Ingilmundr praying softly]

479
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,760
Forgive us these sins that we commit.

480
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,480
Will we be forgiven?

481
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,240
Our sin weighs heavy.

482
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,200
Yes, it does.

483
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
But remember,

484
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,120
God holds us in the balance.

485
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,280
Every sin can be weighed
against an act of faith.

486
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,920
Grow the faith and the sin is diminished.

487
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,600
What if the shadow of sin
obscures the faith?

488
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,560
Come.

489
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,920
Perhaps return
to your grandfather's vision for England.

490
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,880
Perhaps now there is an urgency
to bring the pagans to light.

491
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,000
Will that

492
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,960
cleanse me?

493
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
Us?

494
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,280
Well, surely the greater the lands,
the greater the faith.

495
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Go beyond what Alfred dreamed of.

496
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,240
Look to the islands God made,
not the countries ordained by men,

497
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,520
and bring all to Christianity.

498
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,160
So when you are judged,

499
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,440
you will be found in balance.

500
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,760
And thus may accept both the sin…

501
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,640
and the conquest against it.

[Eadgifu] What do you talk of?

Oh my faith, Lady. I cannot lie.

509
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,480
The ladies here care for Lord Uhtred
and wish keenly he would find a woman.

[chuckles]

Well, they shall be sore of heart.

512
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,880
The widow of a king will not marry a lord.

513
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,360
Hm.

514
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,680
I shall have to be more careful
in how I conduct myself.

515
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,680
It is not the gossips
you should fear, Lady.

516
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
This peace may not sustain.

517
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,200
Lord Uhtred has snubbed the king.

518

The women Uhtred has affection for
become a target for his enemies.

[Uhtred] What have you learnt?

521
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,520
Aethelstan has claimed Eoferwic.

522
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,280
He says since Rognvaldr is dead,
there is no king, so it belongs to him.

523
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
Eoferwic?

524
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
They see me as their lord now.
Aethelstan knows this.

525
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,080
He is demanding all come with tribute.

526
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,720
Not just Saxon chiefs,
but all kings of Britain.

527
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,480
All the mainland
and all the outlying islands.

Declare yourself king here.

Like your forebears.

531
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
No. This is Aethelstan.

If he chooses the wrong path,
I must tell him.

but, please, there are spies everywhere.

Tell your arseling apprentice
he's badly misjudged the mood of Scotland.

We came to renew our treaty.

Instead, we've been left waiting for days,
only to be told we are supplicants.

00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,240
I would be careful.

We've had other offers of alliance.

-Why is Aethelstan doing this?
-He says to unite Christians.

546
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,040
And in his prayers,
he talks much of atonement.

547
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,400
Atonement? For what?

548
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,400
The death of his brother,
the bastardy of his parentage?

I do not know.

Lord Aldhelm and I try daily to dissuade,

551

-The Devil's Stones.

[Uhtred] This is madness. Aldhelm.

These stones have stood for generations.

They are an insult to God, apparently.

What choice do I have, Uhtred?

He took my son to Winchester.

-He is keeping your son hostage?
-You take the son, you take a future king.

Wealas's faithfulness will not be spat on.

That a Saxon would break us all
to build their country.

This is not just a Saxon country.

I will stop this.

let me speak with you alone.

[Uhtred] You should not
have stepped on my land.

579
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,520
You should not have broken your word,
humiliated me,

580
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,160
as you humiliated my father.

you're on the wrong path.

-I do the bidding of the Lord.

Do you really seek to convert Danes?

-Did I teach you nothing of respect?
-Many Danes welcome the Lord.

-Those in my court thank me for it.
-Many do not wish it, and you know this.

00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,560
Aethelstan, you've always known it.

-Even Alfred respected this.
-I have more to atone for than Alfred.

Who tells you this? Ingilmundr?

589
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,480
Does he tell you
you are damned without his guidance?

590
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,800
For I've seen before men under the spell
of those who claim to know the gods.

He has been a great friend to me.

592

Aethelstan, hump who you wish,

593
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,840
but do not fall under the influence
of those who seek power--

Who makes such vicious claim against me?

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,560
-No one.
-Who tells such lies?

596
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,400
-It has not been talked of.
-Lord Aldhelm, does he spy for…

597
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,640
What has been said,
by who, and for how long?

598
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,520
No one has said anything.
I care not for that, but for you.

599
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,200
Aethelstan, you are a kind man,
but you are tenderhearted,

600
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,160
and Ingilmundr is seeking power
for himself and for his brotherhood.

601
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,640
Lies. Lies and ignominy.

602
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,080
There's no ignominy.
He just turns you from your kin.

603
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,920
And you are turned from your king!

604
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,280
You seek to be one yourself.

Lord, they consecrate the ground

606
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,040
and would request you
to give the blessing.

607
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,920
Yes, of course.

608

Let us leave the King of Northumbria
to think on his errors.

609
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,240
I have no dream to be a king.

610
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,120
Only to protect you.

611
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,520
Like you ran to protect him in Aegelesburg
and ended up being beaten by boys?

612
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,240
Should he really take counsel from a man
who loses his sword to a child?

613
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,880
Northumbria needs a lord
with lust for battle.

There are rumors Anlaf has arrived
and will come Viking.

615
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,240
Do not think he will spare you
just because you follow the same gods.

616
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,880
Keep him here a night
and make him swear at dawn.

617
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,840
In time, you will come
begging for his help.

618
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,240
As all fathers fall,

619
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
and all sons take their place.

Sh.

622
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,120
Lord Ingilmundr has declared you
an enemy of God

623
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,040
to incite his followers to kill you.

624
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,720
Aethelstan would not allow it.

625
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,920
Which is why Ingilmundr
seeks to keep his hands clean of it

626
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,200
and has left the camp.

627

To go where?

628
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
[Aldhelm] This way.

629
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Go up and around. There's no guard.

00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,000
Him. That is the man.

631
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,880
What did you speak of with the pagan?

632
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
[agitated music builds]

633
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,480
[sentry] Horsemen approach!

634
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,720
[Osbert] Stay back from my gates
and tell me who you are.

635
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,000
Lord Ingilmundr,
and I come at Lord Uhtred's request.

636
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,240
He's delayed in Eoferwic
as he renews his vow to the king.

637
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,360
He asked I help protect you.

638
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,800
Protect from what?

639
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,040
There is a rumor of Wolf-Warriors
landed near Derwent.

640
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,000
[guard] Open the gate! Open the gate!

641

[music fades]

643
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,520
Do not give the order.

644
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,800
Think on all we have shared.

645
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,000
You're lost from yourself, Aethelstan.

646
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,480
We fought together--

647
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,000
And despite this, you drip poison
against me and plot with Uhtred.

648
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,960
-No.
-Yes.

649
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,280
-No.
-Yes!

650
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,160
You turned your back, Aldhelm.

651
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Now I turn mine.

652
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
[haunting vocal music playing]

[rope tightens]

656
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,160
[Eadgifu] Lord Ingilmundr,

657
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,920
you bring welcome news
of Lord Uhtred's supplication.

658
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Will you journey south with me
to let me bear witness to it?

659
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,040
Lady, we have ridden hard to get here.
At least let us rest a day or so.

660
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,680
Oh, but I have been trapped in Bebbanburg
a good while.

661
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,800
Believe me, you do not want to find
yourself here longer than intended.

662
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,080
[horse grunts softly]

663
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,120
-They've been warned!
-[Finan] Now!

664
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,120
[grunting]

665
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,920
We overtook you on the road.

666
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Whatever power you hold over Aethelstan,

667
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,320
today it ends.

668
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,520
[Ingilmundr grunts] My sword!

669
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,920
[groans]

670
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,480
[Uhtred chuckles]

671
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,360
You still believe in Valhalla!

672
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,680
Aethelstan cares for you.
I will not divide us further.

673
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,840
Put him below.

674
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,360
Christians amongst you, defend me!
Who is your Lord?

675
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,040
Lord Uhtred or the Lord Jesus Christ?

676
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,760
The people of Bebbanburg
will not be divided by faith.

677
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,800
Rise up, you fools!

678
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,640
Tell the king the terms of his release.

679
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,800
He makes peace with Northumbria
and guarantees the border.

680
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,680
-No one is forced to follow his god.
-Yes, Lord.

681
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,600
Quite a price.

682
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,680
-Will Aethelstan agree?
-[Uhtred] Let us hope so.

683
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,400
He seems to discard his friends
rather quickly now.

684
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,160
[discordant music playing]

685
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,360
[Ingilmundr] Truly, you bless
an unworthy soul.

686
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,840
[water drips]

687

[determined music playing]

689
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,640
[Anlaf] Aethelstan turns
against his friends.

690
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,760
Succumbs to a wild dream
to be a monarch for all your land.

691
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,560
In time, he will come for you, Shetland.

692
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,560
You, Orkney.

693
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,680
He will take what belonged
to your forebears and call it Britain.

694
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,440
[Shetland] No.

695
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,280
He barely sets his foot upon the water.
Saxon country folk.

696
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,240
We can repel them.

697
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm not talking of repelling,
but of meeting conquest with conquest.

698
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,760
[Domnal] Scotland rejects your offer.

699
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,760
We cannot join with pagans
to attack a man who's not threatened us.

700
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,440
Christians do not choose war.

701
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,960
War is coming.

702
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,120
You only have to choose a side.

703

[whispering]

[rustling]

707
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,760
[Wassa] The stone was rolled away,
as in the scripture.

708
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,680
It can only be the work of an angel.

709
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,440
This way, Lord.
Come and see the treasures.

710
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,360
[Sihtric] Lord!

711
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,200
What word from Eoferwic?

712
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,760
Does he accept my terms?

713
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,440
I have no news.

714
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
Aethelstan is said
to have returned to Winchester.

715
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,080
Well, let us take it as a good sign.

716
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,680
Perhaps without his shadow,
Aethelstan sees more clearly.

717
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,120
[Sihtric] What trouble
brings you out here?

718
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,360
[Finan] The villagers were
hunting for pagan silver.

719
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,200
Now they're saying it's a miracle.

720
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,800
[Wassa] Make way
for the King of Northumbria.

721
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,200
I told you.

722
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,200
They think of you as a king.

723
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,520
[Finan] Do you think
they hope to keep half for themselves?

724
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,800
[Sihtric] They likely took it
from Bebbanburg in the first place.

725
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,240
[man] You are detained
in the name of King Aethelstan.

726
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,240
[Finan] Lord.

727
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,120
[sinister music builds]

728
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,520
We've been lured here.

729
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,240
You think?

730
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,400
[Wassa] Lord, I'm sorry!

731
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,840
I'm sorry, Lord.

732
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,600
The prisoner told me I had to,
or I'd burn in the fires of hell.

733
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,920
I will never order to open the gates.

734
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,440
[man] Really?

735
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,360
A gift from the king.

736
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,640
Oh.

737
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,480
Aethelstan did this?

738
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,200
It's what he does to traitors.

739
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,560
Open the gates or I slaughter your father.

740
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,120
Comply and he will be spared.

741
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,160
Do not open.

742
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,000
-I can kill him in front of you.
-Do not open!

743
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,000
-The choice is yours.
-[Uhtred] Osbert! Do not open!

744
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,440
In your absence, Father, I command here.

745
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,040
And I command that we open.

746
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,800
-No!
-[Sihtric] No, no, no!

747
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,680
[guard] Drop your sword.

748
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,600
Move.

749
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,880
No.

750
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,960
Where is Aethelstan?

751
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,600
In time.

752
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,800
Bring me the Lady Eadgifu.

753
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,760
Come. [grunts]

754
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,120
[Eadgifu] I can walk.

755
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,920
[Eadgifu] Go on.

756
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,080
Kill me.

757
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,640
[Ingilmundr] You are to be placed
in the community on Lindisfarne

758
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,920
to protect your virtue.

759
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,720
[grunts softly]

760
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,160
Did you hump the heathen, Lady?

761
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,720
Confess.

762
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,880
I confess

763
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,160
to have prayed
for your excruciating death.

764
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,960
A no, then. You should have tried
when you had the chance.

765
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,360
We're taking your son to my garrison

766
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,600
at Thelwael
where he will be trained for battle.

767
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,840
No. No. Please.

768
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,560
-[guard] Move!
-Your son also.

769
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,680
[Eadgifu] No.
Edmund is the blood of Alfred.

770
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,000
He should not be fodder for a shield wall!
Please!

771
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,960
-[Osbert] I will take care of him.
-Please!

772
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,680
[Eadgifu gasps breathlessly]

773
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,320
The son of Uhtred stands for Wessex.

774
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,560
[grunts]

775
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,360
Ah.

776
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,400
[Finan] Hey! Hey!

777
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,120
Whoa.

778
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,200
You, we have a plan for.

779
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,920
-[Uhtred] Am I to be drowned in the sea?
-[Ingilmundr] I never quite know his mind.

780
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,760
[Uhtred] Do not punish
those in Bebbanburg.

781
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,560
-His fight is with me.
-His fight is elsewhere.

782
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,880
How lucky we have found ourselves
so close to the Scottish border.

783
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,600
No, do not invade Scotland.
You will lose hundreds of men.

784
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,240
And unleash a war for generations.

785
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,600
The king has no successor to fear for.
It makes him strong.

786
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,880
Do whatever you must to protect our sons.
Do not fight him. Just capitulate.

787
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,280
Anything else is foolish.

788
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,840
-Aldhelm never betrayed you.
-All of you betrayed me.

789
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,280
All those I thought as friends.

790
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,000
Swear now, before Bebbanburg,
and I will spare your life.

791
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,200
-No.
-Then you leave me with no choice.

792
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,640

Aethelstan.

[music building]

796
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,160
I cannot.

797
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,840
-Let me offer my--
-No.

798
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,960
Take everything from him.

799
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,680
I banish you from my lands
to travel the earth and seas alone.

800
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,960
On pain of murder of your son.

801
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,720
Let none feed or clothe him,
lest become my enemy.

802
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,920
Go.

803
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,880
Before this mercy vanishes.

804
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,520
[music builds dramatically]

805
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,160
[Hywel] Turn back. There is still time.

806
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,440
The Scots are no threat.

807
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,360
This will damn you, Lord King.

808
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,280
[screaming]

809
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,320
[Hywel] To save us from the pagans
can be a just endeavor.

810
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,800
But to turn on other Christians
is ungodly.

811
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,000
[yelling]

812
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,480
[breathes raggedly]

813
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,120
[Hywel] Your men do not want this fight.

814
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,320
[Aethelstan] Well, perhaps
I need better men.

815
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,360
Perhaps I should summon your son.

816
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,160
Lord King!

817
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,320
Aethelstan has attacked settlements
in the lowlands.

818
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,640
He cannot raid us without reply.

819
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,360
Do I tell Anlaf you are ready
to meet with him and the other kings?

820
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
[yelling]

[grunts]

824
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,480
Uhtred the Daneslayer.

825
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,280
You killed my cousin Gelf
at the battle of Beamfleot.

826
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,120
[echoes] …the battle of Beamfleot.

827
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,640
Send word we have found him.

828
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,840
I hated Gelf.

829
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,360
[echoes] Gelf, Gelf…

830
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,720
Take him to the king.

831
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,720
[Uhtred] Where are you taking me?

832
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,720
[woman] To the very north
of these islands.

833
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,800
[rhythmic music playing]

[commotion]

836
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,360
-[Uhtred] What do you give thanks for?
-For the great battle to come.

837
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,080
Tell the jarl we're here
with the King of Northumbria.

838
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,280
[warrior grunts]

839
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,320
[shouting]

840
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,520
-[Uhtred] All folk of Shetland?
-[woman] Some of Man and Orkney join us.

841
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,120
With their kings. [chuckles]

842
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,120
[whooping]

843
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,880
[talking softly]

844
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,400
[Anlaf] Is this who they claim?

845
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,160
The King of Northumbria?

846
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,520
[Constantin] Aye, it's him.

847
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,840
-I am no king.
-[Anlaf] No.

848
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,280
But you could be.

849
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,000
Sit. You are amongst friends.

850
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,120
[Uhtred] You join with pagans?

851
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,680
Aethelstan has taken an axe to the truce.

852
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,080
A truce you brokered.

853
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,520
What he has done
in the villages of the lowlands--

854
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,800
-Is it worse than his cruelty in Irland?
-Tales to spread fear.

855
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,920
[Constantin] We had no choice
but to defend ourselves.

856
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,880
We did not start this.

857
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,680
-How did you find me? Who's your spy?
-We have many spies. We know many things.

858
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,000
[Constantin] We know
Aethelstan has banished you.

859
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,080
And we know he gets humped like a woman.

860
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,880
That may be customary to you pagans,

861
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,920
but as a Christian, it cannot be endured.

862
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,560
-He endures it often, from what I hear.
-So…

863
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,560
As a man who shares our enemy,

864
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,120
we ask you to join with us, Uhtred,
in our alliance.

865
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Stand against the tyrant.

866
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,440
I'm heartsick of battles.

867
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,120
What has become of the warrior?
Do you no longer yearn for Valhalla?

868
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,240
Do you know the prophecy, Uhtred?

869
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
The ancient prophecy of my people?

870
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,440
All of Britain
will unite against the Saxons,

871
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,320
push them into the Kentish sea,

872
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,160
return the feals to the line of Arthur.

873
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,360
[Anlaf] There.

874
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,400
The vision of an old man.

875
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,960
-So it must be true.
-We Northumbrians also have a prophecy.

876
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,080
"Seven kings must die."

877
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,720
That holds no fear.

878
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,280
Each man here has a son to take his place.

879
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,920
[Owain] Seven kings die,

880
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,680
seven will, in that moment, be made.

881
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,800
[Anlaf] It's true.

882
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,800
If you make a child,
your kingdom stands beyond you.

883
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,080
A kingdom ravaged by war, yes.

884
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,160
[Constantin] Then there is another way

885
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,840
to consider.

886
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,640
If you wish to save many from bloodshed.

887
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,000
Kill one man only.

888
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,520
Kill the king who has attacked us all.

889
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,440
Return to him in… supplication.

890
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,160
Seize the moment.

891
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,240
Save many lives by simply taking one.

892
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,480
[Anlaf] The alternative,
of course, is war.

893
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,240
Seven kings against one.

894
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,120
If Aethelstan wanted to unite
the tribes of Britain,

895
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,120
he has succeeded.

896
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,760
[triumphant music playing]

897
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,920
[Anlaf] Why do you seek us here?

898
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,040
Your part is to keep Winchester aroused.

899
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,160
You let Uhtred go free. Why?

900
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,000
I sent him away.

901
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,080
To kill your friend, the king.

902
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,080
-Well, he will be killed in the attempt.
-[woman chuckles]

903
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,920
Uhtred has skills you do not.

904
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,240
He attacks Aethelstan.
Aethelstan attacks him.

905
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,480
It barely matters.

906
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,880
Either way, we face in battle
men whose spirits have been broken.

907
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,880
Ingilmundr, go to the West.
The time is near.

908
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,600
Astrid, watch our friends in Northumbria.

909
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,680
[ominous music playing]

910
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,040
[door opens]

911
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,520
[footsteps approach]

912
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,200
[Aethelstan] I did not think
I would see you again.

913
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,920
Lord King.

914
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,520
In the name of my son, I beg forgiveness.

915
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,680
Spare him.

916
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
Let me kneel to you.

917
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,520
[sighs]

918
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,360
Then I lift your banishment.

919
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,640
Give me a sword and then leave us.

920
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,040
Go on, then.

921
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,680
Do it.

922
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,560
I swear this on my son's life.

923
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,400
Hear this as an oath.

924
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,520
Ingilmundr is a spy.

925
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,000
He's working with Anlaf
to ally British kings against you.

926
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,320
-Lies.
-It is true. I saw him in Shetland.

927
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,240
He told Anlaf's warriors to track me.
They tried to turn me--

928
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,800
No! [grunts]

929
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,560
-He is in Thelwael with your son!
-He told them things of you.

930
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,520
[grunting]

931
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,520
He still follows my gods.

932
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,480
[sword clatters]

933
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,880
For now, you have an advantage.

934
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,640
Ingilmundr does not know
he has been discovered.

935
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,040
[Aethelstan] No, he would not betray me.

936
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,720
If anything, I have betrayed him.

937
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,400
-No.
-He is a man of God, and I am a sinner!

938
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,800
He has convinced you of this
to provoke your campaign.

939
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,640
-To unite your enemies.
-No!

940
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,800
Aethelstan, please see this. This alliance
he has gathered is too large.

941
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,320
-Your lands will be overrun.
-No! You lie!

942
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,520
This is all lies!

943
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,440
Aethelstan, please hear me.

944
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,680
Why would I lie to you?

945
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,320
-Get out.
-Aethelstan--

946
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,840
Get out. Get from my sight! Guards!

947
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,320
-[door opens]
-Take him!

948
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,440

01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,520
Ah!

951
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,640
[guard] You dog! On your way.

952
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,320
[Sihtric] We search every forest,
every valley.

953
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,320
[Finan] And here he is,
back in the lap of luxury.

954
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,360
We heard you needed us.

955
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,560
Truly the gods smiled at me
to give me such friends.

956
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,960
[Finan] Let's find ourselves an alehouse,

957
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,440
make a plan.

958
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,520
-Who told you I was here?
-[Sihtric] She said you called for us.

959
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,920
-Did you not send for us, Lord?
-She said you needed us.

960
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,040
And requested a guard.

961
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,240
Danish girl, serves in Aethelstan's court.

962
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,480
Finan, I sent no word.

963
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,400
No command for you to leave Bebbanburg.

964
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,120
[unsettling music playing]

965
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,360
-[Sihtric] Stay here and guard the gates.
-[man] Yes, Lord.

966
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,520
[Uhtred] Wolf-Warriors.

967
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,680
[Uhtred] This is Anlaf's doing.

968
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,480
[Finan] Ingrith!

969
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,480
[breathes shakily]

970
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,600
[Sihtric] Lord, where are they all?

971
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
[breathes shakily]

972
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,560
-[Uhtred] Eadgifu?
-Uhtred.

973
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,040
What happened?

974
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,480
[Eadgifu] When news reached us
of the attack and torture here,

975
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,880
the abbess sent us to help the injured.

976
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,280
But we cannot get to the injured.

977
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,240
Where… Where is she? Where's my wife?

978
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,600
"Seven kings must die," Lord.

979
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,400
"Seven kings

980
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,520
and the woman you love."

981
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,000
Ingrith!

982
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,960
-No. Ingrith!
-Every man is to help move it.

983
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,120
You, up above.

984
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,880
-[Finan] Can anyone hear me?
-[Uhtred] Watch for signs of Anlaf's men.

985
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,440
We tried to help,
but all we could do was comfort them.

986
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,280
Uhtred, Ingrith said
they threatened to return.

987
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,400
-We must secure ourselves.
-Not until we rescue those within.

988
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,720
When did you speak last?

989
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,880
About three days ago.

990
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,520
-[Finan] Get the rope up there!
-[man grunts]

991
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,640
[Finan] Come on!

992

[melancholy choral music playing]

01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,520
Now!

1000
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,600
Finan.

1001
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,440
Where is…

1002
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,160
[in anguish] No!

1003
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,240
[choral music continues]

1004
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,720
[Uhtred] I brought this on them.

1005
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,240
What they suffered is on Anlaf's account.

1006
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,520
You cannot let this break you.

1007
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,400
We are broken.

1008
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,640
We have no allies. We're lost.

1009
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,200
Then we must find the courage
to defend Northumbria from their return.

1010
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,720
If we endure and keep them at siege,

1011
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,960
we will give those
in other parts of England time to prepare.

1012
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,080
Whatever we suffer

1013
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,600
protects those we are apart from.

1014
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,960
[Sihtric] She's right, Lord.

1015
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,240
Osbert can cross the Irish Sea, get to--

1016
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,280
The Irish Sea?

1017
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,560
We must find the fastest horses. I think
Anlaf is hoping to turn all eyes here.

1018
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,040
To lure Aethelstan.

1019
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,560
But they will land where they have men.
Ingilmundr holds a garrison in the Wirral.

1020
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,000
With… With our sons.

[man 2] Take care.

-[men shouting]
-[Osbert] Get in the cart.

Those of you with swords to your throats
face a decision.

1029
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,840
A thousand ships
are heading towards these shores.

1030
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,840
Some have already landed.

1031
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,680
Within a week,
Saxon boroughs will be overrun.

1032
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,680
Join us and fight the tyrant Aethelstan,

1033
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,400
or die.

01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,920
[woman] Yes, sir. I believe so.

1039
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,800
We saw them, but they got away.

1040
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
-There. Far away.
-Thank you.

1041
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,520
[woman] Yes, my lord.

1042
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,280
[Sihtric] No word from Thelwael, Lord.

1043
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,880
[woman] Told them all I knew.

1044
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,800
Sihtric.

1045
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,600
Lord?

1046
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,360
Do we finally face defeat?

1047
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,480
All the warrior kings that I've known,
Ubba, Cnut, Bloodhair,

1048
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,120
all have faced defeat in the end
and have taken others with them.

1049
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,480
The fight was always coming, Lord.
No warrior dies a peaceful death.

1050
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,760
She saw it all. "Seven kings must die."

1051
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,800
We have hope.

1052
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,000
In your heart,
you never wanted to be a king.

1053
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,320
[Eadgifu] Have those fleeing
heard anything of my son?

1054
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,160
Then until I know for sure,

1055
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,400
he is alive.

1056
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:32,640
And if conquest is easy, perhaps
Anlaf may be satisfied with Mercia.

1057
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,520
-It is fertile--
-[Uhtred] He will not be satisfied.

1058
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,640
They come Viking now
to extinguish an idea of England.

1059
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,200
A dream unites a people
who once sought to kill each other.

1060

Without it, we go back

We have both lost so much.

But I ask myself…

1064
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,120
am I alive?

1065
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,080
Can you feel it?

1066
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,600
[Uhtred] You are alive.

1067

So are you.

1068

To prove that you had lied to me.

1076
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,760
But you had not.

1077
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,920
[Uhtred] We came to search for our sons.

1078

and were spared the massacre.

you have my endless gratitude.

01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,960
[Aethelstan] I've not been myself
this past year, and truly,

1087
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,000
truly, I…

1088
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,840
I pay for my sins.

1089
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,280
I face a great alliance at Brunanburh.

1090
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,160
All regret is worthless.

1091
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,480
Let us speak only of the fight to come.

-Osbert, what have you learnt?
-They've set up camp on high ground.

1093
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,280
And they have six armies.

1094
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,960
Then seven armies
shall meet at Brunanburh.

1095
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,040
I do not want you to fight for me, Uhtred.

-[Uhtred] Trust I'm on your side--

Take your son to safety.

If I do not survive the battle,
then succession will be secure.

1100
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,440
You cannot fight this alliance alone.

1101

[Aethelstan] Yet I forbid you
from taking part.

Please, take them all.

Aethelstan…

1105
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,200
this is not a punishment.

01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,640
[Uhtred] This is martyrdom.

1108
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,400
He will not survive so great a number.

1109
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,480
But we have been reprieved.

1110
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,400
-God is telling us to get to safety.
-Your god does not speak to me.

1111
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,440
It is not cowardly
to spurn a battle that cannot be won.

1112
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,560
It is.

1113
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,200
However this prevails, I will have to know
I walked away from danger.

1114
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,640
Your battles will come

1115
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,440
when you become king.

1116
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,600
King of where, Mother?

1117
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,720
-We will fight with the shield wall.
-No.

1118
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,640
-Osbert, are you ready?
-I've always been ready.

1119
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,640
Pyrlig, you once told me
that it was my destiny to save England.

1120
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,480
Hadn't seen it quite like this,
but then I'm not one for prophecies.

1121
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,240
[Eadgifu] What if your destiny
is to protect Edmund?

1122
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,760
Perhaps he is the one to unite England.
He could be the king who was worthy.

1123
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,720
No king will form England.

1124
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,600
This is what I see now.

1125
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,280
Not Edmund or Edward or Alfred.
Not even Aethelstan.

1126
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,920
Alfred's dream was of a united people.

1127
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,840
And with these men,
from all parts, I fought for it.

1128
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,240
What if our destiny
was not to form England,

1129
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,520
but to form the English as one force?

1130
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,680
Who better than a half Saxon, half Dane
to lead men from divided places?

1131
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,120
[Uhtred] We go!

1132
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,240
I don't have to call myself English, do I?

[metal scraping]

1142
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,360
[Uhtred] We should make our way.

1143
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,160
If this is to work,
we need to be on the front line.

1144
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,040
-We'll aim for their left side.
-Why?

1145
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,040
Why the left?

1146
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,600
Weaker. Most men fight
with the sword in their right hand.

1147
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,240
I've fought with Uhtred many times.
Trust he will find a way.

1148
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,680
You.

1149
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,120
Where did you find that?

1150
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,760
I bought it in Aegelesburg
for five pieces.

1151
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,560
May I?

1152
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,600
I will exchange it for this one.

1153
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,120
It is worth much more,
and it has a garnet.

1154
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,280
When I say exchange, I mean
you take that one, and I keep this one.

1155
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,120
[Uhtred] I am no commander of yours.

1156
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,960
I have no authority other than being
a man who has fought in many battles.

1157
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,400
Some of you I have led before.

1158
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,240
Today I stand with you
as a simple soldier.

1159
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,640
But I ask that, on the field,

1160
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,840
you once again let me guide you.

1161
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,080
Our position on the hill is weak,

1162
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,800
but the trees to our left give us
an advantage the enemy will not see.

1163
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,520
We can defeat them

1164
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,800
if we stay united.

1169

[Finan] Aye.
Maybe they smelled us and ran away.

1170

Uhtred.

1181
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,760
-How do we face this?
-You see these bags?

1182
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,000
Give them to the men
on the front line. Go.

[yelling]

1184

[Uhtred] Do not raise your shield
until you have to.

1185
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,240
Stay at ease. Stay relaxed.

1186
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,520
-And do not show them we are unsettled.
-[Finan] Lord!

1187

He's here.

1188
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,040
[Anlaf] Here he comes. The tyrant himself.

1189

[Uhtred] Is it done?

I have taken their confessions.

1197
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,840
When I ask you to give ground,

1198
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,880
do it.

1199
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,960
When you see the trees in front of you,
it will be time.

Do you think this will work?

1201

If it does not,
we will not be here to see it.

Trust me.

Tell me the truth.

01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,600
When you find yourself before God,
you will have confessed.

1339
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,600
I grew fond of you.

-But my love for my people prevailed.
-I chose you over my people.

Perhaps my gods are stronger than yours.

Then why am I living…

-[Finan] The victory is ours.

-[Finan] "Seven kings must die."

With Edward of Wessex, it makes six.

Am I to be the seventh?

1363

I have told the chroniclers
to write of your victory, Uhtred.

1364
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:55,240
I have no wish
to be written into your history.

1365
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,680
I want only to be honored
in the feast hall for standing by an oath.

1366
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,360
Uhtred, you did not just stand by me.

1367
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,280
You stood for me.

1368
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,520
You led where I could not.

1369
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,320
And you forgave me

1370
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,120
when I was unforgivable.

1371
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,600
You saved the hope of England.

01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,200
Now in time, it may yet happen.

1373
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,120
I said that…

1374
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,680
if you proved yourself
to be the rightful king,

1375
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,360
I would swear Northumbria to you.

1376
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,040
Men have died
fighting under the name of the English.

1377
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,000
To honor them, England should be formed.

1378
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,560
But I have one condition.

1379
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,600
You must make an oath never to marry.

1380
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,360
No heirs.

1381
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:20,480
So your brother Edmund
can take the throne unchallenged.

1382

Thank you.

1383

This oath

I shall swear.

1385
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,080
Then we submit to you as our king.

1386
01:44:55,160 --> 01:45:00,120
Which makes you ruler
of Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia,

1387
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,360
and Northumbria.

1388
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,240
And I call my lands

1389
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,680
England.

1390
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,760
Long live the king!

[Uhtred] Long live the King of England.

1393

Return to your chamber, Lord.

Do not grieve for me.

1395

It was always written
that I would fall in battle.

1396

[Finan] You're not gonna die, Lord.

The chronicles do not record
if my lord Uhtred survived.

1408
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,720
But those like me, who knew him,

1409
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,120
recognize him
as the greatest warrior of our age,

1410
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,440
and a man who made a kingdom.
