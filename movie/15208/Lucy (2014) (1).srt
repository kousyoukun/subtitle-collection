1
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,070
生命诞生于十亿年前
Life was given to us a billion years ago.

2
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,070
我们又是如何利用它的呢
What have we done with it?

3
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,040
露西  小菜一碟
Lucy. It's easy as pie.

4
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,660
一进一出  完事大吉
In and out, all done and dusted.

5
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,220
那你为什么不自己干
And why don't you do it yourself?

6
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,950
那家伙肯定想不到
The last thing the guy's expecting

7
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,100
是大美女来送货
is a total 10 turning up to deliver the case.

8
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,100
-绝对会大吃一惊  拜托  -里面是什么
- It'll blow his mind. Come on! - What's in it?

9
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,040
宝贝  别乱想好吗
Sweetheart! Don't get paranoid on me, all right?

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,610
你还信不过我啊
You trust me, don't you?

11
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,490
操
Fuck!

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,620
理查德  我真心喜欢你  可...
Richard, I really do like you. But...

13
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,330
这会儿我得处理自己的事  我得...
I have to take care of myself right now. I gotta...

14
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,670
我也不知道  反正有一堆事
I don't know. I've got to concentrate on so many things.

15
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,050
嘿  你去哪儿
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

16
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,420
回家啊  周一我有考试
I'm going home, because I have exams on Monday.

17
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,590
我得洗个澡  得学习
I have to shower and I have to study, okay?

18
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,930
知道吗  那天我在博物馆
You know what? The other day, I was in this museum.

19
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,100
-知道我发现了什么吗  -什么
- And you know what I found out? - What?

20
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,560
史上第一位女性就叫露西
The first ever woman was named Lucy.

21
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,480
-你是想让我心情好点吗  -对  不
- Is that supposed to make me feel better? - Yeah. No.

22
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,990
-电话联系吧  -好吧  好吧
- I'll call you. Okay? - Okay, okay, okay.

23
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,660
跟你说实话吧  我没法亲自送箱子
I'll be honest with you. I can't deliver the case myself.

24
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,470
我跟那家伙闹过意见  没什么大事
I had a little falling-out with the guy. It's nothing major,

25
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,590
但如果你肯去  这事就解决了
but if it's you, problem solved.

26
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,500
你进去直奔前台
You walk in there, you go up to the reception,

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
叫姜先生下楼
you ask for Mr. Jang to come down.

28
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,750
等他下来拿到箱子
He comes down, he takes the case,

29
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,840
你送上一个迷人微笑  然后便走人
you flash him your prettiest smile and bounce.

30
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,260
你看  从这里都能看到前台
Look! You can even see the reception from here.

31
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,430
拜托了
Come on.

32
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,600
-里面是什么  -不知道  就是些文件
- What's in the case? - I don't know, it's just some paperwork.

33
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,680
是吗  那让我看看
Yeah? Let's see it then.

34
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,890
锁着呢  只有姜先生有密码
It's locked. And only Mr. Jang has the code.

35
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,900
我就是个跑腿的
I'm just the delivery boy.

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,940
-送这个有钱拿吗  -算有吧
- Do you get paid to do this? - Yeah, kind of.

37
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,800
多少
Like how much?

38
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,280
我们这就谈钱还是...
Okay! We are negotiating now or...

39
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,910
不是  你能拿多少  我想知道数
No, no. How much do you get paid? I want to know how much.

40
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,240
一千块
A thousand dollars.

41
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,160
送送文件就能拿一千  真的假的
You get paid a thousand dollars for delivering paperwork? Really?

42
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,000
谁知道  反正花十分钟就赚一千块
I don't know. It takes me 10 minutes and they pay me a grand

43
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,210
其它又不关我的事
and the rest is none of my business.

44
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,000
行  那跟你说  这也不关我的事
Well, it's none of my business either, I'll tell you now.

45
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,670
-听着  -怎么
- Listen! - What?

46
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,630
我们一人一半
We split it down the middle.

47
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,380
你五百  我五百
That's 500 for you, and 500 for me.

48
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,790
理查德  回头联系
Richard, I will call you.

49
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,720
听我说  这星期我已经三次
Listen, it's the third time this week,

50
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,600
戴着同一顶帽子出现在同一家酒店了
I'm showing up in the same hotel, with the same cowboy hat.

51
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,190
问题解决
Problem solved!

52
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,600
去吧  我等着你  去吧
Go, go. I'll wait for you. Go.

53
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,710
露西  宝贝  我都干无数遍了
Lucy, honey... I've done this a dozen times.

54
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,320
只是文件而已
It's paperwork.

55
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,690
也许是为了造假而掉包的设计图纸
It's probably just some designs they switched so they can copy them.

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
这国家就搞这套
That's how it works in this country.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
连我这牛仔帽都是这里产的  你看
Even my Stetson was made here. Look.

58
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,950
标签上还印着呢  "台湾制造"
Says so on the label, "Made in Taiwan."

59
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,450
回见  戴山寨帽子的牛仔
So long, cowboy with the fake Stetson.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,540
宝贝  求你了
Baby, please.

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,330
理查德  我真得走了  而且说真的...
Richard, I got to go. And seriously...

62
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,290
-你搞什么啊  -对不起
- What the hell are you doing? - I'm sorry.

63
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,610
真对不起  你真得帮帮我
I'm so sorry. I really need your help.

64
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,050
闭嘴  别闹了  快把手铐打开
Stop! Stop it! Take this off me right now!

65
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,380
-我打不开  -快打开手铐
- I can't. - Take this off me right now!

66
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,340
我打不开  只有姜先生有钥匙
I can't, Mr. Jang's the only one who has the key.

67
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,180
你只需要走进酒店
All you have to do is go into the hotel

68
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,640
到前台找他
and ask for him at the reception.

69
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,920
不行  快打开
No! Take it off me right now!

70
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,430
非常抱歉  我真的没办法
I'm so sorry. I really have no choice.

71
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,270
你越早进去才能越早出来
The sooner you go in, the sooner you'll be back out!

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,040
真不敢相信你这样对我
I can't believe you did this to me.

73
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,810
我就在这儿  我保证
I'll be right here. You have my word.

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,940
你的保证屁都不值
Your word isn't worth shit!

75
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,860
值五百块呢  先给钱
It's worth 500 bucks, up front.

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,400
-你是个大混蛋  -你是个活菩萨
- You're an asshole. - And you're wonderful.

77
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,380
-小姐  有什么需要吗  -是的
- Miss, may I help you? - Yes.

78
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,180
我来找...
I'm here for...

79
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,680
姜先生
Mr. Jang.

80
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,180
好的
Yes...

81
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,480
我该说哪位找他
Who should I say is here?

82
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,030
理查德
Richard.

83
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,320
不是  是理查德派我来的
Uhm... no... Richard sent... Richard sent me.

84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,610
姜先生 您好 在柜台有位女士要找您

85
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,790
请问您是
What is your name?

86
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,040
不对  是理查德
No, Richard.

87
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,040
理查德在...他在找车位
Richard's... he's just looking for a place to park.

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,370
她说她是跟理查德一起来的

89
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,140
姜先生还是想知道您的名字
Mr. Jang still wants to know your name.

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,350
-露西  -姓呢
- Lucy. - Lucy what?

91
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,900
就是露西  麻烦他快点  我还得...
Just Lucy. If he could... if he could be quick, because I have to...

92
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,590
稍等我给他翻译
Just a second while I translate.

93
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,900
姜先生 她说她叫作露西

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,640
她只愿意告诉我这么多  好的

95
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,830
姜先生马上来  待在这里别动
Mr. Jang is on his way. Stay right here.

96
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,580
我能坐下吗
Can I sit?

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,830
姜先生说让你待在这里别动
Mr. Jang said you need to stay right here.

98
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,040
我觉得你最好就待着别动
I think it's better if you stay right here.

99
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,540
不好意思  晶华酒店
Excuse me. Regent Hotel.

100
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,190
不
No!

101
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,190

No! Please!

107
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,170
你讲英语吗
Do you speak English?

108
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,490
露西  对  我是露西
Lucy! Yes, I'm Lucy.

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,870
这是个天大的误会
This has just been a terrible mistake.

110
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,870
我只是来送这个箱子的
I'm just supposed to deliver this case.

111
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,830
万一您钥匙丢了  请别砍我的手
If you lost the key, you don't have to chop off my hand.

112
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,000
砍断链子可以吗
You can just cut the chain, okay?

113
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,750
求求你  求求你了
Please. I'm begging you, please.

114

Please. Please!

116
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,580
小姐你好  我会讲英语  姜先生的翻译
Hello, miss. I speak English. I translate for Mr. Jang.

117
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,270
请告诉他我什么都没有做
Please tell him that I haven't done anything.

118
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,590
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

119
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,260
这完全是场误会  请你告诉他
It's all just a big mistake, okay? Please tell him that.

120
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,430
好的  可以  稍等
Yes, okay, okay. Hold on.

121
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,900
姜先生想知道箱子里是什么
Mr. Jang wants to know what's in the case.

122
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,530
我也不知道里面是什么
No, I don't know what's in the case.

123
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,570
你到底懂不懂英语
Do you speak English or don't you speak English?

124
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,020
当然懂
Yes, I do.

125
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,610
我在纽约国际中学读过一年
I studied one year at International High School in New York.

126
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
好吧
Okay.

127
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,870
理查德让我把箱子给你  我就知道这么多
Richard gave me the case to give to you, that's all I know.

128
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,960
请你告诉他好吗
Okay? Please tell him that.

129
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,060
他给我一张写有数字的纸
He gave me a paper with numbers written on it.

130
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,610
我不...这是什么
I don't... what is this?

131
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,110
开箱子的密码
It's the code to open the case.

132
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,790
-里面究竟有什么  -不是危险品
- What's really in here? - Nothing dangerous.

133
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,670
那他怎么不自己打开
So why won't he open it himself?

134
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,010
他信不过理查德先生
He doesn't trust Mr. Richard.

135
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,180
我也信不过理查德  我们约会才一周
I don't trust Richard, either. I only dated him for a week.

136
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,520
行  行  我开
Okay, okay, okay.

137
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,440
-姜一定要你开箱子  -好的  我开
- Mr. Jang insists that you open the case. - Okay, okay.

138
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,530
上帝保佑
Please, God, help me.

139
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,040
他要你动作快点  姜先生还有事要做
He wants you to hurry up. Mr. Jang has other things to do.

140
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,410
能描述一下里面的东西吗
Can you describe the contents of the case?

141
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,370
有四个塑料袋  装着蓝色粉末  像...
It's four plastic pouches filled with a blue powder. Like a...

142
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,920
又像紫色的  我也说不清  反正很恶心
Maybe a purple powder. I don't know. It looks gross.

143
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,060
姜先生给你个活儿干
Mr. Jang wants to offer you a job.

144
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,810
活儿
A job?

145
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,530
我不要干什么活儿
I don't want a job.

146
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,950
如果生命始于约十亿年前
If life starts approximately a billion years ago,

147
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,480
那我们得等四十万年
we will have to wait 400,000 years

148
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,830
才能看到第一批神经细胞的畸变
to see the aberration of the first nerve cells.

149
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,540
这就是我们所说的生命起点
This is where life as we know it begins.

150
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,840
大脑的雏形仅有几毫克重
Brains in formation of only a few milligrams.

151
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,430
是否拥有智慧尚无从判断
It's not possible to determine any sign of intelligence yet.

152
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,050
其表现更像某种反射
It acts more as a reflex.

153
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,850
一个神经元意味着生命
One neuron, you're alive.

154
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,890
两个神经元意味着行为
Two neurons, you're moving,

155
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,440
有了行为便会发生各种有趣的事
and with movement, interesting things begin to happen.

156
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,410
数百万年前  地球上出现了动物
Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.

157
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,870
然而大多数物种的大脑只开发了3%至5%
Yet most species only use 3 to 5% of its cerebral capacity.

158
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,950
直到我们进化为人类
But it isn't until we reached

159
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,870
登上食物链的顶端
human beings at the top of the animal chain

160
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,670
我们才得以见识一个利用更多脑容量的物种
that we finally see a species use more of its cerebral capacity.

161
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,480
10%看似不高
10% may not seem like much,

162
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,350
但看看人类藉此所得的成就  也不为少了
but it's a lot if you look at all we've done with it.

163
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
下面我们探讨一个特例
Now let's discuss a special case.

164
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,930
唯一一个大脑利用率优于我们的物种
The only living being that uses its brain better than us.

165
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,680
海豚
The dolphin.

166
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,180
据估计  这种不可思议的动物
It is estimated that this incredible animal

167
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,610
脑容量开发达到了20%
uses up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.

168
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,900
特别是其由此促生的回声定位系统
In particular, this allows it to have an echolocation system

169
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,990
它比人类发明的任何声纳设备更为高效
that is more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.

170
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,920
然而海豚并未发明声纳
But the dolphin did not invent the sonar,

171
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,710
它只是自然演化而来
it developed it naturally.

172
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,450
这就是现今哲学反思中
And this is the crucial part

173
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,710
最为关键之处
of our philosophical reflection we have today.

174
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,380
我们能否就此得出结论
Can we therefore conclude thatwith

175
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,350
即人类更看重后天拥有  而非与生俱来呢
humans are concerned more with having... than being?

176
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,490
露西
Lucy.

177
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,120
你们把我肚子怎么了
What did you do to my stomach?

178
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,770
没什么  只是个小型横切术
Nothing! Just a little horizontal slit.

179
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,040
非常成功  而且...
It's very well done. And...

180
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,170
不出一个月你就看不出疤痕了
You'll find within a month, the scar is practically invisible.

181
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,520
等到明年夏天
So, you'll be able to

182
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,760
你就可以去海滩秀身材了
show your tummy off on the beach next summer.

183
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,800
我不在乎疤痕
I don't care about the scar.

184
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,300
是想知道为什么给你开刀吗
Is it, uh... is it why we opened you up?

185
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,730
放宽心  我们没有取走你的器官
Rest assured, we didn't harvest your organs or anything.

186
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,440
只是在你腹部缝入一小包东西
We merely slipped a little package into your lower tummy.

187
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,100
是种...新型毒品
It's a... it's a new drug

188
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,320
欧洲小青年会喜欢的  相信我
that kids in Europe are going to love, believe me.

189
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,610
-那是什么  -学名称作CPH4
- What is it? - Well, the scientific term is C.P.H.4.

190
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,780
从营销角度来说这名字可不吸引人
Which is not very sexy from a sales point of view.

191
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,860
所以我们还在酝酿
So we're still working on

192
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,580
更为时髦的名字  有建议吗
something with a bit more pop. Any suggestions?

193
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,250
请稍等
Excuse me.

194
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,090
欢迎  欢迎  请进  真不错
Welcome! Welcome, come on in. Lovely! Oops!

195
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,930
好极了  好极了
Splendid, splendid!

196
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
非常好  很好  很好
Marvelous! Lovely, lovely.

197
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,390
-你好吗  -很好  亲爱的
- How are you? - Very good, my dear.

198
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,270
太好了
Okay.

199
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,940
好  首先
Right. First of all,

200
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,810
非常感谢各位参与这项计划
many thanks for taking part in this enterprise,

201
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,510
我保证其天衣无缝
which I'm sure will go off flawlessly.

202
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,820
这些护照和机票
These lovely passports and tickets

203
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,450
将带领你们回家
will enable you to return home in the next 24 hours.

204
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,580
等落地之后  我们的人会接走你们
Now, upon arrival, you will be taken in hand by our people,

205
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,040
这样我们才好取回货物
so that we might recover our merchandise

206
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,120
你们也将理所当然地重获自由
and you might rediscover the freedom which you so richly deserve.

207
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,880
想必不用我提醒各位
I'm sure I don't need to remind you,

208
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,210
不过哪位企图动歪脑筋
but for any of those who may be tempted

209
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,430
企图报警或者自首
to warn or turn themselves in to the authorities,

210
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,860
我们手上可有
we have the names and

211
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,220
各位家人的姓名和地址
addresses of the families of every one of you,

212
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,350
包括那些远房的亲戚
down to the most distant cousins, right?

213
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,570
那么我们全仰仗各位谨慎行事了
So, we rely, therefore, on your complete discretion.

214
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,010
很好  先生们  还有女士
Good! Anyway, gentlemen, madam,

215
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,410
请允许我首先祝各位  一路顺风
allow me to be the first to wish you... bon voyage!

216
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,080
很好
Lovely.

217
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,880
-你要卖这个吗  -这是我们的商业模式
- You're gonna sell this? - I'm afraid it's our business model.

218
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,200
对于我们这样的原始生物
For primitive beings like us,

219
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,430
生命似乎只有唯一的目的
life seems to have only one single purpose,

220
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,930
获得时间
gaining time.

221
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,270
穿越时间长河似乎也是
And it is going through time that seems to be also

222
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,730
我们体内每个细胞的唯一真正目的
the only real purpose of each of the cells in our bodies.

223
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,900
为实现这一目标
To achieve that aim, the mass of the cells

224
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,490
构成蚯蚓以及人体的大量细胞只有两个选择
that make up earthworms and human beings has only two solutions.

225
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,080
永生  抑或繁衍
Be immortal... or to reproduce.

226
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,460
如果生存环境不利于繁衍
If its habitat is not sufficiently favorable or nurturing...

227
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,090
细胞会选择永生
The cell will choose immortality.

228
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,430
即自给自足和自我管理
In other words, self-sufficiency and self-management.

229
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,260
反之  如果生存环境允许
On the other hand, if the habitat is favorable...

230
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,310
它们将选择繁衍
they will choose to reproduce.

231
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,280
这样  细胞死亡时
That way, when they die,

232
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,790
会将必须的信息和知识传递给下一代
they hand down essential information and knowledge

233
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,250
下一代传给再下一代  以此类推
to the next cell, which hands it down to the next cell and so on.

234
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,430
于是知识便经由时间传承下去
Thus, knowledge and learning are handed down through time.

235
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,940
好了  冷静点  你必须等待  拖延时间
Okay, okay. Keep calm. You have to wait. Just play for time.

236
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,030
登机后就有时间思考了
You'll have time to think it through on the plane.

237
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,860
先上飞机
Just take the flight.

238
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,670
先上飞机  离开这里
Take the flight, get out of here.

239
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,150
这是当务之急  争取时间
That's the main thing right now. Just save time.

240
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,200
不要轻举妄动  保持冷静  你还活着
Don't try anything. Keep your cool. You're alive.

241
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,150
你还活着  你还活着
You're alive, babe. You're alive.

242
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,120
这才是最重要的  等待
That's all that matters. Just wait.

243
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,660
争取时间
Save time.

244
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,410
争取时间
Save time.

245
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,300
怎样 有没有什么感觉啊

246
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,090
长得是不错啊

247
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,150
长得蛮漂亮的

248
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,580
要不要玩一玩啊

249
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,550
走啦  走啦

250
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,460
唉呀 别闹了啦

251
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,570
我没心情
I'm not in the mood.

252
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,150
婊子 打你啊

253
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,830
流血了

254
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,730
不要打了

255
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,150
想象一下
Let's imagine for a few moments

256
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,860
如果能将大脑开发至20%  我们的生活
what our life would be like if we could access, let's say,

257
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,080
又将变成什么样
20% of our brain's capacity.

258
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,580
第一阶段我们可以自如地控制身体
This first stage would give us access to and control of our own body.

259
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,750
-教授  -请说
- Sir? - Yes.

260
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,750
这有被科学验证过吗
Has it been proved scientifically?

261
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,310
我承认  直至目前仍是假设
For the moment, it's just hypothesis, I confess.

262
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,700
不过细想一下
But if you think about it,

263
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,650
很难解释
it's troubling to realize that

264
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,870
为何在显微镜发明之前
the Greeks, the Egyptians and the Indians

265
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,380
希腊人  埃及人和印第安人
had notion of cells centuries

266
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,140
就已经有了细胞的概念
before the invention of the microscope.

267
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,420
更不用说  达尔文当初
And what to say about Darwin, whom everybody took for a fool

268
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,570
提出进化论时还被当成傻子
when he put forth his theory of evolution.

269
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,190
法律与规则靠人类来推进
It's up to us to push the rules and laws,

270
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,910
从演进走向革命也是一样
and go from evolution to revolution.

271
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:03,210
人体一千亿个神经元中只激活了15%
100 billion neurons per human, of which only 15% are activated.

272
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,870
人体内神经元之间的联结
There are more connections in the human body

273
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,960
比星系中的星星还多
than there are stars in the galaxy.

274
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,650
我们拥有一张无从下手的
We possess a gigantic network of information

275
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,180
庞大信息网络
to which we have almost no access.

276
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,220
-教授  -请说
- Sir? - Yes.

277
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,100
那下一阶段是什么
And what will be the next stage?

278
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,730
下一阶段是能够控制其他人
Well, the next stage would probably be control of other people.

279
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,400
为此
But for that,

280
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,440
大脑至少要开发到40%
we would need to access at least 40% of our brain's capacity.

281
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,970
能够控制自己和他人后
After control of ourselves and others

282
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,740
接下来是控制物质
would come control of matter.

283
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,950
但自此就进入到科幻小说的领域了
But now we're entering into the realm of science fiction,

284
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,950
对此我们就好比小狗看月亮一样无知
and we don't know any more than a dog who watches the moon.

285
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,000
-教授  -请说
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes.

286
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,590
如果出于某些我们没注意到的原因
But what would happen if, for some reason we ignore,

287
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,130
有人将其大脑开发到100%了呢
somebody unlocked 100% of their cerebral capacity?

288
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,390
-100%吗  -是的
- 100%? - Yes.

289
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,140
我也不知道
I have no idea.

290
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,180
-你会说英语吗  -不会  我不会
- Hey! You speak English? - No, no, no.

291
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,850
-你呢  -会  我会
- You speak English? - Yes, yes.

292
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,810
-送我去医院  -医院
- Take me to the hospital now. - Hospital.

293
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,480
我的腿
My leg!

294
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,210
三军总医院

295
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,570
-医院  -在这等我
- Hospital! - Wait for me.

296
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,290
这位女士
Miss! Hello?

297
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,500
这位女士
Hey! Miss!

298
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,920
我需要帮助  情况紧急
I need help. It's urgent.

299
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,870
你不能在这里  我们在做手术
You cannot be in here. We are operating!

300
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,090
请你出去
Please, get out!

301
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,190
反正你也救不活他
You wouldn't have been able to save him anyway.

302
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,350
肿瘤已扩散至大脑皮层
The tumor had already invaded the cortex

303
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,380
和右侧脊椎
and the right side of his spine.

304
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,050
有人在我体内放了一包毒品
Somebody put a bag of drugs in me.

305
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,950
你帮我拿出来  包装已经漏了
I need you to remove it. It's leaking.

306
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,120
现在就开始
Do it now.

307
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,130
好的  我先给你局部麻醉
Right. I'll just administer a local anesthetic.

308
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,630
不用了
Don't bother.

309
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,050
好的  好的
Right. Okay.

310
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,300
冷静点  先把枪放下
Calm down, please. Put the gun down.

311
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,810
我先检查一下  好吗
I'm just going to examine, okay?

312
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,980
-手机借我一下  -好的
- Do you mind? - No.

313
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,950
-喂  -妈
- Hello? - Mom?

314
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,950
露西
Hey! Lucy.

315
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,620
宝贝  接到你的电话妈妈真高兴
Baby, it's great to hear from you!

316
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,950
你那里几点了
But what time is it over there?

317
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,710
不知道  晚上了
I don't know, it's night.

318
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,830
等会儿  我先挂掉其他电话
Hold on a sec, let me get rid of the other line.

319
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,290
准备开始手术了
I'm going to have to go inside.

320
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,130
好了  你没有经常跑出去玩吧
I'm back. You're not partying too much, are you?

321
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,760
你跟我保证过会好好照顾自己的
You promised me you'd look after yourself.

322
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,470
我有在努力  妈妈  我有在努力
I'm trying to, Mom. I am trying to.

323
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,430
怎么突然就来电话了
Well, thanks for calling out of the blue like this.

324
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,730
你爸爸肯定会很伤心  他很想你
Your father's gonna be sad, he missed you.

325
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,390
他去健身了还没回来
He isn't home from the gym yet.

326
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,110
平时你都是早上打给我们的
Usually, you call us in the morning.

327
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,360
-妈  -怎么了
- Mom? - Yes?

328
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,690
我能感受到一切
I feel everything.

329
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,530
什么意思  亲爱的
What do you mean, sweetie?

330
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,870
太空
Space,

331
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,430
空气
the air,

332
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,250
振动
the vibrations,

333
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,380
人
the people.

334
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,880
我能感受到地心引力
I can feel the gravity.

335
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,970
我能感受到地球在转动
I can feel the rotation of the Earth,

336
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,930
我体内流失的热量
the heat leaving my body,

337
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,060
血管中的血液
the blood in my veins.

338
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,060
我能感受到自己的大脑
I can feel my brain,

339
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,190
最深处的记忆
the deepest parts of my memory.

340
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,110
亲爱的  信号不太好  我听不太清
Sweetie, we have a bad connection. I can't hear you so well.

341
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,320
你说什么记忆来着
What did you say about memory?

342
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,750
箍牙时嘴里的疼痛
The pain in my mouth when I had braces.

343
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,110
我记得发烧时
I can remember the feeling of your hand

344
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,130
你用手摸我的额头
on my forehead when I ran a fever.

345
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,090
我记得摸着猫咪  柔软的感觉
I remember stroking the cat, it was so soft.

346
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,930
猫咪  哪来的猫咪  亲爱的
The cat? What cat, honey?

347
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,760
蓝眼的断尾暹罗猫
A Siamese with blue eyes and a broken tail.

348
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,550
亲爱的  你不可能还记得
Sweetie, you can't possibly remember that.

349
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,270
那时你还不到一岁
You were barely a year old.

350
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,530
我还记得母乳的味道
I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth.

351
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,560
我能感受到你的子宫
The room,

352
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,610
液体...
the liquid...

353
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,540
亲爱的  你在说什么
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

354
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,870
我只想告诉你们  我爱你们
I just wanna tell you that I love you, Mom and Dad.

355
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,210
亲爱的
Sweetie...

356
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,450
我想谢谢你的无数个吻
And I wanna thank you for the thousand kisses

357
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,760
我脸上还能感受到
that I can still feel on my face.

358
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,050
我爱你  妈妈
I love you, Mom.

359
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,140
我也爱你  亲爱的  妈妈爱你胜过一切
I love you, too, sweetie. More than anything in the world.

360
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,650
还剩多少
How much is left?

361
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,200
五百克
500 grams.

362
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,870
我的身体要多久才能清掉剩余的部分
And how long will it take my body to eliminate the rest of it?

363
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,880
在回答你之前我需要知道这是什么  可以吗
To answer that, I need to know what it is. May I?

364
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,380
动手吧
Go ahead.

365
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,050
CPH4
C.P.H.4.

366
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,430
那是什么东西
Tell me about it.

367
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,230
孕妇在怀孕第六周
Pregnant women manufacture C.P.H.4

368
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,770
会释放出微量CPH4
in the sixth week of pregnancy in tiny quantities.

369
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,600
对婴儿而言
For a baby,

370
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,480
里面蕴含着原子弹般的能量
it packs the power of an atomic bomb.

371
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,830
它给予胎儿所有骨骼生长
It's what gives the fetus the necessary energy

372
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,780
所必需的能量
to form all the bones in its body.

373
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,530
我听说过有人在尝试制造它
I'd heard they tried to make a synthetic version of it.

374
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,490
但没想到居然成功了
I didn't realize that they'd succeeded.

375
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,790
如果这真是CPH4
If it really is C.P.H.4,

376
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,510
以这个量来说
in this quantity,

377
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,620
你活着也算是奇迹了
I'm amazed you're still alive.

378
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,130
活不久了
Not for long.

379
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,420
学习的过程是痛苦的
Learning's always a painful process.

380
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,180
就像你小时候
Like when you're little

381
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,470
长骨头时的全身疼痛
and your bones are growing and you ache all over.

382
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,350
你能相信我还记得自己长骨头时的声音吗
Can you believe I can remember the sound of my own bones growing?

383
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,880
就像皮肤底下有东西在摩擦
Like this grinding under the skin.

384
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,980
不过现在不一样了
Everything's different now.

385
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,690
它就像是我听得懂的音乐  像是羊水
Like, sounds are music that I can understand, like fluids.

386
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,740
真有趣  过去我常常想知道自己是谁
It's funny, I used to be so concerned with who I was

387
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,530
以后想要做什么
and what I wanted to be,

388
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,540
现在我可以抵达大脑的最深处
and now that I have access to the furthest reaches of my brain,

389
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,050
看得很透彻
I see things clearly

390
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,160
意识到人类的原始性
and realize that what makes us us... it's primitive.

391
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:22,210
其实全是障碍  这么说你明白吗
They're all obstacles. Does that make any sense?

392
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,390
就像现在你感受到的痛楚
Like this pain you're experiencing.

393
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,880
它在阻碍你理解
It's blocking you from understanding.

394
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,850
你所感知到的都只是疼痛
All you know now is pain. That's all you know, pain.

395
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,100
其他人呢
Where are the others?

396
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,890
其他运送毒品的人呢
The others carrying the drugs.

397
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,730
我需要剩余的毒品作医疗之用
I need the rest of it, for medicinal purposes.

398
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,350
柏林
Berlin.

399
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,600
巴黎
Paris.

400
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,450
罗马
Rome.

401
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,580
感谢分享
Thank you for sharing.

402
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,640
晚上好  教授
Oh. Evening, Professor.

403
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,300
晚上好  艾伯特
Bonsoir, Albert.

404
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,950
今晚需要为您准备晚餐吗
Do we have you for dinner tonight?

405
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,850
是的  我太累了
I'm afraid so. I'm exhausted.

406
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,100
-好好休息  -谢谢
- Have a good rest. - Thank you.

407
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,470
你吓死我了
You scared the shit out of me,

408
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,570
敲门敲得跟个疯子似的
ringing that bell like some nutbar!

409
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,030
好想你
I missed you.

410
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,620
我也是
Me, too.

411
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,740
-你钥匙掉了吗  -是的
- Yeah, you lose your keys or something? - Yeah.

412
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,370
-电脑借我用一下好吗  -好啊
- Can I borrow your laptop? - Yeah, of course.

413
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,290
昨天一整天我都在试镜  棒极了
So I spent all of yesterday in auditions, which are awesome.

414
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,210
他们就让你整天闲坐在那里
They just have you standing around all day,

415
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,750
也不管你有没时间
because they don't give a shit about your time,

416
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,550
就用中文说个没完
gabbing away in Chinese.

417
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,630
谁懂中文  反正我不懂
Who understands Chinese? I don't understand Chinese.

418
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,510
他们说会打给你的  但从来都不会打
And then they say they're always gonna call, and they never do,

419
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,660
因为他们都没记你的号码  你知道吗
because they don't even take your phone number. You know?

420
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,600
除了一个人  不过他不是中国人
Except this one guy, but he's not Chinese.

421
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,480
他在经纪公司上班  长得很帅
He works at the agency and he's cute.

422
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,760
我的天  长得超帅
Oh, my God, he's cute.

423
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,110
就是"我也知道自己很帅"的那种帅
In the cute-and-I-kinda-know-it kinda way.

424
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,570
就好像他有...天啊  他的屁股
Like he had this thing... Oh, my God, and his ass!

425
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,900
一提到他的屁股我就停不下来
Let me get started on that!

426
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,660
你绝对猜不到他带我去哪了
And you are never gonna guess where he took me.

427
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,950
四季酒店  皇家套房  我们做了整晚
Four Seasons, Royal Suites, and we made love all night.

428
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,140
抱歉  我都在说自己
I'm sorry, I'm talking about myself.

429
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,120
你怎么样  理查德呢
What's up? How's Richard?

430
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,500
他死了
He's dead.

431
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,420
你们都疯了  我先去洗个澡
You guys are crazy. I'm gonna take a shower.

432
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,890
-你好  -诺曼教授  我叫露西
- Yes? - Professor Norman, my name's Lucy.

433
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,560
我刚看完你所有关于大脑的研究
I just read all your research on the human brain.

434
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,020
我们得见个面
We need to meet.

435
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,650
我所有研究吗  我很受宠若惊  小姐
All of my research? Well, I'm very flattered, young lady,

436
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,400
但这太不可能
but I find that hard to believe.

437
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
我写了起码有...
I must have written no less than...

438
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,400
6734页
6,734 pages.

439
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,700
需要的话  我可以背给你听
I can recite them to you all by heart, if you wish.

440
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,290
你是埃米莉的朋友吗
Are you one of Emily's friends?

441
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,900
听上去像是她开的傻玩笑
This sounds like one of her silly jokes.

442
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,130
她跟你在一起吗
Is she there with you?

443
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,250
不  我就一个人
No, I'm all on my own.

444
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,930
-你是谁  -我刚告诉过你了
- Who are you? - I just told you.

445
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,220
露西  是吗  抱歉
Lucy, right? Yes, sorry.

446
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,810
我读了你关于大脑开发的研究
I read your theory on the use of the brain's capacity.

447
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,020
还不是很成熟  不过方向是对的
It's a little rudimentary, but you're on the right track.

448
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,810
谢谢
Thank you.

449
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,190
教授  我的细胞正以惊人的速度在繁殖
Professor, my cells are reproducing at a phenomenal speed.

450
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,780
每秒数百万个
Several million per second.

451
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,070
我现在无法准确计算出自己什么时候会死
I'm having trouble precisely evaluating the time of my death,

452
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,510
但恐怕不会超过24个小时
but I doubt I'll last more than 24 hours.

453
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,080
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

454
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,450
我想说的是你的理论不仅仅是理论
What I'm saying is that your theory is not a theory.

455
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,670
我吸收了大量的人造CPH4
I absorbed a large quantity of synthetic C.P.H.4.

456
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,960
它能让我的大脑开发到100%
That will allow me to use 100% of my cerebral capacity.

457
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,260
现在我的大脑开发到了28%
Right now, I'm at 28%,

458
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,590
你写的是对的
and what you wrote is true.

459
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,340
一旦大脑开发到20%就会继续扩张下去
Once the brain reaches 20%, it opens up and expands the rest.

460
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,390
障碍如同多米诺骨牌般倒下
There are no more obstacles.

461
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,430
不再有任何阻碍
They fall away like dominoes.

462
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,270
我在开拓自己的大脑
I'm colonizing my own brain.

463
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,320
我不知道该说什么
Well, I don't know what to... say.

464
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,490
确实  我研究这套理论超过20年了
It's true, I've been working on this theory for over 20 years,

465
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:04,160
不过都只是假设和一些研究性想法
but it's only ever been hypotheses and research ideas.

466
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,000
我从没想过会有人...
I never thought anyone would...

467
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,170
-你能控制自己的新陈代谢吗  -是的
- You can control your own metabolism? - Yes.

468
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,500
而且我开始可以控制别人的身体
And I can start to control other people's bodies.

469
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,550
还能控制磁波和电波
Also, I can control magnetic and electric waves.

470
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,640
并非所有  只能控制最基本的
Not all of them, just the most basic.

471
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,930
电视  电话
Television. Telephone.

472
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,750
收音机
Radio.

473
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,070
真不可思议
That's amazing.

474
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,900
我感受不到疼痛
I don't feel pain,

475
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,540
害怕
fear,

476
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,850
欲望
desire.

477
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,290
就像人性正在逐渐泯灭
It's like all things that make us human are fading away.

478
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,380
感觉越少人性
It's like the less human I feel,

479
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,170
对于万物的理解
all this knowledge about everything,

480
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,220
量子力学  应用数学
quantum physics, applied mathematics,

481
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,850
细胞核内蕴含的无限能量
the infinite capacity of a cell's nucleus.

482
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,350
感觉这些知识都在我脑子里面炸开了
They're all exploding inside my brain, all this knowledge.

483
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,190
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do with it.

484
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,900
要是你问我该怎么做
If you're asking me what to do...

485
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,330
你知道
You know,

486
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,630
如果你想想生命的本原
if you think about the very nature of life,

487
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,090
我的意思是  生命之初
I mean, from the very beginning,

488
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:47,600
从一个细胞分裂成两个细胞的进程
the development of the first cell that divided into two cells.

489
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:55,600
生命的唯一目的就是传递学到的知识
The sole purpose of life has been to pass on what was learned.

490
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,570
这是最高目标
There was no higher purpose.

491
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,400
所以如果你问我该怎么做
So if you're asking me what to do,

492
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,450
以你现在所获取到的知识  我建议你
with all this knowledge you're accumulating, I'd say,

493
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,830
传递下去
pass it on.

494
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:17,500
就跟每个单细胞一样去跨越时间
Just like any simple cell going through time.

495
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,130
时间
Time.

496
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,010
是啊
Yes, of course.

497
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,510
12小时内我会到你门口
I'll be at your door in 12 hours.

498
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,270
-你要走了吗  -是的
- You're leaving? - Yes.

499
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,030
-这是什么  -一张药方
- What is this? - A prescription.

500
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,910
你什么时候会写中文了
Since when did you start writing in Chinese?

501
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,060
一个小时前
Since an hour ago.

502
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,280
露西  我根本看不懂
Luce, I don't understand any of this.

503
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,020
你的肾不太好
Your kidneys aren't functioning efficiently,

504
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,950
肝也不行
your liver's failing you.

505
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,790
你需要改变一下生活方式
You need to make some lifestyle changes.

506
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,740
抓药吃  多锻炼  多吃有机食物
Take this medication, work out, eat organic.

507
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,170
你会好起来的
You'll be okay.

508
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,630
我是德·里奥
Del Rio.

509
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:40,950
我接到了一个奇怪的电话
I've got a weird call

510
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,500
是一个美国人从台湾打来的
from a US citizen in Taiwan.

511
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,670
是一名年轻女子
A young woman calling

512
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,090
向我们透露一个贩毒集团的消息
to tip us off about a big drugs ring.

513
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,260
-我来接  -我转给你
- I'll take it. - I'll tape you.

514
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,430
喂
Hello?

515
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,640
我知道一个贩毒集团的重要信息
I have important information about a group of drug traffickers.

516
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,180
我有话要跟你们的负责人说
I need to speak with someone in a position of authority.

517
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,640
那你找对人了
Aha. You're very lucky,

518
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,060
这里还没有谁比我说的算
there's no one with more authority in this office than me.

519
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,270
但是公事公办  您叫什么名字
But let's start at the beginning. What is your name?

520
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,380
听好了  皮埃尔·德·里奥
Listen up, Pierre Del Rio.

521
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,030
别坐在桌上了  坐椅子上去
Get off your desk, sit in your chair,

522
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,210
拿起你左手边的红笔
pick up the red pen to the left of you

523
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,990
把我说的每句话都记下来
and take down everything I say.

524
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,910
没人监控你  快点  别浪费我时间
There are no cameras. Hurry up! I've no time to waste.

525
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,880
说吧
Go ahead.

526
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,340
我要给你的是即将到达欧洲的
I'm gonna be sending you the details

527
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,380
三个人的详细信息
of three people about to arrive in Europe.

528
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:31,920
每个人都携带了一公斤的毒品
Each one is carrying a kilo of drugs.

529
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,350
我需要你逮捕他们
I need you to arrest them

530
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,450
缴获毒品
and collect the substance.

531
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,430
之后把毒品交给我
I'll need it for later.

532
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,560
毒品是什么样的  条形的  还是胶囊
What form are these drugs in? Bars? Capsules?

533
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,440
粉状的  藏在他们肠子里的塑料袋里
Powder. Hidden in plastic pouches inside their intestines.

534
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,560
什么
Excuse me?

535
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,350
你们取的时候务必要小心
Make sure to be careful when you remove them.

536
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,440
那玩意非常厉害
The product is very powerful.

537
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,620
相信我
Believe me.

538
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,660
-明白没  -明白了
- Got it? - Yeah.

539
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,330
很好
Good.

540
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,790
我就靠你了
I'm counting on you.

541
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,130
没事吧
Okay?

542
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,990
早上好
Good morning.

543
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:18,140
德国  柏林
早上好
Good morning.

544
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,340
德国  柏林

545

谢谢
Thank you.

That damn girl, she doesn't give in. She's a witch.

684
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,430
我知道
I know that.

685
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,940
我会亲手杀了她的
I'll kill her myself.

686
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,870
有人来了
There are men coming here.

687
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,780
你能守住这个房间吗  我需要专注
Can you secure the room? I need to stay focused.

688
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,990
当然
Sure.

689
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:00,870
快点
Speed it up.

690
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,300
你是怎么获取这些信息的
How did you manage to access all this information?

691
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,800
电子脉冲
Electrical impulses.

692
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,090
细胞与细胞互相了解并交流
Every cell knows and talks to every other cell.

693
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,370
他们每秒会交换
They exchange a thousand bits

694
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,510
1000比特的的信息
of information between them per second.

695
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,190
细胞聚合  形成一个巨大的交互网络
Cells group together, forming a giant web of communication,

696
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:26,730
然后形成了物质
which in turn forms matter.

697
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,730
细胞聚集  以某种特定外形呈现
Cells get together, take on one form,

698
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,230
然后又变形  重组
deform, reform.

699
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,900
本质上没有区别  都一样
Makes no difference, it's all the same.

700
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:38,100
人类觉得自己是一个独特的群体
Humans consider themselves unique,

701
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,010
从而将自己存在的理论建立在
so they've rooted their whole theory of existence

702
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,920
其独特性的基础之上
on their uniqueness.

703
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,910
他们的衡量单位是"一个"
"One" is their unit of measure.

704
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,280
事实并非如此
But it's not.

705
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,750
我们所建立的所有社会系统
All social systems we've put into place

706
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,540
都仅是一个草图
are a mere sketch.

707
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,170
一加一等于二  我们就学了这些
One plus one equals two. That's all we've learned.

708
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:54,340
但是一加一永远不等于二
But one plus one has never equaled two.

709
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,380
实际上  不存在数字和字母
There are, in fact, no numbers and no letters.

710
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:59,110
我们编译了自己的存在
We've codified our existence

711
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,050
将其局限于人类范畴
to bring it down to human size

712
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,100
从而使其易于理解
to make it comprehensible.

713
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,920
我们创造了自己的标准
We've created a scale

714
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,940
从而遗忘那些高深而权威的准则
so that we can forget its unfathomable scale.

715
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,690
但是如果人类不是衡量单位
But if humans are not the unit of measure

716
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,820
世界也不受数学定律支配
and the world isn't governed by mathematical laws,

717
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,320
那么这一切都由什么掌控
what governs all that?

718
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:24,570
假设有一辆汽车在路上高速行驶
Film a car speeding down a road.

719
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,950
再设想让它无限加速
Speed up the image infinitely

720
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,670
最终汽车就消失了
and the car disappears.

721
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,550
我们如何证明它的存在呢
So what proof do we have of its existence?

722
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,640
时间能够证明它的存在
Time gives legitimacy to its existence.

723
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,390
时间才是唯一的衡量单位
Time is the only true unit of measure.

724
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,640
时间能够证明物质的存在
It gives proof to the existence of matter.

725
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,640
没有时间
Without time,

726
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,980
我们也不复存在
we don't exist.

727
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,780
时间是唯一的
Time is unity.

728
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:07,020
搜索整栋楼  必须找到她
Search the whole building and find her!

729
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,210
我们撑不了多久了
We won't be able to hold them for much longer.

730
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,210
该开始了
Time to go then.

731
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,740
你确定你需要这么大的剂量
Are you sure you need such huge doses?

732
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,650
我恐怕你存活不了
I'm afraid you won't survive.

733
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,390
我体内的某些细胞会反抗
Some cells inside me will fight

734
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:36,780
维护其完整性  直到最后一刻
and defend their integrity till the very end.

735
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,250
为了获得最后的几个百分点
In order to attain the last few percent,

736
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:43,070
我必须迫使细胞向细胞核分裂
I have to force it to crack the cells open to their nucleus.

737
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,540
但是露西  所有这些知识
But all of this knowledge, Lucy...

738
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,050
我不认为人类现在应该得到它
I'm not even sure that mankind is ready for it.

739
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,050
我们早已权欲熏心
We're so driven by power and profit.

740
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,530
人类本性使然
Given man's nature,

741
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,600
这很可能只会给我们带来混乱与动荡
it might bring us only instability and chaos.

742
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:15,270
混乱是由无知带来的  不是知识
Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.

743
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,700
我会建一台电脑
I'll build a computer

744
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,570
把我所有的知识下载进去
and download all my knowledge in it.

745
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:21,740
我会告诉你该如何访问
I'll find a way for you to have access to it.

746
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,280
好的
Yeah.

747
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:27,280
我只是希望我们值得你这样牺牲
I just hope we will be worthy of your sacrifice.

748
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,800
都别动
Nobody move!

749
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,270
你懂英语吗
Do you understand English?

750
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,590
她在干什么
What is she doing?

751
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:04,130
她在寻找能量和物质
She's looking for energy and matter.

752
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,760
她在连接我们的电脑
And she's trying to connect with our computers.

753
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:54,220
-庄菊  -老大  我在这儿
- Chong-Ju! - I'm here, boss.

754
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:58,020
-想办法解决他们  -是  老大
- Do something about them. - Okay, boss!

755
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,690
你们  快点
You guys, come on.

756
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,570
准备好了吗
Ready?

757
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,480
你还好吧
You okay?

758
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,360
找个医生来  快
Get a medic. Fast!

759
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,700
我的上帝  这是怎么回事
Oh, my God. What's happening?

760
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,840
-她在制造什么  -我想是新一代电脑
- What is she making? - New generation computer, I presume.

761
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,520
她去哪儿了
Where is she?

762
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:59,770
她去哪儿了  回答我
Where is she? Answer me.

763
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:01,900
回答我
Answer me!

764
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,400
叫你呢
Hey, you!

765
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,670
看  那台电脑在动
Look. The computer, it's moving.

766
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:52,330
她去哪了
Hey. Where is she?

767
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,970
我无处不在

768
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,900
生命诞生于十亿年前
Life was given to us a billion years ago.

769
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:27,530
你现在知道该如何利用它了
Now you know what to do with it.
