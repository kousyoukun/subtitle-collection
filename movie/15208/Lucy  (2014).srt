
359
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:40,987
I just got a weird call
of an American in Taiwan.

360
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,227
A young woman says she details
has a major drug trafficking.

361
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:46,832
Take the call.
- I will.


375
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:05,258
Everything good?

376
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:29,372
That's him.
Hold him.

377
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:39,592
Would you come with me.

378
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:05,644
Sir, are you American?
Would you come with me.

379
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:34,435
Sir, would you come with me.

380
00:51:36,272 --> 00:51:38,075
Go after him.

381
00:51:52,803 --> 00:51:52,839
Del Rio.

382
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:56,111
Captain Marco Brezzi.

383
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:57,755
The package has been delivered.


385
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:05,597
There were three.

402
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:17,748
Did she have a scar?
- Yeah, just like that other girl.

403
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,887
How is she?
- She sleeps for the first time.

404
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,228
With the injection I gave,
she sleeps for a while.

405
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:08,584
Doctor, she's awake again.
- Are you sure?

406
00:56:08,617 --> 00:56:11,523
Yes, she sat on her bed.

407
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,268
That's her.
- Are you sure?


414
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,060
Leave the car there.


422
00:58:48,769 --> 00:58:54,015
It's good.
- Come on.

423
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,129
- There's the police.


425
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:09,448
I go to surgery.
- Take your drink with you.

431
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:15,097
Calm.


434
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:59,774
Kill her and grab the bag.

435
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:18,344
Do not stand there.
Kill her.

441
01:05:27,734 --> 01:05:30,580
No, that way.

442
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:34,885
Follow that car.

443
01:05:37,891 --> 01:05:39,727
Professor?
- Thanks.


464
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:28,809
Boss, there are five men in the hospital.
- How many are left?

465
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:31,307
I have 25 with me.

466
01:07:32,308 --> 01:07:35,975
That damn girl.
She does not give up. She's a witch.


468
01:07:58,004 --> 01:08:00,843
Faster.

509
01:13:50,143 --> 01:13:54,842
I'm boss here.
- Do something about them.

510
01:13:54,843 --> 01:13:56,769
Well, boss.

511
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,741
Come on, guys.

512
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,713
That way.
Fast.


515
01:20:50,181 --> 01:20:52,054
Where is she?
