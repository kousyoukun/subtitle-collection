1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:30,488
In 1855, England and France
were at war with Russia in the Crimea.

2
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,242
The English troops were paid in gold.

3
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:39,874
Once a month £25,000 in gold
was loaded into strongboxes

4
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,669
inside the London bank
of Huddleston and Bradford

5
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:47,631
and taken by trusted armed guards
to the railway station.

6
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:52,053
The convoy followed
no fixed route or timetable.

7
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:58,350
The gold was loaded into the
luggage van of the Folkestone train

8
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:02,313
for shipment to the coast
and from there to the Crimea.

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:06,734
The strongboxes
were placed in two Chubb safes

10
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,654
constructed of
three-quarter-inch tempered steel.

11
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,075
Each safe weighed 550 pounds.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,871
Each safe was fitted with two locks
requiring two keys,

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,083
or four keys altogether.

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,547
For security,
each key was individually protected.

15
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:34,345
Two keys were entrusted to the railway
dispatcher, who kept them in his office.

16
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,973
A third was in the custody of
Mr Edgar Trent,

17
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,268
president of the Huddleston and Bradford.

18
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,688
And the fourth key
was given to Mr Henry Fowler,

19
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,900
manager of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank.

20
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,195
The presence of so much gold
in one place

21
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,199
aroused the interests
of the English criminal elements,

22
00:01:55,282 --> 00:02:01,997
but in 1855 there had never been
a robbery from a moving railway train.

23
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,188
Is he dead?

24
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:46,453
Robbery? I'd hardly call it that -
one poor fellow working alone.

25
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,664
He had no chance of success.

26
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,875
Indeed, speaking on behalf of the bank,

27
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:58,048
I must inform you the matter was trivial
and hardly worthy of our consideration.

28
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,968
I think I may say that
without fear of contradiction.

29
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,845
The villain expired?

30
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,390
Quite. The guard threw him
from the train at full speed.

31
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,684
He died instantly. Poor devil.

32
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,396
- He's not been identified?
- I shouldn't think so.

33
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,192
The manner of his passing was such
that his features were... disarrayed.

34
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,820
He was obviously after the Crimean gold.

35
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,906
- Apparently. Speaking...
- This damnable war

36
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,327
- will be the undoing of the nation.
- He's off again.

37
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,080
Unrest in the north, and now this
ill-considered war with the Tsar.

38
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,751
What do you expect
when one man in seven has the vote?

39
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,503
We have shopkeepers voting now.

40
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,798
And women next. If they get their way.

41
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,344
Women voting. Really!

42
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,765
- This robbery had interesting...
- They haven't the capacity for logic.

43
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:52,519
- Too emotional. Quite absurd.
- It's not their logical capacity I enjoy.

44
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:57,649
- Even a good woman's too much trouble.
- Come, Arthur, they do have their uses.

45
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,111
Edward's got the proper view
by not marrying at all.

46
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,738
Someone will catch him.

47
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,408
- I know one or two with their eye on him.
- No one will catch Edward.

48
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:10,412
God knows what a man may catch
in London if he's not married.

49
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:14,917
This thief on the train, Henry.
Was there a risk of him stealing the gold?

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,296
- None. Quite impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

51
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,303
Utterly impossible. Two Chubb safes,
four keys separately guarded. Impossible.

52
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,182
- Still, I suppose it could be done.
- I can't imagine how.

53
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:34,561
A thief would have to get all four keys.
Two are locked away in the station.

54
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:39,900
One is in the hands of our president,
Mr Edgar Trent, who is utterly reliable.

55
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,904
I don't know where Mr Trent
keeps his key but I know of the fourth,

56
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,783
for I am myself entrusted with guarding it.

57
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,413
Damn it, Henry, when are you going to
tell us where you've hidden your key?

58
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:56,542
I keep it about my neck.
I wear it at all times.

59
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,293
Even when bathing?

60
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,797
Even while bathing.
It never leaves my person.

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,383
- Clever.
- Most ingenious.

62
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,679
So you see, to get all four keys -
quite impossible.

63
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:13,892
The Crimean gold and all the bank's
other transactions are entirely safe.

64
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,019
Thank God for that.

65
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,022
You may count on it, Edward. Count on it.

66
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:25,904
- Who do those men think you are?
- Edward Pierce. A sharp businessman.

67
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:30,159
A sharp businessman?
That covers a multitude of sins.

68
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,327
It does among that group.

69
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,831
And what's your business?

70
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:41,962
It's not really clear. I've made a great deal
of money in coal, in the north.

71
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,008
- Have you?
- Oh, yes, I have. I'm quite well-off.

72
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,342
Are you?

73
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:52,723
I think so.
I've... made something of myself.

74
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,892
Do they believe all that?

75
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,523
Among sharp businessmen
one doesn't ask too many questions.

76
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,903
Do they know of your interest
in the theatre?

77
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,614
An unmarried gentleman
must amuse himself.

78
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,659
- Must he?
- Oh, yes, he must.

79
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,580
Did they mention the train?

80
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,169
What did they say?

81
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,506
They all agreed that it was impossible.

82
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,550
Simply impossible.

83
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,136
You like that?

84
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,693
I can tell it excites you.

85
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,668
Are you all right?

86
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,062
Nice pull.

87
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,903
Not bad, if I do say so myself.
You look well.

88
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,030
Yes. How was the touch?

89
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,115
You saw it, didn't you?

90
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,785
Or was I so fast you couldn't see it?

91
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,997
I saw.

92
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,125
- Did you wire her?
- No, just my hands.

93
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,544
Hummingbirds.

94
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:17,344
- Thinking of a job, then?
- I may have one or two little things.

95
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:25,143
Those one or two little things...
Could they be crib jobs?

96
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,436
They could.

97
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,106
- Bit dicey, are they?
- Very dicey.

98
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,733
- Is it dipping or keys?
- Keys.

99
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,195
- Wax or a straightaway haul?
- Wax.

100
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,157
You didn't do the Berkeley Hills job,
did you?

101
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,785
Berkeley Hills? Shit job.

102
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:46,039
A shit job? Well, they're clean
with 2,000 guineas gone.

103
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,251
No. I was thinking of something bigger.

104
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,090
This wax. On the fly?

105
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,551
Then I'm your man.

106
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,263
- The fastest screwsman you'll ever see.
- So I heard.

107
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,183
- What's it to be, then?
- First we must case a square-rigged gent.

108
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,937
Good night.

109
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,106
Mr Edgar Trent,

110
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,860
president of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank,

111
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,529
follows an inflexible routine,

112
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,992
departing the bank
at the end of each day promptly at 7pm.

113
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,513
Mr Trent resides at
number seven Belgrave Square.

114
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:48,226
It's a mansion of 23 rooms,
not including servants' quarters.

115
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,272
His second wife, Emily,
is 30 years his junior,

116
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:59,321
and with her unmarried stepdaughter
she runs the household very strictly.

117
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,702
There are ten servants employed.

118
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:11,249
A coachman, a gardener, a doorman,
a butler, a cook and two upstairs maids.

119
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,336
All the servants are content
and can't be bribed.

120
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,257
- Dogs?
- Two. Terriers. Walks 'em twice a day.

121
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,511
Seven in the morning and 8.15 at night.

122
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,597
- Children?
- Five.

123
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,810
Three at home.
The youngest is a boy who sleepwalks.

124
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,103
Which creates a commotion.

125
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,787
No point in cracking a 23-room house
until we find out where the key is.

126
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,499
The person who knows
where that key is is Mr Trent.

127
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,378
Really?

128
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:03,969
He must have a weakness.
Gambling, drink. Women?

129
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,013
Well, hello.

130
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,522
No,no,no.

131
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,242
No respectable gentleman
is that respectable.

132
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,695
- He's a ratting gent.
- Indeed he is.

133
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,792
Thank you, gentlemen, please.
Mind your back there, sir.

134
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,462
Thank you. Excuse me, sir.

135
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,506
Nothing but the finest, gentlemen.

136
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:29,429
Every one country-born and bred,
not a water ditch among 'em.

137
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,725
Who wants to try a rat?
Come on, gents. Who wants to try a rat?

138
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,686
15 of your best for my fancy.

139
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:41,983
Weigh the fancy of Mr T.
A very sporting gentleman.

140
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,988
Let Mr T's fancy dog through.
There you are.

141
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:52,994
- 14 pounds.
- 14 pounds is Mr T's fancy dog.

142
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,289
And he's called for a try at 15 rats.

143
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,793
- Shall it be three minutes, Mr T?
- Yes.

144
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,965
Three minutes it is.
You may wager as you feel fit.

145
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,760
Get him his 15, Tom.

146
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,265
You win some, you lose some.

147
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,574
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

148
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,371
And... go!

149
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,581
Time, gentlemen. Three minutes.

150
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,918
Get the dog out. Thank you, gentlemen.

151
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,798
Pay your debts. Who's next?

152
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,093
Come on! Any man fancy his fancy?

153
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,597
A sporting chap.
You win one or two, you lose one or two.

154
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:42,187
Who's going to be next to try the finest
country-bred rats that money can buy?

155
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,820
May I join you?

156
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,698
If you like.

157
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:10,256
Lover wasn't at his best. He lacked bustle.
But he came up well enough.

158
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,718
- My Lover will fight again.
- Indeed.

159
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,846
And I shall wager upon him again
when he does.

160
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,141
- Did you lose much?
- Ten guineas. A trifle.

161
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,019
Ten guineas.

162
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,940
Well, I'm pleased you take it so lightly.

163
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,319
I admire a man
who may keep a fancy and sport him.

164
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,449
I should do so myself
were I not so often abroad on business.

165
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,370
Whenever I'm gone,
my wife looks after the animals.

166
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:45,792
I fear I've been too devoted to business
these past few years.

167
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,212
I've never married.

168
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,175
- Of course, I should like to.
- Of course.

169
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,722
It's so hard to meet a suitable girl.

170
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:15,780
- What exactly are you constructing?
- A water wheel. It will be so delightful.

171
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:21,661
Especially with the rusted curve of
the water wheel itself. Don't you agree?

172
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,957
We are building the rusted wheel
at considerable expense.

173
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,754
It is constructed of previously rusted
metal. The craftsmen are ingenious.

174
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:37,552
But we must wait for the weeds to grow
before it takes on the proper appearance.

175
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,346
Oh, I'm sure it'll be a handsome ruin.

176
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,348
Where is Elizabeth?

177
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,310
I have passed many pleasant hours here

178
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:49,939
watching the workmen
fit each piece into its precise slot.

179
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,942
Such skill.

180
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,695
They screw it together?

181
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:00,283
No, bolt it, actually, with long bolts.
Fitted tightly.

182
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,662
Yes. Long bolts, fitted tightly.

183
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:11,211
I've just returned from America,
a country of many prominent erections.

184
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,881
It is exciting to see things come together.

185
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,884
So long as the quality does not suffer.

186
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,554
Tight-fitting joints. That's the secret.

187
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,683
It is so rare these days.

188
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,980
It depends on the skill of the workman,
of course.

189
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,234
And he must have the proper tools.

190
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,403
My darling daughter.

191
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:42,325
Now may I present Mr Edward Pierce?
My daughter Elizabeth.

192
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,496
Miss Trent,
you've taken me completely by surprise.

193
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,290
I cannot tell if that's to my advantage.

194
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,918
I can assure you it is, wholly.

195
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,172
- Would you try one of these, Mr Pierce?
- With gratitude.

196
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,469
We are just discussing the ruins,
Elizabeth.

197
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:06,015
- It's coming along so nicely.
- That dreadful ruin. I can't bear it.

198
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,769
They've taken away so many flowers.

199
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,354
You're fond of flowers?

200
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,356
- More tea, Mr Pierce?
- Ah, yes.

201
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,694
Yes, I supervise the planting
of all the flowers in the garden.

202
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,612
What there is left of it.

203
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,448
I'm especially fond of the primroses.

204
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:23,866
Ah, yes.

205
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,244
Perhaps you'd like to see them?

206
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,621
I'd be delighted.

207
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,790
Will you excuse us?

208
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,877
It's quite rare
for a man to take an interest in flowers.

209
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,214
The best of them are just over here.
Let me show you.

210
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,634
I don't know that he's suitable for her.

211
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,221
- Oh, he seems nice enough.
- He has far too much to say.

212
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,350
We also have many daffodils.
They've just come up.

213
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:55,189
It gives me such pleasure to see beautiful
things spring forth. Don't you agree?

214
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,442
Yes, I do agree. But tell me...

215
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,910
He has his charm.

216
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,289
You don't care who she marries, do you?

217
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,460
Is she really plain?

218
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,254
That she is.

219
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,800
- And you find her tedious?
- Unbearably tedious.

220
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,638
- How does she wear her hair?
- On her head.

221
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,850
Really, I never noticed.

222
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,271
You're in a hurry.

223
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,440
I am a relentless suitor.

224
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,069
Besides, she still hasn't told me
what I need to know.

225
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,697
Where did you learn to ride?

226
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:48,993
- A lady never asks such a question.
- I'm serious.

227
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,245
France.

228
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,414
On an estate in France.

229
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,708
Not in America?

230
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,337
No, I've never been to America.

231
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,883
When were you in France?

232
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,928
It's been some time now.

233
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,474
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

234
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,976
The truth?

235
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,274
No.

236
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,490
I worry about him so.

237
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,245
- He was fearfully nervous this morning.
- Really?

238
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,332
Father's always nervous
when he sends the gold to Crimea.

239
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,710
He's a different man on those days.

240
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,296
He bears a heavy responsibility.

241
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,840
He acts so strangely!

242
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:34,056
He's entirely opposed to the consumption
of any alcohol before nightfall.

243
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,688
- Very sensible.
- I suspect he breaks his own regulation.

244
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:45,151
For each morning of the shipments
he goes alone to the wine cellars.

245
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:50,072
With no servants to hold the lanterns.
He insists on going alone.

246
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,075
Perhaps he's just checking the contents.

247
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,164
No, he relies upon my stepmother
to stock and care for the cellar.

248
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,127
- Every man has his eccentricities.
- I suppose.

249
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,006
What are your eccentricities,
dear Edward?

250
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,175
Mine? I have none at all.

251
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,928
Well, one.

252
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:17,350
I am excessively preoccupied
with a certain lovely young lady.

253
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,352
Sir!

254
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,104
You're a bold rogue to be so forward.

255
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:28,736
I might even begin to suspect you
of some motive in your advances.

256
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,572
Never, my darling.

257
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,367
Oh, dear Edward.

258
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,577
I'm so happy-

259
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,622
And I am happy too.

260
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,669
He keeps the key
in the bloody wine cellar.

261
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,516
Good evening, madam.
May I be of service?

262
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,104
- Is this the household of Mr Jeffers?
- No, madam. Mr Jeffers' house...

263
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,442
Thank you, my good man.

264
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,002
It's only the wind.

265
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,693
Where do you think it could be?

266
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,575
Shut up!

267
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,244
Sorry.

268
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:42,782
John, would you check the cellar, please?

269
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,950
Yes, madam.

270
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,674
John?

271
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,345
- John? Where's John?
- I'm down here, sir.

272
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:09,433
- What are you doing down there?
- Madam felt she heard a noise...

273
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:12,186
Madam always feels she's heard a noise.

274
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,773
Come along now.
I need you to find my best pipe.

275
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,819
- It's misplaced again.
- Certainly, sir.

276
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,825
That was a close one.
Didn't do my heart any good, I'll say that.

277
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,828
Mind the light.

278
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,996
Here.

279
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,335
That's not the bloody key. See the rust?
Nobody's touched that betty in years.

280
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,589
It's odd, though. I've never seen
the likes of that before, small as it is.

281
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:45,344
Very delicate. it could be a lady's twirl
for some feminine trifle.

282
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,513
Watch the light!

283
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:53,561
It's not my fault you're having trouble.
It's your bloody idea, isn't it?

284
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,606
- Here.
- That's a key for a Chubb safe.

285
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,109
Let's see how fast you can wax.

286
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,112
Mind the light.

287
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,406
Bastard.

288
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,504
Beautiful, isn't it?

289
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,673
Brilliant.

290
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,552
What does this clause mean?

291
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,388
Never mind that.
What about that one over there?

292
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,015
In pink?

293
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:17,144
Wouldn't mind making a deposit
in that one, I dare say.

294
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:20,606
If she didn't provoke a hasty withdrawal.

295
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,275
Not on my account, I fancy.

296
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:29,406
Besides, she is Sir John Basington's minx
and accustomed to hasty withdrawals.

297
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,701
Quite without principle, don't you think?

298
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,915
But here now - I say!

299
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,216
Have you got my deposit account?

300
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:52,346
That's what I call a proper woman.
Which is to say, not proper at all.

301
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,849
She gives good value, long term or short.

302
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,436
You know her?

303
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,357
Where have you been keeping her,
Edward, you rogue?

304
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:09,029
She's a vision.
Not at all bad for a foreign woman.

305
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,492
I don't think she's your type.

306
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,829
She's precisely my type.
Will you make an introduction?

307
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,998
- Fowler.
- Trent.

308
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,085
Will you make an introduction?

309
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,756
Not here, of course.
What are you doing tonight?

310
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,051
Well, I had arranged to go to the theatre...

311
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,596
Come, come, my dear fellow.
Are we not friends?

312
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,185
More than that, Henry.

313
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,730
Much more.

314
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,245
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yes, that's the plan.

315
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,207
That's all you have to say?

316
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,960
It's the job, innit?

317
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:09,673
I suppose you expect me
to dab it up with that fat, repulsive...

318
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:13,052
I suppose you expect me
to go through with it.

319
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,429
It's up to you, innit?

320
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,307
Bloody hell.

321
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,420
Shall we go, darling?

322
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,735
Very nice.

323
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,988
- She's here, is she?
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

324
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,824
Evening, gentlemen.

325
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,661
How can I be of service to you?

326
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,331
My friend would like to see
Madame Lucienne.

327
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,257
She holds a very rigid standard.

328
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,553
- Well, that's all right, isn't it?
- Yes.

329
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,930
Come this way.

330
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:59,366
You go up the stairs, sir...
and through the first door on your right.

331
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,952
Madame Lucienne
will be with you presently.

332
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,121
- Very gay here.
- Yes.

333
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,403
- Monsieur...?
- Jones.

334
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,783
I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

335
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,536
I as well.

336
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,996
You are nervous?

337
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,083
No, I just thought
we might become... better acquainted.

338
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,879
Oh, mon chéri, you are nervous.
There is no need to be.

339
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:58,634
I will take care of every little thing.

340
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,971
And every big thing.

341
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,233
Such a strong man!

342
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:19,404
Well, yes, I did a bit of sport.
When I was younger, of course.

343
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,615
Oh, but you are still young.

344
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,701
And very strong.

345
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:28,247
- You want this off as well?
- It is best, no?

346
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:32,084
The touch of flesh to flesh.

347
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,878
The warmth of the body.

348
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,340
This is the French way, is it?

349
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,053
- What is this?
- A key. But I'm afraid...

350
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:47,182
Oh, there must be nothing between us.

351
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,351
Oh, yes.

352
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,485
Now if you will sit on the lit.

353
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,405
- The what?
- The lit - the bed, the bed.

354
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:10,622
Oh, it is so exciting.

355
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,167
You... How do you say...

356
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,504
You inflame me.

357
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,509
But, madame,
do you not remove your own clothing?

358
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,638
Oh, my own... Why, yes, of course.

359
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,724
In just a moment.

360
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,646
- Just a moment.
- Do make haste, madam.

361
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,815
Yes, yes, I will.

362
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,039
Oh, my God, the police!

363
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,374
Quel mess.

364
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,767
Come on, Henry, for God's sake.

365
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,935
I'm coming.

366
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:18,148
- Police, where are they?
- Downstairs.

367
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,317
- But I could be ruined.
- Quite!

368
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,569
I know the back way.

369
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,587
You couldn't have picked
something more difficult.

370
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,173
- You said you're the bloody best.
- And I am.

371
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:30,220
But that's the devil's own crib.
I've watched it three days. Look there.

372
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:35,267
You have to get past those crushers,
then up those stairs in plain sight.

373
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,936
Then into that crib. Anybody can see you.

374
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,314
Bloody silly.
Invitation to prison, that place is.

375
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,151
What's your pogue up there?

376
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,070
Two Chubb keys in that green cupboard.

377
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,076
What might they be, them keys?

378
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,205
Two keys that I happen to want.

379
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,711
We're partners, aren't we?

380
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,090
If you're trying to say
that you don't trust me completely...

381
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,259
I don't trust you at all.

382
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,179
Good.

383
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:16,641
We've been gulling banksmen,
now we're in a railway station.

384
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,728
What's in a station? Trains is in a...

385
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,773
Mother of God!
You're after the Crimean g...

386
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,152
Trying to rob a moving train -
it can't be done.

387
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,695
Why not?

388
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,364
- It hasn't been done, has it?
- No.

389
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,159
Crimean gold. Mother of God.

390
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:38,872
That's £25,000, isn't it?
A big shipment, isn't it? 25,000 quid.

391
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,082
- Mother of God!
- Are you ready to go in?

392
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,043
Am I... Yes.

393
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,462
Where's the chavy?

394
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,631
There.

395
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,760
He's your son.

396
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,845
I don't have no son.

397
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,056
Louisa says he's your son.

398
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,101
She wouldn't know. Is that him?

399
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,980
He's not my son.
He's too ugly to be my son.

400
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,943
So what's the sweetener?

401
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,111
A guinea.

402
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,573
Well, if he is my son, he'll be worth it.

403
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,500
Are we ready?

404
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:43,061
- Oh, Geoffrey! I've been robbed.
- Stop thief! Stop that boy.

405
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,356
Somebody stop him.

406
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:49,776
Police! Stop that boy.

407
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,658
Stop thief! Stop that boy.

408
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,827
I've got him!

409
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:12,382
- Stop that boy. He's a thief.
- What's going on?

410
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,969
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,514
Take that!

412
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,773
Are you all right?

413
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,114
Under. After him.

414
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,201
Get off!

415
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:44,581
Oh, my dear chap.
Awfully sorry. Are you all right?

416
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,548
Gotcha!

417
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:07,437
Well done. And thank you, gentlemen.

418
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,357
Damn thieves. They're everywhere.

419
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,994
- Did you wax them?
- Not a prayer. Not a bloody prayer.

420
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,163
Never crack that crib.

421
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,750
- Not in daylight.
- I said it was impossible.

422
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,419
What about night?

423
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,800
I've marked this crib
for three nights running.

424
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,804
There's a jack at the top of the stairs
all night long.

425
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:52,148
He talks to the constable making his
rounds - but he doesn't leave his post.

426
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,073
Then at two o'clock
he takes his tightener.

427
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:27,809
And right at 2.30 he goes off
to relieve himself from his bottle of beer.

428
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,978
And that's when I time him.

429
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,317
I time him from when he goes off
to when he comes back.

430
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:53,793
And it's been the same - three nights
running. A very regular bloke, is this jack.

431
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,682
75 seconds.

432
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:10,435
It's a coopered ken.

433
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:16,065
You say you're the fastest screwsman
in the country. Well, here's a challenge.

434
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:21,446
Challenge? 75 seconds for two keys?
It's nigh impossible.

435
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,992
What if a snakesman comes over the roof
and cracks it from the inside?

436
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:30,288
What snakesman's to break that drum?
Nobody good enough is out.

437
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,040
The best is Clean Willy and he's in.

438
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,417
- Where's he in?
- Newgate Prison.

439
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,711
And there's no escaping that.

440
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,177
Only Willy can climb that.

441
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,013
Shame he's in Newgate.

442
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:41,776
No, guv, don't cut me. I'm goin'.

443
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,833
Hello, dearie. Comin' in for a good time?

444
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,335
You won't be sorry.

445
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,239
What's it to be, guv?

446
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,950
Bit of a tickle for you?

447
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,078
You dab it up with Clean Willy
the snakesman, right?

448
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:36,664
I did. He's in Newgate now.

449
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,291
You visit?

450
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,293
I do now and again.

451
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:43,087
I visits as his sister, see?

452
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:47,091
There's another of those
if you can downy him a message.

453
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,385
What's it to be?

454
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:54,265
- Tell Willy to break at the next topping.
- There's no breaks from Newgate.

455
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:58,144
Tell him he breaks at the next topping
or he's not Clean Willy.

456
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:01,940
Tell him to go to the house
where he first met John Simms.

457
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,900
John Simms.

458
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,822
Are you John Simms?

459
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:39,352
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

460
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:51,030
Fine day for a hanging.

461
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,909
Do you really think he'll make it?

462
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,413
- Did you bring the trimmings?
- It's all here.

463
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,498
- Medicine?
- Everything.

464
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,834
- Do you want some cold chicken?
- No.

465
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,629
Willy's the best snakesman there is -
but he can't get out of there.

466
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,591
Dearly beloved,
wonder not if the world hate you.

467
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:15,346
We know that we have passed from death
to life because we love the brethren.

468
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,224
He that loveth not abideth in death.

469
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:21,060
Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer.

470
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:26,107
And you know that no murderer
hath eternal life abiding in himself.

471
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,527
In this we have known the charity of God.

472
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,441
And in God's house...

473
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:19,160
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me,

474
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,330
and in God's house forevermore...

475
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,168
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

476
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,717
They say Willy can climb a wall of glass.

477
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,553
If anyone can do it, Clean Willy can.

478
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:36,612
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

479
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,206
Where is he?

480
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:20,007
Good heavens! He's in a right bad state.

481
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,301
Here, come over here.

482
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,720
Sit down.

483
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,438
Cabinet open...

484
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,816
Cabinet shut.

485
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,485
Door.

486
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,654
Steps.

487
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,033
Done.

488
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,743
Time?

489
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,745
81.

490
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:52,832
Well... better than last time.

491
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,166
Two seconds better.

492
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,836
But you still haven't broken
the 75 seconds.

493
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,255
Well, it is better.

494
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,424
But not good enough.

495
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,011
We'll try again later.

496
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,513
Where are you going?

497
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,141
But you're so tired.

498
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:12,643
I'm not tired.

499
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:25,948
Go.

500
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,367
Steps.

501
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,245
Door.

502
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:34,290
- Cabinet open.
- Fastest bloody screwsman!

503
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,625
Shut up. Time?

504
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:37,460
31.

505
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,628
Cabinet shut.

506
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,714
Door.

507
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,883
Steps.

508
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,428
Time?

509
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,597
74.

510
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,736
I always knew I could do it.

511
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,749
Shit.

512
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,845
Jed?

513
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,597
- Yes.
- All right?

514
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,849
Oh, I'm well enough.

515
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,685
You been at the fight?

516
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:09,273
Fancy Dan and Stunning Bill.
Wasn't my fight, was it?

517
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,442
Put a sovereign on Bill.

518
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,448
Well, he won. I've a quid to show for it.

519
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,671
I'll take another walk round. See you later.

520
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,582
75 seconds, remember?

521
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,845
Now!

522
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,110
13...

523
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,278
14...

524
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:40,280
15...

525
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,790
Where are the bloody keys?

526
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,086
No Chubb keys.

527
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,467
Damn it.

528
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,479
73...

529
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,314
74...

530
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,483
75.

531
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,749
I remember when we first met.

532
01:03:56,667 --> 01:04:00,337
I gave the most awful performance
in Way of The World.

533
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:06,426
I went to my dressing room and there
were the beautiful flowers you'd sent me.

534
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,595
And then you walked in.

535
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,681
Flowers?

536
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,517
Dozens of them. They were wonderful.

537
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,937
I didn't send any.
Must have been someone else.

538
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,273
I walked in and you thanked me.

539
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:22,192
You're teasing me.

540
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:25,070
Bloody waste of good money, flowers.

541
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,241
- You didn't?
- No.

542
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,957
Really?

543
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,297
Really?

544
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,134
I had them at a good price.
I robbed a grave.

545
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,974
All you ever think about is money.

546
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,895
All anyone ever thinks about is money.

547
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,171
Don't turn.

548
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,298
- Mr Simms, is it?
- That's right.

549
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,509
- You came alone?
- Yes, as you instructed.

550
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:33,013
- Everything the same on the railway line?
- All the same.

551
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,514
Then it'll be tomorrow.

552
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,518
- What'll be tomorrow?
- Never you mind. Here's 100 quid for you.

553
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,313
Look the other way and shut your mouth.

554
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:43,982
- Right?
- Right, sir.

555
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:46,652
Now, off you go and don't look back.

556
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:00,707
Get a bowl of water in there.

557
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,711
Put it in the corner, over there.

558
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:07,005
As far away from me as you can.

559
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:10,342
- He's pretty heavy, ain't he?
- Pretty hungry too.

560
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,807
Sorry, sir.
No one's allowed to ride in the van.

561
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,310
I've got to accompany the animal.
It's very valuable.

562
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:26,650
He gets upset if I'm not with him.

563
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,069
Yeah, very well.

564
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,916
Doesn't care for travel.

565
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,384
- You mean it's to be you?
- Aye.

566
01:06:55,762 --> 01:07:00,058
Where'd you make them impressions?
They keep all them keys separate.

567
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,227
- Do they?
- Aye, they do.

568
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,896
How'd you pull 'em?

569
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:08,608
With incredible skill.

570
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:38,638
The next gold shipment is in a week.
This time we take it.

571
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,768
Agar will replace the gold
with these lead bars

572
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,604
and throw the bags
from the train at Romney,

573
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:49,941
where Barlow will collect them
and then drive to Folkestone.

574
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,485
Where will we be?

575
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,489
In a first-class compartment
enjoying the journey.

576
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:58,075
What happens afterward?

577
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,285
We divide the gold as agreed.

578
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,746
After that.

579
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,458
- After that?
- Yes, after that.

580
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,132
You and I will go to Paris.

581
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:29,356
You have it all worked out.
We ride on the train and they do the work.

582
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,984
They have to earn their share, don't they?

583
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,195
It's all very smooth.

584
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,990
Unless something goes wrong.

585
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,368
What could go wrong?

586
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,870
My dear Mr Simms.

587
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:46,331
As your humble servant,

588
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:50,627
I would be greatly obliged and indebted

589
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:56,466
if you could contrive to meet with me
at the Palace, Sydenham

590
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,344
for the purpose...

591
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,014
For the purpose...

592
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,561
For the purpose
of discussing some matters of...

593
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,729
mutual interest.

594
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,898
Most respectfully,

595
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,568
William Williams, Esquire.

596
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,904
That should do it.

597
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,867
Well now, Willy...

598
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:24,828
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?

599
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,080
Please, sir, I can't tell you.

600
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:31,168
Should have thought of that before
we caught you with this purse.

601
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,920
I don't want to go back to prison, sir.

602
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,089
Well, then. Better tell us.

603
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,842
I don't know, sir. I told you.

604
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:43,597
All's I know is that he's a cracksman
planning a flash pull, he is.

605
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,765
The letter will put you on to him.

606
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:53,356
We'll see.

607
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,775
They'll kill me, they Will.

608
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,905
Then see you aren't running off again, eh?

609
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:05,911
We'll have a look
at this mysterious Mr Simms.

610
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,122
Don't turn round, Willy.

611
01:10:56,836 --> 01:11:00,340
- Now, what is it?
- I'm needing a bit, Mr Simms.

612
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,512
- You've been paid.
- I'm needing more.

613
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,684
- You been working, Willy?
- No!

614
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,687
- Did the crushers pick you up?
- I swear it, no!

615
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:22,696
- Willy, if you've turned nose on me...
- I swear it's no flam.

616
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:26,950
A finny or two's what I need
and that'll be an end to it.

617
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,204
There's a finny in your pocket.

618
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:34,708
You're sweating.

619
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:38,545
If you've turned nose on me,
I'll see you in lavender.

620
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,547
Not me, sir. I swear.

621
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,888
Three crushers.

622
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,244
Edward! Edward Pierce.

623
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:16,207
Edward, we were wondering
what had become of you.

624
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,376
I got married.

625
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,171
Must dash.

626
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:29,429
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

627
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:33,767
Very rough man. Not a good sort at all.

628
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:07,063
- So, the snakesman is dead.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

629
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:11,317
- And this fellow Simms has vanished?
- Yes, sir.

630
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:14,153
And we don't know who he is
or what he intends?

631
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:17,407
- We are entirely without clues.
- No, not entirely.

632
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:23,246
We know Simms arranged for Clean Willy
to break from Newgate some months ago.

633
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,916
- So it's a long-standing plan.
- A plan we don't know.

634
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,920
Quite. But we do know Simms is
a safecracker. He must be after safes.

635
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:35,925
And Willy broke into the dispatcher's
office of the South Eastern Railway Line.

636
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:43,600
And it occurred to me, could this Simms
be planning to steal the Crimean gold?

637
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:45,977
Steal from a moving railway train?

638
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,188
Who could imagine such a thing?

639
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:51,608
The next gold shipment is tomorrow.

640
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:55,528
I've alerted the railway line
to take extra precautions.

641
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:58,865
- What's this?
- Precautions, sir.

642
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:03,286
I will ride the train to Folkestone tonight.
I shall be there tomorrow

643
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:06,539
in case there's any tomfoolery
when the gold arrives.

644
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,876
- Very enterprising of you.
- Thank you, sir.

645
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:14,047
We've made new security
arrangements throughout.

646
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:15,673
New lock.

647
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:21,220
New guard, just in case they do have
the audacity to try for the Crimean gold.

648
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,556
Excellent foresight, Mr Sharp.

649
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,143
I must commend you
on your attention in this matter.

650
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:30,563
We certainly wouldn't
want to lose that gold.

651
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:51,000
It's all changed. Everything.
Everything's changed.

652
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:55,380
No one's allowed to ride in the luggage
van save Burgess himself as guard.

653
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:58,216
And they've got a new jack
on the platform

654
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:01,260
who opens all parcels
large enough for a man to hide in.

655
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:06,891
And if that ain't bad enough, they've gone
and fitted a look on the luggage van door.

656
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:13,106
They're locking it at the station and not
opening it until it gets to Folkestone.

657
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:16,859
A precautionary measure.
All on account of the gold.

658
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,947
Bloody outside lock!
It can't be worked from within.

659
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:24,242
Even if I was to be able to
get inside the van

660
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:28,204
I'd be locked inside there
until it gets into Folkestone.

661
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:33,418
And who do you think's behind all this?
Only the crushers theirselves, that's who.

662
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,129
Two plainclothes jacks were there,

663
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:40,633
saying as how a Mr Simms
was planning to rob the Crimean gold.

664
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:45,304
They don't have a high opinion of your
intelligence. But they credit your nerve.

665
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:50,601
And they've put crushers on every station
on the line and at Folkestone.

666
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,937
So. Here we are.

667
01:18:55,648 --> 01:19:00,236
Burgess is no use. I can't get into the van
because of that jack opening everything.

668
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:05,783
Even if I could, I couldn't get the gold out
as the door's locked from the outside.

669
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:08,745
So what's it to have four keys, I ask you?

670
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:12,915
Four keys or 40 keys -
it don't make no bloody difference!

671
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:17,003
It's a waste, the whole thing.
And nothing to be done about it.

672
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:20,965
All on account of they found you out,
Mr Edward bloody Simms Pierce!

673
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:25,636
That was something you didn't think of.
What have you got to say about that?

674
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,436
Find me a dead cat.

675
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:07,887
Now then, missy, now then.

676
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,807
Oh, please, sir, can you help me?

677
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,351
The man is a heartless beast, he is.

678
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,562
- What man?
- That guard upon the line, sir.

679
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:20,483
He will not let me
set my dear brother on the train.

680
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,153
He says it must be...

681
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:26,072
Qpenedu

682
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,325
Why... the cruel rogue.

683
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,828
We'll have your brother on the train.

684
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,249
There's...

685
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,417
no need to open it.

686
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:46,717
I see you have a Bateson's belfry here.

687
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,594
Oh, yes, sir.

688
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:54,934
Me brother, he was terrible afraid of being
buried alive, so here's the safety.

689
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:01,023
Very thoughtful, I'm sure.
Just you dry your eyes. All will be well.

690
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,360
Thank you, sir.

691
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,446
I'll just... get this business finished.

692
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:16,289
- How could you be so cruel?
- I only told her the new rules.

693
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:20,084
- All containers to be opened.
- Yes, I know.

694
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:25,298
Do you smell it? I think in this case
we can make an exception.

695
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:26,966
Whatever you say.

696
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,885
- Nephew.
- Uncle.

697
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,469
Nephew...

698
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:35,308
Mind your duties. Open every parcel
and make no exception.

699
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:37,476
Yes, Uncle.

700
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,981
- What's that ungodly stink?
- The...

701
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:49,280
- Scheduled for the morning train?
- Yes, Uncle.

702
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,744
- See that you open it.
- But Uncle...

703
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,831
No stomach for it, eh?

704
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,001
Dear God, you're a delicate one.

705
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,087
All right, I'll do it myself.

706
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:07,256
For opened it must be.

707
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,765
My dear brother. Richard, he lives!

708
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,934
He lives. Oh, he's alive!

709
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:22,355
Oh, make haste. He's alive.
Oh, praise God, he's alive!

710
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,025
Hurry! Lest we are too late.

711
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:29,278
- I knew it was not cholera.
- Cholera?

712
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:33,532
He was a quack to say it. I knew it! Hurry.

713
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:38,454
- Five clays I've waited to hear that bell.
- You say cholera? Five clays?

714
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,456
Richard!

715
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,713
Oh, no!

716
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:04,563
How can it be? I heard the bell.

717
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,566
Did you not?

718
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,027
I heard it plain.

719
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,405
The bell rang.

720
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:16,158
No, missy.
A gust of wind or a tremor on the ground.

721
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:18,911
I'm sorry.

722
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,080
But I heard it.

723
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,749
Load this on. Sharp now.

724
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,421
Steady.

725
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,343
Careful.

726
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:40,599
Over here. A little to your right.
Set it down.

727
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:45,855
- There's more colour to you now.
- Yes, I feel much better now, thank you.

728
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,857
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, miss.

729
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,278
- All right for you. I'll be in here with it.
- Rather you than me, mate.

730
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,575
Oh, the stench!

731
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,755
- Can you do it?
- I think so.

732
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,840
It's a long way back there.

733
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:59,136
Five carriages, 30 feet each,
that's 150 feet altogether.

734
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:00,846
I'll manage.

735
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,642
- You're not going to get killed, are you?
- Oh, I'd rather not.

736
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,685
Edward!

737
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,856
- Edward Pierce, my dear fellow!
- Damn. Henry Fowler.

738
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,359
He cannot travel in our compartment.

739
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:15,694
Henry! What a surprise.

740
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,697
- Fancy seeing you! Are you on this train?
- Yes.

741
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,991
As a matter of fact, so am I.

742
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:28,165
Oh, forgive me.
Miss Bridget Lawson, Mr Henry Fowler.

743
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:32,711
Miss Lawson is accompanying
her deceased brother,

744
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:37,216
but due to the new regulations
she's not permitted in the guard's van.

745
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:40,302
Therefore she is seeking a compartment.

746
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,973
Well, mine is available.

747
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:48,727
Henry, you're so kind.

748
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,982
You won't join us, will you?

749
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:57,528
As a matter of fact,
I've... made other arrangements.

750
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:01,907
Oh, I see.

751
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:05,578
- You're quite sure?
- Oh, yes.

752
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:08,080
You carry on, Henry.

753
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,045
Miss Lawson.

754
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,340
- You're in capable hands.
- You're too kind.

755
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:20,926
Not at all.

756
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:18,150
Open up.

757
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,319
Open UP, damn you!

758
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:23,822
Are you alive, then?

759
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:26,325
Of course I am, you damnable flat.

760
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:30,162
- Good God, he's alive!
- Open it! Hurry up. I must be quick.

761
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,501
Lift up!

762
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,003
Oh, mother of God.

763
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,965
Oh, the smell!

764
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,343
The things I must do.

765
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:52,017
Do you have... many gentlemen friends?

766
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:58,107
Oh, why sure enough.
Gents are ever so friendly to me, they are.

767
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,443
- Me mum said I was a heartbreaker.
- I'm certain you are.

768
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:07,032
Me mum was a heartbreaker herself.
Had many a caller, she did.

769
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,535
Many a caller.

770
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,871
And always with some little token.

771
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:16,375
Me mum says a man loves you,
he shows you proper.

772
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:19,503
- With some little token.
- Quite so.

773
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:25,009
If you will permit me, I should be
delighted to give you a "token" myself.

774
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:31,307
- You're a bold gent!
- I'm most serious, I assure you.

775
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:34,685
- What, here on the train?
- Why not?

776
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:38,397
Have you not heard of
the 50-mile-an-hour club?

777
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:41,900
I'm told it's beneficial to the circulation.

778
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:59,752
- But the van's locked from outside.
- It's taken care of.

779
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:02,504
- How?
- You'll see soon enough.

780
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:06,675
My friend will come over the top of
the train between Redhill and Ashford.

781
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:09,928
That's the fastest part of the run.

782
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:12,097
I suppose it is.

783
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:16,435
What about all them bridges?
Your friend, mate, he's mad.

784
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,613
- What's going on?
- Take the rope.

785
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:08,036
- Is he up there now?
- He is.

786
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,205
He's lucky to be alive.

787
01:35:10,414 --> 01:35:13,792
- Hold on.
- All right.

788
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,885
Now let it go easy.

789
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:26,471
Go on.

790
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,842
I can't get over the feeling...

791
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:06,845
You look very familiar.

792
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:10,849
- Are you sure we've never met?
- Oh, no, sir.

793
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,520
What does your mum do?

794
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:17,856
Me mum?

795
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,484
She's a seamstress.

796
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,987
An honourable trade.

797
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:29,951
Me mum's made dresses for Lady
Eversham herself, I'll have you know.

798
01:36:32,621 --> 01:36:35,040
I'm acquainted with Lady Eversham.

799
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,997
- All done?
- Done.

800
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:19,376
Good. We've got less than a minute.

801
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,555
Bloody hell, you look a sight.

802
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,849
I look a sight?

803
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:36,518
No, but you're all covered in soot.

804
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:41,606
It's the smoke.

805
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:45,277
- I haven't brought a change of clothing.
- That's brilliant!

806
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,614
What are you going to wear
coming off Folkestone station?

807
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,618
Oh, no!

808
01:37:55,787 --> 01:38:01,626
Bloody hell! You paint me green,
make me lie in a coffin with a dead cat,

809
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,129
and now you strip me bollock-naked. No!

810
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,131
- Shut up.
- Bloody hell!

811
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,966
Let's go.

812
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:30,989
He'll take the river road
and meet us in Folkestone.

813
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:45,629
Take hold of the rope.
We'll be through Ashford soon. Pull it.

814
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,801
We'll pass Ashford soon.

815
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,437
Best lock me up.

816
01:41:08,146 --> 01:41:11,983
- Sweet dreams.
- Not bloody likely.

817
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:34,964
Me mum told me the best gents were the
ones to watch. Full of tricks, they are.

818
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:42,430
I knew of one caller, wanted me to come
to a room he had, full of whips and such.

819
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:44,849
Whips?

820
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:47,018
Can you imagine!

821
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:53,149
- Well, me mum, she told me...
- My dear, my dear, my dearest!

822
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,445
What a man you are!

823
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:01,032
What do you take me for?

824
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,431
Impossible woman.

825
01:43:27,202 --> 01:43:30,371
Robbery indeed. The very idea!

826
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,956
Arrest that man!

827
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:28,990
The court thanks you for providing us
with so clear an explanation

828
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:31,326
of your manner in committing the crime.

829
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:35,413
I'm glad to be of help.
The police seemed to be confused.

830
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:39,250
Do spare us your impoverished
witticisms, Mr Pierce.

831
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:42,587
Your presence here
attests to their efficiency.

832
01:45:42,712 --> 01:45:45,590
You know, you are a very unusual man.

833
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:48,259
Mr Pierce, I put it to you directly.

834
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:52,847
Did you never feel at any time
some sense of impropriety,

835
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:55,516
some recognition of misconduct,

836
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:01,022
some comprehension of unlawful
behaviour, some moral misgivings

837
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,777
in the performance of these
various and sundry criminal acts?

838
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:09,781
- I don't understand the question.
- Evidently not.

839
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:14,285
Sir, it is a recognised truth
of jurisprudence

840
01:46:14,369 --> 01:46:16,746
that laws are created by men

841
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:21,084
and that civilised men,
in a tradition of more than two millennia,

842
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:25,963
agree to abide by these laws
for the common good of all society.

843
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,383
For it is only by the rule of law

844
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:34,931
that any civilisation holds itself above
the promiscuous squalor of barbarism.

845
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:38,726
Now, on the matter of motive, we ask you:

846
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:46,484
why did you conceive, plan and execute
this dastardly and scandalous crime?

847
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:54,242
I wanted the money.

848
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:07,004
He'll get 20 years for that.

849
01:47:55,011 --> 01:47:57,305
What the hell are you waiting for?

850
01:50:36,672 --> 01:50:39,008
