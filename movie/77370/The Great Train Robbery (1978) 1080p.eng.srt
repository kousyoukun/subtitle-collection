1
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,617
<i>In the year 1855,</i>

2
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:30,955
<i>England and France were at
war with Russia in the Crimea.</i>

3
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:34,039
<i>The English troops
were paid in gold.</i>

4
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:38,262
<i>Once a month ?5,000 in gold
was loaded into strongboxes...</i>

5
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:40,736
<i>inside the London bank of
Huddleston and Bradford...</i>

6
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,590
<i>and taken by trusted armed
guards to the railway station.</i>

7
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,472
<i>The convoy followed no
fixed route or timetable.</i>

8
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:50,305
<i>At the station the gold was loaded into
the luggage van of the Folkestone train...</i>

9
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,888
<i>for shipment to the coast
and from there to the Crimea.</i>

10
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:55,769
<i>The strongboxes were placed in
two specially built Chubb safes...</i>

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,352
<i>constructed of three-quarter-
inch tempered steel.</i>

12
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:00,826
<i>Each safe weighed 550 pounds.</i>

13
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:03,952
<i>Each safe was fitted with two
locks requiring two keys,...</i>

14
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:06,045
<i>or four keys altogether.</i>

15
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,986
<i>For security, each key was
individually protected.</i>

16
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,765
<i>Two keys were entrusted to the railway
dispatcher, who kept them in his office.</i>

17
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:16,130
<i>A third was in the custody
of Mr Edgar Trent,...</i>

18
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:18,278
<i>president of the
Huddleston and Bradford.</i>

19
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,507
<i>And the fourth key was
given to Mr Henry Fowler,...</i>

20
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,600
<i>manager of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank.</i>

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,748
<i>The presence of so much
gold in one place...</i>

22
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,357
<i>naturally aroused the interests of
the English criminal elements,...</i>

23
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:32,060
<i>but in 1855 there had never been a
robbery from a moving railway train.</i>

24
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,136
Is he dead?

25
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,822
Mm.

26
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,977
Robbery? I'd hardly call it that...
one poor fellow working alone.

27
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,445
He had no chance of success.

28
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:22,511
Indeed, speaking on
behalf of the bank,...

29
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:26,534
I must inform you the matter was trivial
and hardly worthy of our consideration.

30
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,437
I think I may say that without
fear of contradiction.

31
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:29,661
The villain expired?

32
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,971
Quite. The guard threw him
from the train at full speed.

33
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:33,466
He died instantly. Poor devil.

34
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,886
- He's not been identified?
- I shouldn't think so.

35
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:39,012
The manner of his passing was such
that his features were... disarrayed.

36
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:40,834
He was obviously after
the Crimean gold.

37
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,845
- Apparently. Speaking...
- This damnable war...

38
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,965
- will be the undoing of the nation.
- He's off again.

39
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,412
Unrest in the north, and now this
ill-considered war with the Tsar.

40
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:49,804
What do you expect when one
man in seven has the vote?

41
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,734
We have shopkeepers voting now!

42
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,018
And women next. If
they get their way.

43
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:56,219
Women voting! Really!

44
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,938
- This robbery had interesting...
- They haven't the capacity for logic.

45
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,038
- Too emotional. Quite absurd.
- It's not their logical capacity I enjoy!

46
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:05,381
- Even a good woman's too much trouble.
- Come, Arthur, they do have their uses.

47
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:07,637
Edward's got the proper
view by not marrying at all.

48
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,697
Someone will catch him.

49
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,090
- I know one or two with their eye on him.
- No one will catch Edward.

50
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,700
God knows what a man may catch
in London if he's not married!

51
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,635
This thief on the train, Henry. Was
there a risk of him stealing the gold?

52
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,490
- None. Quite impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

53
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,056
Utterly impossible. Two Chubb safes,
four keys separately guarded. Impossible.

54
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,585
- Still, I suppose it could be done.
- I can't imagine how.

55
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,548
A thief would have to get all four keys.
Two are locked away in the station.

56
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,919
One is in the hands of our president,
Mr Edgar Trent, who is utterly reliable.

57
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,528
I don't know where Mr Trent keeps
his key but I know of the fourth,...

58
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,274
for I am myself entrusted
with guarding it.

59
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:41,074
Damn it, Henry, when are you going to
tell us where you've hidden your key?

60
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:43,766
I keep it about my neck.
I wear it at all times.

61
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,907
Even when bathing?

62
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:47,191
Even while bathing. It
never leaves my person.

63
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:48,876
- Clever.
- Most ingenious.

64
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,676
So you see, to get all four
keys... quite impossible.

65
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:55,074
The Crimean gold and all the bank's
other transactions are entirely safe.

66
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,461
Thank God for that.

67
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,690
You may count on it,
Edward. Count on it.

68
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:02,903
- Who do those men think you are?
- Edward Pierce. A sharp businessman.

69
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,676
A sharp businessman?
That covers a multitude of sins.

70
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:07,362
It does among that group.

71
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,646
And what's your business?

72
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:13,370
It's not really clear. I've made a great
deal of money in coal, in the north.

73
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,006
- Have you?
- Oh, yes, I have. I'm quite well-off.

74
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:16,876
Are you?

75
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:20,383
I think so. I've... made
something of myself.

76
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,069
Do they believe all that?

77
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:26,391
Among sharp businessmen one
doesn't ask too many questions.

78
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,973
Do they know of your
interest in the theatre?

79
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:30,740
An unmarried gentleman
must amuse himself.

80
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,649
- Must he?
- Oh, yes, he must.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,205
Did they mention the train?

82
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,862
Mm-hm.

83
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:39,793
What did they say?

84
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,022
They all agreed that
it was impossible.

85
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,006
Simply impossible.

86
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,692
You like that?

87
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,946
- I can tell it excites you.
- Mm-hm.

88
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,286
Oh! Are you all right?

89
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:12,981
Nice pull.

90
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,820
Not bad, if I do say so
myself. You look well.

91
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,207
Yes. How was the touch?

92
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,566
You saw it, didn't you?

93
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,578
Or was I so fast you
couldn't see it?

94
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:25,051
I saw.

95
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:27,144
- Did you wire her?
- No, just my hands.

96
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,939
Hummingbirds.

97
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,022
- Thinking of a job, then?
- I may have one or two little things.

98
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:38,834
Those one or two little things...
Could they be crib jobs?

99
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,676
They could.

100
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,633
- Bit dicey, are they?
- Very dicey.

101
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,402
- Is it dipping or keys?
- Keys.

102
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,657
- Wax or a straightaway haul?
- Wax.

103
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,968
You didn't do the Berkeley
Hills job, did you?

104
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,681
Berkeley Hills? Shit job.

105
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:52,589
A shit job? Well, they're clean
with 2,000 guineas gone.

106
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,818
No. I was thinking
of something bigger.

107
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,950
- This wax. On the fly?
- Mm-hm.

108
00:07:58,951 --> 00:07:59,956
Then I'm your man.

109
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:02,375
- The fastest screwsman you'll ever see.
- So I heard.

110
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:05,203
- What's it to be, then?
- First we must case a square-rigged gent.

111
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:07,377
Good night.

112
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:08,846
Mr Edgar Trent,...

113
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:11,238
president of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank,...

114
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,977
follows an inflexible routine,...

115
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:16,159
departing the bank at the end
of each day promptly at 7 pm.

116
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:29,913
Mr Trent resides at number
seven Belgrave Square.

117
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:33,148
It's a mansion of 23 rooms,
not including servants' quarters.

118
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,867
His second wife, Emily,
is 30 years his junior...

119
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:40,488
and with her unmarried stepdaughter
she runs the household very strictly.

120
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,375
There are ten servants employed.

121
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,991
Coachman, butler, gardener,
doorman, cook and two maids.

122
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:50,275
All the servants are content
and can't be bribed.

123
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,428
- Dogs?
- Two. Terriers. Walks 'em twice a day.

124
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,603
Seven in the morning
and 8.15 at night.

125
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,343
- Children?
- Five.

126
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,088
Three at home. The youngest
is a boy who sleepwalks.

127
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:01,856
Which creates a commotion.

128
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:12,457
No point in cracking a 23-room house
until we find out where the key is.

129
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:15,149
The person who knows where
that key is is Mr Trent.

130
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,677
Really?

131
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,625
He must have a weakness.
Gambling, drink... Women?

132
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:24,609
Well, hello!

133
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,155
No, no, no.

134
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,438
No!

135
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,793
No respectable gentleman
is that respectable.

136
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,553
- He's a ratting gent.
- Indeed he is.

137
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,741
Thank you, gentlemen, please!
Mind your back there, sir!

138
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,209
Thank you! Excuse me, sir!

139
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,465
Nothing but the finest, gentlemen.

140
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,053
Every one country-born and bred,
not a water ditch among 'em.

141
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:20,935
Who wants to try a rat? Come on,
gents. Who wants to try a rat?

142
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:22,974
15 of your best for my fancy.

143
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:26,508
Weigh the fancy of Mr T.
A very sporting gentleman.

144
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:29,770
Let Mr T's fancy dog
through. There you are.

145
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:33,685
- 14 pounds.
- 14 pounds is Mr T's fancy dog.

146
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,832
And he's called for
a try at 15 rats.

147
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:38,116
- Shall it be three minutes, Mr T?
- Yes.

148
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,487
Three minutes it is. You
may wager as you feel fit.

149
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,960
Get him his 15, Tom.

150
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,549
You win some, you lose some.

151
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,878
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

152
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,003
And... go!

153
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,567
Time, gentlemen. Three minutes!

154
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,584
Get the dog out. Get the dog out.
Thank you, gentlemen.

155
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:35,943
Pay your debts. Who's next?

156
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:38,091
Come on! Any man fancy his fancy?

157
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:40,646
A sporting chap. You win one
or two, you lose one or two.

158
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,941
Who's going to be next to try the finest
country-bred rats that money can buy?

159
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,569
May I join you?

160
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,444
If you like.

161
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,992
Lover wasn't at his best. He lacked
bustle. But he came up well enough.

162
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:05,221
- My Lover will fight again.
- Indeed.

163
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,260
And I shall wager upon
him again when he does.

164
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,679
- Did you lose much?
- Ten guineas. A trifle.

165
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,555
Ten guineas!

166
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,110
Well, I'm pleased you
take it so lightly.

167
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:16,965
I admire a man who may
keep a fancy and sport him.

168
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:20,037
I should do so myself were I not
so often abroad on business.

169
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,864
Whenever I'm gone, my wife
looks after the animals.

170
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,398
I fear I've been too devoted to
business these past few years.

171
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,627
I've never married.

172
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,862
- Of course, I should like to.
- Of course.

173
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:35,477
It's so hard to
meet a suitable girl.

174
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,889
- What are you constructing?
- A water wheel. Delightful.

175
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,640
Especially with the rusted curve of the
water wheel itself. Don't you agree?

176
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:52,304
We are building the rusted
wheel at considerable expense.

177
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:56,083
It is constructed of previously rusted
metal. The craftsmen are ingenious.

178
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:59,862
But we must wait for the weeds to grow
before it takes on the proper appearance.

179
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,683
Oh, I'm sure it'll
be a handsome ruin.

180
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:02,988
Where is Elizabeth?

181
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:04,918
I have passed many
pleasant hours here...

182
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,208
watching the workmen fit each
piece into its precise slot.

183
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,165
Such skill.

184
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:11,687
They screw it together?

185
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:14,813
No, bolt it, actually, with
long bolts. Fitted tightly.

186
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:17,804
Yes. Long bolts, fitted tightly.

187
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:22,071
I've just returned from America,
a country of many prominent erections.

188
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:24,192
It is exciting to see
things come together.

189
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,421
So long as the quality
does not suffer.

190
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,813
Tight-fitting joints.
That's the secret.

191
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:31,504
It is so rare these days.

192
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,767
It depends on the skill of
the workman, of course.

193
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,805
And he must have the proper tools.

194
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,627
Ah, my darling daughter!

195
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:42,188
Now may I present Mr Edward
Pierce? My daughter Elizabeth.

196
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,879
Miss Trent, you've taken
me completely by surprise.

197
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,619
I cannot tell if that's
to my advantage.

198
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,332
I can assure you it is, wholly.

199
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:51,377
- Would you try one of these, Mr Pierce?
- With gratitude.

200
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:52,382
Er...

201
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,557
We are just discussing
the ruins, Elizabeth.

202
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,792
- It's coming along so nicely.
- That dreadful ruin. I can't bear it.

203
00:13:58,336 --> 00:13:59,966
They've taken away so many flowers.

204
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,000
You're fond of flowers?

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,305
- More tea, Mr Pierce?
- Ah, yes.

206
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:05,132
Yes, I supervise the planting of
all the flowers in the garden.

207
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:06,382
What there is left of it.

208
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:08,230
I'm especially fond
of the primroses.

209
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,155
Ah, yes!

210
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,976
Perhaps you'd like to see them?

211
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,253
I'd be delighted!

212
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:13,940
Will you excuse us?

213
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:16,331
It's quite rare for a man to
take an interest in flowers.

214
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,779
The best of them are just
over here. Let me show you.

215
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:20,735
I don't know that he's
suitable for her.

216
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,263
- Oh, he seems nice enough.
- He has far too much to say.

217
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:26,036
We also have many daffodils.
They've just come up.

218
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:29,570
It gives me such pleasure to see beautiful
things spring forth. Don't you agree?

219
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,311
Yes, I do agree. But tell me...

220
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:38,134
He has his charm.

221
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,336
You don't care who
she marries, do you?

222
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,055
Is she really plain?

223
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,875
That she is.

224
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,839
- And you find her tedious?
- Unbearably tedious.

225
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,992
- How does she wear her hair?
- On her head.

226
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,086
Really, I never noticed.

227
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,695
You're in a hurry.

228
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,163
I am a relentless suitor.

229
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,746
Besides, she still hasn't
told me what I need to know.

230
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:02,083
Where did you learn to ride?

231
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,801
- A lady never asks such a question.
- I'm serious.

232
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,107
France.

233
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,602
On an estate in France.

234
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:09,179
Not in America?

235
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,653
No, I've never been to America.

236
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,615
When were you in France?

237
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,600
It's been some time now.

238
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,509
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

239
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,194
The truth?

240
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,125
The truth?

241
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:25,299
No.

242
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:57,377
I worry about him so.

243
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:00,204
- He was fearfully nervous this morning.
- Really?

244
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,868
Father's always nervous when
he sends the gold to Crimea.

245
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,417
He's a different man on those days.

246
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:06,239
He bears a heavy responsibility.

247
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,033
He acts so strangely!

248
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:13,116
He's entirely opposed to the consumption
of any alcohol before nightfall.

249
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:17,439
- Very sensible.
- I suspect he breaks his own regulation.

250
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,347
For each morning of the shipments
he goes alone to the wine cellars.

251
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:23,800
With no servants to hold the
lanterns. He insists on going alone.

252
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:25,513
Perhaps he's just
checking the contents.

253
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:29,101
No, he relies upon my stepmother
to stock and care for the cellar.

254
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,336
- Every man has his eccentricities.
- I suppose.

255
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:34,592
What are your eccentricities,
dear Edward?

256
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,278
Mine? I have none at all.

257
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:38,072
Well, one.

258
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,334
I am excessively preoccupied
with a certain lovely young lady.

259
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,639
Sir!

260
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,705
You're a bold rogue
to be so forward.

261
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:49,027
I might even begin to suspect you
of some motive in your advances.

262
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:50,876
Never, my darling.

263
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:52,452
Oh, dear Edward.

264
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,138
I'm so happy.

265
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:56,123
And I am happy too.

266
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:59,412
He keeps the key in
the bloody wine cellar.

267
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,540
Good evening, madam.
May I be of service?

268
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,802
- Is this the household of Mr Jeffers?
- No, madam. Mr Jeffers' house...

269
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,005
Thank you, my good man.

270
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,477
- Shh!
- It's only the wind.

271
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,917
Where do you think it could be?

272
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:07,913
Shut up!

273
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,142
Sorry.

274
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,476
Shh!

275
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,336
John, would you check
the cellar, please?

276
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:36,022
Yes, madam.

277
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:45,998
John?

278
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,472
- John? Where's John?
- I'm down here, sir.

279
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:51,707
- What are you doing down there?
- Madam felt she heard a noise...

280
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,583
Madam always feels
she's heard a noise.

281
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,921
Come along now. I need
you to find my best pipe.

282
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:58,748
- It's misplaced again.
- Certainly, sir.

283
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,814
That was a close one.

284
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:02,934
Didn't do my heart any
good, I'll say that.

285
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,565
Mind the light!

286
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:05,762
Here.

287
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:09,241
That's not the bloody key. See the rust?
Nobody's touched that betty in years.

288
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,014
It's odd, though. I've never seen the
likes of that before, small as it is.

289
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:15,113
Very delicate. It could be a lady's
twirl for some feminine trifle.

290
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,798
Watch the light!

291
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,741
It's not my fault you're having
trouble. It's your bloody idea, isn't it?

292
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:23,132
- Here.
- That's a key for a Chubb safe.

293
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,008
Let's see how fast you can wax.

294
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,775
Mind the light.

295
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,461
Bastard.

296
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:38,029
Beautiful, isn't it?

297
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,715
Brilliant.

298
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:09,346
What does this clause mean?

299
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:11,276
Never mind that. What about
that one over there?

300
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:12,391
In pink?

301
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:14,946
Wouldn't mind making a deposit
in that one, I dare say.

302
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:17,338
If she didn't provoke
a hasty withdrawal.

303
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,942
Not on my account, I fancy.

304
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:22,938
Besides, she is Sir John Basington's
minx and accustomed to hasty withdrawals!

305
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,358
Quite without principle,
don't you think?

306
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,756
But here now... I say!

307
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,133
Monsieur, avez... Excuse-moi.

308
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,654
Have you got my deposit account?

309
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:38,162
That's what I call a proper woman.
Which is to say, not proper at all!

310
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,445
She gives good value,
long term or short.

311
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:41,315
Eh?

312
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,511
- You know her?
- Mm.

313
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:45,338
Where have you been keeping
her, Edward, you rogue?

314
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:49,035
She's a vision. Not at all
bad for a foreign woman.

315
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:51,672
I don't think she's your type.

316
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:53,847
She's precisely my type.
Will you make an introduction?

317
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,532
- Fowler.
- Trent.

318
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,197
Will you make an introduction?

319
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:00,969
Not here, of course.
What are you doing tonight?

320
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,118
Well, I had arranged to
go to the theatre...

321
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:05,700
Come, come, my dear fellow.
Are we not friends?

322
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,315
More than that, Henry.

323
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,000
Much more.

324
00:22:18,776 --> 00:22:21,114
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yes, that's the plan.

325
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,696
That's all you have to say?

326
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:25,354
It's the job, innit?

327
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:28,289
I suppose you expect me to dab
it up with that fat, repulsive...

328
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,628
I suppose you expect me
to go through with it!

329
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:32,313
It's up to you, innit?

330
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,189
Bloody hell!

331
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:53,816
Shall we go, darling?

332
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,741
Very nice.

333
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:10,861
- She's here, is she?
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

334
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,057
Evening, gentlemen.

335
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,558
How can I be of service to you?

336
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,222
My friend would like to
see Madame Lucienne.

337
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:19,777
Madame Lucienne?

338
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,164
Madame Lucienne.

339
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,040
She holds a very rigid standard.

340
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:25,703
- Well, that's all right, isn't it?
- Yes.

341
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,389
Come this way.

342
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:39,785
You go up the stairs, sir... and
through the first door on your right.

343
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,470
Madame Lucienne will
be with you presently.

344
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:43,156
- Very gay here.
- Yes.

345
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:04,170
- Monsieur...?
- Er... Jones.

346
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,230
Jones.

347
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,704
I am very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

348
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,226
I as well.

349
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:10,177
You are nervous?

350
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:12,842
No, I just thought we might
become... better acquainted.

351
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,316
Oh, mon ch閞i, you are nervous.
There is no need to be.

352
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:18,687
I will take care of
every little thing.

353
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,513
And every big thing.

354
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,461
Oh...

355
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:28,854
Such a strong man!

356
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,952
Well, yes, I did a bit of sport.
When I was younger, of course.

357
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:33,665
Oh, but you are still young.

358
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,405
And very strong.

359
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,851
- You want this off as well?
- It is best, no?

360
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,489
The touch of flesh to flesh.

361
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,310
The warmth of the body.

362
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:44,974
- This is the French way, is it?
- Oui, mon cher.

363
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:47,366
- What is this?
- A key. But I'm afraid...

364
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:50,057
Oh, there must be nothing...
nothing between us.

365
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:51,743
Oh, yes.

366
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:57,424
Now if you will sit on the lit.

367
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:00,197
- The what?
- The lit... the bed, the bed, the bed.

368
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:05,607
Oh, it is so exciting!

369
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,918
You... How do you say...

370
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,093
You inflame me.

371
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,355
But, madame, do you not
remove your own clothing?

372
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,773
Oh, my own... Why, yes, of course.

373
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,405
In just a moment.

374
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,993
- Just a moment.
- Do make haste, madam.

375
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:22,679
Yes, yes, I will.

376
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,574
Oh, my God, the police!

377
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,124
Quel mess!

378
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:45,187
Come on, Henry, for God's sake!

379
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:46,873
I'm coming!

380
00:25:47,553 --> 00:25:49,346
- Police, where are they?
- Downstairs.

381
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,815
- But I could be ruined!
- Quite!

382
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,500
I know the back way.

383
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:31,346
You couldn't have picked
something more difficult.

384
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:33,032
- You said you're the bloody best.
- And I am.

385
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:36,594
But that's the devil's own crib. I've
watched it three days. Look there.

386
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,611
You have to get past those crushers,
then up those stairs in plain sight.

387
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:41,351
Then into that crib.
Anybody can see you.

388
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,825
Bloody silly. Invitation
to prison, that place is.

389
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,401
What's your pogue up there?

390
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,576
Two Chubb keys in
that green cupboard.

391
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:51,491
What might they be, them keys?

392
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,182
Two keys that I happen to want.

393
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:57,743
We're partners, aren't we?

394
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:00,352
If you're trying to say that you
don't trust me completely...

395
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,038
I don't trust you at all.

396
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:03,669
Good.

397
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,741
We've been gulling banksmen,
now we're in a railway station.

398
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:08,862
What's in a station?
Trains is in a...

399
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,226
Mother of God! You're
after the Crimean g...

400
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:13,428
Trying to rob a moving
train... it can't be done.

401
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:14,434
Why not?

402
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,174
- It hasn't been done, has it?
- No.

403
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:17,995
Crimean gold. Mother of God!

404
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:21,067
That's ?5,000, isn't it? A big
shipment, isn't it? 25,000 quid.

405
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,562
- Mother of God!
- Are you ready to go in?

406
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:23,785
Am I... Yes.

407
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:25,362
Where's the chavy?

408
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:27,048
There.

409
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:29,495
He's your son.

410
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:30,826
I don't have no son.

411
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,104
Louisa says he's your son.

412
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,409
Hmph! Louisa!

413
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,958
She wouldn't know. Is that him?

414
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,704
He's not my son. He's
too ugly to be my son!

415
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,015
So what's the sweetener?

416
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:41,701
A guinea.

417
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:43,957
Well, if he is my son,
he'll be worth it.

418
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,916
- Are we ready?
- Mm!

419
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:03,176
- Oh, Geoffrey! I've been robbed!
- Stop thief! Stop that boy!

420
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:05,323
Somebody stop him!

421
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,552
Police! Stop that boy!

422
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,565
Police! Stop that boy!

423
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,766
Stop thief! Stop that boy!

424
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,452
I've got him!

425
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,287
- Stop that boy. He's a thief.
- What's going on?

426
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

427
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,935
Take that!

428
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:32,970
Are you all right?

429
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,755
Under! After him.

430
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:40,419
Get off!

431
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:43,273
Oh, my dear chap. Awfully
sorry. Are you all right?

432
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,711
Gotcha!

433
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,898
Well done. And thank
you, gentlemen.

434
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,073
Damn thieves. They're everywhere.

435
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:08,038
- Did you wax them?
- Not a prayer. Not a bloody prayer.

436
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,588
Never crack that crib.

437
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:11,926
- Not in daylight.
- I said it was impossible.

438
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:13,802
- What about night?
- Night!

439
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:17,037
I've marked this crib
for three nights.

440
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:19,918
There's a jack at the top
of the stairs all night long.

441
00:29:23,452 --> 00:29:27,313
He talks to the constable making his
rounds... but he doesn't leave his post.

442
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:32,477
Then at two o'clock he
takes his tightener.

443
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:50,283
And right at 2.30 he goes off to
relieve himself from his bottle of beer.

444
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:51,969
And that's when I time him.

445
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:56,101
I time him from when he goes
off to when he comes back.

446
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,491
And it's been the same... three nights
running. A very regular bloke, is this jack.

447
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:16,543
75 seconds.

448
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:18,066
It's a coopered ken.

449
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,736
You say you're the fastest screwsman
in the country. Well, here's a challenge.

450
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,515
Challenge? 75 seconds for two keys?
It's nigh impossible.

451
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:28,205
What if a snakesman comes over the
roof and cracks it from the inside?

452
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:31,006
What snakesman's to break that drum?
Nobody good enough is out.

453
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:32,147
The best is Clean
Willy and he's in.

454
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:33,697
- Where's he in?
- Newgate Prison.

455
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,464
And there's no escaping that.

456
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:40,329
Only Willy can climb that.

457
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,178
Shame he's in Newgate.

458
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:17,872
No, guv, don't cut me. I'm goin'.

459
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:27,631
Hello, dearie. Comin'
in for a good time?

460
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:29,316
You won't be sorry.

461
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,155
What's it to be, guv?

462
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:49,650
Bit of a tickle for you?

463
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:51,689
You dab it up with Clean
Willy the snakesman, right?

464
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,374
I did. He's in Newgate now.

465
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,435
You visit?

466
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:55,739
I do now and again.

467
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,832
I visits as his sister, see?

468
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,170
There's another of those if
you can downy him a message.

469
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:01,665
What's it to be?

470
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,928
- Tell Willy to break at the next topping.
- There's no breaks from Newgate!

471
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,374
Tell him he breaks at the next
topping or he's not Clean Willy.

472
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,848
Tell him to go to the house
where he first met John Simms.

473
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:11,398
John Simms.

474
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:15,258
Are you John Simms?

475
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:34,423
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

476
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:37,169
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

477
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:39,887
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

478
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,117
Fine day for a hanging.

479
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,645
Do you really think he'll make it?

480
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:46,656
- Did you bring the trimmings?
- It's all here.

481
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,015
- Medicine?
- Everything.

482
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,537
- Do you want some cold chicken?
- No.

483
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:52,283
Willy's the best snakesman there is...
but he can't get out of there.

484
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:54,594
Dearly beloved, wonder
not if the world hate you.

485
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:57,693
We know that we have passed from death
to life because we love the brethren.

486
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,569
He that loveth not
abideth in death.

487
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:01,417
Whosoever hateth his
brother is a murderer.

488
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:04,706
And you know that no murderer hath
eternal life abiding in himself.

489
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:07,208
In this we have known
the charity of God.

490
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,570
And in God's house...

491
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:39,502
Goodness and mercy all my
life shall surely follow me...

492
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:41,623
and in God's house forevermore...

493
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:44,776
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

494
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,425
They say Willy can
climb a wall of glass.

495
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:51,546
If anyone can do it,
Clean Willy can.

496
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:30,039
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

497
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:36,944
Where is he?

498
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,321
Good heavens! He's
in a right bad state.

499
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:38,653
Here, come over here.

500
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,501
Sit down.

501
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:46,564
Cabinet open...

502
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:48,385
- Cabinet shut.
- Cabinet shut.

503
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,852
Door.

504
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:51,538
Steps.

505
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:54,120
Done!

506
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,234
Time?

507
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:56,539
81.

508
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,552
Well... better than last time.

509
00:35:58,553 --> 00:35:59,421
Two seconds better.

510
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,161
But you still haven't
broken the 75 seconds.

511
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:02,738
Well, it is better.

512
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:04,424
But not good enough.

513
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:06,707
We'll try again later.

514
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,393
Where are you going?

515
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,051
But you're so tired.

516
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,737
I'm not tired.

517
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:20,299
Go!

518
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:21,985
Steps.

519
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:23,589
Door.

520
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,573
- Cabinet open.
- Fastest bloody screwsman!

521
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,095
Shut up. Time?

522
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:27,639
31.

523
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,107
Cabinet shut.

524
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:30,412
Door.

525
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,097
Steps.

526
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,136
Time?

527
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,822
74.

528
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:38,785
74?

529
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,253
74.

530
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:45,037
I always knew I could do it.

531
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:00,497
Psst!

532
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:02,184
Psst!

533
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:09,414
Shit!

534
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,325
Jed? Jed?

535
00:39:17,326 --> 00:39:18,575
- Yes.
- All right?

536
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:19,907
Oh, I'm well enough.

537
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,266
You been at the fight?

538
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:24,746
Hmph! Fancy Dan and Stunning
Bill. Wasn't my fight, was it?

539
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:26,432
Put a sovereign on Bill.

540
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,346
Well, he won! I've a
quid to show for it.

541
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:40,269
I'll take another walk round.
See you later.

542
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:03,702
75 seconds, remember?

543
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:12,319
Now!

544
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,344
13...

545
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:22,785
14...

546
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:24,090
15...

547
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,503
16...

548
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:26,863
17...

549
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:28,086
18...

550
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:28,493
19...

551
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,288
- Where are the bloody keys?
- 20.

552
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:31,783
21...

553
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:33,061
No Chubb keys.

554
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:34,338
23...

555
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:35,670
24...

556
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:36,894
- 25...
- Damn it!

557
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,226
26...

558
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,340
27...

559
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:40,400
28...

560
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:41,678
29...

561
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,629
30.

562
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,989
31...

563
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,403
32...

564
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:46,626
33...

565
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:48,040
34...

566
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,480
35...

567
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,867
36...

568
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:52,280
37...

569
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,640
38...

570
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:55,053
39...

571
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:56,521
40.

572
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:57,799
41...

573
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,158
42...

574
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:00,626
43...

575
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,012
44...

576
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:03,399
45...

577
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:04,813
46...

578
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,226
47...

579
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:07,503
48...

580
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:08,781
49...

581
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,005
50.

582
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:11,418
51...

583
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:12,724
52...

584
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,055
53...

585
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,305
54...

586
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,665
55...

587
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:18,024
56...

588
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,139
57...

589
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:20,553
58...

590
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:21,830
59...

591
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:23,271
60!

592
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,576
61...

593
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:25,908
62...

594
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:27,104
63...

595
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,300
64...

596
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:29,551
65...

597
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:30,964
66...

598
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:32,241
67...

599
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:33,464
68...

600
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:34,769
69...

601
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,721
70.

602
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:36,754
71...

603
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:37,978
72...

604
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:39,201
73...

605
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:40,451
74...

606
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,028
75!

607
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:52,658
I remember when we first met.

608
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:55,621
I gave the most awful performance
in Way of The World.

609
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:59,344
I went to my dressing room and there were
the beautiful flowers you'd sent me.

610
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:01,030
And then you walked in.

611
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,090
- Flowers?
- Mm.

612
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,048
Dozens of them.
They were wonderful.

613
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:06,195
I didn't send any. Must
have been someone else.

614
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:07,962
I walked in and you thanked me.

615
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,620
You're teasing me.

616
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:11,741
Bloody waste of good
money, flowers.

617
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:14,459
- You didn't?
- No.

618
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:19,488
Really?

619
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:23,620
Really?

620
00:42:23,784 --> 00:42:26,148
I had them at a good price.
I robbed a grave.

621
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:30,580
All you ever think about is money.

622
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:33,135
All anyone ever thinks
about is money.

623
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:49,989
Don't turn.

624
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:51,375
- Mr Simms, is it?
- That's right.

625
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:53,550
- You came alone?
- Yes, as you instructed.

626
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:55,752
- Everything the same on the railway line?
- All the same.

627
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:56,759
Then it'll be tomorrow.

628
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:59,476
- What'll be tomorrow?
- Never you mind. Here's 100 quid for you.

629
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,162
Look the other way
and shut your mouth.

630
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,902
- Right?
- Right, sir.

631
00:43:02,903 --> 00:43:04,914
Now, off you go and
don't look back.

632
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,075
Get a bowl of water in there.

633
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:16,413
Put it in the corner, over there.

634
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:17,907
As far away from me as you can.

635
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:20,355
- He's pretty heavy, ain't he?
- Pretty hungry too.

636
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,296
Sorry, sir. No one's
allowed to ride in the van.

637
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:26,852
I've got to accompany the
animal. It's very valuable.

638
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:30,874
He gets upset if I'm not with him.

639
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah, very well.

640
00:43:39,928 --> 00:43:41,613
Doesn't care for travel.

641
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:47,757
- You mean it's to be you?
- Aye.

642
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:52,486
Where'd you make them impressions?
They keep all them keys separate.

643
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:54,172
- Do they?
- Aye, they do.

644
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:55,912
How'd you pull 'em?

645
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:58,358
With incredible skill.

646
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,904
The next gold shipment is in
a week. This time we take it.

647
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,323
Agar will replace the gold
with these lead bars...

648
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,172
and throw the bags from
the train at Romney,...

649
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:25,000
where Barlow will collect them
and then drive to Folkestone.

650
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,005
Where will we be?

651
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:28,887
In a first-class compartment
enjoying the journey.

652
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:30,300
What happens afterward?

653
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:31,931
We divide the gold as agreed.

654
00:44:31,932 --> 00:44:33,507
After that.

655
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:36,036
- After that?
- Yes, after that!

656
00:44:39,354 --> 00:44:41,038
You and I will go to Paris.

657
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:50,688
You have it all worked out. We ride
on the train and they do the work.

658
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,081
They have to earn their
share, don't they?

659
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,767
It's all very smooth.

660
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:57,240
Unless something goes wrong.

661
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:58,762
What could go wrong?

662
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,312
My dear Mr Simms.

663
00:45:00,313 --> 00:45:02,025
As your humble servant,...

664
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:04,825
I would be greatly
obliged and indebted...

665
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:08,631
if you could contrive to meet with
me at the Palace, Sydenham...

666
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:10,507
for the purpose...

667
00:45:11,213 --> 00:45:12,899
For the purpose...

668
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,644
For the purpose of discussing
some matters of...

669
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:17,003
mutual interest.

670
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:18,689
Most respectfully,...

671
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:20,456
William Williams, Esquire.

672
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,604
That should do it.

673
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,186
Well now, Willy...

674
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:26,844
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?

675
00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:28,366
Please, sir, I can't tell you.

676
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:31,112
Should have thought of that before
we caught you with this purse.

677
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:32,798
I don't want to go
back to prison, sir.

678
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:34,483
Well, then. Better tell us.

679
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:36,250
I don't know, sir. I told you.

680
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:39,104
All's I know is that he's a cracksman
planning a flash pull, he is.

681
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:40,789
The letter will put you on to him.

682
00:45:44,216 --> 00:45:45,629
We'll see.

683
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:47,314
They'll kill me, they will.

684
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:49,978
Then see you aren't
running off again, eh?

685
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,892
We'll have a look at this
mysterious Mr Simms.

686
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:23,361
Don't turn round, Willy.

687
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:29,396
- Now, what is it?
- I'm needing a bit, Mr Simms.

688
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:32,739
- You've been paid.
- I'm needing more.

689
00:46:33,174 --> 00:46:35,838
- You been working, Willy?
- No!

690
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,068
- Did the crushers pick you up?
- I swear it, no!

691
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:43,694
- Willy, if you've turned nose on me...
- I swear it's no flam.

692
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:46,712
A finny or two's what I need
and that'll be an end to it.

693
00:46:47,664 --> 00:46:49,485
There's a finny in your pocket.

694
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,496
You're sweating.

695
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:53,997
If you've turned nose on
me, I'll see you in lavender.

696
00:46:53,998 --> 00:46:55,574
Not me, sir. I swear!

697
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:01,038
Three crushers.

698
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,582
Edward! Edward Pierce!

699
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:18,545
Edward, we were wondering
what had become of you.

700
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:20,231
I got married.

701
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,052
Must dash.

702
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:27,162
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

703
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:30,262
Very rough man. Not
a good sort at all.

704
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,011
- So, the snakesman is dead.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

705
00:49:49,011 --> 00:49:51,785
- And this fellow Simms has vanished?
- Yes, sir.

706
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:53,633
And we don't know who
he is or what he intends?

707
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:55,753
- We are entirely without clues.
- No, not entirely.

708
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:59,559
We know Simms arranged for Clean Willy
to break from Newgate some months ago.

709
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,951
- So it's a long-standing plan.
- A plan we don't know.

710
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:04,561
Quite. But we do know Simms is a
safecracker. He must be after safes.

711
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:07,823
And Willy broke into the dispatcher's
office of the South Eastern Railway Line.

712
00:50:07,824 --> 00:50:09,399
Hmm.

713
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,825
And it occurred to me, could this Simms
be planning to steal the Crimean gold?

714
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:14,647
Steal from a moving railway train?

715
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:16,494
Who could imagine such a thing?

716
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:18,045
The next gold shipment is tomorrow.

717
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:20,600
I've alerted the railway line
to take extra precautions.

718
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,775
- What's this?
- Precautions, sir.

719
00:50:22,775 --> 00:50:25,656
I will ride the train to Folkestone
tonight. I shall be there tomorrow...

720
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:27,776
in case there's any tomfoolery
when the gold arrives.

721
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:30,250
- Very enterprising of you.
- Thank you, sir.

722
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:32,697
We've made new security
arrangements throughout.

723
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:33,730
New lock.

724
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:37,373
New guard, just in case they do have
the audacity to try for the Crimean gold.

725
00:50:37,373 --> 00:50:38,868
Excellent foresight, Mr Sharp.

726
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,205
I must commend you on your
attention in this matter.

727
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,734
We certainly wouldn't
want to lose that gold.

728
00:50:53,847 --> 00:50:56,756
It's all changed. Everything.
Everything's changed.

729
00:50:56,756 --> 00:50:59,610
No one's allowed to ride in the luggage
van save Burgess himself as guard.

730
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,458
And they've got a new
jack on the platform...

731
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,470
who opens all parcels large
enough for a man to hide in.

732
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:07,113
And if that ain't bad enough, they've gone
and fitted a lock on the luggage van door.

733
00:51:07,113 --> 00:51:11,190
They're locking it at the station and not
opening it until it gets to Folkestone.

734
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:13,882
A precautionary measure.
All on account of the gold.

735
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:16,301
Bloody outside lock! It can't
be worked from within.

736
00:51:16,302 --> 00:51:18,421
Even if I was to be able
to get inside the van...

737
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:21,003
I'd be locked inside there
until it gets into Folkestone.

738
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:24,674
And who do you think's behind all this?
Only the crushers theirselves, that's who.

739
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:26,196
Two plainclothes
jacks were there...

740
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:29,132
saying as how a Mr Simms was
planning to rob the Crimean gold.

741
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:32,176
They don't have a high opinion of your
intelligence. But they credit your nerve.

742
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:35,602
And they've put crushers on every
station on the line and at Folkestone.

743
00:51:35,603 --> 00:51:37,397
So. Here we are.

744
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:41,881
Burgess is no use. I can't get into the van
because of that jack opening everything.

745
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:45,497
Even if I could, I couldn't get the gold
out as the door's locked from the outside.

746
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:47,427
So what's it to have
four keys, I ask you?

747
00:51:47,428 --> 00:51:50,146
Four keys or 40 keys... it don't
make no bloody difference!

748
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:52,810
It's a waste, the whole thing!
And nothing to be done about it.

749
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:55,392
All on account of they found you
out, Mr Edward bloody Simms Pierce!

750
00:51:55,393 --> 00:51:58,709
That was something you didn't think of.
What have you got to say about that?

751
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:03,793
Find me a dead cat.

752
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:26,002
Now then, missy, now then.

753
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,878
Oh, please, sir, can you help me?

754
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:29,781
The man is a
heartless beast, he is.

755
00:52:29,782 --> 00:52:31,901
- What man?
- That guard upon the line, sir.

756
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:34,457
He will not let me set my
dear brother on the train.

757
00:52:34,974 --> 00:52:36,767
He says it must be...

758
00:52:36,768 --> 00:52:37,827
opened!

759
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:39,947
Why... the cruel rogue.

760
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,851
We'll have your
brother on the train.

761
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:44,460
There's, um...

762
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,146
no need to open it.

763
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,284
I, um... I see you have
a Bateson's belfry here.

764
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:52,697
Oh, yes, sir.

765
00:52:52,697 --> 00:52:56,911
Me brother, he was terrible afraid of
being buried alive, so here's the safety.

766
00:52:57,564 --> 00:53:00,880
Very thoughtful, I'm sure. Just
you dry your eyes. All will be well.

767
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,919
Thank you, sir.

768
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:05,093
I'll just... get this
business finished.

769
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:10,558
- How could you be so cruel?
- I only told her the new rules.

770
00:53:10,558 --> 00:53:13,304
- All containers to be opened.
- Yes, I know.

771
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:16,701
Do you smell it? I think in this
case we can make an exception.

772
00:53:16,702 --> 00:53:17,544
Whatever you say.

773
00:53:17,544 --> 00:53:18,767
- Nephew!
- Uncle.

774
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:19,800
Nephew,...

775
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:22,981
mind your duties. Open every parcel
and make no exception. No exception.

776
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,259
Yes, Uncle.

777
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:27,575
- What's that ungodly stink?
- The, er...

778
00:53:29,587 --> 00:53:32,332
- Scheduled for the morning train?
- Yes, Uncle.

779
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,894
- See that you open it.
- But, er... Uncle...

780
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:38,558
No stomach for it, eh?

781
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:40,651
Dear God, you're a delicate one.

782
00:53:40,923 --> 00:53:42,363
All right, I'll do it myself.

783
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:44,049
For opened it must be.

784
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:46,876
Oh! Oh!

785
00:53:46,876 --> 00:53:49,322
My dear brother! Oh,
Richard. Richard, he lives!

786
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,872
He lives! Oh, he's alive!

787
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:53,346
Oh, make haste. He's alive!
Oh, praise God, he's alive!

788
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:54,460
Oh, he's alive!

789
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:56,037
Hurry! Hurry! Lest we are too late.

790
00:53:56,037 --> 00:53:57,613
I knew it was not cholera!

791
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:58,620
Cholera?

792
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,931
He was a quack to say it.
I knew it! Hurry. Hurry.

793
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:04,383
- Five days I've waited to hear that bell.
- You say cholera? Five days?

794
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:06,422
Richard! Richard!

795
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,297
Ohh!

796
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,445
Oh, no!

797
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:18,981
Oh...

798
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:21,428
How can it be? I heard the bell.

799
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:23,276
Did you not?

800
00:54:23,277 --> 00:54:24,962
I heard it plain.

801
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,266
The bell rang.

802
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:28,958
No, missy. A gust of wind
or a tremor on the ground.

803
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:30,507
I'm sorry.

804
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:31,948
But I heard it.

805
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:33,905
Load this on. Sharp now!

806
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:35,373
Come along.

807
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:37,195
Steady. Steady now.

808
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,016
Stand aside there.

809
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,538
Careful.

810
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:42,033
That's right.

811
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:44,616
Over here. A little to
your right. Set it down.

812
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:48,041
- There's more colour to you now.
- Yes, I feel much better now, thank you.

813
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,345
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, miss.

814
00:54:49,346 --> 00:54:52,527
- All right for you. I'll be in here with it.
- Rather you than me, mate!

815
00:54:54,267 --> 00:54:55,952
Oh, the stench!

816
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:31,645
- Can you do it?
- I think so.

817
00:55:31,646 --> 00:55:33,005
It's a long way back there.

818
00:55:33,005 --> 00:55:35,940
Five carriages, 30 feet each,
that's 150 feet altogether.

819
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:36,918
I'll manage.

820
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:39,664
- You're not going to get killed, are you?
- Oh, I'd rather not.

821
00:55:39,855 --> 00:55:40,725
Edward!

822
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:43,443
- Edward Pierce, my dear fellow!
- Damn. Henry Fowler!

823
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:45,102
He cannot travel in
our compartment.

824
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:46,624
Henry, what a surprise!

825
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:48,826
- Fancy seeing you! Are you on this train?
- Yes.

826
00:55:48,827 --> 00:55:50,321
As a matter of fact, so am I.

827
00:55:51,544 --> 00:55:54,997
Oh, forgive me. Miss Bridget
Lawson, Mr Henry Fowler.

828
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:57,688
Miss Lawson is accompanying
her deceased brother but...

829
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,624
due to the new regulations she's
not permitted in the guard's van.

830
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,908
Therefore she is
seeking a compartment.

831
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,300
Well, mine is available.

832
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:08,426
Henry, you're so kind.

833
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:11,172
You won't join us, will you?

834
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:14,135
As a matter of fact, I've...
made other arrangements.

835
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:16,989
Oh, I see!

836
00:56:16,989 --> 00:56:19,354
- You're quite sure?
- Oh, yes.

837
00:56:19,354 --> 00:56:21,039
You carry on, Henry.

838
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,280
Miss Lawson!

839
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,428
- You're in capable hands.
- You're too kind.

840
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,385
Not at all.

841
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,438
Open up! Open up!

842
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:08,123
Open up, damn you!

843
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:10,134
Are you alive, then?

844
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,766
Of course I am, you damnable flat.

845
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:14,512
- Good God, he's alive!
- Open it! Hurry up. I must be quick!

846
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,964
Lift up!

847
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:19,650
Oh, mother of God!

848
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,552
Oh, the smell!

849
00:57:22,096 --> 00:57:23,781
The things I must do!

850
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:28,783
Do you have, er...
many gentlemen friends?

851
00:57:29,165 --> 00:57:32,453
Oh, why sure enough. Gents are
ever so friendly to me, they are.

852
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:34,628
- Me mum said I was a heartbreaker.
- I'm certain you are.

853
00:57:34,628 --> 00:57:38,542
Me mum was a heartbreaker herself.
Had many a caller, she did.

854
00:57:38,543 --> 00:57:40,119
Many a caller.

855
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:42,104
And always with some little token.

856
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:44,360
Me mum says a man loves
you, he shows you proper.

857
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,671
- With some little token.
- Quite so.

858
00:57:47,324 --> 00:57:50,259
If you will permit me, I should be
delighted to give you a "token" myself.

859
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:54,092
- Cor, you're a bold gent!
- I'm most serious, I assure you.

860
00:57:54,093 --> 00:57:56,294
- What, here on the train?
- Why not?

861
00:57:56,294 --> 00:57:58,740
Have you not heard of the
50-mile-an-hour club?

862
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,269
I'm told it's beneficial
to the circulation.

863
00:58:10,594 --> 00:58:12,659
- But the van's locked from outside.
- It's taken care of.

864
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,426
- How?
- You'll see soon enough.

865
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:17,144
My friend will come over the top of the
train between Redhill and Ashford.

866
00:58:17,144 --> 00:58:19,265
That's the fastest part of the run!

867
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:20,951
I suppose it is.

868
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:23,778
What about all them bridges?
Your friend, mate, he's mad.

869
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:08,757
- What's going on?
- Take the rope.

870
01:02:11,122 --> 01:02:12,671
- Is he up there now?
- He is.

871
01:02:12,672 --> 01:02:14,166
He's lucky to be alive.

872
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,722
- Hold on.
- All right.

873
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:23,273
Now let it go easy.

874
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,986
Go on.

875
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:49,343
I can't get over the feeling...

876
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,001
You look very familiar.

877
01:02:51,002 --> 01:02:53,883
- Are you sure we've never met?
- Oh, no, sir.

878
01:02:55,216 --> 01:02:56,656
What does your mum do?

879
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:58,477
Me mum? Er...

880
01:02:58,478 --> 01:03:00,163
She's a seamstress.

881
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:02,446
An honourable trade.

882
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,333
Me mum's made dresses for Lady
Eversham herself, I'll have you know.

883
01:03:07,748 --> 01:03:09,678
I'm acquainted with Lady Eversham.

884
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:11,716
Oh.

885
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:36,073
- All done?
- Done.

886
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:38,547
Good. We've got less than a minute.

887
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:46,376
Bloody hell, you look a sight!

888
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:47,708
I look a sight?

889
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,720
No, but you're all covered in soot.

890
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:52,764
It's the smoke.

891
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:55,157
- I haven't brought a change of clothing.
- That's brilliant.

892
01:03:55,157 --> 01:03:58,256
What are you going to wear
coming off Folkestone station?

893
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:00,431
Oh, no!

894
01:04:00,431 --> 01:04:01,980
Oh, no!

895
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,840
Bloody hell! You paint me green, make
me lie in a coffin with a dead cat...

896
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:07,444
and now you strip
me bollock-naked. No!

897
01:04:07,445 --> 01:04:08,749
- Shut up.
- Bloody hell!

898
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,217
Let's go!

899
01:04:22,396 --> 01:04:25,223
He'll take the river road
and meet us in Folkestone.

900
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:34,765
Take hold of the rope. We'll be
through Ashford soon. Pull it.

901
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:38,789
We'll pass Ashford soon.

902
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,192
Best lock me up.

903
01:06:07,328 --> 01:06:10,183
- Sweet dreams.
- Not bloody likely.

904
01:06:21,355 --> 01:06:25,134
Me mum told me the best gents were the
ones to watch. Full of tricks, they are.

905
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:30,000
I knew of one caller, wanted me to come
to a room he had, full of whips and such.

906
01:06:30,136 --> 01:06:31,331
- Whips?
- Mm!

907
01:06:31,332 --> 01:06:32,745
Can you imagine!

908
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:33,941
Mmm.

909
01:06:33,942 --> 01:06:36,987
- Well, me mum, she told me...
- My dear, my dear, my dearest!

910
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:38,100
Oh!

911
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:39,787
What a man you are!

912
01:06:40,603 --> 01:06:41,852
What do you take me for?

913
01:06:41,853 --> 01:06:43,456
Aagh!

914
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,419
Ohh!

915
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:24,777
Impossible woman!

916
01:07:37,363 --> 01:07:37,960
Ha!

917
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:40,354
Robbery indeed! The very idea!

918
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:35,484
Arrest that man!

919
01:08:54,866 --> 01:08:57,394
The court thanks you for providing
us with so clear an explanation...

920
01:08:57,394 --> 01:08:59,134
of your manner in
committing the crime.

921
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,608
I'm glad to be of help. The
police seemed to be confused.

922
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:04,081
Do spare us your impoverished
witticisms, Mr Pierce.

923
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:06,283
Your presence here attests
to their efficiency.

924
01:09:06,284 --> 01:09:08,213
You know, you are a
very unusual man.

925
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:10,253
Mr Pierce, I put it
to you directly.

926
01:09:10,389 --> 01:09:12,944
Did you never feel at any time
some sense of impropriety,...

927
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:14,684
some recognition of misconduct,...

928
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:18,516
some comprehension of unlawful
behaviour, some moral misgivings...

929
01:09:18,517 --> 01:09:21,371
in the performance of these
various and sundry criminal acts?

930
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:24,280
- I don't understand the question.
- Evidently not.

931
01:09:24,335 --> 01:09:26,917
Sir, it is a recognised
truth of jurisprudence...

932
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,711
that laws are created by men...

933
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:31,348
and that civilised men, in a tradition
of more than two millennia,...

934
01:09:31,348 --> 01:09:34,799
agree to abide by these laws for
the common good of all society.

935
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,104
For it is only by
the rule of law...

936
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:40,536
that any civilisation holds itself above
the promiscuous squalor of barbarism.

937
01:09:40,537 --> 01:09:42,847
Now, on the matter
of motive, we ask you:

938
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:45,678
why did you conceive,
plan and execute...

939
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,218
this dastardly and
scandalous crime?

940
01:09:51,547 --> 01:09:53,232
I wanted the money.

941
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:01,550
He'll get 20 years for that.

942
01:10:32,514 --> 01:10:34,334
What the hell are you waiting for?
