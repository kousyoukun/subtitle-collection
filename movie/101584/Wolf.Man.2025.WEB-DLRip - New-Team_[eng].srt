00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,876
It doesn't.
I just wanted to tell you.

171
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,420
I'm serious.

172
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,672
Eh, this feels
very transactional.

173
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,299
I don't know what that means.

174
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,303
Hey, get down.

175
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,763
Ginger.

176
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,890
Get down right now.

177
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,600
Okay, that's it, no ice cream

178
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,145
in three, two, one.

179
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,106
No, the dog don't jump off
the motherfucking leash!

180
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,192
- Hey, hey, hey.
- (man grunts)

181
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,487
I told you to get down.

182
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,948
Why didn't you listen to me,
damn it?

183
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,035
Why didn't you listen to me?

184
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,038
(Ginger's breath trembling)

185
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,003
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,755
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

187
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,006
That's not me.

188
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,591
I don't want to be like that.

189
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,927
I just need you to listen
when I tell you something.

190
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,805
'Cause what's my job?

191
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,016
To keep your daughter safe.

192
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,517
Yeah. That's right.

193
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,061
And what's your job?

194
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,856
(sighs)
To read minds.

195
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,569
Can you guess what I'm thinking
right now?

196
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,532
"I love my little girl."

197
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,367
That's amazing.

198
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,911
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

199
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,204
How do you do that every time?

200
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,039
You're so good at your job.
(kissing)

201
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,291
Okay.

202
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,376
I'm sorry. You scared me, okay?

203
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,045
- You owe me a dollar.
- Why?

204
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,338
Because you sweared.

205
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,881
No, I didn't.
You're hearing things.

206
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,466
I'm not, Daddy. You sweared.

207
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,677
(slow jazz music playing
in distance)

208
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,513
(jazz music continues)

209
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,306
Okay, now let me put
some on you.

210
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,476
Oh, my God. Okay, do it quickly.

211
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,896
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm. Good?

212
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,482
- Yeah.
- How's this?

213
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,360
(laughing):
You look creepy.

214
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,528
You mean like this?

215
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,570
(laughing)

216
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,030
- You mean like this, Ginger?
- Dad.

217
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,699
- (barking, growling)
- (laughing)

218
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,034
No, uh, yeah. No, I get that.

219
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,162
BLAKE:
Okay, go sit at the table.

220
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,249
No, but I-I have,
I have a second source.

221
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,960
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

222
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,294
(whispers):
One minute.

223
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,754
Well, are you gonna ship it

224
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,132
or you gonna let the Times
scoop us again?

225
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,758
- (whispers): Hi.
- Hi, Mommy.

226
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,760
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

227
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,680
CHARLOTTE:
Well, so we have a deal then?

228
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,849
What-- This is bullshit.

229
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,310
You've never asked
for this before.

230
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,645
Uh, in the time it takes
to do all of this,

231
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,064
we could've gotten ahead
of everybody.

232
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,900
But I just don't think
we need to do it.

233
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,946
I promise from now on.
Can you just get it online?

234
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,115
- Take that in the other room.
- Shh.

235
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,783
(over phone):
I shouldn't be doing this.

236
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,368
Are you doing it or not?

237
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,996
Charlotte, can you take that
in the other room?

238
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,581
Listen, I-I know what I'm doing.

239
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,127
You know I know because
you taught me how to do it.

240
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,753
(over phone):
Goodbye, Charlotte.

241
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,965
Okay. Bye.

242
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,469
(sighs)

243
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,471
Can you, um...

244
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,309
Can you not do that, please?

245
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,768
What did I do?

246
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,021
I was having an important
conversation with my editor.

247
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,606
Yeah, 'cause you're the only one

248
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,065
that has important stuff
going on, right?

249
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,775
I'm not busy at all.

250
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,486
If I ever have kids, I'm never
gonna fight in front of them.

251
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,988
BLAKE:
We're not fighting, honey.

252
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,450
We're having
a spirited exchange.

253
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,580
BLAKE:
Okay.

254
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,666
So, um...

255
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,963
I just found out my dad has
been finally declared deceased.

256
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,218
Officially,
by the state of Oregon.

257
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,597
Um, I'm sorry.

258
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,267
It's okay.

259
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,937
How do you feel?

260
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,773
I mean, we knew this letter
was coming one day.

261
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,234
But the finality of it...

262
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,737
Yeah, I don't know,
it's still shocking.

263
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,822
Yeah.

264
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,493
Are you sad, Daddy?

265
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,579
(exhales)

266
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,581
I am, yeah.

267
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,166
I'm sad about a lot of things.

268
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,335
I wish I'd known him better.

269
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,837
But he always made me
afraid of him,

270
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,133
so as soon as I was old enough,
I left.

271
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,011
We hadn't spoken in a long time

272
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,389
because I chose not to.

273
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,352
Um, and now that
I can't speak to him...

274
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,523
...I suddenly want to.

275
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,156
(distant siren wailing)

276
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,741
CHARLOTTE:
The whole day.

277
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,119
No way. The whole thing
felt ridiculous, you know?

278
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,080
(chuckling)

279
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,164
Oh.

280
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,374
(Charlotte chuckles)

281
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,168
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

282
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,795
Yeah.

283
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,839
Hey.

284
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,426
Hey.

285
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,845
This is a surprise.

286
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,515
I brought you some lunch.

287
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,267
Thank you.

288
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,602
We haven't done this in a while.

289
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
Yeah.

290
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,493
Are you happy, Charlotte?

291
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,371
Yeah.

292
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,166
Yeah.

293
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,417
Are-are you?

294
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,587
Why-why are you asking me that?

295
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,634
Because I don't think
we're doing well right now.

296
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,392
I came here because

297
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,188
when I got that letter...

298
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,024
...it dawned on me

299
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,196
that you and Ginger are the
only family that I have left.

300
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,242
We have such a short amount
of time with people.

301
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:26,748
I just want us
to enjoy each other

302
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:31,629
and try to be happy as a family
while we are here.

303
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,217
I want to be happy, too, but...

304
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,428
(sighs)

305
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,228
I was thinking you should
come up to Oregon with me.

306
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,522
I have to go up there

307
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,942
and pack up all my dad's stuff
in a truck.

308
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,695
Why don't we all go together?

309
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,407
We'd spend the whole summer
up there.

310
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,660
I think it'd be good for us.

311
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,582
It really is stunning.

312
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,045
There's this valley
not far from the farm.

313
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,590
It's between these mountains.

314
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,302
And no matter
how many times you see it,

315
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,349
the view makes you feel like
everything's gonna be okay.

316
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,768
I want you and Ginger to see it.

317
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,647
It sounds nice,
but I can't just leave work.

318
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,024
No, yeah,
but you can work remotely.

319
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,526
Just take some time off.

320
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,694
Ginger would love that.

321
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,070
You could spend some time
with her.

322
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,406
You can work on your book.

323
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,450
Yeah, I don't...

324
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,536
I don't even know
if I'm good at that anymore.

325
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,582
You're a great writer. Come on.

326
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,920
I meant at spending time
with my daughter.

327
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,008
(breathes deeply)

328
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,136
She...

329
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,763
She relates to you
so much more than me.

330
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,266

Oh, are you a deer?

BLAKE:
No. I just don't know what...

356
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,509
Don't know the answer.

357
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,678
- No, I'm a fawn.
- A fawn?

358
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,096
- Yeah.
- I said deer.

359
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,473
- A fawn is not a deer.
- CHARLOTTE: It's-it's...

360
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,684
- It's not. -What?
It's literally a baby deer.

00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,977
GINGER:
It's not.

362

And fawns live in the forest.
Hello.

00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,479
They do sometimes, but sometimes

364
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,897
they're in people's
backyards, so...

Oh, you are a cheater.
You know what?

367
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,694
- That's it. You know what's
coming? -Don't, Daddy. Stop.

00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,028

- CHARLOTTE: Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

369
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,697
- Tell Daddy he's being immature.
- Uh-oh.

370
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,866
Hey, hey, I can be
just as immature as he can.

371
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,326
Mommy, stop it. Stop, Mommy.

I'm so mature?

Please, Mommy, stop it.

- Sorry, honey. Shivers.

380

Let me check the map here.

381
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,062
I have no service.

00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,147
Me, either.

Can I see?

387
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,413
There's someone
in that tree house.

388
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,748
Where?

389
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,999
GINGER:
Over there.

390
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,836
She's right-- there's someone
inside that thing.

BLAKE:
Oh.

392

Uh, let's go, Blake.

BLAKE:
No, it's okay.

394
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,559
No, he has a gun.

395
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,561
Charlotte,
everyone around here has a gun.

396
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,731
Blake, can-can you just
please drive?

397
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,153
- MAN: Evening.
- BLAKE: Hey.

398
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,113
Where you guys headed?

399
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,324
Uh, I'm looking
for my dad's farm.

400
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,619
I just, I haven't been up here
in a while. I forgot...

401
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,329
Who's your dad?

402
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,040
Uh... Grady.

403
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,793
Lovell.

404
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,797
You've been gone
a long time, Blake.

405
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,132
Wait, do I... do I know you?

406
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,550
(man chuckles)

407
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,470
I'm Derek. I'm Dan Kiel's son.

408
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,472
Right.

409
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,474
Oh, Derek. Shit.

410
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,810
- GINGER: Dad.
- Oh, sorry.

411
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,103
BLAKE:
Yeah, no, I remember you.

412
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,564
How are you?
It's good to see you.

413
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,650
Not many of us left
living up here anymore.

414
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,818
(Blake and Derek laugh)

415
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,695
Not really a part of the world.

416
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,948
Yeah. I-I'd agree with that.

417
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,785
You might not remember this,
but, uh, for the most part,

418
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,870
we don't like to be out
after dark on the mountain.

419
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,330
There's no power grid,
no lights.

420
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,083
BLAKE: Oh. I-I thought
that was just my dad.

421
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,919
Uh, you know, I'm actually
a little lost.

422
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,006
You know, I-I was sure
that this was his driveway.

423
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,509
It's not.

424
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,969
Really?

425
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,638
It's mine.

426
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,057
Oh.

427
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,017
Yeah, okay.

428
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,269
Well, sorry.

429
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,147
The usual road to Grady's
is cut off.

430
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,191
I'll take you there,
get you settled in quicker.

431
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,359
(Derek sniffles)

432
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,445
Okay.

00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,904
(footfalls)

434
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,948
Blake, no. No, absolutely not.

435
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,533
- It's fine. Let him show us.
- No, he...

436
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,201
Why can't he just
tell us where it is?

437
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,911
- He's standing there now.
- What, so...

438
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,204
- Just open the door, Char.
- What are you talk...

439
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,664
- He's opening it.
- Well, stop...

440
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,542
(laughs nervously):
Hi. Hi.

441
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,044
(laughs nervously)
Hi. Uh, no, no, no.

442
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,882
It's okay.
I-I'll just go to the back.

443
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,219
Thank you, ma'am.

444
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,723
- Watch your feet.
- (door closes)

445
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,313
- Just go straight on a ways.
- (door closes)

446
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,231
Hey there, cutie.

447
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,359
BLAKE: Uh, Derek, that's Ginger
and my wife Charlotte.

448
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,736
Hi.

449
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,072

450
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,333
(insects chirring)

451
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,215
How long you planning
on staying?

452
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,927
- CHARLOTTE: Not too long.
- BLAKE: A little while.

453
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,561
It's definitely
an acquired taste.

454
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:50,107
There are things you have to
come to terms with up here.

455
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,443
Animals.

456
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,613
Diseases.

457
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,785
Well, we're,
we're pretty tough people.

458
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,331
Is that so?

459
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,710
To me, you don't seem so tough.

460
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,005
That's a good thing.

461
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,633
Means you got a good life.

462
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,345
You're healthy, safe.

463
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,144
Your dad's place
is just up ahead.

464
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,814
What do you do
for a living, Blake?

465
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,315
I'm a writer.

466
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,735
I'm between jobs
right now, though.

467
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,823
So... I'm a dad

468
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,076
to that monster in the back.

469
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,332
(laughs softly)

470
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,002
I'm a journalist.

471
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,849
(laughs softly)

472
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,269
I bet you look at them every day
and wonder how you got so lucky

473
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,898
to have such a smart
and beautiful family.

474
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,277
I do.

475
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,654
- (tires screeching)
- Shit.

476
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,198
(Charlotte screaming)

477
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,083
(tree crashing)

478
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,004

Oh.

483
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,098
- Oh.
- (Ginger whimpering)

484
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,142
Ginger? Are you okay?

485
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,393
GINGER:
I'm okay.

486
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,520
Char, are you okay?

487
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,397
- Hey, are you hurt anywhere?
- (loud crashing)

488
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,900
Are you okay? Ginger?

489
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,360
Charlotte, are you hurt?

490
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,404
- CHARLOTTE: No.
- BLAKE: Huh?

491
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,697
- Derek, are you okay?
- (Derek wailing)

492
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,199
BLAKE:
