1
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,510
Dock five, the <i>Immaculata?</i>

2
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,995
It's over there!

3
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,076
Oh!

4
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,790
I cannot, I repeat, cannot

5
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,754
sit in this cesspool by the sea
with nothing to do.

6
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,158
So, while you repair your silly boat
engines, I will do some remodelling.

7
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,239
- I've sent for a carpenter.
- Whatever, diddums. I'm shooting skeet.

8
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,357
Hello!

9
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,717
Mr Stayton? Anybody home?

10
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,834
- Hello!
- State your purpose!

11
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,191
- Nice-looking Wetherby you got.
- It's a very expensive gun.

12
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
- I have lots and lots of them.
- Somebody call for a carpenter?

13
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,112
That's my wife's department.

14
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,708
Could you tell me
where your wife might... be?

15
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,228
You're the carpenter?

16
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,870
Yeah. Dean Proffitt.

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,956
You're late.

18
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,430
- References?
- Well, no, not really.

19
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,835
You see, I just moved up to this area...

20
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,350
Hey, I've been doing this kind
of shit - work - for years.

21
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,233
This is... This is just beautiful. Wow!

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,108
- Try not to touch anything.
- Oh, I won't.

23
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,275
Andrew will keep an eye on you.

24
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,359
Maybe you'd like to take fingerprints
before I get started.

25
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,436
I was just... kidding.

26
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,319
Don't walk so close to me!

27
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,192
OK! Where's your problem?

28
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,038
- My closet.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,036
In here.

30
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,598
Now, you can see
how inadequate this all is.

31
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,359
I need new shoe racks for my shoes.

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,916
Uh, excuse me. I was told that
this was some kind of an emergency.

33
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,235
It is.

34
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,430
And I need drawers for my lingerie.

35
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,473
I can't keep entering
these boxes all the time.

36
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,033
Hello?

37
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,716
Uh... Hey, I'm sorry. I understand now.
You want me to remodel your closet.

38
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,109
Isn't that what I've been explaining
in some detail?

39
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,276
Is English your second language?

40
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,276
What is that odour?

41
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,396
I don't smell anything.

42
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,553
Madam.

43
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,271
Well! I almost had to wait.

44
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,911
I got an idea for a shoe rack
right in here maybe, huh?

45
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,714
What <i>is</i> this gelatinous muck?!

46
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,432
Andrew, when I tell you to pack staples,

47
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,953
must I specify that you are to pack
good caviar and not this $1.99 fish bait!

48
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,629
- Yes, madam.
- Caviar should be round and hard

49
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,910
and of adequate size.

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,274
And it should burst in your mouth
at <i>precisely</i> the right moment.

51
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,515
Yes, madam.

52
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,437
- Carpenter!
- Yeah?

53
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,791
You have exactly 48 hours.
I suggest you get started.

54
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,392
- Throw that out.
- Yes, madam.

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,356
Watch him.

56
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,074
<i>Mais oui! Bien sur!</i>

57
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,309
<i>Oui?</i>

58
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,795
<i>Ecoutez, Jean-Jacques</i>.
<i>Je vous telephone</i>...

59
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,593
Oh, boy. She is really something!

60
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,632
I know it will cost me,
but it's the cutest little painting.

61
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,752
I simply must have it.
You'll do the bidding for me?

62
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,393
But of course(!)

63
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,432
- Bid 1,700,000.
- Shit!

64
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,872
Grant, I'm on the phone!

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,037
I can't hear you, tea rose!
I'm shooting skeet!

66
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,709
- Pull!
- Pull!

67
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,432
Firing!

68
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,915
Hello.

69
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,597
Forks were invented so man
could at least make a pretence

70
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,474
- of separating himself from the apes.
- So were thumbs.

71
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,671
- What did you say?
- Nothin'. Just... my stomach.

72
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,749
Well, try to control your bodily noises
so I can hear myself think!

73
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,754
<i>And another</i>
<i>Oregon good morning to you</i>.

74
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,155
<i>Wilbur Budd here with some local items</i>.

75
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,592
<i>The Fraga Feed and Fertilizer folks</i>
<i>are hiring people to shovel the stuff</i>.

76
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,157
<i>Oh, women are welcome, too. There's</i>
<i>no chauvinism in the manure business</i>.

77
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,917
These gnats keep landing
on my wet nail polish.

78
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,033
I guess I'm supposed to walk around with
their little corpses stuck to my fingers.

79
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,355
- Joanna, please!
- It's easy for you to say!

80
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,359
You don't have to sit out here in the brine
with your perm frizzing to oblivion.

81
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,357
I look like a bushman.

82
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,552
Why don't you go inside
and get out of the sea air?

83
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,912
Because that Elk Snout mountain man
is still working on my closet.

84
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,996
He's sweating all over the place.

85
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,076
I doubt if he's even housebroken.

86
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,112
- Oh, I think they housebreak each other...
- Ssh!

87
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,596
- What?
- He's listening.

88
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,711
- Who?
- That carpenter.

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,912
He's been hanging on our every word
for the last two days.

90
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,873
It's your project, Joanna. You deal with it.

91
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,194
- Come along, men.
- The engines are ready, sir.

92
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,276
Well, let's get going.

93
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,796
I've finished, madam.
Shall I put your jewellery back on you?

94
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,955
No.

95
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,551
I'm still tacky.

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,359
Keep quiet for ten more minutes, collect
the money and get the hell outta here.

97
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,675
Well! Are we amusing you?

98
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,155
- What... is this?
- Uh, well, I'm done. I'm finished.

99
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,555
- Uh... What do you think?
- What is it?

100
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,797
Well, it's a shoe rack... with a twist.
Uh... You ready?

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,675
Just turn the crank here, those drop back,
these split. Gives you twice the space...

102
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,712
Stop boring me with your absurdities.
What's it made of?

103
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,796
It's called wood. It's oak.

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,195
Oak. An oak closet?

105
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,197
Huh! Why am I even amazed?

106
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,515
I don't know. Why are you amazed?

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,430
One would think you would know closets
are made of cedar. If not, we get moths.

108
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,269
Well, lady, there's not a real big
moth problem off the Pacific coast.

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,676
But if you want one out of cedar,
that's fine. I'll start all over.

110
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,395
I just have to tell ya that's gonna
more than double my estimate.

111
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,116
- What do you mean?
- I've already done this out of oak, so...

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,279
- I'm not paying for your mistake!
- I'm not just gonna eat it on this deal.

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,595
Why not?
You've eaten everything else here.

114
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,790
And you will eat it
because I wanted cedar!

115
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,559
You may have <i>wanted</i> cedar,
but you didn't <i>ask</i> for it.

116
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,513
The entire civilised world
knows closets are made of cedar!

117
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,791
In Elk Snout,
we don't know about them closets!

118
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,913
Nor bathrooms, neither! Shit, woman!
You're lucky I <i>am</i> housebroke!

119
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,758
- You were listening.
- Well, it was kinda hard to avoid.

120
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,190
- You can avoid it now - you're fired!
- You're unbelievable!

121
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,869
That's fine with me!
Just pay me the money you owe me.

122
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,630
- The job was not done to my satisfaction!
- I got news for you, lady!

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,149
No job will ever be done
to your satisfaction!

124
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,236
That's quite enough! Now, just get out!

125
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,033
No problem! Pay me the <i>6</i>00 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone!

126
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,116
Captain Karl! Start up the engine!

127
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,911
You know what your problem is? Huh?

128
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,271
You're so goddamn bored,
you gotta invent things to bitch about.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,312
You haven't got a single thing to do
except for your hair.

130
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,192
Yeah! The closet was fine!

131
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,357
You just needed somethin'
to take up your useless, empty,

132
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,712
nail-polishing, toe-polishing,
rich-bitch, sun tanning days!

133
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,836
- Don't touch me!
- What?

134
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,915
Hey, lady.

135
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,909
I may be hard up, but I am not that
hard up. And I'm not goin' anywhere...

136
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,516
Hey!

137
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,116
- Damn you!
- Man overboard!

138
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,196
I'll get you for this, you...

139
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,756
Not my tool belt! You owe me <i>6</i>00 bucks!

140
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,879
- Keep going!
- As you wish.

141
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,638
If I ever get you, lady, you're dead meat!
You got that?

142
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,716
No, don't throw that!

143
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,519
I'm not bored! I'm quite happy!

144
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,596
Everyone wants to be me!

145
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,993
You come back here!

146
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,071
I lost all my tools.

147
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,192
I'll loan you some tools.
We'll get you some part-time work.

148
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,118
I need a steady job.
What about that night-time thing?

149
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,358
I'm working on it. Listen, pretty soon,
we'll get that miniature golf course deal.

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,436
If I can hang on that long.

151
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,556
He called you a what?

152
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,797
Joanna, why are you so upset?

153
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,710
Why in the world do you care what some
carpenter from Elk Snout thinks of you?

154
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,196
I'm sure I'm just premenstrual.

155
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,279
Then you must go right back to bed
for at least two days.

156
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,356
Inga, you don't shove the food
down Shiitake's throat.

157
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,439
You place it on her tongue.
Don't they have dogs in Sweden?

158
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,836
Grant mentioned having a baby again.

159
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,716
<i>What should I do?</i>

160
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,196
<i>Darling, if you have a baby,</i>

161
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,276
you won't be the baby any more.

162
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,314
True.

163
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,352
<i>Well, I must go. Bye-bye, Mommy</i>.

164
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,072
Bye-bye, sweetie.

165
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,876
I'm not a bitch.

166
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,194
Andrew!
Are you going to bring me my lemon

167
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,993
or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

168
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,234
Hey, guys, I'm home!

169
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,469
Stay away, you wolves! No! Shoo!

170
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,556
Bad dogs! Go away!

171
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,717
Buster! Jackson! Get back inside!

172
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,196
- Are you Mr Proffitt?
- Yeah!

173
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,915
You look like the morning after
Halloween. Probably had a day like I did.

174
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,316
- What happened to you?
- Monday is their first day of school

175
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,718
and I came here to welcome your family.
And what do I get in return?

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,435
- I get toilet-papered by your children!
- They're just playin' around!

177
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,917
Just playin' around? They were about
to douse the toilet paper with gasoline

178
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,996
- and strike...
- Wait, wait! Stop.

179
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,270
- Greg and Charlie. Twins, right?
- Yeah.

180
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,518
They're having this arson period. They
don't know this, but I'm ahead of them.

181
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,870
I got two fire extinguishers ready to go.

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,355
- I didn't catch your name.
- Adele Burbridge.

183
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,675
- Nice to meet you.
- Principal of the Elk Cove school.

184
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,634
- Your children are monsters!
- You won't think that once you know 'em!

185
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,356
- Where is Mrs Proffitt during all of this?
- She died three years ago.

186
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,428
Mr Proffitt, your children are totally
lacking in parental supervision.

187
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,632
Hey, you don't have to tell <i>me</i>
these kids are lucky.

188
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,116
Fine. You can joke all you want,
but I am serious about this.

189
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,950
If you don't do something,
I am going to notify the proper authorities.

190
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,277
I have had baby-sitters in here
by the dozen, but...

191
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,356
I'm... I'm kinda low on cash right now.

192
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,519
I'm new in town, but if I get a chance
I'll hire a housekeeper, all right?

193
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,518
I'll believe it when I see it.
Good day, Mr Proffitt!

194
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,236
I'm a good father!

195
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,516
Ah, what do you know?

196
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,154
Joanna, I want you tonight.

197
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,953
How can you have your period
every week?!

198
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,870
<i>You can stow away with the rich</i>
<i>and famous to exotic ports of call</i>...

199
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,349
Must you watch that thing incessantly?

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,951
Yes, I must. It has a tawdry escapist
quality that soothes my nerves.

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,470
What you have to escape from,
I can't possibly imagine.

202
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,392
Grant! I left my wedding ring on the deck.

203
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,876
- Well, what can <i>I</i> do?
- Go and get it.

204
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,436
- It's after midnight!
- I don't care what time it is. I want it now!

205
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,677
I want to see who's in the top ten yachts.

206
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,234
- I'll get it!
- OK.

207
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,712
<i>A countdown to the world's</i>
<i>ten best luxury yachts</i>.

<i>Number nine, the 230</i>...

213
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,436
Andrew!

214
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,999
Grant!

215
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,117
Oh, my hair!

216
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,559
Help!

217
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,598
Grant! Help!

218
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,191
Stop! You idiots!

219
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,192
Another Oregon good morning to you!
This is Wilbur Budd here at KRAB,

220
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,029
the family station,
run by me and my family.

221
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,039
Sorry to interrupt the movie, but we got
some excitement in Tillamook County.

222
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,789
I've got a bulletin for the eyewitness,
on-the-spot KRAB newsroom.

223
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,036
It seems a mystery woman
was picked up

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,197
by the Elk Cove garbage scow
shortly after midnight.

225
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,073
They fished her out of the water
and she's conscious,

226
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,192
but the problem is she seems
to be suffering from amnesia.

227
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,709
She has no recollection of who she is.

228
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,638
<i>My wife Rose is with</i>
<i>the captain of the garbage scow</i>

229
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,591
<i>that picked up the mystery lady</i>.

230
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,551
- <i>Rose?</i>
- Mr Tunatti.

231
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,639
Can you tell us what the woman was like
when you brought her aboard?

232
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,151
Yes. We saw something float in water
like this. Just like that, just like that.

233
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,431
We didn't know it... We bring... on board.

234
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,199
- On board.
- Yes. We say... <i>foca!</i>

235
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,515
Excuse me,
you can't say that on television!

236
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,392
No, no, no, no!

237
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,080
<i>Foca! Foca!</i>
<i>Foca</i> means seal in <i>portugues!</i>

238
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,350
- Oh, I see!
- Seal, seal! So we bring...

239
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,756
- You learn something every day!
- No clothes. Just a little thing.

240
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,078
- <i>There you have it. Thank you, Tunatti</i>.
- <i>Thank you</i>.

241
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,156
<i>Garbage I do for money. For love, I sing</i>.

242
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,669
- <i>In my country, I sing</i>.
- <i>Isn't that interesting?</i>

243
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,475
- <i>We have a Renaissance garbageman</i>.
- <i>We tell stories with our songs</i>.

244
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,352
<i>Thank you, Rose</i>.

245
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,552
<i>Arnie, can we roll that tape now, please?</i>

246
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,113
<i>Now, folks. Here's an interview</i>
<i>we taped earlier at the hospital</i>.

247
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,038
<i>Miss, miss</i>... <i>do you know your name?</i>

248
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,116
<i>Of course I know my name!</i>

249
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,632
<i>It's</i>...

250
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,716
<i>Oh! This is absurd!</i>

251
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,356
<i>I know it! It</i>...

252
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,876
<i>Get that thing out of my face!</i>

253
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,076
<i>What a horrible wig!</i>

254
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,192
You mean to tell me
that I have no medical recourse?

255
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,434
- Can she see us?
- Not unless she's Superwoman.

256
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,429
Well, what do you know? Extend
your brain a teensy little bit, if possible!

257
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,950
You seem to be suffering
from a temporary amnesia,

258
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,119
either from the bump into the garbage
scow or the shock of the cold water.

259
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,708
- How temporary is it?
- Well, we don't know.

260
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,798
Otherwise, you seem to be
in excellent physical shape.

261
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,876
Listen to me, medical people.

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,118
As of now, I have a life history
of a dirty garbage scow

263
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,596
and a breakfast of
extremely runny eggs over easy!

264
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,871
Now I refuse... refuse...

265
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,951
to be incarcerated in this
semi-private room!

266
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,877
You snore!

267
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,468
No efforts are being made
for anyone to locate...

268
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,589
Is that her?

269
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,552
<i>I demand you do something!</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

270
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,035
No! I never saw her before in my life.

271
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,509
Mrs Stayton has decided
to leave me. Let's celebrate!

272
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,639
Now, Miss, uh... X, we have
a comfortable private room for you

273
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,356
where you'll be safer, we'll all be safer,
and you'll be a lot more comfortable.

274
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,790
Well, I'm glad you've <i>finally</i>
come to your senses!

275
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,831
I was prepared to sue you.

276
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,918
I don't know who I am,
but I'm sure I have a lawyer.

277
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,955
- Hey, you about done?
- Yeah! I think I got it fixed.

278
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,958
- Your lunch is on the counter.
- Thanks.

279
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,355
<i>Hi, this is Wilbur Budd</i>.
<i>We got some more</i>

280
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,597
<i>on that amnesia lady story</i>
<i>down there in Elk Grove</i>.

281
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,676
<i>Wanna push in on these, Barry, please?</i>

282
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,156
Uh, I saw some potato chips
around the corner. Could I just...?

283
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,236
OK, one bag!

284
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,354
<i>I said Elk Grove before. You know</i>
<i>I meant Elk Cove. Anything new, honey?</i>

285
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,268
<i>The mystery woman is still suffering</i>
<i>from complete but temporary amnesia</i>.

286
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,871
<i>If you know the identity of this</i>
<i>woman, please contact Elk Cove Hospital</i>.

287
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,992
<i>I'll put up the reward myself</i>.
<i>She's drivin' us crazy</i>.

288
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,156
- <i>Thank you. Back to Wilbur</i>...
- Yo, Dean!

289
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,990
- <i>She's not the nicest person around</i>...
- Look at this!

290
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,590
<i>She made some remarks about</i>
<i>Rose's hair, which I didn't care for</i>.

291
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,632
<i>In any event, there she is</i>
<i>and this is what she looks like</i>.

292
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,273
- That's her.
- Who?

293
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,152
The bitch!

294
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,876
<i>Earlier today, one man arrived on</i>
<i>the scene to make an identification, but</i>...

295
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,912
I can't believe it. He's skippin' out on her.

296
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,679
Course he is! It's his shot at freedom.

297
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,234
We should go and see
if we can get your money back.

298
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,316
- Look, he's gone!
- Not him, her!

299
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,031
She doesn't know who she is. Do you
think she's gonna know who I am?

300
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,917
- Billy, there is a God and he loves me.
- You're not gonna shave your head?

301
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,268
No.

302
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,836
- Dean...
- I gotta go talk to my kids.

303
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,520
I want you to take 'em shopping
at the Salvation Army.

304
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,790
This is illegal! Dean, you're crazy!

305
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,635
I wondered if a woman like that
had a husband.

306
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,275
- Oh, yeah! She does!
- Here's some effects you may recognise.

307
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,435
Oh, yeah.

308
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,109
Nice panties. Some initials here,
she didn't know what they meant. JS.

309
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,835
She wouldn't cos, see,
I bought these for her at a garage sale.

310
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,032
- I bought my wife a garter at a yard sale.
- I bet you did.

311
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,038
- Hey, what else you got in here?
- I got some pictures.

312
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,515
We were gonna wire them,
but now you're here...

313
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,790
Yeah! That's her.

314
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,670
Oh, yeah. That's my little cookie-cutter.

315
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,030
- Quite a beauty!
- She's somethin', isn't she?

316
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,435
You got that right!

317
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,437
Doc. We got a winner.

318
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,273
Annie!

319
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,356
Stop!

320
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,397
I don't recognise this man.

321
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,080
Your wife's had an almost
total loss of memory.

322
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,795
I-I can't believe
she doesn't know her own husband!

323
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,074
This missing-link person
is not my husband!

324
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,475
Oh, Annie, please!

325
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,558
- Annie. Annie.
- Right.

326
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,557
That's not right. That's not my name!

327
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,831
This is completely crazy! Honey, sit down.

328
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,158
Everything's gonna be OK.
Now... I <i>am</i> your husband.

329
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,236
My name is Dean Proffitt.

330
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,436
We've been married for 13 years.

331
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,118
Wait!

332
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,596
I admit I have forgotten numerous things.

333
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,395
But I truly, from the depths of my soul,
do not remember you!

334
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,273
Don't you think
there'd be some spark of recognition?

335
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,551
- We don't know.
- Maybe you'll spark to this!

336
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,355
Ugh! I don't believe this!
He could be some stranger off the street!

337
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,755
Well, he seems to like you
and he's a nice guy.

338
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,393
- He's good-lookin'.
- Clean.

339
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,116
- What's my full name?
- Oh, come on!

340
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,595
- What is it?
- Mrs Annie Proffitt!

341
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,269
- What's my maiden name?
- Annie... Goolihy.

342
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,196
Annie Goolihy?

343
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,550
Where in God's name did I grow up?
Dogpatch?

344
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,595
No, no, not there! Over in Goober, Idaho.
But it's a nuclear waste dump now...

345
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,109
- Where did I meet you?
- Hank's Donut World.

346
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,596
Seattle? You hung out there every night
when you were in the Navy!

347
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,950
- You remember...
- I was in the armed forces?

348
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,435
I've still got your postcards
from Okinawa...

349
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,120
Stop. The Navy?

350
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,673
Oh, come on, honey!

351
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,870
You gotta know! You were in the Navy!

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,675
No, I don't know! I don't know
any of this and I don't know you!

353
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,716
I need some proof!

354
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,516
Stop staring at me!

355
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,156
Eat your chequers!

356
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,308
Look, if it were up to us, we'd be glad
to give her to you, but she's right.

357
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,351
I'm gonna need some verification.

358
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,756
Oh, listen... I know what you mean.
I understand. Now...

359
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,633
I don't like to talk about this in public,
and I've never told anybody...

360
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,959
She does have a small
strawberry-like birthmark, uh...

361
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,355
It's kinda high up on her... left cheek

362
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,233
and it's unique.

363
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,110
Come to Daddy!

364
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,708
Mister!
What was I doing out in the ocean?

365
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,836
Um... That's something you like to do.
You know, divin' for oysters at night.

366
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,236
Sometimes you get pretty far
from the shore and that undertow...

367
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,478
Oysters? In a cold ocean at night?
That doesn't sound like me.

368
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,756
I just... ate a bug!

369
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,958
Keep your mouth closed!
A lot of things flying around out here.

370
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,828
Welcome home, baby!

371
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,516
I feel faint.

372
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,629
Come on, Buster! Come on, Jackson!

373
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,874
No. This is wrong.

374
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,958
Come along, now.
We've only been here a couple of weeks.

375
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,108
A lot of stuff's in boxes from the move,
so I hardly recognise the place myself.

376
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,198
We moved here... deliberately?

377
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,916
Our last place was a real dump.

378
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,715
Come on.

379
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,990
Our new palace!

380
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,708
Well!

381
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,674
Let me, uh... Let me show you around.
Maybe something'll come back to you.

382
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,636
- Did I just go downhill?
- Look at that. It's comin' back already.

383
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,354
Everything slants down here
toward the bedroom.

384
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,029
Dining room and toilet... Only one.

385
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,874
And here we are at the old,
uh... magic room.

386
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,876
Put a lot of miles on that mattress, huh?

387
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,228
Later.

388
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,557
All right! Here's where we have
breakfast every morning.

389
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,557
Let's go up...

390
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,557
Oh-ho! Here they come!

391
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,795
- Charlie tried to kill my turtle!
- He didn't. It slipped out of his hands!

392
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,275
- He did!
- Hey, hey, guys! Whoa!

393
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,789
Whoa! Hey, look who's home!

394
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,595
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

395
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,792
Gee, Mom! We really missed you.

396
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,832
We're so glad you're back.

397
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,559
They're... They're not mine.

398
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,990
Oh, honey!
I was sure you'd remember them!

399
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,354
Well, I think I'd remember if I had three...

400
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,835
<i>Four,</i> honey! Don't forget little Joe.

401
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,795
Well, that's about it except for...

402
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,038
Hey, she's been in there an hour.
What did you guys get her?

403
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,116
- Dresses.
- The right sizes?

404
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,754
You didn't tell us.
You just said get some dresses.

405
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,155
OK, on the couch.
Come on, guys, don't blow it.

406
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,872
Hey, a dirty magazine!

407
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,556
Baby doll!

408
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,269
This garment cannot possibly
be a part of my wardrobe.

409
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,437
Let's forget for a moment that it's a rag,

410
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,915
but it happens to be 12 sizes too large.

411
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,510
- It's... It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

412
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,191
Well, come on, honey. You gotta
admit, you've lost a lot of weight.

413
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,515
Huh? You used to be like a balloon!

414
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,276
- Was I also shorter?
- Yes!

415
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,991
Yes, you had a bad back. You walked
kinda hunched over, you know?

416
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,036
I was short <i>and</i> fat?

417
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,794
Look, I'm sure you've got
a million questions.

418
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,708
You've been through hell. So, let's
just take this thing one step at a time.

419
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,637
First, let's meet the boys.

420
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,958
In the middle we've got the twins - Greg
and Charlie. He likes to invent things.

421
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,231
- Twins?
- Yeah. Obviously, they're not identical.

422
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,557
- Or I'd look like a shithead!
- Who asked you, butthole?!

423
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,919
They came out fighting
and they're still at it!

424
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,439
Guys, guys!

425
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,473
Charlie and I get along very well, Mom.
My twin brother and I are best friends.

426
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,238
He's the actor in the family.

427
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,796
Then we got the big guy!
11 pounds 5 ounces.

428
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,718
Come on, honey, give it a try.
What's his name?

429
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,873
Roy?

430
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,277
No. Travis. Sweet Trav?

431
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,436
- Now, those are tits!
- My turn!

432
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,551
Hey, what are you...?

433
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,352
I was hopin' you'd recall this guy.
He's your newest, honey.

434
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,835
Hi, Mom! My name's Joe.

435
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,756
- A falsetto child?
- Ah, he thinks he's Pee Wee Herman.

436
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,030
I love Pee Wee Herman. Ha ha!

437
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,355
- Give your ma a kiss.
- No! No! No!

438
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,196
Do they have a problem
with their glands?

439
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,915
Hey, hey, guys, easy! Come on!

440
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,190
It's not us, Dad, it's Roy!

441
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,029
Ah, they're great boys, aren't they?

442
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,957
There's so many of them.

443
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,117
You've always had
your heart set on six, so...

444
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,196
we'll just keep on tryin'.

445
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,995
Dad! They're making me drink blood!

446
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,518
- Come back here!
- No, no, no!

447
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,356
They don't look anything like me!

448
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,359
They do take after your mother. Let's
hope they don't grow up to be lushes, too.

449
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,116
- My mother's a lush?
- Was, honey.

450
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,629
- Cirrhosis.
- She's...?

451
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,958
- What about my father?
- Oh, he's alive and well.

452
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,868
- And due for parole in, what, two years?
- Oh, God! I don't wanna hear any more!

453
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,275
- Look...
- I just wanna remember for myself.

454
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,109
The doctor says the best thing for you
is to get back to your normal routine.

455
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,119
You gotta get your memory back that
way. You gotta do what you normally do.

456
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,469
What is it I normally do?

457
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,119
I prepared and handled raw food?

458
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,198
I hunt it. You cook it.

459
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,959
- You shot a chicken?
- Come on, honey!

460
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,116
Save the jokes! We're starvin' here.

461
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,593
Yeah!

462
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,915
It's strange, but... ooh!

463
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,594
I feel as if I've never done this
before in my life.

464
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,633
Dad, are you and Uncle Billy really
gonna open a miniature golf course?

465
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,194
Nah. We'll just build it
when someone pays for it.

466
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,676
- What's miniature golf?
- For midget brains, like you.

467
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,756
- I was only asking.
- You shut up!

468
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,794
You're gonna make that turtle sick again.

469
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,110
You gotta breathe on it.

470
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,036
Look at me, Dad!

471
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,355
Nothing's happening.

472
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,033
Well, pumpkin, you gotta light the burner.

473
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,035
30 seconds.

474
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,436
29... 28... 27...

475
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,396
Fire, fire!

476
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,192
Hey, come here. Sit down.

477
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,834
- Let me see your hand.
- I smell hair!

478
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,554
I'll get the burn ointment.
You'll be all right.

479
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,636
Ouch!

480
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,310
OK, let's see, we...

481
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,556
Way to hustle, guys!

482
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,636
You all right?

483
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,356
Well, now we know they work.

484
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,870
- Pretty good eats!
- Should mashed potatoes be crunchy?

485
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,239
Where are you going?

486
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,917
Out! I go out every night after dinner.

487
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,350
Meet the boys at the bowling alley
for a couple of beers.

488
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,314
- Don't leave me alone with them!
- Come on, honey. That's not fair.

489
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,512
You know we live like this.
Never bothered you before.

490
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,518
It's just the way it is.
You'd better get used to it.

491
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,590
When are you coming home?

492
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,675
When I feel like it.
It just depends on how drunk I get.

493
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,991
How's it goin' with your debutante?

494
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,271
She's one lousy cook!
But as long as I don't have to do it.

495
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,632
- How long are you gonna keep her?
- Let's see. 25 bucks a day, huh?

496
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,268
Figure little wifey-poo can work off what
she owes me in... a little over a month.

497
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,278
- Your first night with her, huh?
- Mm-hm.

498
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,674
Uh-huh! Come on, huh!

499
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,552
I'm not gonna tell you
she doesn't have a great body.

500
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,592
And a pretty decent face...
Ah, she's too rich for my blood!

501
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,349
Chocolate cake's a bit rich too,
but I'd like to eat one once in a while.

502
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,278
Not my style.
Course, eating a whole cake isn't, either.

503
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,630
But I'm gonna have some fun
with her tonight!

504
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,115
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you drinkin'?

505
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,310
Some rotgut. Cheapest stuff they got.

506
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,192
Perfect.

507
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,635
Wait!

508
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,991
You jumped my bones
the first night we met!

509
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,477
- We did it on the first date?
- Well, I couldn't call it a date, really.

510
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,797
We just did it right there
in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven.

511
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,237
- I'm a slut.
- Huh?

512
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,713
Nothing.

513
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,316
- Ooh!
- Oh!

514
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,877
Hey, I'm a little drunk tonight,
baby, so, you know,

515
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
it might take me a while to get there.

516
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,797
Oh! What? No boom-boom?

517
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,309
Well, hey, I understand.

518
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,558
You probably just wanna go right
to sleep and skip the fun stuff, huh?

519
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,193
- Yes.
- OK.

520
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,595
Thank you. No boom-boom.

521
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,031
- Baby.
- Hm?

522
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,038
- The couch.
- What?

523
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,278
You see, honey, you've got a bad back
because the bed's too soft for you.

524
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,472
That's why you always sleep
on the living-room couch.

525
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,468
I'm a short... fat... slut.

526
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,235
Get off of my body!

527
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,318
Rover!

528
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,077
- Up, up, up, up, up! Come on!
- Help! Help!

529
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,432
Time to get up. Gotta fix the kids' lunches
or they'll miss the bus for school.

530
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,199
I don't care if they don't go to school.

531
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,676
OK. They'll just be with you all day.

532
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,993
Bye, Mom!

533
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,590
Whoa, whoa, the bus is here!
7.15, let's go!

534
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,392
Hurry up, Mom!

535
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,791
Roy. Roy!

536
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,798
My name is Travis.

537
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,197
Travis.

538
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,911
Travisss!

539
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,068
Come on, Joey.

540
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,633
Stop honking!

541
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,957
Twin! Oh, twin!

542
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,674
She means you.
Have a good day at school, honey.

543
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,559
You ready? You ready?
Come on, come on!

544
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,875
Bye, Mom. You're doin' a great job.

545
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,355
I'm off to work.

546
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,313
Somebody's gotta keep this family
in the lap of luxury.

547
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,278
I figured you'd forget,
so I made it for you myself.

548
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,233
- What?
- Your list of daily chores.

549
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,316
See ya tonight.

550
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,149
- Dean?
- D Zippety doo dah!

551
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,599
D Zippety yay!

552
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,598
D My oh my, I got a wonderful slave

553
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,676
And you are a genius!

554
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,155
You're living in a nightmare
that starts at the crack of dawn.

555
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,590
Down! Down!

556
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,470
D <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

557
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,349
d <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

558
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,756
d <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

559
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,674
d <i>Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!</i>

560
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,037
D <i>Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!</i>

561
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,154
Dinner! Dinner!

562
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,791
She needs food.

563
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,876
This is fun.

564
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,869
Hey, guys.

565
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,752
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothing. We're OK. We're fine.

566
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,713
- How about you?
- Oh, no. What's wrong with her?

567
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,395
She's been like that for an hour now.

568
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,556
- She's getting better, though.
- Better?

569
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,636
Yeah, she's not going "Ba-ba-ba..."

570
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,832
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

571
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,520
- Why did she do that?
- She destroyed the scarecrow.

572
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,392
She ripped the sucker's head off!

573
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,197
I like when she goes
"Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba."

574
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,958
Hey! Baby doll!

575
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,675
What's for dinner?

576
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,918
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu ba-ba-ha-ha...

577
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,918
OK! I'll take it from here.
Go on, get upstairs!

578
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,437
- Will you trade her in for a new one?
- Nah, she'll be all right.

579
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,916
Come on, guys! Move it!

580
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,916
Feel better?

581
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,989
I don't belong here. I feel it.
Don't you think I feel it?

582
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,394
I can't do any of these vile things
and I wouldn't want to!

583
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,116
My life is like death!

584
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,199
My children are the spawn of hell
and you're the devil.

585
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,276
Oh, God...

586
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,473
Baby, we <i>like</i> you.

587
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,954
She's OK. She's doin' the dishes.

588
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,197
- No more "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba".
- Good. All right.

589
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,435
- Dad?
- Yeah?

590
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,109
- Will she figure out we're tricking her?
- Not if we don't blow it.

591
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,438
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for memorabilia.

592
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,156
Memora-what?

593
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,916
Scrapbooks. Photographs.

594
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,116
Something that will spark
some wisp of a memory.

595
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,595
Do we or do we not possess these things?

596
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,598
Uh, well...

597
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,871
Do you mean to tell me
there is no photographic evidence

598
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,675
of our life together...
anywhere in existence?

599
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,031
Well, I don't know
where they'd be because, uh...

600
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,720
you know,
we lost a lot of stuff in the move.

601
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,434
And it's possible that, uh...

602
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,835
we lost...

603
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,876
The closet

604
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,952
and you.

605
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,079
That's right. This is me...
and I'm standing in front of the closet.

606
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,951
Something's familiar.

607
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,628
You got it. We used to do it in the closet.

608
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,591
Oh, stop with the sex stories!

609
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,075
You're grumpy
because you've been busy.

610
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,556
I want you to stop everything,
go on in here, take a bath...

611
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,240
Hey, guys!
Get the turtle out of the bathtub!

612
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,238
I'll look for the pictures
first thing in the morning, OK?

613
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,316
All right. Good night, honey.

614
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,514
- Somebody better be dead!
- Billy!

615
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,517
Billy, I want you to do me a favour.

616
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,676
- Who you talkin' to?
- Nobody.

617
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,074
- Who's that?
- No one.

618
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,599
Hey, is that Dean?

619
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,314
- Hi, Dean. Come on in.
- Go back to bed, Gertie.

620
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,592
- If you treat me like that, I'm goin' home.
- Come on, Gertie, don't be like that!

621
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,792
Remember in high school you faked
our IDs? I need a fake bride.

622
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,469
- Come on, Dean. I'm busy!
- Not any more. She's goin' home.

623
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,111
OK, but if we get caught, it's your ass!

624
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,919
It's my wedding day.
Why do I look so annoyed?

625
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,315
Oh, yeah. Your dad showed up shit-faced.

626
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,591
He threw potato salad all over my mom.
We had to throw him out!

627
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,393
Why do I always have
this depressed look on my face?

628
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,195
You were grumpy a lot. You were losing
the weight, then you gained it back.

629
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,835
- Thin, fat, thin, fat.
- Was I <i>always</i> this miserable?

630
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,952
- Wasn't I ever happy?
- Well, sure, honey. Lots.

631
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,753
You were the happiest
little wife and mother around!

632
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,555
Look at this. Before you lost the weight.
Can you believe it?

633
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,359
All right. Now, that's it. Are you satisfied?

634
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,276
- Yes.
- Good.

635
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,353
I suppose I belong here in this... hovel.

636
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,836
Come on, Jackson!

637
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,676
Well, this is my life.

638
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,236
I didn't marry very well, did I?

639
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,276
D <i>Your body</i>

640
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,109
I love LA. I love all my starlets!

641
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,674
- What were your names again?
- Tofutti Klein.

642
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,677
Tofutti! I love it!

643
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,950
If that's my mother-in-law,
I'm not here.

644
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,275
You're Kim and Kimberly...

645
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,639
- The Stayton yacht.
- <i>Hello, Andrew. It's Mrs Mintz</i>.

646
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,671
I'm so virile, I'm so rich!

647
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,791
<i>I'd like to speak to my daughter</i>.

648
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,354
<i>They're not here, madam</i>.
<i>They've gone shopping</i>.

649
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,074
Uh, a little bit lower.

650
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,668
Yeah. Yeah, lower.

651
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,316
That's good. That's good.

652
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,759
- Were you really in the Coast Guard?
- Damn right.

653
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,871
Why does he keep staring at me?

654
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,752
- Is he?
- Yes! He was staring at me

655
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,996
with his mouth open all through dinner.

656
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,874
Well, honey,
Billy was your high-school boyfriend.

657
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,149
You don't get any of the old feelings back
when you look at him, do you?

658
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,757
I don't wanna do it!

659
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,634
You gotta do it
if you wanna be a gruesome ghoul!

660
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,433
It's part of the initiation! Think about it.

661
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,518
That's good. Thanks a lot. Ah, yeah.

662
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,191
Uh, sugarlips.
I think our guest needs another beer.

663
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,957
Uh, well, I really shouldn't,
but maybe, uh... just one more

664
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,713
six-pack!

665
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,117
- Attagirl!
- Thank you.

666
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,798
That's all the beer.

667
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,309
Whoa, buttercup!
Just about time for dessert!

668
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,908
- How about some brownies?
- I didn't make any.

669
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,838
- How about chocolate cream pie?
- I made that.

670
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,589
- Is this gonna work?
- My ideas always work. I'm gifted.

671
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,871
I loved it when you glued Joey
to the toilet seat.

672
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,795
I was thinking about it at work.
We need a theme for the golf course.

673
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,477
We can use a few contraptions
you can knock some golf balls through.

674
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,797
- What's the score? I had my eyes closed.
- 32-10.

675
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,229
- Who's winning?
- The guys with 32.

676
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,197
- Great!
- Who did this?!

677
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,352
Travis!

678
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,675
Hey, honey, what happened?

679
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,758
Oooh! <i>This</i> happened.

680
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,954
- You guys are beggin' for it!
- Stop blustering! You won't punish them!

681
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,594
Ease up there, love chop! Just ease up.

682
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,109
Ease up? Ease up?

683
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,077
Since I walked through that door,
I have cooked, cleaned,

684
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,997
scrubbed, chopped wood.

685
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,795
I've waited on you, your dogs,
your kids and your friends

686
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,117
in the hopes that I would
remember some shred of my life

687
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,516
and now it is entirely clear to me
why I've chosen to block it out!

688
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,393
- Now, none of this ever...
- Bothered me before.

689
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,112
Well, it bothers me now.

690
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,080
- All right, Joe!
- Is that so?

691
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,834
Hey, hey, Joe! Come on, guys!
No more jokes on Mom today, huh?

692
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,996
You really got her where you want her.

693
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,918
I got everything under control,
don't worry.

694
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,032
- This is flat. Give me another one, Billy.
- I only got six.

695
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,709
We're just gonna have to send out
the old ball and chain to buy some more.

696
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,637
Good stuff!

697
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,716
Your chocolate cream pie.

698
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,198
Thanks, honey.

699
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,233
I guess it's kinda tough to serve
with your hands stuck to plates.

700
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,512
Honey, we need forks!

701
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,836
- Sugarlips!
- Yeah?

702
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,672
Wait a minute!

703
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,716
Fire, fire, fire!

704
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,909
- Yeah!
- OK, guys, go get her!

705
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,996
Hey, thanks for a lovely dinner.

706
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,032
- She never did that before.
- She did it now!

707
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,913
- Look at this! I gotta go to work!
- Wait for me!

708
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,630
She went this way, guys!

709
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,115
Gruesome ghouls, attack!

710
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,834
- What should I do, Travis?
- Go home!

711
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,193
I got you!

712
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,918
- Tickle her!
- She's ticklish!

713
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,476
Ow, that hurts! Ow!

714
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,151
Leave me alone!

715
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,796
All right, time to get up.

716
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,713
Go to the bathroom
and do what you normally do.

717
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,673
- You gonna squirt us with a hose again?
- That's up to you.

718
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,759
- I gotta feed my turtle.
- The damn turtle stole my headband.

719
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,836
Joey, come on. Time to get up!

720
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,589
I don't want to! The teacher's a big fat tub!

721
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,276
Proffitt boys, come up here!

722
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,918
Miss Pitcannon tells me
you don't wanna take these tests.

723
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,429
I'm itchin' and I wanna go home!

724
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,553
You may go stand in the corner
until you can talk like a little boy!

725
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,399
All of you children
are new in this school.

726
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,956
These scores will determine
your placement in future classes.

727
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,868
- You must concentrate... Greg! Stop that!
- Make a face.

728
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,036
- I'm in real bad shape!
- Nonsense!

729
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,517
Now, if you concentrate, I'm sure
you can control those little bodies.

730
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,351
I see that, Amanda.

731
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,436
Joey, sit!

732
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,836
- Is anyone at your home?
- Yeah. Our mom is.

733
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,191
You have a mother now?
Your father remarried?

734
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,118
Um, yeah. We got a new mother now.

735
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,676
Well, good.
Then I'm calling <i>both</i> your parents!

736
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,430
Mrs Burbridge, I'm Annie Proffitt.
What happened?

737
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,872
Well, Mrs Proffitt, apparently
your children consider themselves

738
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,594
above taking
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests.

739
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,473
I'm sorry. What are
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests?

740
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,799
Placement tests. They are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential.

741
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,114
Sit still!

742
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,038
Your children are a discipline problem.

743
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,391
I know. I have had difficulties myself.

744
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,117
- What did you do now?
- Oh! They decided to play sick!

745
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,595
And not very convincingly.

746
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,350
Now, I believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance.

747
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,074
The children are slovenly, incorrigible

748
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,796
and being reared by a father who clearly
isn't concerned about their welfare,

749
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,753
but is himself just a large child!

750
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,555
- Excuse me, Mrs Burbridge.
- Oh, the test results. Thank you.

751
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,355
I'll look these over as soon as
I'm finished with this... <i>woman</i>.

752
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,391
Oh, my God.

753
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,473
I'll see you later in the cafeteria.

754
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,631
Mrs Burbridge,
would you come over here for a moment?

755
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,078
Has it escaped your attention that these
children have head-to-toe poison oak?

756
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,555
Well, no... Yes, but...

757
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,275
But what? My children are
in need of medical assistance!

758
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,279
And you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests?

759
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,757
Tests which label children's potential -
a thing which <i>cannot</i> be measured!

760
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,678
Least of all by anal-compulsive Huns!

761
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,312
And my husband may be a large child,
but that's none of your business.

762
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,908
And my children may be rotten,
but they're mine!

763
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,508
And I think that they're bright
and sensitive.

764
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,712
So I have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence!

765
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,798
I do, however,
have serious doubts about yours!

766
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,951
Kids, get in the car. Let's go.

767
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,275
Move!

768
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,799
- She told her off.
- Dad never did that.

769
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,072
Discipline problem?

770
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,479
My regards to
Schwartzman and Heinliken.

771
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,268
I can't stop itching!

772
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,359
Well, what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak?

773
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,952
What I want you to do, what the doctor
said, is put it right on the red parts.

774
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,149
OK?

775
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,750
Soon we're going to clean up
this room because it's a disgrace.
