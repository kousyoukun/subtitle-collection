1
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,959
Dock five, the <i>Immaculata?</i>

2
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,618
It's over there!

3
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:04,855
Oh!

4
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,667
I cannot, I repeat, cannot

5
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,796
sit in this cesspool by the sea
with nothing to do.

6
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,463
So, while you repair your silly boat
engines, I will do some remodeling.

7
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:28,730
- I've sent for a carpenter.
- Whatever, diddums. I'm shooting skeet.

8
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:32,013
Hello!

9
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:37,602
Mr Stayton? Anybody home?

10
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,855
- Hello!
- State your purpose!

11
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,359
- Nice-looking Wetherby you got.
- It's a very expensive gun.

12
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:47,695
- I have lots and lots of them.
- Somebody call for a carpenter?

13
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:49,489
That's my wife's department.

14
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:52,200
Could you tell me
where your wife might... be?

15
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:01,084
You're the carpenter?

16
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,879
Yeah. Dean Proffitt.

17
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:07,048
You're late.

18
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,677
- References?
- Well, no, not really.

19
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,179
You see, I just moved up to this area...

20
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:16,850
Hey, I've been doing this kind
of shit - work - for years.

21
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,853
This is... This is just beautiful. Wow!

22
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,898
- Try not to touch anything.
- Oh, I won't.

23
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,193
Andrew will keep an eye on you.

24
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:31,448
Maybe you'd like to take fingerprints
before I get started.

25
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,616
I was just... kidding.

26
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:39,747
Don't walk so close to me!

27
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:41,708
OK! Where's your problem?

28
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,626
- My closet.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,754
In here.

30
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,467
Now, you can see
how inadequate this all is.

31
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:53,344
I need new shoe racks for my shoes.

32
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,056
Uh, excuse me. I was told that
this was some kind of an emergency.

33
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,476
It is.

34
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,770
And I need drawers for my lingerie.

35
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:05,982
I can't keep entering
these boxes all the time.

36
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:10,737
Hello?

37
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:16,659
Uh... Hey, I'm sorry. I understand now.
You want me to remodel your closet.

38
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:22,290
Isn't that what I've been explaining
in some detail?

39
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,542
Is English your second language?

40
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,713
What is that odor?

41
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,009
I don't smell anything.

42
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:35,261
Madam.

43
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:39,140
Well! I almost had to wait.

44
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:45,021
I got an idea for a shoe rack
right in here maybe, huh?

45
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,069
What <i>is</i> this gelatinous muck?!

46
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:54,948
Andrew, when I tell you to pack staples,

47
00:05:55,073 --> 00:06:00,703
must I specify that you are to pack
good caviar and not this $1.99 fish bait!

48
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,541
- Yes, madam.
- Caviar should be round and hard

49
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,918
and of adequate size.

50
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:11,464
And it should burst in your mouth
at <i>precisely</i> the right moment.

51
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:14,843
Yes, madam.

52
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:16,845
- Carpenter!
- Yeah?

53
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,348
You have exactly 48 hours.
I suggest you get started.

54
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,145
- Throw that out.
- Yes, madam.

55
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,274
Watch him.

56
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:36,281
<i>Mais oui! Bien sur!</i>

57
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:38,616
<i>Oui?</i>

58
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:41,202
<i>Ecoutez, Jean-Jacques.
Je vous telephone...</i>

59
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:44,122
Oh, boy. She is really something!

60
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,292
I know it will cost me,
but it's the cutest little painting.

61
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:50,545
I simply must have it.
You'll do the bidding for me?

62
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,255
But of course!

63
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,425
- Bid 1,700,000.
- Shit!

64
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:59,012
Grant, I'm on the phone!

65
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:02,307
I can't hear you, tea rose!
I'm shooting skeet!

66
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,058
- Pull!
- Pull!

67
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,852
Firing!

68
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:21,993
Hello.

69
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:47,727
Forks were invented so man
could at least make a pretense

70
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:51,773
- of separating himself from the apes.
- So were thumbs.

71
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:57,195
- What did you say?
- Nothin'. Just... my stomach.

72
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:01,449
Well, try to control your bodily noises
so I can hear myself think!

73
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,791
<i>And another
Oregon good morning to you.</i>

74
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,293
<i>Wilbur Budd here with some local items</i>.

75
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,923
<i>The Fraga Feed and Fertilizer folks
are hiring people to shovel the stuff.</i>

76
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:21,678
<i>Oh, women are welcome, too. There's
no chauvinism in the manure business.</i>

77
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:25,598
These gnats keep landing
on my wet nail polish.

78
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:29,894
I guess I'm supposed to walk around with
their little corpses stuck to my fingers.

79
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,313
- Joanna, please!
- It's easy for you to say!

80
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:36,484
You don't have to sit out here in the brine
with your perm frizzing to oblivion.

81
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,570
I look like a bushman.

82
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:41,906
Why don't you go inside
and get out of the sea air?

83
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:46,453
Because that Elk Snout mountain man
is still working on my closet.

84
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:48,621
He's sweating all over the place.

85
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:50,790
I doubt if he's even housebroken.

86
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:53,960
- Oh, I think they housebreak each other...
- Ssh!

87
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:56,546
- What?
- He's listening.

88
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,757
- Who?
- That carpenter.

89
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:02,093
He's been hanging on our every word
for the last two days.

90
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:05,180
It's your project, Joanna.
You deal with it.

91
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,684
- Come along, men.
- The engines are ready, sir.

92
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:11,853
Well, let's get going.

93
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,523
I've finished, madam.
Shall I put your jewellery back on you?

94
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:16,733
No.

95
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,444
I'm still tacky.

96
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:36,961
Keep quiet for ten more minutes, collect
the money and get the hell outta here.

97
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,380
Well! Are we amusing you?

98
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:44,052
- What... is this?
- Uh, well, I'm done. I'm finished.

99
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:46,554
- Uh... What do you think?
- What is it?

100
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,933
Well, it's a shoe rack... with a twist.
Uh... You ready?

101
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:55,021
Just turn the crank here, those drop back,
these split. Gives you twice the space...

102
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:58,191
Stop boring me with your absurdities.
What's it made of?

103
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,360
It's called wood. It's oak.

104
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:02,862
Oak. An oak closet?

105
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,948
Huh! Why am I even amazed?

106
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:07,367
I don't know. Why are you amazed?

107
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:12,497
One would think you would know closets
are made of cedar. If not, we get moths.

108
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:16,501
Well, lady, there's not a real big
moth problem off the Pacific coast.

109
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:20,046
But if you want one out of cedar,
that's fine. I'll start all over.

110
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:23,925
I just have to tell ya that's gonna
more than double my estimate.

111
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,847
- What do you mean?
- I've already done this out of oak, so...

112
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:33,184
- I'm not paying for your mistake!
- I'm not just gonna eat it on this deal.

113
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:35,603
Why not?
You've eaten everything else here.

114
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,897
And you will eat it
because I wanted cedar!

115
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,775
You may have <i>wanted</i> cedar,
but you didn't <i>ask</i> for it.

116
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,862
The entire civilized world
knows closets are made of cedar!

117
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:47,282
In Elk Snout,
we don't know about them closets!

118
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:51,578
Nor bathrooms, neither! Shit, woman!
You're lucky I <i>am</i> housebroke!

119
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:55,582
- You were listening.
- Well, it was kinda hard to avoid.

120
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:59,169
- You can avoid it now - you're fired!
- You're unbelievable!

121
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:03,006
That's fine with me!
Just pay me the money you owe me.

122
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,969
- The job was not done to my satisfaction!
- I got news for you, lady!

123
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:10,597
No job will ever be done
to your satisfaction!

124
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:12,766
That's quite enough! Now, just get out!

125
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,685
No problem! Pay me the <i>6</i> 00 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone!

126
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,854
Captain Karl! Start up the engine!

127
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,859
You know what your problem is? Huh?

128
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:26,362
You're so goddamn bored,
you gotta invent things to bitch about.

129
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,532
You haven't got a single thing to do
except for your hair.

130
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:31,493
Yeah! The closet was fine!

131
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:34,788
You just needed somethin'
to take up your useless, empty,

132
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:39,334
nail-polishing, toe-polishing,
rich-bitch, sun tanning days!

133
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,715
- Don't touch me!
- What?

134
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:48,927
Hey, lady.

135
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:54,140
I may be hard up, but I am not that
hard up. And I'm not goin' anywhere...

136
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:56,851
Hey!

137
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:00,605
- Damn you!
- Man overboard!

138
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,774
I'll get you for this, you...

139
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,486
Not my tool belt! You owe me <i>6</i> 00 bucks!

140
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,739
- Keep going!
- As you wish.

141
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:14,702
If I ever get you, lady, you're dead meat!
You got that?

142
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,871
No, don't throw that!

143
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,876
I'm not bored! I'm quite happy!

144
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,045
Everyone wants to be me!

145
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:27,590
You come back here!

146
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,802
I lost all my tools.

147
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:34,055
I'll loan you some tools.
We'll get you some part-time work.

148
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,100
I need a steady job.
What about that night-time thing?

149
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:41,521
I'm working on it. Listen, pretty soon,
we'll get that miniature golf course deal.

150
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:43,690
If I can hang on that long.

151
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:49,028
He called you a what?

152
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:53,450
Joanna, why are you so upset?

153
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:58,580
Why in the world do you care what some
carpenter from Elk Snout thinks of you?

154
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,166
I'm sure I'm just premenstrual.

155
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,420
Then you must go right back to bed
for at least two days.

156
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:09,674
Inga, you don't shove the food
down Shiitake's throat.

157
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,928
You place it on her tongue.
Don't they have dogs in Sweden?

158
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:16,431
Grant mentioned having a baby again.

159
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,434
<i>What should I do?</i>

160
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,062
<i>Darling, if you have a baby,</i>

161
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,231
you won't be the baby any more.

162
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:27,358
True.

163
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:30,528
<i>Well, I must go. Bye-bye, Mommy</i>.

164
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:32,322
Bye-bye, sweetie.

165
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:35,241
I'm not a bitch.

166
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,874
Andrew!
Are you going to bring me my lemon

167
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,794
or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

168
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,343
Hey, guys, I'm home!

169
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:58,807
Stay away, you wolves! No! Shoo!

170
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:00,975
Bad dogs! Go away!

171
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,270
Buster! Jackson! Get back inside!

172
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:07,899
- Are you Mr Proffitt?
- Yeah!

173
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:11,778
You look like the morning after
Halloween. Probably had a day like I did.

174
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:15,323
- What happened to you?
- Monday is their first day of school

175
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:19,911
and I came here to welcome your family.
And what do I get in return?

176
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:23,790
- I get toilet-papered by your children!
- They're just playin' around!

177
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:28,461
Just playin' around? They were about
to douse the toilet paper with gasoline

178
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:30,630
- and strike...
- Wait, wait! Stop.

179
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,007
- Greg and Charlie. Twins, right?
- Yeah.

180
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:37,429
They're having this arson period. They
don't know this, but I'm ahead of them.

181
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:39,889
I got two fire extinguishers ready to go.

182
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,475
- I didn't catch your name.
- Adele Burbridge.

183
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,894
- Nice to meet you.
- Principal of the Elk Cove school.

184
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,023
- Your children are monsters!
- You won't think that once you know 'em!

185
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,945
- Where is Mrs Proffitt during all of this?
- She died three years ago.

186
00:14:56,072 --> 00:15:01,327
Mr Proffitt, your children are totally
lacking in parental supervision.

187
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,664
Hey, you don't have to tell <i>me</i>
these kids are lucky.

188
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:08,293
Fine. You can joke all you want,
but I am serious about this.

189
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:13,339
If you don't do something, I am going
to notify the proper authorities.

190
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,801
I have had baby-sitters in here
by the dozen, but...

191
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,970
I'm... I'm kinda low on cash right now.

192
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:23,308
I'm new in town, but if I get a chance
I'll hire a housekeeper, all right?

193
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:26,436
I'll believe it when I see it.
Good day, Mr Proffitt!

194
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,315
I'm a good father!

195
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,735
Ah, what do you know?

196
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:50,043
Joanna, I want you tonight.

197
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:52,962
How can you have your period
every week?!

198
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:58,093
<i>You can stow away with the rich
and famous to exotic ports of call...</i>

199
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,678
Must you watch that thing incessantly?

200
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:05,475
Yes, I must. It has a tawdry escapist
quality that soothes my nerves.

201
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,145
What you have to escape from,
I can't possibly imagine.

202
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:13,233
Grant! I left my wedding ring on the deck.

203
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:16,861
- Well, what can <i>I</i> do?
- Go and get it.

204
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,011
It's after midnight!

205
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:20,597
I don't care what time it is.
I want it now!

206
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,952
I want to see who's in the top ten yachts.

207
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,621
- I'll get it!
- OK.

208
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:31,292
<i>A countdown to the world's
ten best luxury yachts.</i>

209
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:34,462
<i>This is the big league of the seven seas</i>.

210
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:39,592
<i>The one purchase that separates
mere millionaires from multimillionaires.</i>

211
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:42,512
<i>Our number ten pick
is the Loca Rohan,</i>

212
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:47,183
<i>a 167-foot Saudi-owned dreamboat,
docked in Tahiti.</i>

213
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:49,352
<i>Number nine, the 230</i>...

214
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,538
Andrew!

215
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,378
Grant!

216
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,802
Oh, my hair!

217
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,304
Help!

218
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:29,559
Grant! Help!

219
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:34,355
Stop! You idiots!

220
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:41,654
Another Oregon good morning to you!
This is Wilbur Budd here at KRAB,

221
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,658
the family station,
run by me and my family.

222
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:49,829
Sorry to interrupt the movie, but we got
some excitement in Tillamook County.

223
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:53,750
I've got a bulletin for the eyewitness,
on-the-spot KRAB newsroom.

224
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,086
It seems a mystery woman
was picked up

225
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:59,380
by the Elk Cove garbage scow
shortly after midnight.

226
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:02,383
They fished her out of the water
and she's conscious,

227
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,637
but the problem is she seems
to be suffering from amnesia.

228
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:08,264
She has no recollection of who she is.

229
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:11,309
<i>My wife Rose is with
the captain of the garbage scow</i>

230
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:13,353
<i>that picked up the mystery lady</i>.

231
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:15,396
- <i>Rose?</i>
- Mr Tunatti.

232
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:19,651
Can you tell us what the woman was like
when you brought her aboard?

233
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:24,364
Yes. We saw something float in water
like this. Just like that, just like that.

234
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:27,784
We didn't know it... We bring... on board.

235
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,662
- On board.
- Yes. We say... <i>foca!</i>

236
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:33,081
Excuse me,
you can't say that on television!

237
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,041
No, no, no, no!

238
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,836
<i>Foca! Foca!</i>
<i>Foca</i> means seal in <i>Portuguese!</i>

239
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,213
- Oh, I see!
- Seal, seal! So we bring...

240
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:43,758
- You learn something every day!
- No clothes. Just a little thing.

241
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:48,263
<i>- There you have it. Thank you, Tunatti.
- Thank you.</i>

242
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,432
<i>Garbage I do for money. For love, I sing</i>.

243
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:53,059
<i>- In my country, I sing.
- Isn't that interesting?</i>

244
00:18:55,186 --> 00:19:00,150
<i>- We have a Renaissance garbageman.
- We tell stories with our songs.</i>

245
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,110
<i>Thank you, Rose</i>.

246
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,447
<i>Arnie, can we roll that tape now, please?</i>

247
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,201
<i>Now, folks. Here's an interview
we taped earlier at the hospital.</i>

248
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,246
<i>Miss, miss</i>... <i>do you know your name?</i>

249
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,415
<i>Of course I know my name!</i>

250
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:18,042
<i>It's</i>...

251
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,211
<i>Oh! This is absurd!</i>

252
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,964
<i>I know it! It</i>...

253
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,592
<i>Get that thing out of my face!</i>

254
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,928
<i>What a horrible wig!</i>

255
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:43,651
You mean to tell me
that I have no medical recourse?

256
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:47,030
- Can she see us?
- Not unless she's Superwoman.

257
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:52,243
Well, what do you know? Extend your
brain a teensy little bit, if possible!

258
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:55,914
You seem to be suffering
from a temporary amnesia,

259
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,251
either from the bump into the garbage
scow or the shock of the cold water.

260
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,962
- How temporary is it?
- Well, we don't know.

261
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:06,174
Otherwise, you seem to be
in excellent physical shape.

262
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,343
Listen to me, medical people.

263
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:12,764
As of now, I have a life history
of a dirty garbage scow

264
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,392
and a breakfast of
extremely runny eggs over easy!

265
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:19,813
Now I refuse... refuse...

266
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:24,067
to be incarcerated in this
semi-private room!

267
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,069
You snore!

268
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,780
No efforts are being made
for anyone to locate...

269
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:29,948
Is that her?

270
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:34,077
<i>I demand you do something!
Do you hear me?</i>

271
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:36,663
No! I never saw her before in my life.

272
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:42,377
Mrs Stayton has decided
to leave me. Let's celebrate!

273
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:48,758
Now, Miss, uh... X, we have
a comfortable private room for you

274
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:53,680
where you'll be safer, we'll all be safer,
and you'll be a lot more comfortable.

275
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:57,267
Well, I'm glad you've <i>finally</i>
come to your senses!

276
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,394
I was prepared to sue you.

277
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,605
I don't know who I am,
but I'm sure I have a lawyer.

278
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:16,202
- Hey, you about done?
- Yeah! I think I got it fixed.

279
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:19,330
- Your lunch is on the counter.
- Thanks.

280
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,833
<i>Hi, this is Wilbur Budd.
We got some more</i>

281
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,211
<i>on that amnesia lady story
down there in Elk Grove.</i>

282
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:27,380
<i>Wanna push in on these, Barry, please?</i>

283
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:31,009
Uh, I saw some potato chips
around the corner. Could I just...?

284
00:21:31,134 --> 00:21:33,178
OK, one bag!

285
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:38,516
<i>I said Elk Grove before. You know
I meant Elk Cove. Anything new, honey?</i>

286
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:42,604
<i>The mystery woman is still suffering
from complete but temporary amnesia.</i>

287
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:47,400
<i>If you know the identity of this
woman, please contact Elk Cove Hospital.</i>

288
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:50,653
<i>I'll put up the reward myself.
She's drivin' us crazy.</i>

289
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,906
- <i>Thank you. Back to Wilbur</i>...
- Yo, Dean!

290
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:58,995
- <i>She's not the nicest person around</i>...
- Look at this!

291
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,749
<i>She made some remarks about
Rose's hair, which I didn't care for.</i>

292
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:05,919
<i>In any event, there she is
and this is what she looks like.</i>

293
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:07,629
- That's her.
- Who?

294
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,589
The bitch!

295
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:14,511
<i>Earlier today, one man arrived on
the scene to make an identification, but...</i>

296
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:17,680
I can't believe it.
He's skippin' out on her.

297
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:20,558
Course he is! It's his shot at freedom.

298
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,228
We should go and see
if we can get your money back.

299
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:25,396
- Look, he's gone!
- Not him, her!

300
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:31,361
She doesn't know who she is. Do you
think she's gonna know who I am?

301
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:40,620
- Billy, there is a God and he loves me.
- You're not gonna shave your head?

302
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,038
No.

303
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:44,707
- Dean...
- I gotta go talk to my kids.

304
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,502
I want you to take 'em shopping
at the Salvation Army.

305
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,879
This is illegal! Dean, you're crazy!

306
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,969
I wondered if a woman like that
had a husband.

307
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:59,764
- Oh, yeah! She does!
- Here's some effects you may recognise.

308
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:00,974
Oh, yeah.

309
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:04,811
Nice panties. Some initials here,
she didn't know what they meant. JS.

310
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:08,690
She wouldn't cos, see,
I bought these for her at a garage sale.

311
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:12,026
- I bought my wife a garter at a yard sale.
- I bet you did.

312
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:15,155
- Hey, what else you got in here?
- I got some pictures.

313
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,740
We were gonna wire them,
but now you're here...

314
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:20,118
Yeah! That's her.

315
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:24,164
Oh, yeah. That's my little cookie-cutter.

316
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:26,624
- Quite a beauty!
- She's somethin', isn't she?

317
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,127
You got that right!

318
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,212
Doc. We got a winner.

319
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:52,942
Annie!

320
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,154
Stop!

321
00:23:57,363 --> 00:23:59,324
I don't recognise this man.

322
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,118
Your wife's had an almost
total loss of memory.

323
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,997
I-I can't believe
she doesn't know her own husband!

324
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,460
This missing-link person
is not my husband!

325
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:12,962
Oh, Annie, please!

326
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,174
- Annie. Annie.
- Right.

327
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,259
That's not right. That's not my name!

328
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:21,679
This is completely crazy! Honey, sit down.

329
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:26,184
Everything's gonna be OK.
Now... I <i>am</i> your husband.

330
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:28,353
My name is Dean Proffitt.

331
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,689
We've been married for 13 years.

332
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:33,441
Wait!

333
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:37,070
I admit I have forgotten numerous things.

334
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:41,032
But I truly, from the depths of my soul,
do not remember you!

335
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:44,035
Don't you think
there'd be some spark of recognition?

336
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,455
- We don't know.
- Maybe you'll spark to this!

337
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:57,674
Ugh! I don't believe this!
He could be some stranger off the street!

338
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,176
Well, he seems to like you
and he's a nice guy.

339
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,886
- He's good-lookin'.
- Clean.

340
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,722
- What's my full name?
- Oh, come on!

341
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:07,308
- What is it?
- Mrs Annie Proffitt!

342
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:11,146
- What's my maiden name?
- Annie... Goolihy.

343
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:14,190
Annie Goolihy?

344
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,651
Where in God's name did I grow up?
Dogpatch?

345
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:21,906
No, no, not there! Over in Goober, Idaho.
But it's a nuclear waste dump now...

346
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,534
- Where did I meet you?
- Hank's Donut World.

347
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,163
Seattle? You hung out there every night
when you were in the Navy!

348
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,623
- You remember...
- I was in the armed forces?

349
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:33,209
I've still got your postcards
from Okinawa...

350
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:36,004
Stop. The Navy?

351
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:37,630
Oh, come on, honey!

352
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,924
You gotta know! You were in the Navy!

353
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:43,887
No, I don't know! I don't know
any of this and I don't know you!

354
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:47,056
I need some proof!

355
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:49,976
Stop staring at me!

356
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,729
Eat your checkers!

357
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:58,109
Look, if it were up to us, we'd be glad
to give her to you, but she's right.

358
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:00,236
I'm gonna need some verification.

359
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:03,782
Oh, listen... I know what you mean.
I understand. Now...

360
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:08,870
I don't like to talk about this in public,
and I've never told anybody...

361
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:14,417
She does have a small
strawberry-like birthmark, uh...

362
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,920
It's kinda high up on her... left cheek

363
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,923
and it's unique.

364
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,694
Come to Daddy!

365
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,046
Mister!
What was I doing out in the ocean?

366
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:06,428
Um... That's something you like to do.
You know, divin' for oysters at night.

367
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:09,973
Sometimes you get pretty far
from the shore and that undertow...

368
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:14,394
Oysters? In a cold ocean at night?
That doesn't sound like me.

369
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:21,985
I just... ate a bug!

370
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:29,492
Keep your mouth closed!
A lot of things flying around out here.

371
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:52,307
Welcome home, baby!

372
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:55,101
I feel faint.

373
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:00,440
Come on, Buster! Come on, Jackson!

374
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:03,818
No. This is wrong.

375
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:07,030
Come along, now.
We've only been here a couple of weeks.

376
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:12,410
A lot of stuff's in boxes from the move,
so I hardly recognise the place myself.

377
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:15,622
We moved here... deliberately?

378
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:21,586
Our last place was a real dump.

379
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:25,548
Come on.

380
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:31,054
Our new palace!

381
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:40,146
Well!

382
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:44,275
Let me, uh... Let me show you around.
Maybe something'll come back to you.

383
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:49,447
- Did I just go downhill?
- Look at that. It's comin' back already.

384
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:52,283
Everything slants down here
toward the bedroom.

385
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:56,121
Dining room and toilet... Only one.

386
00:28:57,247 --> 00:29:01,167
And here we are at the old,
uh... magic room.

387
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:04,295
Put a lot of miles on that mattress, huh?

388
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:06,756
Later.

389
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:10,218
All right! Here's where we have
breakfast every morning.

390
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:12,303
Let's go up...

391
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:14,389
Oh-ho! Here they come!

392
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:21,938
- Charlie tried to kill my turtle!
- He didn't. It slipped out of his hands!

393
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:24,524
- He did!
- Hey, hey, guys! Whoa!

394
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:27,152
Whoa! Hey, look who's home!

395
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:30,071
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

396
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:33,408
Gee, Mom! We really missed you.

397
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:36,578
We're so glad you're back.

398
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:40,457
They're... They're not mine.

399
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:44,043
Oh, honey!
I was sure you'd remember them!

400
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,547
Well, I think I'd
remember if I had three...

401
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:50,133
<i>Four,</i> honey! Don't forget little Joe.

402
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:56,347
Well, that's about it except for...

403
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:04,939
Hey, she's been in there an hour.
What did you guys get her?

404
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:07,108
- Dresses.
- The right sizes?

405
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:09,861
You didn't tell us.
You just said get some dresses.

406
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:12,363
OK, on the couch.
Come on, guys, don't blow it.

407
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,157
Hey, a dirty magazine!

408
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:16,951
Baby doll!

409
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:21,873
This garment cannot possibly
be a part of my wardrobe.

410
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:25,168
Let's forget for a moment that it's a rag,

411
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:27,754
but it happens to be 12 sizes too large.

412
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:31,508
- It's... It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

413
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:36,387
Well, come on, honey. You gotta
admit, you've lost a lot of weight.

414
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:38,807
Huh? You used to be like a balloon!

415
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:43,770
- Was I also shorter?
- Yes!

416
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:48,691
Yes, you had a bad back. You walked
kinda hunched over, you know?

417
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,989
I was short <i>and</i> fat?

418
00:30:56,282 --> 00:30:58,910
Look, I'm sure you've got
a million questions.

419
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:02,997
You've been through hell. So, let's
just take this thing one step at a time.

420
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:04,999
First, let's meet the boys.

421
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:09,504
In the middle we've got the twins - Greg
and Charlie. He likes to invent things.

422
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:12,924
- Twins?
- Yeah. Obviously, they're not identical.

423
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:16,386
- Or I'd look like a shithead!
- Who asked you, butthole?!

424
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:19,889
They came out fighting
and they're still at it!

425
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:21,474
Guys, guys!

426
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,687
Charlie and I get along very well, Mom.
My twin brother and I are best friends.

427
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:27,522
He's the actor in the family.

428
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:31,234
Then we got the big guy!
11 pounds 5 ounces.

429
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,279
Come on, honey, give it a try.
What's his name?

430
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:40,702
Roy?

431
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:47,375
No. Travis. Sweet Trav?

432
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,627
- Now, those are tits!
- My turn!

433
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:51,838
Hey, what are you...?

434
00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:57,886
I was hopin' you'd recall this guy.
He's your newest, honey.

435
00:31:58,011 --> 00:32:00,472
Hi, Mom! My name's Joe.

436
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:04,559
- A falsetto child?
- Ah, he thinks he's Pee Wee Herman.

437
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:06,936
I love Pee Wee Herman. Ha ha!

438
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,355
- Give your ma a kiss.
- No! No! No!

439
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:13,359
Do they have a problem
with their glands?

440
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:17,238
Hey, hey, guys, easy! Come on!

441
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:19,616
It's not us, Dad, it's Roy!

442
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,662
Ah, they're great boys, aren't they?

443
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:26,664
There's so many of them.

444
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,959
You've always had
your heart set on six, so...

445
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:32,128
we'll just keep on tryin'.

446
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:35,048
Dad! They're making me drink blood!

447
00:32:35,715 --> 00:32:38,718
- Come back here!
- No, no, no!

448
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:41,679
They don't look anything like me!

449
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:45,850
They do take after your mother. Let's
hope they don't grow up to be lushes, too.

450
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,728
- My mother's a lush?
- Was, honey.

451
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:51,356
- Cirrhosis.
- She's...?

452
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,903
- What about my father?
- Oh, he's alive and well.

453
00:32:57,028 --> 00:33:00,990
- And due for parole in, what, two years?
- Oh, God! I don't wanna hear any more!

454
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:03,493
- Look...
- I just wanna remember for myself.

455
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:07,497
The doctor says the best thing for you
is to get back to your normal routine.

456
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:11,668
You gotta get your memory back that
way. You gotta do what you normally do.

457
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:15,171
What is it I normally do?

458
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:18,967
I prepared and handled raw food?

459
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:23,221
I hunt it. You cook it.

460
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:26,099
- You shot a chicken?
- Come on, honey!

461
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:28,351
Save the jokes! We're starvin' here.

462
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:29,894
Yeah!

463
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:32,313
It's strange, but... ooh!

464
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,151
I feel as if I've never done this
before in my life.

465
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:40,363
Dad, are you and Uncle Billy really
gonna open a miniature golf course?

466
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:43,032
Nah. We'll just build it
when someone pays for it.

467
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:46,661
- What's miniature golf?
- For midget brains, like you.

468
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,830
- I was only asking.
- You shut up!

469
00:33:57,797 --> 00:34:00,341
You're gonna make that turtle sick again.

470
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:03,803
You gotta breathe on it.

471
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,891
Look at me, Dad!

472
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:13,438
Nothing's happening.

473
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:17,275
Well, pumpkin, you gotta light the burner.

474
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:23,531
30 seconds.

475
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:27,076
29... 28... 27...

476
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:33,291
Fire, fire!

477
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,211
Hey, come here. Sit down.

478
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:40,006
- Let me see your hand.
- I smell hair!

479
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:42,842
I'll get the burn ointment.
You'll be all right.

480
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:45,011
Ouch!

481
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,233
OK, let's see, we...

482
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:00,568
Way to hustle, guys!

483
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:02,737
You all right?

484
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,573
Well, now we know they work.

485
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:10,286
- Pretty good eats!
- Should mashed potatoes be crunchy?

486
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:12,747
Where are you going?

487
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:17,627
Out! I go out every night after dinner.

488
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:21,214
Meet the boys at the bowling alley
for a couple of beers.

489
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:25,343
- Don't leave me alone with them!
- Come on, honey. That's not fair.

490
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:28,680
You know we live like this.
Never bothered you before.

491
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:31,808
It's just the way it is.
You'd better get used to it.

492
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,019
When are you coming home?

493
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:39,274
When I feel like it.
It just depends on how drunk I get.

494
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,376
How's it goin' with your debutante?

495
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:01,796
She's one lousy cook!
But as long as I don't have to do it.

496
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:06,342
- How long are you gonna keep her?
- Let's see. 25 bucks a day, huh?

497
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:12,223
Figure little wifey-poo can work off what
she owes me in... a little over a month.

498
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:15,351
- Your first night with her, huh?
- Mm-hm.

499
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:16,811
Uh-huh! Come on, huh!

500
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:21,900
I'm not gonna tell you
she doesn't have a great body.

501
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:25,069
And a pretty decent face...
Ah, she's too rich for my blood!

502
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:28,990
Chocolate cake's a bit rich too,
but I'd like to eat one once in a while.

503
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:32,035
Not my style.
Course, eating a whole cake isn't, either.

504
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,496
But I'm gonna have some fun
with her tonight!

505
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,082
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you drinkin'?

506
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,375
Some rotgut. Cheapest stuff they got.

507
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,336
Perfect.

508
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:44,923
Wait!

509
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:48,426
You jumped my bones
the first night we met!

510
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:53,098
- We did it on the first date?
- Well, I couldn't call it a date, really.

511
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:56,559
We just did it right there
in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven.

512
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,146
- I'm a slut.
- Huh?

513
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:01,689
Nothing.

514
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:04,400
- Ooh!
- Oh!

515
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:08,113
Hey, I'm a little drunk tonight,
baby, so, you know,

516
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,907
it might take me a while to get there.

517
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:14,285
Oh! What? No boom-boom?

518
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:17,956
Well, hey, I understand.

519
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:22,377
You probably just wanna go right
to sleep and skip the fun stuff, huh?

520
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:24,087
- Yes.
- OK.

521
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,589
Thank you. No boom-boom.

522
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,219
- Baby.
- Hm?

523
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:34,347
- The couch.
- What?

524
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:38,768
You see, honey, you've got a bad back
because the bed's too soft for you.

525
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:42,105
That's why you always sleep
on the living-room couch.

526
00:37:56,911 --> 00:38:00,874
I'm a short... fat... slut.

527
00:38:14,846 --> 00:38:17,307
Get off of my body!

528
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:19,476
Rover!

529
00:39:48,773 --> 00:39:52,026
- Up, up, up, up, up! Come on!
- Help! Help!

530
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:56,573
Time to get up. Gotta fix the kids' lunches
or they'll miss the bus for school.

531
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:59,451
I don't care if they don't go to school.

532
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:04,122
OK. They'll just be with you all day.

533
00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:07,584
Bye, Mom!

534
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:11,337
Whoa, whoa, the bus is here!
7.15, let's go!

535
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:13,214
Hurry up, Mom!

536
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:26,144
Roy. Roy!

537
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:29,272
My name is Travis.

538
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,817
Travis.

539
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,653
Travis!

540
00:40:38,698 --> 00:40:39,991
Come on, Joey.

541
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:41,618
Stop honking!

542
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,250
Twin! Oh, twin!

543
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,087
She means you.
Have a good day at school, honey.

544
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:56,132
You ready? You ready?
Come on, come on!

545
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,551
Bye, Mom. You're doin' a great job.

546
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:01,137
I'm off to work.

547
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,224
Somebody's gotta keep this family
in the lap of luxury.

548
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:09,395
I figured you'd forget,
so I made it for you myself.

549
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:12,482
- What?
- Your list of daily chores.

550
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:14,651
See ya tonight.

551
00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:17,612
- Dean?
- Zippety doo dah!

552
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,114
Zippety yay!

553
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:22,242
My oh my, I got a wonderful slave

554
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,411
And you are a genius!

555
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:42,637
You're living in a nightmare
that starts at the crack of dawn.

556
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:48,309
Down! Down!

557
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:55,483
<i>♪ Jim Dandy to the rescue ♪</i>

558
00:41:55,984 --> 00:41:58,486
<i>♪ Jim Dandy to the rescue ♪</i>

559
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:00,989
<i>♪ Jim Dandy to the rescue ♪</i>

560
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:04,033
<i>♪ Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy! ♪</i>

561
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:22,135
<i>♪ Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy! ♪</i>

562
00:42:24,763 --> 00:42:27,474
Dinner! Dinner!

563
00:43:43,383 --> 00:43:45,301
She needs food.

564
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,556
This is fun.

565
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,769
Hey, guys.

566
00:43:57,689 --> 00:44:00,900
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothing. We're OK. We're fine.

567
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:03,987
- How about you?
- Oh, no. What's wrong with her?

568
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:06,781
She's been like that for an hour now.

569
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,076
- She's getting better, though.
- Better?

570
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:12,245
Yeah, she's not going "Ba-ba-ba..."

571
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,582
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

572
00:44:15,707 --> 00:44:18,376
- Why did she do that?
- She destroyed the scarecrow.

573
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:20,336
She ripped the sucker's head off!

574
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:26,384
I like when she goes
"Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba."

575
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:28,219
Hey! Baby doll!

576
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:32,098
What's for dinner?

577
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:36,519
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu ba-ba-ha-ha...

578
00:44:36,644 --> 00:44:39,647
OK! I'll take it from here.
Go on, get upstairs!

579
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,403
- Will you trade her in for a new one?
- Nah, she'll be all right.

580
00:44:45,945 --> 00:44:47,989
Come on, guys! Move it!

581
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,373
Feel better?

582
00:44:57,499 --> 00:45:02,670
I don't belong here. I feel it.
Don't you think I feel it?

583
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:07,258
I can't do any of these vile things
and I wouldn't want to!

584
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,137
My life is like death!

585
00:45:11,262 --> 00:45:15,391
My children are the spawn of hell
and you're the devil.

586
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,560
Oh, God...

587
00:45:23,149 --> 00:45:26,111
Baby, we <i>like</i> you.

588
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:30,782
She's OK. She's doin' the dishes.

589
00:45:30,907 --> 00:45:34,160
- No more "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba".
- Good. All right.

590
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:35,453
- Dad?
- Yeah?

591
00:45:35,578 --> 00:45:39,290
- Will she figure out we're tricking her?
- Not if we don't blow it.

592
00:45:42,794 --> 00:45:45,880
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for memorabilia.

593
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:48,716
Memora-what?

594
00:45:49,384 --> 00:45:51,594
Scrapbooks. Photographs.

595
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:55,974
Something that will spark
some wisp of a memory.

596
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:58,560
Do we or do we not possess these things?

597
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:01,688
Uh, well...

598
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:05,108
Do you mean to tell me
there is no photographic evidence

599
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:09,070
of our life together...
anywhere in existence?

600
00:46:09,195 --> 00:46:12,574
Well, I don't know
where they'd be because, uh...

601
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:15,368
you know,
we lost a lot of stuff in the move.

602
00:46:15,493 --> 00:46:18,204
And it's possible that, uh...

603
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:20,707
we lost...

604
00:46:37,307 --> 00:46:39,517
The closet

605
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:42,729
and you.

606
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:49,110
That's right. This is me...
and I'm standing in front of the closet.

607
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:52,113
Something's familiar.

608
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:56,993
You got it. We used to do it in the closet.

609
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:59,037
Oh, stop with the sex stories!

610
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:01,623
You're grumpy
because you've been busy.

611
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:05,251
I want you to stop everything,
go on in here, take a bath...

612
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:08,046
Hey, guys!
Get the turtle out of the bathtub!

613
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:11,174
I'll look for the pictures
first thing in the morning, OK?

614
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:13,343
All right. Good night, honey.

615
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:51,089
- Somebody better be dead!
- Billy!

616
00:47:51,214 --> 00:47:53,174
Billy, I want you to do me a favour.

617
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:55,427
- Who you talkin' to?
- Nobody.

618
00:47:55,552 --> 00:47:56,886
- Who's that?
- No one.

619
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:58,471
Hey, is that Dean?

620
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:01,307
- Hi, Dean. Come on in.
- Go back to bed, Gertie.

621
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:03,653
If you treat me like
that, I'm goin' home.

622
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:05,794
Come on, Gertie,
don't be like that!

623
00:48:05,895 --> 00:48:09,107
Remember in high school you faked
our IDs? I need a fake bride.

624
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:12,944
- Come on, Dean. I'm busy!
- Not any more. She's goin' home.

625
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:15,697
OK, but if we get caught, it's your ass!

626
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:20,702
It's my wedding day.
Why do I look so annoyed?

627
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:23,204
Oh, yeah. Your dad showed up shit-faced.

628
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:26,624
He threw potato salad all over my mom.
We had to throw him out!

629
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,544
Why do I always have
this depressed look on my face?

630
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:33,506
You were grumpy a lot. You were losing
the weight, then you gained it back.

631
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:37,302
- Thin, fat, thin, fat.
- Was I <i>always</i> this miserable?

632
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:40,555
- Wasn't I ever happy?
- Well, sure, honey. Lots.

633
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,475
You were the happiest
little wife and mother around!

634
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,437
Look at this. Before you lost the weight.
Can you believe it?

635
00:48:49,606 --> 00:48:52,442
All right. Now, that's it.
Are you satisfied?

636
00:48:53,443 --> 00:48:55,487
- Yes.
- Good.

637
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:59,741
I suppose I belong here in this... hovel.

638
00:49:01,326 --> 00:49:03,369
Come on, Jackson!

639
00:49:04,287 --> 00:49:06,331
Well, this is my life.

640
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:09,000
I didn't marry very well, did I?

641
00:49:14,297 --> 00:49:16,341
<i>♪ Your body ♪</i>

642
00:49:16,466 --> 00:49:20,345
I love LA. I love all my starlets!

643
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,014
- What were your names again?
- Tofutti Klein.

644
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:25,100
Tofutti! I love it!

645
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:27,477
If that's my mother-in-law,
I'm not here.

646
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:30,249
You're Kim and Kimberly...

647
00:49:30,563 --> 00:49:33,399
- The Stayton yacht.
- <i>Hello, Andrew. It's Mrs Mintz</i>.

648
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:35,527
I'm so virile, I'm so rich!

649
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:37,737
<i>I'd like to speak to my daughter</i>.

650
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:40,407
<i>They're not here, madam.
They've gone shopping.</i>

651
00:49:45,912 --> 00:49:48,456
Uh, a little bit lower.

652
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:51,167
Yeah. Yeah, lower.

653
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:54,963
That's good. That's good.

654
00:49:56,589 --> 00:50:00,635
- Were you really in the Coast Guard?
- Damn right.

655
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,846
Why does he keep staring at me?

656
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:04,806
- Is he?
- Yes! He was staring at me

657
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:07,142
with his mouth open all through dinner.

658
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:11,187
Well, honey,
Billy was your high-school boyfriend.

659
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:16,693
You don't get any of the old feelings back
when you look at him, do you?

660
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:27,746
I don't wanna do it!

661
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:31,791
You gotta do it
if you wanna be a gruesome ghoul!

662
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:34,711
It's part of the initiation!
Think about it.

663
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:37,922
That's good. Thanks a lot. Ah, yeah.

664
00:50:39,424 --> 00:50:42,802
Uh, sugarlips.
I think our guest needs another beer.

665
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:46,723
Uh, well, I really shouldn't,
but maybe, uh... just one more

666
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,558
six-pack!

667
00:50:54,314 --> 00:50:56,274
- Attagirl!
- Thank you.

668
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:58,026
That's all the beer.

669
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:00,653
Whoa, buttercup!
Just about time for dessert!

670
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:03,364
- How about some brownies?
- I didn't make any.

671
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,409
- How about chocolate cream pie?
- I made that.

672
00:51:06,534 --> 00:51:10,330
- Is this gonna work?
- My ideas always work. I'm gifted.

673
00:51:10,455 --> 00:51:13,750
I loved it when you glued Joey
to the toilet seat.

674
00:51:16,086 --> 00:51:19,923
I was thinking about it at work.
We need a theme for the golf course.

675
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:24,803
We can use a few contraptions
you can knock some golf balls through.

676
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:28,264
- What's the score? I had my eyes closed.
- 32-10.

677
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:31,228
- Who's winning?
- The guys with 32.

678
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:45,365
- Great!
- Who did this?!

679
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:49,702
Travis!

680
00:51:49,828 --> 00:51:52,122
Hey, honey, what happened?

681
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:55,333
Oooh! <i>This</i> happened.

682
00:51:57,794 --> 00:52:01,798
- You guys are beggin' for it!
- Stop blustering! You won't punish them!

683
00:52:01,923 --> 00:52:04,551
Ease up there, love chop! Just ease up.

684
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:07,178
Ease up? Ease up?

685
00:52:08,054 --> 00:52:11,307
Since I walked through that door,
I have cooked, cleaned,

686
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:13,309
scrubbed, chopped wood.

687
00:52:13,435 --> 00:52:17,272
I've waited on you, your dogs,
your kids and your friends

688
00:52:17,397 --> 00:52:20,733
in the hopes that I would
remember some shred of my life

689
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:24,279
and now it is entirely clear to me
why I've chosen to block it out!

690
00:52:24,404 --> 00:52:27,282
- Now, none of this ever...
- Bothered me before.

691
00:52:27,407 --> 00:52:29,075
Well, it bothers me now.

692
00:52:31,578 --> 00:52:34,247
- All right, Joe!
- Is that so?

693
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:39,210
Hey, hey, Joe! Come on, guys!
No more jokes on Mom today, huh?

694
00:52:39,335 --> 00:52:41,463
You really got her where you want her.

695
00:52:41,588 --> 00:52:44,507
I got everything under control,
don't worry.

696
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:47,761
- This is flat. Give me another one, Billy.
- I only got six.

697
00:52:47,886 --> 00:52:51,598
We're just gonna have to send out
the old ball and chain to buy some more.

698
00:52:58,938 --> 00:53:00,899
Good stuff!

699
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:03,067
Your chocolate cream pie.

700
00:53:11,326 --> 00:53:12,952
Thanks, honey.

701
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:17,165
I guess it's kinda tough to serve
with your hands stuck to plates.

702
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:22,670
Honey, we need forks!

703
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,132
- Sugarlips!
- Yeah?

704
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,222
Wait a minute!

705
00:53:36,476 --> 00:53:38,520
Fire, fire, fire!

706
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:46,027
- Yeah!
- OK, guys, go get her!

707
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:53,410
Hey, thanks for a lovely dinner.

708
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,579
- She never did that before.
- She did it now!

709
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:59,582
- Look at this! I gotta go to work!
- Wait for me!

710
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,419
She went this way, guys!

711
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:05,004
Gruesome ghouls, attack!

712
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,841
- What should I do, Travis?
- Go home!

713
00:54:13,054 --> 00:54:14,472
I got you!

714
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,479
- Tickle her!
- She's ticklish!

715
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:24,149
Ow, that hurts! Ow!

716
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:27,986
Leave me alone!

717
00:54:29,738 --> 00:54:31,781
All right, time to get up.

718
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:35,869
Go to the bathroom
and do what you normally do.

719
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:38,955
- You gonna squirt us with a hose again?
- That's up to you.

720
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,209
- I gotta feed my turtle.
- The damn turtle stole my headband.

721
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:45,378
Joey, come on. Time to get up!

722
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:49,299
I don't want to!
The teacher's a big fat tub!

723
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:52,093
Proffitt boys, come up here!

724
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,017
Miss Pitcannon tells me
you don't wanna take these tests.

725
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:01,644
I'm itchin' and I wanna go home!

726
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:05,940
You may go stand in the corner
until you can talk like a little boy!

727
00:55:07,192 --> 00:55:09,944
All of you children
are new in this school.

728
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,656
These scores will determine
your placement in future classes.

729
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:17,744
- You must concentrate... Greg! Stop that!
- Make a face.

730
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:19,996
- I'm in real bad shape!
- Nonsense!

731
00:55:20,121 --> 00:55:24,667
Now, if you concentrate, I'm sure
you can control those little bodies.

732
00:55:25,627 --> 00:55:27,629
I see that, Amanda.

733
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:29,798
Joey, sit!

734
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,385
- Is anyone at your home?
- Yeah. Our mom is.

735
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:37,889
You have a mother now?
Your father remarried?

736
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:41,976
Um, yeah. We got a new mother now.

737
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:45,688
Well, good.
Then I'm calling <i>both</i> your parents!

738
00:55:51,277 --> 00:55:54,823
Mrs Burbridge, I'm Annie Proffitt.
What happened?

739
00:55:54,948 --> 00:55:59,452
Well, Mrs Proffitt, apparently
your children consider themselves

740
00:55:59,577 --> 00:56:02,288
above taking
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests.

741
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:05,291
I'm sorry. What are
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests?

742
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:10,839
Placement tests. They are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential.

743
00:56:10,964 --> 00:56:12,215
Sit still!

744
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,260
Your children are a discipline problem.

745
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:18,763
I know. I have had difficulties myself.

746
00:56:19,305 --> 00:56:22,642
- What did you do now?
- Oh! They decided to play sick!

747
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:25,228
And not very convincingly.

748
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:30,191
Now, I believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance.

749
00:56:30,316 --> 00:56:33,027
The children are slovenly, incorrigible

750
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:37,949
and being reared by a father who clearly
isn't concerned about their welfare,

751
00:56:38,074 --> 00:56:41,035
but is himself just a large child!

752
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:44,998
- Excuse me, Mrs Burbridge.
- Oh, the test results. Thank you.

753
00:56:45,123 --> 00:56:48,960
I'll look these over as soon as
I'm finished with this... <i>woman</i>.

754
00:56:49,085 --> 00:56:51,087
Oh, my God.

755
00:56:55,675 --> 00:56:58,470
I'll see you later in the cafeteria.

756
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:03,850
Mrs Burbridge,
would you come over here for a moment?

757
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:09,522
Has it escaped your attention that these
children have head-to-toe poison oak?

758
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:12,108
Well, no... Yes, but...

759
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:15,987
But what? My children are
in need of medical assistance!

760
00:57:16,112 --> 00:57:20,158
And you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests?

761
00:57:20,283 --> 00:57:24,829
Tests which label children's potential -
a thing which <i>cannot</i> be measured!

762
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:27,874
Least of all by anal-compulsive Huns!

763
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:33,755
And my husband may be a large child,
but that's none of your business.

764
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,466
And my children may be rotten,
but they're mine!

765
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:39,177
And I think that they're bright
and sensitive.

766
00:57:39,302 --> 00:57:42,514
So I have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence!

767
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,725
I do, however,
have serious doubts about yours!

768
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:49,020
Kids, get in the car. Let's go.

769
00:57:49,395 --> 00:57:50,396
Move!

770
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:56,152
- She told her off.
- Dad never did that.

771
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:59,572
Discipline problem?

772
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:03,118
My regards to
Schwartzman and Heinliken.

773
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:07,080
I can't stop itching!

774
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:11,334
Well, what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak?

775
00:58:12,752 --> 00:58:17,173
What I want you to do, what the doctor
said, is put it right on the red parts.

776
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:18,425
OK?

777
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,178
Soon we're going to clean up
this room because it's a disgrace.

778
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:25,974
- We like it like a disgrace.
- Dad lets us do whatever we want!

779
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,560
Yeah, well, it's trickling
down the stairway.

780
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:32,814
Joey, don't. Don't get that near your eyes.
Look, I want you to read this.

781
00:58:32,939 --> 00:58:36,317
See what it says?
"Don't get near your eyes." Read on.

782
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:47,245
- What's this all about?
- He's embarrassed cos he can't read.

783
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,749
- Well, he's a small child.
- He can't read for a small child either.

784
00:58:50,874 --> 00:58:53,793
The teacher makes fun of him!

785
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:58,089
OK, we'll talk about this later.
Go to sleep.

786
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:00,383
- Dean!
- Where is that?

787
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:01,968
- Dean!
- Yeah!

788
00:59:02,093 --> 00:59:04,095
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

789
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:07,015
Out. If I could ever find my...

790
00:59:07,515 --> 00:59:09,601
Oh, wait. Wait!

791
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:11,770
Not tonight! We have to talk.

792
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:15,899
- When I get home. I'm in a hurry.
- Now!

793
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:21,780
You know, I let the water routine slide by
the other day, but let's not push it, OK?

794
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:25,241
I got a little carried away with the hose,
but this is important.

795
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:27,911
OK, fine. What's on your mind, sugarlips?

796
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:31,414
Stop calling me sugarlips!
I have a name. Call me Annie.

797
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:34,876
Get to the point, <i>Annie</i>. I'm busy.
The guys are waitin' for me.

798
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:39,339
You can't run out every time things get
complicated here. The kids are sick!

799
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:42,133
They got calamine lotion.
What do you want me to do?

800
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:44,477
Take on some grown-up
responsibility!

801
00:59:44,502 --> 00:59:47,246
I earn the money.
That's a responsibility.

802
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:52,018
Are you aware that Joey can't read?
That Travis only reads smut magazines?

803
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:56,648
- I can't get him out of the bathroom.
- He's 13! I'll build you another bathroom!

804
00:59:56,773 --> 00:59:59,734
They don't need that!
They need guidance from you!

805
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:05,031
Oh-oh-oh! Now, don't you worry
about me and my boys, OK? We're pals.

806
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:07,659
They have enough pals.
They need a father.

807
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:11,663
Hey, hey, hey, look. I decided
a long time before you... you and me...

808
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:15,208
<i>We</i> decided a long time ago,
before we started this family,

809
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:18,753
we'd raise these kids naturally,
not force bullshit rules...

810
01:00:18,878 --> 01:00:21,548
I'm not talking about discipline.
I'm talking...

811
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:26,553
Stuff you shouldn't be talking about!
It's none of your business, anyway.

812
01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:30,682
- My children are none of my business?
- Look... I have... Now I'm late!

813
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:32,851
Thanks a lot! Appreciate it.

814
01:01:17,812 --> 01:01:20,440
Say, Annie. Are you asleep?

815
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:22,984
No. Go away.

816
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:24,903
Uh... listen. I'm...

817
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:28,364
I'm sorry I came down on you
so hard before.

818
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,826
It's OK.

819
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:36,623
Just so you won't think I don't appreciate
all the work you're doin' in the house

820
01:01:36,748 --> 01:01:39,834
and how you handle the kids
and all that, uh...

821
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:43,338
You know, I think you're doin' great.

822
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:48,259
I mean, what you said about me
and the boys tonight, uh...

823
01:01:49,177 --> 01:01:51,221
I guess you probably...

824
01:01:52,055 --> 01:01:56,392
You know, maybe you got a small point
there, and I just... I can't...

825
01:01:57,268 --> 01:01:59,729
I can't talk to you
while you're turned away.

826
01:01:59,854 --> 01:02:02,774
- Will you just please get your head out?
- No.

827
01:02:02,899 --> 01:02:04,943
- No!
- Why?

828
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,280
Because I'm so ugly.

829
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,659
I got poison oak, too!

830
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:16,579
Come on, now.
Nobody cares what you look like.

831
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:21,000
I mean, we do like the way you look.
Normally you look real pretty.

832
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:23,837
You just don't now.

833
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:26,589
All right, forget it.

834
01:02:27,382 --> 01:02:30,635
I don't even have a wedding ring!

835
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,723
- What?
- I lost my wedding ring in the sea.

836
01:02:37,016 --> 01:02:39,978
OK, come on. Come on.

837
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:42,814
Let's go.

838
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:46,818
Oh, no.
I'm not going back in the water barrel!

839
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:51,197
I'm puttin' you in the bedroom.
I'll take the couch.

840
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,451
Oh, hey, listen.
I've had poison oak a million times.

841
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:56,786
Come on, guys. Up! Up!

842
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:01,499
Yeah. You know,
I once got poison oak on my bu... back.

843
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,710
And, uh...

844
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:07,839
Well, don't you worry.
It'll be gone in no time. Lift your head.

845
01:03:07,964 --> 01:03:10,925
- That's it. Is that better?
- Yeah.

846
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,094
- All right?
- Yes.

847
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:18,266
Tell me something about my life,
about my past. Please.

848
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:21,311
Something not horrible.

849
01:03:22,437 --> 01:03:24,481
Uh, OK.

850
01:03:28,026 --> 01:03:32,447
Yeah. Well, there was that time, uh...

851
01:03:32,572 --> 01:03:34,157
when you were, uh...

852
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:36,534
You were working at...

853
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:39,245
yeah, Burger Boy over in Lewisville.

854
01:03:39,788 --> 01:03:43,666
And, uh, this kid started
choking on a French fry.

855
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:47,295
Everybody there panicked,
including me, except for you.

856
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:53,093
You ran over to him and you gave him
that Heimlich manoeuvre, where you...

857
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:56,513
And poof! The kid puked up the fry

858
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:59,474
and they named you
Burger Boy employee of the month.

859
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,895
It was great. They put your picture
above the cash register and...

860
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,773
I was really proud of you. I mean it.

861
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,862
You can be quite charming
when you wanna be.

862
01:04:13,947 --> 01:04:16,866
Ah. You just caught me on a bad day.

863
01:04:19,953 --> 01:04:22,163
Good night... Annie.

864
01:04:23,748 --> 01:04:25,792
Good night.

865
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:36,127
- Heads up!
- After I finished with the Coast Guard,

866
01:04:36,227 --> 01:04:39,097
I looked up Dean.
We used to play football together.

867
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:42,934
Used to call him Mean Dean Proffitt.
Used to call me Bad Billy Pratt.

868
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:45,520
- Out!
- Now, Billy, when did we date?

869
01:04:48,314 --> 01:04:50,358
Let's eat!

870
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,237
- It might be...
- Are we talking about the golf course?

871
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:57,240
Yeah. The guys with suits
come down in less than a week.

872
01:04:57,365 --> 01:04:59,159
What do you think about this, huh?

873
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:02,579
Sink 'Em and Drink 'Em.
18 holes based on famous breweries.

874
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:05,415
I think what I thought yesterday.
It's a lousy idea.

875
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,168
I thought you'd change your mind
now you're sober.

876
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:11,379
What about other places? Foreign places.

877
01:05:11,504 --> 01:05:13,548
What do you mean?
Like France or Africa?

878
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:16,092
<i>Mais oui!
La Tour Eiffel, comme c'est jolie!</i>

879
01:05:16,217 --> 01:05:18,845
I speak French!

880
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,015
It just came out.

881
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,350
Do I know what I said?

882
01:05:24,476 --> 01:05:26,269
Yes, I do.

883
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,521
I must have learned that in Paris.

884
01:05:29,606 --> 01:05:31,649
When was I in Paris?

885
01:05:32,525 --> 01:05:34,611
In the Navy.

886
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:37,822
- Navy.
- Well, it's a stupid idea in any language.

887
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:40,617
Besides, we're building
these things in America.

888
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:43,203
Wait a minute. This isn't a bad idea.

889
01:05:43,328 --> 01:05:45,872
I could invent some wild things here.
Go on.

890
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:49,667
Well, like, uh... the Taj Mahal,
Seven Wonders of the World.

891
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:54,089
- Bring them to the people of Elk Cove!
- Well, I gotta bring it in for a price.

892
01:05:54,214 --> 01:05:57,008
I can bring it in,
but can you draw me some pictures

893
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,761
so I can see what you mean? Annie?

894
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:06,810
- What's this?
- Travis found a girlfriend.

895
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:09,979
Hey, Trav! Don't knock her up!

896
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,776
- Very funny! Watch your...
- Oh, Mom!

897
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:17,112
Yeah, "Oh, Mom!" Watch your language!

898
01:06:17,237 --> 01:06:19,572
Come on! What are you talkin' about?

899
01:06:19,697 --> 01:06:22,784
- Pick a wonder.
- Stevie Wonder.

900
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,913
- Give me a wonder. One wonder.
- There's Mount Rushmore.

901
01:06:27,038 --> 01:06:29,082
- The Parthenon.
- Parthenon, right.

902
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:33,461
- St Basil's, the Russian cathedral.
- Grand Canyon. Everybody'll love that!

903
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:35,964
- Egyptian pyramids.
- The Eiffel Tower.

904
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:41,177
It's expensive. I gotta build...
If it rains... Hey, fibreglass! Perfect!

905
01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:47,976
Let's clean up for an early dinner.
I've got a lot of drawing to do.

906
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:50,145
Isn't Dad gonna eat with us tonight?

907
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,564
No! He had to go out.

908
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,109
- He had to go bowling this time.
- Really?

909
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:59,195
It's pretty hard to go bowling
without a bowling ball.

910
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:18,339
I know I done you wrong

911
01:07:18,465 --> 01:07:21,509
Do you remember
that rainy evening I put you out

912
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:23,154
With nothin' but a fine-toothed comb

913
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:25,430
What would you want
with old sweet-mouth?

914
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:28,057
Ain't that a shame, I know I'm to blame

915
01:07:28,183 --> 01:07:31,686
Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home?

916
01:07:35,982 --> 01:07:39,819
<i>Scott Murphy,
bring your invoice up to the front.</i>

917
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:43,490
This ain't your average
pile of fertiliser here.

918
01:07:43,615 --> 01:07:48,244
Uh-uh. No, siree.
This here's a special blend.

919
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:53,374
Fish heads, shrimp skins,
crab claws, earthworm droppings...

920
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,794
I don't wanna know that much about it.

921
01:07:55,919 --> 01:07:59,005
- Here you go.
- After this, you get to shovel fish guts!

922
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:01,633
If you're lucky,
we'll let you clean the truck!

923
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:06,471
- Whoops! I forgot to give you this.
- What have I got to put on airs for?

924
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:08,640
Oh, stop fussing. You look great.

925
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:12,936
Well, they put their pants on
just like me - one leg at a time.

926
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,188
Now, don't be nervous, OK?

927
01:08:15,313 --> 01:08:17,232
If you don't get it, so what?

928
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:20,693
We've been through
rougher times than these before.

929
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:22,862
I think.

930
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:32,372
Gentlemen, this is Dean Proffitt,
inventor and master craftsman.

931
01:08:33,206 --> 01:08:35,375
What we're here for this evening is this.

932
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,379
It's the Wonders of the World
miniature golf course.

933
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:43,383
If you look at these pictures,
you can begin to sort of feel...

934
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:47,512
What we're trying to do is bring some
of this outer world here into Elk Cove.

935
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:50,807
The Leaning Tower of Pizza
doubles as a pizza stand.

936
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:54,644
That sort of gives us an idea
of where we might go in the future.

937
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:58,690
Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Here, let me get that.

938
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:01,025
Waitress! Get over here, will you?

939
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,863
Have you ever been nervous in your life?

940
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,372
Go ahead, ask me.
Ask me if we got the money.

941
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:16,124
Did you get the money?

942
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:18,626
- We got the money!
- Oooh, great!

943
01:09:18,752 --> 01:09:21,254
- That's so great!
- Can you believe it?!

944
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:32,974
Step up! She rolls up here... and down.

945
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:37,812
It's got three choices. This time,
it's going through the oil funnel,

946
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:42,067
past the plastic fan, into the
kids' sand shovel and flour sifter.

947
01:09:42,192 --> 01:09:46,780
Now, turn around quick. Here it comes.
It should be out about now.

948
01:09:46,905 --> 01:09:49,145
- OK, now show me your invention.
- You're gonna hate it.

949
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,034
I'm not gonna hate it. I love 'em.

950
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:57,957
That's nice.

951
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:07,008
I gotta tell her, Billy.
I gotta tell Annie the truth.

952
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:10,220
In the beginning, it was OK
because it was part of a gag.

953
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:13,723
Now it's more like lies. I...
I know what you're thinkin'.

954
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:17,477
- Hey, I'm not thinkin' anything.
- Yeah, you are and I'm gonna tell her.

955
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:19,646
I know it's time to tell her!

956
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,777
Ooh, Dr Death looks mad.

957
01:10:25,902 --> 01:10:29,572
- Joker's saying "No".
- I know. What does he say up here?

958
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:33,076
"I will re... re... re..."

959
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:38,081
- Reduce.
- "Reduce your puny planet to rub..."

960
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,000
- Ru... ru...
- Rubble.

961
01:10:41,126 --> 01:10:43,837
Good! That's very good, sweetie.

962
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:47,382
Are you gonna leave?

963
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:51,219
No. I'm your mommy.

964
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:54,472
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Sometimes moms leave.

965
01:10:55,181 --> 01:10:58,601
Well, I guess maybe they do.
But I'm not gonna go anywhere.

966
01:10:58,726 --> 01:11:00,770
Good.

967
01:11:02,272 --> 01:11:04,733
Oooh, what is this?
Is this a present for me?

968
01:11:04,858 --> 01:11:08,570
- Yes. I made it from macaroni.
- I love it.

969
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,239
I'll always wear it.

970
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:14,826
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi! How's it goin', guys?

971
01:11:14,951 --> 01:11:17,370
I got the part of Tiny Tim
in the school play.

972
01:11:17,495 --> 01:11:19,914
- I got an A in English.
- I'm flunkin' math.

973
01:11:20,832 --> 01:11:23,835
Well, I guess we better
work on it later on, huh?

974
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,005
You're just in time.
Dr Death is on the rampage.

975
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:30,592
Annie, I need to talk to you.

976
01:11:30,717 --> 01:11:32,761
Alone, guys.

977
01:11:36,723 --> 01:11:39,476
- Is something wrong?
- Uh, well...

978
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,187
No. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

979
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:46,024
No, I just... I need to tell you somethin'.
Here, sit down.

980
01:11:46,608 --> 01:11:48,651
What is it?

981
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:53,239
Annie, I've done...
I've done something that, um...

982
01:11:53,364 --> 01:11:55,992
I'm ashamed of. And I just...

983
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:59,162
- I already know.
- You do?

984
01:12:01,581 --> 01:12:06,127
- What... What do you know?
- You work nights at the fertiliser plant.

985
01:12:09,255 --> 01:12:12,967
You don't have to be ashamed
because you shovel fish guts.

986
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,679
I'm proud of you no matter what you do.

987
01:12:16,805 --> 01:12:17,816
Is that it?

988
01:12:17,841 --> 01:12:20,874
Uh, well, that's one of the
things, but I...

989
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:24,354
No. Not really.

990
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:27,065
What is it?

991
01:12:32,612 --> 01:12:34,864
Annie...

992
01:12:39,327 --> 01:12:41,371
I...

993
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:45,083
I... God, I forgot your birthday.

994
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,753
- It's my birthday?
- Come on! Get dressed!

995
01:12:55,135 --> 01:12:57,387
Jim Dandy to the rescue

996
01:12:58,221 --> 01:13:00,390
Jim Dandy to the rescue

997
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:03,435
Jim Dandy to the rescue

998
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,479
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

999
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:09,524
I'm sittin' on a mountain top

1000
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:12,652
30,000 feet to drop

1001
01:13:12,777 --> 01:13:15,655
Spied a lady on a runaway horse

1002
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,991
Uh-huh, that's right, of course!

1003
01:13:18,533 --> 01:13:20,785
Jim Dandy to the rescue

1004
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,913
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

1005
01:13:24,622 --> 01:13:28,251
- Come on, I've had it!
- What? Are we goin' home?

1006
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:30,128
- What?
- Are we going home?

1007
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:33,039
- Oh, no. I just... Aren't you hot?
- Yeah. Let's go outside.

1008
01:13:33,165 --> 01:13:34,278
Come on!

1009
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:36,742
Hey, let's not forget this.
It's $7 a pop.

1010
01:13:36,843 --> 01:13:40,680
Don't worry about what it costs.
It's your birthday! I got it covered.

1011
01:13:43,183 --> 01:13:45,852
Just one last toast to your birthday.

1012
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:48,980
Oh! Whoops, I lost my bottom.

1013
01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:50,690
Wait a minute.

1014
01:13:51,066 --> 01:13:54,235
There! They always do that. Now, this is...

1015
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,529
- Happy birthday, Annie.
- Thanks, Dean.

1016
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:01,670
I've never tasted
anything quite like this.

1017
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:02,893
It's good stuff.

1018
01:14:03,578 --> 01:14:05,997
Boy, it sure is pretty, isn't it?

1019
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,793
Why do they honk three times?

1020
01:14:09,918 --> 01:14:11,961
To signal they're comin' home.

1021
01:14:12,087 --> 01:14:17,258
Yeah, it's a legend... of Arturo,
who was a Portuguese fisherman.

1022
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:21,096
He met this beautiful girl
his first night in town - Catarina.

1023
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:24,057
And, um, eventually they fell in love.

1024
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:28,186
But the problem was that Catarina's
father was the territorial governor.

1025
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:31,606
He didn't want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman.

1026
01:14:31,731 --> 01:14:34,692
So he told Arturo
that he'd have to ship off,

1027
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:38,446
which he did, but he told Catarina
he'd be back for her

1028
01:14:38,571 --> 01:14:42,492
and when he came back,
he'd signal with three long blasts

1029
01:14:42,617 --> 01:14:47,080
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat, and they'd be on their way.

1030
01:14:47,205 --> 01:14:49,082
Oh, I love this story.

1031
01:14:49,207 --> 01:14:52,127
So, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1032
01:14:52,252 --> 01:14:54,587
But when she was swimmin' out
to the boat,

1033
01:14:54,712 --> 01:14:58,383
the fog got so thick that, uh,
she couldn't find the boat.

1034
01:14:59,259 --> 01:15:02,971
Arturo panicked
and he called out "Catarina! Catarina!"

1035
01:15:03,096 --> 01:15:05,056
Catarina yelled back "Arturo!"

1036
01:15:05,181 --> 01:15:09,436
With that, he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters, and they...

1037
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:11,938
- Kissed.
- No, they drowned.

1038
01:15:12,063 --> 01:15:14,566
They never found each other
and they drowned.

1039
01:15:14,691 --> 01:15:18,445
- Oh, that's a terrible story!
- Yeah, but the legend is

1040
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:22,699
they reunited at the bottom of the sea,
right over there,

1041
01:15:22,824 --> 01:15:27,287
and every time you see
the spray goin' up, it's them.

1042
01:15:27,412 --> 01:15:30,707
- Making love?
- Yeah.

1043
01:15:30,832 --> 01:15:32,876
For ever and ever.

1044
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:46,139
For I can't help

1045
01:15:46,848 --> 01:15:52,145
Falling in love...

1046
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,314
Dean?

1047
01:15:55,732 --> 01:15:57,776
What, Annie?

1048
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:00,403
How old am I?

1049
01:16:05,784 --> 01:16:07,827
29.

1050
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:12,308
- Dean.
- Yeah?

1051
01:17:13,268 --> 01:17:15,311
Was it always like this?

1052
01:17:17,272 --> 01:17:19,941
Every time with you is like the first time.

1053
01:17:45,383 --> 01:17:47,177
Oh, come on, guys!

1054
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:49,554
Hey, let us sleep for a while!

1055
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,723
Right, that's it! I'm gonna spank 'em.

1056
01:17:51,848 --> 01:17:55,727
- No! Dean, please don't.
- Every one of them's gonna get it!

1057
01:17:56,519 --> 01:17:57,937
Surprise!

1058
01:17:58,063 --> 01:18:00,356
- A washing machine!
- Do you like it?

1059
01:18:01,107 --> 01:18:03,443
Honey, it's so expensive.

1060
01:18:03,568 --> 01:18:05,612
No shit!

1061
01:18:07,906 --> 01:18:09,741
Thank you.

1062
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:13,161
She might have no tits
but she has a nice ass.

1063
01:18:29,302 --> 01:18:31,137
Grant?

1064
01:18:31,262 --> 01:18:33,098
Edith. Hello.

1065
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:37,185
This is ludicrous, Grant.
I have called every week for two months.

1066
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,312
<i>I've looked forward to each call</i>.

1067
01:18:39,437 --> 01:18:42,607
Do you have the gall to tell me
that I've missed her again?

1068
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:45,360
- She's sleeping.
- <i>I don't believe you</i>.

1069
01:18:45,485 --> 01:18:47,862
<i>Grant, if you do not produce Joanna</i>

1070
01:18:47,987 --> 01:18:53,243
in one week, I am going to hire a mass
of mercenaries to hunt you down

1071
01:18:53,368 --> 01:18:57,247
and chop off the protruding parts
of your body. Is that clear?

1072
01:18:57,372 --> 01:19:00,542
I'll find her. I mean, you'll have
your daughter soon. Bye!

1073
01:19:01,459 --> 01:19:04,879
Andrew. Point the boat back to Elk Snout.

1074
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:08,550
You and Mommy are going
to take a little trip, aren't we?

1075
01:19:08,675 --> 01:19:11,052
We's gonna go bye-bye, yes!

1076
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:18,017
- Sit there and don't get dirty!
- I hate this.

1077
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:21,020
It's not so bad to get dressed up
every once in a while.

1078
01:19:21,146 --> 01:19:23,398
It's like the goddamn Brady Bunch!

1079
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:27,736
- Dad's here!
- Mom, Dad's home!

1080
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:29,904
Hey, guys!

1081
01:19:31,156 --> 01:19:34,242
I gotta go put on a suit.
Gertie's picking me up.

1082
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:36,911
How can you go hunting
on such an important day?

1083
01:19:37,036 --> 01:19:41,166
- Easy. Pheasant don't play miniature golf.
- Hunting calms Billy down, honey.

1084
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:45,795
- The ceremonies start in an hour.
- Billy, hang this guy out.

1085
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,131
Sweetie, I'll be ready... in a second.

1086
01:19:48,256 --> 01:19:51,634
I lent the station wagon to Gertie
so we have to take the truck.

1087
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,595
God! What a mess.

1088
01:19:56,014 --> 01:19:58,057
Feathers!

1089
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:10,862
"JS".

1090
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:14,991
Honey, would you hand me a towel there?

1091
01:20:15,116 --> 01:20:16,993
Thanks.

1092
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:19,079
What... What is this?

1093
01:20:19,204 --> 01:20:21,664
No, that's my question.
They were in the truck.

1094
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,085
These are... I dunno what these are.
I... Who...

1095
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:28,046
Here. I, uh, we gotta get going.
We're gonna be late.

1096
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:30,340
Thanks for putting my clothes on the bed.

1097
01:20:30,465 --> 01:20:32,801
- Oh, stop it!
- This is nothing!

1098
01:20:32,926 --> 01:20:36,054
Nothing?
I gave you the best years of my life.

1099
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:38,181
I've raised your children.

1100
01:20:38,306 --> 01:20:41,810
I bore your fruit four times
and you tell me this is nothing?

1101
01:20:41,935 --> 01:20:44,354
You're making a big deal
out of a little thing.

1102
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:47,399
It's the number one cause
of divorce in this country.

1103
01:20:47,524 --> 01:20:50,568
Where's my jacket? What divorce?
What are you saying...

1104
01:20:50,693 --> 01:20:54,114
- I'm saying what I'm saying.
- You're saying what you're saying!

1105
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,325
- What, you wanna divorce?
- Well, uh... yeah, maybe I do!

1106
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:00,912
- Well, you can't have one.
- Oh, really. I can have a divorce.

1107
01:21:01,037 --> 01:21:04,833
- Where did I put my damn boots?
- I can get a divorce if I want to.

1108
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:07,419
I don't need your permission.

1109
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:11,464
Do you love her?

1110
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:16,553
Do you?

1111
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:19,639
Tell me.

1112
01:21:19,764 --> 01:21:22,684
Honestly? Yes and no.

1113
01:21:23,268 --> 01:21:27,397
- More yes than no?
- This is unbelievable! How did you...?!

1114
01:21:27,522 --> 01:21:30,775
I'm glad this happened.

1115
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,550
I've been tryin' to
figure out a way to tell

1116
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:35,929
you this for ever.
Come here. Sit down.

1117
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:38,074
I wanna tell you something.

1118
01:21:39,325 --> 01:21:44,122
JS is you. These are yours and we're not
married. There. God, I finally said it!

1119
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:46,291
What's her name? Jacqueline? Josie?

1120
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:49,043
Honey, I'm not your husband
and you're not my wife.

1121
01:21:49,169 --> 01:21:52,338
Is she from that fertiliser plant?
Does she hand out shovels?

1122
01:21:52,464 --> 01:21:55,550
These aren't your kids!
You didn't bear anything!

1123
01:21:55,675 --> 01:21:58,762
- Don't change the subject! Who is she?!
- Forget it! Come here!

1124
01:22:00,305 --> 01:22:04,225
- Guys, we gotta talk and this is serious.
- Mom, we're still all clean!

1125
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:08,480
I just told her about her not being your
mother and I want you to tell her, too.

1126
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:15,779
- Go ahead, tell her.
- Dad, tell her what?

1127
01:22:15,904 --> 01:22:18,907
- Tell her she's not your mother.
- But she is our mother!

1128
01:22:19,032 --> 01:22:23,495
No. Don't tell her what I told you to
tell her. Just tell her the truth now, OK?

1129
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:26,664
- Tell her about the day she came home!
- She went for a swim.

1130
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:29,501
We were really worried.
I was up all night pacing.

1131
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:34,214
- You'd never seen her before!
- Don't speak to my children that way!

1132
01:22:36,132 --> 01:22:39,719
- What do you think you're doing?
- We won't let you ruin <i>everything</i>.

1133
01:22:39,844 --> 01:22:42,388
- We're keepin' her.
- She doesn't belong to you!

1134
01:22:42,514 --> 01:22:45,183
She didn't belong to you,
but that didn't stop you!

1135
01:22:45,308 --> 01:22:47,769
- I had my reasons!
- So do we.

1136
01:22:48,853 --> 01:22:50,897
- We like her, Dad!
- You like her, do you?

1137
01:22:51,022 --> 01:22:54,150
So much you'd rather live with her
than your own father?!

1138
01:23:01,157 --> 01:23:04,953
- Found 'em in the glove compartment?
- Yeah. Tell me every sordid detail.

1139
01:23:05,078 --> 01:23:07,622
Who is JS and what does she do to Dean?

1140
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:10,708
- Annie...
- Tell me everything. Be honest with me.

1141
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:13,920
Annie, uh... That's my underwear.

1142
01:23:15,588 --> 01:23:18,883
- What?
- I don't mean I wear it or anything.

1143
01:23:19,008 --> 01:23:21,719
- It belongs to a girlfriend.
- What about Gertie?

1144
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:25,640
I strayed. See, I got lucky
with this phone-sex girl one night.

1145
01:23:25,765 --> 01:23:28,435
I found one that accepted
personal cheques and...

1146
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,564
You see, I don't have a back seat
in my truck so I... I used yours.

1147
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:35,817
Dean doesn't want you to tell Gert,
so he's covering for me.

1148
01:23:35,942 --> 01:23:39,279
- What are you talking about?
- I confessed. The jig is up.

1149
01:23:39,404 --> 01:23:42,198
The jig <i>is</i> up!
I'm finally trying to tell her the truth.

1150
01:23:42,323 --> 01:23:45,072
I just did.
See, I didn't get the reputation

1151
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:47,478
for being Bad Billy
Pratt by accident.

1152
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:49,873
Annie, I'm sorry.

1153
01:23:49,998 --> 01:23:52,041
I got horny.

1154
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:55,086
- Do you hate me?
- Oh, no, I don't hate you.

1155
01:23:55,754 --> 01:23:59,716
- I'm glad you're bad, Billy Pratt.
- Biggest load of bullshit I've seen.

1156
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:04,721
Honey, honey. Phone-for-sex girls
don't come to your truck, honey. They...

1157
01:24:04,846 --> 01:24:08,475
No, stop trying to cover for him, sweetie.
Let's just forget it.

1158
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,562
Pretty expensive panties.
You can have these back.

1159
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:15,190
That girl must have more than one phone.

1160
01:24:16,775 --> 01:24:18,610
Pretty good, huh?

1161
01:24:18,735 --> 01:24:22,113
You did this to protect your ass
because you faked my pictures?

1162
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:26,409
No, I did it to protect <i>your</i> ass, OK?
You belong with her.

1163
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:48,098
Oh, cute.

1164
01:24:48,223 --> 01:24:51,226
Mom! Help, he has my hand.

1165
01:24:51,351 --> 01:24:54,646
Why do you stick your hands
in people's mouths, anyway?

1166
01:24:54,771 --> 01:24:56,898
Let's go. Let's go to another one.

1167
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:10,328
I have been calling all over Elk Cove.

1168
01:25:10,453 --> 01:25:15,625
No, no. Don't worry. No, no.
I will try Portland for a limousine.

1169
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:19,921
I really don't have anything
to say except that, uh...

1170
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:24,801
there would be no Wonders of the World
miniature golf course if it wasn't for

1171
01:25:24,926 --> 01:25:28,138
the imagination
and the creativity of one woman.

1172
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:32,267
That's my Annie.
Annie, you wanna come up here?

1173
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:40,942
I love you, Annie.
I want you to be with me always.

1174
01:25:55,749 --> 01:25:58,585
Everybody, play ball!

1175
01:26:01,588 --> 01:26:03,590
Let's go clean up.

1176
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:40,710
- Hey, Dad! Whose car is that?
- Maybe it's a rich relative.

1177
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:45,757
- Sure, it's Daddy Warbucks!
- Maybe we won the lottery.

1178
01:27:05,527 --> 01:27:09,322
Hi, Grant!
I just have to put these in some water.

1179
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:28,299
Grant? Is that you?

1180
01:27:33,805 --> 01:27:36,266
Yes.

1181
01:27:36,391 --> 01:27:39,602
Yes, you're Grant Stayton III.

1182
01:27:41,688 --> 01:27:43,815
I remember!

1183
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,527
I remember. I'm Joanna Stayton.

1184
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:54,325
Ooh! Dean, I'm cured.

1185
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:56,494
I can remember again.

1186
01:27:57,203 --> 01:27:58,872
Oh, God!

1187
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:02,500
You can't imagine how terrible it is
not to know who you are.

1188
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:06,921
The doctor said that my mind would
come back suddenly and he was right.

1189
01:28:07,046 --> 01:28:10,884
I saw you, I walked past you into the
house and poof! My memory came back.

1190
01:28:11,009 --> 01:28:14,387
Ask me anything.
Ask me about my childhood in New York.

1191
01:28:14,512 --> 01:28:16,806
Uh, about my mom. Her name is Edith.

1192
01:28:16,931 --> 01:28:18,933
About my money. Money!

1193
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:22,645
I have money! I have lots of money!
I even have some in Switzerland!

1194
01:28:22,771 --> 01:28:24,814
- Switzerland?
- See how I know me?

1195
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:27,525
Oh, God, this is
the happiest day of my life!

1196
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,195
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for bringing me here

1197
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,822
and making me a wife and a mother and...

1198
01:28:32,947 --> 01:28:34,991
Why did you do that?

1199
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:41,164
Why...?

1200
01:28:41,289 --> 01:28:43,333
I know why.

1201
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:47,962
You're that sweaty carpenter
who hates me.

1202
01:28:54,344 --> 01:28:57,347
And these are your children,
and you made me

1203
01:28:58,556 --> 01:29:00,767
believe that...

1204
01:29:06,648 --> 01:29:08,775
Oh, God...

1205
01:29:10,652 --> 01:29:12,695
You tricked me.

1206
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,324
You used me.

1207
01:29:20,578 --> 01:29:22,622
Say something.

1208
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:28,253
- Annie, it just started out...
- My name is not Annie.

1209
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,674
And I don't belong with you.

1210
01:29:34,717 --> 01:29:36,761
And I don't belong with them.

1211
01:29:38,722 --> 01:29:41,391
I have to... get my things.

1212
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:50,650
Don't get any ideas. I brought Olaf.

1213
01:29:50,775 --> 01:29:52,152
Olaf!

1214
01:29:56,156 --> 01:29:58,116
I think we can take Olaf.

1215
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,176
I won't have...

1216
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:21,473
There's nothing inside that's mine.

1217
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:34,360
Joanna, for whatever it's worth,

1218
01:30:35,862 --> 01:30:37,113
thank you.

1219
01:30:49,876 --> 01:30:51,920
Come on, dear.

1220
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:57,842
We'll get you out of these clothes.

1221
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:22,367
- Mom, wait!
- Mom!

1222
01:31:22,492 --> 01:31:25,286
- Mom!
- Mom, come back!

1223
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,095
- You said moms don't leave!
- Get!

1224
01:31:58,361 --> 01:32:00,655
We should have told her, Dad.

1225
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,824
She just would have left sooner.

1226
01:32:04,325 --> 01:32:06,369
Come on.

1227
01:32:29,392 --> 01:32:31,436
Welcome back, Mrs Stayton.

1228
01:33:16,815 --> 01:33:20,777
Dr Korman, will she ever again
be the debutante I raised?

1229
01:33:20,902 --> 01:33:24,739
- Will she be one of us?
- Joanna wants to rediscover her old self.

1230
01:33:25,323 --> 01:33:27,700
Her memory's almost
completely restored.

1231
01:33:27,826 --> 01:33:30,370
She even recalled the session
where I wrote this.

1232
01:33:30,495 --> 01:33:34,332
I love you madly
though you treat me badly...

1233
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:36,835
Dr Korman! Please!

1234
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,922
We need analysis, not "Moon River"!
I want my wife back.

1235
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:44,592
Joanna knows who she is.
And she's trying to behave that way.

1236
01:33:44,717 --> 01:33:45,802
Happy?

1237
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:48,138
Good evening, madam.

1238
01:33:48,263 --> 01:33:52,350
- Ah, my darling Joanna.
- You look radiant, Jo-Jo.

1239
01:33:52,475 --> 01:33:56,062
Oh, please don't call me that.
I feel like a Pomeranian.

1240
01:33:56,187 --> 01:33:59,232
You liked being called Jo-Jo.
It was diddums you hated.

1241
01:33:59,357 --> 01:34:04,154
Mother, why does Dr Korman have to be here?
I feel self-conscious enough as it is.

1242
01:34:04,279 --> 01:34:08,158
Oh, sweetie. Just indulge Mommy, hm?

1243
01:34:08,283 --> 01:34:11,286
Come along, now. Sit, sit, sit.

1244
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:13,455
Andrew, I'm sitting.

1245
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:18,877
Now, Mrs Mintz.

1246
01:34:19,627 --> 01:34:24,215
Dr Korman knows you so well, dear,
and he only wants to help.

1247
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:27,469
- Champagne, madam.
- Ah, thank you, Andrew.

1248
01:34:29,387 --> 01:34:32,265
- Andrew, I'd love a beer.
- A beer?

1249
01:34:33,391 --> 01:34:36,895
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- Nothing is ever wrong.

1250
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:41,816
Actually, I really don't see the harm
in accommodating her wishes, Andrew.

1251
01:34:43,735 --> 01:34:47,572
- Cigarette, darling?
- I don't smoke, Mother. Do I?

1252
01:34:47,697 --> 01:34:49,991
Of course you smoke.
You've always smoked.

1253
01:34:50,116 --> 01:34:52,660
- I smoke.
- Why don't we all smoke?

1254
01:34:53,536 --> 01:34:57,123
Why do I have to smoke? I've never
smoked. I get sick when I smoke.

1255
01:34:57,248 --> 01:34:59,959
Why does everyone try to make me
do what I don't want to do?

1256
01:35:00,085 --> 01:35:03,588
Grant, we are not interested
in <i>your</i> therapy.

1257
01:35:03,713 --> 01:35:08,468
I had my nervous breakdown and
I didn't have therapy. I never had therapy!

1258
01:35:09,594 --> 01:35:12,180
- Mother, would you like some?
- I'd love some.

1259
01:35:12,305 --> 01:35:15,725
Put that down! Good God, Joanna!
We have servants for that.

1260
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:17,852
Now, really, this is going too far.

1261
01:35:17,977 --> 01:35:21,356
Joanna, what motivated you
to rise and go get the serving tray?

1262
01:35:22,982 --> 01:35:25,735
Well, I thought you might be hungry.

1263
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:28,613
- That's excellent.
- What's excellent about it?

1264
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:32,325
- I was hungry.
- Your beer, madam.

1265
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:35,286
Who cares that you were hungry!
She became a waitress!

1266
01:35:35,412 --> 01:35:37,872
- My daughter's a waitress?!
- Hold it.

1267
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,335
Mm!

1268
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,504
Good stuff.

1269
01:35:52,095 --> 01:35:54,931
I'll stay an extra few days, yes.

1270
01:36:06,234 --> 01:36:08,653
- They won't come in.
- Shit.

1271
01:36:16,244 --> 01:36:18,413
Spaghettio Surprise.

1272
01:36:26,588 --> 01:36:29,424
- What's goin' on?
- We're gettin' Mom back.

1273
01:36:29,549 --> 01:36:32,886
- We miss her.
- Yeah, she cuts the crusts off the bread.

1274
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:36,473
She doesn't take any of my shit either.
I need discipline.

1275
01:36:36,598 --> 01:36:38,141
We got $3.04.

1276
01:36:38,266 --> 01:36:41,311
We're gonna rent a fishing boat
and get her back.

1277
01:36:41,436 --> 01:36:44,981
No fishing boat's gonna catch a yacht,
especially at that price.

1278
01:36:45,106 --> 01:36:49,527
- Maybe she'll decide to come back.
- Dumbo, she's on her way to New York!

1279
01:36:49,652 --> 01:36:53,198
- This is a job for Dr Death.
- Yeah, Dr Death could do it!

1280
01:36:53,323 --> 01:36:55,366
We gotta do somethin'. Right, Dad?

1281
01:36:55,492 --> 01:36:57,202
Wrong!

1282
01:36:57,327 --> 01:36:59,370
Now, she's gone, guys.

1283
01:36:59,496 --> 01:37:01,164
She hates me!

1284
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:06,795
She's got her rich husband back...
and her rich life and that's the end of it.

1285
01:37:29,984 --> 01:37:32,779
I love the sound of the ocean.

1286
01:37:33,822 --> 01:37:36,699
Hallo-ooo!

1287
01:37:40,286 --> 01:37:41,955
Tofutti.

1288
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,833
Ah, Tofutti, where are you
when I need you?

1289
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:49,879
Tofutti Klein-ein-ein-ein...

1290
01:37:50,004 --> 01:37:52,048
All together. And!

1291
01:37:52,215 --> 01:37:55,009
Lick, shake, lick.

1292
01:37:55,468 --> 01:37:56,636
Drink!

1293
01:37:58,054 --> 01:38:00,265
Suck!

1294
01:38:01,808 --> 01:38:04,894
- You sucked first!
- No, I didn't! I did it right!

1295
01:38:05,937 --> 01:38:08,231
- Danger watch! Gotta go! Let's go!
- Oh, yes.

1296
01:38:09,107 --> 01:38:10,692
Croissants in the morning!

1297
01:38:10,817 --> 01:38:14,279
- Dinner was wonderful.
- <i>Merci beaucoup. Bonne nuit</i>.

1298
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:17,115
You best not lose these again, madam.

1299
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,659
- Again?
- With my apologies, madam.

1300
01:38:19,784 --> 01:38:23,747
"Andrew! I seem to have lost
my ruby earrings somewhere between...

1301
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:27,959
<i>6</i> 4th... and <i>6</i> 8th Streets."

1302
01:38:28,084 --> 01:38:29,878
"Find them!"

1303
01:38:30,962 --> 01:38:35,675
I've behaved so badly. I don't know
how you put up with me for so long.

1304
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,262
You've done so many
wonderful things for me

1305
01:38:39,387 --> 01:38:41,848
and I've never even once said thank you.

1306
01:38:43,349 --> 01:38:45,393
I'm sorry.

1307
01:38:47,979 --> 01:38:50,023
Apology accepted, ma'am.

1308
01:38:51,357 --> 01:38:54,527
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think they're right?

1309
01:38:54,986 --> 01:38:57,238
Oh, no, madam. Oh, no.

1310
01:38:58,281 --> 01:39:02,077
Most of us... go through life
with blinders on, madam,

1311
01:39:03,787 --> 01:39:07,040
knowing only that one little station
to which we were born.

1312
01:39:07,165 --> 01:39:10,710
But you, madam, on the other hand,
have had the rare privilege

1313
01:39:10,835 --> 01:39:14,172
of escaping your bonds for just a spell

1314
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:18,426
to see life from an entirely
new perspective.

1315
01:39:19,636 --> 01:39:24,808
How you choose to use that information,
madam, is entirely up to you.

1316
01:39:45,078 --> 01:39:47,372
- Captain Karl?
- Yes, ma'am.

1317
01:39:47,497 --> 01:39:50,375
- We've never really had time to talk.
- No, we haven't.

1318
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,544
Well, there's no time now.

1319
01:39:53,336 --> 01:39:55,839
- What are you doing?
- Turning the boat around.

1320
01:39:55,964 --> 01:39:58,842
- Why?
- I'm going home.

1321
01:39:58,967 --> 01:40:01,720
You're turning that wheel too fast.

1322
01:40:23,324 --> 01:40:27,078
Captain Karl! Why is the land
on the wrong side of the yacht?

1323
01:40:29,539 --> 01:40:33,084
Oh, she did?
Well, she's gone too far this time.

1324
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:35,503
She thinks she's dealing with an idiot!

1325
01:40:40,425 --> 01:40:42,886
So we're heading back
to the jungles of Oregon!

1326
01:40:43,011 --> 01:40:45,305
- I want to go back, Grant.
- To him?

1327
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:47,474
Yes. I'm sorry.

1328
01:40:48,892 --> 01:40:52,270
You haven't begun to be sorry,
you hillbilly harlot!

1329
01:40:52,896 --> 01:40:56,066
Captain Karl, go below with the crew.
I'm taking over.

1330
01:40:56,191 --> 01:40:58,234
Andrew, go get Dr Korman! Go!

1331
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:00,528
- Get out of my way, Karl!
- But, sir!

1332
01:41:00,653 --> 01:41:02,655
Now I'm in charge!

1333
01:41:02,781 --> 01:41:06,618
We're coming about... at full speed ahead!

1334
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:26,054
- Who is it?
- Dr Death. Let's go.

1335
01:41:26,179 --> 01:41:28,223
We're gonna go get her!

1336
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:30,725
Come on! Billy's friends'll help us!

1337
01:41:39,943 --> 01:41:42,904
- I hope I don't get court-martialled.
- Yeah, I owe you.

1338
01:41:43,488 --> 01:41:47,033
- Anything in the manual?
- Not about pulling alongside a ship

1339
01:41:47,158 --> 01:41:49,536
and telling a passenger
you love them, sir.

1340
01:41:49,661 --> 01:41:52,664
Put your nose in the manual
and find something, Lucas!

1341
01:41:53,248 --> 01:41:55,792
Whatever you do,
I'm getting off at the next port.

1342
01:41:55,917 --> 01:41:58,670
Don't be ridiculous.
<i>Nobody</i> leaves a Stayton.

1343
01:41:58,795 --> 01:42:01,965
I don't love you any more.
Please try and understand that.

1344
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:04,134
What has love got to do with marriage?

1345
01:42:06,261 --> 01:42:09,681
You'd actually prefer living in squalor
with that cave dweller!

1346
01:42:12,934 --> 01:42:15,729
They should have kept you
in the hospital psycho ward!

1347
01:42:17,689 --> 01:42:19,941
What did you say?

1348
01:42:20,066 --> 01:42:22,402
How did you know that?

1349
01:42:22,902 --> 01:42:24,946
You left me there, didn't you?

1350
01:42:27,282 --> 01:42:29,409
You snake!

1351
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:32,704
How could you do that?

1352
01:42:32,829 --> 01:42:36,082
How could you be such a slime?

1353
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:40,295
Call me all the names you want,
but many women adore me!

1354
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,964
Do you wanna know what I was doing?
I'll tell you.

1355
01:42:43,089 --> 01:42:46,426
I was whacking the donkey
with painted ladies. They loved me!

1356
01:42:46,926 --> 01:42:49,345
Yes! I did leave you.

1357
01:42:49,471 --> 01:42:52,724
There! Now I've confessed. So what?

1358
01:42:52,849 --> 01:42:56,102
We're at sea. And I'm a god at sea!

1359
01:43:00,106 --> 01:43:03,026
Nine o'clock in the morning.
This better be good.

1360
01:43:03,151 --> 01:43:05,904
Doctor, Grant's having
another nervous breakdown.

1361
01:43:06,029 --> 01:43:09,491
- He thinks he's God. Keep him busy.
- All right.

1362
01:43:09,616 --> 01:43:12,118
- Morning, Grant.
- Korman, my wife is insane.

1363
01:43:12,243 --> 01:43:14,871
- Do we have a straitjacket?
- I always carry one.

1364
01:43:14,996 --> 01:43:16,748
Good! Put her in it!

1365
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:22,128
You're overwrought, Grant.
I want you to take a Valium.

1366
01:43:22,253 --> 01:43:24,422
Here, take one of mine.

1367
01:43:25,298 --> 01:43:27,592
- Is Nino here?
- Nino on break.

1368
01:43:27,717 --> 01:43:30,720
I have to stop the boat.
My husband's a little bit crazy...

1369
01:43:30,845 --> 01:43:33,223
- The captain stop the boat.
- I'm the captain!

1370
01:43:33,348 --> 01:43:36,434
No, please don't salute!
I have to find a red button...

1371
01:43:38,895 --> 01:43:40,939
Vessel sighted straight ahead, sir!

1372
01:43:41,064 --> 01:43:44,401
- Identify.
- There's a fat guy in my way, sir.

1373
01:43:44,526 --> 01:43:47,737
Who you callin' fat, you little weasel!
Come here!

1374
01:43:49,406 --> 01:43:51,699
Where's the thing? I need the red...

1375
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:54,577
- Here! Here it is!
- No, please!

1376
01:43:57,747 --> 01:43:59,791
- The boat stopped.
- Yes, it stopped!

1377
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:03,294
- I need to get it turned around.
- Nino on the break.

1378
01:44:11,636 --> 01:44:13,680
He's here!

1379
01:44:14,139 --> 01:44:17,559
He's here! That's him!

1380
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:25,692
Stop that boat immediately
and let me get my mom!

1381
01:44:26,818 --> 01:44:28,737
- <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>
- Pee Wee Herman.

1382
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:33,283
<i>- Qui est-ce?
- Maman! Qu'est-ce qu'on mange ce soir?</i>

1383
01:44:33,408 --> 01:44:35,910
<i>Come in, Immaculata</i>.

1384
01:44:36,327 --> 01:44:39,330
- He's here!
- There's mutiny afoot.

1385
01:44:45,503 --> 01:44:49,758
She's at the bottom of this mutiny.
I'm gonna rid myself of this albatross.

1386
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:01,102
He's here!

1387
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:11,321
- Go back to New York, Dr Korman.
- Really? Thank you.

1388
01:45:11,446 --> 01:45:13,490
- Dean!
- Madam! The ship has stopped.

1389
01:45:13,615 --> 01:45:15,658
What happened? Did he strike you?

1390
01:45:15,784 --> 01:45:19,037
- Did he make you do something?
- No! Everything's wonderful.

1391
01:45:19,162 --> 01:45:23,041
- Message over the radio, sir.
- Annie! Ha-ha!

1392
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:26,795
Looks like the fun's over. We've got some
salmon poachers fishing in illegal waters.

1393
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,953
That takes precedence
over your friend's love life.

1394
01:45:29,053 --> 01:45:31,424
- Come about!
- Son, no more radio.

1395
01:45:31,549 --> 01:45:34,594
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a... Hey!

1396
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:37,263
- Billy, what's goin' on?
- We're turnin' round.

1397
01:45:37,389 --> 01:45:39,391
They're going after salmon poachers.

1398
01:45:39,516 --> 01:45:43,895
He's leaving. Where's he going?

1399
01:45:56,241 --> 01:45:59,828
- Catarina!
- Arturo!

1400
01:46:06,543 --> 01:46:08,420
I'm coming!

1401
01:46:08,545 --> 01:46:12,716
- Man overboard!
- Shit! Sound the horn.

1402
01:46:12,841 --> 01:46:16,177
Coming about again, Czapowskyj.

1403
01:46:16,302 --> 01:46:18,888
Annie!

1404
01:46:19,013 --> 01:46:21,349
Oh, no, madam. I cannot let you do this!

1405
01:46:21,474 --> 01:46:24,144
- What?
- Not without a lifejacket.

1406
01:46:24,853 --> 01:46:27,105
Dean! I'm coming!

1407
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:30,567
Madam, you really should
play a little hard to get.

1408
01:46:30,692 --> 01:46:32,944
Tell my mother I'll call her!

1409
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:39,242
Woman overboard!
She's wearing an evening dress, sir.

1410
01:46:39,367 --> 01:46:42,162
Get those kids out of the rescue boat.
Let's go!

1411
01:46:42,287 --> 01:46:44,789
My mom's out there! Let me...

1412
01:46:44,914 --> 01:46:47,041
Halt! You treasonous tramp!

1413
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:50,086
Conspiring with the enemy
at sea is mutiny!

1414
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:52,338
Pull!

1415
01:46:56,634 --> 01:46:58,678
<i>Another man overboard!</i>

1416
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:01,181
I am giving my notice, sir!

1417
01:47:11,566 --> 01:47:15,445
- Annie!
- Oh, Dean!

1418
01:47:20,533 --> 01:47:22,160
Annie!

1419
01:47:40,136 --> 01:47:43,098
I love you! I'll never leave you again!

1420
01:47:43,223 --> 01:47:46,476
I'll never let you go!
You're my Annie. You always will be.

1421
01:47:47,143 --> 01:47:49,729
Man overboard
is kissing woman overboard.

1422
01:47:50,563 --> 01:47:52,816
Our rescue boat is starboard.

1423
01:47:53,358 --> 01:47:56,653
The guy with the arrows
is being pulled in at port.

1424
01:47:56,778 --> 01:47:59,406
It's a helluva day at sea, sir.

1425
01:48:01,449 --> 01:48:05,578
- I can't believe you did it.
- Oh, I saw you jump so I jumped.

1426
01:48:05,703 --> 01:48:07,747
No, I don't mean that.

1427
01:48:07,872 --> 01:48:10,417
I can't believe
you gave all that up just for me.

1428
01:48:10,542 --> 01:48:12,877
- I didn't.
- What do... What do you mean?

1429
01:48:13,002 --> 01:48:15,046
Well, the truth is that it's mine.

1430
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:17,882
The boat, the money, everything.
It's all mine.

1431
01:48:18,007 --> 01:48:20,885
Dean! Dean, it's OK!

1432
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,064
Oh! Did you tell 'em?

1433
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:35,066
Yeah.

1434
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:38,445
- They're making out their Christmas lists.
- Oh, already?

1435
01:48:39,154 --> 01:48:41,281
How do you spell Porsche?

1436
01:48:43,491 --> 01:48:45,535
They got me thinking, though.

1437
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:50,206
What can I possibly give you, ever,
that you don't already have?

1438
01:48:57,505 --> 01:48:59,549
A little girl.
