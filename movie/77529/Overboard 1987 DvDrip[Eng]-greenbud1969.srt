Dock five, the <i>Immaculata?</i>

2
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:04,485
It's over there!

3
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,653
Oh!

4
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,746
I cannot, I repeat, cannot

5
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,875
sit in this cesspool by the sea
with nothing to do.

6
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,463
So, while you repair your silly boat
engines, I will do some remodelling.

7
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:28,717
- I've sent for a carpenter.
- Whatever, diddums. I'm shooting skeet.

8
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:33,013
Hello!

9
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:38,602
Mr Stayton? Anybody home?

10
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:41,855
- Hello!
- State your purpose!

11
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,359
- Nice-looking Wetherby you got.
- It's a very expensive gun.

12
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:48,695
- I have lots and lots of them.
- Somebody call for a carpenter?

13
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,489
That's my wife's department.

14
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:53,200
Could you tell me
where your wife might... be?

15
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:02,084
You're the carpenter?

16
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,879
Yeah. Dean Proffitt.

17
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,048
You're late.

18
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,677
- References?
- Well, no, not really.

19
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:14,179
You see, I just moved up to this area...

20
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,850
Hey, I've been doing this kind
of shit - work - for years.

21
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:20,853
This is... This is just beautiful. Wow!

22
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,898
- Try not to touch anything.
- Oh, I won't.

23
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,193
Andrew will keep an eye on you.

24
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:32,448
Maybe you'd like to take fingerprints
before I get started.

25
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,616
I was just... kidding.

26
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,747
Don't walk so close to me!

27
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:42,708
OK! Where's your problem?

28
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,626
- My closet.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,754
In here.

30
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,467
Now, you can see
how inadequate this all is.

31
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,344
I need new shoe racks for my shoes.

32
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,056
Uh, excuse me. I was told that
this was some kind of an emergency.

33
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,476
It is.

34
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,770
And I need drawers for my lingerie.

35
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,982
I can't keep entering
these boxes all the time.

36
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:11,737
Hello?

37
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:17,659
Uh... Hey, I'm sorry. I understand now.
You want me to remodel your closet.

38
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:23,290
Isn't that what I've been explaining
in some detail?

39
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:25,542
Is English your second language?

40
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,713
What is that odour?

41
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,009
I don't smell anything.

42
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:36,261
Madam.

43
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:40,140
Well! I almost had to wait.

44
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:46,021
I got an idea for a shoe rack
right in here maybe, huh?

45
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:52,069
What <i>is</i> this gelatinous muck?!

46
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,948
Andrew, when I tell you to pack staples,

47
00:05:56,073 --> 00:06:01,703
must I specify that you are to pack
good caviar and not this $1.99 fish bait!

48
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:05,541
- Yes, madam.
- Caviar should be round and hard

49
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,918
and of adequate size.

50
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:12,464
And it should burst in your mouth
at <i>precisely</i> the right moment.

51
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:15,843
Yes, madam.

52
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:17,845
- Carpenter!
- Yeah?

53
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,348
You have exactly 48 hours.
I suggest you get started.

54
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:26,145
- Throw that out.
- Yes, madam.

55
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,274
Watch him.

56
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:37,281
<i>Mais oui! Bien sur!</i>

57
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:39,616
<i>Oui?</i>

58
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,202
<i>Ecoutez, Jean-Jacques</i>.
<i>Je vous telephone</i>...

59
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:45,122
Oh, boy. She is really something!

60
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,292
I know it will cost me,
but it's the cutest little painting.

61
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:51,545
I simply must have it.
You'll do the bidding for me?

62
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,255
But of course(!)

63
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,425
- Bid 1,700,000.
- Shit!

64
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:00,012
Grant, I'm on the phone!

65
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:03,307
I can't hear you, tea rose!
I'm shooting skeet!

66
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,058
- Pull!
- Pull!

67
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:06,852
Firing!

68
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,993
Hello.

69
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:48,727
Forks were invented so man
could at least make a pretence

70
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:52,773
- of separating himself from the apes.
- So were thumbs.

71
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:58,195
- What did you say?
- Nothin'. Just... my stomach.

72
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:02,449
Well, try to control your bodily noises
so I can hear myself think!

73
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,791
<i>And another</i>
<i>Oregon good morning to you</i>.

74
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,293
<i>Wilbur Budd here with some local items</i>.

75
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:17,923
<i>The Fraga Feed and Fertilizer folks</i>
<i>are hiring people to shovel the stuff</i>.

76
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:22,678
<i>Oh, women are welcome, too. There's</i>
<i>no chauvinism in the manure business</i>.

77
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:26,598
These gnats keep landing
on my wet nail polish.

78
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:30,894
I guess I'm supposed to walk around with
their little corpses stuck to my fingers.

79
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,313
- Joanna, please!
- It's easy for you to say!

80
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:37,484
You don't have to sit out here in the brine
with your perm frizzing to oblivion.

81
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,570
I look like a bushman.

82
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:42,906
Why don't you go inside
and get out of the sea air?

83
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:47,453
Because that Elk Snout mountain man
is still working on my closet.

84
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,621
He's sweating all over the place.

85
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,790
I doubt if he's even housebroken.

86
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:54,960
- Oh, I think they housebreak each other...
- Ssh!

87
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,546
- What?
- He's listening.

88
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,757
- Who?
- That carpenter.

89
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:03,093
He's been hanging on our every word
for the last two days.

90
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:06,180
It's your project, Joanna. You deal with it.

91
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:10,684
- Come along, men.
- The engines are ready, sir.

92
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,853
Well, let's get going.

93
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,523
I've finished, madam.
Shall I put your jewellery back on you?

94
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:17,733
No.

95
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,444
I'm still tacky.

96
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:37,961
Keep quiet for ten more minutes, collect
the money and get the hell outta here.

97
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:40,380
Well! Are we amusing you?

98
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:45,052
- What... is this?
- Uh, well, I'm done. I'm finished.

99
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:47,554
- Uh... What do you think?
- What is it?

100
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,933
Well, it's a shoe rack... with a twist.
Uh... You ready?

101
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:56,021
Just turn the crank here, those drop back,
these split. Gives you twice the space...

102
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:59,191
Stop boring me with your absurdities.
What's it made of?

103
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:01,360
It's called wood. It's oak.

104
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,862
Oak. An oak closet?

105
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,948
Huh! Why am I even amazed?

106
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,367
I don't know. Why are you amazed?

107
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:13,497
One would think you would know closets
are made of cedar. If not, we get moths.

108
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:17,501
Well, lady, there's not a real big
moth problem off the Pacific coast.

109
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:21,046
But if you want one out of cedar,
that's fine. I'll start all over.

110
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:24,925
I just have to tell ya that's gonna
more than double my estimate.

111
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,847
- What do you mean?
- I've already done this out of oak, so...

112
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:34,184
- I'm not paying for your mistake!
- I'm not just gonna eat it on this deal.

113
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,603
Why not?
You've eaten everything else here.

114
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:38,897
And you will eat it
because I wanted cedar!

115
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:41,775
You may have <i>wanted</i> cedar,
but you didn't <i>ask</i> for it.

116
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,862
The entire civilised world
knows closets are made of cedar!

117
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:48,282
In Elk Snout,
we don't know about them closets!

118
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:52,578
Nor bathrooms, neither! Shit, woman!
You're lucky I <i>am</i> housebroke!

119
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:56,582
- You were listening.
- Well, it was kinda hard to avoid.

120
00:10:56,707 --> 00:11:00,169
- You can avoid it now - you're fired!
- You're unbelievable!

121
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:04,006
That's fine with me!
Just pay me the money you owe me.

122
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:08,969
- The job was not done to my satisfaction!
- I got news for you, lady!

123
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,597
No job will ever be done
to your satisfaction!

124
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:13,766
That's quite enough! Now, just get out!

125
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,685
No problem! Pay me the <i>6</i>00 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone!

126
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,854
Captain Karl! Start up the engine!

127
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,859
You know what your problem is? Huh?

128
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:27,362
You're so goddamn bored,
you gotta invent things to bitch about.

129
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:30,532
You haven't got a single thing to do
except for your hair.

130
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,493
Yeah! The closet was fine!

131
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:35,788
You just needed somethin'
to take up your useless, empty,

132
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:40,334
nail-polishing, toe-polishing,
rich-bitch, sun tanning days!

133
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,715
- Don't touch me!
- What?

134
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:49,927
Hey, lady.

135
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:55,140
I may be hard up, but I am not that
hard up. And I'm not goin' anywhere...

136
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,851
Hey!

137
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:01,605
- Damn you!
- Man overboard!

138
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,774
I'll get you for this, you...

139
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,486
Not my tool belt! You owe me <i>6</i>00 bucks!

140
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,739
- Keep going!
- As you wish.

141
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,702
If I ever get you, lady, you're dead meat!
You got that?

142
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,871
No, don't throw that!

143
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,876
I'm not bored! I'm quite happy!

144
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:25,045
Everyone wants to be me!

145
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,590
You come back here!

146
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,802
I lost all my tools.

147
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:35,055
I'll loan you some tools.
We'll get you some part-time work.

148
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,100
I need a steady job.
What about that night-time thing?

149
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:42,521
I'm working on it. Listen, pretty soon,
we'll get that miniature golf course deal.

150
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,690
If I can hang on that long.

151
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:50,028
He called you a what?

152
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:54,450
Joanna, why are you so upset?

153
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:59,580
Why in the world do you care what some
carpenter from Elk Snout thinks of you?

154
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:02,166
I'm sure I'm just premenstrual.

155
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,420
Then you must go right back to bed
for at least two days.

156
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,674
Inga, you don't shove the food
down Shiitake's throat.

157
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,928
You place it on her tongue.
Don't they have dogs in Sweden?

158
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:17,431
Grant mentioned having a baby again.

159
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,434
<i>What should I do?</i>

160
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,062
<i>Darling, if you have a baby,</i>

161
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:26,231
you won't be the baby any more.

162
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:28,358
True.

163
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:31,528
<i>Well, I must go. Bye-bye, Mommy</i>.

164
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,322
Bye-bye, sweetie.

165
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,241
I'm not a bitch.

166
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,874
Andrew!
Are you going to bring me my lemon

167
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,794
or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

168
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,343
Hey, guys, I'm home!

169
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:59,807
Stay away, you wolves! No! Shoo!

170
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:01,975
Bad dogs! Go away!

171
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:05,270
Buster! Jackson! Get back inside!

172
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,899
- Are you Mr Proffitt?
- Yeah!

173
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:12,778
You look like the morning after
Halloween. Probably had a day like I did.

174
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:16,323
- What happened to you?
- Monday is their first day of school

175
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:20,911
and I came here to welcome your family.
And what do I get in return?

176
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:24,790
- I get toilet-papered by your children!
- They're just playin' around!

177
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:29,461
Just playin' around? They were about
to douse the toilet paper with gasoline

178
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,630
- and strike...
- Wait, wait! Stop.

179
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,007
- Greg and Charlie. Twins, right?
- Yeah.

180
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:38,429
They're having this arson period. They
don't know this, but I'm ahead of them.

181
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:40,889
I got two fire extinguishers ready to go.

182
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,475
- I didn't catch your name.
- Adele Burbridge.

183
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,894
- Nice to meet you.
- Principal of the Elk Cove school.

184
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,023
- Your children are monsters!
- You won't think that once you know 'em!

185
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,945
- Where is Mrs Proffitt during all of this?
- She died three years ago.

186
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:02,327
Mr Proffitt, your children are totally
lacking in parental supervision.

187
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:05,664
Hey, you don't have to tell <i>me</i>
these kids are lucky.

188
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:09,293
Fine. You can joke all you want,
but I am serious about this.

189
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:14,339
If you don't do something,
I am going to notify the proper authorities.

190
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:17,801
I have had baby-sitters in here
by the dozen, but...

191
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,970
I'm... I'm kinda low on cash right now.

192
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:24,308
I'm new in town, but if I get a chance
I'll hire a housekeeper, all right?

193
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,436
I'll believe it when I see it.
Good day, Mr Proffitt!

194
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:31,315
I'm a good father!

195
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,735
Ah, what do you know?

196
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:51,043
Joanna, I want you tonight.

197
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,962
How can you have your period
every week?!

198
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:59,093
<i>You can stow away with the rich</i>
<i>and famous to exotic ports of call</i>...

199
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,678
Must you watch that thing incessantly?

200
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:06,475
Yes, I must. It has a tawdry escapist
quality that soothes my nerves.

201
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,145
What you have to escape from,
I can't possibly imagine.

202
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:14,233
Grant! I left my wedding ring on the deck.

203
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,861
- Well, what can <i>I</i> do?
- Go and get it.

204
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:21,573
- It's after midnight!
- I don't care what time it is. I want it now!

205
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:24,952
I want to see who's in the top ten yachts.

206
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,621
- I'll get it!
- OK.

207
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:32,292
<i>A countdown to the world's</i>
<i>ten best luxury yachts</i>.

208
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,462
<i>This is the big league of the seven seas</i>.

209
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:40,592
<i>The one purchase that separates</i>
<i>mere millionaires from multimillionaires</i>.

210
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,512

00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:48,183
<i>a 167-foot Saudi-owned dreamboat,</i>
<i>docked in Tahiti</i>.

212
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,352
<i>Number nine, the 230</i>...

213
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,538
Andrew!

214
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,378
Grant!

215
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:23,802
Oh, my hair!

216
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,304
Help!

217
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:30,559
Grant! Help!

218
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:35,355
Stop! You idiots!

219
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:42,654
Another Oregon good morning to you!
This is Wilbur Budd here at KRAB,

220
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,658
the family station,
run by me and my family.

221
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:50,829
Sorry to interrupt the movie, but we got
some excitement in Tillamook County.

222
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:54,750
I've got a bulletin for the eyewitness,
on-the-spot KRAB newsroom.

223
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,086
It seems a mystery woman
was picked up

224
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:00,380
by the Elk Cove garbage scow
shortly after midnight.

225
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:03,383
They fished her out of the water
and she's conscious,

226
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,637
but the problem is she seems
to be suffering from amnesia.

227
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,264
She has no recollection of who she is.

228
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,309
<i>My wife Rose is with</i>
<i>the captain of the garbage scow</i>

229
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,353
<i>that picked up the mystery lady</i>.

230
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:16,396
- <i>Rose?</i>
- Mr Tunatti.

231
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:20,651
Can you tell us what the woman was like
when you brought her aboard?

232
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:25,364
Yes. We saw something float in water
like this. Just like that, just like that.

233
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:28,784
We didn't know it... We bring... on board.

234
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,662
- On board.
- Yes. We say... <i>foca!</i>

235
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:34,081
Excuse me,
you can't say that on television!

236
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,041
No, no, no, no!

237
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,836
<i>Foca! Foca!</i>
<i>Foca</i> means seal in <i>portugues!</i>

238
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,213
- Oh, I see!
- Seal, seal! So we bring...

239
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:44,758
- You learn something every day!
- No clothes. Just a little thing.

240
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:49,263
- <i>There you have it. Thank you, Tunatti</i>.
- <i>Thank you</i>.

241
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:51,432
<i>Garbage I do for money. For love, I sing</i>.

242
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:54,059
- <i>In my country, I sing</i>.
- <i>Isn't that interesting?</i>

243
00:18:56,186 --> 00:19:01,150
- <i>We have a Renaissance garbageman</i>.
- <i>We tell stories with our songs</i>.

244
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,110
<i>Thank you, Rose</i>.

245
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:06,447
<i>Arnie, can we roll that tape now, please?</i>

246
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,201
<i>Now, folks. Here's an interview</i>
<i>we taped earlier at the hospital</i>.

247
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:14,246
<i>Miss, miss</i>... <i>do you know your name?</i>

248
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,415
<i>Of course I know my name!</i>

249
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,042
<i>It's</i>...

250
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:21,211
<i>Oh! This is absurd!</i>

251
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,964
<i>I know it! It</i>...

252
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,592
<i>Get that thing out of my face!</i>

253
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:29,928
<i>What a horrible wig!</i>

254
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:44,651
You mean to tell me
that I have no medical recourse?

255
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,030
- Can she see us?
- Not unless she's Superwoman.

256
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:53,243
Well, what do you know? Extend
your brain a teensy little bit, if possible!

257
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:56,914
You seem to be suffering
from a temporary amnesia,

258
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,251
either from the bump into the garbage
scow or the shock of the cold water.

259
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:03,962
- How temporary is it?
- Well, we don't know.

260
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,174
Otherwise, you seem to be
in excellent physical shape.

261
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,343
Listen to me, medical people.

262
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:13,764
As of now, I have a life history
of a dirty garbage scow

263
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,392
and a breakfast of
extremely runny eggs over easy!

264
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,813
Now I refuse... refuse...

265
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,067
to be incarcerated in this
semi-private room!

266
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,069
You snore!

267
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,780
No efforts are being made
for anyone to locate...

268
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:30,948
Is that her?

269
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:35,077
<i>I demand you do something!</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

270
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,663
No! I never saw her before in my life.

271
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:43,377
Mrs Stayton has decided
to leave me. Let's celebrate!

272
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:49,758
Now, Miss, uh... X, we have
a comfortable private room for you

273
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:54,680
where you'll be safer, we'll all be safer,
and you'll be a lot more comfortable.

274
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:58,267
Well, I'm glad you've <i>finally</i>
come to your senses!

275
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,394
I was prepared to sue you.

276
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,605
I don't know who I am,
but I'm sure I have a lawyer.

277
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:17,202
- Hey, you about done?
- Yeah! I think I got it fixed.

278
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:20,330
- Your lunch is on the counter.
- Thanks.

279
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,833
<i>Hi, this is Wilbur Budd</i>.
<i>We got some more</i>

280
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,211
<i>on that amnesia lady story</i>
<i>down there in Elk Grove</i>.

281
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:28,380
<i>Wanna push in on these, Barry, please?</i>

282
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:32,009
Uh, I saw some potato chips
around the corner. Could I just...?

283
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,178
OK, one bag!

284
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:39,516
<i>I said Elk Grove before. You know</i>
<i>I meant Elk Cove. Anything new, honey?</i>

285
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:43,604
<i>The mystery woman is still suffering</i>
<i>from complete but temporary amnesia</i>.

286
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:48,400
<i>If you know the identity of this</i>
<i>woman, please contact Elk Cove Hospital</i>.

287
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,653
<i>I'll put up the reward myself</i>.
<i>She's drivin' us crazy</i>.

288
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,906
- <i>Thank you. Back to Wilbur</i>...
- Yo, Dean!

289
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:59,995
- <i>She's not the nicest person around</i>...
- Look at this!

290
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,749
<i>She made some remarks about</i>
<i>Rose's hair, which I didn't care for</i>.

291
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:06,919
<i>In any event, there she is</i>
<i>and this is what she looks like</i>.

292
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:08,629
- That's her.
- Who?

293
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,589
The bitch!

294
00:22:10,714 --> 00:22:15,511
<i>Earlier today, one man arrived on</i>
<i>the scene to make an identification, but</i>...

295
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:18,680
I can't believe it. He's skippin' out on her.

296
00:22:18,806 --> 00:22:21,558
Course he is! It's his shot at freedom.

297
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:24,228
We should go and see
if we can get your money back.

298
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:26,396
- Look, he's gone!
- Not him, her!

299
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:32,361
She doesn't know who she is. Do you
think she's gonna know who I am?

300
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:41,620
- Billy, there is a God and he loves me.
- You're not gonna shave your head?

301
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:43,038
No.

302
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:45,707
- Dean...
- I gotta go talk to my kids.

303
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,502
I want you to take 'em shopping
at the Salvation Army.

304
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,879
This is illegal! Dean, you're crazy!

305
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,969
I wondered if a woman like that
had a husband.

306
00:22:57,094 --> 00:23:00,764
- Oh, yeah! She does!
- Here's some effects you may recognise.

307
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:01,974
Oh, yeah.

308
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,811
Nice panties. Some initials here,
she didn't know what they meant. JS.

309
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:09,690
She wouldn't cos, see,
I bought these for her at a garage sale.

310
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:13,026
- I bought my wife a garter at a yard sale.
- I bet you did.

311
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,155
- Hey, what else you got in here?
- I got some pictures.

312
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,740
We were gonna wire them,
but now you're here...

313
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:21,118
Yeah! That's her.

314
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,164
Oh, yeah. That's my little cookie-cutter.

315
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:27,624
- Quite a beauty!
- She's somethin', isn't she?

316
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,127
You got that right!

317
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:32,212
Doc. We got a winner.

318
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:53,942
Annie!

319
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,154
Stop!

320
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,324
I don't recognise this man.

321
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:03,118
Your wife's had an almost
total loss of memory.

322
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,997
I-I can't believe
she doesn't know her own husband!

323
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,460
This missing-link person
is not my husband!

324
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:13,962
Oh, Annie, please!

325
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:17,174
- Annie. Annie.
- Right.

326
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:19,259
That's not right. That's not my name!

327
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:22,679
This is completely crazy! Honey, sit down.

328
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:27,184
Everything's gonna be OK.
Now... I <i>am</i> your husband.

329
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:29,353
My name is Dean Proffitt.

330
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,689
We've been married for 13 years.

331
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,441
Wait!

332
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:38,070
I admit I have forgotten numerous things.

333
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:42,032
But I truly, from the depths of my soul,
do not remember you!

334
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:45,035
Don't you think
there'd be some spark of recognition?

335
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,455
- We don't know.
- Maybe you'll spark to this!

336
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:58,674
Ugh! I don't believe this!
He could be some stranger off the street!

337
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,176
Well, he seems to like you
and he's a nice guy.

338
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:02,886
- He's good-lookin'.
- Clean.

339
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,722
- What's my full name?
- Oh, come on!

340
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:08,308
- What is it?
- Mrs Annie Proffitt!

341
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:12,146
- What's my maiden name?
- Annie... Goolihy.

342
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:15,190
Annie Goolihy?

343
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,651
Where in God's name did I grow up?
Dogpatch?

344
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:22,906
No, no, not there! Over in Goober, Idaho.
But it's a nuclear waste dump now...

345
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,534
- Where did I meet you?
- Hank's Donut World.

346
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:29,163
Seattle? You hung out there every night
when you were in the Navy!

347
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,623
- You remember...
- I was in the armed forces?

348
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:34,209
I've still got your postcards
from Okinawa...

349
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:37,004
Stop. The Navy?

350
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:38,630
Oh, come on, honey!

351
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:40,924
You gotta know! You were in the Navy!

352
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:44,887
No, I don't know! I don't know
any of this and I don't know you!

353
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,056
I need some proof!

354
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:50,976
Stop staring at me!

355
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,729
Eat your chequers!

356
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:59,109
Look, if it were up to us, we'd be glad
to give her to you, but she's right.

357
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:01,236
I'm gonna need some verification.

358
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:04,782
Oh, listen... I know what you mean.
I understand. Now...

359
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:09,870
I don't like to talk about this in public,
and I've never told anybody...

360
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:15,417
She does have a small
strawberry-like birthmark, uh...

361
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,920
It's kinda high up on her... left cheek

362
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,923
and it's unique.

363
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:42,694
Come to Daddy!

364
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,046
Mister!
What was I doing out in the ocean?

365
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:07,428
Um... That's something you like to do.
You know, divin' for oysters at night.

366
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:10,973
Sometimes you get pretty far
from the shore and that undertow...

367
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:15,394
Oysters? In a cold ocean at night?
That doesn't sound like me.

368
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,985
I just... ate a bug!

369
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:30,492
Keep your mouth closed!
A lot of things flying around out here.

370
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:53,307
Welcome home, baby!

371
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:56,101
I feel faint.

372
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:01,440
Come on, Buster! Come on, Jackson!

373
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:04,818
No. This is wrong.

374
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:08,030
Come along, now.
We've only been here a couple of weeks.

375
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:13,410
A lot of stuff's in boxes from the move,
so I hardly recognise the place myself.

376
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:16,622
We moved here... deliberately?

377
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,586
Our last place was a real dump.

378
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:26,548
Come on.

379
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:32,054
Our new palace!

380
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,146
Well!

381
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:45,275
Let me, uh... Let me show you around.
Maybe something'll come back to you.

382
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:50,447
- Did I just go downhill?
- Look at that. It's comin' back already.

383
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:53,283
Everything slants down here
toward the bedroom.

384
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:57,121
Dining room and toilet... Only one.

385
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:02,167
And here we are at the old,
uh... magic room.

386
00:29:03,168 --> 00:29:05,295
Put a lot of miles on that mattress, huh?

387
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:07,756
Later.

388
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:11,218
All right! Here's where we have
breakfast every morning.

389
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:13,303
Let's go up...

390
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:15,389
Oh-ho! Here they come!

391
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:22,938
- Charlie tried to kill my turtle!
- He didn't. It slipped out of his hands!

392
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:25,524
- He did!
- Hey, hey, guys! Whoa!

393
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:28,152
Whoa! Hey, look who's home!

394
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:31,071
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

395
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:34,408
Gee, Mom! We really missed you.

396
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:37,578
We're so glad you're back.

397
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:41,457
They're... They're not mine.

398
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:45,043
Oh, honey!
I was sure you'd remember them!

399
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,547
Well, I think I'd remember if I had three...

400
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,133
<i>Four,</i> honey! Don't forget little Joe.

401
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:57,347
Well, that's about it except for...

402
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:05,939
Hey, she's been in there an hour.
What did you guys get her?

403
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:08,108
- Dresses.
- The right sizes?

404
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,861
You didn't tell us.
You just said get some dresses.

405
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,363
OK, on the couch.
Come on, guys, don't blow it.

406
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:15,157
Hey, a dirty magazine!

407
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,951
Baby doll!

408
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:22,873
This garment cannot possibly
be a part of my wardrobe.

409
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:26,168
Let's forget for a moment that it's a rag,

410
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,754
but it happens to be 12 sizes too large.

411
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:32,508
- It's... It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

412
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:37,387
Well, come on, honey. You gotta
admit, you've lost a lot of weight.

413
00:30:37,513 --> 00:30:39,807
Huh? You used to be like a balloon!

414
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:44,770
- Was I also shorter?
- Yes!

415
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:49,691
Yes, you had a bad back. You walked
kinda hunched over, you know?

416
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:55,989
I was short <i>and</i> fat?

417
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:59,910
Look, I'm sure you've got
a million questions.

418
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:03,997
You've been through hell. So, let's
just take this thing one step at a time.

419
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,999
First, let's meet the boys.

420
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,504
In the middle we've got the twins - Greg
and Charlie. He likes to invent things.

421
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:13,924
- Twins?
- Yeah. Obviously, they're not identical.

422
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:17,386
- Or I'd look like a shithead!
- Who asked you, butthole?!

423
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:20,889
They came out fighting
and they're still at it!

424
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,474
Guys, guys!

425
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,687
Charlie and I get along very well, Mom.
My twin brother and I are best friends.

426
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:28,522
He's the actor in the family.

427
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:32,234
Then we got the big guy!
11 pounds 5 ounces.

428
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,279
Come on, honey, give it a try.
What's his name?

429
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:41,702
Roy?

430
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:48,375
No. Travis. Sweet Trav?

431
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,627
- Now, those are tits!
- My turn!

432
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:52,838
Hey, what are you...?

433
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:58,886
I was hopin' you'd recall this guy.
He's your newest, honey.

434
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:01,472
Hi, Mom! My name's Joe.

435
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:05,559
- A falsetto child?
- Ah, he thinks he's Pee Wee Herman.

436
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,936
I love Pee Wee Herman. Ha ha!

437
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,355
- Give your ma a kiss.
- No! No! No!

438
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:14,359
Do they have a problem
with their glands?

439
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:18,238
Hey, hey, guys, easy! Come on!

440
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:20,616
It's not us, Dad, it's Roy!

441
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,662
Ah, they're great boys, aren't they?

442
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:27,664
There's so many of them.

443
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,959
You've always had
your heart set on six, so...

444
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:33,128
we'll just keep on tryin'.

445
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:36,048
Dad! They're making me drink blood!

446
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,718
- Come back here!
- No, no, no!

447
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,679
They don't look anything like me!

448
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:46,850
They do take after your mother. Let's
hope they don't grow up to be lushes, too.

449
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,728
- My mother's a lush?
- Was, honey.

450
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:52,356
- Cirrhosis.
- She's...?

451
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,903
- What about my father?
- Oh, he's alive and well.

452
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:01,990
- And due for parole in, what, two years?
- Oh, God! I don't wanna hear any more!

453
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:04,493
- Look...
- I just wanna remember for myself.

454
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:08,497
The doctor says the best thing for you
is to get back to your normal routine.

455
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:12,668
You gotta get your memory back that
way. You gotta do what you normally do.

456
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:16,171
What is it I normally do?

457
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:19,967
I prepared and handled raw food?

458
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:24,221
I hunt it. You cook it.

459
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:27,099
- You shot a chicken?
- Come on, honey!

460
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:29,351
Save the jokes! We're starvin' here.

461
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,894
Yeah!

462
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,313
It's strange, but... ooh!

463
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,151
I feel as if I've never done this
before in my life.

464
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:41,363
Dad, are you and Uncle Billy really
gonna open a miniature golf course?

465
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:44,032
Nah. We'll just build it
when someone pays for it.

466
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:47,661
- What's miniature golf?
- For midget brains, like you.

467
00:33:47,786 --> 00:33:49,830
- I was only asking.
- You shut up!

468
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:01,341
You're gonna make that turtle sick again.

469
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:04,803
You gotta breathe on it.

470
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,891
Look at me, Dad!

471
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:14,438
Nothing's happening.

472
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:18,275
Well, pumpkin, you gotta light the burner.

473
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:24,531
30 seconds.

474
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:28,076
29... 28... 27...

475
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:34,291
Fire, fire!

476
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,211
Hey, come here. Sit down.

477
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:41,006
- Let me see your hand.
- I smell hair!

478
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:43,842
I'll get the burn ointment.
You'll be all right.

479
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:46,011
Ouch!

480
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,233
OK, let's see, we...

481
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:01,568
Way to hustle, guys!

482
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:03,737
You all right?

483
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,573
Well, now we know they work.

484
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:11,286
- Pretty good eats!
- Should mashed potatoes be crunchy?

485
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:13,747
Where are you going?

486
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:18,627
Out! I go out every night after dinner.

487
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:22,214
Meet the boys at the bowling alley
for a couple of beers.

488
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:26,343
- Don't leave me alone with them!
- Come on, honey. That's not fair.

489
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:29,680
You know we live like this.
Never bothered you before.

490
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:32,808
It's just the way it is.
You'd better get used to it.

491
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,019
When are you coming home?

492
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:40,274
When I feel like it.
It just depends on how drunk I get.

493
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,376
How's it goin' with your debutante?

494
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:02,796
She's one lousy cook!
But as long as I don't have to do it.

495
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:07,342
- How long are you gonna keep her?
- Let's see. 25 bucks a day, huh?

496
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:13,223
Figure little wifey-poo can work off what
she owes me in... a little over a month.

497
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:16,351
- Your first night with her, huh?
- Mm-hm.

498
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:17,811
Uh-huh! Come on, huh!

499
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:22,900
I'm not gonna tell you
she doesn't have a great body.

500
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:26,069
And a pretty decent face...
Ah, she's too rich for my blood!

501
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:29,990
Chocolate cake's a bit rich too,
but I'd like to eat one once in a while.

502
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:33,035
Not my style.
Course, eating a whole cake isn't, either.

503
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,496
But I'm gonna have some fun
with her tonight!

504
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,082
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you drinkin'?

505
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,375
Some rotgut. Cheapest stuff they got.

506
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,336
Perfect.

507
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:45,923
Wait!

508
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:49,426
You jumped my bones
the first night we met!

509
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:54,098
- We did it on the first date?
- Well, I couldn't call it a date, really.

510
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:57,559
We just did it right there
in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven.

511
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:01,146
- I'm a slut.
- Huh?

512
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:02,689
Nothing.

513
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:05,400
- Ooh!
- Oh!

514
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:09,113
Hey, I'm a little drunk tonight,
baby, so, you know,

515
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:11,907
it might take me a while to get there.

516
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:15,285
Oh! What? No boom-boom?

517
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,956
Well, hey, I understand.

518
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:23,377
You probably just wanna go right
to sleep and skip the fun stuff, huh?

519
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,087
- Yes.
- OK.

520
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:27,589
Thank you. No boom-boom.

521
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,219
- Baby.
- Hm?

522
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:35,347
- The couch.
- What?

523
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:39,768
You see, honey, you've got a bad back
because the bed's too soft for you.

524
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:43,105
That's why you always sleep
on the living-room couch.

525
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:01,874
I'm a short... fat... slut.

526
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:18,307
Get off of my body!

527
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:20,476
Rover!

528
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:53,026
- Up, up, up, up, up! Come on!
- Help! Help!

529
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:57,573
Time to get up. Gotta fix the kids' lunches
or they'll miss the bus for school.

530
00:39:57,698 --> 00:40:00,451
I don't care if they don't go to school.

531
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:05,122
OK. They'll just be with you all day.

532
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:08,584
Bye, Mom!

533
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:12,337
Whoa, whoa, the bus is here!
7.15, let's go!

534
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:14,214
Hurry up, Mom!

535
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,144
Roy. Roy!

536
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:30,272
My name is Travis.

537
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,817
Travis.

538
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,653
Travisss!

539
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:40,991
Come on, Joey.

540
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:42,618
Stop honking!

541
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:50,250
Twin! Oh, twin!

542
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:53,087
She means you.
Have a good day at school, honey.

543
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:57,132
You ready? You ready?
Come on, come on!

544
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,551
Bye, Mom. You're doin' a great job.

545
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,137
I'm off to work.

546
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:05,224
Somebody's gotta keep this family
in the lap of luxury.

547
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:10,395
I figured you'd forget,
so I made it for you myself.

548
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:13,482
- What?
- Your list of daily chores.

549
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:15,651
See ya tonight.

550
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:18,612
- Dean?
- D Zippety doo dah!

551
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:20,114
D Zippety yay!

552
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,242
D My oh my, I got a wonderful slave

553
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,411
And you are a genius!

554
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:43,637
You're living in a nightmare
that starts at the crack of dawn.

555
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:49,309
Down! Down!

556
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:56,483
# <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

557
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,486
# <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

558
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:01,989
# <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

559
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:05,033
# <i>Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!</i>

560
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:23,135
# <i>Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!</i>

561
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:28,474
Dinner! Dinner!

562
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:46,301
She needs food.

563
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:50,556
This is fun.

564
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,769
Hey, guys.

565
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:01,900
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothing. We're OK. We're fine.

566
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:04,987
- How about you?
- Oh, no. What's wrong with her?

567
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:07,781
She's been like that for an hour now.

568
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,076
- She's getting better, though.
- Better?

569
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:13,245
Yeah, she's not going "Ba-ba-ba..."

570
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,582
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

571
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:19,376
- Why did she do that?
- She destroyed the scarecrow.

572
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:21,336
She ripped the sucker's head off!

573
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:27,384
I like when she goes
"Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba."

574
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:29,219
Hey! Baby doll!

575
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:33,098
What's for dinner?

576
00:44:33,223 --> 00:44:37,519
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu ba-ba-ha-ha...

577
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:40,647
OK! I'll take it from here.
Go on, get upstairs!

578
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,403
- Will you trade her in for a new one?
- Nah, she'll be all right.

579
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,989
Come on, guys! Move it!

580
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,373
Feel better?

581
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:03,670
I don't belong here. I feel it.
Don't you think I feel it?

582
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:08,258
I can't do any of these vile things
and I wouldn't want to!

583
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,137
My life is like death!

584
00:45:12,262 --> 00:45:16,391
My children are the spawn of hell
and you're the devil.

585
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,560
Oh, God...

586
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:27,111
Baby, we <i>like</i> you.

587
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:31,782
She's OK. She's doin' the dishes.

588
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:35,160
- No more "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba".
- Good. All right.

589
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:36,453
- Dad?
- Yeah?

590
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:40,290
- Will she figure out we're tricking her?
- Not if we don't blow it.

591
00:45:43,794 --> 00:45:46,880
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for memorabilia.

592
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:49,716
Memora-what?

593
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:52,594
Scrapbooks. Photographs.

594
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:56,974
Something that will spark
some wisp of a memory.

595
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,560
Do we or do we not possess these things?

596
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:02,688
Uh, well...

597
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:06,108
Do you mean to tell me
there is no photographic evidence

598
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:10,070
of our life together...
anywhere in existence?

599
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:13,574
Well, I don't know
where they'd be because, uh...

600
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:16,368
you know,
we lost a lot of stuff in the move.

601
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:19,204
And it's possible that, uh...

602
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:21,707
we lost...

603
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:40,517
The closet

604
00:46:41,894 --> 00:46:43,729
and you.

605
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:50,110
That's right. This is me...
and I'm standing in front of the closet.

606
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:53,113
Something's familiar.

607
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:57,993
You got it. We used to do it in the closet.

608
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,037
Oh, stop with the sex stories!

609
00:47:00,162 --> 00:47:02,623
You're grumpy
because you've been busy.

610
00:47:02,748 --> 00:47:06,251
I want you to stop everything,
go on in here, take a bath...

611
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:09,046
Hey, guys!
Get the turtle out of the bathtub!

612
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:12,174
I'll look for the pictures
first thing in the morning, OK?

613
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:14,343
All right. Good night, honey.

614
00:47:49,378 --> 00:47:52,089
- Somebody better be dead!
- Billy!

615
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:54,174
Billy, I want you to do me a favour.

616
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:56,427
- Who you talkin' to?
- Nobody.

617
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:57,886
- Who's that?
- No one.

618
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,471
Hey, is that Dean?

619
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:02,307
- Hi, Dean. Come on in.
- Go back to bed, Gertie.

620
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:06,770
- If you treat me like that, I'm goin' home.
- Come on, Gertie, don't be like that!

621
00:48:06,895 --> 00:48:10,107
Remember in high school you faked
our IDs? I need a fake bride.

622
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:13,944
- Come on, Dean. I'm busy!
- Not any more. She's goin' home.

623
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:16,697
OK, but if we get caught, it's your ass!

624
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:21,702
It's my wedding day.
Why do I look so annoyed?

625
00:48:21,827 --> 00:48:24,204
Oh, yeah. Your dad showed up shit-faced.

626
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:27,624
He threw potato salad all over my mom.
We had to throw him out!

627
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,544
Why do I always have
this depressed look on my face?

628
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:34,506
You were grumpy a lot. You were losing
the weight, then you gained it back.

629
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:38,302
- Thin, fat, thin, fat.
- Was I <i>always</i> this miserable?

630
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:41,555
- Wasn't I ever happy?
- Well, sure, honey. Lots.

631
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,475
You were the happiest
little wife and mother around!

632
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,437
Look at this. Before you lost the weight.
Can you believe it?

633
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:53,442
All right. Now, that's it. Are you satisfied?

634
00:48:54,443 --> 00:48:56,487
- Yes.
- Good.

635
00:48:57,863 --> 00:49:00,741
I suppose I belong here in this... hovel.

636
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:04,369
Come on, Jackson!

637
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:07,331
Well, this is my life.

638
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:10,000
I didn't marry very well, did I?

639
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,341
# <i>Your body</i>

640
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:21,345
I love LA. I love all my starlets!

641
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,014
- What were your names again?
- Tofutti Klein.

642
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,100
Tofutti! I love it!

643
00:49:26,225 --> 00:49:28,477
If that's my mother-in-law,
I'm not here.

644
00:49:28,602 --> 00:49:30,896
You're Kim and Kimberly...

645
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:34,399
- The Stayton yacht.
- <i>Hello, Andrew. It's Mrs Mintz</i>.

646
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:36,527
I'm so virile, I'm so rich!

647
00:49:36,652 --> 00:49:38,737
<i>I'd like to speak to my daughter</i>.

648
00:49:38,862 --> 00:49:41,407
<i>They're not here, madam</i>.
<i>They've gone shopping</i>.

649
00:49:46,912 --> 00:49:49,456
Uh, a little bit lower.

650
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:52,167
Yeah. Yeah, lower.

651
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,963
That's good. That's good.

652
00:49:57,589 --> 00:50:01,635
- Were you really in the Coast Guard?
- Damn right.

653
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,846
Why does he keep staring at me?

654
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:05,806
- Is he?
- Yes! He was staring at me

655
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:08,142
with his mouth open all through dinner.

656
00:50:08,267 --> 00:50:12,187
Well, honey,
Billy was your high-school boyfriend.

657
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:17,693
You don't get any of the old feelings back
when you look at him, do you?

658
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:28,746
I don't wanna do it!

659
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:32,791
You gotta do it
if you wanna be a gruesome ghoul!

660
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:35,711
It's part of the initiation! Think about it.

661
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:38,922
That's good. Thanks a lot. Ah, yeah.

662
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:43,802
Uh, sugarlips.
I think our guest needs another beer.

663
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:47,723
Uh, well, I really shouldn't,
but maybe, uh... just one more

664
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,558
six-pack!

665
00:50:55,314 --> 00:50:57,274
- Attagirl!
- Thank you.

666
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:59,026
That's all the beer.

667
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,653
Whoa, buttercup!
Just about time for dessert!

668
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:04,364
- How about some brownies?
- I didn't make any.

669
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,409
- How about chocolate cream pie?
- I made that.

670
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:11,330
- Is this gonna work?
- My ideas always work. I'm gifted.

671
00:51:11,455 --> 00:51:14,750
I loved it when you glued Joey
to the toilet seat.

672
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:20,923
I was thinking about it at work.
We need a theme for the golf course.

673
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:25,803
We can use a few contraptions
you can knock some golf balls through.

674
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:29,264
- What's the score? I had my eyes closed.
- 32-10.

675
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,809
- Who's winning?
- The guys with 32.

676
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:46,365
- Great!
- Who did this?!

677
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,702
Travis!

678
00:51:50,828 --> 00:51:53,122
Hey, honey, what happened?

679
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:56,333
Oooh! <i>This</i> happened.

680
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:02,798
- You guys are beggin' for it!
- Stop blustering! You won't punish them!

681
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:05,551
Ease up there, love chop! Just ease up.

682
00:52:05,676 --> 00:52:08,178
Ease up? Ease up?

683
00:52:09,054 --> 00:52:12,307
Since I walked through that door,
I have cooked, cleaned,

684
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,309
scrubbed, chopped wood.

685
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:18,272
I've waited on you, your dogs,
your kids and your friends

686
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:21,733
in the hopes that I would
remember some shred of my life

687
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:25,279
and now it is entirely clear to me
why I've chosen to block it out!

688
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:28,282
- Now, none of this ever...
- Bothered me before.

689
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:30,075
Well, it bothers me now.

690
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:35,247
- All right, Joe!
- Is that so?

691
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:40,210
Hey, hey, Joe! Come on, guys!
No more jokes on Mom today, huh?

692
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:42,463
You really got her where you want her.

693
00:52:42,588 --> 00:52:45,507
I got everything under control,
don't worry.

694
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:48,761
- This is flat. Give me another one, Billy.
- I only got six.

695
00:52:48,886 --> 00:52:52,598
We're just gonna have to send out
the old ball and chain to buy some more.

696
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:01,899
Good stuff!

697
00:53:02,024 --> 00:53:04,067
Your chocolate cream pie.

698
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:13,952
Thanks, honey.

699
00:53:14,078 --> 00:53:18,165
I guess it's kinda tough to serve
with your hands stuck to plates.

700
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:23,670
Honey, we need forks!

701
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:27,132
- Sugarlips!
- Yeah?

702
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:33,222
Wait a minute!

703
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:39,520
Fire, fire, fire!

704
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:47,027
- Yeah!
- OK, guys, go get her!

705
00:53:52,366 --> 00:53:54,410
Hey, thanks for a lovely dinner.

706
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:57,579
- She never did that before.
- She did it now!

707
00:53:57,704 --> 00:54:00,582
- Look at this! I gotta go to work!
- Wait for me!

708
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,419
She went this way, guys!

709
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:06,004
Gruesome ghouls, attack!

710
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,841
- What should I do, Travis?
- Go home!

711
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:15,472
I got you!

712
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,479
- Tickle her!
- She's ticklish!

713
00:54:23,105 --> 00:54:25,149
Ow, that hurts! Ow!

714
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:28,986
Leave me alone!

715
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:32,781
All right, time to get up.

716
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:36,869
Go to the bathroom
and do what you normally do.

717
00:54:36,994 --> 00:54:39,955
- You gonna squirt us with a hose again?
- That's up to you.

718
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,209
- I gotta feed my turtle.
- The damn turtle stole my headband.

719
00:54:44,334 --> 00:54:46,378
Joey, come on. Time to get up!

720
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:50,299
I don't want to! The teacher's a big fat tub!

721
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:53,093
Proffitt boys, come up here!

722
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:00,017
Miss Pitcannon tells me
you don't wanna take these tests.

723
00:55:00,142 --> 00:55:02,644
I'm itchin' and I wanna go home!

724
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:06,940
You may go stand in the corner
until you can talk like a little boy!

725
00:55:08,192 --> 00:55:10,944
All of you children
are new in this school.

726
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,656
These scores will determine
your placement in future classes.

727
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:18,744
- You must concentrate... Greg! Stop that!
- Make a face.

728
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:20,996
- I'm in real bad shape!
- Nonsense!

729
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:25,667
Now, if you concentrate, I'm sure
you can control those little bodies.

730
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,629
I see that, Amanda.

731
00:55:28,754 --> 00:55:30,798
Joey, sit!

732
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:35,385
- Is anyone at your home?
- Yeah. Our mom is.

733
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:38,889
You have a mother now?
Your father remarried?

734
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:42,976
Um, yeah. We got a new mother now.

735
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:46,688
Well, good.
Then I'm calling <i>both</i> your parents!

736
00:55:52,277 --> 00:55:55,823
Mrs Burbridge, I'm Annie Proffitt.
What happened?

737
00:55:55,948 --> 00:56:00,452
Well, Mrs Proffitt, apparently
your children consider themselves

738
00:56:00,577 --> 00:56:03,288
above taking
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests.

739
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:06,291
I'm sorry. What are
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests?

740
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:11,839
Placement tests. They are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential.

741
00:56:11,964 --> 00:56:13,215
Sit still!

742
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,260
Your children are a discipline problem.

743
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:19,763
I know. I have had difficulties myself.

744
00:56:20,305 --> 00:56:23,642
- What did you do now?
- Oh! They decided to play sick!

745
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:26,228
And not very convincingly.

746
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:31,191
Now, I believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance.

747
00:56:31,316 --> 00:56:34,027
The children are slovenly, incorrigible

748
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:38,949
and being reared by a father who clearly
isn't concerned about their welfare,

749
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:42,035
but is himself just a large child!

750
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:45,998
- Excuse me, Mrs Burbridge.
- Oh, the test results. Thank you.

751
00:56:46,123 --> 00:56:49,960
I'll look these over as soon as
I'm finished with this... <i>woman</i>.

752
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:52,087
Oh, my God.

753
00:56:56,675 --> 00:56:59,470
I'll see you later in the cafeteria.

754
00:57:01,472 --> 00:57:04,850
Mrs Burbridge,
would you come over here for a moment?

755
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,522
Has it escaped your attention that these
children have head-to-toe poison oak?

756
00:57:10,647 --> 00:57:13,108
Well, no... Yes, but...

757
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:16,987
But what? My children are
in need of medical assistance!

758
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:21,158
And you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests?

759
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:25,829
Tests which label children's potential -
a thing which <i>cannot</i> be measured!

760
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:28,874
Least of all by anal-compulsive Huns!

761
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:34,755
And my husband may be a large child,
but that's none of your business.

762
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,466
And my children may be rotten,
but they're mine!

763
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:40,177
And I think that they're bright
and sensitive.

764
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:43,514
So I have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence!

765
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,725
I do, however,
have serious doubts about yours!

766
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,020
Kids, get in the car. Let's go.

767
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:51,396
Move!

768
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:57,152
- She told her off.
- Dad never did that.

769
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:00,572
Discipline problem?

770
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:04,118
My regards to
Schwartzman and Heinliken.

771
00:58:05,494 --> 00:58:08,080
I can't stop itching!

772
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:12,334
Well, what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak?

773
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:18,173
What I want you to do, what the doctor
said, is put it right on the red parts.

774
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:19,425
OK?

775
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,178
Soon we're going to clean up
this room because it's a disgrace.

776
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:26,974
- We like it like a disgrace.
- Dad lets us do whatever we want!

777
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,560
Yeah, well, it's trickling
down the stairway.

778
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:33,814
Joey, don't. Don't get that near your eyes.
Look, I want you to read this.

779
00:58:33,939 --> 00:58:37,317
See what it says?
"Don't get near your eyes." Read on.

780
00:58:44,408 --> 00:58:48,245
- What's this all about?
- He's embarrassed cos he can't read.

781
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,749
- Well, he's a small child.
- He can't read for a small child either.

782
00:58:51,874 --> 00:58:54,793
The teacher makes fun of him!

783
00:58:56,754 --> 00:58:59,089
OK, we'll talk about this later.
Go to sleep.

784
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,383
- Dean!
- Where is that?

785
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:02,968
- Dean!
- Yeah!

786
00:59:03,093 --> 00:59:05,095
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

787
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,015
Out. If I could ever find my...

788
00:59:08,515 --> 00:59:10,601
Oh, wait. Wait!

789
00:59:10,726 --> 00:59:12,770
Not tonight! We have to talk.

790
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:16,899
- When I get home. I'm in a hurry.
- Now!

791
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:22,780
You know, I let the water routine slide by
the other day, but let's not push it, OK?

792
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:26,241
I got a little carried away with the hose,
but this is important.

793
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:28,911
OK, fine. What's on your mind, sugarlips?

794
00:59:29,036 --> 00:59:32,414
Stop calling me sugarlips!
I have a name. Call me Annie.

795
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:35,876
Get to the point, <i>Annie</i>. I'm busy.
The guys are waitin' for me.

796
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:40,339
You can't run out every time things get
complicated here. The kids are sick!

797
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:43,133
They got calamine lotion.
What do you want me to do?

798
00:59:43,258 --> 00:59:48,222
- Take on some grown-up responsibility!
- I earn the money. That's a responsibility.

799
00:59:48,764 --> 00:59:53,018
Are you aware that Joey can't read?
That Travis only reads smut magazines?

800
00:59:53,143 --> 00:59:57,648
- I can't get him out of the bathroom.
- He's 13! I'll build you another bathroom!

801
00:59:57,773 --> 01:00:00,734
They don't need that!
They need guidance from you!

802
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:06,031
Oh-oh-oh! Now, don't you worry
about me and my boys, OK? We're pals.

803
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,659
They have enough pals.
They need a father.

804
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:12,663
Hey, hey, hey, look. I decided
a long time before you... you and me...

805
01:00:12,788 --> 01:00:16,208
<i>We</i> decided a long time ago,
before we started this family,

806
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:19,753
we'd raise these kids naturally,
not force bullshit rules...

807
01:00:19,878 --> 01:00:22,548
I'm not talking about discipline.
I'm talking...

808
01:00:22,673 --> 01:00:27,553
Stuff you shouldn't be talking about!
It's none of your business, anyway.

809
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:31,682
- My children are none of my business?
- Look... I have... Now I'm late!

810
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:33,851
Thanks a lot(!) Appreciate it.

811
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:21,440
Say, Annie. Are you asleep?

812
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:23,984
No. Go away.

813
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:25,903
Uh... listen. I'm...

814
01:01:26,695 --> 01:01:29,364
I'm sorry I came down on you
so hard before.

815
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:32,826
It's OK.

816
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:37,623
Just so you won't think I don't appreciate
all the work you're doin' in the house

817
01:01:37,748 --> 01:01:40,834
and how you handle the kids
and all that, uh...

818
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:44,338
You know, I think you're doin' great.

819
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:49,259
I mean, what you said about me
and the boys tonight, uh...

820
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:52,221
I guess you probably...

821
01:01:53,055 --> 01:01:57,392
You know, maybe you got a small point
there, and I just... I can't...

822
01:01:58,268 --> 01:02:00,729
I can't talk to you
while you're turned away.

823
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:03,774
- Will you just please get your head out?
- No.

824
01:02:03,899 --> 01:02:05,943
- No!
- Why?

825
01:02:08,237 --> 01:02:10,280
Because I'm so ugly.

826
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,659
I got poison oak, too!

827
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:17,579
Come on, now.
Nobody cares what you look like.

828
01:02:17,704 --> 01:02:22,000
I mean, we do like the way you look.
Normally you look real pretty.

829
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:24,837
You just don't now.

830
01:02:25,546 --> 01:02:27,589
All right, forget it.

831
01:02:28,382 --> 01:02:31,635
I don't even have a wedding ring!

832
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,723
- What?
- I lost my wedding ring in the sea.

833
01:02:38,016 --> 01:02:40,978
OK, come on. Come on.

834
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:43,814
Let's go.

835
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:47,818
Oh, no.
I'm not going back in the water barrel!

836
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:52,197
I'm puttin' you in the bedroom.
I'll take the couch.

837
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,451
Oh, hey, listen.
I've had poison oak a million times.

838
01:02:55,576 --> 01:02:57,786
Come on, guys. Up! Up!

839
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:02,499
Yeah. You know,
I once got poison oak on my bu... back.

840
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,710
And, uh...

841
01:03:04,835 --> 01:03:08,839
Well, don't you worry.
It'll be gone in no time. Lift your head.

842
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:11,925
- That's it. Is that better?
- Yeah.

843
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,094
- All right?
- Yes.

844
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:19,266
Tell me something about my life,
about my past. Please.

845
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:22,311
Something not horrible.

846
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:25,481
Uh, OK.

847
01:03:29,026 --> 01:03:33,447
Yeah. Well, there was that time, uh...

848
01:03:33,572 --> 01:03:35,157
...when you were, uh...

849
01:03:35,282 --> 01:03:37,534
You were working at...

850
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:40,245
yeah, Burger Boy over in Lewisville.

851
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:44,666
And, uh, this kid started
choking on a French fry.

852
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:48,295
Everybody there panicked,
including me, except for you.

853
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:54,093
You ran over to him and you gave him
that Heimlich manoeuvre, where you...

854
01:03:54,885 --> 01:03:57,513
And poof! The kid puked up the fry

855
01:03:57,638 --> 01:04:00,474
and they named you
Burger Boy employee of the month.

856
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:04,895
It was great. They put your picture
above the cash register and...

857
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,773
I was really proud of you. I mean it.

858
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,862
You can be quite charming
when you wanna be.

859
01:04:14,947 --> 01:04:17,866
Ah. You just caught me on a bad day.

860
01:04:20,953 --> 01:04:23,163
Good night... Annie.

861
01:04:24,748 --> 01:04:26,792
Good night.

862
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:37,136
- Heads up!
- After I finished with the Coast Guard,

863
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:40,097
I looked up Dean.
We used to play football together.

864
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:43,934
Used to call him Mean Dean Proffitt.
Used to call me Bad Billy Pratt.

865
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:46,520
- Out!
- Now, Billy, when did we date?

866
01:04:49,314 --> 01:04:51,358
Let's eat!

867
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:55,237
- It might be...
- Are we talking about the golf course?

868
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:58,240
Yeah. The guys with suits
come down in less than a week.

869
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:00,159
What do you think about this, huh?

870
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:03,579
Sink 'Em and Drink 'Em.
18 holes based on famous breweries.

871
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:06,415
I think what I thought yesterday.
It's a lousy idea.

872
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,168
I thought you'd change your mind
now you're sober.

873
01:05:09,293 --> 01:05:12,379
What about other places? Foreign places.

874
01:05:12,504 --> 01:05:14,548
What do you mean?
Like France or Africa?

875
01:05:14,673 --> 01:05:17,092
<i>Mais oui!</i>
<i>La Tour Eiffel, comme c'est jolie!</i>

876
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:19,845
I speak French!

877
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:23,015
It just came out.

878
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,350
Do I know what I said?

879
01:05:25,476 --> 01:05:27,269
Yes, I do.

880
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:29,521
I must have learned that in Paris.

881
01:05:30,606 --> 01:05:32,649
When was I in Paris?

882
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:35,611
In the Navy.

883
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:38,822
- Navy.
- Well, it's a stupid idea in any language.

884
01:05:38,947 --> 01:05:41,617
Besides, we're building
these things in America.

885
01:05:42,117 --> 01:05:44,203
Wait a minute. This isn't a bad idea.

886
01:05:44,328 --> 01:05:46,872
I could invent some wild things here.
Go on.

887
01:05:46,997 --> 01:05:50,667
Well, like, uh... the Taj Mahal,
Seven Wonders of the World.

888
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:55,089
- Bring them to the people of Elk Cove!
- Well, I gotta bring it in for a price.

889
01:05:55,214 --> 01:05:58,008
I can bring it in,
but can you draw me some pictures

890
01:05:58,133 --> 01:06:00,761
so I can see what you mean? Annie?

891
01:06:05,557 --> 01:06:07,810
- What's this?
- Travis found a girlfriend.

892
01:06:07,935 --> 01:06:10,979
Hey, Trav! Don't knock her up!

893
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,776
- Very funny! Watch your...
- Oh, Mom!

894
01:06:15,901 --> 01:06:18,112
Yeah, "Oh, Mom!" Watch your language!

895
01:06:18,237 --> 01:06:20,572
Come on! What are you talkin' about?

896
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:23,784
- Pick a wonder.
- Stevie Wonder.

897
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:27,913
- Give me a wonder. One wonder.
- There's Mount Rushmore.

898
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:30,082
- The Parthenon.
- Parthenon, right.

899
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:34,461
- St Basil's, the Russian cathedral.
- Grand Canyon. Everybody'll love that!

900
01:06:34,586 --> 01:06:36,964
- Egyptian pyramids.
- The Eiffel Tower.

901
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:42,177
It's expensive. I gotta build...
If it rains... Hey, fibreglass! Perfect!

902
01:06:45,514 --> 01:06:48,976
Let's clean up for an early dinner.
I've got a lot of drawing to do.

903
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:51,145
Isn't Dad gonna eat with us tonight?

904
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,564
No! He had to go out.

905
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,109
- He had to go bowling this time.
- Really?

906
01:06:57,234 --> 01:07:00,195
It's pretty hard to go bowling
without a bowling ball.

907
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:19,339
D I know I done you wrong

908
01:07:19,465 --> 01:07:22,509
d Do you remember
that rainy evening I put you out

909
01:07:22,634 --> 01:07:24,136
d With nothin' but a fine-toothed comb

910
01:07:24,261 --> 01:07:26,430
What would you want
with old sweet-mouth?

911
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:29,057
D Ain't that a shame, I know I'm to blame

912
01:07:29,183 --> 01:07:32,686
d Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home?

913
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:40,819
<i>Scott Murphy,</i>
<i>bring your invoice up to the front</i>.

914
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:44,490
This ain't your average
pile of fertiliser here.

915
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:49,244
Uh-uh. No, siree.
This here's a special blend.

916
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:54,374
Fish heads, shrimp skins,
crab claws, earthworm droppings...

917
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,794
I don't wanna know that much about it.

918
01:07:56,919 --> 01:08:00,005
- Here you go.
- After this, you get to shovel fish guts!

919
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,633
If you're lucky,
we'll let you clean the truck!

920
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:07,471
- Whoops! I forgot to give you this.
- What have I got to put on airs for?

921
01:08:07,596 --> 01:08:09,640
Oh, stop fussing. You look great.

922
01:08:09,765 --> 01:08:13,936
Well, they put their pants on
just like me - one leg at a time.

923
01:08:14,061 --> 01:08:16,188
Now, don't be nervous, OK?

924
01:08:16,313 --> 01:08:18,232
If you don't get it, so what?

925
01:08:18,357 --> 01:08:21,693
We've been through
rougher times than these before.

926
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:23,862
I think.

927
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:33,372
Gentlemen, this is Dean Proffitt,
inventor and master craftsman.

928
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:36,375
What we're here for this evening is this.

929
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,379
It's the Wonders of the World
miniature golf course.

930
01:08:40,504 --> 01:08:44,383
If you look at these pictures,
you can begin to sort of feel...

931
01:08:44,508 --> 01:08:48,512
What we're trying to do is bring some
of this outer world here into Elk Cove.

932
01:08:48,637 --> 01:08:51,807
The Leaning Tower of Pizza
doubles as a pizza stand.

933
01:08:51,932 --> 01:08:55,644
That sort of gives us an idea
of where we might go in the future.

934
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:59,690
Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Here, let me get that.

935
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:02,025
Waitress! Get over here, will you?

936
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,863
Have you ever been nervous in your life?

937
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,372
Go ahead, ask me.
Ask me if we got the money.

938
01:09:15,497 --> 01:09:17,124
Did you get the money?

939
01:09:17,249 --> 01:09:19,626
- We got the money!
- Oooh, great!

940
01:09:19,752 --> 01:09:22,254
- That's so great!
- Can you believe it?!

941
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:33,974
Step up! She rolls up here... and down.

942
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:38,812
It's got three choices. This time,
it's going through the oil funnel,

943
01:09:38,937 --> 01:09:43,067
past the plastic fan,
into the kids' sand shovel and flour sifter.

944
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:47,780
Now, turn around quick. Here it comes.
It should be out about now.

945
01:09:47,905 --> 01:09:49,990
- OK, now show me your invention.
- You're gonna hate it.

946
01:09:50,115 --> 01:09:52,034
I'm not gonna hate it. I love 'em.

947
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:58,957
That's nice.

948
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:08,008
I gotta tell her, Billy.
I gotta tell Annie the truth.

949
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:11,220
In the beginning, it was OK
because it was part of a gag.

950
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:14,723
Now it's more like lies. I...
I know what you're thinkin'.

951
01:10:14,848 --> 01:10:18,477
- Hey, I'm not thinkin' anything.
- Yeah, you are and I'm gonna tell her.

952
01:10:18,602 --> 01:10:20,646
I know it's time to tell her!

953
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,777
Ooh, Dr Death looks mad.

954
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:30,572
- Joker's saying "No".
- I know. What does he say up here?

955
01:10:31,323 --> 01:10:34,076
"I will re... re... re..."

956
01:10:34,201 --> 01:10:39,081
- Reduce.
- "Reduce your puny planet to rub..."

957
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,000
- Ru... ru...
- Rubble.

958
01:10:42,126 --> 01:10:44,837
Good! That's very good, sweetie.

959
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:48,382
Are you gonna leave?

960
01:10:50,259 --> 01:10:52,219
No. I'm your mommy.

961
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:55,472
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Sometimes moms leave.

962
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:59,601
Well, I guess maybe they do.
But I'm not gonna go anywhere.

963
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:01,770
Good.

964
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:05,733
Oooh, what is this?
Is this a present for me?

965
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:09,570
- Yes. I made it from macaroni.
- I love it.

966
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:12,239
I'll always wear it.

967
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,826
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi! How's it goin', guys?

968
01:11:15,951 --> 01:11:18,370
I got the part of Tiny Tim
in the school play.

969
01:11:18,495 --> 01:11:20,914
- I got an A in English.
- I'm flunkin' math.

970
01:11:21,832 --> 01:11:24,835
Well, I guess we better
work on it later on, huh?

971
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,005
You're just in time.
Dr Death is on the rampage.

972
01:11:29,673 --> 01:11:31,592
Annie, I need to talk to you.

973
01:11:31,717 --> 01:11:33,761
Alone, guys.

974
01:11:37,723 --> 01:11:40,476
- Is something wrong?
- Uh, well...

975
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:43,187
No. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

976
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:47,024
No, I just... I need to tell you somethin'.
Here, sit down.

977
01:11:47,608 --> 01:11:49,651
What is it?

978
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:54,239
Annie, I've done...
I've done something that, um...

979
01:11:54,364 --> 01:11:56,992
I'm ashamed of. And I just...

980
01:11:57,117 --> 01:12:00,162
- I already know.
- You do?

981
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:07,127
- What... What do you know?
- You work nights at the fertiliser plant.

982
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:13,967
You don't have to be ashamed
because you shovel fish guts.

983
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,679
I'm proud of you no matter what you do.

984
01:12:17,805 --> 01:12:21,850
- Is that it?
- Uh, well, that's one of the things, but I...

985
01:12:21,975 --> 01:12:25,354
No. Not really.

986
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,065
What is it?

987
01:12:33,612 --> 01:12:35,864
Annie...

988
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:42,371
I...

989
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:46,083
I... God, I forgot your birthday.

990
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,753
- It's my birthday?
- Come on! Get dressed!

991
01:12:56,135 --> 01:12:58,387
D Jim Dandy to the rescue

992
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,390

993
01:13:02,057 --> 01:13:04,435

997

998

999

1002
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:31,128
- What?
- Are we going home?

1003
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:34,339
- Oh, no. I just... Aren't you hot?
- Yeah. Let's go outside.

1004
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:37,718
- Come on!
- Hey, let's not forget this. It's $7 a pop.

1005
01:13:37,843 --> 01:13:41,680
Don't worry about what it costs.
It's your birthday! I got it covered.

1006
01:13:44,183 --> 01:13:46,852
Just one last toast to your birthday.

1007
01:13:47,728 --> 01:13:49,980
Oh! Whoops, I lost my bottom.

1008
01:13:50,105 --> 01:13:51,690
Wait a minute.

1009
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:55,235
There! They always do that. Now, this is...

1010
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,529
- Happy birthday, Annie.
- Thanks, Dean.

1011
01:14:00,157 --> 01:14:03,869
- I've never tasted anything quite like this.
- It's good stuff.

1012
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:06,997
Boy, it sure is pretty, isn't it?

1013
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,793
Why do they honk three times?

1014
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:12,961
To signal they're comin' home.

1015
01:14:13,087 --> 01:14:18,258
Yeah, it's a legend... of Arturo,
who was a Portuguese fisherman.

1016
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:22,096
He met this beautiful girl
his first night in town - Catarina.

1017
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:25,057
And, um, eventually they fell in love.

1018
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:29,186
But the problem was that Catarina's
father was the territorial governor.

1019
01:14:29,311 --> 01:14:32,606
He didn't want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman.

1020
01:14:32,731 --> 01:14:35,692
So he told Arturo
that he'd have to ship off,

1021
01:14:35,818 --> 01:14:39,446
which he did, but he told Catarina
he'd be back for her

1022
01:14:39,571 --> 01:14:43,492
and when he came back,
he'd signal with three long blasts

1023
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:48,080
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat, and they'd be on their way.

1024
01:14:48,205 --> 01:14:50,082
Oh, I love this story.

1025
01:14:50,207 --> 01:14:53,127
So, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1026
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:55,587
But when she was swimmin' out
to the boat,

1027
01:14:55,712 --> 01:14:59,383
the fog got so thick that, uh,
she couldn't find the boat.

1028
01:15:00,259 --> 01:15:03,971
Arturo panicked
and he called out "Catarina! Catarina!"

1029
01:15:04,096 --> 01:15:06,056
Catarina yelled back "Arturo!"

1030
01:15:06,181 --> 01:15:10,436
With that, he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters, and they...

1031
01:15:10,561 --> 01:15:12,938
- Kissed.
- No, they drowned.

1032
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:15,566
They never found each other
and they drowned.

1033
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:19,445
- Oh, that's a terrible story!
- Yeah, but the legend is

1034
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:23,699
they reunited at the bottom of the sea,
right over there,

1035
01:15:23,824 --> 01:15:28,287
and every time you see
the spray goin' up, it's them.

1036
01:15:28,412 --> 01:15:31,707
- Making love?
- Yeah.

1037
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:33,876
For ever and ever.

1038
01:15:42,634 --> 01:15:47,139
D For I can't help

1039
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:53,145
d Falling in love...

1040
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:55,314
Dean?

1041
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:58,776
What, Annie?

1042
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,403
How old am I?

1043
01:16:06,784 --> 01:16:08,827
29.

1044
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:13,308
- Dean.
- Yeah?

1045
01:17:14,268 --> 01:17:16,311
Was it always like this?

1046
01:17:18,272 --> 01:17:20,941
Every time with you is like the first time.

1047
01:17:46,383 --> 01:17:48,177
Oh, come on, guys!

1048
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:50,554
Hey, let us sleep for a while!

1049
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:52,723
Right, that's it! I'm gonna spank 'em.

1050
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:56,727
- No! Dean, please don't.
- Every one of them's gonna get it!

1051
01:17:57,519 --> 01:17:58,937
Surprise!

1052
01:17:59,063 --> 01:18:01,356
- A washing machine!
- Do you like it?

1053
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:04,443
Honey, it's so expensive.

1054
01:18:04,568 --> 01:18:06,612
No shit!

1055
01:18:08,906 --> 01:18:10,741
Thank you.

1056
01:18:10,866 --> 01:18:14,161
She might have no tits
but she has a nice ass.

1057
01:18:30,302 --> 01:18:32,137
Grant?

1058
01:18:32,262 --> 01:18:34,098
Edith. Hello.

1059
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:38,185
This is ludicrous, Grant.
I have called every week for two months.

1060
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:40,312
<i>I've looked forward to each call</i>.

1061
01:18:40,437 --> 01:18:43,607
Do you have the gall to tell me
that I've missed her again?

1062
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:46,360
- She's sleeping.
- <i>I don't believe you</i>.

1063
01:18:46,485 --> 01:18:48,862
<i>Grant, if you do not produce Joanna</i>

1064
01:18:48,987 --> 01:18:54,243
in one week, I am going to hire a mass
of mercenaries to hunt you down

1065
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:58,247
and chop off the protruding parts
of your body. Is that clear?

1066
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:01,542
I'll find her. I mean, you'll have
your daughter soon. Bye!

1067
01:19:02,459 --> 01:19:05,879
Andrew. Point the boat back to Elk Snout.

1068
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:09,550
You and Mommy are going
to take a little trip, aren't we?

1069
01:19:09,675 --> 01:19:12,052
We's gonna go bye-bye, yes!

1070
01:19:15,556 --> 01:19:19,017
- Sit there and don't get dirty!
- I hate this.

1071
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:22,020
It's not so bad to get dressed up
every once in a while.

1072
01:19:22,146 --> 01:19:24,398
It's like the goddamn Brady Bunch!

1073
01:19:25,733 --> 01:19:28,736
- Dad's here!
- Mom, Dad's home!

1074
01:19:28,861 --> 01:19:30,904
Hey, guys!

1075
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:35,242
I gotta go put on a suit.
Gertie's picking me up.

1076
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:37,911
How can you go hunting
on such an important day?

1077
01:19:38,036 --> 01:19:42,166
- Easy. Pheasant don't play miniature golf.
- Hunting calms Billy down, honey.

1078
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:46,795
- The ceremonies start in an hour.
- Billy, hang this guy out.

1079
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,131
Sweetie, I'll be ready... in a second.

1080
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:52,634
I lent the station wagon to Gertie
so we have to take the truck.

1081
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,595
God! What a mess.

1082
01:19:57,014 --> 01:19:59,057
Feathers!

1083
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:11,862
"JS".

1084
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:15,991
Honey, would you hand me a towel there?

1085
01:20:16,116 --> 01:20:17,993
Thanks.

1086
01:20:18,118 --> 01:20:20,079
What... What is this?

1087
01:20:20,204 --> 01:20:22,664
No, that's my question.
They were in the truck.

1088
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,085
These are... I dunno what these are.
I... Who...

1089
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:29,046
Here. I, uh, we gotta get going.
We're gonna be late.

1090
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:31,340
Thanks for putting my clothes on the bed.

1091
01:20:31,465 --> 01:20:33,801
- Oh, stop it!
- This is nothing!

1092
01:20:33,926 --> 01:20:37,054
Nothing?
I gave you the best years of my life.

1093
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:39,181
I've raised your children.

1094
01:20:39,306 --> 01:20:42,810
I bore your fruit four times
and you tell me this is nothing?

1095
01:20:42,935 --> 01:20:45,354
You're making a big deal
out of a little thing.

1096
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:48,399
It's the number one cause
of divorce in this country.

1097
01:20:48,524 --> 01:20:51,568
Where's my jacket? What divorce?
What are you saying...

1098
01:20:51,693 --> 01:20:55,114
- I'm saying what I'm saying.
- You're saying what you're saying!

1099
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:58,325
- What, you wanna divorce?
- Well, uh... yeah, maybe I do!

1100
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,912
- Well, you can't have one.
- Oh, really. I can have a divorce.

1101
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:05,833
- Where did I put my damn boots?
- I can get a divorce if I want to.

1102
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:08,419
I don't need your permission.

1103
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:12,464
Do you love her?

1104
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:17,553
Do you?

1105
01:21:18,595 --> 01:21:20,639
Tell me.

1106
01:21:20,764 --> 01:21:23,684
Honestly? Yes and no.

1107
01:21:24,268 --> 01:21:28,397
- More yes than no?
- This is unbelievable! How did you...?!

1108
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:31,775
I'm glad this happened.

1109
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:36,905
I've been tryin' to figure out a way to tell
you this for ever. Come here. Sit down.

1110
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:39,074
I wanna tell you something.

1111
01:21:40,325 --> 01:21:45,122
JS is you. These are yours and we're not
married. There. God, I finally said it!

1112
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:47,291
What's her name? Jacqueline? Josie?

1113
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:50,043
Honey, I'm not your husband
and you're not my wife.

1114
01:21:50,169 --> 01:21:53,338
Is she from that fertiliser plant?
Does she hand out shovels?

1115
01:21:53,464 --> 01:21:56,550
These aren't your kids!
You didn't bear anything!

1116
01:21:56,675 --> 01:21:59,762
- Don't change the subject! Who is she?!
- Forget it! Come here!

1117
01:22:01,305 --> 01:22:05,225
- Guys, we gotta talk and this is serious.
- Mom, we're still all clean!

1118
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:09,480
I just told her about her not being your
mother and I want you to tell her, too.

1119
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:16,779
- Go ahead, tell her.
- Dad, tell her what?

1120
01:22:16,904 --> 01:22:19,907
- Tell her she's not your mother.
- But she is our mother!

1121
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:24,495
No. Don't tell her what I told you
to tell her. Just tell her the truth now, OK?

1122
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:27,664
- Tell her about the day she came home!
- She went for a swim.

1123
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:30,501
We were really worried.
I was up all night pacing.

1124
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:35,214
- You'd never seen her before!
- Don't speak to my children that way!

1125
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:40,719
- What do you think you're doing?
- We won't let you ruin <i>everything</i>.

1126
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:43,388
- We're keepin' her.
- She doesn't belong to you!

1127
01:22:43,514 --> 01:22:46,183
She didn't belong to you,
but that didn't stop you!

1128
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:48,769
- I had my reasons!
- So do we.

1129
01:22:49,853 --> 01:22:51,897
- We like her, Dad!
- You like her, do you?

1130
01:22:52,022 --> 01:22:55,150
So much you'd rather live with her
than your own father?!

1131
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:05,953
- Found 'em in the glove compartment?
- Yeah. Tell me every sordid detail.

1132
01:23:06,078 --> 01:23:08,622
Who is JS and what does she do to Dean?

1133
01:23:08,747 --> 01:23:11,708
- Annie...
- Tell me everything. Be honest with me.

1134
01:23:11,834 --> 01:23:14,920
Annie, uh... That's my underwear.

1135
01:23:16,588 --> 01:23:19,883
- What?
- I don't mean I wear it or anything.

1136
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:22,719
- It belongs to a girlfriend.
- What about Gertie?

1137
01:23:22,845 --> 01:23:26,640
I strayed. See, I got lucky
with this phone-sex girl one night.

1138
01:23:26,765 --> 01:23:29,435
I found one that accepted
personal cheques and...

1139
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:33,564
You see, I don't have a back seat
in my truck so I... I used yours.

1140
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:36,817
Dean doesn't want you to tell Gert,
so he's covering for me.

1141
01:23:36,942 --> 01:23:40,279
- What are you talking about?
- I confessed. The jig is up.

1142
01:23:40,404 --> 01:23:43,198
The jig <i>is</i> up!
I'm finally trying to tell her the truth.

1143
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:48,454
I just did. See, I didn't get the reputation
for being Bad Billy Pratt by accident.

1144
01:23:48,579 --> 01:23:50,873
Annie, I'm sorry.

1145
01:23:50,998 --> 01:23:53,041
I got horny.

1146
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:56,086
- Do you hate me?
- Oh, no, I don't hate you.

1147
01:23:56,754 --> 01:24:00,716
- I'm glad you're bad, Billy Pratt.
- Biggest load of bullshit I've seen.

1148
01:24:00,841 --> 01:24:05,721
Honey, honey. Phone-for-sex girls
don't come to your truck, honey. They...

1149
01:24:05,846 --> 01:24:09,475
No, stop trying to cover for him, sweetie.
Let's just forget it.

1150
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,562
Pretty expensive panties.
You can have these back.

1151
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:16,190
That girl must have more than one phone.

1152
01:24:17,775 --> 01:24:19,610
Pretty good, huh?

1153
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:23,113
You did this to protect your ass
because you faked my pictures?

1154
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:27,409
No, I did it to protect <i>your</i> ass, OK?
You belong with her.

1155
01:24:47,054 --> 01:24:49,098
Oh, cute.

1156
01:24:49,223 --> 01:24:52,226
Mom! Help, he has my hand.

1157
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:55,646
Why do you stick your hands
in people's mouths, anyway?

1158
01:24:55,771 --> 01:24:57,898
Let's go. Let's go to another one.

1159
01:25:08,534 --> 01:25:11,328
I have been calling all over Elk Cove.

1160
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:16,625
No, no. Don't worry. No, no.
I will try Portland for a limousine.

1161
01:25:18,043 --> 01:25:20,921
I really don't have anything
to say except that, uh...

1162
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:25,801
there would be no Wonders of the World
miniature golf course if it wasn't for

1163
01:25:25,926 --> 01:25:29,138
the imagination
and the creativity of one woman.

1164
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:33,267
That's my Annie.
Annie, you wanna come up here?

1165
01:25:38,689 --> 01:25:41,942
I love you, Annie.
I want you to be with me always.

1166
01:25:56,749 --> 01:25:59,585
Everybody, play ball!

1167
01:26:02,588 --> 01:26:04,590
Let's go clean up.

1168
01:26:37,623 --> 01:26:41,710
- Hey, Dad! Whose car is that?
- Maybe it's a rich relative.

1169
01:26:41,835 --> 01:26:46,757
- Sure, it's Daddy Warbucks!
- Maybe we won the lottery.

1170
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:10,322
Hi, Grant!
I just have to put these in some water.

1171
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:29,299
Grant? Is that you?

1172
01:27:34,805 --> 01:27:37,266
Yes.

1173
01:27:37,391 --> 01:27:40,602
Yes, you're Grant Stayton III.

1174
01:27:42,688 --> 01:27:44,815
I remember!

1175
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:48,527
I remember. I'm Joanna Stayton.

1176
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:55,325
Ooh! Dean, I'm cured.

1177
01:27:55,451 --> 01:27:57,494
I can remember again.

1178
01:27:58,203 --> 01:27:59,872
Oh, God!

1179
01:27:59,997 --> 01:28:03,500
You can't imagine how terrible it is
not to know who you are.

1180
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:07,921
The doctor said that my mind would
come back suddenly and he was right.

1181
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:11,884
I saw you, I walked past you into the
house and poof! My memory came back.

1182
01:28:12,009 --> 01:28:15,387
Ask me anything.
Ask me about my childhood in New York.

1183
01:28:15,512 --> 01:28:17,806
Uh, about my mom. Her name is Edith.

1184
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,933
About my money. Money!

1185
01:28:20,059 --> 01:28:23,645
I have money! I have lots of money!
I even have some in Switzerland!

1186
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:25,814
- Switzerland?
- See how I know me?

1187
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:28,525
Oh, God, this is
the happiest day of my life!

1188
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,195
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for bringing me here

1189
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,822
and making me a wife and a mother and...

1190
01:28:33,947 --> 01:28:35,991
Why did you do that?

1191
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:42,164
Why...?

1192
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:44,333
I know why.

1193
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:48,962
You're that sweaty carpenter
who hates me.

1194
01:28:55,344 --> 01:28:58,347
And these are your children,
and you made me

1195
01:28:59,556 --> 01:29:01,767
believe that...

1196
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:09,775
Oh, God...

1197
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:13,695
You tricked me.

1198
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,324
You used me.

1199
01:29:21,578 --> 01:29:23,622
Say something.

1200
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:29,253
- Annie, it just started out...
- My name is not Annie.

1201
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:33,674
And I don't belong with you.

1202
01:29:35,717 --> 01:29:37,761
And I don't belong with them.

1203
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:42,391
I have to... get my things.

1204
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:51,650
Don't get any ideas. I brought Olaf.

1205
01:29:51,775 --> 01:29:53,152
Olaf!

1206
01:29:57,156 --> 01:29:59,116
I think we can take Olaf.

1207
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,176
I won't have...

1208
01:30:20,095 --> 01:30:22,473
There's nothing inside that's mine.

1209
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:35,360
Joanna, for whatever it's worth,

1210
01:30:36,862 --> 01:30:38,113
thank you.

1211
01:30:50,876 --> 01:30:52,920
Come on, dear.

1212
01:30:56,548 --> 01:30:58,842
We'll get you out of these clothes.

1213
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:23,367
- Mom, wait!
- Mom!

1214
01:31:23,492 --> 01:31:26,286
- Mom!
- Mom, come back!

1215
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,095
- You said moms don't leave!
- Get!

1216
01:31:59,361 --> 01:32:01,655
We should have told her, Dad.

1217
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,824
She just would have left sooner.

1218
01:32:05,325 --> 01:32:07,369
Come on.

1219
01:32:30,392 --> 01:32:32,436
Welcome back, Mrs Stayton.

1220
01:33:17,815 --> 01:33:21,777
Dr Korman, will she ever again
be the debutante I raised?

1221
01:33:21,902 --> 01:33:25,739
- Will she be one of us?
- Joanna wants to rediscover her old self.

1222
01:33:26,323 --> 01:33:28,700
Her memory's almost
completely restored.

1223
01:33:28,826 --> 01:33:31,370
She even recalled the session
where I wrote this.

1224
01:33:31,495 --> 01:33:35,332
D I love you madly
though you treat me badly...

1225
01:33:35,457 --> 01:33:37,835
Dr Korman! Please!

1226
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,922
We need analysis, not "Moon River"!
I want my wife back.

1227
01:33:42,047 --> 01:33:45,592
Joanna knows who she is.
And she's trying to behave that way.

1228
01:33:45,717 --> 01:33:46,802
Happy?

1229
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:49,138
Good evening, madam.

1230
01:33:49,263 --> 01:33:53,350
- Ah, my darling Joanna.
- You look radiant, Jo-Jo.

1231
01:33:53,475 --> 01:33:57,062
Oh, please don't call me that.
I feel like a Pomeranian.

1232
01:33:57,187 --> 01:34:00,232
You liked being called Jo-Jo.
It was diddums you hated.

1233
01:34:00,357 --> 01:34:05,154
Mother, why does Dr Korman have to be
here? I feel self-conscious enough as it is.

1234
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,158
Oh, sweetie. Just indulge Mommy, hm?

1235
01:34:09,283 --> 01:34:12,286
Come along, now. Sit, sit, sit.

1236
01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:14,455
Andrew, I'm sitting.

1237
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:19,877
Now, Mrs Mintz.

1238
01:34:20,627 --> 01:34:25,215
Dr Korman knows you so well, dear,
and he only wants to help.

1239
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:28,469
- Champagne, madam.
- Ah, thank you, Andrew.

1240
01:34:30,387 --> 01:34:33,265
- Andrew, I'd love a beer.
- A beer?

1241
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:37,895
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- Nothing is ever wrong.

1242
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:42,816
Actually, I really don't see the harm
in accommodating her wishes, Andrew.

1243
01:34:44,735 --> 01:34:48,572
- Cigarette, darling?
- I don't smoke, Mother. Do I?

1244
01:34:48,697 --> 01:34:50,991
Of course you smoke.
You've always smoked.

1245
01:34:51,116 --> 01:34:53,660
- I smoke.
- Why don't we all smoke?

1246
01:34:54,536 --> 01:34:58,123
Why do I have to smoke? I've never
smoked. I get sick when I smoke.

1247
01:34:58,248 --> 01:35:00,959
Why does everyone try to make me
do what I don't want to do?

1248
01:35:01,085 --> 01:35:04,588
Grant, we are not interested
in <i>your</i> therapy.

1249
01:35:04,713 --> 01:35:09,468
I had my nervous breakdown and
I didn't have therapy. I never had therapy!

1250
01:35:10,594 --> 01:35:13,180
- Mother, would you like some?
- I'd love some.

1251
01:35:13,305 --> 01:35:16,725
Put that down! Good God, Joanna!
We have servants for that.

1252
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:18,852
Now, really, this is going too far.

1253
01:35:18,977 --> 01:35:22,356
Joanna, what motivated you
to rise and go get the serving tray?

1254
01:35:23,982 --> 01:35:26,735
Well, I thought you might be hungry.

1255
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,613
- That's excellent.
- What's excellent about it?

1256
01:35:29,738 --> 01:35:33,325
- I was hungry.
- Your beer, madam.

1257
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:36,286
Who cares that you were hungry!
She became a waitress!

1258
01:35:36,412 --> 01:35:38,872
- My daughter's a waitress?!
- Hold it.

1259
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:43,335
Mm!

1260
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:45,504
Good stuff.

1261
01:35:53,095 --> 01:35:55,931
I'll stay an extra few days, yes.

1262
01:36:07,234 --> 01:36:09,653
- They won't come in.
- Shit.

1263
01:36:17,244 --> 01:36:19,413
Spaghettio Surprise.

1264
01:36:27,588 --> 01:36:30,424
- What's goin' on?
- We're gettin' Mom back.

1265
01:36:30,549 --> 01:36:33,886
- We miss her.
- Yeah, she cuts the crusts off the bread.

1266
01:36:34,011 --> 01:36:37,473
She doesn't take any of my shit either.
I need discipline.

1267
01:36:37,598 --> 01:36:39,141
We got $3.04.

1268
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:42,311
We're gonna rent a fishing boat
and get her back.

1269
01:36:42,436 --> 01:36:45,981
No fishing boat's gonna catch a yacht,
especially at that price.

1270
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:50,527
- Maybe she'll decide to come back.
- Dumbo, she's on her way to New York!

1271
01:36:50,652 --> 01:36:54,198
- This is a job for Dr Death.
- Yeah, Dr Death could do it!

1272
01:36:54,323 --> 01:36:56,366
We gotta do somethin'. Right, Dad?

1273
01:36:56,492 --> 01:36:58,202
Wrong!

1274
01:36:58,327 --> 01:37:00,370
Now, she's gone, guys.

1275
01:37:00,496 --> 01:37:02,164
She hates me!

1276
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:07,795
She's got her rich husband back...
and her rich life and that's the end of it.

1277
01:37:30,984 --> 01:37:33,779
I love the sound of the ocean.

1278
01:37:34,822 --> 01:37:37,699
Hallo-ooo!

1279
01:37:41,286 --> 01:37:42,955
Tofutti.

1280
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,833
Ah, Tofutti, where are you
when I need you?

1281
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:50,879
Tofutti Klein-ein-ein-ein...

1282
01:37:51,004 --> 01:37:53,048
All together. And!

1283
01:37:53,215 --> 01:37:56,009
Lick, shake, lick.

1284
01:37:56,468 --> 01:37:57,636
Drink!

1285
01:37:59,054 --> 01:38:01,265
Suck!

1286
01:38:02,808 --> 01:38:05,894
- You sucked first!
- No, I didn't! I did it right!

1287
01:38:06,937 --> 01:38:09,231
- Danger watch! Gotta go! Let's go!
- Oh, yes.

1288
01:38:10,107 --> 01:38:11,692
Croissants in the morning!

1289
01:38:11,817 --> 01:38:15,279
- Dinner was wonderful.
- <i>Merci beaucoup. Bonne nuit</i>.

1290
01:38:15,404 --> 01:38:18,115
You best not lose these again, madam.

1291
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,659
- Again?
- With my apologies, madam.

1292
01:38:20,784 --> 01:38:24,747
"Andrew! I seem to have lost
my ruby earrings somewhere between...

1293
01:38:24,872 --> 01:38:28,959
...<i>6</i>4th... and <i>6</i>8th Streets."

1294
01:38:29,084 --> 01:38:30,878
"Find them!"

1295
01:38:31,962 --> 01:38:36,675
I've behaved so badly. I don't know
how you put up with me for so long.

1296
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,262
You've done so many
wonderful things for me

1297
01:38:40,387 --> 01:38:42,848
and I've never even once said thank you.

1298
01:38:44,349 --> 01:38:46,393
I'm sorry.

1299
01:38:48,979 --> 01:38:51,023
Apology accepted, ma'am.

1300
01:38:52,357 --> 01:38:55,527
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think they're right?

1301
01:38:55,986 --> 01:38:58,238
Oh, no, madam. Oh, no.

1302
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:03,077
Most of us... go through life
with blinders on, madam,

1303
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:08,040
knowing only that one little station
to which we were born.

1304
01:39:08,165 --> 01:39:11,710
But you, madam, on the other hand,
have had the rare privilege

1305
01:39:11,835 --> 01:39:15,172
of escaping your bonds for just a spell

1306
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:19,426
to see life from an entirely
new perspective.

1307
01:39:20,636 --> 01:39:25,808
How you choose to use that information,
madam, is entirely up to you.

1308
01:39:46,078 --> 01:39:48,372
- Captain Karl?
- Yes, ma'am.

1309
01:39:48,497 --> 01:39:51,375
- We've never really had time to talk.
- No, we haven't.

1310
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,544
Well, there's no time now.

1311
01:39:54,336 --> 01:39:56,839
- What are you doing?
- Turning the boat around.

1312
01:39:56,964 --> 01:39:59,842
- Why?
- I'm going home.

1313
01:39:59,967 --> 01:40:02,720
You're turning that wheel too fast.

1314
01:40:24,324 --> 01:40:28,078
Captain Karl! Why is the land
on the wrong side of the yacht?

1315
01:40:30,539 --> 01:40:34,084
Oh, she did?
Well, she's gone too far this time.

1316
01:40:34,209 --> 01:40:36,503
She thinks she's dealing with an idiot!

1317
01:40:41,425 --> 01:40:43,886
So we're heading back
to the jungles of Oregon!

1318
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:46,305
- I want to go back, Grant.
- To him?

1319
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:48,474
Yes. I'm sorry.

1320
01:40:49,892 --> 01:40:53,270
You haven't begun to be sorry,
you hillbilly harlot!

1321
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:57,066
Captain Karl, go below with the crew.
I'm taking over.

1322
01:40:57,191 --> 01:40:59,234
Andrew, go get Dr Korman! Go!

1323
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:01,528
- Get out of my way, Karl!
- But, sir!

1324
01:41:01,653 --> 01:41:03,655
Now I'm in charge!

1325
01:41:03,781 --> 01:41:07,618
We're coming about... at full speed ahead!

1326
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:27,054
- Who is it?
- Dr Death. Let's go.

1327
01:41:27,179 --> 01:41:29,223
We're gonna go get her!

1328
01:41:29,348 --> 01:41:31,725
Come on! Billy's friends'll help us!

1329
01:41:40,943 --> 01:41:43,904
- I hope I don't get court-martialled.
- Yeah, I owe you.

1330
01:41:44,488 --> 01:41:48,033
- Anything in the manual?
- Not about pulling alongside a ship

1331
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:50,536
and telling a passenger
you love them, sir.

1332
01:41:50,661 --> 01:41:53,664
Put your nose in the manual
and find something, Lucas!

1333
01:41:54,248 --> 01:41:56,792
Whatever you do,
I'm getting off at the next port.

1334
01:41:56,917 --> 01:41:59,670
Don't be ridiculous.
<i>Nobody</i> leaves a Stayton.

1335
01:41:59,795 --> 01:42:02,965
I don't love you any more.
Please try and understand that.

1336
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:05,134
What has love got to do with marriage?

1337
01:42:07,261 --> 01:42:10,681
You'd actually prefer living in squalor
with that cave dweller!

1338
01:42:13,934 --> 01:42:16,729
They should have kept you
in the hospital psycho ward!

1339
01:42:18,689 --> 01:42:20,941
What did you say?

1340
01:42:21,066 --> 01:42:23,402
How did you know that?

1341
01:42:23,902 --> 01:42:25,946
You left me there, didn't you?

1342
01:42:28,282 --> 01:42:30,409
You snake!

1343
01:42:31,577 --> 01:42:33,704
How could you do that?

1344
01:42:33,829 --> 01:42:37,082
How could you be such a slime?

1345
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:41,295
Call me all the names you want,
but many women adore me!

1346
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,964
Do you wanna know what I was doing?
I'll tell you.

1347
01:42:44,089 --> 01:42:47,426
I was whacking the donkey
with painted ladies. They loved me!

1348
01:42:47,926 --> 01:42:50,345
Yes! I did leave you.

1349
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:53,724
There! Now I've confessed. So what?

1350
01:42:53,849 --> 01:42:57,102
We're at sea. And I'm a god at sea!

1351
01:43:01,106 --> 01:43:04,026
Nine o'clock in the morning.
This better be good.

1352
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:06,904
Doctor, Grant's having
another nervous breakdown.

1353
01:43:07,029 --> 01:43:10,491
- He thinks he's God. Keep him busy.
- All right.

1354
01:43:10,616 --> 01:43:13,118
- Morning, Grant.
- Korman, my wife is insane.

1355
01:43:13,243 --> 01:43:15,871
- Do we have a straitjacket?
- I always carry one.

1356
01:43:15,996 --> 01:43:17,748
Good! Put her in it!

1357
01:43:20,042 --> 01:43:23,128
You're overwrought, Grant.
I want you to take a Valium.

1358
01:43:23,253 --> 01:43:25,422
Here, take one of mine.

1359
01:43:26,298 --> 01:43:28,592
- Is Nino here?
- Nino on break.

1360
01:43:28,717 --> 01:43:31,720
I have to stop the boat.
My husband's a little bit crazy...

1361
01:43:31,845 --> 01:43:34,223
- The captain stop the boat.
- I'm the captain!

1362
01:43:34,348 --> 01:43:37,434
No, please don't salute!
I have to find a red button...

1363
01:43:39,895 --> 01:43:41,939
Vessel sighted straight ahead, sir!

1364
01:43:42,064 --> 01:43:45,401
- Identify.
- There's a fat guy in my way, sir.

1365
01:43:45,526 --> 01:43:48,737
Who you callin' fat, you little weasel!
Come here!

1366
01:43:50,406 --> 01:43:52,699
Where's the thing? I need the red...

1367
01:43:52,825 --> 01:43:55,577
- Here! Here it is!
- No, please!

1368
01:43:58,747 --> 01:44:00,791
- The boat stopped.
- Yes, it stopped!

1369
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:04,294
- I need to get it turned around.
- Nino on the break.

1370
01:44:12,636 --> 01:44:14,680
He's here!

1371
01:44:15,139 --> 01:44:18,559
He's here! That's him!

1372
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:26,692
Stop that boat immediately
and let me get my mom!

1373
01:44:27,818 --> 01:44:29,737
- <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>
- Pee Wee Herman.

1374
01:44:29,862 --> 01:44:34,283
- <i>Qui est-ce?</i>
- <i>Maman! Qu'est-ce qu'on mange ce soir?</i>

1375
01:44:34,408 --> 01:44:36,910
<i>Come in, Immaculata</i>.

1376
01:44:37,327 --> 01:44:40,330
- He's here!
- There's mutiny afoot.

1377
01:44:46,503 --> 01:44:50,758
She's at the bottom of this mutiny.
I'm gonna rid myself of this albatross.

1378
01:45:00,059 --> 01:45:02,102
He's here!

1379
01:45:09,068 --> 01:45:12,321
- Go back to New York, Dr Korman.
- Really? Thank you.

1380
01:45:12,446 --> 01:45:14,490
- Dean!
- Madam! The ship has stopped.

1381
01:45:14,615 --> 01:45:16,658
What happened? Did he strike you?

1382
01:45:16,784 --> 01:45:20,037
- Did he make you do something?
- No! Everything's wonderful.

1383
01:45:20,162 --> 01:45:24,041
- Message over the radio, sir.
- Annie! Ha-ha!

1384
01:45:24,166 --> 01:45:27,795
Looks like the fun's over. We've got some
salmon poachers fishing in illegal waters.

1385
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,922
That takes precedence
over your friend's love life.

1386
01:45:30,047 --> 01:45:32,424
- Come about!
- Son, no more radio.

1387
01:45:32,549 --> 01:45:35,594
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a... Hey!

1388
01:45:35,719 --> 01:45:38,263
- Billy, what's goin' on?
- We're turnin' round.

1389
01:45:38,389 --> 01:45:40,391
They're going after salmon poachers.

1390
01:45:40,516 --> 01:45:44,895
He's leaving. Where's he going?

1391
01:45:57,241 --> 01:46:00,828
- Catarina!
- Arturo!

1392
01:46:07,543 --> 01:46:09,420
I'm coming!

1393
01:46:09,545 --> 01:46:13,716
- Man overboard!
- Shit! Sound the horn.

1394
01:46:13,841 --> 01:46:17,177
Coming about again, Czapowskyj.

1395
01:46:17,302 --> 01:46:19,888
Annie!

1396
01:46:20,013 --> 01:46:22,349
Oh, no, madam. I cannot let you do this!

1397
01:46:22,474 --> 01:46:25,144
- What?
- Not without a lifejacket.

1398
01:46:25,853 --> 01:46:28,105
Dean! I'm coming!

1399
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:31,567
Madam, you really should
play a little hard to get.

1400
01:46:31,692 --> 01:46:33,944
Tell my mother I'll call her!

1401
01:46:36,071 --> 01:46:40,242
Woman overboard!
She's wearing an evening dress, sir.

1402
01:46:40,367 --> 01:46:43,162
Get those kids out of the rescue boat.
Let's go!

1403
01:46:43,287 --> 01:46:45,789
My mom's out there! Let me...

1404
01:46:45,914 --> 01:46:48,041
Halt! You treasonous tramp!

1405
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:51,086
Conspiring with the enemy
at sea is mutiny!

1406
01:46:51,837 --> 01:46:53,338
Pull!

1407
01:46:57,634 --> 01:46:59,678
<i>Another man overboard!</i>

1408
01:47:00,179 --> 01:47:02,181
I am giving my notice, sir!

1409
01:47:12,566 --> 01:47:16,445
- Annie!
- Oh, Dean!

1410
01:47:21,533 --> 01:47:23,160
Annie!

1411
01:47:41,136 --> 01:47:44,098
I love you! I'll never leave you again!

1412
01:47:44,223 --> 01:47:47,476
I'll never let you go!
You're my Annie. You always will be.

1413
01:47:48,143 --> 01:47:50,729
Man overboard
is kissing woman overboard.

1414
01:47:51,563 --> 01:47:53,816
Our rescue boat is starboard.

1415
01:47:54,358 --> 01:47:57,653
The guy with the arrows
is being pulled in at port.

1416
01:47:57,778 --> 01:48:00,406
It's a helluva day at sea, sir.

1417
01:48:02,449 --> 01:48:06,578
- I can't believe you did it.
- Oh, I saw you jump so I jumped.

1418
01:48:06,703 --> 01:48:08,747
No, I don't mean that.

1419
01:48:08,872 --> 01:48:11,417
I can't believe
you gave all that up just for me.

1420
01:48:11,542 --> 01:48:13,877
- I didn't.
- What do... What do you mean?

1421
01:48:14,002 --> 01:48:16,046
Well, the truth is that it's mine.

1422
01:48:16,171 --> 01:48:18,882
The boat, the money, everything.
It's all mine.

1423
01:48:19,007 --> 01:48:21,885
Dean! Dean, it's OK!

1424
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,064
Oh! Did you tell 'em?

1425
01:48:34,189 --> 01:48:36,066
Yeah.

1426
01:48:36,191 --> 01:48:39,445
- They're making out their Christmas lists.
- Oh, already?

1427
01:48:40,154 --> 01:48:42,281
How do you spell Porsche?

1428
01:48:44,491 --> 01:48:46,535
They got me thinking, though.

1429
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:51,206
What can I possibly give you, ever,
that you don't already have?

1430
01:48:58,505 --> 01:49:00,549
A little girl.

1431
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:14,104
# <i>Different people</i>
