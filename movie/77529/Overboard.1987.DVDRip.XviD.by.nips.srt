Dock five, the <i>Immaculata?</i>

2
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,995
It's over there!

3
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,076
Oh!

4
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,790
I cannot, I repeat, cannot

5
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,754
sit in this cesspool by the sea
with nothing to do.

6
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,158
So, while you repair your silly boat
engines, I will do some remodelling.

7
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,239
- I've sent for a carpenter.
- Whatever, diddums. I'm shooting skeet.

8
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,357
Hello!

9
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,717
Mr Stayton? Anybody home?

10
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,834
- Hello!
- State your purpose!

11
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,191
- Nice-looking Wetherby you got.
- It's a very expensive gun.

12
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
- I have lots and lots of them.
- Somebody call for a carpenter?

13
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,112
That's my wife's department.

14
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,708
Could you tell me
where your wife might... be?

15
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,228
You're the carpenter?

16
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,870
Yeah. Dean Proffitt.

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,956
You're late.

18
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,430
- References?
- Well, no, not really.

19
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,835
You see, I just moved up to this area...

20
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,350
Hey, I've been doing this kind
of shit - work - for years.

21
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,233
This is... This is just beautiful. Wow!

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,108
- Try not to touch anything.
- Oh, I won't.

23
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,275
Andrew will keep an eye on you.

24
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,359
Maybe you'd like to take fingerprints
before I get started.

25
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,436
I was just... kidding.

26
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,319
Don't walk so close to me!

27
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,192
OK! Where's your problem?

28
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,038
- My closet.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,036
In here.

30
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,598
Now, you can see
how inadequate this all is.

31
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,359
I need new shoe racks for my shoes.

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,916
Uh, excuse me. I was told that
this was some kind of an emergency.

33
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,235
It is.

34
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,430
And I need drawers for my lingerie.

35
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,473
I can't keep entering
these boxes all the time.

36
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,033
Hello?

37
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,716
Uh... Hey, I'm sorry. I understand now.
You want me to remodel your closet.

38
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,109
Isn't that what I've been explaining
in some detail?

39
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,276
Is English your second language?

40
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,276
What is that odour?

41
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,396
I don't smell anything.

42
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,553
Madam.

43
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,271
Well! I almost had to wait.

44
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,911
I got an idea for a shoe rack
right in here maybe, huh?

45
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,714
What <i>is</i> this gelatinous muck?!

46
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,432
Andrew, when I tell you to pack staples,

47
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,953
must I specify that you are to pack
good caviar and not this $1.99 fish bait!

48
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,629
- Yes, madam.
- Caviar should be round and hard

49
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,910
and of adequate size.

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,274
And it should burst in your mouth
at <i>precisely</i> the right moment.

51
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,515
Yes, madam.

52
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,437
- Carpenter!
- Yeah?

53
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,791
You have exactly 48 hours.
I suggest you get started.

54
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,392
- Throw that out.
- Yes, madam.

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,356
Watch him.

56
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,074
<i>Mais oui! Bien sur!</i>

57
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,309
<i>Oui?</i>

58
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,795
<i>Ecoutez, Jean-Jacques</i>.
<i>Je vous telephone</i>...

59
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,593
Oh, boy. She is really something!

60
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,632
I know it will cost me,
but it's the cutest little painting.

61
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,752
I simply must have it.
You'll do the bidding for me?

62
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,393
But of course(!)

63
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,432
- Bid 1,700,000.
- Shit!

64
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,872
Grant, I'm on the phone!

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,037
I can't hear you, tea rose!
I'm shooting skeet!

66
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,709
- Pull!
- Pull!

67
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,432
Firing!

68
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,915
Hello.

69
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,597
Forks were invented so man
could at least make a pretence

70
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,474
- of separating himself from the apes.
- So were thumbs.

71
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,671
- What did you say?
- Nothin'. Just... my stomach.

72
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,749
Well, try to control your bodily noises
so I can hear myself think!

73
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,754
<i>And another</i>
<i>Oregon good morning to you</i>.

74
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,155
<i>Wilbur Budd here with some local items</i>.

75
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,592
<i>The Fraga Feed and Fertilizer folks</i>
<i>are hiring people to shovel the stuff</i>.

76
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,157
<i>Oh, women are welcome, too. There's</i>
<i>no chauvinism in the manure business</i>.

77
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,917
These gnats keep landing
on my wet nail polish.

78
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,033
I guess I'm supposed to walk around with
their little corpses stuck to my fingers.

79
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,355
- Joanna, please!
- It's easy for you to say!

80
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,359
You don't have to sit out here in the brine
with your perm frizzing to oblivion.

81
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,357
I look like a bushman.

82
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,552
Why don't you go inside
and get out of the sea air?

83
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,912
Because that Elk Snout mountain man
is still working on my closet.

84
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,996
He's sweating all over the place.

85
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,076
I doubt if he's even housebroken.

86
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,112
- Oh, I think they housebreak each other...
- Ssh!

87
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,596
- What?
- He's listening.

88
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,711
- Who?
- That carpenter.

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,912
He's been hanging on our every word
for the last two days.

90
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,873
It's your project, Joanna. You deal with it.

91
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,194
- Come along, men.
- The engines are ready, sir.

92
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,276
Well, let's get going.

93
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,796
I've finished, madam.
Shall I put your jewellery back on you?

94
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,955
No.

95
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,551
I'm still tacky.

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,359
Keep quiet for ten more minutes, collect
the money and get the hell outta here.

97
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,675
Well! Are we amusing you?

98
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,155
- What... is this?
- Uh, well, I'm done. I'm finished.

99
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,555
- Uh... What do you think?
- What is it?

100
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,797
Well, it's a shoe rack... with a twist.
Uh... You ready?

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,675
Just turn the crank here, those drop back,
these split. Gives you twice the space...

102
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,712
Stop boring me with your absurdities.
What's it made of?

103
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,796
It's called wood. It's oak.

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,195
Oak. An oak closet?

105
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,197
Huh! Why am I even amazed?

106
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,515
I don't know. Why are you amazed?

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,430
One would think you would know closets
are made of cedar. If not, we get moths.

108
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,269
Well, lady, there's not a real big
moth problem off the Pacific coast.

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,676
But if you want one out of cedar,
that's fine. I'll start all over.

110
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,395
I just have to tell ya that's gonna
more than double my estimate.

111
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,116
- What do you mean?
- I've already done this out of oak, so...

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,279
- I'm not paying for your mistake!
- I'm not just gonna eat it on this deal.

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,595
Why not?
You've eaten everything else here.

114
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,790
And you will eat it
because I wanted cedar!

115
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,559
You may have <i>wanted</i> cedar,
but you didn't <i>ask</i> for it.

116
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,513
The entire civilised world
knows closets are made of cedar!

117
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,791
In Elk Snout,
we don't know about them closets!

118
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,913
Nor bathrooms, neither! Shit, woman!
You're lucky I <i>am</i> housebroke!

119
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,758
- You were listening.
- Well, it was kinda hard to avoid.

120
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,190
- You can avoid it now - you're fired!
- You're unbelievable!

121
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,869
That's fine with me!
Just pay me the money you owe me.

122
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,630
- The job was not done to my satisfaction!
- I got news for you, lady!

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,149
No job will ever be done
to your satisfaction!

124
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,236
That's quite enough! Now, just get out!

125
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,033
No problem! Pay me the <i>6</i>00 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone!

126
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,116
Captain Karl! Start up the engine!

127
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,911
You know what your problem is? Huh?

128
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,271
You're so goddamn bored,
you gotta invent things to bitch about.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,312
You haven't got a single thing to do
except for your hair.

130
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,192
Yeah! The closet was fine!

131
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,357
You just needed somethin'
to take up your useless, empty,

132
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,712
nail-polishing, toe-polishing,
rich-bitch, sun tanning days!

133
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,836
- Don't touch me!
- What?

134
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,915
Hey, lady.

135
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,909
I may be hard up, but I am not that
hard up. And I'm not goin' anywhere...

136
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,516
Hey!

137
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,116
- Damn you!
- Man overboard!

138
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,196
I'll get you for this, you...

139
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,756
Not my tool belt! You owe me <i>6</i>00 bucks!

140
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,879
- Keep going!
- As you wish.

141
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,638
If I ever get you, lady, you're dead meat!
You got that?

142
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,716
No, don't throw that!

143
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,519
I'm not bored! I'm quite happy!

144
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,596
Everyone wants to be me!

145
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,993
You come back here!

146
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,071
I lost all my tools.

147
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,192
I'll loan you some tools.
We'll get you some part-time work.

148
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,118
I need a steady job.
What about that night-time thing?

149
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,358
I'm working on it. Listen, pretty soon,
we'll get that miniature golf course deal.

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,436
If I can hang on that long.

151
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,556
He called you a what?

152
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,797
Joanna, why are you so upset?

153
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,710
Why in the world do you care what some
carpenter from Elk Snout thinks of you?

154
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,196
I'm sure I'm just premenstrual.

155
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,279
Then you must go right back to bed
for at least two days.

156
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,356
Inga, you don't shove the food
down Shiitake's throat.

157
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,439
You place it on her tongue.
Don't they have dogs in Sweden?

158
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,836
Grant mentioned having a baby again.

159
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,716
<i>What should I do?</i>

160
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,196
<i>Darling, if you have a baby,</i>

161
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,276
you won't be the baby any more.

162
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,314
True.

163
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,352
<i>Well, I must go. Bye-bye, Mommy</i>.

164
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,072
Bye-bye, sweetie.

165
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,876
I'm not a bitch.

166
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,194
Andrew!
Are you going to bring me my lemon

167
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,993
or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

168
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,234
Hey, guys, I'm home!

169
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,469
Stay away, you wolves! No! Shoo!

170
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,556
Bad dogs! Go away!

171
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,717
Buster! Jackson! Get back inside!

172
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,196
- Are you Mr Proffitt?
- Yeah!

173
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,915
You look like the morning after
Halloween. Probably had a day like I did.

174
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,316
- What happened to you?
- Monday is their first day of school

175
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,718
and I came here to welcome your family.
And what do I get in return?

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,435
- I get toilet-papered by your children!
- They're just playin' around!

177
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,917
Just playin' around? They were about
to douse the toilet paper with gasoline

178
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,996
- and strike...
- Wait, wait! Stop.

179
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,270
- Greg and Charlie. Twins, right?
- Yeah.

180
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,518
They're having this arson period. They
don't know this, but I'm ahead of them.

181
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,870
I got two fire extinguishers ready to go.

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,355
- I didn't catch your name.
- Adele Burbridge.

183
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,675
- Nice to meet you.
- Principal of the Elk Cove school.

184
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,634
- Your children are monsters!
- You won't think that once you know 'em!

185
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,356
- Where is Mrs Proffitt during all of this?
- She died three years ago.

186
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,428
Mr Proffitt, your children are totally
lacking in parental supervision.

187
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,632
Hey, you don't have to tell <i>me</i>
these kids are lucky.

188
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,116
Fine. You can joke all you want,
but I am serious about this.

189
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,950
If you don't do something,
I am going to notify the proper authorities.

190
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,277
I have had baby-sitters in here
by the dozen, but...

191
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,356
I'm... I'm kinda low on cash right now.

192
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,519
I'm new in town, but if I get a chance
I'll hire a housekeeper, all right?

193
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,518
I'll believe it when I see it.
Good day, Mr Proffitt!

194
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,236
I'm a good father!

195
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,516
Ah, what do you know?

196
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,154
Joanna, I want you tonight.

197
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,953
How can you have your period
every week?!

198
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,870
<i>You can stow away with the rich</i>
<i>and famous to exotic ports of call</i>...

199
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,349
Must you watch that thing incessantly?

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,951
Yes, I must. It has a tawdry escapist
quality that soothes my nerves.

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,470
What you have to escape from,
I can't possibly imagine.

202
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,392
Grant! I left my wedding ring on the deck.

203
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,876
- Well, what can <i>I</i> do?
- Go and get it.

204
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,436
- It's after midnight!
- I don't care what time it is. I want it now!

205
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,677
I want to see who's in the top ten yachts.

206
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,234
- I'll get it!
- OK.

207
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,712
<i>A countdown to the world's</i>
<i>ten best luxury yachts</i>.

208
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,752
<i>This is the big league of the seven seas</i>.

<i>a 167-foot Saudi-owned dreamboat,</i>
<i>docked in Tahiti</i>.

212

<i>Number nine, the 230</i>...

213
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,436
Andrew!

214
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,999
Grant!

215
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,117
Oh, my hair!

216
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,559
Help!

217
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,598
Grant! Help!

218
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,191
Stop! You idiots!

219
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,192
Another Oregon good morning to you!
This is Wilbur Budd here at KRAB,

220
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,029
the family station,
run by me and my family.

221
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,039
Sorry to interrupt the movie, but we got
some excitement in Tillamook County.

222
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,789
I've got a bulletin for the eyewitness,
on-the-spot KRAB newsroom.

223
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,036
It seems a mystery woman
was picked up

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,197
by the Elk Cove garbage scow
shortly after midnight.

225
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,073
They fished her out of the water
and she's conscious,

226
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,192
but the problem is she seems
to be suffering from amnesia.

227
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,709
She has no recollection of who she is.

228
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,638
<i>My wife Rose is with</i>
<i>the captain of the garbage scow</i>

229
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,591
<i>that picked up the mystery lady</i>.

230
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,551
- <i>Rose?</i>
- Mr Tunatti.

231
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,639
Can you tell us what the woman was like
when you brought her aboard?

232
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,151
Yes. We saw something float in water
like this. Just like that, just like that.

233
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,431
We didn't know it... We bring... on board.

234
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,199
- On board.
- Yes. We say... <i>foca!</i>

235
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,515
Excuse me,
you can't say that on television!

236
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,392
No, no, no, no!

237
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,080
<i>Foca! Foca!</i>
<i>Foca</i> means seal in <i>portugues!</i>

238
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,350
- Oh, I see!
- Seal, seal! So we bring...

239
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,756
- You learn something every day!
- No clothes. Just a little thing.

240
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,078
- <i>There you have it. Thank you, Tunatti</i>.
- <i>Thank you</i>.

241
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,156
<i>Garbage I do for money. For love, I sing</i>.

242
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,669
- <i>In my country, I sing</i>.
- <i>Isn't that interesting?</i>

243
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,475
- <i>We have a Renaissance garbageman</i>.
- <i>We tell stories with our songs</i>.

244
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,352
<i>Thank you, Rose</i>.

245
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,552
<i>Arnie, can we roll that tape now, please?</i>

246
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,113
<i>Now, folks. Here's an interview</i>
<i>we taped earlier at the hospital</i>.

247
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,038
<i>Miss, miss</i>... <i>do you know your name?</i>

248
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,116
<i>Of course I know my name!</i>

249
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,632
<i>It's</i>...

250
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,716
<i>Oh! This is absurd!</i>

251
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,356
<i>I know it! It</i>...

252
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,876
<i>Get that thing out of my face!</i>

253
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,076
<i>What a horrible wig!</i>

254
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,192
You mean to tell me
that I have no medical recourse?

255
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,434
- Can she see us?
- Not unless she's Superwoman.

256
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,429
Well, what do you know? Extend
your brain a teensy little bit, if possible!

257
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,950
You seem to be suffering
from a temporary amnesia,

258
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,119
either from the bump into the garbage
scow or the shock of the cold water.

259
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,708
- How temporary is it?
- Well, we don't know.

260
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,798
Otherwise, you seem to be
in excellent physical shape.

261
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,876
Listen to me, medical people.

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,118
As of now, I have a life history
of a dirty garbage scow

263
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,596
and a breakfast of
extremely runny eggs over easy!

264
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,871
Now I refuse... refuse...

265
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,951
to be incarcerated in this
semi-private room!

266
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,877
You snore!

267
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,468
No efforts are being made
for anyone to locate...

268
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,589
Is that her?

269
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,552
<i>I demand you do something!</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

270
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,035
No! I never saw her before in my life.

271
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,509
Mrs Stayton has decided
to leave me. Let's celebrate!

272
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,639
Now, Miss, uh... X, we have
a comfortable private room for you

273
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,356
where you'll be safer, we'll all be safer,
and you'll be a lot more comfortable.

274
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,790
Well, I'm glad you've <i>finally</i>
come to your senses!

275
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,831
I was prepared to sue you.

276
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,918
I don't know who I am,
but I'm sure I have a lawyer.

277
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,955
- Hey, you about done?
- Yeah! I think I got it fixed.

278
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,958
- Your lunch is on the counter.
- Thanks.

279
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,355
<i>Hi, this is Wilbur Budd</i>.
<i>We got some more</i>

280
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,597
<i>on that amnesia lady story</i>
<i>down there in Elk Grove</i>.

281
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,676
<i>Wanna push in on these, Barry, please?</i>

282
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,156
Uh, I saw some potato chips
around the corner. Could I just...?

283
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,236
OK, one bag!

284
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,354
<i>I said Elk Grove before. You know</i>
<i>I meant Elk Cove. Anything new, honey?</i>

285
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,268
<i>The mystery woman is still suffering</i>
<i>from complete but temporary amnesia</i>.

286
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,871
<i>If you know the identity of this</i>
<i>woman, please contact Elk Cove Hospital</i>.

287
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,992
<i>I'll put up the reward myself</i>.
<i>She's drivin' us crazy</i>.

288
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,156
- <i>Thank you. Back to Wilbur</i>...
- Yo, Dean!

289
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,990
- <i>She's not the nicest person around</i>...
- Look at this!

290
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,590
<i>She made some remarks about</i>
<i>Rose's hair, which I didn't care for</i>.

291
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,632
<i>In any event, there she is</i>
<i>and this is what she looks like</i>.

292
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,273
- That's her.
- Who?

293
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,152
The bitch!

294
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,876
<i>Earlier today, one man arrived on</i>
<i>the scene to make an identification, but</i>...

295
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,912
I can't believe it. He's skippin' out on her.

296
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,679
Course he is! It's his shot at freedom.

297
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,234
We should go and see
if we can get your money back.

298
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,316
- Look, he's gone!
- Not him, her!

299
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,031
She doesn't know who she is. Do you
think she's gonna know who I am?

300
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,917
- Billy, there is a God and he loves me.
- You're not gonna shave your head?

301
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,268
No.

302
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,836
- Dean...
- I gotta go talk to my kids.

303
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,520
I want you to take 'em shopping
at the Salvation Army.

304
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,790
This is illegal! Dean, you're crazy!

305
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,635
I wondered if a woman like that
had a husband.

306
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,275
- Oh, yeah! She does!
- Here's some effects you may recognise.

307
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,435
Oh, yeah.

308
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,109
Nice panties. Some initials here,
she didn't know what they meant. JS.

309
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,835
She wouldn't cos, see,
I bought these for her at a garage sale.

310
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,032
- I bought my wife a garter at a yard sale.
- I bet you did.

311
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,038
- Hey, what else you got in here?
- I got some pictures.

312
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,515
We were gonna wire them,
but now you're here...

313
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,790
Yeah! That's her.

314
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,670
Oh, yeah. That's my little cookie-cutter.

315
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,030
- Quite a beauty!
- She's somethin', isn't she?

316
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,435
You got that right!

317
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,437
Doc. We got a winner.

318
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,273
Annie!

319
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,356
Stop!

320
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,397
I don't recognise this man.

321
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,080
Your wife's had an almost
total loss of memory.

322
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,795
I-I can't believe
she doesn't know her own husband!

323
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,074
This missing-link person
is not my husband!

324
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,475
Oh, Annie, please!

325
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,558
- Annie. Annie.
- Right.

326
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,557
That's not right. That's not my name!

327
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,831
This is completely crazy! Honey, sit down.

328
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,158
Everything's gonna be OK.
Now... I <i>am</i> your husband.

329
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,236
My name is Dean Proffitt.

330
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,436
We've been married for 13 years.

331
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,118
Wait!

332
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,596
I admit I have forgotten numerous things.

333
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,395
But I truly, from the depths of my soul,
do not remember you!

334
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,273
Don't you think
there'd be some spark of recognition?

335
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,551
- We don't know.
- Maybe you'll spark to this!

336
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,355
Ugh! I don't believe this!
He could be some stranger off the street!

337
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,755
Well, he seems to like you
and he's a nice guy.

338
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,393
- He's good-lookin'.
- Clean.

339
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,116
- What's my full name?
- Oh, come on!

340
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,595
- What is it?
- Mrs Annie Proffitt!

341
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,269
- What's my maiden name?
- Annie... Goolihy.

342
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,196
Annie Goolihy?

343
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,550
Where in God's name did I grow up?
Dogpatch?

344
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,595
No, no, not there! Over in Goober, Idaho.
But it's a nuclear waste dump now...

345
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,109
- Where did I meet you?
- Hank's Donut World.

346
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,596
Seattle? You hung out there every night
when you were in the Navy!

347
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,950
- You remember...
- I was in the armed forces?

348
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,435
I've still got your postcards
from Okinawa...

349
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,120
Stop. The Navy?

350
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,673
Oh, come on, honey!

351
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,870
You gotta know! You were in the Navy!

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,675
No, I don't know! I don't know
any of this and I don't know you!

353
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,716
I need some proof!

354
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,516
Stop staring at me!

355
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,156
Eat your chequers!

356
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,308
Look, if it were up to us, we'd be glad
to give her to you, but she's right.

357
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,351
I'm gonna need some verification.

358
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,756
Oh, listen... I know what you mean.
I understand. Now...

359
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,633
I don't like to talk about this in public,
and I've never told anybody...

360
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,959
She does have a small
strawberry-like birthmark, uh...

361
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,355
It's kinda high up on her... left cheek

362
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,233
and it's unique.

363
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,110
Come to Daddy!

364
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,708
Mister!
What was I doing out in the ocean?

365
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,836
Um... That's something you like to do.
You know, divin' for oysters at night.

366
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,236
Sometimes you get pretty far
from the shore and that undertow...

367
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,478
Oysters? In a cold ocean at night?
That doesn't sound like me.

368
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,756
I just... ate a bug!

369
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,958
Keep your mouth closed!
A lot of things flying around out here.

370
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,828
Welcome home, baby!

371
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,516
I feel faint.

372
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,629
Come on, Buster! Come on, Jackson!

373
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,874
No. This is wrong.

374
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,958
Come along, now.
We've only been here a couple of weeks.

375
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,108
A lot of stuff's in boxes from the move,
so I hardly recognise the place myself.

376
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,198
We moved here... deliberately?

377
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,916
Our last place was a real dump.

378
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,715
Come on.

379
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,990
Our new palace!

380
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,708
Well!

381
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,674
Let me, uh... Let me show you around.
Maybe something'll come back to you.

382
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,636
- Did I just go downhill?
- Look at that. It's comin' back already.

383
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,354
Everything slants down here
toward the bedroom.

384
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,029
Dining room and toilet... Only one.

385
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,874
And here we are at the old,
uh... magic room.

386
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,876
Put a lot of miles on that mattress, huh?

387
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,228
Later.

388
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,557
All right! Here's where we have
breakfast every morning.

389
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,557
Let's go up...

390
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,557
Oh-ho! Here they come!

391
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,795
- Charlie tried to kill my turtle!
- He didn't. It slipped out of his hands!

392
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,275
- He did!
- Hey, hey, guys! Whoa!

393
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,789
Whoa! Hey, look who's home!

394
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,595
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

395
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,792
Gee, Mom! We really missed you.

396
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,832
We're so glad you're back.

397
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,559
They're... They're not mine.

398
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,990
Oh, honey!
I was sure you'd remember them!

399
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,354
Well, I think I'd remember if I had three...

400
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,835
<i>Four,</i> honey! Don't forget little Joe.

401
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,795
Well, that's about it except for...

402
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,038
Hey, she's been in there an hour.
What did you guys get her?

403
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,116
- Dresses.
- The right sizes?

404
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,754
You didn't tell us.
You just said get some dresses.

405
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,155
OK, on the couch.
Come on, guys, don't blow it.

406
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,872
Hey, a dirty magazine!

407
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,556
Baby doll!

408
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,269
This garment cannot possibly
be a part of my wardrobe.

409
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,437
Let's forget for a moment that it's a rag,

410
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,915
but it happens to be 12 sizes too large.

411
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,510
- It's... It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

412
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,191
Well, come on, honey. You gotta
admit, you've lost a lot of weight.

413
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,515
Huh? You used to be like a balloon!

414
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,276
- Was I also shorter?
- Yes!

415
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,991
Yes, you had a bad back. You walked
kinda hunched over, you know?

416
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,036
I was short <i>and</i> fat?

417
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,794
Look, I'm sure you've got
a million questions.

418
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,708
You've been through hell. So, let's
just take this thing one step at a time.

419
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,637
First, let's meet the boys.

420
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,958
In the middle we've got the twins - Greg
and Charlie. He likes to invent things.

421
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,231
- Twins?
- Yeah. Obviously, they're not identical.

422
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,557
- Or I'd look like a shithead!
- Who asked you, butthole?!

423
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,919
They came out fighting
and they're still at it!

424
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,439
Guys, guys!

425
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,473
Charlie and I get along very well, Mom.
My twin brother and I are best friends.

426
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,238
He's the actor in the family.

427
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,796
Then we got the big guy!
11 pounds 5 ounces.

428
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,718
Come on, honey, give it a try.
What's his name?

429
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,873
Roy?

430
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,277
No. Travis. Sweet Trav?

431
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,436
- Now, those are tits!
- My turn!

432
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,551
Hey, what are you...?

433
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,352
I was hopin' you'd recall this guy.
He's your newest, honey.

434
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,835
Hi, Mom! My name's Joe.

435
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,756
- A falsetto child?
- Ah, he thinks he's Pee Wee Herman.

436
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,030
I love Pee Wee Herman. Ha ha!

437
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,355
- Give your ma a kiss.
- No! No! No!

438
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,196
Do they have a problem
with their glands?

439
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,915
Hey, hey, guys, easy! Come on!

440
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,190
It's not us, Dad, it's Roy!

441
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,029
Ah, they're great boys, aren't they?

442
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,957
There's so many of them.

443
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,117
You've always had
your heart set on six, so...

444
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,196
we'll just keep on tryin'.

445
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,995
Dad! They're making me drink blood!

446
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,518
- Come back here!
- No, no, no!

447
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,356
They don't look anything like me!

448
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,359
They do take after your mother. Let's
hope they don't grow up to be lushes, too.

449
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,116
- My mother's a lush?
- Was, honey.

450
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,629
- Cirrhosis.
- She's...?

451
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,958
- What about my father?
- Oh, he's alive and well.

452
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,868
- And due for parole in, what, two years?
- Oh, God! I don't wanna hear any more!

453
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,275
- Look...
- I just wanna remember for myself.

454
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,109
The doctor says the best thing for you
is to get back to your normal routine.

455
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,119
You gotta get your memory back that
way. You gotta do what you normally do.

456
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,469
What is it I normally do?

457
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,119
I prepared and handled raw food?

458
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,198
I hunt it. You cook it.

459
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,959
- You shot a chicken?
- Come on, honey!

460
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,116
Save the jokes! We're starvin' here.

461
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,593
Yeah!

462
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,915
It's strange, but... ooh!

463
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,594
I feel as if I've never done this
before in my life.

464
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,633
Dad, are you and Uncle Billy really
gonna open a miniature golf course?

465
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,194
Nah. We'll just build it
when someone pays for it.

466
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,676
- What's miniature golf?
- For midget brains, like you.

467
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,756
- I was only asking.
- You shut up!

468
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,794
You're gonna make that turtle sick again.

469
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,110
You gotta breathe on it.

470
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,036
Look at me, Dad!

471
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,355
Nothing's happening.

472
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,033
Well, pumpkin, you gotta light the burner.

473
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,035
30 seconds.

474
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,436
29... 28... 27...

475
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,396
Fire, fire!

476
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,192
Hey, come here. Sit down.

477
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,834
- Let me see your hand.
- I smell hair!

478
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,554
I'll get the burn ointment.
You'll be all right.

479
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,636
Ouch!

480
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,310
OK, let's see, we...

481
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,556
Way to hustle, guys!

482
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,636
You all right?

483
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,356
Well, now we know they work.

484
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,870
- Pretty good eats!
- Should mashed potatoes be crunchy?

485
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,239
Where are you going?

486
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,917
Out! I go out every night after dinner.

487
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,350
Meet the boys at the bowling alley
for a couple of beers.

488
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,314
- Don't leave me alone with them!
- Come on, honey. That's not fair.

489
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,512
You know we live like this.
Never bothered you before.

490
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,518
It's just the way it is.
You'd better get used to it.

491
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,590
When are you coming home?

492
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,675
When I feel like it.
It just depends on how drunk I get.

493
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,991
How's it goin' with your debutante?

494
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,271
She's one lousy cook!
But as long as I don't have to do it.

495
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,632
- How long are you gonna keep her?
- Let's see. 25 bucks a day, huh?

496
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,268
Figure little wifey-poo can work off what
she owes me in... a little over a month.

497
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,278
- Your first night with her, huh?
- Mm-hm.

498
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,674
Uh-huh! Come on, huh!

499
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,552
I'm not gonna tell you
she doesn't have a great body.

500
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,592
And a pretty decent face...
Ah, she's too rich for my blood!

501
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,349
Chocolate cake's a bit rich too,
but I'd like to eat one once in a while.

502
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,278
Not my style.
Course, eating a whole cake isn't, either.

503
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,630
But I'm gonna have some fun
with her tonight!

504
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,115
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you drinkin'?

505
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,310
Some rotgut. Cheapest stuff they got.

506
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,192
Perfect.

507
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,635
Wait!

508
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,991
You jumped my bones
the first night we met!

509
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,477
- We did it on the first date?
- Well, I couldn't call it a date, really.

510
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,797
We just did it right there
in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven.

511
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,237
- I'm a slut.
- Huh?

512
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,713
Nothing.

513
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,316
- Ooh!
- Oh!

514
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,877
Hey, I'm a little drunk tonight,
baby, so, you know,

515
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
it might take me a while to get there.

516
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,797
Oh! What? No boom-boom?

517
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,309
Well, hey, I understand.

518
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,558
You probably just wanna go right
to sleep and skip the fun stuff, huh?

519
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,193
- Yes.
- OK.

520
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,595
Thank you. No boom-boom.

521
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,031
- Baby.
- Hm?

522
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,038
- The couch.
- What?

523
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,278
You see, honey, you've got a bad back
because the bed's too soft for you.

524
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,472
That's why you always sleep
on the living-room couch.

525
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,468
I'm a short... fat... slut.

526
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,235
Get off of my body!

527
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,318
Rover!

528
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,077
- Up, up, up, up, up! Come on!
- Help! Help!

529
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,432
Time to get up. Gotta fix the kids' lunches
or they'll miss the bus for school.

530
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,199
I don't care if they don't go to school.

531
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,676
OK. They'll just be with you all day.

532
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,993
Bye, Mom!

533
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,590
Whoa, whoa, the bus is here!
7.15, let's go!

534
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,392
Hurry up, Mom!

535
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,791
Roy. Roy!

536
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,798
My name is Travis.

537
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,197
Travis.

538
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,911
Travisss!

539
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,068
Come on, Joey.

540
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,633
Stop honking!

541
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,957
Twin! Oh, twin!

542
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,674
She means you.
Have a good day at school, honey.

543
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,559
You ready? You ready?
Come on, come on!

544
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,875
Bye, Mom. You're doin' a great job.

545
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,355
I'm off to work.

546
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,313
Somebody's gotta keep this family
in the lap of luxury.

547
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,278
I figured you'd forget,
so I made it for you myself.

548
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,233
- What?
- Your list of daily chores.

549
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,316
See ya tonight.

550
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,149
- Dean?
- D Zippety doo dah!

551
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,599
D Zippety yay!

552
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,598
D My oh my, I got a wonderful slave

553
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,676
And you are a genius!

554
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,155
You're living in a nightmare
that starts at the crack of dawn.

555
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,590
Down! Down!

556
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,470
D <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

557
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,349
d <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

558
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,756
d <i>Jim Dandy to the rescue</i>

559
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,674
d <i>Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!</i>

560
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,037
D <i>Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!</i>

561
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,154
Dinner! Dinner!

562
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,791
She needs food.

563
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,876
This is fun.

564
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,869
Hey, guys.

565
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,752
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothing. We're OK. We're fine.

566
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,713
- How about you?
- Oh, no. What's wrong with her?

567
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,395
She's been like that for an hour now.

568
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,556
- She's getting better, though.
- Better?

569
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,636
Yeah, she's not going "Ba-ba-ba..."

570
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,832
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

571
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,520
- Why did she do that?
- She destroyed the scarecrow.

572
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,392
She ripped the sucker's head off!

573
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,197
I like when she goes
"Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba."

574
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,958
Hey! Baby doll!

575
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,675
What's for dinner?

576
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,918
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu ba-ba-ha-ha...

577
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,918
OK! I'll take it from here.
Go on, get upstairs!

578
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,437
- Will you trade her in for a new one?
- Nah, she'll be all right.

579
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,916
Come on, guys! Move it!

580
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,916
Feel better?

581
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,989
I don't belong here. I feel it.
Don't you think I feel it?

582
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,394
I can't do any of these vile things
and I wouldn't want to!

583
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,116
My life is like death!

584
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,199
My children are the spawn of hell
and you're the devil.

585
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,276
Oh, God...

586
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,473
Baby, we <i>like</i> you.

587
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,954
She's OK. She's doin' the dishes.

588
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,197
- No more "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba".
- Good. All right.

589
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,435
- Dad?
- Yeah?

590
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,109
- Will she figure out we're tricking her?
- Not if we don't blow it.

591
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,438
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for memorabilia.

592
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,156
Memora-what?

593
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,916
Scrapbooks. Photographs.

594
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,116
Something that will spark
some wisp of a memory.

595
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,595
Do we or do we not possess these things?

596
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,598
Uh, well...

597
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,871
Do you mean to tell me
there is no photographic evidence

598
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,675
of our life together...
anywhere in existence?

599
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,031
Well, I don't know
where they'd be because, uh...

600
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,720
you know,
we lost a lot of stuff in the move.

601
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,434
And it's possible that, uh...

602
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,835
we lost...

603
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,876
The closet

604
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,952
and you.

605
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,079
That's right. This is me...
and I'm standing in front of the closet.

606
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,951
Something's familiar.

607
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,628
You got it. We used to do it in the closet.

608
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,591
Oh, stop with the sex stories!

609
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,075
You're grumpy
because you've been busy.

610
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,556
I want you to stop everything,
go on in here, take a bath...

611
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,240
Hey, guys!
Get the turtle out of the bathtub!

612
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,238
I'll look for the pictures
first thing in the morning, OK?

613
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,316
All right. Good night, honey.

614
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,514
- Somebody better be dead!
- Billy!

615
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,517
Billy, I want you to do me a favour.

616
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,676
- Who you talkin' to?
- Nobody.

617
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,074
- Who's that?
- No one.

618
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,599
Hey, is that Dean?

619
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,314
- Hi, Dean. Come on in.
- Go back to bed, Gertie.

620
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,592
- If you treat me like that, I'm goin' home.
- Come on, Gertie, don't be like that!

621
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,792
Remember in high school you faked
our IDs? I need a fake bride.

622
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,469
- Come on, Dean. I'm busy!
- Not any more. She's goin' home.

623
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,111
OK, but if we get caught, it's your ass!

624
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,919
It's my wedding day.
Why do I look so annoyed?

625
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,315
Oh, yeah. Your dad showed up shit-faced.

626
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,591
He threw potato salad all over my mom.
We had to throw him out!

627
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,393
Why do I always have
this depressed look on my face?

628
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,195
You were grumpy a lot. You were losing
the weight, then you gained it back.

629
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,835
- Thin, fat, thin, fat.
- Was I <i>always</i> this miserable?

630
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,952
- Wasn't I ever happy?
- Well, sure, honey. Lots.

631
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,753
You were the happiest
little wife and mother around!

632
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,555
Look at this. Before you lost the weight.
Can you believe it?

633
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,359
All right. Now, that's it. Are you satisfied?

634
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,276
- Yes.
- Good.

635
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,353
I suppose I belong here in this... hovel.

636
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,836
Come on, Jackson!

637
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,676
Well, this is my life.

638
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,236
I didn't marry very well, did I?

639
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,276
D <i>Your body</i>

640
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,109
I love LA. I love all my starlets!

641
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,674
- What were your names again?
- Tofutti Klein.

642
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,677
Tofutti! I love it!

643
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,950
If that's my mother-in-law,
I'm not here.

644
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,275
You're Kim and Kimberly...

645
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,639
- The Stayton yacht.
- <i>Hello, Andrew. It's Mrs Mintz</i>.

646
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,671
I'm so virile, I'm so rich!

647
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,791
<i>I'd like to speak to my daughter</i>.

648
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,354
<i>They're not here, madam</i>.
<i>They've gone shopping</i>.

649
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,074
Uh, a little bit lower.

650
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,668
Yeah. Yeah, lower.

651
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,316
That's good. That's good.

652
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,759
- Were you really in the Coast Guard?
- Damn right.

653
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,871
Why does he keep staring at me?

654
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,752
- Is he?
- Yes! He was staring at me

655
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,996
with his mouth open all through dinner.

656
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,874
Well, honey,
Billy was your high-school boyfriend.

657
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,149
You don't get any of the old feelings back
when you look at him, do you?

658
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,757
I don't wanna do it!

659
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,634
You gotta do it
if you wanna be a gruesome ghoul!

660
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,433
It's part of the initiation! Think about it.

661
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,518
That's good. Thanks a lot. Ah, yeah.

662
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,191
Uh, sugarlips.
I think our guest needs another beer.

663
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,957
Uh, well, I really shouldn't,
but maybe, uh... just one more

664
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,713
six-pack!

665
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,117
- Attagirl!
- Thank you.

666
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,798
That's all the beer.

667
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,309
Whoa, buttercup!
Just about time for dessert!

668
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,908
- How about some brownies?
- I didn't make any.

669
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,838
- How about chocolate cream pie?
- I made that.

670
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,589
- Is this gonna work?
- My ideas always work. I'm gifted.

671
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,871
I loved it when you glued Joey
to the toilet seat.

672
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,795
I was thinking about it at work.
We need a theme for the golf course.

673
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,477
We can use a few contraptions
you can knock some golf balls through.

674
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,797
- What's the score? I had my eyes closed.
- 32-10.

675
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,229
- Who's winning?
- The guys with 32.

676
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,197
- Great!
- Who did this?!

677
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,352
Travis!

678
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,675
Hey, honey, what happened?

679
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,758
Oooh! <i>This</i> happened.

680
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,954
- You guys are beggin' for it!
- Stop blustering! You won't punish them!

681
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,594
Ease up there, love chop! Just ease up.

682
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,109
Ease up? Ease up?

683
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,077
Since I walked through that door,
I have cooked, cleaned,

684
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,997
scrubbed, chopped wood.

685
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,795
I've waited on you, your dogs,
your kids and your friends

686
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,117
in the hopes that I would
remember some shred of my life

687
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,516
and now it is entirely clear to me
why I've chosen to block it out!

688
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,393
- Now, none of this ever...
- Bothered me before.

689
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,112
Well, it bothers me now.

690
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,080
- All right, Joe!
- Is that so?

691
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,834
Hey, hey, Joe! Come on, guys!
No more jokes on Mom today, huh?

692
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,996
You really got her where you want her.

693
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,918
I got everything under control,
don't worry.

694
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,032
- This is flat. Give me another one, Billy.
- I only got six.

695
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,709
We're just gonna have to send out
the old ball and chain to buy some more.

696
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,637
Good stuff!

697
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,716
Your chocolate cream pie.

698
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,198
Thanks, honey.

699
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,233
I guess it's kinda tough to serve
with your hands stuck to plates.

700
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,512
Honey, we need forks!

701
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,836
- Sugarlips!
- Yeah?

702
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,672
Wait a minute!

703
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,716
Fire, fire, fire!

704
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,909
- Yeah!
- OK, guys, go get her!

705
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,996
Hey, thanks for a lovely dinner.

706
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,032
- She never did that before.
- She did it now!

707
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,913
- Look at this! I gotta go to work!
- Wait for me!

708
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,630
She went this way, guys!

709
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,115
Gruesome ghouls, attack!

710
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,834
- What should I do, Travis?
- Go home!

711
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,193
I got you!

712
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,918
- Tickle her!
- She's ticklish!

713
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,476
Ow, that hurts! Ow!

714
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,151
Leave me alone!

715
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,796
All right, time to get up.

716
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,713
Go to the bathroom
and do what you normally do.

717
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,673
- You gonna squirt us with a hose again?
- That's up to you.

718
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,759
- I gotta feed my turtle.
- The damn turtle stole my headband.

719
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,836
Joey, come on. Time to get up!

720
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,589
I don't want to! The teacher's a big fat tub!

721
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,276
Proffitt boys, come up here!

722
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,918
Miss Pitcannon tells me
you don't wanna take these tests.

723
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,429
I'm itchin' and I wanna go home!

724
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,553
You may go stand in the corner
until you can talk like a little boy!

725
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,399
All of you children
are new in this school.

726
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,956
These scores will determine
your placement in future classes.

727
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,868
- You must concentrate... Greg! Stop that!
- Make a face.

728
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,036
- I'm in real bad shape!
- Nonsense!

729
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,517
Now, if you concentrate, I'm sure
you can control those little bodies.

730
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,351
I see that, Amanda.

731
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,436
Joey, sit!

732
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,836
- Is anyone at your home?
- Yeah. Our mom is.

733
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,191
You have a mother now?
Your father remarried?

734
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,118
Um, yeah. We got a new mother now.

735
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,676
Well, good.
Then I'm calling <i>both</i> your parents!

736
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,430
Mrs Burbridge, I'm Annie Proffitt.
What happened?

737
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,872
Well, Mrs Proffitt, apparently
your children consider themselves

738
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,594
above taking
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests.

739
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,473
I'm sorry. What are
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests?

740
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,799
Placement tests. They are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential.

741
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,114
Sit still!

742
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,038
Your children are a discipline problem.

743
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,391
I know. I have had difficulties myself.

744
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,117
- What did you do now?
- Oh! They decided to play sick!

745
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,595
And not very convincingly.

746
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,350
Now, I believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance.

747
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,074
The children are slovenly, incorrigible

748
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,796
and being reared by a father who clearly
isn't concerned about their welfare,

749
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,753
but is himself just a large child!

750
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,555
- Excuse me, Mrs Burbridge.
- Oh, the test results. Thank you.

751
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,355
I'll look these over as soon as
I'm finished with this... <i>woman</i>.

752
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,391
Oh, my God.

753
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,473
I'll see you later in the cafeteria.

754
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,631
Mrs Burbridge,
would you come over here for a moment?

755
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,078
Has it escaped your attention that these
children have head-to-toe poison oak?

756
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,555
Well, no... Yes, but...

757
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,275
But what? My children are
in need of medical assistance!

758
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,279
And you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests?

759
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,757
Tests which label children's potential -
a thing which <i>cannot</i> be measured!

760
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,678
Least of all by anal-compulsive Huns!

761
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,312
And my husband may be a large child,
but that's none of your business.

762
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,908
And my children may be rotten,
but they're mine!

763
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,508
And I think that they're bright
and sensitive.

764
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,712
So I have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence!

765
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,798
I do, however,
have serious doubts about yours!

766
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,951
Kids, get in the car. Let's go.

767
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,275
Move!

768
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,799
- She told her off.
- Dad never did that.

769
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,072
Discipline problem?

770
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,479
My regards to
Schwartzman and Heinliken.

771
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,268
I can't stop itching!

772
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,359
Well, what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak?

773
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,952
What I want you to do, what the doctor
said, is put it right on the red parts.

774
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,149
OK?

775
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,750
Soon we're going to clean up
this room because it's a disgrace.

776
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,395
- We like it like a disgrace.
- Dad lets us do whatever we want!

777
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,875
Yeah, well, it's trickling
down the stairway.

778
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,959
Joey, don't. Don't get that near your eyes.
Look, I want you to read this.

779
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,311
See what it says?
"Don't get near your eyes." Read on.

780
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,795
- What's this all about?
- He's embarrassed cos he can't read.

781
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,151
- Well, he's a small child.
- He can't read for a small child either.

782
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,078
The teacher makes fun of him!

783
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,190
OK, we'll talk about this later.
Go to sleep.

784
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,391
- Dean!
- Where is that?

785
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,919
- Dean!
- Yeah!

786
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,951
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

787
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,753
Out. If I could ever find my...

788
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,231
Oh, wait. Wait!

789
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,316
Not tonight! We have to talk.

790
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,273
- When I get home. I'm in a hurry.
- Now!

791
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,917
You know, I let the water routine slide by
the other day, but let's not push it, OK?

792
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,237
I got a little carried away with the hose,
but this is important.

793
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,794
OK, fine. What's on your mind, sugarlips?

794
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,151
Stop calling me sugarlips!
I have a name. Call me Annie.

795
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,477
Get to the point, <i>Annie</i>. I'm busy.
The guys are waitin' for me.

796
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,752
You can't run out every time things get
complicated here. The kids are sick!

797
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,440
They got calamine lotion.
What do you want me to do?

798
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,315
- Take on some grown-up responsibility!
- I earn the money. That's a responsibility.

799
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,913
Are you aware that Joey can't read?
That Travis only reads smut magazines?

800
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,352
- I can't get him out of the bathroom.
- He's 13! I'll build you another bathroom!

801
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,313
They don't need that!
They need guidance from you!

802
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,389
Oh-oh-oh! Now, don't you worry
about me and my boys, OK? We're pals.

803
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,910
They have enough pals.
They need a father.

804
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,749
Hey, hey, hey, look. I decided
a long time before you... you and me...

805
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,156
<i>We</i> decided a long time ago,
before we started this family,

806
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,556
we'd raise these kids naturally,
not force bullshit rules...

807
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,240
I'm not talking about discipline.
I'm talking...

808
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,036
Stuff you shouldn't be talking about!
It's none of your business, anyway.

809
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,994
- My children are none of my business?
- Look... I have... Now I'm late!

810
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,076
Thanks a lot(!) Appreciate it.

811
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,714
Say, Annie. Are you asleep?

812
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,149
No. Go away.

813
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,998
Uh... listen. I'm...

814
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,320
I'm sorry I came down on you
so hard before.

815
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,636
It's OK.

816
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,231
Just so you won't think I don't appreciate
all the work you're doin' in the house

817
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,318
and how you handle the kids
and all that, uh...

818
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,676
You know, I think you're doin' great.

819
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,399
I mean, what you said about me
and the boys tonight, uh...

820
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,236
I guess you probably...

821
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,192
You know, maybe you got a small point
there, and I just... I can't...

822
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,395
I can't talk to you
while you're turned away.

823
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,318
- Will you just please get your head out?
- No.

824
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,396
- No!
- Why?

825
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,556
Because I'm so ugly.

826
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,789
I got poison oak, too!

827
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,552
Come on, now.
Nobody cares what you look like.

828
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,798
I mean, we do like the way you look.
Normally you look real pretty.

829
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,514
You just don't now.

830
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,156
All right, forget it.

831
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,037
I don't even have a wedding ring!

832
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,915
- What?
- I lost my wedding ring in the sea.

833
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,993
OK, come on. Come on.

834
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,714
Let's go.

835
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,549
Oh, no.
I'm not going back in the water barrel!

836
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,757
I'm puttin' you in the bedroom.
I'll take the couch.

837
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,874
Oh, hey, listen.
I've had poison oak a million times.

838
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,116
Come on, guys. Up! Up!

839
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,639
Yeah. You know,
I once got poison oak on my bu... back.

840
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,759
And, uh...

841
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,714
Well, don't you worry.
It'll be gone in no time. Lift your head.

842
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,673
- That's it. Is that better?
- Yeah.

843
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,756
- All right?
- Yes.

844
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,714
Tell me something about my life,
about my past. Please.

845
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,636
Something not horrible.

846
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,676
Uh, OK.

847
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,312
Yeah. Well, there was that time, uh...

848
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,953
...when you were, uh...

849
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,230
You were working at...

850
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,828
yeah, Burger Boy over in Lewisville.

851
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,069
And, uh, this kid started
choking on a French fry.

852
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,556
Everybody there panicked,
including me, except for you.

853
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,118
You ran over to him and you gave him
that Heimlich manoeuvre, where you...

854
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,394
And poof! The kid puked up the fry

855
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,239
and they named you
Burger Boy employee of the month.

856
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,478
It was great. They put your picture
above the cash register and...

857
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,239
I was really proud of you. I mean it.

858
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,079
You can be quite charming
when you wanna be.

859
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,918
Ah. You just caught me on a bad day.

860
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,996
Good night... Annie.

861
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,476
Good night.

862
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,391
- Heads up!
- After I finished with the Coast Guard,

863
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,233
I looked up Dean.
We used to play football together.

864
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,909
Used to call him Mean Dean Proffitt.
Used to call me Bad Billy Pratt.

865
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,395
- Out!
- Now, Billy, when did we date?

866
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,036
Let's eat!

867
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,753
- It might be...
- Are we talking about the golf course?

868
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,633
Yeah. The guys with suits
come down in less than a week.

869
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,478
What do you think about this, huh?

870
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,751
Sink 'Em and Drink 'Em.
18 holes based on famous breweries.

871
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,474
I think what I thought yesterday.
It's a lousy idea.

872
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,114
I thought you'd change your mind
now you're sober.

873
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,198
What about other places? Foreign places.

874
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,276
What do you mean?
Like France or Africa?

875
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,709
<i>Mais oui!</i>
<i>La Tour Eiffel, comme c'est jolie!</i>

876
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,354
I speak French!

877
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,390
It just came out.

878
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,636
Do I know what I said?

879
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,478
Yes, I do.

880
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,636
I must have learned that in Paris.

881
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,636
When was I in Paris?

882
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,471
In the Navy.

883
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,558
- Navy.
- Well, it's a stupid idea in any language.

884
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,240
Besides, we're building
these things in America.

885
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,711
Wait a minute. This isn't a bad idea.

886
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,274
I could invent some wild things here.
Go on.

887
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,915
Well, like, uh... the Taj Mahal,
Seven Wonders of the World.

888
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,158
- Bring them to the people of Elk Cove!
- Well, I gotta bring it in for a price.

889
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,953
I can bring it in,
but can you draw me some pictures

890
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,594
so I can see what you mean? Annie?

891
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,350
- What's this?
- Travis found a girlfriend.

892
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,392
Hey, Trav! Don't knock her up!

893
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,989
- Very funny! Watch your...
- Oh, Mom!

894
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,236
Yeah, "Oh, Mom!" Watch your language!

895
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,590
Come on! What are you talkin' about?

896
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,678
- Pick a wonder.
- Stevie Wonder.

897
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,638
- Give me a wonder. One wonder.
- There's Mount Rushmore.

898
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,716
- The Parthenon.
- Parthenon, right.

899
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,913
- St Basil's, the Russian cathedral.
- Grand Canyon. Everybody'll love that!

900
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,315
- Egyptian pyramids.
- The Eiffel Tower.

901
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,309
It's expensive. I gotta build...
If it rains... Hey, fibreglass! Perfect!

902
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,830
Let's clean up for an early dinner.
I've got a lot of drawing to do.

903
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,916
Isn't Dad gonna eat with us tonight?

904
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,235
No! He had to go out.

905
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,629
- He had to go bowling this time.
- Really?

906
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,593
It's pretty hard to go bowling
without a bowling ball.

907
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,957
D I know I done you wrong

908
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,992
d Do you remember
that rainy evening I put you out

909
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,553
d With nothin' but a fine-toothed comb

910
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,750
What would you want
with old sweet-mouth?

911
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,269
D Ain't that a shame, I know I'm to blame

912
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,756
d Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home?

913
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,555
<i>Scott Murphy,</i>
<i>bring your invoice up to the front</i>.

914
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,070
This ain't your average
pile of fertiliser here.

915
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,637
Uh-uh. No, siree.
This here's a special blend.

916
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,550
Fish heads, shrimp skins,
crab claws, earthworm droppings...

917
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,875
I don't wanna know that much about it.

918
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,958
- Here you go.
- After this, you get to shovel fish guts!

919
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,469
If you're lucky,
we'll let you clean the truck!

920
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,112
- Whoops! I forgot to give you this.
- What have I got to put on airs for?

921
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,196
Oh, stop fussing. You look great.

922
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,313
Well, they put their pants on
just like me - one leg at a time.

923
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,476
Now, don't be nervous, OK?

924
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,431
If you don't get it, so what?

925
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,757
We've been through
rougher times than these before.

926
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,836
I think.

927
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,948
Gentlemen, this is Dean Proffitt,
inventor and master craftsman.

928
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,830
What we're here for this evening is this.

929
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,669
It's the Wonders of the World
miniature golf course.

930
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,509
If you look at these pictures,
you can begin to sort of feel...

931
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,474
What we're trying to do is bring some
of this outer world here into Elk Cove.

932
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,637
The Leaning Tower of Pizza
doubles as a pizza stand.

933
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,309
That sort of gives us an idea
of where we might go in the future.

934
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,194
Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Here, let me get that.

935
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,436
Waitress! Get over here, will you?

936
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,109
Have you ever been nervous in your life?

937
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,229
Go ahead, ask me.
Ask me if we got the money.

938
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,918
Did you get the money?

939
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,315
- We got the money!
- Oooh, great!

940
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,829
- That's so great!
- Can you believe it?!

941
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,074
Step up! She rolls up here... and down.

942
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,719
It's got three choices. This time,
it's going through the oil funnel,

943
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,799
past the plastic fan,
into the kids' sand shovel and flour sifter.

944
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,311
Now, turn around quick. Here it comes.
It should be out about now.

945
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,431
- OK, now show me your invention.
- You're gonna hate it.

946
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,391
I'm not gonna hate it. I love 'em.

947
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,033
That's nice.

948
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,718
I gotta tell her, Billy.
I gotta tell Annie the truth.

949
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,798
In the beginning, it was OK
because it was part of a gag.

950
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,151
Now it's more like lies. I...
I know what you're thinkin'.

951
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,750
- Hey, I'm not thinkin' anything.
- Yeah, you are and I'm gonna tell her.

952
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,836
I know it's time to tell her!

953
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,715
Ooh, Dr Death looks mad.

954
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,355
- Joker's saying "No".
- I know. What does he say up here?

955
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,719
"I will re... re... re..."

956
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:45,516
- Reduce.
- "Reduce your puny planet to rub..."

957
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,316
- Ru... ru...
- Rubble.

958
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,034
Good! That's very good, sweetie.

959
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,435
Are you gonna leave?

960
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,117
No. I'm your mommy.

961
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,232
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Sometimes moms leave.

962
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,196
Well, I guess maybe they do.
But I'm not gonna go anywhere.

963
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,276
Good.

964
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,075
Oooh, what is this?
Is this a present for me?

965
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,749
- Yes. I made it from macaroni.
- I love it.

966
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,310
I'll always wear it.

967
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,751
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi! How's it goin', guys?

968
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,189
I got the part of Tiny Tim
in the school play.

969
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,629
- I got an A in English.
- I'm flunkin' math.

970
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,398
Well, I guess we better
work on it later on, huh?

971
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,432
You're just in time.
Dr Death is on the rampage.

972
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,871
Annie, I need to talk to you.

973
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,956
Alone, guys.

974
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,399
- Is something wrong?
- Uh, well...

975
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,988
No. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

976
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,669
No, I just... I need to tell you somethin'.
Here, sit down.

977
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,196
What is it?

978
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,596
Annie, I've done...
I've done something that, um...

979
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,234
I'm ashamed of. And I just...

980
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,272
- I already know.
- You do?

981
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,957
- What... What do you know?
- You work nights at the fertiliser plant.

982
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,509
You don't have to be ashamed
because you shovel fish guts.

983
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,080
I'm proud of you no matter what you do.

984
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,079
- Is that it?
- Uh, well, that's one of the things, but I...

985
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,431
No. Not really.

986
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,036
What is it?

987
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,510
Annie...

988
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,756
I...

989
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,318
I... God, I forgot your birthday.

990
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,838
- It's my birthday?
- Come on! Get dressed!

991
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,110
D Jim Dandy to the rescue

992
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,990

997

998

1002
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,512
- What?
- Are we going home?

1003
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,598
- Oh, no. I just... Aren't you hot?
- Yeah. Let's go outside.

1004
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,837
- Come on!
- Hey, let's not forget this. It's $7 a pop.

1005
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,635
Don't worry about what it costs.
It's your birthday! I got it covered.

1006
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,600
Just one last toast to your birthday.

1007
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,590
Oh! Whoops, I lost my bottom.

1008
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,233
Wait a minute.

1009
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,637
There! They always do that. Now, this is...

1010
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,830
- Happy birthday, Annie.
- Thanks, Dean.

1011
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,909
- I've never tasted anything quite like this.
- It's good stuff.

1012
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,909
Boy, it sure is pretty, isn't it?

1013
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,550
Why do they honk three times?

1014
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,636
To signal they're comin' home.

1015
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,709
Yeah, it's a legend... of Arturo,
who was a Portuguese fisherman.

1016
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,389
He met this beautiful girl
his first night in town - Catarina.

1017
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,239
And, um, eventually they fell in love.

1018
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,194
But the problem was that Catarina's
father was the territorial governor.

1019
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,471
He didn't want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman.

1020
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,433
So he told Arturo
that he'd have to ship off,

1021
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,030
which he did, but he told Catarina
he'd be back for her

1022
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,914
and when he came back,
he'd signal with three long blasts

1023
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,318
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat, and they'd be on their way.

1024
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,237
Oh, I love this story.

1025
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,158
So, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1026
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,510
But when she was swimmin' out
to the boat,

1027
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,155
the fog got so thick that, uh,
she couldn't find the boat.

1028
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,549
Arturo panicked
and he called out "Catarina! Catarina!"

1029
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,557
Catarina yelled back "Arturo!"

1030
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,753
With that, he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters, and they...

1031
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,155
- Kissed.
- No, they drowned.

1032
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,669
They never found each other
and they drowned.

1033
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,395
- Oh, that's a terrible story!
- Yeah, but the legend is

1034
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,479
they reunited at the bottom of the sea,
right over there,

1035
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,878
and every time you see
the spray goin' up, it's them.

1036
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,151
- Making love?
- Yeah.

1037
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,236
For ever and ever.

1038
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,952
D For I can't help

1039
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,714
d Falling in love...

1040
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,796
Dean?

1041
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,116
What, Annie?

1042
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,636
How old am I?

1043
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,756
29.

1044
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,596
- Dean.
- Yeah?

1045
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,476
Was it always like this?

1046
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,920
Every time with you is like the first time.

1047
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,038
Oh, come on, guys!

1048
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,310
Hey, let us sleep for a while!

1049
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,396
Right, that's it! I'm gonna spank 'em.

1050
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,229
- No! Dean, please don't.
- Every one of them's gonna get it!

1051
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,353
Surprise!

1052
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,675
- A washing machine!
- Do you like it?

1053
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,630
Honey, it's so expensive.

1054
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,716
No shit!

1055
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,672
Thank you.

1056
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,951
She might have no tits
but she has a nice ass.

1057
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,192
Grant?

1058
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,072
Edith. Hello.

1059
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,988
This is ludicrous, Grant.
I have called every week for two months.

1060
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,031
<i>I've looked forward to each call</i>.

1061
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,197
Do you have the gall to tell me
that I've missed her again?

1062
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,834
- She's sleeping.
- <i>I don't believe you</i>.

1063
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,235
<i>Grant, if you do not produce Joanna</i>

1064
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,388
in one week, I am going to hire a mass
of mercenaries to hunt you down

1065
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,229
and chop off the protruding parts
of your body. Is that clear?

1066
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,397
I'll find her. I mean, you'll have
your daughter soon. Bye!

1067
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,556
Andrew. Point the boat back to Elk Snout.

1068
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,078
You and Mommy are going
to take a little trip, aren't we?

1069
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,475
We's gonna go bye-bye, yes!

1070
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,150
- Sit there and don't get dirty!
- I hate this.

1071
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,033
It's not so bad to get dressed up
every once in a while.

1072
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,310
It's like the goddamn Brady Bunch!

1073
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,478
- Dad's here!
- Mom, Dad's home!

1074
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,556
Hey, guys!

1075
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,718
I gotta go put on a suit.
Gertie's picking me up.

1076
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,274
How can you go hunting
on such an important day?

1077
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,359
- Easy. Pheasant don't play miniature golf.
- Hunting calms Billy down, honey.

1078
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,792
- The ceremonies start in an hour.
- Billy, hang this guy out.

1079
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,036
Sweetie, I'll be ready... in a second.

1080
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,391
I lent the station wagon to Gertie
so we have to take the truck.

1081
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,272
God! What a mess.

1082
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,556
Feathers!

1083
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,835
"JS".

1084
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,790
Honey, would you hand me a towel there?

1085
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,717
Thanks.

1086
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,717
What... What is this?

1087
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,195
No, that's my question.
They were in the truck.

1088
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,474
These are... I dunno what these are.
I... Who...

1089
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,319
Here. I, uh, we gotta get going.
We're gonna be late.

1090
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,510
Thanks for putting my clothes on the bed.

1091
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,870
- Oh, stop it!
- This is nothing!

1092
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,992
Nothing?
I gave you the best years of my life.

1093
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,031
I've raised your children.

1094
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,516
I bore your fruit four times
and you tell me this is nothing?

1095
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,949
You're making a big deal
out of a little thing.

1096
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,878
It's the number one cause
of divorce in this country.

1097
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,912
Where's my jacket? What divorce?
What are you saying...

1098
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,316
- I'm saying what I'm saying.
- You're saying what you're saying!

1099
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,398
- What, you wanna divorce?
- Well, uh... yeah, maybe I do!

1100
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,830
- Well, you can't have one.
- Oh, really. I can have a divorce.

1101
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,589
- Where did I put my damn boots?
- I can get a divorce if I want to.

1102
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,075
I don't need your permission.

1103
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,956
Do you love her?

1104
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,830
Do you?

1105
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,796
Tell me.

1106
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,718
Honestly? Yes and no.

1107
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,239
- More yes than no?
- This is unbelievable! How did you...?!

1108
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,477
I'm glad this happened.

1109
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,390
I've been tryin' to figure out a way to tell
you this for ever. Come here. Sit down.

1110
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,476
I wanna tell you something.

1111
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,276
JS is you. These are yours and we're not
married. There. God, I finally said it!

1112
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,356
What's her name? Jacqueline? Josie?

1113
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,994
Honey, I'm not your husband
and you're not my wife.

1114
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,157
Is she from that fertiliser plant?
Does she hand out shovels?

1115
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,238
These aren't your kids!
You didn't bear anything!

1116
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,318
- Don't change the subject! Who is she?!
- Forget it! Come here!

1117
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,554
- Guys, we gotta talk and this is serious.
- Mom, we're still all clean!

1118
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,639
I just told her about her not being your
mother and I want you to tell her, too.

1119
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,629
- Go ahead, tell her.
- Dad, tell her what?

1120
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,638
- Tell her she's not your mother.
- But she is our mother!

1121
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,038
No. Don't tell her what I told you
to tell her. Just tell her the truth now, OK?

1122
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,072
- Tell her about the day she came home!
- She went for a swim.

1123
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,794
We were really worried.
I was up all night pacing.

1124
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,311
- You'd never seen her before!
- Don't speak to my children that way!

1125
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,596
- What do you think you're doing?
- We won't let you ruin <i>everything</i>.

1126
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,154
- We're keepin' her.
- She doesn't belong to you!

1127
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,840
She didn't belong to you,
but that didn't stop you!

1128
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,315
- I had my reasons!
- So do we.

1129
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,316
- We like her, Dad!
- You like her, do you?

1130
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,432
So much you'd rather live with her
than your own father?!

1131
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,789
- Found 'em in the glove compartment?
- Yeah. Tell me every sordid detail.

1132
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,354
Who is JS and what does she do to Dean?

1133
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,313
- Annie...
- Tell me everything. Be honest with me.

1134
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,398
Annie, uh... That's my underwear.

1135
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,151
- What?
- I don't mean I wear it or anything.

1136
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,874
- It belongs to a girlfriend.
- What about Gertie?

1137
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,629
I strayed. See, I got lucky
with this phone-sex girl one night.

1138
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,320
I found one that accepted
personal cheques and...

1139
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:08,274
You see, I don't have a back seat
in my truck so I... I used yours.

1140
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,392
Dean doesn't want you to tell Gert,
so he's covering for me.

1141
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,717
- What are you talking about?
- I confessed. The jig is up.

1142
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,513
The jig <i>is</i> up!
I'm finally trying to tell her the truth.

1143
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:22,555
I just did. See, I didn't get the reputation
for being Bad Billy Pratt by accident.

1144
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,875
Annie, I'm sorry.

1145
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,956
I got horny.

1146
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,878
- Do you hate me?
- Oh, no, I don't hate you.

1147
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,308
- I'm glad you're bad, Billy Pratt.
- Biggest load of bullshit I've seen.

1148
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:39,116
Honey, honey. Phone-for-sex girls
don't come to your truck, honey. They...

1149
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,710
No, stop trying to cover for him, sweetie.
Let's just forget it.

1150
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,628
Pretty expensive panties.
You can have these back.

1151
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,149
That girl must have more than one phone.

1152
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,432
Pretty good, huh?

1153
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,791
You did this to protect your ass
because you faked my pictures?

1154
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,913
No, I did it to protect <i>your</i> ass, OK?
You belong with her.

1155
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,716
Oh, cute.

1156
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,718
Mom! Help, he has my hand.

1157
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,991
Why do you stick your hands
in people's mouths, anyway?

1158
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,156
Let's go. Let's go to another one.

1159
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,033
I have been calling all over Elk Cove.

1160
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:47,109
No, no. Don't worry. No, no.
I will try Portland for a limousine.

1161
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,233
I really don't have anything
to say except that, uh...

1162
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,911
there would be no Wonders of the World
miniature golf course if it wasn't for

1163
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,112
the imagination
and the creativity of one woman.

1164
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,071
That's my Annie.
Annie, you wanna come up here?

1165
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,397
I love you, Annie.
I want you to be with me always.

1166
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,319
Everybody, play ball!

1167
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,111
Let's go clean up.

1168
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,713
- Hey, Dad! Whose car is that?
- Maybe it's a rich relative.

1169
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,550
- Sure, it's Daddy Warbucks!
- Maybe we won the lottery.

1170
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,149
Hi, Grant!
I just have to put these in some water.

1171
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,354
Grant? Is that you?

1172
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,995
Yes.

1173
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,192
Yes, you're Grant Stayton III.

1174
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,236
I remember!

1175
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,796
I remember. I'm Joanna Stayton.

1176
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,309
Ooh! Dean, I'm cured.

1177
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,396
I can remember again.

1178
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,672
Oh, God!

1179
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,156
You can't imagine how terrible it is
not to know who you are.

1180
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,398
The doctor said that my mind would
come back suddenly and he was right.

1181
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,195
I saw you, I walked past you into the
house and poof! My memory came back.

1182
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,551
Ask me anything.
Ask me about my childhood in New York.

1183
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,875
Uh, about my mom. Her name is Edith.

1184
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,911
About my money. Money!

1185
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,476
I have money! I have lots of money!
I even have some in Switzerland!

1186
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,556
- Switzerland?
- See how I know me?

1187
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,148
Oh, God, this is
the happiest day of my life!

1188
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,714
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for bringing me here

1189
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,229
and making me a wife and a mother and...

1190
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,316
Why did you do that?

1191
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,235
Why...?

1192
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,316
I know why.

1193
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,759
You're that sweaty carpenter
who hates me.

1194
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,758
And these are your children,
and you made me

1195
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,036
believe that...

1196
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,716
Oh, God...

1197
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,476
You tricked me.

1198
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,956
You used me.

1199
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,996
Say something.

1200
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:49,396
- Annie, it just started out...
- My name is not Annie.

1201
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,636
And I don't belong with you.

1202
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,556
And I don't belong with them.

1203
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,000
I have to... get my things.

1204
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,869
Don't get any ideas. I brought Olaf.

1205
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,319
Olaf!

1206
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,037
I think we can take Olaf.

1207
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,352
I won't have...

1208
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,435
There's nothing inside that's mine.

1209
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,795
Joanna, for whatever it's worth,

1210
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,434
thank you.

1211
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,636
Come on, dear.

1212
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,315
We'll get you out of these clothes.

1213
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,830
- Mom, wait!
- Mom!

1214
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,633
- Mom!
- Mom, come back!

1215
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,753
- You said moms don't leave!
- Get!

1216
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,555
We should have told her, Dad.

1217
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,636
She just would have left sooner.

1218
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,036
Come on.

1219
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,076
Welcome back, Mrs Stayton.

1220
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,388
Dr Korman, will she ever again
be the debutante I raised?

1221
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,195
- Will she be one of us?
- Joanna wants to rediscover her old self.

1222
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,035
Her memory's almost
completely restored.

1223
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,594
She even recalled the session
where I wrote this.

1224
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,395
D I love you madly
though you treat me badly...

1225
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,795
Dr Korman! Please!

1226
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,708
We need analysis, not "Moon River"!
I want my wife back.

1227
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,230
Joanna knows who she is.
And she's trying to behave that way.

1228
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,395
Happy?

1229
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,636
Good evening, madam.

1230
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,673
- Ah, my darling Joanna.
- You look radiant, Jo-Jo.

1231
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,236
Oh, please don't call me that.
I feel like a Pomeranian.

1232
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,272
You liked being called Jo-Jo.
It was diddums you hated.

1233
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,996
Mother, why does Dr Korman have to be
here? I feel self-conscious enough as it is.

1234
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,829
Oh, sweetie. Just indulge Mommy, hm?

1235
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,838
Come along, now. Sit, sit, sit.

1236
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,916
Andrew, I'm sitting.

1237
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,112
Now, Mrs Mintz.

1238
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:33,231
Dr Korman knows you so well, dear,
and he only wants to help.

1239
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,352
- Champagne, madam.
- Ah, thank you, Andrew.

1240
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,953
- Andrew, I'd love a beer.
- A beer?

1241
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,396
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- Nothing is ever wrong.

1242
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,116
Actually, I really don't see the harm
in accommodating her wishes, Andrew.

1243
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,635
- Cigarette, darling?
- I don't smoke, Mother. Do I?

1244
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,955
Of course you smoke.
You've always smoked.

1245
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,514
- I smoke.
- Why don't we all smoke?

1246
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,796
Why do I have to smoke? I've never
smoked. I get sick when I smoke.

1247
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,514
Why does everyone try to make me
do what I don't want to do?

1248
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,996
Grant, we are not interested
in <i>your</i> therapy.

1249
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,671
I had my nervous breakdown and
I didn't have therapy. I never had therapy!

1250
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,228
- Mother, would you like some?
- I'd love some.

1251
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,636
Put that down! Good God, Joanna!
We have servants for that.

1252
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,671
Now, really, this is going too far.

1253
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,031
Joanna, what motivated you
to rise and go get the serving tray?

1254
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,239
Well, I thought you might be hungry.

1255
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,999
- That's excellent.
- What's excellent about it?

1256
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,556
- I was hungry.
- Your beer, madam.

1257
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,399
Who cares that you were hungry!
She became a waitress!

1258
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,875
- My daughter's a waitress?!
- Hold it.

1259
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,151
Mm!

1260
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,236
Good stuff.

1261
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,239
I'll stay an extra few days, yes.

1262
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,389
- They won't come in.
- Shit.

1263
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,750
Spaghettio Surprise.

1264
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,319
- What's goin' on?
- We're gettin' Mom back.

1265
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,637
- We miss her.
- Yeah, she cuts the crusts off the bread.

1266
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,070
She doesn't take any of my shit either.
I need discipline.

1267
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,679
We got $3.04.

1268
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,712
We're gonna rent a fishing boat
and get her back.

1269
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,230
No fishing boat's gonna catch a yacht,
especially at that price.

1270
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:52,592
- Maybe she'll decide to come back.
- Dumbo, she's on her way to New York!

1271
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,110
- This is a job for Dr Death.
- Yeah, Dr Death could do it!

1272
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,196
We gotta do somethin'. Right, Dad?

1273
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,958
Wrong!

1274
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,036
Now, she's gone, guys.

1275
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,752
She hates me!

1276
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:09,151
She's got her rich husband back...
and her rich life and that's the end of it.

1277
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,073
I love the sound of the ocean.

1278
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,833
Hallo-ooo!

1279
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,872
Tofutti.

1280
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,639
Ah, Tofutti, where are you
when I need you?

1281
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,470
Tofutti Klein-ein-ein-ein...

1282
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,556
All together. And!

1283
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,393
Lick, shake, lick.

1284
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,955
Drink!

1285
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,436
Suck!

1286
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,878
- You sucked first!
- No, I didn't! I did it right!

1287
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,075
- Danger watch! Gotta go! Let's go!
- Oh, yes.

1288
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,433
Croissants in the morning!

1289
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,870
- Dinner was wonderful.
- <i>Merci beaucoup. Bonne nuit</i>.

1290
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,594
You best not lose these again, madam.

1291
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,029
- Again?
- With my apologies, madam.

1292
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,948
"Andrew! I seem to have lost
my ruby earrings somewhere between...

1293
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,993
...<i>6</i>4th... and <i>6</i>8th Streets."

1294
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,838
"Find them!"

1295
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,396
I've behaved so badly. I don't know
how you put up with me for so long.

1296
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,829
You've done so many
wonderful things for me

1297
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,315
and I've never even once said thank you.

1298
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,716
I'm sorry.

1299
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,156
Apology accepted, ma'am.

1300
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,477
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think they're right?

1301
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,070
Oh, no, madam. Oh, no.

1302
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,709
Most of us... go through life
with blinders on, madam,

1303
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:04,477
knowing only that one little station
to which we were born.

1304
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,990
But you, madam, on the other hand,
have had the rare privilege

1305
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,317
of escaping your bonds for just a spell

1306
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,398
to see life from an entirely
new perspective.

1307
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:21,509
How you choose to use that information,
madam, is entirely up to you.

1308
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,155
- Captain Karl?
- Yes, ma'am.

1309
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,033
- We've never really had time to talk.
- No, we haven't.

1310
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,116
Well, there's no time now.

1311
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,269
- What are you doing?
- Turning the boat around.

1312
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,153
- Why?
- I'm going home.

1313
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,919
You're turning that wheel too fast.

1314
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:21,235
Captain Karl! Why is the land
on the wrong side of the yacht?

1315
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,990
Oh, she did?
Well, she's gone too far this time.

1316
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,315
She thinks she's dealing with an idiot!

1317
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,395
So we're heading back
to the jungles of Oregon!

1318
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,715
- I want to go back, Grant.
- To him?

1319
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,796
Yes. I'm sorry.

1320
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,391
You haven't begun to be sorry,
you hillbilly harlot!

1321
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,037
Captain Karl, go below with the crew.
I'm taking over.

1322
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,116
Andrew, go get Dr Korman! Go!

1323
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,310
- Get out of my way, Karl!
- But, sir!

1324
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,351
Now I'm in charge!

1325
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:59,155
We're coming about... at full speed ahead!

1326
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,794
- Who is it?
- Dr Death. Let's go.

1327
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,876
We're gonna go get her!

1328
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,275
Come on! Billy's friends'll help us!

1329
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:33,953
- I hope I don't get court-martialled.
- Yeah, I owe you.

1330
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:37,910
- Anything in the manual?
- Not about pulling alongside a ship

1331
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,315
and telling a passenger
you love them, sir.

1332
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:43,318
Put your nose in the manual
and find something, Lucas!

1333
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,314
Whatever you do,
I'm getting off at the next port.

1334
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,079
Don't be ridiculous.
<i>Nobody</i> leaves a Stayton.

1335
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,237
I don't love you any more.
Please try and understand that.

1336
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,316
What has love got to do with marriage?

1337
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:59,636
You'd actually prefer living in squalor
with that cave dweller!

1338
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,433
They should have kept you
in the hospital psycho ward!

1339
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,470
What did you say?

1340
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,830
How did you know that?

1341
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,276
You left me there, didn't you?

1342
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,556
You snake!

1343
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,716
How could you do that?

1344
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,957
How could you be such a slime?

1345
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,990
Call me all the names you want,
but many women adore me!

1346
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,554
Do you wanna know what I was doing?
I'll tell you.

1347
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,877
I was whacking the donkey
with painted ladies. They loved me!

1348
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,669
Yes! I did leave you.

1349
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,917
There! Now I've confessed. So what?

1350
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,157
We're at sea. And I'm a god at sea!

1351
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,798
Nine o'clock in the morning.
This better be good.

1352
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,559
Doctor, Grant's having
another nervous breakdown.

1353
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,990
- He thinks he's God. Keep him busy.
- All right.

1354
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,509
- Morning, Grant.
- Korman, my wife is insane.

1355
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,154
- Do we have a straitjacket?
- I always carry one.

1356
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,952
Good! Put her in it!

1357
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:09,118
You're overwrought, Grant.
I want you to take a Valium.

1358
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,310
Here, take one of mine.

1359
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,355
- Is Nino here?
- Nino on break.

1360
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,358
I have to stop the boat.
My husband's a little bit crazy...

1361
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:19,755
- The captain stop the boat.
- I'm the captain!

1362
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,838
No, please don't salute!
I have to find a red button...

1363
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,156
Vessel sighted straight ahead, sir!

1364
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,477
- Identify.
- There's a fat guy in my way, sir.

1365
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,672
Who you callin' fat, you little weasel!
Come here!

1366
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,475
Where's the thing? I need the red...

1367
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,239
- Here! Here it is!
- No, please!

1368
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,236
- The boat stopped.
- Yes, it stopped!

1369
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,591
- I need to get it turned around.
- Nino on the break.

1370
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,556
He's here!

1371
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,276
He's here! That's him!

1372
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,079
Stop that boat immediately
and let me get my mom!

1373
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,991
- <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>
- Pee Wee Herman.

1374
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:17,352
- <i>Qui est-ce?</i>
- <i>Maman! Qu'est-ce qu'on mange ce soir?</i>

1375
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,869
<i>Come in, Immaculata</i>.

1376
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,158
- He's here!
- There's mutiny afoot.

1377
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:33,153
She's at the bottom of this mutiny.
I'm gonna rid myself of this albatross.

1378
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,036
He's here!

1379
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,837
- Go back to New York, Dr Korman.
- Really? Thank you.

1380
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,916
- Dean!
- Madam! The ship has stopped.

1381
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,996
What happened? Did he strike you?

1382
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,237
- Did he make you do something?
- No! Everything's wonderful.

1383
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:05,069
- Message over the radio, sir.
- Annie! Ha-ha!

1384
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,670
Looks like the fun's over. We've got some
salmon poachers fishing in illegal waters.

1385
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,711
That takes precedence
over your friend's love life.

1386
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,115
- Come about!
- Son, no more radio.

1387
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:16,152
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a... Hey!

1388
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,714
- Billy, what's goin' on?
- We're turnin' round.

1389
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,751
They're going after salmon poachers.

1390
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,078
He's leaving. Where's he going?

1391
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,356
- Catarina!
- Arturo!

1392
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,597
I'm coming!

1393
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:52,713
- Man overboard!
- Shit! Sound the horn.

1394
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,037
Coming about again, Czapowskyj.

1395
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,628
Annie!

1396
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,990
Oh, no, madam. I cannot let you do this!

1397
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,680
- What?
- Not without a lifejacket.

1398
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,510
Dean! I'm coming!

1399
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:09,837
Madam, you really should
play a little hard to get.

1400
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,110
Tell my mother I'll call her!

1401
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:18,153
Woman overboard!
She's wearing an evening dress, sir.

1402
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,953
Get those kids out of the rescue boat.
Let's go!

1403
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,469
My mom's out there! Let me...

1404
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,636
Halt! You treasonous tramp!

1405
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,558
Conspiring with the enemy
at sea is mutiny!

1406
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,713
Pull!

1407
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,796
<i>Another man overboard!</i>

1408
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,191
I am giving my notice, sir!

1409
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:52,869
- Annie!
- Oh, Dean!

1410
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,318
Annie!

1411
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,393
I love you! I'll never leave you again!

1412
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,637
I'll never let you go!
You're my Annie. You always will be.

1413
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,748
Man overboard
is kissing woman overboard.

1414
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,710
Our rescue boat is starboard.

1415
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:32,391
The guy with the arrows
is being pulled in at port.

1416
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,034
It's a helluva day at sea, sir.

1417
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,959
- I can't believe you did it.
- Oh, I saw you jump so I jumped.

1418
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,036
No, I don't mean that.

1419
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,594
I can't believe
you gave all that up just for me.

1420
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,950
- I didn't.
- What do... What do you mean?

1421
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,036
Well, the truth is that it's mine.

1422
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,754
The boat, the money, everything.
It's all mine.

1423
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,633
Dean! Dean, it's OK!

1424
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,316
Oh! Did you tell 'em?

1425
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,237
Yeah.

1426
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,477
- They're making out their Christmas lists.
- Oh, already?

1427
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,196
How do you spell Porsche?

1428
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:19,276
They got me thinking, though.

1429
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,753
What can I possibly give you, ever,
that you don't already have?

1430
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,716
A little girl.
