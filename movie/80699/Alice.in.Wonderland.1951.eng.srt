1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,912
Alice in Wonderland

2
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:27,185
How do you get to Wonderland

3
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,437
Over the hill or under land

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,645
Orjust behind the tree

5
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:40,106
When clouds go rolling by

6
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,274
They roll away and leave the sky

7
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:48,233
Where is the land beyond the eye

8
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:51,859
That people cannot see

9
00:00:53,277 --> 00:00:56,028
Where can it be

10
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:00,945
Where do stars go

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,655
Where is the grass that blooms

12
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,865
They must be somewhere

13
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:13,449
In a sunny afternoon

14
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:20,118
Alice in Wonderland

15
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:25,162
Where is the path to Wonderland

16
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:33,123
Over the hill or here or there

17
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:38,875
I wonder

18
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,958
Where

19
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,923
''...for if he does
and had been of late...

20
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:04,258
''much accustomed to
usurpation and conquest.

21
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:08,385
''Edwin and Morcar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria,

22
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:12,511
declared for him,
and even Stigand--''

23
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:15,512
- Alice.
- Hmm?

24
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:18,513
- Oh, I'm listening.
- ''And even Stigand,

25
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,472
''the Archbishop of Canterbury,
agreed to meet with William...

26
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,473
and offer him the Crown.''

27
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:28,183
''William's conduct
at first was model--''

28
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:32,934
Alice. Will you kindly
pay attention to your history lesson?

29
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:35,977
I'm sorry, but how can one
possibly pay attention...

30
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,978
to a book with
no pictures in it?

31
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,978
My dear child,

32
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:44,063
there are a great many good books
in this world without pictures.

33
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:47,730
In this world, perhaps,
but in my world,

34
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,315
the books would be
nothing but pictures.

35
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,149
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.

36
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,733
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?

37
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,358
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.

38
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:01,986
If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

39
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,236
Nothing would be
what it is,

40
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,653
because everything would be
what it isn't,

41
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:10,655
and contrariwise,
what it is, it wouldn't be.

42
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,322
And what it wouldn't be,
it would.

43
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:16,073
You see?

44
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:19,448
In my world, you
wouldn't say ''meow.''

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,117
You'd say,
''Yes, Miss Alice.''

46
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,326
Oh, but you would. You'd be
just like people, Dinah.

47
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,785
And all the other
animals too.

48
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:30,786
Why, in my world:

49
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:33,036
Cats and rabbits

50
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:37,330
Would reside in
fancy little houses

51
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:41,790
And be dressed in shoes
and hats and trousers

52
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:48,041
In a world
of my own

53
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:50,293
All the flowers

54
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:54,627
Would have very
extra-special powers

55
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:56,919
They would sit
and talk to me

56
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,546
For hours
when I'm lonely

57
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,338
In a world
of my own

58
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,506
There'd be new birds

59
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:11,800
Lots of nice and friendly
how-de-do birds

60
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:17,010
Everyone would have
a dozen bluebirds

61
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:20,011
Within that world

62
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,511
Of my own

63
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,721
I could listen

64
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:27,221
To a babbling brook

65
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:33,222
And hear a song that
I could understand

66
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,348
I keep wishing

67
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,892
It could be that way

68
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,976
Because my world would be

69
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,769
A wonderland

70
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:03,983
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit
with a waistcoat-- and a watch!

71
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,567
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

72
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:11,194
Now this is curious. What could
a rabbit possibly be late for?

73
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,820
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late

74
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,738
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye

75
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:20,197
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,114
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!

77
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,033
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue

78
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm really in a stew
No time to say goodbye, Hello
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late

79
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:35,619
My. What a peculiar place
to have a party.

80
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,162
You know, Dinah,
we really shouldn't...

81
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:42,162
um-- be doing this.

82
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:47,831
After all,
we haven't been invited,

83
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,874
and curiosity often
leads to trouble.

84
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,916
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

85
00:05:56,876 --> 00:06:00,585
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!

86
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,587
Oh.

87
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,046
Well, after this, I shall
think nothing of fall--

88
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,380
Oh. Of falling down stairs.

89
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,765
Oh!

90
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,390
Ahh.

91
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:49,643
Whoa!

92
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:52,893
Goodness. What if I
should fall right through...

93
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:55,520
the centre of the earth--

94
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:58,561
Oh! And come out
the other side...

95
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,854
where people walk
upside down?

96
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:04,855
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody-- Oh!

97
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:12,359
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!

98
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:15,526
Please!

99
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,615
Curiouser and curiouser!

100
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:40,867
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.

101
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,993
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.

102
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:48,745
- You see, I was following--
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?

103
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,329
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?

104
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:55,580
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?

105
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:59,289
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit,
so, um, if you don't mind--

106
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:01,249
Eh? Oh!

107
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,668
- There he is! I simply
must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.

108
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,918
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.

109
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,043
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.

110
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:16,545
- Why don't you try
the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!

111
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,922
Read the directions and directly you'll
be directed in the right direction.

112
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:23,005
''Drink me.''

113
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,216
Hmm. Better look first,
for if one drinks much...

114
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,591
from a bottle
marked ''poison,''

115
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,926
it's almost certain to disagree
with one sooner or later.

116
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,844
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself
some good advice.

117
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,928
But-- Mmm.

118
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,596
Tastes like, uh,
cherry tart.

119
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:48,931
Custard, pineapple,
roast turkey. Goodness!

120
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,473
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

121
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:55,016
You almost went out
like a candle.

122
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,100
But look!
I'm just the right size.

123
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,351
Oh, no use.

124
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,436
I forgot to tell you.

125
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,436
I'm locked!

126
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,812
Oh, no!

127
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,604
Uh, but of course, uh,
you've got the key, so--

128
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:13,605
- What key?
- Now don't tell me
you've left it up there.

129
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,606
Oh, dear.

130
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,193
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.

131
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,444
Oh!

132
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:33,546
''Eat me.'' All right,
but goodness knows what this will do.

133
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, oh!

134
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,339
What did you say?

135
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:44,549
I said, ''A little of that
went a long way.''

136
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,925
Well, I don't think
it's so funny.

137
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:51,050
Now-- Now I shall
n-never get home!

138
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,718
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.

139
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,095
I know, but I-I--

140
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,637
I just can't--
I can't stop!

141
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,972
Come! Oh! Say,
this won't do.

142
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:11,057
It won't do at all.

143
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,642
You! You up there!
Stop!

144
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,642
I say! Oh, look!

145
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:18,310
The bottle. The bottle!

146
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:32,565
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.

147
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,568
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

148
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:45,026
How I love to sail
on the bounding sea

149
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,194
And I never, never, ever
do a thing about the weather

150
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,820
For the weather never, ever
does a thing for me

151
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:53,321
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

152
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,739
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee

153
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,906
And I never, ev--
Ahoy!

154
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,949
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!

155
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,158
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?

156
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:07,160
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.

157
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:10,036
Have you in port
in no time at all.

158
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,578
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!

159
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:16,704
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!

160
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,622
Um, uh, uh, pardon me,
but, uh,

161
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:26,540
would you mind
helping me, please?

162
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:29,500
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

163
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:32,667
Help me. Please!
Won't you--

164
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,420
Help me!

165
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:42,587
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

166
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:45,629
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

167
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:48,756
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

168
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,132
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop

169
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:55,174
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay

170
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:58,176
That's all they did tomorrow
but you finished yesterday

171
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,676
Round and round and round
we go until forevermore

172
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:04,678
Once we were behind
but now we find we are be--

173
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:07,845
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

174
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:11,013
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

175
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,765
Ah, backward--
I say! You'll never get dry that way.

176
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:17,515
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.

177
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,807
First rule of
a caucus race, you know.

178
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,809
But how can I--

179
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:26,143
That's better. Have you
dry in no time now.

180
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,685
No one can ever
get dry this way.

181
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,395
Nonsense! Why, I'm
as dry as a bone already.

182
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:35,479
- Yes, but--
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.

183
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:38,563
Look lively.

184
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:42,565
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit--

185
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,274
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.

186
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,275
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.

187
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,901
- I'm late, I'm late.
- Don't step on the fish!
Uh, w-w-watch it there.

188
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:53,109
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well--

189
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,779
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.

190
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,571
Oh, dear, I'm sure
he came this way.

191
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,947
Do you suppose
he could be hiding?

192
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,323
Hmm.

193
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:10,991
Not here.

194
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:12,991
I wonder.

195
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,370
No, I suppose
he must've--

196
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:28,413
Oh! Why, what peculiar
little figures.

197
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:33,539
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

198
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:36,541
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

199
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,084
Contrary to wax, if you think
we're alive, you ought to speak to us.

200
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:50,879
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.

201
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,879
Goodbye.

202
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,880
You're beginning backwards.

203
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,464
Aye, the first thing
in a visit is to say:

204
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:00,799
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands

205
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,967
How do you do and shake hands
and state your name and business

206
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,969
- That's manners.
- Really?

207
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:11,135
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm
following a white rabbit, so--

208
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:14,886
-No, you can't go yet.
-No, the visit has just started.

209
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:18,846
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?

210
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,806
- Or ''Button, button,
who's got the button''?
- No, thank you.

211
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,473
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

212
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,475
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

213
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,184
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

214
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:35,977
- Why?
- Well, I-I'm curious to know
where he's going.

215
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:38,311
Oh, she's curious.

216
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,604
The oysters were curious,
too, weren't they?

217
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:45,605
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

218
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,690
- Poor things.
- Poor things.

219
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:52,148
Why? What did happen
to the oysters?

220
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,817
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.

221
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,818
No, no, you're in
much too much of a hurry.

222
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:01,277
- Well, perhaps I could
spare a little time.
- You could?

223
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,820
Well!

224
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,654
''The Walrus
and the Carpenter.''

225
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:10,488
Or ''The Story of
the Curious Oysters.''

226
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:19,241
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might

227
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:23,617
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright

228
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,493
And this was odd
because it was

229
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,910
The middle of the night

230
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,913
The walrus
and the carpenter

231
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:41,123
Were walking close at hand

232
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,124
The beach was wide
from side to side

233
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,207
But much too full of sand

234
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,667
Mr Walrus
said the carpenter

235
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,792
My brain begins to perk

236
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:52,210
We'll sweep this clear
in half a year

237
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:54,210
If you don't mind the work

238
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:56,879
Work!

239
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:59,546
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said

240
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,547
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax

241
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,547
And cabbages and kings

242
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,883
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

243
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:13,508
Calloo, callay
No work today

244
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:16,885
We're cabbages and kings

245
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:51,854
Oh, uh, oysters, come out
and walk with us.

246
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:54,355
The day is warm and bright.

247
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,939
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk,

248
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,565
would be a sheer delight.

249
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,525
Yes, and should we
get hungry on the way,

250
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:04,984
we'll stop and, uh,
have a bite.

251
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,777
But Mother Oyster
winked her eye

252
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:13,111
And shook her heavy head

253
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:15,862
She knew too well
this was no time

254
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,614
To leave her oyster bed

255
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:21,864
The sea is nice
Take my advice

256
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:24,947
-And stay right here
- Mum said

257
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,407
Yes, yes, of course, of course,
but, uh, ha-ha!

258
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,408
The time has come
my little friends

259
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,868
To talk of other things

260
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,869
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings

261
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:41,536
And why the sea is boiling hot
and, uh, whether pigs have wings

262
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:45,954
Calloo, callay
Come run away

263
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,873
With cabbages and kings

264
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,804
Well, now, uh,
let me see.

265
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,680
Ah! A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.

266
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:45,265
Listen, how 'bout some pepper
and salt and vinegar, eh?

267
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,101
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.

268
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,310
Now, if you're ready,

269
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:55,311
oysters, dear,

270
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:59,270
we can begin the feed.

271
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,064
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh--

272
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:05,731
The time has come my little friends
to talk of food and things

273
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:09,315
Of peppercorns and mustard seed
and other seasonings

274
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,691
We'll mix 'em all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings

275
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,610
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today

276
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:20,444
Like cabbages and kings

277
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,821
I, uh-- I-I weep for you.

278
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:31,323
I-- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.

279
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:33,740
For I've enjoyed
your company...

280
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:37,449
oh, much more
than you realize.

281
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,575
Little oysters.
Little oysters.

282
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,494
But answer there came none

283
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:46,619
And this was scarcely
odd because

284
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:50,454
They'd been eaten, every one

285
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:54,789
Well, uh--

286
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:58,581
The time has come!

287
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:10,043
With cabbages

288
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:13,712
And kings

289
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,753
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.

290
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:19,130
Aye, and there's
a moral to it.

291
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:22,464
Oh, yes, a very good moral,
if you happen to be an oyster.

292
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:25,589
- Well, it's been a very nice visit--
- Another recitation.

293
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,716
- I'm sorry, but--
- Entitled ''Father William.''

294
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,717
- But really, I'm--
- First verse.

295
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,259
You are old, Father William
the young man said

296
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,552
And your hair
has become very white

297
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,677
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head

298
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:38,845
Do you think at your age
it is right, it's right

299
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:41,220
Do you think at your age
it is right

300
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:45,514
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son

301
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:47,681
I'd do it again
and again and again

302
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:50,015
And I've done it again
and again and again

303
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,899
I wonder who lives here.

304
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:04,193
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?

305
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,277
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!

306
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:09,028
Mary Ann!

307
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:12,029
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.

308
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:14,405
Excuse me, sir, but--
but I've been trying to--

309
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:16,947
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?

310
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:20,282
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something.
Stand there. No, no! Go, go!

311
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,991
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?

312
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,741
- That's just what I--
- My gloves!

313
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,076
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.

314
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,493
I suppose I'll be taking
orders from Dinah next.

315
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,995
Hmm. Now let me see.

316
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:39,663
If I were a rabbit, where
would I keep my gloves?

317
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:41,997
Oh! Thank you.

318
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,665
Don't mind if I do.

319
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,499
Oh, no, no, not again.

320
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:55,334
Oh! Mary Ann!

321
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:01,837
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!

322
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,214
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!

323
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:11,673
No! Help!

324
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:14,840
Monster! Help! Assistance!

325
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,260
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!

326
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,677
- In my house, Dodo. Oh,
my poor little-bitty house.
- The dodo.

327
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,679
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't
be as bad as all that, you know.

328
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:33,388
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and-- There it is!

329
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:37,098
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?

330
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:39,307
Well, do something, Doo-doo.

331
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,433
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary
situation, but, uh--

332
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:45,726
But, but, but, but, but what?

333
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,393
But I have a very
simple solution.

334
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:51,187
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?

335
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,562
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.

336
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:57,480
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.

337
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:59,731
What we need is a-- Uh--

338
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,691
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!

339
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:09,776
Bill! We need a lazard with
a lidder-- A lidder-- A b-b-b---

340
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,401
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.

341
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:15,277
Bill, me lad, have you
ever been down a chimney?

342
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,028
Why, governor, I've been
down more chimneys--

343
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:21,780
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney...

344
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:23,821
and haul that monster
out of there.

345
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,323
Righto, governor.
Monster?

346
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:37,367
Steady now. There.
That's better.

347
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:41,286
Bill, lad, you're passing up
a golden opportunity.

348
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,536
- I am?
- You can be famous.

349
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,745
- I can?
- Of course!

350
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:48,747
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.

351
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,456
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail...

352
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,581
around the monster's neck
and drag it out.

353
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:57,916
- B-But-But, governor--
- Good luck, Bill.

354
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:14,046
Well, there goes Bill.

355
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,589
- Poor Bill.
- Uh,

356
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:21,548
perhaps we should try
a-a more energetic remedy.

357
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,674
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!

358
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:27,675
Oh, I-I propose
that we, uh--

359
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,968
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh--

360
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,968
Oh!

361
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:36,220
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.

362
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:38,763
Yes. Burn the house-- What?

363
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,055
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!

364
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:43,555
Oh, we'll smoke
the blighter out

365
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,598
We'll put the beast to rout

366
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,598
Some kindling
A stick or two

367
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:51,058
Ah, this bit of rubbish
ought to do

368
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:54,060
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out

369
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:58,520
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!

370
00:24:58,603 --> 00:25:02,020
Oh, we'll roast
the blighter's toes

371
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:04,020
We'll toast
the bounder's nose

372
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:06,313
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear

373
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:09,397
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.

374
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:12,148
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?

375
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:16,816
Without a single doubt
we'll smoke the monster out

376
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,401
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!

377
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,443
My poor house
and furniture.

378
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:24,236
Oh, dear.
This is serious.

379
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,070
I simply must-- Ah!
A garden.

380
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:32,238
Perhaps if I ate something,
it would make me grow smaller.

381
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,364
Let go! Help!

382
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:38,240
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you--

383
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:42,033
You barbarian!
Help!

384
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:45,743
Monster!

385
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,910
Help!

386
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:51,202
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.

387
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:53,745
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?

388
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:57,121
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

389
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,872
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.

390
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,707
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but--

391
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,249
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.

392
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,583
Well, can't have
monsters about.

393
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,959
Jolly well have to
carry on alone.

394
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:19,086
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!

395
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:24,172
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

396
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:27,589
Why, what curious
butterflies.

397
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,881
You mean
bread-and-butterflies.

398
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,966
Oh, yes,
of course, uh-- Hmm?

399
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,591
Now who do you suppose--

400
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:45,262
A horsefly! I mean,
a-a rocking horsefly.

401
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:48,304
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon,

402
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:50,596
but, uh, did you--

403
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:54,473
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

404
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,849
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

405
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:59,309
If there's anyone
worth talking to.

406
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:01,475
Or about.

407
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,768
- And we sing too.
- You do?

408
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:06,603
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
''Tell It to the Tulips''?

409
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:10,353
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about
the shy little violets.

410
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:13,771
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do ''Lovely Lily of the Valley.''

411
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,272
- How 'bout a daisy duet?
- Oh, she wouldn't like that.
- Oh, watch the rose.

412
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:21,232
Girls! We shall sing
''Golden Afternoon.''

413
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:23,899
That's about all of us.

414
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:26,191
Sound your ''A,'' Lily.

415
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:28,651
La

416
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:30,484
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi

417
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,152
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

418
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,986
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

419
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,904
Dum du dum-dum

420
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:48,116
Little bread-and-butterflies
kiss the tulips

421
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:52,075
And the sun is like
a toy balloon

422
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,118
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories

423
00:27:56,202 --> 00:28:00,287
In the golden afternoon

424
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,246
There are dizzy daffodils
on the hillside

425
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,289
Strings of violets
are all in tune

426
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:12,540
Tiger lilies
love the dandelions

427
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,333
In the golden afternoon

428
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:18,375
The gold afternoon

429
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,585
There are
dog- and cat-erpillars

430
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:22,668
And a copper centipede

431
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:25,378
Where the lazy daisies

432
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:28,046
Love the very

433
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:31,755
Peaceful life

434
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:37,506
They lead

435
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,508
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

436
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:44,550
For especially
in the month ofJune

437
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,551
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth

438
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:50,636
Of happiness
and romance

439
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,262
All in the golden

440
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:56,930
Afternoon

441
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:19,979
All in the golden afternoon

442
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:26,314
The golden afternoon

443
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:32,025
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

444
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:37,443
For especially
in the month ofJune

445
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,860
There's a wealth
of happiness

446
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,236
And romance

447
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,737
All--

448
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:50,613
The golden afternoon

449
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:59,826
Ah

450
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:07,328
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.

451
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:10,120
What kind of garden
do you come from?

452
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:11,787
Oh, I don't come
from any garden.

453
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:14,121
Do you suppose
she's a wild flower?

454
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:17,205
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.

455
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:21,249
Just what specie-- or shall we
say genus-- are you, my dear?

456
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:23,249
Well, I suppose
you'd call me...

457
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,625
a Genus Humanus Alice.

458
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,127
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?

459
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,836
Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?

460
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,337
Yes. And did you
notice her petals?

461
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,796
What a peculiar colour.

462
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,297
And no fragrance.

463
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,422
Just look at those stems.

464
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,422
Rather scrawny, I'd say.

465
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,340
I think she's pretty.

466
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,758
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.

467
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,259
Aha!Just as I suspected.

468
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:56,635
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.

469
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,760
Oh, no!

470
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,512
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:

471
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:04,720
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.

472
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:08,222
- Well, you wouldn't
expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?

473
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:11,390
-Well, goodness!
-Don't let her stay here and go to seed.

474
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:13,933
- Go on now. Don't you take root--
- Please, girls!

475
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:16,600
We don't want weeds
in our bed.

476
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:19,268
Move along, move along.

477
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:27,395
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.

478
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:31,605
If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.

479
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,106
And I guess
that would teach you.

480
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:43,483
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers.

481
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,277
Hm! Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.

482
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:54,446
A

483
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:58,113
E-I-O-U

484
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:02,865
A-E-I-O-U

485
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:07,533
A-E-I-O-U

486
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,910
Who

487
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:17,494
U-E-I-O-A

488
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:22,788
U-E-I-A

489
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:28,498
A-E-I-O-U

490
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:40,502
Who are you?

491
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:43,378
Well, I-I-I
hardly know, sir.

492
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,337
I've changed so many times
since this morning, you see--

493
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:49,005
I do not see.

494
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:50,797
Explain yourself.

495
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:53,590
I'm afraid I can't
explain myself, sir,

496
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:56,090
because I'm not myself,
you know.

497
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,091
I do not know.

498
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:02,301
Well, I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.

499
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:06,511
You? Who are you?

500
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:09,346
Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...

501
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:15,430
who you are first?

502
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:18,349
Why?

503
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:21,599
Oh, dear, everything
is so confusing.

504
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:24,433
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.

505
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:28,518
- Why?
- Well, I can't remember
things as I used to, and--

506
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:31,227
- Recite.
- Hmm?

507
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,770
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um--

508
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:37,854
How doth the little
busy bee improve each shin--

509
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:40,605
Stop.

510
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:42,773
That is not spoken
correct-ically.

511
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,773
It goes:

512
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,691
How--

513
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,303
How doth
the little crocodile...

514
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,803
improve his shining tail...

515
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:05,055
and pour the waters
of the Nile...

516
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:08,138
on every golden scale?

517
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:11,473
How cheer--

518
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:14,807
How cheer--

519
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,227
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

520
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,478
How neatly
spreads his claws...

521
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:29,145
and welcomes
little fishes in...

522
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,481
with gently smiling jaws.

523
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:36,315
Well, I must say I've never
heard it that way before.

524
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,316
I know.
I have improved it.

525
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,942
Well-- If you ask me--

526
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:45,192
You? Heh!

527
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:47,777
Who are you?

528
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:57,071
Oh!

529
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:07,658
Uh, you there. Girl!

530
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:10,368
Wait! Come back!

531
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,576
I have something
important to say.

532
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,370
Oh, dear.

533
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:18,662
I wonder what
he wants now.

534
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,833
Well?

535
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:36,167
Keep your temper.

536
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,168
- Is that all?
- No.

537
00:35:42,336 --> 00:35:46,254
Exact-ically what
is your problem?

538
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:49,130
Well, it's exact-ically--
exact-ical--

539
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,589
Well, it's precisely this:

540
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:54,090
I should like to be
a little larger, sir.

541
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:57,173
- Why?
- Well, after all,

542
00:35:57,258 --> 00:35:59,633
three inches is such
a wretched height--

543
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:02,552
I am exact-ically
three inches high!

544
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:05,386
And it is a very good
height indeed!

545
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:11,262
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't...

546
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:13,263
shout!

547
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:19,764
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have
a few more helpful hints.

548
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,099
One side will make you
grow taller.

549
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:26,850
- One side of what?
- And the other side will
make you grow shorter.

550
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,184
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!

551
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:35,353
Hmm.

552
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:43,230
One side will
make me grow--

553
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:45,356
But which is which?

554
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:49,983
Hmm. After all
that's happened, I--

555
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:52,693
I wonder if I--
I don't care.

556
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:57,610
I'm tired of being
only three inches high.

557
00:36:57,694 --> 00:37:01,111
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

558
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,366
A serpent! Help!

559
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:15,700
Help! Serpent! Serpent!

560
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:17,700
Oh, but please, please!

561
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:21,743
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!

562
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:25,578
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser-- Indeed?

563
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:29,036
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.

564
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,455
Little? Ha! Little?

565
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,330
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.

566
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,915
And I suppose you
don't eat eggs either.

567
00:37:42,785 --> 00:37:46,327
- Yes, I do, but, but, but--
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.

568
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,911
Serpent. Serpent!

569
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:51,620
Oh, for goodness' sake.

570
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:55,704
Hmm! And the
other side will--

571
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:57,538
The very idea.

572
00:37:57,623 --> 00:38:00,915
Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.

573
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:14,587
Goodness. I wonder if I'll
ever get the knack of it.

574
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:24,673
There. That's much better.

575
00:38:25,924 --> 00:38:28,341
Hmm. Better save these.

576
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:35,510
Now let's see.
Where was I?

577
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:41,845
Hmm. I-- I wonder
which way I ought to go.

578
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:45,263
'Twas brillig

579
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:47,264
And the slithy toves

580
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:51,431
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

581
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:55,641
All mimsy
were the borogroves

582
00:38:55,725 --> 00:39:00,268
And the mome raths
outgrabe

583
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:03,309
Now where in the world
do you suppose that--

584
00:39:03,394 --> 00:39:05,644
- Lose something?
- Oh!

585
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,854
Oh, uh-- I--
I was-- N-No.

586
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:11,146
I-I-I mean, I-I was
just wondering--

587
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,522
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.

588
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,940
Ooh.

589
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,358
Second chorus.

590
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,025
'Twas brillig

591
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,151
And the slithy toves

592
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:30,153
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

593
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:32,695
Why-- Why, you're a cat.

594
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,864
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy

595
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:39,030
Were the borogroves

596
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:42,322
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.

597
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:44,615
There you are.
Third chorus.

598
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,657
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but--

599
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:49,284
But I just wanted to ask you
which way I ought to go.

600
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,034
Well, that depends...

601
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:55,243
on where you want
to get to.

602
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,744
Oh, it really doesn't matter,
as long as I--

603
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,871
Then it really
doesn't matter...

604
00:40:00,954 --> 00:40:03,329
which way you go.

605
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:11,249
And the mome raths outgrabe

606
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:16,334
Oh, by the way.

607
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:18,918
If you'd really
like to know,

608
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,502
he went that way.

609
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,712
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.

610
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:27,087
- He did?
- He did what?

611
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,838
- Went that way.
- Who did?

612
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:31,214
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?

613
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:35,299
But didn't you just say--
I mean-- Oh, dear.

614
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:37,591
Can you stand
on your head?

615
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:40,925
- Oh!
- However,

616
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:45,218
if I were looking
for a white rabbit,

617
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:47,886
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

618
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,596
The Mad Hatter? Um,
no, no, I-I don't think--

619
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,846
Or there's the March Hare...

620
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,139
in that direction.

621
00:40:57,222 --> 00:41:00,098
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.

622
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:03,348
Of course,
he's mad too.

623
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:06,142
Oh, but I don't want
to go among mad people.

624
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:08,893
Oh, you can't help that.

625
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:11,143
Most everyone's mad here.

626
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:18,396
You may have noticed...

627
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,689
that I'm not
all there myself.

628
00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:29,983
And the mome raths
outgrabe

629
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:33,776
Goodness. If the people
here are like that, I--

630
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,943
I must try
not to upset them.

631
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:40,987
How very curious.

632
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:44,488
If there are no objections
let it be unanimous

633
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:48,238
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
-A very merry unbirthday

634
00:41:48,323 --> 00:41:51,364
A very merry
unbirthday to us

635
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:12,914
A very merry
unbirthday to me

636
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,538
- To who
- To me
- Oh, you

637
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:16,331
A very merry
unbirthday to you

638
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:18,082
- Who, me
- Yes, you
- Oh, me

639
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,208
Let's all congratulate us
with another cup of tea

640
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:24,459
A very merry unbirthday

641
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,959
To

642
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:29,960
You

643
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,421
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.

644
00:42:35,505 --> 00:42:39,381
-No room, no room, no room!
-But I thought there was plenty of room.

645
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:41,756
Ah, but it's very rude to
sit down without being invited.

646
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,466
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.

647
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:49,300
Very, very,
very rude indeed.

648
00:42:49,385 --> 00:42:51,301
Oh, I'm very sorry,

649
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:54,094
but I did enjoy your singing,
and I wondered if you could tell me--

650
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:56,135
You enjoyed our singing?

651
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,679
Oh, what a delightful child.

652
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:03,055
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.

653
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:06,555
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.

654
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,723
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.

655
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:12,141
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

656
00:43:12,225 --> 00:43:14,892
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.

657
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:17,476
My dear child, this is not
a birthday party.

658
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,477
Of course not.

659
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,977
This is an unbirthday party.

660
00:43:23,062 --> 00:43:27,397
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

661
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,939
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept--

662
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:33,398
No. Well. An unbirthday--

663
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:36,024
If you have a birthday,
then, you--

664
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:41,067
- She doesn't know
what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!

665
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:44,485
Well, I--

666
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:49,861
I shall elucidate.

667
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:59,906
Now statistics prove
prove that you've one birthday

668
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:02,449
Imagine.:just one
birthday every year

669
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:07,617
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

670
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:10,077
Precisely why we're
gathered here to cheer

671
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,786
Why, then, today is
my unbirthday too.

672
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:16,245
- It is?
- What a small world this is.

673
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:18,871
In that case--

674
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:22,289
-A very merry unbirthday
- To me

675
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:25,082
- To you
-A very merry unbirthday

676
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,165
- For me
- For you

677
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:31,458
Now blow the candle out, my dear
and make your wish come true

678
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:38,585
A very merry unbirthday

679
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,753
To you

680
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:45,796
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat,

681
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,464
How I wonder
what you're at.

682
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:51,465
Up above the world
you fly...

683
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:55,174
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

684
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:59,175
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear,

685
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,594
uh, you were saying that
you would like to seek--

686
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:05,261
Pardon me.

687
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:08,470
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some
information of some kind?

688
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:10,637
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a--

689
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:14,097
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!

690
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:16,348
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up

691
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:19,682
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down

692
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:21,850
Would you like
a little more tea?

693
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:25,601
Well, I haven't had any yet,
so I can't very well take more.

694
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,643
Ah, you mean you can't
very well take less.

695
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:32,353
Yes. You can always
take more than nothing.

696
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:36,104
- But I only meant that--
- And now, my dear,

697
00:45:36,188 --> 00:45:38,772
something, uh, seems
to be troubling you.

698
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:42,023
Uh, won't you tell us
all about it?

699
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:45,357
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.

700
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,151
And when you come
to the end,

701
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:50,151
stop, see?

702
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:52,151
Well, it all started...

703
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:54,736
while I was sitting on
the riverbank with Dinah.

704
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,612
Very interesting.

705
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:01,446
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see--

706
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:04,072
Ah! Cat?

707
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:13,950
- Get the jam. On his nose.
Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.

708
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:17,951
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.

709
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:22,119
My goodness. Those are
the things that upset me.

710
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:24,120
See all the trouble
you've started?

711
00:46:24,204 --> 00:46:26,537
- But really, I didn't think that--
- Ah, but that's the point.

712
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:29,331
- If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.

713
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,998
Move down, move down, move down!

714
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,998
-But I still haven't used--
-Move down, move down, move down

715
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,041
Move down

716
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:39,458
And now, my dear,
as you were saying?

717
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:43,168
Oh, yes. I was sitting
on the riverbank with, uh,

718
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:45,168
with you-know-who.

719
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,294
I do?

720
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:51,588
I mean my c-a-t.

721
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:53,796
Tea?

722
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,963
Just half a cup,
if you don't mind.

723
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,757
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?

724
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:03,300
Why, yes, I'm very
fond of tea, but--

725
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:07,176
If you don't care for tea, you could
at least make polite conversation.

726
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:09,760
Well, I've been trying
to ask you--

727
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:11,801
I have an excellent idea.

728
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:14,053
Let's change the subject.

729
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:19,054
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

730
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:21,430
Riddles?

731
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:23,431
Let me see now.

732
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:27,641
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

733
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:31,308
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?

734
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:35,477
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.

735
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,727
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said--

736
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:41,895
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?

737
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:46,231
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.

738
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,315
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?

739
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:51,524
No, no, no, no. No time,
no time, no time.

740
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:54,107
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.

741
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,483
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.

742
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,567
I'm so very, very late.

743
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:03,485
Well, no wonder you're late. Why,
this clock is exactly two days slow.

744
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,528
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.

745
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:08,987
My goodness.

746
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:12,363
We'll have to look
into this. Aha!

747
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:14,364
I see what's
wrong with this.

748
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:16,990
Why, this watch
is full of wheels.

749
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:21,492
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.

750
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:23,992
- But, but, but, but,
but, but, but, but--
- Butter! Of course!

751
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:26,993
It needs some butter.
Butter!

752
00:48:27,077 --> 00:48:29,994
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?

753
00:48:30,078 --> 00:48:33,078
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.

754
00:48:33,162 --> 00:48:35,788
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.

755
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,038
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?

756
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:42,123
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought
of tea! Of course.

757
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,290
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.

758
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,333
- Sugar?
-Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y-- Two spoons.

759
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:50,126
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!

760
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,252
-Jam?
-Jam! I forgot all about the jam.

761
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:54,544
- No! Not jam!
-Just shows you what a person'll do.

762
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:57,504
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus--

763
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:02,046
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.

764
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:05,172
Lemon-- that's different.
That's-- There.

765
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:07,172
That should do it.

766
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:12,007
- Look at that.
- It's going mad.
- Oh, my goodness.

767
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:14,759
- Oh, dear.
- It's going mad. Mad watch.
- Oh, my goodness.

768
00:49:14,843 --> 00:49:16,759
- I can't understand it.
It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.

769
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:20,094
- Mad watch!
- Oh, look. Do you think the
springs-- Oh, my goodness!

770
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:22,803
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

771
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:28,596
Two days slow.
That's what it is.

772
00:49:28,681 --> 00:49:31,931
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?

773
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,515
And it was an
unbirthday present too.

774
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,308
- Well, in that case.
-A very merry unbirthday

775
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,434
To

776
00:49:41,518 --> 00:49:44,227
- You
- Mr Rabbit.

777
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,269
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh,
now where did he go to?

778
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:50,437
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

779
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:54,230
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

780
00:49:54,313 --> 00:49:56,439
- If there are no objections
let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.

781
00:49:56,523 --> 00:50:01,274
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.

782
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:07,984
Well, I've had
enough nonsense.

783
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:11,610
I'm going home.
Straight home.

784
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:18,113
That rabbit. Who cares
where he's going anyway?

785
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:20,905
Why, if it hadn't
been for him, I--

786
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:23,239
''Tulgey Wood.''

787
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:26,782
Hmm. Curious.

788
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:28,782
I don't remember this.

789
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:34,534
Now let me see.

790
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,162
Oh!

791
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:45,997
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.

792
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,624
Now, if I came this way,

793
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,791
I should go back this way.

794
00:50:57,876 --> 00:50:59,834
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.

795
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:23,426
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.

796
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:27,760
If I-- If I ever
do get home.

797
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:42,640
Oh, uh, excuse me.

798
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,849
Um, could one of you
tell me--

799
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,810
Uh-- Heh-heh. Never mind.

800
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:03,396
Oh, dear. It's getting
dreadfully dark.

801
00:52:03,481 --> 00:52:05,397
And nothing
looks familiar.

802
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,110
I shall certainly be glad
to get out of-- Oh!

803
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:38,741
Who. Who-who.

804
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:42,409
Who. Who-who.

805
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,409
Who.

806
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,911
It would be so nice if something
would make sense for a change.

807
00:52:55,414 --> 00:52:57,665
Oh!

808
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:04,750
''Don't step on
the mome raths.''

809
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:07,833
The mome raths?

810
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:20,047
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.

811
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,423
Ah. I just knew I'd
find one sooner or later.

812
00:53:24,507 --> 00:53:28,049
If I hurry fast, I might even
be home in time for tea.

813
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,342
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah
be happy to see me.

814
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:36,344
Oh, I just can't wait
till I-- Ah!

815
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:54,933
Oh, dear. Now I--

816
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:57,058
Now I shall never get out.

817
00:53:59,143 --> 00:54:02,310
Well, when--
when one's lost,

818
00:54:02,394 --> 00:54:06,436
I-I suppose
it's good advice...

819
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:11,105
to stay where you are
until someone finds you.

820
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:14,231
But-- But who'd ever think
to look for me here?

821
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:20,316
Good advice.

822
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,442
If, If, If, If I'd listened
earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.

823
00:54:24,526 --> 00:54:27,734
But-- But that's just
the trouble with me.

824
00:54:27,819 --> 00:54:30,986
I give myself
very good advice.

825
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:36,154
But I very seldom
follow it

826
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:40,656
That explains

827
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,575
The trouble that
I'm always in

828
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,367
Be patient

829
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:52,202
Is very good advice

830
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:57,120
But the waiting
makes me curious

831
00:54:57,203 --> 00:55:00,537
And I'd love the change

832
00:55:00,621 --> 00:55:03,455
Should something strange

833
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:05,455
Begin

834
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:11,708
Well, I went along
my merry way.

835
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:17,377
And I never stopped
to reason.

836
00:55:19,294 --> 00:55:21,919
I should have known

837
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:24,754
There'd be a price to pay

838
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:27,463
Someday

839
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:30,464
Someday

840
00:55:30,548 --> 00:55:33,715
I give myself

841
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:36,633
Very good advice

842
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:39,800
But I very seldom
follow it

843
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:45,511
Will I ever learn

844
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:48,970
To do the things

845
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:50,970
I should

846
00:55:52,638 --> 00:55:57,431
Will I ever learn

847
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,766
Learn to do the things

848
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:07,350
I should

849
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:18,562
And the mome raths
outgrabe

850
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,563
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!

851
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:24,648
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?

852
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:28,900
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I-I'm through with rabbits.

853
00:56:28,983 --> 00:56:31,775
I wanna go home!

854
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,485
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.

855
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:37,195
That's because
you have no way.

856
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:42,780
All ways here, you see,
are the Queen's way.

857
00:56:42,863 --> 00:56:46,405
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?

858
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:50,782
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!

859
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:54,909
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.

860
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:56,909
And the mome raths
outgrabe

861
00:56:56,992 --> 00:57:00,493
Please, please! Uh,
how can I find her?

862
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:03,495
Well, some go this way.

863
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:05,745
Some go that way.

864
00:57:05,828 --> 00:57:08,496
But as for me, myself,
personally,

865
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,164
I prefer the short cut.

866
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,753
Painting the roses red

867
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:32,753
We're painting
the roses red

868
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:34,754
We dare not stop
or waste a drop

869
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:36,755
So let the paint be spread

870
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:39,631
We're painting
the roses red

871
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:41,839
We're painting
the roses red

872
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:46,674
Oh, painting
the roses red

873
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:48,675
And many a tear we shed

874
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:51,676
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow

875
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,511
In fact
they'll soon be dead

876
00:57:54,594 --> 00:57:58,011
Ohh, and yet
we go ahead

877
00:57:58,096 --> 00:58:02,805
Painting the roses red, red
red, red, red, red, red, red

878
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:06,598
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red

879
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:10,724
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three
why must you paint them red

880
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:13,725
Huh? Oh!

881
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:16,017
Well, the fact is, miss,

882
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:20,811
we planted the white roses
by mistake, and--

883
00:58:20,895 --> 00:58:24,437
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead

884
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:26,437
- She'd raise a fuss
-And each of us

885
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:29,189
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!

886
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:33,607
Since this is
the thought we dread

887
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,941
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.

888
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:38,942
Then let me help you.

889
00:58:39,025 --> 00:58:42,776
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red

890
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,777
Don't tell the Queen
what you have seen

891
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,361
Or say that's what we said but
we're painting the roses red

892
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,737
Yes, painting
the roses red

893
00:58:50,821 --> 00:58:52,862
- Not pink
- Not green
- Not aquamarine

894
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:56,197
We're painting
the roses red

895
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:04,741
- The Queen!
- The Queen!

896
00:59:04,826 --> 00:59:06,742
- Queen!
- The Queen!

897
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:07,762
Cards, halt!

898
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,138
Sound off!

899
01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:11,389
One, two, three,

900
01:00:11,472 --> 01:00:13,389
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, jack!

901
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:19,391
The rabbit.

902
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:26,560
H-H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,

903
01:00:26,644 --> 01:00:32,229
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!

904
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:37,314
- And the King.
- Hooray!

905
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:53,485
Hmm! Who's been
painting my roses red?

906
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:57,361
Who's been painting
my roses red?

907
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:00,071
Who dares to paint
with vulgar paint

908
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:02,572
The Royal flower bed

909
01:01:02,655 --> 01:01:05,864
For painting my roses red

910
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:08,157
Someone will lose his head

911
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,033
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!

912
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,701
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!

913
01:01:13,784 --> 01:01:16,243
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!

914
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:19,077
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!

915
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,328
Off with their heads!

916
01:01:24,662 --> 01:01:27,996
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red

917
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,080
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red

918
01:01:31,165 --> 01:01:33,832
Oh, they're going to
lose their heads

919
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:37,249
Silence!

920
01:01:37,334 --> 01:01:39,500
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying--

921
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:43,919
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now,
uh, uh, let me see, my dear.

922
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:47,252
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?

923
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:50,712
Why, it's a little girl.

924
01:01:50,796 --> 01:01:53,922
- Yes. A-And I was hoping--
- Look up. Speak nicely.

925
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,757
And don't twiddle
your fingers!

926
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,633
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.

927
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:04,175
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:

928
01:02:04,259 --> 01:02:08,260
''Yes, Your Majesty.''

929
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:11,802
''Yes, Your Majesty.''

930
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:17,803
Now, um, where do you come from,
and where are you going?

931
01:02:17,888 --> 01:02:20,096
W-Well, I-I'm trying
to find my way home.

932
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:24,848
Your way? All ways
here are my ways!

933
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:27,767
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking--

934
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:31,893
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.

935
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:34,352
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask--

936
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:36,143
I'll ask the questions!

937
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:39,229
Do you play croquet?

938
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:43,730
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!

939
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:49,106
To your places. To your places. By order
of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

940
01:02:50,482 --> 01:02:52,398
Shuffle deck!

941
01:02:53,441 --> 01:02:57,900
Card cut! Deal cards!

942
01:02:57,984 --> 01:03:00,818
Cards, halt!

943
01:03:32,454 --> 01:03:34,704
Silence!

944
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,684
Off with his head!

945
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:43,309
Off with his head. Off with
his head. By order of the King.
Uh, you heard what she said.

946
01:04:43,394 --> 01:04:47,061
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but--

947
01:04:48,562 --> 01:04:50,895
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

948
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:14,279
Oh!

949
01:05:16,904 --> 01:05:20,196
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible--

950
01:05:20,281 --> 01:05:22,197
Do you want us both
to lose our heads?

951
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:25,158
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.

952
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:01,918
Uh, I say, how are
you getting on?

953
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:04,211
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?

954
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:06,211
I said, not at all!

955
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,671
Who are you talking to?

956
01:06:08,755 --> 01:06:12,172
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?

957
01:06:12,256 --> 01:06:15,214
There. Oh.

958
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:18,340
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child,

959
01:06:18,425 --> 01:06:21,425
if I lose my temper,
you lose your head!

960
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:24,551
Understand?

961
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:29,344
You know, we could make her
really angry. Shall we try?

962
01:06:29,428 --> 01:06:32,054
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.

963
01:06:32,137 --> 01:06:34,637
No, no, no! Stop!

964
01:06:36,097 --> 01:06:38,097
Oh, no!

965
01:06:38,181 --> 01:06:40,264
Oh, my fur and whiskers!

966
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:42,682
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.

967
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:45,349
Someone's head
will roll for this!

968
01:06:47,434 --> 01:06:49,851
Yours!

969
01:06:49,934 --> 01:06:52,852
- Off with her--
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.

970
01:06:52,935 --> 01:06:57,020
Uh, couldn't she have
a trial? Huh? First?

971
01:06:57,104 --> 01:07:02,689
- Trial?
-Well, th--Just a, a little trial? Hmm?

972
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:06,273
Hmm. Very well, then.

973
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:09,274
Let the trial begin!

974
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:22,196
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.

975
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:25,529
Loyal subjects.

976
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:28,030
And the King.

977
01:07:28,114 --> 01:07:32,240
The prisoner at the bar is
charged with enticing Her
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts,

978
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:35,033
into a game of croquet
and thereby willfully...

979
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:38,034
-But--
-and with malice aforethought,
teasing, tormenting...

980
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:40,993
- and otherwise annoying our beloved--
- Never mind all that!

981
01:07:41,077 --> 01:07:43,994
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.

982
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,536
Thereby causing the Queen
to lose her temper.

983
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:52,871
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?

984
01:07:52,955 --> 01:07:55,790
Sentence? Oh, but there
must be a verdict first.

985
01:07:55,873 --> 01:07:59,207
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.

986
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:02,583
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are--

987
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:05,084
Your ways, Your Majesty.

988
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:08,877
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her--

989
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,461
- But consider, my dear.
Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?

990
01:08:11,544 --> 01:08:14,795
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe
one or two? Huh? Maybe?

991
01:08:14,879 --> 01:08:19,089
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!

992
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:22,965
-First witness. First witness.
Herald, call the first witness.
-The March Hare.

993
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:31,300
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know
about this, uh, unfortunate affair?

994
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:33,551
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?

995
01:08:33,635 --> 01:08:37,928
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!

996
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:40,470
Jury, write that down.

997
01:08:43,305 --> 01:08:46,389
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.

998
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:49,515
Silence! Next witness.

999
01:08:49,598 --> 01:08:51,515
The Dormouse.

1000
01:08:56,518 --> 01:08:58,559
- Well--
- Shh!

1001
01:08:58,643 --> 01:09:01,102
What have you to
say about this?

1002
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:05,645
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder--

1003
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:09,772
That's the most important piece
of evidence we've heard yet.

1004
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:12,314
Write that down!

1005
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,148
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.

1006
01:09:15,232 --> 01:09:18,315
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?

1007
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,358
The Mad Hatter.

1008
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:28,944
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!

1009
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:31,987
And, uh, where were you when
this horrible crime was committed?

1010
01:09:32,071 --> 01:09:34,280
I was home drinking tea.

1011
01:09:34,363 --> 01:09:36,989
Today, you know,
is my unbirthday.

1012
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:40,447
Why, my dear, today is
your unbirthday too.

1013
01:09:40,532 --> 01:09:42,657
- It is?
- It is?

1014
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:44,658
It is?

1015
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:47,950
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?

1016
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:50,827
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday

1017
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,827
- For me?
- For you!

1018
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:56,620
Now blow the candle out, my dear,
and make your wish come true.

1019
01:09:59,705 --> 01:10:03,247
A very merry unbirthday

1020
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:06,582
To you

1021
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:08,915
Oh! Your Majesty.

1022
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,750
Uh, yes, my dear?

1023
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,750
Look! There he is now!

1024
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:16,918
- Huh? Wha-- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.

1025
01:10:17,002 --> 01:10:18,918
- Cat!
- Cat?

1026
01:10:19,003 --> 01:10:20,961
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!

1027
01:10:21,045 --> 01:10:24,254
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!

1028
01:10:24,337 --> 01:10:27,130
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.

1029
01:10:27,213 --> 01:10:30,964
-Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
-The jam! The jam! By order of the King.

1030
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:34,257
The jam. Let me have it!

1031
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:43,594
Somebody's head is
going to roll for this!

1032
01:10:43,677 --> 01:10:47,511
- Aha!
- The mushroom.

1033
01:10:47,596 --> 01:10:50,346
Off with her h--

1034
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:57,515
Oh, pooh. I'm not
afraid of you.

1035
01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:01,433
Why, you're nothing
but a pack of cards.

1036
01:11:01,516 --> 01:11:05,726
Rule 42: ''All persons
more than a mile high...

1037
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:07,851
must leave the court
immediately.''

1038
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:11,019
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.

1039
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:14,353
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

1040
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:19,314
And as for you,
Your Majesty--

1041
01:11:19,397 --> 01:11:21,439
Your Majesty indeed.

1042
01:11:21,523 --> 01:11:24,107
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a,

1043
01:11:24,191 --> 01:11:29,400
a fat, pompous, bad-tempered,
old ty-- tyrant.

1044
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:36,444
And, uh, what were you
saying, my dear?

1045
01:11:36,528 --> 01:11:40,905
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.

1046
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:43,405
Off with her head!

1047
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:51,657
You heard what
Her Majesty said.

1048
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,657
Off with her head.

1049
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,833
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again

1050
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:22,501
No one ever loses and
no one can ever win

1051
01:12:22,584 --> 01:12:25,210
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

1052
01:12:25,294 --> 01:12:27,169
- Never let the--
- Off with her head!

1053
01:12:27,252 --> 01:12:29,544
Off with her head!

1054
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:33,296
Just a moment! You can't
leave a tea party without
having a cup of tea, you know.

1055
01:12:33,379 --> 01:12:36,088
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.

1056
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:38,964
You must join us
in a cup of tea.

1057
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,549
Off with her head!

1058
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:48,301
Mr Caterpillar,
what will I do?

1059
01:12:48,384 --> 01:12:50,343
Who are you?

1060
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:56,303
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!

1061
01:12:56,387 --> 01:12:58,638
Off with her head!

1062
01:13:03,389 --> 01:13:06,640
Oh! Still locked, you know.

1063
01:13:06,724 --> 01:13:09,600
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!

1064
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:12,476
- But you are outside.
- What?

1065
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:14,392
See for yourself.

1066
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:16,726
Why-- Why, that's me!

1067
01:13:16,811 --> 01:13:20,186
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!

1068
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:24,687
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!

1069
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:28,355
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!

1070
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:31,315
Alice! Alice. Alice.

1071
01:13:31,398 --> 01:13:33,816
Alice. Alice.

1072
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:37,108
Will you kindly pay attention
and recite your lesson?

1073
01:13:37,192 --> 01:13:42,235
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little
crocodile improve his shining tail?

1074
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:47,070
- And pour the waters of the--
- Alice, what are you talking about?

1075
01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:50,821
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see,
the caterpillar said--

1076
01:13:50,905 --> 01:13:54,656
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.

1077
01:13:54,739 --> 01:13:59,407
Alice, I-- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.

1078
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:04,867
Alice in Wonderland

1079
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:10,993
Over the hill
Or here or there

1080
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:16,955
I wonder where

1081
01:14:29,209 --> 01:14:34,377
Alice in Wonderland

1082
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:38,503

1083
01:14:38,586 --> 01:14:42,671
Over the hill
Or under land

1084
01:14:42,755 --> 01:14:47,423
Orjust behind the tree

1085
01:14:47,506 --> 01:14:52,674
Alice in Wonderland

1086
01:14:52,758 --> 01:14:57,843
Where is the path

01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:03,636
Over the hill
Or here or there

1088
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,512
I wonder where
