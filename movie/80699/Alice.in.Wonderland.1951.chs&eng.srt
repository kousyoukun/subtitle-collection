1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,912
【爱丽丝梦游仙境】
Alice in Wonderland

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,513
你如何前往仙境？
How do you get to Wonderland

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,388
翻过山头，穿过地心？
Over the hill or under land

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,837
或是穿越树林？
Orjust behind the tree

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,198
当云彩从身边掠过
When clouds go rolling by

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,273
渐渐消失在天空
They roll away and leave the sky

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,273
那片遥不可知的土地
Where is the land beyond the eye

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,190
人们无法看清？
That people cannot see

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,949
究竟在哪儿？
Where can it be

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,079
星星都到哪儿去了？
Where do stars go

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,675
还有月亮去了哪儿？
Where is the grass that blooms

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,072
他们一定在某个地方
They must be somewhere

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,631
在阳光灿烂的午后
In a sunny afternoon

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,396
爱丽丝梦游仙境
Alice in Wonderland

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,554
仙境之路在哪里？
Where is the path to Wonderland

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,158
翻过山头 这里或那里
Over the hill or here or there

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,918
我想知道
I wonder

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,389
在哪里
Where

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,923
“…英国也需要有人领导
''...for if he does
and had been of late...

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,158
早已对篡权和征服习以为常
''much accustomed to
usurpation and conquest.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,110
埃德温和莫卡伯爵
都宣布支持他
''Edwin and Morcar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria,

22
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:12,555
甚至连斯蒂甘德…”
declared for him,
and even Stigand--''

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,392
爱丽丝
- Alice.
- Hmm?

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,908
我听着呢
- Oh, I'm listening.
- ''And even Stigand,

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,472
“甚至连坎特伯雷大主教
斯蒂甘德
''the Archbishop of Canterbury,
agreed to meet with William...

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,190
也同意和威廉会晤
并为他加冕
and offer him the Crown.''

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,272
威廉的第一道命令是…”
''William's conduct
at first was model--''

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,717
爱丽丝你能专心上
你的历史课吗？
Alice. Will you kindly
pay attention to your history lesson?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,917
对不起 没有插图的书
I'm sorry, but how can one
possibly pay attention...

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,828
如何让人专心去读呢？
孩子
to a book with
no pictures in it?

31
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:44,152
世界上很多好书
里面都没有插图呀
My dear child,
there are a great many good books
in this world without pictures.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,912
这个世界也许是这样的
In this world, perhaps,
but in my world,

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,315
但是在我的世界里
所有书除了插图没别的
the books would be
nothing but pictures.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,231
你的世界？一派胡言
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,993
现在从头再念一遍
一派胡言？
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,150
没错儿 黛娜
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,239
如果我拥有一个世界
一切都将是胡说八道
If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,711
没有任何事是原来的样子
因为一切都乾坤颠倒
Nothing would be
what it is,
because everything would be
what it isn't,

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,753
全相反
是的东西 都将成为不是
and contrariwise,
what it is, it wouldn't be.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,073
不可能发生的事就一定要发生
明白吗？
And what it wouldn't be,
it would.
You see?

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,429
在我的世界里你不用说
”喵”
In my world, you
wouldn't say ''meow.''

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,432
你会说“是的 爱丽丝小姐”
You'd say,
''Yes, Miss Alice.''

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,431
可是你会的
你会跟人一样 黛娜
Oh, but you would. You'd be
just like people, Dinah.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,988
其他的动物也会说话
And all the other
animals too.

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,752
怎么 在我的世界…
Why, in my world:

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,330
小猫和兔子会住在
可爱的小房子里
Cats and rabbits
Would reside in
fancy little houses

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,394
戴着帽子 穿着鞋和裤子
And be dressed in shoes
and hats and trousers

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,196
在属于我的世界
In a world
of my own

49
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,627
每朵花儿都有神奇的魔力
All the flowers
Would have very
extra-special powers

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:05,338
它们会坐下来与我闲话家常
当我在我的世界里感到寂寞
They would sit
and talk to me
For hours
when I'm lonely
In a world
of my own

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,470
就会有奇珍异鸟
There'd be new birds

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,354
亲切友善地向我问好
Lots of nice and friendly
how-de-do birds

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,079
每个人都会拥有
一群青鸟陪伴
Everyone would have
a dozen bluebirds

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,678
在属于我的世界里
Within that world
Of my own

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,515
我会听到水流潺潺
I could listen
To a babbling brook

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,674
还有我能听懂的歌儿
And hear a song that
I could understand

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,892
我真的希望梦想成真
I keep wishing
It could be that way

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,191
因为我的世界
Because my world would be

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,434
将是美妙的仙境
A wonderland

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,230
哦 黛娜
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit
with a waistcoat-- and a watch!

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,033
那只不过是一只
穿着马甲带着手表的兔子

62
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,754
我的老天爷
我迟到了
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

63
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,674
这就奇怪了
一只兔子会为什么迟到呢？
Now this is curious. What could
a rabbit possibly be late for?

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,820
请等一下 先生
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,738
我迟到了 我迟到了
快赶不上一个重要的约会了
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye

66
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,197
没时间跟你打招呼 再见
我迟到了 我迟到了
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.

67
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,316
这个一定非常重要
也许是个宴会什么的
兔子先生 等一下
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,836
不行 我来不及了
我真的很着急
没时间说再见了
我迟到了 我迟到了
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue
I'm really in a stew
No time to say goodbye, Hello
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,072
真是的 这个宴会的地点
真特别
My. What a peculiar place
to have a party.

70
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,429
你知道 黛娜 我们真的
不应该这样做
You know, Dinah,
we really shouldn't...
um-- be doing this.

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,356
毕竟我们没有受到邀请
After all,
we haven't been invited,

72
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,916
而且好奇心总会惹麻烦
and curiosity often
leads to trouble.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

73
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,237
再见 黛娜 再见
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!

74
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,587
Oh.

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,790
经过了这个 我再也不怕
从楼梯上摔下来了
Well, after this, I shall
think nothing of fall--
Oh. Of falling down stairs.

76
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,765
Oh!

77
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,390
Ahh.

78
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:49,643
Whoa!

79
00:06:49,840 --> 00:07:04,855
天哪 要是我穿过地心
从地球的另一面出来
人们都头冲下走路该怎么办？
不过这也太可笑了吧
没人会…
Goodness. What if I
should fall right through...
the centre of the earth--
Oh! And come out
the other side...
where people walk
upside down?
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody-- Oh!

80
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,526
哦 兔子先生 等等
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!
Please!

81
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
我越来越好奇了
Curiouser and curiouser!

82
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:40,867
对不起
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.

83
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:45,239
没关系
不过你真的拧了我一下
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.

84
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,995
我正在追赶…
很好 什么？拧门把手
- You see, I was following--
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?

85
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,154
拜托了 先生
既然拧了就再拧一下吧
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?

86
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:57,596
我能帮你什么忙？
我正在寻找一只白兔
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?

87
00:07:55,664 --> 00:08:01,249
如果你不介意的话…
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit,
so, um, if you don't mind--
Eh? Oh!

88
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,830
他在那儿
我得过去
- There he is! I simply
must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.

89
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,918
抱歉 你个子太大了
绝对过不去的
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.

90
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,558
你是说不可能
是过不去 不是不可能
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.

91
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,116
为什么不试一试
桌子上的瓶子
- Why don't you try
the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!

92
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,713
桌子？

93
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,192
看一下说明
它会指引你前往正确的方向
Read the directions and directly you'll
be directed in the right direction.

94
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,315
“喝了我”
''Drink me.''

95
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,310
最好先看一下 避免喝下
写着“毒药”的饮料
Hmm. Better look first,
for if one drinks much...

96
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:33,439
不然喝下去迟早会后悔
from a bottle
marked ''poison,''
it's almost certain to disagree
with one sooner or later.

97
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,119
你说什么？
只是提醒一下我自己
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself
some good advice.

98
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,394
可是…
But-- Mmm.

99
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,748
味道好像是樱桃馅饼…
Tastes like, uh,
cherry tart.

100
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,352
…果冻 菠萝 烤火鸡…
Custard, pineapple,
roast turkey. Goodness!

101
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,473
天哪 我做了什么？
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

102
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,269
你差不多可以像一根
蜡烛一样过去
You almost went out
like a candle.

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,477
不过你看 我现在大小刚好
But look!
I'm just the right size.

104
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:04,752
没有用 我忘了告诉你
我被锁住了
Oh, no use.
I forgot to tell you.
I'm locked!

105
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,195
哦 不
Oh, no!

106
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,038
不过钥匙在你那儿
什么钥匙？
别跟我说你把它留在上面了
Uh, but of course, uh,
you've got the key, so--
- What key?
- Now don't tell me
you've left it up there.

107
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,950
哦 亲爱的
Oh, dear.

108
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,444
我该怎么办？
试试那个盒子
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.
Oh!

109
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,550
“吃了我”好吧
''Eat me.'' All right,
but goodness knows what this will do.

110
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,130
不过天晓得吃了以后
我会怎么样
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, oh!

111
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,475
你说什么？
What did you say?

112
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,150
我说“吃一小口
就能起很大作用”
I said, ''A little of that
went a long way.''

113
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,075
我不觉得这有什么好笑的
Well, I don't think
it's so funny.

114
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,357
我现在永远出不去了
Now-- Now I shall
n-never get home!

115
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,960
别哭了 哭也没有用
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.

116
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:03,871
我知道 可我实在忍不住
这样可不行
I know, but I-I--
I just can't--
I can't stop!
Come! Oh! Say,
this won't do.

117
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,429
一点帮助都没有
It won't do at all.

118
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,950
你…不要哭了
你看
You! You up there!
Stop!
I say! Oh, look!

119
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,713
那个瓶子 那个瓶子！
The bottle. The bottle!

120
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,075
我我真希望刚才
没有哭得死去活来
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.

121
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,828
水手的生活就是我的生活
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

122
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,150
我想航行在无边的大海
How I love to sail
on the bounding sea

123
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,629
不怕风 不怕雨
And I never, never, ever
do a thing about the weather

124
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,393
不怕天气的变化
For the weather never, ever
does a thing for me

125
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:55,739
水手的生活就是我的生活
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee

126
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,235
我从来不…
And I never, ev--
Ahoy!

127
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,949
哦 又一个航海的词汇
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!

128
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,595
那有陆地
往哪儿航行 杜杜鸟？
杜杜鸟？
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?

129
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,513
右舷三度
启航
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.

130
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:16,704
马上就会抵达港口
杜杜鸟先生 请你帮帮我
Have you in port
in no time at all.
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!

131
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:26,540
请原谅 不过你能不能
帮帮我？拜托了
Um, uh, uh, pardon me,
but, uh,
would you mind
helping me, please?

132
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:29,500
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

133
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,832
请你帮帮我 能帮帮…
Help me. Please!
Won't you--

134
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,076
…我吗？
Help me!

135
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,916
前进 后退 向内 向外
一起来参加兜圈比赛
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,992
没有什么比兜圈子更无聊
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

137
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,112
后退 前进 向外 向内
从尾到头
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

138
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,550
没有开始
也就没有终结
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop

139
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,518
蹦蹦跳跳 磕磕绊绊
幻想着自由和快乐
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay

140
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,558
明天已经开始
昨天即将结束
That's all they did tomorrow
but you finished yesterday

141
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,030
不停顿地兜圈子 永无止境
Round and round and round
we go until forevermore

142
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,953
我们曾经落后
可我们现在已经领先
Once we were behind
but now we find we are be--

143
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,157
前进 后退 向内 向外
一起参加兜圈子比赛
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

144
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,073
没有什么比兜圈子比赛
更无聊
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

145
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,149
后退…
Ah, backward--
I say! You'll never get dry that way.

146
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,515
那样的话你永远也干不了
干不了？
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.

147
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,233
必须和其他人一起跑
这是兜圈子比赛的第一条规则
First rule of
a caucus race, you know.

148
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,309
可是我该怎么样…？
But how can I--

149
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,551
好多了
你很快就会干了
That's better. Have you
dry in no time now.

150
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,035
这样永远都不会干
No one can ever
get dry this way.

151
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,271
胡说 我已经都干透了
Nonsense! Why, I'm
as dry as a bone already.

152
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,838
是的 可是…
好了 我们来试试
- Yes, but--
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.

153
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,319
打起精神
Look lively.

154
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,748
那只白兔
兔子先生？兔子先生？
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit--

155
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,913
哦 天哪我 迟到了
别走开 我马上就回来
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.

156
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:49,230
我迟到了 我迟到了
别踩到鱼
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.
- I'm late, I'm late.
- Don't step on the fish!
Uh, w-w-watch it there.

157
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,836
小心点儿 别踢那条鲭鱼
好 做得好
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well--

158
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,471
兔子先生 哦 兔子先生
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.

159
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,916
我肯定他走的是这条路
Oh, dear, I'm sure
he came this way.

160
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,036
他是不是躲起来了？
Do you suppose
he could be hiding?

161
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,323
Hmm.

162
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,397
没在这儿
Not here.

163
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,630
我想…
I wonder.

164
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,037
不 我猜他一定是…
好奇怪的小人儿
No, I suppose
he must've--
Oh! Why, what peculiar
little figures.

165
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,949
半斤 八两
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

166
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,953
如果你觉得我们是蜡像
那你得付钱 知道吗
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

167
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,595
如果你觉得我们是活人
就得跟我们说话
Contrary to wax, if you think
we're alive, you ought to speak to us.

168
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,479
这才符合逻辑
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.

169
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,879
很高兴见到你们
再见
Goodbye.

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,871
你把顺序搞反了
和人见面第一句话要说…
You're beginning backwards.
Aye, the first thing
in a visit is to say:

171
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,157
你好吗 然后握手…
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands

172
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,074
你好吗 然后握手…
报上你的大名 说明来意
How do you do and shake hands
and state your name and business

173
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,878
这是礼貌
这是礼貌
- That's manners.
- Really?

174
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,359
真的吗？

175
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,591
我的名字叫爱丽丝
我在追赶一只白兔
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm
following a white rabbit, so--

176
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:24,670
你还不能走
不行 访问才刚刚开始
我实在抱歉
你喜欢玩捉迷藏吗？
或钮扣 钮扣 谁拿了钮扣？
不了 谢谢你们
如果你呆的时间足够长
我们可以玩儿打仗
-No, you can't go yet.
-No, the visit has just started.
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?
- Or ''Button, button,
who's got the button''?
- No, thank you.
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

177
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,475
你们真是好心
可是我一定得走了
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

178
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,035
为什么？
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

179
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,394
因为我要追赶一只白兔
为什么？
我很好奇他要去哪儿
- Why?
- Well, I-I'm curious to know
where he's going.

180
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,592
哦 她很好奇
Oh, she's curious.

181
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,913
以前牡蛎也很好奇
对吧？
The oysters were curious,
too, weren't they?

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,117
对 你还记得它们的下场吗？
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

183
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,068
好可怜的家伙
- Poor things.
- Poor things.

184
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,634
怎么了？牡蛎出了什么事儿？
Why? What did happen
to the oysters?

185
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:02,820
你不会感兴趣的
可我很想听
你还忙着赶路
也许我可以抽点儿时间
你可以吗？好的…
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.
No, no, you're in
much too much of a hurry.
- Well, perhaps I could
spare a little time.
- You could?
Well!

186
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,073
海象与木匠
''The Walrus
and the Carpenter.''

187
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,153
或者 好奇牡蛎的故事
Or ''The Story of
the Curious Oysters.''

188
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:24,072
太阳的光芒照耀在海上
他想尽一切办法
让汹涌的大海平静明亮
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright

189
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,958
这个事情真的很奇怪
And this was odd
because it was

190
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,554
因为时间正好是午夜
The middle of the night

191
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:41,513
海象和木匠在很近的距离内
走着
The walrus
and the carpenter
Were walking close at hand

192
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,593
海滩展开宽阔的胸怀
可是到处都是沙子
The beach was wide
from side to side
But much too full of sand

193
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,715
海象先生？
Mr Walrus
said the carpenter

194
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,034
木匠说

195
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,236
我脑子开始灵光了
My brain begins to perk

196
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,632
如果你不介意
只要半年就能把这里打扫干净
We'll sweep this clear
in half a year
If you don't mind the work

197
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,199
工作？
Work!

198
00:15:56,962 --> 00:16:00,114
时间到了
海象说
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said

199
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,547
谈谈别的事情吧
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax

200
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,117
鞋子 船 封腊
卷心菜和国王
And cabbages and kings

201
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,478
为什么大海如此灼热
猪是否长有翅膀
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

202
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:13,950
卡路 卡雷 今天没工作
Calloo, callay
No work today

203
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,476
我们是卷心菜 是国王
We're cabbages and kings

204
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:52,476
牡蛎们 来吧 和我们一起散步
Oh, uh, oysters, come out
and walk with us.

205
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:54,949
天气晴朗而且温暖
The day is warm and bright.

206
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:59,795
悠闲地散步 愉快地扯淡
一定很快乐
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk,
would be a sheer delight.

207
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,591
如果走着走着肚子饿了
咱们就停下来吃一口
Yes, and should we
get hungry on the way,
we'll stop and, uh,
have a bite.

208
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:18,669
但是牡蛎妈妈眨着眼睛
摇晃着沉重的脑袋
她清楚地知道这个时候
她不该离开她的牡蛎床
“三月”
But Mother Oyster
winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well
this was no time
To leave her oyster bed

209
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,353
大海很美 听我的建议
就留在这儿
妈妈说
The sea is nice
Take my advice
-And stay right here
- Mum said

210
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,152
是的 当然
Yes, yes, of course, of course,
but, uh, ha-ha!

211
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,028
但时间到了 我的小朋友
The time has come
my little friends

212
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,395
我们得说其它事儿了
To talk of other things

213
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:37,519
鞋子 船 封腊
卷心菜和国王
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings

214
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:43,436
为什么大海如此灼热
猪是否长着翅膀
And why the sea is boiling hot
and, uh, whether pigs have wings

215
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:46,398
卡路 卡雷 快点儿来吧
Calloo, callay
Come run away

216
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,790
跟着卷心菜和国王
With cabbages and kings

217
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,231
“海鲜大餐”

218
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:32,509
好了 让我来瞧瞧
Well, now, uh,
let me see.

219
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:38,348
我们需要一块面包
Ah! A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.

220
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:45,265
要不要来，点儿胡椒面
盐巴和醋？
Listen, how 'bout some pepper
and salt and vinegar, eh?

221
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,995
“菜单
牡蛎”
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.

222
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,789
好主意 太棒了

223
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:59,550
亲爱的牡蛎 如果准备好了
我们就开始吃饭了
“今天特价
生蚝大餐”
Now, if you're ready,
oysters, dear,
we can begin the feed.

224
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,914
吃饭？
吃饭？
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh--

225
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,731
对
The time has come my little friends
to talk of food and things

226
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,315
时间到了 我的小朋友
现在该谈谈吃的了
Of peppercorns and mustard seed
and other seasonings

227
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,691
胡椒籽芥末籽还有其他的调料
We'll mix 'em all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings

228
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,610
全都混在一起
调成国王爱吃的调味酱
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today

229
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:21,189
卡路 拉雷 我们今天吃大餐
就像卷心菜和国王
Like cabbages and kings

230
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:28,519
我真为你难过
I, uh-- I-I weep for you.

231
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:31,990
我抱歉 我同情
I-- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.

232
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:50,454
很高兴有你的陪伴
超出你的想象
小牡蛎 小牡蛎
但它们没有一个人回答
这一点儿也不奇怪
因为它们都被吃光了
For I've enjoyed
your company...
oh, much more
than you realize.
Little oysters.
Little oysters.
But answer there came none
And this was scarcely
odd because
They'd been eaten, every one

233
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:54,789
Well, uh--

234
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:59,271
时间到了
The time has come!

235
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:50,015
去见卷心菜和国王
完了
完了
这是个很悲哀的故事
这里面有寓意
这里面有寓意
是的 很好的寓意
如果你是一只牡蛎
这是一次很好的访问
我们再朗诵一首诗
抱歉 不过…
名字叫“威廉父亲”
第一段
您老了 威廉父亲
年轻人说
您的头发全变白了
“但您还是在不断地倒立”
你觉得您这样的年纪合适吗？
“在我年轻的时候”
威廉的父亲回答说
“我不停做一遍又一遍”
With cabbages
And kings
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.
Aye, and there's
a moral to it.
Oh, yes, a very good moral,
if you happen to be an oyster.
- Well, it's been a very nice visit--
- Another recitation.
- I'm sorry, but--
- Entitled ''Father William.''
- But really, I'm--
- First verse.
You are old, Father William
the young man said
And your hair
has become very white
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head
Do you think at your age
it is right, it's right
Do you think at your age
it is right
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son
I'd do it again
and again and again
And I've done it again
and again and again

236
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,671
我想知道谁住在这里？
I wonder who lives here.

237
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:04,988
玛丽安！祖咒那个姑娘
她到底把它们放哪儿了？
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?

238
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,277
玛丽安！
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!

239
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,516
那只兔子
玛丽安！
Mary Ann!

240
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,797
没用 我等不及了
我真的要迟到了 天哪
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.

241
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:15,269
抱歉 先生
不过我一直想…
Excuse me, sir, but--
but I've been trying to--

242
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:17,749
玛丽安
你在这里做什么？
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?

243
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:20,282
玛丽安？
别瞎忙活了 站在那儿
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something.
Stand there. No, no! Go, go!

244
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,349
不 快 快
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?

245
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,741
去给我拿手套来 我迟到了
去哪儿迟到了 我想知道…
- That's just what I--
- My gloves!

246
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,199
我的手套
马上 听到了吗？
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.

247
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:40,119
天哪 我想
下次我得听黛娜的命令
让我想想看
如果我是兔子
我会把手套放在哪儿？
I suppose I'll be taking
orders from Dinah next.
Hmm. Now let me see.
If I were a rabbit, where
would I keep my gloves?

248
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,111
“吃了我
咬一口”
Oh! Thank you.

249
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,555
谢谢 我就不客气了
Don't mind if I do.

250
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,396
哦 不 不 不要再
Oh, no, no, not again.

251
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:55,913
玛丽安！
Oh! Mary Ann!

252
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:02,758
你给我听着 玛丽安
救命！
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!

253
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,214
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!

254
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:11,673
No! Help!

255
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,194
救命！怪物！
Monster! Help! Assistance!

256
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,350
救命！快来帮帮我！

257
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,511
哦 亲爱的
怪物
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!

258
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,831
杜杜鸟 在我的家里有怪物
杜杜鸟？
- In my house, Dodo. Oh,
my poor little-bitty house.
- The dodo.

259
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,229
我可怜的小房子
冷静点儿 老伙计
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't
be as bad as all that, you know.

260
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,676
事情没那么糟
可怜我的房顶和椽子
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and-- There it is!

261
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,098
我的墙壁 在那儿
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?

262
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,307
我的天 确实是这样 对吧？
Well, do something, Doo-doo.

263
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,433
快想想办法 杜杜鸟
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary
situation, but, uh--

264
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,726
好的 没问题
意想不到的情况 不过…
不过什么？
But, but, but, but, but what?

265
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,314
不过我有一个简单的办法
But I have a very
simple solution.

266
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:51,197
谢天谢地
什么办法？
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?

267
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,476
把它从烟囱里拉出来
好主意 那就快拉吧
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.

268
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:58,353
谁？我？别犯傻了
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.

269
00:22:57,564 --> 00:23:00,789
我们需要的是…
What we need is a-- Uh--

270
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,691
…一只拿梯子的蜥蜴
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!

271
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,714
比尔
我们需要一个拿梯子的蜥蜴
Bill! We need a lazard with
a lidder-- A lidder-- A b-b-b---

272
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:13,353
你能帮助我们吗？
很乐意效劳
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.

273
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:16,557
比尔 好小伙子
你钻过烟囱吗？
Bill, me lad, have you
ever been down a chimney?

274
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,915
老爷 我钻过很多烟囱…
Why, governor, I've been
down more chimneys--

275
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:27,957
太好了 你爬进去
把那个怪物给我拽出来
没问题 老爷 怪物？
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney...
and haul that monster
out of there.
Righto, governor.
Monster?

276
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:39,116
别慌
这样就好 比尔…
Steady now. There.
That's better.

277
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:42,029
你可别错过这个大好机会
Bill, lad, you're passing up
a golden opportunity.

278
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:44,190
我吗？
你可以一举成名
- I am?
- You can be famous.

279
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,745
真的吗？
- I can?
- Of course!

280
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,273
当然 有一个勇敢的少年
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.

281
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,397
进去吧 不会有事儿
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail...

282
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,553
只要把你的尾巴拴住
怪物的脖子拉出来就是了
around the monster's neck
and drag it out.

283
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:58,393
可是 老爷
祝你走运 比尔
- B-But-But, governor--
- Good luck, Bill.

284
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:15,035
好了 比尔去了
Well, there goes Bill.

285
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,589
可怜的比尔
- Poor Bill.
- Uh,

286
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:22,514
也许我们应该试一试
更有效的办法
perhaps we should try
a-a more energetic remedy.

287
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:24,670
什么办法都行 只要快
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!

288
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:27,755
我提议我们…
Oh, I-I propose
that we, uh--

289
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,968
说呀
我建议我们…
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh--
Oh!

290
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:37,157
我想好了
我们把房子烧了
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.

291
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:39,754
把房子烧了…？什么？
Yes. Burn the house-- What?

292
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:42,035
不行
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!

293
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:44,475
我们用烟把那个讨厌鬼熏出来
Oh, we'll smoke
the blighter out

294
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,596
把那只野兽赶跑
We'll put the beast to rout

295
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:48,750
只要用一两根柴火
Some kindling
A stick or two

296
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:52,833
一点点儿东西就足够
哦 亲爱的
Ah, this bit of rubbish
ought to do

297
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:54,717
把那个讨厌鬼给熏出来
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out

298
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:58,520
把那个怪物给熏出来
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!

299
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,020
不要烧我漂亮的房子
Oh, we'll roast
the blighter's toes

300
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,020
我们把讨厌鬼的脚趾头烧焦
We'll toast
the bounder's nose

301
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,313
把这个粗鲁之人的鼻子烤熟
把那扇门拿来
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear

302
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,993
得让它清楚地知道
我们这里不欢迎怪物
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.

303
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,310
我的天哪
火柴
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?

304
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,816
火柴？
谢谢
Without a single doubt
we'll smoke the monster out

305
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,401
毫不犹豫
我们把怪物熏出来
我们把怪物熏跑…
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!

306
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:35,390
住手！我可怜的房子和家具
哦 天哪 这很严重
我一定要…花园
或许让我吃点什么
我就能变小
放开！救命！
My poor house
and furniture.
Oh, dear.
This is serious.
I simply must-- Ah!
A garden.
Perhaps if I ate something,
it would make me grow smaller.
Let go! Help!

307
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,153
抱歉 可我必须得吃点什么
别吃我
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you--

308
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,993
你这个野蛮人
You barbarian!
Help!

309
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,743
救命！
怪物！
Monster!

310
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:48,596
救命！
Help!

311
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:52,790
我迟到了 天哪 我来了
我应该赶到那儿 我迟到了
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.

312
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:56,998
我说 你有火柴吗？
我得走了 再见
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?

313
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:59,719
我迟到了
等等！请等一下
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.

314
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,473
小姑娘 你有火柴吗？
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but--

315
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,869
没有 抱歉 兔子先生！
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.

316
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,583
大家都不肯帮忙
Well, can't have
monsters about.

317
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,399
不能让怪物胡来
我只好一个人干了
Jolly well have to
carry on alone.

318
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:20,390
请等一下 就一会儿
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!

319
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:25,076
天哪 我这么小
永远都追不上他
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

320
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:27,589
怎么…什么…
Why, what curious
butterflies.

321
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,948
…好奇的蝴蝶
你是说面包和蝴蝶
You mean
bread-and-butterflies.

322

没错儿 当然了
Oh, yes,
of course, uh-- Hmm?

323
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,156
你觉得是谁…？
Now who do you suppose--

324
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:46,279
马蝇 我是说摇晃的马蝇
A horsefly! I mean,
a-a rocking horsefly.

325
00:26:45,345 --> 00:27:28,651
当然
对不起 不过你…
我一定是疯了
花儿不会说话的
我们当然会说话 亲爱的
如果有值得说话的对象
或者有值得聊的事情
我们还会唱歌
真的？
是的 想听听“向郁金香
倾诉”这首歌吗？
算了 我们还是唱我们自己吧
我们会唱一首害羞的紫罗兰
那首歌太老了
我们还是唱“美丽的铃兰”
雏菊二重唱？
她才不会喜欢那个
姑娘们 我们就唱
“阳光灿烂的午后”吧
那是讲我们大家的
百合 你唱A调
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon,
but, uh, did you--
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.
But of course
we can talk, my dear.
If there's anyone
worth talking to.
Or about.
- And we sing too.
- You do?
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
''Tell It to the Tulips''?
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about
the shy little violets.
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do ''Lovely Lily of the Valley.''
- How 'bout a daisy duet?
- Oh, she wouldn't like that.
- Oh, watch the rose.
Girls! We shall sing
''Golden Afternoon.''
That's about all of us.
Sound your ''A,'' Lily.

346
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:33,278
从花儿的身上你可以学到很多
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

347
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:38,559
尤其是在六月天
For especially
in the month ofJune

348
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:52,075
充满着欢乐和浪漫的气息
所有的…
在阳光灿烂的午后
There's a wealth
of happiness
And romance
All--
The golden afternoon

349
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:59,826
Ah

350
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:09,037
你们唱得真好
谢谢你亲爱的
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.

351
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:11,515
你是从哪个花园来的？
What kind of garden
do you come from?

352
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:15,513
我不是从花园来的
你觉得她是不是一束野花？
Oh, I don't come
from any garden.
Do you suppose
she's a wild flower?

353
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:18,194
不是 我不是野花儿
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.

354
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:22,637
你是什么品种 我们能
这样说吗 亲爱的？
Just what specie-- or shall we
say genus-- are you, my dear?

355
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:49,832
你们就叫我爱丽丝吧
我是人类
你见过开这种爱丽丝
的花儿吗？
好好想想
你看到过爱丽丝吗？
你注意到她的花瓣了吗？
真是奇怪的颜色
而且没有花香
看看这些茎
干巴巴的
我觉得她很漂亮
住嘴 小花蕾
Well, I suppose
you'd call me...
a Genus Humanus Alice.
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?
Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?
Yes. And did you
notice her petals?
What a peculiar colour.
And no fragrance.
Just look at those stems.
Rather scrawny, I'd say.
I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.

356
00:30:49,920 --> 00:31:19,792
可我不是花儿
我猜得没错儿
她只不过是一个平常的
会动的俗物
哦 不
一个平常的什么？
简单地说就是杂草
我不是杂草
她才不会承认自己是杂草
你能想象吗？
天哪
千万别让她在这儿播种
走开 不要在这儿扎根
快走吧
我们的地里不能长杂草
快走吧 走哇
Aha!Just as I suspected.
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.
Oh, no!
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.
- Well, you wouldn't
expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?
-Well, goodness!
-Don't let her stay here and go to seed.
- Go on now. Don't you take root--
- Please, girls!
We don't want weeds
in our bed.
Move along, move along.

357
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:28,188
好吧 如果你们非要这么认为
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.

358
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:33,237
如果恢复了我的正常身高
就把你们每一朵花都摘下来
If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.

359
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:35,629
让你们长点儿记性
And I guess
that would teach you.

360
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:45,077
从花儿的身上可以学到很多
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers.

361
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:49,158
我觉得他们应该学点儿
礼貌才对
Hm! Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.

362
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:58,997
“啊依埃欧悠”
A
E-I-O-U

363
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:09,719
“啊依埃欧悠”
A-E-I-O-U
A-E-I-O-U

364
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:30,196
“欧悠依埃欧啊”
“悠依埃啊”
“啊依埃欧悠”
Who
U-E-I-O-A
U-E-I-A
A-E-I-O-U

365
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:41,315
你是谁？
Who are you?

366
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:45,077
我也不知道 先生
Well, I-I-I
hardly know, sir.

367
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,833
从今天早上起我变了好几次
I've changed so many times
since this morning, you see--

368
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:50,797
我没看到
I do not see.
Explain yourself.

369
00:32:50,800 --> 00:33:11,152
解释给我听听
我想我也没法解释
因为我不是我自己
我不知道
我无法解释清楚
连我自己都糊涂了
你？你是谁？
你是不是应该先告诉我
I'm afraid I can't
explain myself, sir,
because I'm not myself,
you know.
I do not know.
Well, I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.
You? Who are you?
Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...

370
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,312
你是谁？
who you are first?

371
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:18,553
为什么？
Why?

372
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:23,151
哦 亲爱的 一切都乱套了
Oh, dear, everything
is so confusing.

373
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:26,232
不是这样
对我来说是
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.

374
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:29,710
为什么？
以前的事情我记不起来了
- Why?
- Well, I can't remember
things as I used to, and--

375
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:31,227
还有…
背诵
- Recite.
- Hmm?

376
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:35,830
哦 是的 先生
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um--

377
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:39,153
忙碌的小蜜蜂是如何…
How doth the little
busy bee improve each shin--

378
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:41,276
停
Stop.

379
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:45,271
你说得不对
应该是
That is not spoken
correct-ically.
It goes:

380
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,956
如何…
How--

381
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:14,807
小鳄鱼如何擦亮他的尾巴
把尼罗河水倾倒在
金色的鳞片上？
你看…
你看…
How doth
the little crocodile...
improve his shining tail...
and pour the waters
of the Nile...
on every golden scale?
How cheer--
How cheer--

382
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:24,560
你看他笑得多开心
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

383
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,871
伸出的爪子多么整齐
How neatly
spreads his claws...

384
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:30,434
他一边笑一边张开嘴
and welcomes
little fishes in...

385
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,115
把小鱼一口吞下去
with gently smiling jaws.

386
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:37,720
我要说
课文我从来没听说过这么念
Well, I must say I've never
heard it that way before.

387
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:42,942
我知道 因为我改了
哦…
I know.
I have improved it.
Well-- If you ask me--

388
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,158
如果你问我…
你？
你是谁？
You? Heh!
Who are you?

389
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:57,071
Oh!

390
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:08,998
你 小姑娘
Uh, you there. Girl!

391
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:11,753
等等 回来
Wait! Come back!

392
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:14,035
我有重要的事情对你说
I have something
important to say.

393
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,370
哦 亲爱的
Oh, dear.

394
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:20,519
不知道他要干什么
I wonder what
he wants now.

395
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,833
说吧？
Well?

396
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:38,596
不要发脾气
Keep your temper.

397
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:41,752
就这些？
不是
- Is that all?
- No.

398
00:35:42,336 --> 00:35:47,633
你究竟有什么问题？
Exact-ically what
is your problem?

399
00:35:46,338 --> 00:36:07,153
说得准确点儿…
我想变得大一些 先生
为什么
因为三英嫉纳砀
实在是太矮了
我的身高也是三英
这种身高刚刚好
Well, it's exact-ically--
exact-ical--
Well, it's precisely this:
I should like to be
a little larger, sir.
- Why?
- Well, after all,
three inches is such
a wretched height--
I am exact-ically
three inches high!
And it is a very good
height indeed!

400
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:13,436
可我不适应
你没必要大喊大叫
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't...
shout!

401
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:19,764
哦 亲爱的
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have
a few more helpful hints.

402
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,099
顺便说一下
我还有几个更好的建议
One side will make you
grow taller.

403
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,850
一边儿能让你长高
什么一边儿？
- One side of what?
- And the other side will
make you grow shorter.

404
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,279
另外一边儿
会让你变矮
什么另外一边儿
当然是蘑菇了
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!

405
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:35,353
Hmm.

406
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:46,111
一边儿可以让我长高…
可到底是哪一边儿？
One side will
make me grow--
But which is which?

407
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:52,835
经过了这么多的事情
我真不知道…
Hmm. After all
that's happened, I--
I wonder if I--
I don't care.

408
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,956
不管这么多了

409
00:36:55,026 --> 00:37:01,111
我可不想当三寸小人
I'm tired of being
only three inches high.
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

410
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,366
蛇
A serpent! Help!

411
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,114
救命！救命！蛇！蛇！
Help! Serpent! Serpent!

412
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:19,077
拜托了
Oh, but please, please!

413
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:23,199
走开！走开！蛇！蛇！
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!

414
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:28,752
可我不是蛇
真的？那你是什么？
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser-- Indeed?

415
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:32,913
我只是一个小女孩儿
小？小？
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.
Little? Ha! Little?

416
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:37,671
是的 我是说以前是
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.

417
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:41,389
我猜你也不吃蛋吧
And I suppose you
don't eat eggs either.

418
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,327
我吃呀 不过…
我就知道 我就知道
- Yes, I do, but, but, but--
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.

419
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,620
蛇 蛇！
哦 拜托你别叫了
Serpent. Serpent!
Oh, for goodness' sake.

420
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,990
吃下另一边儿就会…
好主意
Hmm! And the
other side will--

421
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,915
花费这么多时间产卵
最后还是让像她这样的蛇吃掉
The very idea.
Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.

422
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,587
天哪 我该怎么
才能抓住诀窍
Goodness. I wonder if I'll
ever get the knack of it.

423
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,673
对 这样就好多了
There. That's much better.

424
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,676
我最好把这些保存起来
Hmm. Better save these.

425
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,510
我们来看看 我刚才在哪儿？
“升高”
Now let's see.
Where was I?

426
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,913
“返回
那边儿”

427
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,314
“往这儿
往那儿”

428
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,516
我真不知道该往哪儿走
Hmm. I-- I wonder
which way I ought to go.

429
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,754
有个滑溜溜很活跃的怪东西
'Twas brillig

430
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,992
在草地上转圈还钻孔
And the slithy toves

431
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:54,278
菠萝鸟毗毛缩脖邋遢又可怜
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

432
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:58,990
绿毛猪回家迷路气得闹哄哄
All mimsy
were the borogroves

433
00:38:55,725 --> 00:39:02,152
那是什么东西…？
And the mome raths
outgrabe

434
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:05,644
你弄丢了什么吗？
没有…
Now where in the world
do you suppose that--
- Lose something?
- Oh!

435
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:14,522
我只是…
不 我是说 我只是在
没关系的
请等一下
Oh, uh-- I--
I was-- N-No.
I-I-I mean, I-I was
just wondering--
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.

436
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,940
Ooh.

437
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,593
第二首合唱

438
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:33,078
有个滑溜溜很活跃的怪东西
在草地上转圈还钻孔
原来你是一只猫
一只妙妙猫
Second chorus.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe
Why-- Why, you're a cat.

439
00:39:33,160 --> 00:40:03,329
菠萝鸟毗毛缩脖邋遢又可怜
等等 请你别走
好吧 第三首合唱
不用唱了 谢谢
我只想问问我该往哪儿走
这要看你想往哪儿去
其实都无所谓 只要我…
那不管往哪儿走全无所谓了
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy
Were the borogroves
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.
There you are.
Third chorus.
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but--
But I just wanted to ask you
which way I ought to go.
Well, that depends...
on where you want
to get to.
Oh, it really doesn't matter,
as long as I--
Then it really
doesn't matter...
which way you go.

440
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:11,249
And the mome raths outgrabe

441
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,334
顺便说一下
Oh, by the way.

442
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,320
如果你真想知道
他往那条路去了
If you'd really
like to know,

443
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:23,555
谁？
那只白兔
he went that way.

444
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,870
真的吗？
真的什么？
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.

445
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:27,638
往那条路去了
谁呀？
- He did?
- He did what?

446
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:30,029
那只白兔
什么白兔？
- Went that way.
- Who did?

447
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:33,556
不是你刚才说…
我是说…哦 亲爱的
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?

448
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:37,591
你能倒立吗？
But didn't you just say--
I mean-- Oh, dear.
Can you stand
on your head?

449
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:44,077
不管怎么样 如果我想
找到那只白兔
- Oh!
- However,

450
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:48,119
我应该问一问疯帽子
疯帽子？
if I were looking
for a white rabbit,
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

451
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,996
“疯帽子”
The Mad Hatter? Um,
no, no, I-I don't think--

452
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,433
不 我不想

453
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,958
或者那边儿的三月兔
在那个方向
Or there's the March Hare...

454
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,873
谢谢你 那我就去找他吧
in that direction.

455
00:40:57,222 --> 00:41:02,157
不过他也是个疯子
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.

456
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:04,959
可我不想找疯子
Of course,
he's mad too.

457
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:07,759
那是没办法的事
Oh, but I don't want
to go among mad people.

458
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:11,143
这儿差不多所有人都是疯子
Oh, you can't help that.
Most everyone's mad here.

459
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,396
你也许注意到了
You may have noticed...

460
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,689
我也不是很正常
that I'm not
all there myself.

461
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,983
绿毛猪回家迷路气得闹哄哄
And the mome raths
outgrabe

462
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,776
天哪
如果这儿的人都是这样
Goodness. If the people
here are like that, I--

463
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,943
那我最好还是别惹他们
I must try
not to upset them.

464
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,987
太稀奇了
How very curious.

465
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,351
如果没有人反对
那我们就一致通过了
If there are no objections
let it be unanimous

466
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,238
祝我们非生日决乐
祝我们非生日决乐
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday

467
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,364
祝我们大家非生日决乐
A very merry
unbirthday to us

468
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,915
祝我非生日决乐
祝谁？

A very merry
unbirthday to me

with another cup of tea
A very merry unbirthday
To
You

470
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,392
没地方了 没地方了

471
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,436
没有空位置 没地方了
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.

472
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,509
没地方了！
没地方了！
-No room, no room, no room!
-But I thought there was plenty of room.

473
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,318
可我觉得有很多空位置

474
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,756
可是没被邀请就坐下
太没礼貌了
Ah, but it's very rude to
sit down without being invited.

475
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,466
我觉得这是不礼貌
非常非常不礼貌
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.

476
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,300
非常非常不礼貌
Very, very,
very rude indeed.

477
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,551
真对不起
不过我很喜欢你们的歌声
Oh, I'm very sorry,

478
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,076
不知道你们能不能告诉我…
你喜欢我们的歌声？
but I did enjoy your singing,
and I wondered if you could tell me--

479
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:58,679
真是个好孩子
You enjoyed our singing?
Oh, what a delightful child.

480
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,055
我真的很激动
还从来没人夸过我们
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.

481
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,555
你一定得喝杯茶
对 喝杯茶
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.

482
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,723
你一定得喝杯茶
你们人真好
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.

483
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,141
抱歉 我打扰你们
生日聚会了 谢谢
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

484
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,437
生日？孩子
这不是生日聚会
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.

485
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:36,024
当然不是
这是非生日聚会
非生日？对不起
不过我没弄明白
这还不简单
三十天有九月…不对
非生日是…
如果你有生日 那么你…
My dear child, this is not
a birthday party.
Of course not.
This is an unbirthday party.
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept--
No. Well. An unbirthday--
If you have a birthday,
then, you--

486
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,067
她不知道非生日是什么
- She doesn't know
what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!

487
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,485
太蠢了 不过…
Well, I--

488
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,861
我来解释
I shall elucidate.

489
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,906
根据统计显示
你有一个生日
Now statistics prove
prove that you've one birthday

490
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,449
一年不就一个生日吗？
Imagine.:just one
birthday every year

491
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,318
可是非生日却有364天
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

492
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,077
所以我们才聚在这里庆祝
Precisely why we're
gathered here to cheer

493
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,786
那今天也是我的非生日
Why, then, today is
my unbirthday too.

494
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,245
是吗？
这真是太巧了
- It is?
- What a small world this is.

495
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,871
既然如此…
In that case--

496
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,289
祝你非生日决乐
祝我？
祝你

499
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,458
把蜡烛吹灭
祝你的愿望成真
Now blow the candle out, my dear
and make your wish come true

500
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,753
祝你非生日决乐
A very merry unbirthday
To you

501
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,796
一闪一闪小蝙蝠
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat,

502
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,464
真想知道你是什么
How I wonder
what you're at.

503
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,465
高高的天上任你飞
Up above the world
you fly...

504
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,174
就像个茶盘在天上
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

505
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,175
真好听
好了 亲爱的
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear,

you would like to seek--

507
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:07,517
你说你想找什么吧？
Pardon me.

508
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:09,676
哦 是的 我在找一只…
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some
information of some kind?

509
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:16,472

511

你想再来点儿茶吗？
Would you like
a little more tea?

512
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,601
我还没喝呢
所以我不用再来了
Well, I haven't had any yet,
so I can't very well take more.

513
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,643
你是说太少了你不能喝
Ah, you mean you can't
very well take less.

514
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,353
是的 剩下一点儿也能喝
Yes. You can always
take more than nothing.

515
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,104
我并不是这个意思…
亲爱的…
- But I only meant that--
- And now, my dear,

516
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,772
好像有什么东西在困扰着你
something, uh, seems
to be troubling you.

517
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,915
能不能告诉我们
从头儿说起
Uh, won't you tell us
all about it?

518
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:45,357
是的

等你说的最后就停 明白吗？
And when you come
to the end,

520
00:45:48,234 --> 00:46:01,446
开始时我和黛娜
一起坐在河边
很有意思
谁是黛娜？
黛娜是我的猫
stop, see?
Well, it all started...
while I was sitting on
the riverbank with Dinah.
Very interesting.
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see--

521
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,151
猫？

522
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:26,537
快拿果酱来 涂在他鼻子上
涂在他鼻子上

都是你惹的麻烦？

如果你没想
- Get the jam. On his nose.
Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.
My goodness. Those are
the things that upset me.
See all the trouble
you've started?
- But really, I didn't think that--
- Ah, but that's the point.

523
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,430
就别说话
换杯子 换杯子
- If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.

524
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,998
往下移动 往下移动！
可我还没用…

Oh, yes. I was sitting
on the riverbank with, uh,
with you-know-who.
I do?
I mean my c-a-t.
Tea?
Just half a cup,
if you don't mind.

528
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,757
别客气了
你想喝茶吗？
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?

529
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,300
当然 我非常喜欢 可是…
Why, yes, I'm very
fond of tea, but--

530
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,176
如果你不爱喝茶
至少可以好好聊聊
If you don't care for tea, you could
at least make polite conversation.

531
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,951
我一直想问你
我有个好主意
Well, I've been trying
to ask you--

532
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:14,053
我们换个话题
I have an excellent idea.
Let's change the subject.

533
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,054
为什么乌鸦长得像书桌？
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

534
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,836
谜语吗？让我想想
Riddles?

535
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:26,673
为什么乌鸦长得像书桌？
Let me see now.

536
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:29,672
你说什么？
为什么乌鸦长得像书桌？
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

537
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:32,593
这是什么问题？
小心
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?

538
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:36,673
她是个疯子
可那是你的愚蠢谜语
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.

539
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,727
你刚才说…
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said--

540
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,895
冷静点儿 别激动
喝杯茶怎么样？
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?

541
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,231
喝杯茶吧
抱歉 我没时间
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.

542
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,315
时间？时间？
谁有时间
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?

543
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,524
不 不 不
没时间 没时间
No, no, no, no. No time,
no time, no time.

544
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,107
再见啦 我迟到了
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.

545
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,313
那只白兔
我真的要迟到了
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.

546
00:47:56,567 --> 00:48:02,679
怪不得你迟到
你的表慢了两天
I'm so very, very late.

547
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:05,528
慢了两天？
你当然得迟到
Well, no wonder you're late. Why,
this clock is exactly two days slow.
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.

548
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,987
天哪
My goodness.

549
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,363
我们得看看这是怎么回事
We'll have to look
into this. Aha!

550
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,196
我找出毛病来了
这表里面的轮子太多了
I see what's
wrong with this.

551
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:19,795
我可怜的表
我可怜的轮子和弹簧
Why, this watch
is full of wheels.

552
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:23,195
可是…
黄油 当然
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.

553

Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.

557
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,038
这是最好的黄油
你在说什么？
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?

558
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,123

-Jam?
-Jam! I forgot all about the jam.

563
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,749
让你看看绅士是什么样子
芥末
- No! Not jam!
-Just shows you what a person'll do.

566
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,172

Lemon-- that's different.
That's-- There.

567
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,172
这样就好了
That should do it.

568
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,234
看那个
它疯了

569
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,958
哦 天哪
哦 亲爱的
- Look at that.
- It's going mad.
- Oh, my goodness.

570
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,270
它疯了
哦 天哪 我不明白
- Oh, dear.
- It's going mad. Mad watch.
- Oh, my goodness.

571
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,476
疯表 疯表！
那是最好的黄油！
- I can't understand it.
It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.

572
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,279
看 你觉得茶…
哦 天哪！
- Mad watch!
- Oh, look. Do you think the
springs-- Oh, my goodness!

573
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,803
只有一种办法
能够让疯表停下来
这茶太凉了…
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

574
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,596
它慢了两天 就是这么回事儿
Two days slow.
That's what it is.

575
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,112
我的表
是吗？
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?

576
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,113
这还是我的非生日礼物
既然如此
And it was an
unbirthday present too.

577
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,308
非生日快乐
- Well, in that case.
-A very merry unbirthday

578
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,434
祝你
To

579
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,075
兔子先生 是 兔子先生！
- You
- Mr Rabbit.

580
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,269
他又去哪儿了？
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh,
now where did he go to?

581
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:53,838
祝我们非生日决乐
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

582
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:55,831
我今天碰到这么多荒唐事
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us
- If there are no objections
let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.

583
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,274
这是我这辈子参加过的
最愚蠢的茶会
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.

584
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,984
我已经受够了
Well, I've had
enough nonsense.

585
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,610
我要回家 直接回家
I'm going home.
Straight home.

586
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:18,113
那只兔子
谁管他要去哪儿呀？
That rabbit. Who cares
where he's going anyway?

587
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:23,239
要不是因为他 我也…
“黑森林”
“黑森林？”
Why, if it hadn't
been for him, I--
''Tulgey Wood.''

588
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,782
怪了 我怎么不记得这地方
Hmm. Curious.
I don't remember this.

589
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,534
让我看看
Now let me see.

590
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,162
Oh!

591
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,629
拜托了 别再胡闹了
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.

592
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,712
如果我是从这儿来的
我应该从这儿回去
Now, if I came this way,

593
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:59,834
你说什么？
I should go back this way.
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.

594
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,426
天哪 我回家后
一定要写本关于这地方的书
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.

595
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,760
如果我能回家的话
If I-- If I ever
do get home.

596
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,990
对不起
Oh, uh, excuse me.

597
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,239
你们谁能告诉我…？
Um, could one of you
tell me--

598
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,190
算了
Uh-- Heh-heh. Never mind.

599
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,396
天哪 天越来越黑了
Oh, dear. It's getting
dreadfully dark.

600
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,230
这地方看上去从来没来过
And nothing
looks familiar.

601
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,110
我得赶快离开…
I shall certainly be glad
to get out of-- Oh!

602
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:38,741
Who. Who-who.

603
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:42,409
Who. Who-who.

604
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:47,911
如果能看到
正常，点儿的事就好了
Who.
It would be so nice if something
would make sense for a change.

605
00:52:55,414 --> 00:52:57,665
Oh!

606
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,750
“别踩着绿毛猪”
''Don't step on
the mome raths.''

607
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,833
绿毛猪？
The mome raths?

608
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,047
一条路
哦谢天谢地
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.

609
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,999
我就知道我迟早会找到一条路
Ah. I just knew I'd
find one sooner or later.

610
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,049
如果快一点儿
我说不定还能赶回家喝茶
If I hurry fast, I might even
be home in time for tea.

611
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,632
黛娜看到我难道不高兴？
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah
be happy to see me.

612
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,795
我等不及了…
Oh, I just can't wait
till I-- Ah!

613
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,933
天哪
Oh, dear. Now I--

614
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,058
现在我永远也出不去了
Now I shall never get out.

615
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,310
当一个人迷了路
Well, when--
when one's lost,

616
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,436
我想最好的主意
I-I suppose
it's good advice...

617
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,105
是呆着别动
直到有人前来发现你
to stay where you are
until someone finds you.

618
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,231
可谁会想到来这儿找我呀？
But-- But who'd ever think
to look for me here?

619
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,316
好主意
Good advice.

620
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,442
要是我先前肯听话
就不会落到这样的下场
If, If, If, If I'd listened
earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.

621
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,734
不过这就是我的问题
But-- But that's just
the trouble with me.

622
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,677
我给自己提的都是好建议
I give myself
very good advice.

623
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,154
可我从来不按着建议做
But I very seldom
follow it

624
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,076
这就是我的老毛病
That explains

625
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,118
总是让我惹麻烦
The trouble that
I'm always in

626
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,628
“耐心等待”是个好主意
Be patient

627
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:55,395
但是等待勾起了我的好奇心
Is very good advice

628
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:59,592
我就喜欢新鲜事
But the waiting
makes me curious

629
00:54:57,203 --> 00:55:05,455
如果出现了怪事情
And I'd love the change
Should something strange
Begin

630
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:12,234
我总是不顾一切地往前冲
Well, I went along
my merry way.

631
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,377
从不考虑会有什么后果
And I never stopped
to reason.

632
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,919
我早就应该知道
I should have known

633
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,512
代价迟早会付出
There'd be a price to pay

634
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,478
迟早
迟早
Someday

635
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:30,464
迟早
Someday

636
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,114
我给自己提的都是好建议
I give myself

637
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:39,800
可我从来不按着建议做
Very good advice
But I very seldom
follow it

638
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,511
我能接受教训吗？
Will I ever learn

639
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,970
去做我应该做的事？
To do the things
I should

640
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,431
我能接受教训吗？
Will I ever learn

641
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,766
去做我应该
Learn to do the things

642
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,473
做的事？
I should

643
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,562
绿毛猪回家迷路气得闹哄哄
And the mome raths
outgrabe

644
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,563
妙妙猫 是你
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!

645
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,199
你以为是谁？
那只白兔吗？
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?

646
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,239
不 我已经对兔子没兴趣了
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I-I'm through with rabbits.

647
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,775
我想回家
I wanna go home!

648
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,485
可我迷了路
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.

649
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,195
当然了 因为这儿没有你的路
That's because
you have no way.

650
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,780
你要知道
这儿只有皇后的路
All ways here, you see,
are the Queen's way.

651
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:48,152
可我没见过什么皇后呀
没有吗？
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?

652
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:53,712
可你一定会见到她
她会因为你而发疯
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!

653
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:56,430
绿毛猪回家迷路气得闹哄哄
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.

654
00:56:54,992 --> 00:57:00,069
拜托了！我怎么才能找到她？
And the mome raths
outgrabe
Please, please! Uh,
how can I find her?

655
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,109
有人走这条路
有人走那条路
Well, some go this way.

656
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:11,164
不过对我来说
我喜欢抄近路
Some go that way.
But as for me, myself,
personally,
I prefer the short cut.

657
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,753
把玫瑰涂成红色
我们把玫瑰涂成红色
Painting the roses red
We're painting
the roses red

658
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,755
不敢偷懒不敢浪费
让颜色渲染吧
We dare not stop
or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread

659
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,839
我们把玫瑰涂成红色
We're painting
the roses red
We're painting
the roses red

660
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:48,268
把玫瑰涂成红色
我们为此洒下多少泪水
Oh, painting
the roses red

661
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:49,674
因为我们知道
And many a tear we shed
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow

662
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,318
他们将停止生长

663
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,039
很快就会死亡
In fact
they'll soon be dead

664
00:57:54,594 --> 00:57:59,394
可我们还要继续
把玫瑰涂成红色
Ohh, and yet
we go ahead

665
00:57:58,096 --> 00:58:06,155
把玫瑰涂成红色
我们把玫瑰涂成红色
Painting the roses red, red
red, red, red, red, red, red
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red

666
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,074
对不起了
为什么要把玫瑰涂成红色？
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three
why must you paint them red

667
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:15,556
事情是这样的 小姑娘
Huh? Oh!
Well, the fact is, miss,

668
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,031
我们不小心种成了白玫瑰
we planted the white roses
by mistake, and--

669
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,437
可皇后喜欢红玫瑰
如果她看到玫瑰是白的
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead

670
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,437
她肯定会发火
而我们每个人
- She'd raise a fuss
-And each of us

671
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,189
就会人头落地
天哪
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!

672
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,916
既然我们都怕掉脑袋
那就得把玫瑰涂成红颜色
Since this is
the thought we dread

673
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,676
真可怜 那我来帮你们吧
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.

674
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:42,469
把玫瑰涂成红色
我们把玫瑰涂成红色
Then let me help you.
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red

675
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,314
千万别把这事儿告诉皇后
别说这话是我们说的
Don't tell the Queen
what you have seen

676
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,989
可我们把玫瑰涂成了红色
是的 把玫瑰涂成红色
Or say that's what we said but
we're painting the roses red

677
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:51,513
不是粉色
不是绿色
Yes, painting
the roses red

678
00:58:50,821 --> 00:58:56,197
不是碧绿色
我们把玫瑰涂成红色
- Not pink
- Not green
- Not aquamarine
We're painting
the roses red

679
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,390
皇后来了
皇后来了！
- The Queen!
- The Queen!

680
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,436
皇后来了
皇后来了
- Queen!
- The Queen!

681
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,636
纸牌兵 立定！
Cards, halt!

682
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,909
报数！
Sound off!

683
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,555
一，二，三，四，五，六
七，八，九，十，十一
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, jack!

684
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,391
那只兔子
The rabbit.

685
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:26,560
殿下 夫人
H-H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,

686
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,031
阁下陛下
红桃皇后
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!

687
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,314
还有国王
万岁！
- And the King.
- Hooray!

688
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:53,485
谁把我的玫瑰涂成了红色？
Hmm! Who's been
painting my roses red?

689
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,511
谁把我的玫瑰涂成了红色？
Who's been painting
my roses red?

690
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:02,314
谁胆敢用这种劣质的颜色
玷污皇家的花圃
Who dares to paint
with vulgar paint

691
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:05,198
把我的玫瑰涂成红色
The Royal flower bed
For painting my roses red

692
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,157
我要砍掉他的脑袋
Someone will lose his head

693
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,759
不要 陛下 饶命
这全是他的错儿
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!

694
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,354
不是我 陛下 是梅花A !
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!

695
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,833
你？
不是 是梅花二
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!

696
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,077
究竟是谁？
不是我 是梅花三
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!

697
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,328
够了 把他们的头统统砍掉
Off with their heads!

698
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,670
他们把玫瑰涂成了红色
因此就得人头落地
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red

699
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,832
活该 谁叫他们把红玫瑰
种成了白玫瑰
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red

700
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,514
他们都得人头落地
Oh, they're going to
lose their heads

701
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,750
安静！
Silence!

702
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,510
求求你 他们只是想…
这个人是谁？
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying--

703
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:43,919
让我看看 亲爱的
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now,
uh, uh, let me see, my dear.

704
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,031
肯定不是红桃
你以为她是梅花吗？
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?

705
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,918
她是个小姑娘
Why, it's a little girl.

706
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,922
是的 我只想…
抬起头来 好好说话
- Yes. A-And I was hoping--
- Look up. Speak nicely.

707
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,473
不要摆弄你的手指头
And don't twiddle
your fingers!

708
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,393
脚尖冲外 行屈膝礼
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.

709
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,596
嘴巴张得大一点儿
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:

710
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:08,260
时时刻刻都要说
“是的 陛下”
''Yes, Your Majesty.''

711
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,638
是的 陛下
''Yes, Your Majesty.''

712
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:18,035
你从什么地方来
要往哪里去？
Now, um, where do you come from,
and where are you going?

713
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,232
我在找我回家的路
你的路？
W-Well, I-I'm trying
to find my way home.

714
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:24,848
这儿的路统统属于我
Your way? All ways
here are my ways!

715
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,553
是的 我知道 可我想…
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking--

716
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,275
你想的时候也要行屈膝礼
这样省时间
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.

717
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,352
是的 陛下
可是我要问…
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask--

718
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,316
这儿只有我问的份儿
I'll ask the questions!

719
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,552
你会玩槌球吗？
会 陛下
Do you play croquet?

720
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:43,730
那我们就开始玩儿吧
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!

721
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,999
奉国王之命 各就各位
快点儿
To your places. To your places. By order
of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

722
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,190
洗牌！
Shuffle deck!

723
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,679

纸牌兵 立定！

726
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,595
安静！
Silence!

727
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,629
砍掉他的脑袋！
Off with his head!

728
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,269
奉国王之命 砍掉他的头
你听到她说的话了
Off with his head. Off with
his head. By order of the King.
Uh, you heard what she said.

729
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,476
下一个是你
可是…
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but--

730
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,895
我亲爱的
是的 陛下
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

731
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:14,279
Oh!

732
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,117
别闹了
全都是酒囊饭袋…
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible--

733
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:25,950
你想让我们两个都掉脑袋？
我可不想
Do you want us both
to lose our heads?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.

734
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,799
我说 你的情况怎么样？
Uh, I say, how are
you getting on?

735
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,155
一点儿都不好
你说什么？
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?

736
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,671
我说一点儿都不好
你在跟谁说话？
I said, not at all!
Who are you talking to?

737
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,871
一只猫 陛下
猫？在哪儿？
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?

738
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,949
在那儿
There. Oh.

739
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,232
他又出现了
我警告你 孩子
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child,

740
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,318
如果你惹我发火
你就得掉脑袋
if I lose my temper,
you lose your head!

741
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,958
明白了？
Understand?

742
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,115
我们可以把她气死
You know, we could make her
really angry. Shall we try?

743
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,054
要不要试试？
不要
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.

744
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,672
不过这很有意思
不 不 不 别！
No, no, no! Stop!

745
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,473
哦 不！
Oh, no!

746
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,559
哦 老天爷
Oh, my fur and whiskers!

747
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,709
天哪 快去救皇后
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.

748
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,792
不知又要砍谁的脑袋
Someone's head
will roll for this!

749
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,874
你的
Yours!

750
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,077
把她推出去…
你再考虑考虑 亲爱的
- Off with her--
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.

751
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,948
能不能先让她接受审判？
Uh, couldn't she have
a trial? Huh? First?

752
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:01,238
审判？
一个小小的审判？
- Trial?
-Well, th--Just a, a little trial? Hmm?

753
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:09,356
好吧 那审判就开始吧！
Hmm. Very well, then.
Let the trial begin!

754
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,270
陛下 陪审团成员…
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.

755
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,157
…忠诚的臣民…
Loyal subjects.

756
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,073
…还有国王
And the King.

757
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,157
犯人被控不怀好意
引诱陛下
The prisoner at the bar is
charged with enticing Her
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts,

758
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,033
红桃皇后
进行一场槌球比赛
into a game of croquet
and thereby willfully...

759
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:38,034
并且图谋不轨
-But--
-and with malice aforethought,
teasing, tormenting...

760
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,993
取笑 折磨 惹恼…
- and otherwise annoying our beloved--
- Never mind all that!

761
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,156
少废话 直接说
我是怎么发的脾气
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.

762
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,554
“…因此惹得皇后大发雷霆”
Thereby causing the Queen
to lose her temper.

763
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:52,714
你准备接受判刑了吗？
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?

764
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,917
判刑？
但必须得经过裁决
Sentence? Oh, but there
must be a verdict first.

765
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,072
先判刑 后裁决
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.

766
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,277
可审判不是这样的…
所有的路都是…
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are--

767
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:07,639
您的路 陛下
是的 我的孩子
Your ways, Your Majesty.

768
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:09,915
把她推出去…
先考虑考虑 亲爱的
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her--

769
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,993
我们没有传唤证人
能不能听听一两人的证词？
- But consider, my dear.
Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?

770
01:08:11,544 --> 01:08:17,038
能不能？
好吧
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe
one or two? Huh? Maybe?

771
01:08:14,879 --> 01:08:19,089
继续吧！
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!

01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,352
关于这件不幸的案子
你知道多少？
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know
about this, uh, unfortunate affair?

775
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,635
一无所知
我什么都不知道？
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?

776
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,998
什么都不知道
这很重要！
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!

777
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,593
陪审团 写下来
Jury, write that down.

778
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,557
“一字不落”

779
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,551
“没有事情
重要”

780
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,114
陛下的意思当然是不重要
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.

781
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,430
安静！
Silence! Next witness.

784
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,274
这件事情你是什么看法？
What have you to
say about this?

785
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,751
一闪一闪小蝙蝠
真想知道…
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder--

786
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,879
这是到目前为止我们
听到的最重要的证词
That's the most important piece
of evidence we've heard yet.

787
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,349

哦 天哪

你在哪儿？
And, uh, where were you when
this horrible crime was committed?

792
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,150
我正在家里喝茶

I was home drinking tea.
Today, you know,

必须赶快离开法庭”
must leave the court
immediately.''

818
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,272
我没有一英里高
我不离开
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.

819
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,714
抱歉 这是第42条规定的
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

820
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,078
至于你 陛下
And as for you,
Your Majesty--

821
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,199
你根本不是皇后
Your Majesty indeed.

822
01:11:21,523 --> 01:11:28,559
你只不过是一个肥胖
自大 脾气暴躁的老…
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a,

823
01:11:24,191 --> 01:11:29,675
…暴君
a fat, pompous, bad-tempered,
old ty-- tyrant.

824
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,635
你刚才说什么 亲爱的？
And, uh, what were you
saying, my dear?

825
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,111
她刚才说你是一个肥胖
自大 脾气暴躁的老暴君
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.

826
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,714
砍掉她的脑袋！
Off with her head!

827
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,657
你们听到陛下说的话了吗
砍掉她的脑袋
You heard what
Her Majesty said.
Off with her head.

828
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,112
前进 后退 向内 向外
我们再来一遍
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again

829
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,674
没有人总是输
也没有人总是赢
No one ever loses and
no one can ever win

830
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:29,544
前进 后退 向内 向外
从脚到头
砍掉他的人头！
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top
- Never let the--
- Off with her head!
Off with her head!

831
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,555
等一下
Just a moment! You can't
leave a tea party without
having a cup of tea, you know.

832
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,234
你来参加茶会
可不能连一杯茶都不喝

833
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,515
可我不能停下来
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.

834
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,964
可我们坚持
你得陪我们喝一杯
You must join us
in a cup of tea.

835
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,280
砍掉她的人头！
Off with her head!

836
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,469
毛毛虫先生 我该怎么办？
Mr Caterpillar,
what will I do?

837
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,636
你是谁？
Who are you?

838
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,589
她往那儿去了
别让她跑了！
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!

839
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,750
砍了她的脑袋！
Off with her head!

840
01:13:03,389 --> 01:13:06,918
门还锁着呢
Oh! Still locked, you know.

841
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,878
可是皇后 我必须得出去
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!

842
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,554
可你已经出去了呀
什么？
- But you are outside.
- What?

843
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,029
你自己看
See for yourself.

844
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:18,470
怎么 那是我 我在睡觉
Why-- Why, that's me!

845
01:13:16,811 --> 01:13:21,870
别让她跑了
砍掉她的脑袋
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!

846
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:24,687

- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!

847
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,433
爱丽丝！
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!

认真背书？
小鳄鱼是怎样擦亮他的尾巴
Will you kindly pay attention
and recite your lesson?
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little
crocodile improve his shining tail?

852
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:51,079
把尼罗河水…
爱丽丝 你在胡说什么？
抱歉 这是毛毛虫说的
- And pour the waters of the--

Oh. I'm sorry. But you see,
the caterpillar said--

853
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,914
毛毛虫？
哦 看在上帝的份上
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.

854
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,433
爱丽丝 我…
Alice, I-- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.

855
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,637
来吧 到该喝茶的时间了

856
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:05,158
爱丽丝梦游仙境

858

我想知道在哪里
I wonder where

859

如何才能前往仙境？
How do you get
to Wonderland

862

翻过山头 穿过地心
Over the hill
Or under land

863
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,556
或者穿过树林？
Orjust behind the tree

864
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:52,953
爱丽丝梦游仙境

前往仙境之路在何方？
