Mr. Caterpillar. What will I do?

01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,642
Who are you?

There she goes. Don't let her get away.

Oh...

1053
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,888
- Still locked, you know.
- But the queen. I simply must get out.

1054
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,531
- But you are outside.
- What?

1055
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,001
See for yourself.

1056
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,482
Why, that's me. I'm asleep.

Don't let her get away!

Please wake up, Alice.

Alice, will you kindly pay attention
and recite your lesson?

1062
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,884
Hm?

1063

Oh! How doth the little crocodile
improve his shining tail
