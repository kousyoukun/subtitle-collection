1
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:21,965
Alice in Wonderland

2
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:26,522
How do you get to Wonderland

3
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:30,600
Over the hill or under land

4
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,679
Orjust behind the tree

5
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:38,926
When clouds go rolling by

6
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,920
They roll away and leave the sky

7
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,716
Where is the land beyond the eye

8
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:50,197
That people cannot see

9
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,206
Where can it be

10
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:58,922
Where do stars go

11
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:02,477
Where is the grass that blooms

12
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:06,526
They must be somewhere

13
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:10,919
Where is the sunny afternoon

14
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:17,323
Alice in Wonderland

15
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:22,162
Where is the path to Wonderland

16
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:29,801
Over the hill or here or there

17
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:35,325
I wonder

18
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:37,318
Where

19
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:55,525
''...for if he does
and had been of late...

20
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:59,680
''much accustomed to
usurpation and conquest.

21
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:03,646
''Edwin and Morcar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria,

22
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,606
declared for him,
and even Stigand--''

23
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:10,485
- Alice.
- Hmm?

24
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,365
- Oh, I'm listening.
- ''And even Stigand,

25
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:17,156
''the Archbishop of Canterbury,
agreed to meet with William...

26
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:19,078
and offer him the Crown.''

27
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,641
''William's conduct
at first was model--''

28
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:27,198
Alice. Will you kindly
pay attention to your history lesson?

29
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm sorry, but how can one
possibly pay attention...

30
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,038
to a book with
no pictures in it?

31
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,958
My dear child,

32
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:37,881
there are a great many good books
in this world without pictures.

33
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,403
In this world, perhaps,
but in my world,

34
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,876
the books would be
nothing but pictures.

35
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,606
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.

36
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:49,076
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?

37
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,646
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.

38
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:55,082
If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

39
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,237
Nothing would be
what it is,

40
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,557
because everything would be
what it isn't,

41
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,401
and contrariwise,
what it is, it wouldn't be.

42
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,955
And what it wouldn't be,
it would.

43
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:08,607
You see?

44
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,838
In my world, you
wouldn't say ''meow.''

45
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:15,363
You'd say,
''Yes, Miss Alice.''

46
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:18,439
Oh, but you would. You'd be
just like people, Dinah.

47
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,802
And all the other
animals too.

48
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,718
Why, in my world:

49
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,877
Cats and rabbits

50
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:29,006
Would reside in
fancy little houses

51
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:33,285
And be dressed in shoes
and hats and trousers

52
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:39,278
In a world
of my own

53
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,437
All the flowers

54
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:45,600
Would have very
extra-special powers

55
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,803
They would sit
and talk to me

56
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:51,277
For hours,
when I'm lonely

57
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:55,883
In a world
of my own

58
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:57,958
There'd be new birds

59
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:02,086
Lots of nice and friendly
how-de-do birds

60
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:07,082
Everyone would have
a dozen bluebirds

61
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,965
Within that world

62
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:12,356
Of my own

63
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,483
I could listen

64
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,876
To a babbling brook

65
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:22,644
And hear a song that
I could understand

66
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:25,639
I keep wishing

67
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,037
It could be that way

68
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:32,005
Because my world would be

69
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:36,603
A wonderland.

70
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:52,157
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit
with a waistcoat-- and a watch!

71
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,636
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

72
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:59,084
Now this is curious. What could
a rabbit possibly be late for?

73
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,601
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late

74
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:04,406
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye

75
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,718
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,482
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!

77
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,286
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue

78
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,758
I'm really in a stew
No time to say goodbye, Hello
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late

79
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:22,522
My. What a peculiar place
to have a party.

80
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,886
You know, Dinah,
we really shouldn't...

81
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,798
um-- be doing this.

82
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:34,245
After all,
we haven't been invited,

83
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,121
and curiosity often
leads to trouble.

84
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,084
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

85
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:46,476
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!

86
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:52,236
Oh.

87
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,558
Well, after this, I shall
think nothing of fall--

88
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,797
Oh. Of falling down stairs.

89
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,998
Oh!

90
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,478
Ahh.

91
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:33,557
Whoa!

92
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:36,684
Goodness. What if I
should fall right through...

93
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,201
the centre of the earth--

94
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,120
Oh! And come out
the other side...

95
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,323
where people walk
upside down?

96
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:48,161
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody-- Oh!

97
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,367
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!

98
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:58,405
Please!

99
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,760
Curiouser and curiouser!

100
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:22,726
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.

101
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:26,686
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.

102
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,282
- You see, I was following--
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?

103
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,756
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?

104
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:36,840
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?

105
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:40,397
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit,
so, um, if you don't mind--

106
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,284
Eh? Oh!

107
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:46,519
- There he is! I simply
must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.

108
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,677
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.

109
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,679
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.

110
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:56,964
- Why don't you try
the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!

111
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:01,165
Read the directions and directly you'll
be directed in the right direction.

112
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,158
''Drink me.''

113
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:07,206
Hmm. Better look first,
for if one drinks much...

114
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,482
from a bottle
marked ''poison,''

115
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:13,640
it's almost certain to disagree
with one sooner or later.

116
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,402
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself
some good advice.

117
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:20,365
But-- Mmm.

118
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:22,915
Tastes like, uh,
cherry tart.

119
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:28,035
Custard, pineapple,
roast turkey. Goodness!

120
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:31,443
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

121
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:33,882
You almost went out
like a candle.

122
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,845
But look!
I'm just the right size.

123
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,997
Oh, no use.

124
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,998
I forgot to tell you.

125
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,918
I'm locked!

126
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,202
Oh, no!

127
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,881
Uh, but of course, uh,
you've got the key, so--

128
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,721
- What key?
- Now don't tell me
you've left it up there.

129
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,598
Oh, dear.

130
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:04,765
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.

131
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,917
Oh!

132
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:10,761
''Eat me.'' All right,
but goodness knows what this will do.

133
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,203
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, oh!

134
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,243
What did you say?

135
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,319
I said, ''A little of that
went a long way.''

136
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,562
Well, I don't think
it's so funny.

137
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,559
Now-- Now I shall
n-never get home!

138
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:31,083
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.

139
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,362
I know, but I-I--

140
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,802
I just can't--
I can't stop!

141
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:39,004
Come! Oh! Say,
this won't do.

142
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:46,757
It won't do at all.

143
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,236
You! You up there!
Stop!

144
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,158
I say! Oh, look!

145
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,715
The bottle. The bottle!

146
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,404
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.

147
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,004
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

148
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,362
How I love to sail
on the bounding sea

149
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,438
And I never, never, ever
do a thing about the weather

150
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,961
For the weather never, ever
does a thing for me

151
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:27,323
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

152
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,637
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee

153
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,718
And I never, ev--
Ahoy!

154
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,595
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!

155
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,723
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?

156
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,605
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.

157
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,360
Have you in port
in no time at all.

158
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:46,757
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!

159
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,759
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!

160
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,441
Um, uh, uh, pardon me,
but, uh,

161
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:59,202
would you mind
helping me, please?

162
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,040
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

163
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:05,085
Help me. Please!
Won't you--

164
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,562
Help me!

165
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:14,605
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

166
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,520
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

167
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:20,519
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

168
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,758
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop

169
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:26,680
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay

170
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,565
That's all they did tomorrow
but you finished yesterday

171
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,923
Round and round and round
we go until forevermore

172
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,805
Once we were behind
but now we find we are be--

173
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:38,845
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

174
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,885
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

175
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,482
Ah, backward--
I say! You'll never get dry that way.

176
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,127
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.

177
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,323
First rule of
a caucus race, you know.

178
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:53,205
But how can I--

179
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:56,404
That's better. Have you
dry in no time now.

180
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,842
No one can ever
get dry this way.

181
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,397
Nonsense! Why, I'm
as dry as a bone already.

182
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,365
- Yes, but--
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.

183
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:08,325
Look lively.

184
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:12,161
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit--

185
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,761
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.

186
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,678
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.

187
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,201
- I'm late, I'm late.
- Don't step on the fish!
Uh, w-w-watch it there.

188
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:22,279
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well--

189
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:27,720
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.

190
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:31,356
Oh, dear, I'm sure
he came this way.

191
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:33,642
Do you suppose
he could be hiding?

192
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,877
Hmm.

193
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,435
Not here.

194
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,358
I wonder.

195
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,278
No, I suppose
he must've--

196
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:56,155
Oh! Why, what peculiar
little figures.

197
00:12:57,487 --> 00:13:01,082
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

198
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,965
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

199
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:07,357
Contrary to wax, if you think
we're alive, you ought to speak to us.

200
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:17,721
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.

201
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,638
Goodbye.

202
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,558
You're beginning backwards.

203
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:24,036
Aye, the first thing
in a visit is to say:

204
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,244
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands

205
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:31,240
How do you do and shake hands
and state your name and business

206
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,125
- That's manners.
- Really?

207
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:37,165
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm
following a white rabbit, so--

208
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:40,762
-No, you can't go yet.
-No, the visit has just started.

209
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:44,556
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?

210
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:47,400
- Or ''Button, button,
who's got the button''?
- No, thank you.

211
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,955
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

212
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:54,756
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

213
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,361
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

214
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,996
- Why?
- Well, I-I'm curious to know
where he's going.

215
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,237
Oh, she's curious.

216
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:07,366
The oysters were curious,
too, weren't they?

217
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,245
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

218
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,162
- Poor things.
- Poor things.

219
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,522
Why? What did happen
to the oysters?

220
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,075
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.

221
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,965
No, no, you're in
much too much of a hurry.

222
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,278
- Well, perhaps I could
spare a little time.
- You could?

223
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,766
Well!

224
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,441
''The Walrus
and the Carpenter.''

225
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:34,122
Or ''The Story of
the Curious Oysters.''

226
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,522
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might

227
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:46,725
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright

228
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:49,480
And this was odd
because it was

229
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,797
The middle of the night

230
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,404
The walrus
and the carpenter

231
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:03,523
Were walking close at hand

232
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:05,438
The beach was wide
from side to side

233
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,438
But much too full of sand

234
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,802
Mr Walrus
said the carpenter

235
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,843
My brain begins to perk

236
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,157
We'll sweep this clear
in half a year

237
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,078
If you don't mind the work

238
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,635
Work!

239
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:21,195
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said

240
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,041
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax

241
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,958
And cabbages and kings

242
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:31,120
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

243
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:34,597
Calloo, callay
No work today

244
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:37,838
We're cabbages and kings

245
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:11,404
Oh, uh, oysters, come out
and walk with us.

246
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,796
The day is warm and bright.

247
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,276
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk,

248
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,801
would be a sheer delight.

249
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,640
Yes, and should we
get hungry on the way,

250
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:24,002
we'll stop and, uh,
have a bite.

251
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,561
But Mother Oyster
winked her eye

252
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,797
And shook her heavy head

253
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:34,447
She knew too well
this was no time

254
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,087
To leave her oyster bed

255
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,204
The sea is nice
Take my advice

256
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:43,165
-And stay right here
- Mum said

257
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,478
Yes, yes, of course, of course,
but, uh, ha-ha!

258
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,398
The time has come
my little friends

259
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,762
To talk of other things

260
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:54,601
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings

261
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:59,078
And why the sea is boiling hot
and, uh, whether pigs have wings

262
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:03,325
Calloo, callay
Come run away

263
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:06,126
With cabbages and kings

264
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:47,318
Well, now, uh,
let me see.

265
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,960
Ah! A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.

266
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:00,240
Listen, how 'bout some pepper
and salt and vinegar, eh?

267
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:03,922
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.

268
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:07,955
Now, if you're ready,

269
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:09,878
oysters, dear,

270
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,681
we can begin the feed.

271
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:16,361
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh--

272
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,883
The time has come my little friends
to talk of food and things

273
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,323
Of peppercorns and mustard seed
and other seasonings

274
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:26,558
We'll mix 'em all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings

275
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,366
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today

276
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:33,998
Like cabbages and kings

277
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:40,125
I, uh-- I-I weep for you.

278
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:44,439
I-- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.

279
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:46,757
For I've enjoyed
your company...

280
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:50,317
oh, much more
than you realize.

281
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,319
Little oysters.
Little oysters.

282
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,126
But answer there came none

283
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:59,119
And this was scarcely
odd because

284
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:02,802
They'd been eaten, every one

285
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,966
Well, uh--

286
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,598
The time has come!

287
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,602
With cabbages

288
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:25,123
And kings

289
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,040
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.

290
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,322
Aye, and there's
a moral to it.

291
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:33,524
Oh, yes, a very good moral,
if you happen to be an oyster.

292
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,519
- Well, it's been a very nice visit--
- Another recitation.

293
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,563
- I'm sorry, but--
- Entitled ''Father William.''

294
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,478
- But really, I'm--
- First verse.

295
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,922
You are old, Father William
the young man said

296
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,123
And your hair
has become very white

297
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,163
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head

298
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,238
Do you think at your age
it is right, it's right

299
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:51,522
Do you think at your age
it is right

300
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,646
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son

301
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,718
I'd do it again
and again and again

302
00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,957
And I've done it again
and again and again

303
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,003
I wonder who lives here.

304
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:12,076
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?

305
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,078
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!

306
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,727
Mary Ann!

307
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:19,605
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.

308
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,882
Excuse me, sir, but--
but I've been trying to--

309
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,322
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?

310
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:27,524
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something.
Stand there. No, no! Go, go!

311
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:30,121
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?

312
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:32,767
- That's just what I--
- My gloves!

313
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,997
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.

314
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:38,284
I suppose I'll be taking
orders from Dinah next.

315
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,676
Hmm. Now let me see.

316
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:46,126
If I were a rabbit, where
would I keep my gloves?

317
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,357
Oh! Thank you.

318
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,915
Don't mind if I do.

319
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,478
Oh, no, no, not again.

320
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:01,163
Oh! Mary Ann!

321
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:07,402
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!

322
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,482
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!

323
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,842
No! Help!

324
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,885
Monster! Help! Assistance!

325
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,001
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!

326
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:30,284
- In my house, Dodo. Oh,
my poor little-bitty house.
- The dodo.

327
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,165
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't
be as bad as all that, you know.

328
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:37,684
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and-- There it is!

329
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,237
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?

330
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,363
Well, do something, Doo-doo.

331
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:46,359
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary
situation, but, uh--

332
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,519
But, but, but, but, but what?

333
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,075
But I have a very
simple solution.

334
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,761
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?

335
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,998
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.

336
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:00,806
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.

337
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,957
What we need is a-- Uh--

338
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:08,682
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!

339
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:12,601
Bill! We need a lazard with
a lidder-- A lidder-- A b-b-b---

340
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,121
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.

341
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:17,880
Bill, me lad, have you
ever been down a chimney?

342
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,527
Why, governor, I've been
down more chimneys--

343
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:24,122
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney...

344
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,084
and haul that monster
out of there.

345
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,476
Righto, governor.
Monster?

346
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,075
Steady now. There.
That's better.

347
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,842
Bill, lad, you're passing up
a golden opportunity.

348
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:44,997
- I am?
- You can be famous.

349
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,123
- I can?
- Of course!

350
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:50,005
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.

351
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,601
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail...

352
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,599
around the monster's neck
and drag it out.

353
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:58,804
- B-But-But, governor--
- Good luck, Bill.

354
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:14,283
Well, there goes Bill.

355
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:17,682
- Poor Bill.
- Uh,

356
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:21,476
perhaps we should try
a-a more energetic remedy.

357
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,523
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!

358
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:27,361
Oh, I-I propose
that we, uh--

359
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,519
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh--

360
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,438
Oh!

361
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,564
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.

362
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,002
Yes. Burn the house-- What?

363
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:40,203
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!

364
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:42,596
Oh, we'll smoke
the blighter out

365
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,564
We'll put the beast to rout

366
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,478
Some kindling
A stick or two

367
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:49,798
Ah, this bit of rubbish
ought to do

368
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,685
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out

369
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:56,965
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!

370
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,323
Oh, we'll roast
the blighter's toes

371
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,238
We'll toast
the bounder's nose

372
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:04,443
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear

373
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,405
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.

374
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,047
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?

375
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:14,518
Without a single doubt
we'll smoke the monster out

376
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,996
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!

377
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:18,964
My poor house
and furniture.

378
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:21,641
Oh, dear.
This is serious.

379
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,366
I simply must-- Ah!
A garden.

380
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:29,316
Perhaps if I ate something,
it would make me grow smaller.

381
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,363
Let go! Help!

382
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:35,076
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you--

383
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:38,716
You barbarian!
Help!

384
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,281
Monster!

385
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:44,358
Help!

386
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:47,519
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.

387
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,962
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?

388
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:53,198
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

389
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:55,847
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.

390
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,566
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but--

391
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:01,957
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.

392
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,197
Well, can't have
monsters about.

393
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,482
Jolly well have to
carry on alone.

394
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,285
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!

395
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:19,159
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

396
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:22,444
Why, what curious
butterflies.

397
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:24,643
You mean
bread-and-butterflies.

398
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:26,638
Oh, yes,
of course, uh-- Hmm?

399
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:30,118
Now who do you suppose--

400
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:39,400
A horsefly! I mean,
a-a rocking horsefly.

401
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,320
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon,

402
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,523
but, uh, did you--

403
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:48,236
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

404
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,522
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

405
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,882
If there's anyone
worth talking to.

406
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,958
Or about.

407
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,163
- And we sing too.
- You do?

408
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,886
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
''Tell It to the Tulips''?

409
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:03,482
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about
the shy little violets.

410
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,764
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do ''Lovely Lily of the Valley.''

411
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:09,156
- How 'bout a daisy duet?
- Oh, she wouldn't like that.
- Oh, watch the rose.

412
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:13,923
Girls! We shall sing
''Golden Afternoon.''

413
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,475
That's about all of us.

414
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:18,683
Sound your ''A,'' Lily.

415
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:21,042
La

416
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:22,799
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi

417
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:24,400
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

418
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:26,159
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

419
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:27,999
Dum du dum-dum

420
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:39,720
Little bread-and-butterflies
kiss the tulips

421
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,516
And the sun is like
a toy balloon

422
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,395
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories

423
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:51,400
In the golden afternoon

424
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:55,196
There are dizzy daffodils
on the hillside

425
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:59,075
Strings of violets
are all in tune

426
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:03,160
Tiger lilies
love the dandelions

427
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,841
In the golden afternoon

428
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:08,760
The gold afternoon

429
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,883
There are
dog- and cat-erpillars

430
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,878
And a copper centipede

431
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,481
Where the lazy daisies

432
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,035
Love the very

433
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:21,597
Peaceful life

434
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:27,125
They lead

435
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:30,961
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

436
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:33,880
For especially
in the month ofJune

437
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,798
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth

438
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:39,721
Of happiness
and romance

439
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:43,197
All in the golden

440
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,755
Afternoon

441
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:07,882
All in the golden afternoon

442
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:13,963
The golden afternoon

443
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:19,440
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

444
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:24,647
For especially
in the month ofJune

445
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:26,957
There's a wealth
of happiness

446
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:30,198
And romance

447
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:32,596
All--

448
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:37,283
The golden afternoon

449
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:46,126
Ah

450
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,327
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.

451
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:56,001
What kind of garden
do you come from?

452
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,600
Oh, I don't come
from any garden.

453
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,837
Do you suppose
she's a wild flower?

454
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:02,805
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.

455
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:06,675
Just what specie-- or shall we
say genus-- are you, my dear?

456
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,598
Well, I suppose
you'd call me...

457
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,838
a Genus Humanus Alice.

458
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:14,236
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?

459
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,841
Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?

460
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:21,159
Yes. And did you
notice her petals?

461
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:23,522
What a peculiar colour.

462
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,916
And no fragrance.

463
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,963
Just look at those stems.

464
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:29,878
Rather scrawny, I'd say.

465
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:31,719
I think she's pretty.

466
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:34,037
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.

467
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:36,436
Aha!Just as I suspected.

468
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:40,645
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.

469
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:42,683
Oh, no!

470
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,327
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:

471
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:48,399
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.

472
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,763
- Well, you wouldn't
expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?

473
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,805
-Well, goodness!
-Don't let her stay here and go to seed.

474
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:57,242
- Go on now. Don't you take root--
- Please, girls!

475
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,795
We don't want weeds
in our bed.

476
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:02,355
Move along, move along.

477
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:10,165
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.

478
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:14,206
If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.

479
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:16,596
And I guess
that would teach you.

480
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,599
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers.

481
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:29,236
Hm! Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.

482
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:36,121
A

483
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:39,643
E-I-O-U

484
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:44,197
A-E-I-O-U

485
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:48,677
A-E-I-O-U

486
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,835
Who

487
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:58,239
U-E-I-O-A

488
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:03,321
U-E-I-A

489
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:08,800
A-E-I-O-U

490
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:20,325
Who are you?

491
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:23,080
Well, I-I-I
hardly know, sir.

492
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,920
I've changed so many times
since this morning, you see--

493
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:28,475
I do not see.

494
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,205
Explain yourself.

495
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,881
I'm afraid I can't
explain myself, sir,

496
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:35,276
because I'm not myself,
you know.

497
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,198
I do not know.

498
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:41,246
Well, I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.

499
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:45,286
You? Who are you?

500
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,006
Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...

501
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:53,843
who you are first?

502
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:56,646
Why?

503
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,764
Oh, dear, everything
is so confusing.

504
00:31:59,847 --> 00:32:02,486
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.

505
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:06,401
- Why?
- Well, I can't remember
things as I used to, and--

506
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:09,001
- Recite.
- Hmm?

507
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:12,397
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um--

508
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:15,365
How doth the little
busy bee improve each shin--

509
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:18,007
Stop.

510
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,078
That is not spoken
correct-ically.

511
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,998
It goes:

512
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:25,758
How--

513
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,642
How doth
the little crocodile...

514
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:39,036
improve his shining tail...

515
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:41,197
and pour the waters
of the Nile...

516
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:44,165
on every golden scale?

517
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:47,357
How cheer--

518
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:50,564
How cheer--

519
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,635
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

520
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,797
How neatly
spreads his claws...

521
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:04,316
and welcomes
little fishes in...

522
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:08,480
with gently smiling jaws.

523
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,206
Well, I must say I've never
heard it that way before.

524
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:14,085
I know.
I have improved it.

525
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:17,557
Well-- If you ask me--

526
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,717
You? Heh!

527
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:22,196
Who are you?

528
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:31,118
Oh!

529
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:41,285
Uh, you there. Girl!

530
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,881
Wait! Come back!

531
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:46,003
I have something
important to say.

532
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:49,641
Oh, dear.

533
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,843
I wonder what
he wants now.

534
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,395
Well?

535
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:08,637
Keep your temper.

536
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,477
- Is that all?
- No.

537
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:18,321
Exact-ically what
is your problem?

538
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:21,080
Well, it's exact-ically--
exact-ical--

539
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,442
Well, it's precisely this:

540
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,836
I should like to be
a little larger, sir.

541
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:28,805
- Why?
- Well, after all,

542
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,162
three inches is such
a wretched height--

543
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:33,966
I am exact-ically
three inches high!

544
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:36,686
And it is a very good
height indeed!

545
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:42,322
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't...

546
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:44,238
shout!

547
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:50,484
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have
a few more helpful hints.

548
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,717
One side will make you
grow taller.

549
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:57,278
- One side of what?
- And the other side will
make you grow shorter.

550
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,484
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!

551
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,443
Hmm.

552
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:13,005
One side will
make me grow--

553
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:15,043
But which is which?

554
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:19,483
Hmm. After all
that's happened, I--

555
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,081
I wonder if I--
I don't care.

556
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,795
I'm tired of being
only three inches high.

557
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:30,163
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

558
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,926
A serpent! Help!

559
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,157
Help! Serpent! Serpent!

560
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:46,078
Oh, but please, please!

561
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:49,955
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!

562
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,642
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser-- Indeed?

563
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:56,958
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.

564
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,277
Little? Ha! Little?

565
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:03,959
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.

566
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:07,403
And I suppose you
don't eat eggs either.

567
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:10,877
- Yes, I do, but, but, but--
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.

568
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:14,323
Serpent. Serpent!

569
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:15,965
Oh, for goodness' sake.

570
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,880
Hmm! And the
other side will--

571
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,639
The very idea.

572
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,878
Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.

573
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:38,115
Goodness. I wonder if I'll
ever get the knack of it.

574
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:47,678
There. That's much better.

575
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,196
Hmm. Better save these.

576
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,086
Now let's see.
Where was I?

577
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:04,163
Hmm. I-- I wonder
which way I ought to go.

578
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:07,444
'Twas brillig

579
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:09,358
And the slithy toves

580
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:13,360
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

581
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:17,406
All mimsy
were the borogroves

582
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:21,844
And the mome raths
outgrabe

583
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:24,760
Now where in the world
do you suppose that--

584
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:26,997
- Lose something?
- Oh!

585
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:30,079
Oh, uh-- I--
I was-- N-No.

586
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,283
I-I-I mean, I-I was
just wondering--

587
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:35,518
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.

588
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,798
Ooh.

589
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:41,123
Second chorus.

590
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:43,681
'Twas brillig

591
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,723
And the slithy toves

592
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:50,517
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

593
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:52,962
Why-- Why, you're a cat.

594
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:56,960
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy

595
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,038
Were the borogroves

596
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:02,199
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.

597
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,403
There you are.
Third chorus.

598
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:06,364
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but--

599
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,881
But I just wanted to ask you
which way I ought to go.

600
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,527
Well, that depends...

601
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:14,599
on where you want
to get to.

602
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:16,996
Oh, it really doesn't matter,
as long as I--

603
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,999
Then it really
doesn't matter...

604
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:22,362
which way you go.

605
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:29,957
And the mome raths outgrabe

606
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,846
Oh, by the way.

607
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:37,316
If you'd really
like to know,

608
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:39,796
he went that way.

609
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,878
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.

610
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,162
- He did?
- He did what?

611
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:46,839
- Went that way.
- Who did?

612
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:49,122
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?

613
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:53,041
But didn't you just say--
I mean-- Oh, dear.

614
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:55,243
Can you stand
on your head?

615
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:58,444
- Oh!
- However,

616
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:02,566
if I were looking
for a white rabbit,

617
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:05,115
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

618
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:08,677
The Mad Hatter? Um,
no, no, I-I don't think--

619
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,804
Or there's the March Hare...

620
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:14,003
in that direction.

621
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,840
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.

622
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:19,964
Of course,
he's mad too.

623
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,641
Oh, but I don't want
to go among mad people.

624
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,287
Oh, you can't help that.

625
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,437
Most everyone's mad here.

626
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:34,400
You may have noticed...

627
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:38,526
that I'm not
all there myself.

628
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:45,522
And the mome raths
outgrabe

629
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:49,165
Goodness. If the people
here are like that, I--

630
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:51,238
I must try
not to upset them.

631
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:56,076
How very curious.

632
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:59,443
If there are no objections
let it be unanimous

633
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:03,042
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
-A very merry unbirthday

634
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:06,039
A very merry
unbirthday to us

635
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:26,723
A very merry
unbirthday to me

636
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:28,286
- To who
- To me
- Oh, you

637
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:30,005
A very merry
unbirthday to you

638
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,679
- Who, me
- Yes, you
- Oh, me

639
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:34,679
Let's all congratulate us
with another cup of tea

640
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:37,804
A very merry unbirthday

641
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:41,163
To

642
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:43,078
You

643
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,317
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.

644
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:52,116
-No room, no room, no room!
-But I thought there was plenty of room.

645
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:54,402
Ah, but it's very rude to
sit down without being invited.

646
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:58,924
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.

647
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,646
Very, very,
very rude indeed.

648
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,558
Oh, I'm very sorry,

649
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:06,241
but I did enjoy your singing,
and I wondered if you could tell me--

650
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,204
You enjoyed our singing?

651
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:10,642
Oh, what a delightful child.

652
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:14,846
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.

653
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:18,203
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.

654
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:21,245
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.

655
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:23,557
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

656
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,207
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.

657
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,676
My dear child, this is not
a birthday party.

658
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,598
Of course not.

659
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:33,956
This is an unbirthday party.

660
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:38,199
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

661
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,642
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept--

662
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:43,958
No. Well. An unbirthday--

663
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:46,481
If you have a birthday,
then, you--

664
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:51,325
- She doesn't know
what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!

665
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,603
Well, I--

666
00:41:57,487 --> 00:41:59,762
I shall elucidate.

667
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:09,402
Now statistics prove
prove that you've one birthday

668
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,842
Imagine.:just one
birthday every year

669
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:16,796
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

670
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:19,162
Precisely why we're
gathered here to cheer

671
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,761
Why, then, today is
my unbirthday too.

672
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:25,078
- It is?
- What a small world this is.

673
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,601
In that case--

674
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:30,884
-A very merry unbirthday
- To me

675
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,561
- To you
-A very merry unbirthday

676
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,558
- For me
- For you

677
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,686
Now blow the candle out, my dear
and make your wish come true

678
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:46,516
A very merry unbirthday

679
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,598
To you

680
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,438
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat,

681
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,995
How I wonder
what you're at.

682
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,885
Up above the world
you fly...

683
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:02,437
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

684
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,281
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear,

685
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,564
uh, you were saying that
you would like to seek--

686
00:43:09,647 --> 00:43:12,115
Pardon me.

687
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:15,199
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some
information of some kind?

688
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,278
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a--

689
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:20,598
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!

690
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:22,757
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up

691
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,964
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down

692
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:28,038
Would you like
a little more tea?

693
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,642
Well, I haven't had any yet,
so I can't very well take more.

694
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,560
Ah, you mean you can't
very well take less.

695
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:38,117
Yes. You can always
take more than nothing.

696
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:41,722
- But I only meant that--
- And now, my dear,

697
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:44,275
something, uh, seems
to be troubling you.

698
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:47,403
Uh, won't you tell us
all about it?

699
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:50,604
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.

700
00:43:50,687 --> 00:43:53,281
And when you come
to the end,

701
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,198
stop, see?

702
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:57,118
Well, it all started...

703
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:59,596
while I was sitting on
the riverbank with Dinah.

704
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,360
Very interesting.

705
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:06,042
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see--

706
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:08,561
Ah! Cat?

707
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:18,042
- Get the jam. On his nose.
Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.

708
00:44:18,127 --> 00:44:21,881
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.

709
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:25,880
My goodness. Those are
the things that upset me.

710
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,798
See all the trouble
you've started?

711
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:30,117
- But really, I didn't think that--
- Ah, but that's the point.

712
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:32,801
- If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.

713
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:35,355
Move down, move down, move down!

714
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,278
-But I still haven't used--
-Move down, move down, move down

715
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,244
Move down

716
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,524
And now, my dear,
as you were saying?

717
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:46,077
Oh, yes. I was sitting
on the riverbank with, uh,

718
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,998
with you-know-who.

719
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:50,043
I do?

720
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:54,166
I mean my c-a-t.

721
00:44:54,247 --> 00:44:56,283
Tea?

722
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,358
Just half a cup,
if you don't mind.

723
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,959
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?

724
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,402
Why, yes, I'm very
fond of tea, but--

725
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:09,116
If you don't care for tea, you could
at least make polite conversation.

726
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,596
Well, I've been trying
to ask you--

727
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:13,564
I have an excellent idea.

728
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,717
Let's change the subject.

729
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:20,524
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

730
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:22,802
Riddles?

731
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,718
Let me see now.

732
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:28,766
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

733
00:45:28,847 --> 00:45:32,283
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?

734
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:36,280
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.

735
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,404
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said--

736
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,445
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?

737
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:46,600
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.

738
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:49,565
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?

739
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,683
No, no, no, no. No time,
no time, no time.

740
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:54,156
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.

741
00:45:54,247 --> 00:45:56,442
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.

742
00:45:56,527 --> 00:45:58,438
I'm so very, very late.

743
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:03,157
Well, no wonder you're late. Why,
this clock is exactly two days slow.

744
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,124
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.

745
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,437
My goodness.

746
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:11,678
We'll have to look
into this. Aha!

747
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,598
I see what's
wrong with this.

748
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,121
Why, this watch
is full of wheels.

749
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:20,439
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.

750
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,836
- But, but, but, but,
but, but, but, but--
- Butter! Of course!

751
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:25,725
It needs some butter.
Butter!

752
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:28,605
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?

753
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:31,565
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.

754
00:46:31,647 --> 00:46:34,161
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.

755
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,284
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?

756
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:40,245
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought
of tea! Of course.

757
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:42,318
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.

758
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:45,240
- Sugar?
-Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y-- Two spoons.

759
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:47,921
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!

760
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:49,963
-Jam?
-Jam! I forgot all about the jam.

761
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:52,163
- No! Not jam!
-Just shows you what a person'll do.

762
00:46:52,247 --> 00:46:55,000
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus--

763
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:59,365
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.

764
00:46:59,447 --> 00:47:02,359
Lemon-- that's different.
That's-- There.

765
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,278
That should do it.

766
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:08,917
- Look at that.
- It's going mad.
- Oh, my goodness.

767
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:11,567
- Oh, dear.
- It's going mad. Mad watch.
- Oh, my goodness.

768
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:13,478
- I can't understand it.
It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.

769
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:16,684
- Mad watch!
- Oh, look. Do you think the
springs-- Oh, my goodness!

770
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,281
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

771
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:24,843
Two days slow.
That's what it is.

772
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,044
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?

773
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:30,516
And it was an
unbirthday present too.

774
00:47:30,607 --> 00:47:34,156
- Well, in that case.
-A very merry unbirthday

775
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:37,159
To

776
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:39,841
- You
- Mr Rabbit.

777
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:42,760
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh,
now where did he go to?

778
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,805
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

779
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:49,436
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

780
00:47:49,527 --> 00:47:51,563
- If there are no objections
let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.

781
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:56,198
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.

782
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:02,643
Well, I've had
enough nonsense.

783
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:06,117
I'm going home.
Straight home.

784
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:12,356
That rabbit. Who cares
where he's going anyway?

785
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:15,041
Why, if it hadn't
been for him, I--

786
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:17,277
''Tulgey Wood.''

787
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:20,677
Hmm. Curious.

788
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,598
I don't remember this.

789
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,118
Now let me see.

790
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:34,481
Oh!

791
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:39,122
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.

792
00:48:43,727 --> 00:48:47,402
Now, if I came this way,

793
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:50,445
I should go back this way.

794
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,404
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.

795
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:15,041
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.

796
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,199
If I-- If I ever
do get home.

797
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:33,485
Oh, uh, excuse me.

798
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:35,603
Um, could one of you
tell me--

799
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,197
Uh-- Heh-heh. Never mind.

800
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:53,403
Oh, dear. It's getting
dreadfully dark.

801
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:55,318
And nothing
looks familiar.

802
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,443
I shall certainly be glad
to get out of-- Oh!

803
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:27,317
Who. Who-who.

804
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:30,843
Who. Who-who.

805
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,758
Who.

806
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:36,123
It would be so nice if something
would make sense for a change.

807
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,477
Oh!

808
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:52,283
''Don't step on
the mome raths.''

809
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:55,245
The mome raths?

810
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:06,956
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.

811
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:11,165
Ah. I just knew I'd
find one sooner or later.

812
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:14,637
If I hurry fast, I might even
be home in time for tea.

813
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:17,799
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah
be happy to see me.

814
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:22,606
Oh, I just can't wait
till I-- Ah!

815
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:40,445
Oh, dear. Now I--

816
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:42,483
Now I shall never get out.

817
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:47,524
Well, when--
when one's lost,

818
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:51,486
I-I suppose
it's good advice...

819
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,958
to stay where you are
until someone finds you.

820
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:58,959
But-- But who'd ever think
to look for me here?

821
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:04,805
Good advice.

822
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:08,766
If, If, If, If I'd listened
earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.

823
00:52:08,847 --> 00:52:11,919
But-- But that's just
the trouble with me.

824
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:15,044
I give myself
very good advice.

825
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:19,997
But I very seldom
follow it

826
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:24,323
That explains

827
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,082
The trouble that
I'm always in

828
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:32,678
Be patient

829
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:35,406
Is very good advice

830
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:40,117
But the waiting
makes me curious

831
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:43,404
And I'd love the change

832
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:46,206
Should something strange

833
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:48,118
Begin

834
00:52:50,407 --> 00:52:54,116
Well, I went along
my merry way.

835
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:59,560
And I never stopped
to reason.

836
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:03,921
I should have known

837
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:06,646
There'd be a price to pay

838
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:09,241
Someday

839
00:53:09,327 --> 00:53:12,125
Someday

840
00:53:12,207 --> 00:53:15,244
I give myself

841
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:18,046
Very good advice

842
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:21,085
But I very seldom
follow it

843
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,561
Will I ever learn

844
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:29,878
To do the things

845
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,798
I should

846
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:38,003
Will I ever learn

847
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:44,085
Learn to do the things

848
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,523
I should

849
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:58,279
And the mome raths
outgrabe

850
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:00,198
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!

851
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:04,121
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?

852
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,200
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I-I'm through with rabbits.

853
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,960
I wanna go home!

854
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,561
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.

855
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:16,161
That's because
you have no way.

856
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:21,526
All ways here, you see,
are the Queen's way.

857
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:24,997
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?

858
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:29,205
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!

859
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:33,166
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.

860
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:35,078
And the mome raths
outgrabe

861
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:38,523
Please, please! Uh,
how can I find her?

862
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:41,405
Well, some go this way.

863
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,557
Some go that way.

864
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,207
But as for me, myself,
personally,

865
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:48,755
I prefer the short cut.

866
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,558
Painting the roses red

867
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:09,478
We're painting
the roses red

868
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,398
We dare not stop
or waste a drop

869
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:13,318
So let the paint be spread

870
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,080
We're painting
the roses red

871
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,203
We're painting
the roses red

872
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:22,844
Oh, painting
the roses red

873
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:24,758
And many a tear we shed

874
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:27,645
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow

875
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:30,366
In fact
they'll soon be dead

876
00:55:30,447 --> 00:55:33,723
Ohh, and yet
we go ahead

877
00:55:33,807 --> 00:55:38,323
Painting the roses red, red
red, red, red, red, red, red

878
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:41,956
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red

879
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,926
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three
why must you paint them red

880
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:48,805
Huh? Oh!

881
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,003
Well, the fact is, miss,

882
00:55:51,087 --> 00:55:55,603
we planted the white roses
by mistake, and--

883
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:59,077
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead

884
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:00,998
- She'd raise a fuss
-And each of us

885
00:56:01,087 --> 00:56:03,647
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!

886
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:07,879
Since this is
the thought we dread

887
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:11,084
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.

888
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,998
Then let me help you.

889
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:16,682
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red

890
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,598
Don't tell the Queen
what you have seen

891
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:22,043
Or say that's what we said but
we're painting the roses red

892
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:24,322
Yes, painting
the roses red

893
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:26,363
- Not pink
- Not green
- Not aquamarine

894
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:29,564
We're painting
the roses red

895
00:56:35,647 --> 00:56:37,763
- The Queen!
- The Queen!

896
00:56:37,847 --> 00:56:39,678
- Queen!
- The Queen!

897
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:38,238
Cards, halt!

898
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:40,523
Sound off!

899
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:41,723
One, two, three,

900
00:57:41,807 --> 00:57:43,638
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, jack!

901
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,398
The rabbit.

902
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:56,282
H-H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,

903
00:57:56,367 --> 00:58:01,725
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!

904
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:06,602
- And the King.
- Hooray!

905
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:22,122
Hmm! Who's been
painting my roses red?

906
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,836
Who's been painting
my roses red?

907
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:28,441
Who dares to paint
with vulgar paint

908
00:58:28,527 --> 00:58:30,836
The Royal flower bed

909
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:33,999
For painting my roses red

910
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:36,203
Someone will lose his head

911
00:58:36,287 --> 00:58:38,960
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!

912
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:41,515
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!

913
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:43,962
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!

914
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:46,686
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!

915
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:48,837
Off with their heads!

916
00:58:52,047 --> 00:58:55,244
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red

917
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:58,205
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red

918
00:58:58,287 --> 00:59:00,847
Oh, they're going to
lose their heads

919
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:04,124
Silence!

920
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,277
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying--

921
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:10,519
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now,
uh, uh, let me see, my dear.

922
00:59:10,607 --> 00:59:13,724
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?

923
00:59:13,807 --> 00:59:17,038
Why, it's a little girl.

924
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:20,119
- Yes. A-And I was hoping--
- Look up. Speak nicely.

925
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:22,846
And don't twiddle
your fingers!

926
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,600
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.

927
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,965
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:

928
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:33,881
''Yes, Your Majesty.''

929
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:37,277
''Yes, Your Majesty.''

930
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:43,045
Now, um, where do you come from,
and where are you going?

931
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:45,243
W-Well, I-I'm trying
to find my way home.

932
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:49,798
Your way? All ways
here are my ways!

933
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,606
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking--

934
00:59:52,687 --> 00:59:56,566
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.

935
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:58,922
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask--

936
00:59:59,007 --> 01:00:00,645
I'll ask the questions!

937
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:03,605
Do you play croquet?

938
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,919
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!

939
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,075
To your places. To your places. By order
of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

940
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:16,238
Shuffle deck!

941
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:21,525
Card cut! Deal cards!

942
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:24,326
Cards, halt!

943
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:56,837
Silence!

944
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:59,203
Off with his head!

945
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:02,677
Off with his head. Off with
his head. By order of the King.
Uh, you heard what she said.

946
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:06,282
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but--

947
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:09,957
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

948
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:32,397
Oh!

949
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:38,078
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible--

950
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,998
Do you want us both
to lose our heads?

951
01:02:40,087 --> 01:02:42,840
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.

952
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:18,119
Uh, I say, how are
you getting on?

953
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,323
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?

954
01:03:20,407 --> 01:03:22,238
I said, not at all!

955
01:03:22,327 --> 01:03:24,602
Who are you talking to?

956
01:03:24,687 --> 01:03:27,963
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?

957
01:03:28,047 --> 01:03:30,880
There. Oh.

958
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:33,879
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child,

959
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:36,845
if I lose my temper,
you lose your head!

960
01:03:36,927 --> 01:03:39,839
Understand?

961
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:44,443
You know, we could make her
really angry. Shall we try?

962
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:47,041
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.

963
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,516
No, no, no! Stop!

964
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,838
Oh, no!

965
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,918
Oh, my fur and whiskers!

966
01:03:55,007 --> 01:03:57,237
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.

967
01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:59,795
Someone's head
will roll for this!

968
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:04,116
Yours!

969
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,005
- Off with her--
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.

970
01:04:07,087 --> 01:04:11,000
Uh, couldn't she have
a trial? Huh? First?

971
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:16,445
- Trial?
-Well, th--Just a, a little trial? Hmm?

972
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:19,883
Hmm. Very well, then.

973
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:22,756
Let the trial begin!

974
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:35,159
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.

975
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:38,364
Loyal subjects.

976
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:40,756
And the King.

977
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:44,806
The prisoner at the bar is
charged with enticing Her
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts,

978
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,481
into a game of croquet
and thereby willfully...

979
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:50,365
-But--
-and with malice aforethought,
teasing, tormenting...

980
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:53,200
- and otherwise annoying our beloved--
- Never mind all that!

981
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:56,085
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.

982
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:59,478
Thereby causing the Queen
to lose her temper.

983
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:04,595
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?

984
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:07,406
Sentence? Oh, but there
must be a verdict first.

985
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,684
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.

986
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,918
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are--

987
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:16,316
Your ways, Your Majesty.

988
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:19,956
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her--

989
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:22,436
- But consider, my dear.
Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?

990
01:05:22,527 --> 01:05:25,644
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe
one or two? Huh? Maybe?

991
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:29,766
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!

992
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:33,476
-First witness. First witness.
Herald, call the first witness.
-The March Hare.

993
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:41,485
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know
about this, uh, unfortunate affair?

994
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:43,637
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?

995
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:47,845
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!

996
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:50,282
Jury, write that down.

997
01:05:53,007 --> 01:05:55,965
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.

998
01:05:56,047 --> 01:05:58,959
Silence! Next witness.

999
01:05:59,047 --> 01:06:00,878
The Dormouse.

1000
01:06:05,687 --> 01:06:07,643
- Well--
- Shh!

1001
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:10,082
What have you to
say about this?

1002
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:14,445
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder--

1003
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:18,406
That's the most important piece
of evidence we've heard yet.

1004
01:06:18,487 --> 01:06:20,842
Write that down!

1005
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:23,566
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.

1006
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,605
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?

1007
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,564
The Mad Hatter.

1008
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:36,797
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!

1009
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:39,720
And, uh, where were you when
this horrible crime was committed?

1010
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:41,923
I was home drinking tea.

1011
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:44,521
Today, you know,
is my unbirthday.

1012
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,838
Why, my dear, today is
your unbirthday too.

1013
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:49,963
- It is?
- It is?

1014
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,878
It is?

1015
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:55,039
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?

1016
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:57,800
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday

1017
01:06:57,887 --> 01:06:59,718
- For me?
- For you!

1018
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:03,356
Now blow the candle out, my dear,
and make your wish come true.

1019
01:07:06,327 --> 01:07:09,717
A very merry unbirthday

1020
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:12,924
To you

1021
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:15,157
Oh! Your Majesty.

1022
01:07:15,247 --> 01:07:17,886
Uh, yes, my dear?

1023
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,798
Look! There he is now!

1024
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:22,845
- Huh? Wha-- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.

1025
01:07:22,927 --> 01:07:24,758
- Cat!
- Cat?

1026
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:26,724
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!

1027
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:29,879
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!

1028
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:32,640
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.

1029
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:36,322
-Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
-The jam! The jam! By order of the King.

1030
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:39,479
The jam. Let me have it!

1031
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:48,445
Somebody's head is
going to roll for this!

1032
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:52,202
- Aha!
- The mushroom.

1033
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:54,926
Off with her h--

1034
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:01,795
Oh, pooh. I'm not
afraid of you.

1035
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:05,566
Why, you're nothing
but a pack of cards.

1036
01:08:05,647 --> 01:08:09,686
Rule 42: ''All persons
more than a mile high...

1037
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,723
must leave the court
immediately.''

1038
01:08:11,807 --> 01:08:14,765
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.

1039
01:08:15,807 --> 01:08:17,957
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

1040
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:22,723
And as for you,
Your Majesty--

1041
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,763
Your Majesty indeed.

1042
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,315
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a,

1043
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:32,401
a fat, pompous, bad-tempered,
old ty-- tyrant.

1044
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:39,163
And, uh, what were you
saying, my dear?

1045
01:08:39,247 --> 01:08:43,445
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.

1046
01:08:43,527 --> 01:08:45,836
Off with her head!

1047
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:53,762
You heard what
Her Majesty said.

1048
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:55,678
Off with her head.

1049
01:09:18,407 --> 01:09:20,796
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again

1050
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:23,355
No one ever loses and
no one can ever win

1051
01:09:23,447 --> 01:09:25,961
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

1052
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:27,844
- Never let the--
- Off with her head!

1053
01:09:27,927 --> 01:09:30,122
Off with her head!

1054
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:33,722
Just a moment! You can't
leave a tea party without
having a cup of tea, you know.

1055
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:36,401
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.

1056
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:39,160
You must join us
in a cup of tea.

1057
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:45,480
Off with her head!

1058
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:48,127
Mr Caterpillar,
what will I do?

1059
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:50,084
Who are you?

1060
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:55,804
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!

1061
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,037
Off with her head!

1062
01:10:02,607 --> 01:10:05,724
Oh! Still locked, you know.

1063
01:10:05,807 --> 01:10:08,560
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!

1064
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:11,320
- But you are outside.
- What?

1065
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,159
See for yourself.

1066
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,397
Why-- Why, that's me!

1067
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:18,718
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!

1068
01:10:18,807 --> 01:10:23,039
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!

1069
01:10:23,127 --> 01:10:26,563
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!

1070
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:29,400
Alice! Alice. Alice.

1071
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:31,796
Alice. Alice.

1072
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:34,959
Will you kindly pay attention
and recite your lesson?

1073
01:10:35,047 --> 01:10:39,882
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little
crocodile improve his shining tail?

1074
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:44,518
- And pour the waters of the--
- Alice, what are you talking about?

1075
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:48,122
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see,
the caterpillar said--

1076
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:51,802
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.

1077
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:56,358
Alice, I-- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.

1078
01:10:56,447 --> 01:11:01,601
Alice in Wonderland

1079
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:07,478
Over the hill
Or here or there

1080
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:13,199
I wonder where

1081
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:29,916
Alice in Wonderland

1082
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:33,886
How do you get
to Wonderland

1083
01:11:33,967 --> 01:11:37,880
Over the hill
Or under land

1084
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:42,438
Orjust behind the tree

1085
01:11:42,527 --> 01:11:47,476
Alice in Wonderland

1086
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:52,436
Where is the path
to Wonderland

1087
01:11:52,527 --> 01:11:57,999
Over the hill
Or here or there

1088
01:11:58,087 --> 01:12:02,683
I wonder where

1089
01:12:04,087 --> 01:13:04,087
