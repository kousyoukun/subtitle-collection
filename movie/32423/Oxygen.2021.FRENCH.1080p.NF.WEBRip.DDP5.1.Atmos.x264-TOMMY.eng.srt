00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,458
<i>I'm gonna die.</i>

349
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,166
<i>Incoming call.</i>

350
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,250
MILO, accept.

351
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,083
<i>-Elizabeth, are you there?</i>
-Yes, hello.

352
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,208
-Yes.
<i>-And you…</i>

353
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,625
MILO, boost the network.

354
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,125
<i>Network amplification underway.</i>

355
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,291
Can you hear me?

356
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,291
<i>Got her.</i>

357
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,625
<i>Liz, listen. We have the subpoena.</i>
<i>My men are at Cryosalide.</i>

358
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,916
You have the codes?

359
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
<i>Yes, we'll get them shortly.</i>

360
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,333
<i>It's nearly over, Liz.</i>

361
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,000
-You've got me?
<i>-We've got you.</i>

362
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,708
Captain Moreau?

363
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,875
-Moreau?
<i>-It's going to be okay.</i>

364
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,458
There's a problem, right?

365
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,708
Tell me what's going on.

366
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,250
<i>Oxygen level: 17%.</i>

367
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,750
What? Seventeen percent?

368
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:09,000
Seventeen percent? But I was at 20%.

369
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,000
<i>What's happening, Liz? Talk to me.</i>

370
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,708
I don't know. I'm losing track of time.

371
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,541
I see images. I see things.

372
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,000
<i>No, Liz. Listen to me carefully.</i>

373
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,750
<i>You're experiencing a psychotic episode</i>
<i>induced by isolation.</i>

374
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,166
<i>Liz, prisoners of war go through that too.</i>

375
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,625
Your number that wasn't assigned,

376
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,666
was that real or not?

377
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,583
<i>What? No, we were cut off. I didn't move.</i>

378
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,541
<i>I kept trying to reach you.</i>

379
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,416
<i>Liz, pull yourself together.</i>

380
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,166
<i>Focus on what you know is real.</i>

381
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,375
<i>Focus on your body,</i>
<i>on what you know is real.</i>

382
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,083
<i>Find a way to focus on your body.</i>

383
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,083
Okay.

384
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,916
<i>Elizabeth, are you there?</i>

385
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,125
<i>Liz?</i>

386
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,875
{\an8}<i>-Are you still there?</i>
<i>-Injury detected on bio-form.</i>

387
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,833
{\an8}<i>-Hello? Liz…</i>
<i>-Status: no threat to life.</i>

388
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,250
<i>Liz?</i>

389
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,208
<i>Liz, talk to me.</i>

390
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,166
Are you sure you want to do it?

391
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,625
Yeah.

392
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,458
<i>Hello, Liz?</i>

393
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,333
{\an8}NAME: FERGUSON LÉO
HOSPITAL: CLARA DANIELS HOSPITAL

394
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,416
{\an8}<i>Liz, please.</i>

395
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:57,416
<i>Intravenous antibiotic administered</i>
<i>to prevent infection.</i>

396
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,791
<i>Antibiotics? Why, Liz? What did you do?</i>

397
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,416
I focused on what's real.

398
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,125
How long have I been missing?

399
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,750
<i>You were active on social media</i>
<i>a few days ago.</i>

400
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,750
<i>And no one has reported you missing.</i>

401
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,250
I have a husband. Léo.

402
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,791
<i>And I think we were trying to have kids.</i>

403
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,500
<i>-Léo?</i>
-Yes.

404
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,250
What? Who are you talking to?

405
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,375
<i>-No one.</i>
-Is it about Léo?

406
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,291
<i>No.</i>

407
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:31,958
<i>Is he well?</i>

408
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:35,291
<i>Find Léo. He'll know what happened.</i>

409
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,208
<i>Listen to me.</i>

410
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,291
<i>According to our information,</i>
<i>you were never married.</i>

411
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,666
What?

412
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,166
No, no, no.

413
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,833
We were trying to have kids.

414
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,208
MILO, search for Dr. Léo Ferguson.

415
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,375
<i>No result.</i>

416
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,791
What?

417
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,708
That's not possible. It's not.

418
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,958
He was there. No, that's not possible.

419
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,500
RESULTS FOR
"FERGUSON"

420
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,708
That's not possible.

421
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:05,500
MILO, search for Dr. Elizabeth Hansen
at the Science and Technology Awards.

422
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,333
No.

423
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:11,000
No.

424
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,333
<i>-Elizabeth.</i>
-No, no, no…

425
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,625
That's impossible.
We were both in the photo.

426
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,125
We were together. He was there.

427
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:20,250
I called him. Someone answered.

428
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,375
A woman. She knew him.

429
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,000
<i>-What woman?</i>
-A woman…

430
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,708
<i>-What did you say to her?</i>
<i>-</i>Nothing. She hung up.

431
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,958
She knew him.

432
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,250
She knew him. She knew Léo.

433
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,708
<i>No, she wasn't real.</i>

434
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What's going on?

435
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,833
<i>Liz, listen to me. Léo isn't real either.</i>

436
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,458
-He was real.
<i>-Yes, I know.</i>

437
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,416
<i>I know you're convinced of it.</i>

438
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,958
<i>Your mind's playing tricks on you,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

439
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,208
<i>To help you to keep going.</i>

440
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,083
<i>You have to trust me. I'll get you out.</i>

441
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,333
You're lying to me.

442
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,875
<i>You played basketball.</i>

443
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,458
What?

444
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,333
<i>At college. You were gifted.</i>

445
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,083
<i>I thought you'd like</i>
<i>to hear something about yourself</i>,

446
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,375
<i>and during my search, that struck me.</i>

447
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,708
Basketball?

448
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,625
<i>Yes.</i>

449
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,958
<i>It stood out from the rest.</i>

450
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,166
<i>Doctorate in bioengineering,</i>
<i>grants, awards…</i>

451
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,583
<i>You are impressive.</i>

452
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,291
<i>Does it ring a bell?</i>

453
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,625
No.

454
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,125
<i>You were born in Stockholm.</i>

455
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,541
<i>Your mother was single</i>
<i>and raised you alone.</i>

456
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:32,166
<i>She brought you here</i>
<i>when you were six years old.</i>

457
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,375
Alice. Her name's Alice.

458
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:36,291
<i>No.</i>

459
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,916
Her name isn't Alice?

460
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
<i>Isabelle.</i>

461
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,916
No, no, no. I can see her.

462
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,916
<i>-No, Liz…</i>
<i>-I can see her.</i>

463
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,041
<i>Liz, never mind. Stay with me.</i>

464
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,708
<i>You went to Oxford</i>
<i>after medical school in Paris.</i>

465
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,916
Oxford.

466
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,791
I remember Oxford. That's where I met Léo.

467
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,708
<i>That's where I met him.</i>
<i>He's real. I know he is.</i>

468
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:58,625
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

469
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,750
Look for Léo. I swear he exists.

470
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,791
<i>Oxygen level: 15%.</i>

471
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:07,375
<i>-Alert. Blood pressure at 210/130.</i>
-Where are you? You should have found me.

472
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,291
<i>Stay strong. Just a few more minutes.</i>

473
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,833
I need the codes.

474
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,833
<i>I have guys at Cryosalide</i>
<i>getting the codes.</i>

475
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:17,666
But why? What? It's taking too long.

476
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,875
Who are you talking to?

477
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,625
What? Hello?

478
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:26,416
Who are you talking to?
I hear you talking to someone.

479
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,083
<i>-You're hearing things.</i>
-You're talking. No, no.

480

<i>Liz. We're on it. We're close.</i>
<i>We're really close.</i>

481
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,750
-You're lying.
<i>-We're 20 minutes away.</i>

482
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,750
-Are you doing this to me?
<i>-We're nearly there.</i>

483
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,583
<i>I was in the army.</i>
<i>I spent months underground.</i>

484
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:40,958
You're doing this to me.

485
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:44,125
<i>I've been in that situation.</i>
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

<i>You called me, looking for Léo.</i>

522
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,166
<i>Listen, we don't have much time.</i>

523
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,041
<i>It wasn't supposed to happen like this.</i>

524
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,583
<i>Something must have gone wrong.</i>

525
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,916
-I want to talk to Léo.
<i>-Impossible.</i>

526
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,041
<i>You must listen to me. I can help you.</i>

527
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,583
I won't listen until I speak to Léo.

528
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:24,666
<i>That's impossible.</i>

529
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,666
I want to talk to him now. Put him on now.

530
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,083
<i>Léo is dead.</i>

531
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,250
What?

532
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,708
I don't believe you.

533
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,416
<i>You really need to listen to me.</i>

534
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>-Liz… No.</i>
-Go to hell.

535
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,250
-MILO, end the call.
<i>-No, wait--</i>

536
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:46,083
<i>Call ended. Oxygen level: 14%.</i>

537
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,250
<i>Incoming call.</i>

538
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:51,625
<i>Incoming call.</i>

539
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,458
MILO, accept call.

540
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,500
<i>Listen to me.</i>

541
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,500
<i>I can help you.</i>

542
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,708
<i>No one else can help you</i>
<i>at this point, Liz.</i>

543
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,916
How do you know my name? I never told you.

544
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,833
<i>No need. I knew who you were</i>
<i>the moment I heard your voice,</i>

545
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,458
<i>even though I couldn't believe it.</i>

546
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,166
Tell me who you are and the others.

547
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,125
<i>I don't know who you spoke to,</i>
<i>but I know what's going on.</i>

548
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,666
-MILO, end--
<i>-I know the codes.</i>

549
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,583
Give them to me.

550
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,458
<i>-I'll do that, but you have to listen--</i>
-Give them to me.

551
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,666
<i>You can't use them to open the unit.</i>

552
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,708
-MILO, end the--
<i>-Okay, okay.</i>

553
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:34,833
<i>Uppercase N-M-347.</i>

554
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:38,500
<i>Lowercase C-D-A.</i>

555
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,208
Transfer of administrator control.

556
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:48,750
<i>Administrator control transfer launched.</i>
<i>Enter the password.</i>

557
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:54,750
Uppercase N-M-347. Lowercase C-D-A.

558
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,291
<i>Liz, don't open it. Please.</i>

559
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:02,916
<i>Administrator control transfer complete.</i>
<i>Administrator privileges granted.</i>

560
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:10,291
MILO, unlock.

561
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,583
<i>Unlocking activated.</i>

562
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,000
<i>Please, no. You'll die.</i>

563
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:19,541
<i>I can prove it.</i>
<i>If you open the unit, you'll die.</i>

564
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,083
MILO, pause unlocking.
You have ten seconds.

565
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,125
<i>Thank you. Just let me explain.</i>

566
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,750
-Eight seconds.
<i>-Okay, okay!</i>

567
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,875
<i>Go to "system preferences."</i>

568
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,250
<i>Find the centrifuge controls.</i>

569
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,583
-System preferences.
<i>-Please. Just let me explain.</i>

570
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:34,000
Centrifuge controls.

571
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,541
Got them.

572
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,500
<i>It's set at one. Switch to…</i>

573
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,500
Switch to what?

574
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,041
<i>-This isn't how you should find out.</i>
-Switch to what?

575
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,458
MILO…

576
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,416
{\an8}<i>Zero. Switch to zero.</i>

577
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,541
{\an8}Switch to zero.

578
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,208
<i>Please, Liz. Don't do it.</i>

579
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,541
<i>Turning off microthrusters.</i>

580
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,625
<i>I'm sorry, Liz. I really am.</i>

581
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:11,666
<i>Alert. Lengthy exposure to weightlessness</i>
<i>can be harmful to the bio-form.</i>

582
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,333
<i>Liz.</i>

583
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,916
<i>Liz!</i>

584
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:28,791
Where am I?

585
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:32,583
<i>Around 40,389 miles from Earth.</i>

586
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,250
No, no, no.

587
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,875
MILO, distance from Earth?

588
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,875
<i>Forty two thousand, seven hundred</i>
<i>and thirty-five miles.</i>

589
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,916
That's not possible.

590
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:52,333
<i>Sorry, Liz. But time is limited.</i>

591
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:56,750
<i>You'll soon be beyond the range</i>
<i>of our communication satellites.</i>

592
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,416
THRUST INITIALIZATION? CANCEL - OK

593
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,750
<i>Centrifuge rotation launched.</i>
<i>G-1 launched.</i>

594
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,833
<i>Oxygen level: 13%.</i>

595
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,250
<i>Liz, please.</i>

596
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,750
<i>You were placed in hypersleep</i>
<i>to allow you to carry out your mission.</i>

597
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,291
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

598
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,458
<i>I can't bring you home.</i>

599
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,625
<i>But I designed the system,</i>

600
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,458
<i>and maybe we could</i>
<i>put you back into hypersleep.</i>

601
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,333
<i>It would give you a chance. Please.</i>

602
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:28,916
What mission?

603
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,666
<i>If we can locate the damage,</i>
<i>divert the affected systems…</i>

604
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,833
What mission?

605
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:41,708
<i>Colonizing a planet</i>
<i>orbiting around Wolf 10-61,</i>

606
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,875
<i>14 light-years from Earth.</i>

607
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,500
<i>But you only just left.</i>

608
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:50,333
<i>Your HIVE transporter hasn't yet engaged</i>
<i>its nuclear-powered thrust.</i>

609
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,916
No, no, no.

610
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,833
<i>Liz, we have to act fast.</i>

611
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,500
This isn't real.

612
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:14,791
Was it a military operation?
Do I work for the Ministry of Defense?

613
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,541
<i>Yes. Do you remember?</i>

614
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,750
Why the army?

615
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:21,708
<i>The human race will die out</i>
<i>in two generations.</i>

616
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,708
<i>That can't be made public.</i>

617
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,333
Did he know?

618
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,416
<i>Who?</i>

619
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,041
That guy. Moreau.

620
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,750
When I asked for help, he was kind,

621
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,583
-but he was lying to me, right?
<i>-Liz.</i>

622
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,125
<i>He had no choice.</i>

623
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:42,083
<i>As soon as the police</i>
<i>looked for information about you,</i>

624
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,541
<i>the Ministry got involved.</i>

625
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:48,000
<i>Everything said after that</i>
<i>was only what they wanted you to hear.</i>

626
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:48,916
But why?

627
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,958
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?

628
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,125
<i>The fog of memory.</i>

629
00:53:56,208 --> 00:54:00,875
<i>It was impossible to foresee your reaction</i>
<i>or the memories that would return first.</i>

630
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,666
<i>You're a threat.</i>

631
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:06,000
<i>Speak to the wrong person,</i>
<i>and it all goes public.</i>

632
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:11,166
<i>General panic, chaos.</i>
<i>They couldn't take that risk.</i>

633
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,291
I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.

634
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,708
He didn't tell me Léo was dead.
He said he wasn't real.

635
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:23,583
<i>Liz, everything… I mean everything…</i>
<i>Everything was done</i>

636
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,958
<i>from the moment they realized</i>
<i>you'd regained consciousness</i>

637
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,250
<i>to prevent you</i>
<i>from recovering your memory.</i>

638
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,250
So he was playing for time.

639
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,500
He was waiting…

640
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,000
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.

641
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,750
Léo was real…

642
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,291
and he's dead.

643
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,875
<i>Yes.</i>

644
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,000
Twelve percent.

645
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,750
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

646
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,333
What happened to him?

647
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,208
<i>He was sick.</i>

648
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:26,958
<i>Léo got sick,</i>

649
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,750
<i>like millions of others</i>
<i>who were killed by the virus.</i>

650
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,416
<i>Liz?</i>

651
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,541
<i>No, no, no. That doesn't add up.</i>

652
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,333
They said I went missing three days ago.

653
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,041
<i>You've been in hypersleep</i>
<i>much longer than that.</i>

654
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,375
How long?

655
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,000
How long?

656
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,416
<i>Twelve years.</i>

657
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,291
<i>I'm really sorry, Liz.</i>

658
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:11,000
<i>You're wasting your time and your oxygen.</i>

659
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,875
<i>In ten minutes, you'll be out of range,</i>
<i>and we won't be able to communicate.</i>

660
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,083
<i>Either you die alone,</i>
<i>or you help me to solve the problem</i>

661
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,875
<i>-and give yourself a chance.</i>
-No.

662
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,083
<i>-I know what I'd choose.</i>
-Okay, okay, okay.

663
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,000
Where do we begin?

664
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,666
<i>Okay, first we need to figure out</i>
<i>what woke you up.</i>

665
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:34,291
MILO, why was the bio-form awakened?

666
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:39,583
<i>Processor 3-54 overheating</i>
<i>due to loss of oxygen reserves.</i>

667
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:41,250
What is processor 3-54 used for?

668
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:45,458
<i>Processor 3-54 monitors and stimulates</i>
<i>the subject's cerebral activity</i>

669
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:47,125
<i>to avoid cellular atrophy.</i>

670
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,833
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.

671
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,208
<i>I agree.</i>

672
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,708
<i>We must divert</i>
<i>the cerebral activity monitor</i>

673
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,041
<i>to another processor</i>
<i>assigned to non-essential functions.</i>

674
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:02,291
MILO, list all the processors
linked to non-essential functions.

675
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:06,708
<i>All functions assigned to processor 694.</i>

676
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,708
Is there any danger to the bio-form

677
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,041
if all functions of processor 694
are deactivated?

678
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,916
<i>Zero danger for the bio-form.</i>

679
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,958
So, go on. Go on, deactivate them.

680
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,250
<i>Deactivation underway.</i>

681
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,458
MILO,

682
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:35,000
transfer all functions
of processor 3-54 to 694.

683
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,708
<i>The data exceeds processor capacity.</i>

684
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,291
Damn.

685
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,416
Shit.

686
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,708
What do we do now?

687
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,583
<i>We have to make</i>
<i>some difficult choices now.</i>

688
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,166
<i>Deactivate systems</i>
<i>that don't have priority.</i>

689
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,166
<i>Find…</i>

690
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,625
<i>Too late. They're here!</i>

691
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,625
<i>-Find a way to install a shunt…</i>
-What do you mean, they're here?

692
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,083
<i>Return to hypersleep.</i>

693
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,666
<i>But do it</i>
<i>before the oxygen hits two percent,</i>

694
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,875
<i>or you won't have enough</i>
<i>for resuscitation.</i>

695
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,958
But I won't know how to do it.

696
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,166
<i>You do know. You have all the answers.</i>

697
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,375
<i>Figure out what triggers your memories,</i>
<i>then you'll find those you need.</i>

698
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,958
You designed it. I won't know how.

699
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,083
<i>On the ground!</i>

700
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,916
-Hello?
<i>-Right now!</i>

701
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,833
<i>-No.</i>
-Hello?

702
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:19,000
<i>Find what triggers your memories.</i>

703
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,166
<i>Get on the floor!</i>

704
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,541
<i>-Two percent. Find Léo.</i>
<i>-On the floor, I said!</i>

705
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,916
<i>Find Léo.</i>

706
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,000
<i>Connection lost.</i>

707
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,416
Shit, shit, shit. MILO, reconnect.

708
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,916
<i>This number is unassigned.</i>
<i>Please check the number.</i>

709
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,916
Don't leave me alone, please.

710
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:51,916
Okay.

711
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,958
Okay, okay, okay. I worked on this thing.

712
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,166
I worked on it.

713
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:01,791
MILO, who authorized Omicron 267's
participation in this mission?

714
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:07,458
<i>Participation of Omicron 267</i>
<i>authorized by Hansen, Elizabeth, Dr.</i>

715
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,291
Yeah, of course.

716
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,750
So that's me. That's me.

717
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,333
It's me.

718
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,500
A thing only I know. Only I know.

719
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,750
"Find Léo." What does "find Léo" mean?

720
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,625
What does it mean?

721
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,458
What does it mean, damn it, "find Léo"?

722
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,625
What does it mean?

723
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,875
How do I do it?

724
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,375
<i>Oxygen level: 11%.</i>

725
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:39,833
Okay. Think.

726
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,291
MILO, show me all low-priority processors.

727
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,416
Okay, okay, okay.

728
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:51,750
Okay.

729
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,541
Too many. There are too many.

730
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,958
Explain kinetic regulation.

731
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:06,916
<i>Kinetic regulation delivers</i>
<i>weak electric impulses to muscle groups</i>

732
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,625
<i>to prevent atrophy.</i>

733
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,583
Okay. And if we deactivate it,
what happens?

734
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,208
<i>Degeneration of muscular tissue.</i>

735
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,125
And that's considered low priority, right?

736
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:19,583
<i>Yes, because the bio-form</i>
<i>would survive the journey.</i>

737
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,250
To die on being resuscitated.

738
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,375
<i>The bio-form would survive</i>
<i>between three hours and ten days.</i>

739
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:29,541
MILO, limit results to only processes
that can be interrupted

740
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,791
without reducing life expectancy.

741
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,166
<i>No non-priority processes</i>
<i>can be interrupted</i>

742
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,000
<i>without reducing life expectancy.</i>

743
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,458
Difficult choices.

744
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:43,375
Find what triggers the memories.

745
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,666
Come on.

746
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,958
If you have something to say,
now's the time.

747
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,666
I'm out of my mind.

748
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:34,708
<i>Warning. Any deliberate damage</i>
<i>to a Cryosalide unit</i>

749
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,125
<i>is a European federal offense</i>
<i>punishable by ten years imprisonment.</i>

750
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,916
So go on, electrocute me.

751
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,958
<i>Warning.</i>

752
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,125
<i>Warning.</i>

753
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:41,125
<i>Warning.</i>

754
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,291
Don't you worry.

755
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,375
We'll meet again.

756
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,541
And that's our entry system.

757
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:26,458
<i>MILO, search for Alice Hansen in Paris.</i>

758
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:27,750
<i>One result.</i>

759
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,083
<i>Call that contact.</i>

760
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,125
<i>No network detected.</i>

761
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,541
Amplify transmission.

762
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,208
<i>Transmission amplified.</i>
<i>Attempted connection.</i>

763
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,750
<i>Hello?</i>

764
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:54,916
Mom?

765
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,416
<i>Sweetheart? Is that you?</i>

766
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,291
<i>What's wrong?</i>

767
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,083
<i>I think…</i>

768
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:09,333
<i>What? I can't hear you…</i>

769
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,416
I just wanted to hear your voice.

770
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:18,125
<i>Liz, my love, what's going on?</i>

771
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,083
I don't think anyone will come.

772
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:30,291
<i>Who won't come? Is everything all…</i>

773
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:35,500
I tried to find him.
I don't know where else to look.

774
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,166
I'm supposed to know, but I don't.

775
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,958
<i>Why didn't you come to see me on Sunday?</i>

776
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:46,958
<i>It's not good for you,</i>
<i>being alone in that house.</i>

777
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:52,541
<i>I'll come to see you.</i>
<i>No, even better, you come here.</i>

778
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:55,416
<i>Spend a little time with me.</i>

779
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,750
He won't tell me what to do.

780
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:03,458
<i>Are you in a car? I can hardly hear you.</i>

781
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:07,083
No, I'm in…

782
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:13,250
<i>What? You shouldn't call while driving.</i>

783
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,666
I'm in…

784
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,458
<i>Are you there? Liz…</i>

785
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,166
I love you, Mom.

786
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:29,291
<i>I can't hear… what… saying…</i>

787
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,625
I was saying I love you.

<i>once the oxygen runs out.</i>

793
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:44,125
And how long will Omicron 267 live
during decompression in outer space?

794
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,833
<i>It is estimated</i>
<i>that the subject should remain conscious</i>

<i>Unlocking is not recommended at this time.</i>

799
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:13,750
Transfer control and unlock.

<i>Visual already created.</i>

823
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,208
No. I want a visual of the other units.

<i>Visual of the cryogenic units</i>
<i>already established.</i>

I remember that

that we didn't have any

939
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:46,375
But it's crazy because I feel that
like a gap inside of me.

940
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:49,250
It's absurd.

941
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,083

I imagine the promise was that

1033
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,958
we'd wake together,

1034
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,750
<i>but I won't be there.</i>

1035
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,041
<i>I've tried everything.</i>

1036
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,708
I'm not the only one lost…

1037
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:52,125
I'm not the only one lost.
There are others.

1038
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:54,833
There are others.

1039
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,041
MILO, end of recording.

1040
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:02,750
<i>Recording ended.</i>

1041
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,166
Goodbye, Léo.

1042
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:16,333
<i>Oxygen level: 0,6%</i>

1043
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,083
The others!

1044
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:46,416
MILO, how much oxygen
is left in the lost units?

1045
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,333
<i>One hundred eighty-seven lost units</i>
<i>are at full capacity.</i>

1046
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:52,791
Divert the oxygen
from the lost units to unit 267.

1047
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,125
<i>Diversion impossible to carry out now.</i>

1048
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:59,708
<i>Access to individual oxygen reserves</i>
<i>is limited for security reasons.</i>

1049
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:03,958
<i>It will require</i>
<i>approximately 14,227 minutes</i>

1050
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:06,750
<i>to ignore the security restriction.</i>

1051
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,791
<i>It is recommended</i>
<i>placing the bio-form in hypersleep</i>

1052
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,291
<i>for reasons</i>
<i>of preservation during the maneuver.</i>

1053
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:20,250
Can you do that, MILO?

1054
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:23,125
<i>Do you want to begin</i>
<i>the return to hypersleep protocol</i>

1055
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:25,166
<i>while I carry out the maneuver?</i>

1056
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,833
Yes.

1057
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:36,125
I could kiss you right now. Yes.

1058
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,500
Launch the hypersleep protocol.

1059
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:43,500
<i>Return to hypersleep protocol launched.</i>

1060
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:45,333
<i>Would you like a sedative?</i>

1061
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,791
Yes.

1062
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,750
<i>Administration underway.</i>

1063
01:30:56,375 --> 01:31:00,875
<i>Initialization of cryoprotector</i>
<i>transfusion for vitrification.</i>

1064
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:06,666
<i>Security lock bypass launched.</i>

1065
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:12,083
<i>Body temperature: 98,7°F.</i>

1066
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,583
MILO, I'm sorry for hitting you.

1067
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,666
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

1068
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,958
MILO, tell me about the planet.

1069
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:28,458
What's it like?

1070
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:32,125
<i>Wolf 10-61c</i>
<i>has an orbital cycle of 18 days.</i>

1071
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,916
<i>Its mass</i>
<i>is around four times that of Earth.</i>

1072
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,083
<i>Its lack of rotation makes life impossible</i>

1073
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:42,375
<i>on its sun-facing side, which is too hot,</i>
<i>and on its dark side, which is too cold.</i>

1074
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:46,208
<i>The inhabitable area is therefore</i>
<i>on the border of day and night.</i>

1075
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,708
Tell me about the journey.

1076
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:53,833
<i>Once nuclear-powered thrust is engaged,</i>

1077
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:57,291
<i>it will take 34 years</i>
<i>to cover the 14 light-years</i>

1078
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,208
<i>between us and Wolf 10-61c.</i>

1079
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:07,041
<i>On arrival, the HIVE sowing vessel</i>
<i>will break up to free the 9,568 units</i>

1080
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:10,500
<i>that will enter</i>
<i>the atmosphere of Wolf 10-61c.</i>

1081
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:12,708
<i>Thanks to their individual</i>
<i>helix-shaped device--</i>

1082
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:16,708
MILO, tell me about the beach in Maui.

1083
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:21,416
<i>Kapalua Bay is a white-sand beach</i>
<i>in the shape of a crescent moon</i>

1084
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,708
<i>situated in the northwest of the island.</i>

1085
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:26,125
<i>It is protected by two coral reefs.</i>

1086
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,833
<i>The aquatic bio-forms include</i>

1087
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:35,916
<i>butterflyfish, parrotfish,</i>
<i>damselfish, blue surgeonfish,</i>

1088
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,500
<i>Moorish idols, Achilles tangs,</i>

1089
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:43,083
<i>wrasses, yellow boxfish,</i>

1090
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:47,708
<i>bluefish, triggerfish, yellowfin goatfish,</i>

1091
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:53,000
<i>porcupinefish,</i>
<i>crevalle jacks, trumpetfish…</i>

1092
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:53,916
MILO.

1093
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:58,041
Rename Omicron 267…

1094
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:00,416
Liz.

1095
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:04,083
<i>Omicron 267 renamed Liz.</i>

1096
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,041
Thank you.

1097
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,625
<i>Good night, Liz.</i>
