190

Which is weird, because
I've never heard anything

Whatever. Just don't get

since last Thursday, Tree.

324
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,091
Yeah, I remember. I...

325
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,562
Um...
(chuckles)

326
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,197
She finally rolls in.

327
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,567
That's so weird.

328
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,101
LORI:
You okay?

329
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,736
You were kind of a mess
last night.

330
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,172
Uh...

331
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:43,610
Oh, shit,
I'm so late for class.

332
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,147
(clears throat)

333
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:52,486
Did you really think you could
keep it a secret from me?

334
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:56,021
(chuckles softly)

335
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,822
Don't you want to know
how I found out?

336
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:58,990
Driver's license?

337
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,192
Clever girl.

338
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,127
That picture, though?

339
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,029
I got to go.

340
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,563
LORI:
But...

341
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,668
you-you didn't even
blow out the...

342
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,670
...candle.

343
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,105
DANIELLE: We really need
to step up our game

344
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:15,474
(echoing):
at these frat parties, okay?

345
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:16,841
And...

346
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,210
we still need to pick
this year's charity.

347
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,579
I can say right now
there's no way

348
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,246
we're doing the Special Needs
Art Fair again.

349
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:25,216
MAN: Get your school spirit on
before the big game.

350
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:29,122
Ten percent off
with your student ID.

351
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:35,092
(echoes):
T-shirts.

352

DANIELLE:
What's wrong, Tree?

353
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:42,133
Um, I'm just a little tired
I guess.

354
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:43,801
No, dumbass.

355
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,439
What's wrong with that?

356
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:49,573
So not Kappa cuisine.

357
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:52,276
And is that
chocolate milk I see?

358
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,178
I missed breakfast.

359
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,749
We all miss breakfast, Becky.

360
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,583
(mouths):
Becky.

361
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:00,987
- Becky, look out.

362

- CARTER: I'm...

363
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:06,224
- so sorry. I'm sorry, Tree.
- DANIELLE: Wait.

364
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,759
You two know each other?

365
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,727
- No.
- Yeah. I mean...

366
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,163
we had a...
a class together last year.

367
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,098
That's all.

368
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,167
- (Tree groans)
- I'm sorry about all this.

369
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,837
(Carter sighs)

370
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,839
Hey.

371
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,275
What?

372
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:25,310
My bracelet.

373
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:26,714
Oh.

374
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,719
You know, I'm sorry again
about... you know, the mess.

375
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:38,158
DANIELLE:
What a douchebag.

376
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,593
(sighs)
Hey, we can't do this today.

377
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:44,128
There's too much going on
in the building.

378
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,697
I need to talk to you.

379
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,800
(sighs)

380
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:51,669
Tree, I...

381
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,304
I know what you're gonna say.

382
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:54,606
You do?

383
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:57,742
Look, it's normal

384
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:01,946
for a young girl to have
feelings for an older man,

385
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,281
but you can't fall in love.

386
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:06,216
I'm not falling in love
with you.

387
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:08,019
You're not?

388
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,826
No. I've been having
the weirdest day and... mmm.

389
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:15,961
Your wife.

390
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:19,864
Uh, that's kind of a buzzkill.

392
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,367
WOMAN:
Gregory.

393
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:23,702
Are you in there?

394
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,139
Thank God you locked the door.

395
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,042

Hey, sweetie.

396
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:34,913
Uh, I didn't realize
I'd locked the door, um...

397
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:35,981
uh, just wrapping up here.

398

No.

Why?

901
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:38,841
We just got these back
from imaging,

902
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:40,776
and these are signs of...

903

major trauma.

904
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:45,515
I mean, given the severity
of the scar tissue

905
00:47:45,517 --> 00:47:47,520
and the size of the lesions...

906
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:52,789
This is gonna sound
crazy, but...

907
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:56,495
technically...
you should be dead.

908
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:02,566
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

909
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:04,466
- I need to get out of here.
- No way.

910
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:05,968
No, you need to stay here
for observation.

911
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:07,903
If I don't get out of here,
I'm gonna die.

Pardon me?

977
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:23,613
He's trying to kill me again.

- Again?
- Yes.

but this time I got away.

But I-I-I didn't have time
to grab my clothes

or any other

No!
That is what I'm trying to...

987
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:46,868
Wait.

988
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,839
If I am, does that mean that
you're going to arrest me

989
00:54:50,841 --> 00:54:52,341
and lock me in a jail cell?

990
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:54,676
That's how it usually works.

Uh, well...

then I'm gonna put you
under arrest.

998

That's a good idea.

Yeah, when I was a kid,

1136
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:48,591
I always got to skip school.

1137
01:01:48,593 --> 01:01:51,727
We'd go to the beach.

1138
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:56,765
My dad would buy us
this, like, huge birthday cake

1139
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,702
and put just one candle on it.

1140
01:01:59,704 --> 01:02:02,171
We'd blow it out together.

1141
01:02:02,173 --> 01:02:04,543
I bet you miss her.

1142
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:07,642
Yeah.

1143
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,611
You know what's funny?

1144
01:02:09,613 --> 01:02:13,783
You relive the same day over
and over again,

1145
01:02:13,785 --> 01:02:17,990
you kind of start to see
who you really are.

1146
01:02:19,457 --> 01:02:21,791
If my mom saw me now,

1147
01:02:21,793 --> 01:02:25,260
you know, who I've become,

1148
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:28,330
I don't think
she'd be very proud.

1149
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:29,698
Don't say that.

1150
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,636
It's true.

1151
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:35,439
I'm not a good person, Carter.

1152
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:39,477
Maybe this is karma.
Maybe I deserve it.

1153
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,649
Well, look, I don't...
know you all that well,

1154
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:49,117
but it's never too late
to change.

1155
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,153
I mean, especially
if what you're saying is true.

1156
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:53,354
Each new day is...

1157
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:55,825
it's a chance
to be somebody better.

1158
01:02:55,827 --> 01:02:58,794
See, that's just it.

1159
01:02:58,796 --> 01:03:02,768
I don't think
I have that many chances left.

1160
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:09,338
I keep on getting weaker
every time I come back.

1161
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,843
You know, maybe I'm like
that cat with nine lives.

1162

Eventually, I'm gonna run out.

TRAN:
...that left one officer dead.

1171
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:38,633
Tombs was the subject of

if Tombs is responsible

You've always been there
for me,

1303

but I've been way too selfish
to even appreciate it.

- Dr. Butler.

1315

I never should've
started seeing you.

1321

You have a wife
who loves you so much.

1331
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:00,868
So if you can't
be faithful to her,

1332
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,640
at least have the balls
to leave.

1333

Don't expect me to let you
coast by in my class now.

and disappointing it is

No.
