- Hands out, please.
- Stop fucking about...

161
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:29,884
Look here,
don't you use that language in here.

162
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:32,761
If you're gonna talk like that,
make your own suit.

163
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,306
- There you go.
- Tighter, it'll split.

164
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,225
- 30 shillings, please.
- I can bring it in that much.

165
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,269
- What about this?
- It'll split.

166
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:43,105
- I want it by Saturday.
- Saturday, yeah.

167
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:46,150
- What do you think?
- Fucking rent-a-tent, innit?

168
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:51,405
- How much?
- Two pound, nine pence, please.

169
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,325
- Sorry, I have no smaller change.
- Don't matter.

170
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:57,870
Thank you.

171
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:03,250
- All right, darlin'?
- Saturdays, I hate 'em.

172
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:05,669
Thought I'd drop by and say hello.

173
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:08,005
Been up to no good
while I been graftin'?

174
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,008
Nah, not really.
I just been down to pay me suit off.

175
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,135
- Yeah? What's it like?
- Handsome.

176
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:17,514
Three buttons. Side vents.
16-inch bottoms. Dark brown.

177
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:21,310
Have I got to wait here all day
while you finish your conversation?

178
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,687
I'm wearing it down to Brighton.

179
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,523
Gonna be one of the faces down there?

180
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:30,236
What do you mean going to be?
I am one of the faces.

- Chalky, the ponce. He's about again.

188
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:07,231
I ain't had a decent blot for days.

189
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,317
What happened, then?
You get banged up in Margate?

190
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:14,571
In Shepherd's Bush. My old man ain't
let me out the house since Margate.

191
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,407
Put a padlock on me scooter.

192
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:19,493
I went round last night

I tell you, I'd fuckin' do him.

196
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,502
- Seen his dad?
- He's 6'2".

197
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,129
How come you're so small?

198
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,548

- Genetic.

00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:35,551
- His nan's a midget.
- Party down Kitchener Road.

200
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,970
- What'd I tell you?
- It's that posh bird.

201
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,723
- Yeah, she's a right goer.
- Bristols out there.

202
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,975
- No chance.

00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,146
Dave, what's that...

204
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,607
Wanna go to a party? Everybody's going.

205
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:52,318
- Where?
- Kitchener Road.

206
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:53,610
All right, then.

207
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:57,197
Only takes 20 minutes, half an hour,
to get there on a scooter.

208
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,908
- Where you off to, then?
- I'll see you later.

209
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,286
- Yeah...
- Come on, Jim, give him a kiss.

210
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,630
Ferdy.

211
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:17,343
This is the place, lads.
Come on, then. Come on.

212
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,636
All right, John?

213
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:22,056
Yeah, straight in. No problems.

214
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:23,724
Come on.

215
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,444
- No gatecrashers.
- Gatecrashers?

216
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:37,404
He's calling us gatecrashers.

217
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,908
You didn't even bring any bottles.

218
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:44,161
- Piss off!
- Who the fuck are you? Prince Philip?

219
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,789
I happen to be the boyfriend
of the hostess.

220
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:49,041
No, you're fucking not!

221
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:52,586
Listen.
Look, this is Sandra's party, right?

222
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,838
Me and me mates have been invited...

223
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,423
John.

224
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,302
Here, where'd you get that shirt?

225
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,140
All right, Jim?

226
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,852
- Anything you fancy?
- Nothing there.

227
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,188
- I see you found a bird.
- I know her.

228
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:16,568
Here, that's mine, ain't it?
Can I have that one? Ta.

229
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,126
Here, Dan,
you seen what's goin' on in there?

230
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:34,711
Go in there, it's a laugh.
You'll love it.

231
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,675
Cheers.

232
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,432
- Penny for your thoughts.
- Oh, let's have some.

233
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,559
Come on, Monkey, don't mess about.

234

Not unless you give me something first.

What?

You always have to ask, don't you?

237

One, two, three for you.

238
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,835
- Where'd you get these?
- That'd be telling.

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,267
Saw the rushes today, Michael.

301
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:13,730
- The "people like you" film. And?
- I'd like you to look at them.

302
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:17,442
- Sure. What's the problem?
- The overall campaign's going well.

303
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:22,238
- Seen the posters?
- Yes. Gorgeous tart.

304
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,956
The trouble is the clients
are getting over-greedy.

305
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,374
As usual.

306
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,960
They want to corner
the entire youth market.

307
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:37,671
Cut right across the groupings.

308
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:39,839
Well, it's all right with As and Bs.

309
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:44,928
Training professionals, young managers,
graduates, that type of person.

310
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:49,182
It's Cs and Ds I'm worried about.

311
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,936
A little bit upmarket for them.

312
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:55,522
I'll have a look at it for you,
with pleasure.

313
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,232
- 2.30 all right?
- Fine.

314
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:01,027
You don't think this talk of lung cancer
will make any difference?

315
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:03,279
Oh, no. Young people like it.

316
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:07,242
They don't worry about that sort of
thing. Glad I gave it up when I did.

317
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:15,750
Psychopathic, that's what it was.
Making me feel...

318
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,420
Shut up, both of you, and listen to me.

319
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:22,757
Your next assignment is to get
that swine Sir Thomas Weller.

320
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:27,178
Weller? Why him?
Are you bonkers? He's the guv, ain't he?

321
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:29,222
Not any longer...

322
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:34,310
Where you been?

323
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:39,024
Fell asleep on the train.
I wound up in bloody Neasden.

324
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:44,279
Running about on motorbikes all night,
I'm not surprised. It's not normal.

325
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:47,157
In the middle of
a nice, quiet piece of scenery

326
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:48,825
and kick him to a pulp.

327
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:51,494
Oh, yeah? What's normal, then?

328
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:56,916
Let me do it.
I've got some new boots I can try out.

329
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,127
What's that?

330
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:03,631
Tonight, I want you to do
a little job for me personally.

331
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,613
Hello, Jim.

332
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,325
Thought I'd just pop by, like.

333
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,912
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, I don't mind. Come in.

334
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,371
Cheers.

335
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:39,334
- What's the matter, then?
- She's misfiring a bit.

336
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:40,877
Yeah?

337
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:45,548
It's your plug.
Got some tools on the bike. Hold up.

338
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:47,759
I'll go and have a look.

339
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,057
Gis a go at this.

340
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,105
You'll break your leg off that.
No wonder you wear them big boots.

341
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:02,732
That's the best bike ever made, mate.

342
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,527
I got a ton-five out of that
the other day.

343
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:07,904
- Sure.
- Better than that poxy hairdryer.

344
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:09,823
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,118
Well, that isn't it, is it?

346
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:16,871
I mean, it isn't the bikes, is it?
It's the people.

347
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,375
And the people who ride these
are states, third-class tickets.

348
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:22,585
- Do what?
- Well, rockers.

349
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:25,964
All that greasy hair and dirty clobber.
It's diabolical.

350
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:29,509
I don't give a monkey's arsehole
about mods and rockers.

351
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,387
Underneath, we're all the same.

352
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:36,599
Nah, Kev, that's it: I don't want to be
the same as everybody else.

353
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:41,521
That's why I'm a mod, see. I mean,
you gotta be somebody, ain't you?

354
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,566
Or you might as well jump in the sea
and drown.

355
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,860
That's why I joined the army.

356
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:50,196
To be different.
To get away from all this.

357
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:52,365
Don't matter where you go,

358
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,285
there's always some cunt
who wants to push you about.

359
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:56,786
Run it, please.

360
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,792
Two bob.

361
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:07,213
I'll see you.

362
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,467
- Three fours.
- No, no, that's bollocks.

363
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:14,637
- Three of a kind don't beat that.
- It bloody well does!

364
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:16,764
- Who says?
- I do.

365
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:18,975
He's right, you know, Harry.

366
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:29,903
Will you run it, please?

367
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,657
Your deal, Des.

368
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,127
I was late.

369
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:50,548
She was waiting.
In the wrong place.

370
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:54,010
And by the time I found her...

371
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,180
Could you get us some of those
French blues, then?

372
00:29:57,348 --> 00:29:59,724
I'll have to see, won't I? I dunno.

373
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,143
You in?

374
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,733
One card. Down and dirty.

375
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,237
Make a mod out of you yet, Harry, eh?

376
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:15,198
I don't think, though,
they make Levis in your size.

377
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:16,699
Bollocks.

378
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:21,996
You and me.

379
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,583
- All right, I'll go.
- Three.

380
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:31,965
- Two bob.
- For people like you.

381
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,092
- I'm out.
- So am I.

382
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,803
You are a fucking jammy bleeder, Cooper.

383
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:40,098
You're getting chicken, Des.
Look, I only had an ace.

384
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,186
I gotta go off to Broadwick Street now.

385
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:49,023
- Take some stuff up there.
- Run that film again, please.

386
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:50,775
Shall we get out?

387
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:58,950
Oh, yeah, Des, I don't like to be cruel.
Here y'are, take it all back.

388
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,744
It's yours, you won it.

389
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:04,455
That's the ten bob I owe you.

390
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:08,001
Fuck off, I ain't carrying
all that fucking change about.

391
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,253
You take it or leave it, me son.

392
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:12,588
Take it or leave it.

393
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:15,341
I'll see you later, Harry. See you, Des.

394
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:34,736
Mr Cale sent me up to collect
some stuff for Broadwick Street.

395
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:38,781
Yes. I've been waiting for you
for over an hour.

396
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,199
Yeah.

397
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:46,956
Come on, hurry up.
That stuff's got to be over there fast.

398
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:48,958
F-A-S-T.

399
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,754
Watch the cloth, moth.

400
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:55,214
What a tacky Herbert.

401
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:00,636
- Do you wanna hear it?
- Yeah.

402
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:02,555
Number two.

403
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:44,263
- Oh, boy.
- What you gonna do tonight, then?

404
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,349
Wait for a phone call, I suppose.

405
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,852
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Bye.

406
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:54,482
Wotcha, Jimmy.
What you doing here, then?

407
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,026
- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah? What for?

408
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:59,612
- I thought I'd give you a lift home.
- Great.

409
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,447
- Steph?
- What?

410
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:04,283
- You goin' to Brighton this weekend?
- Yeah. You?

411
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,953
'Course I am. Who are you going with?

412
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:09,872
Pete's taking me.
It's gonna be good, innit?

413
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,333
Yeah. Good.

414
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:15,294
You and Pete getting a bit strong, then?

415
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:18,339
Nah, 'course not.
He's a laugh, that's all.

416
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,134
Bit flash, though, ain't he?

417
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:23,594
I wouldn't be with him otherwise,
would I?

418
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:25,054
Nah.

419
00:33:25,222 --> 00:33:27,473
- Suppose not.
- Hey, you jealous?

420
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,684
- 'Course I ain't.
- Nah?

421
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:32,562
That's a pity, I thought you was.

422
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,410
- It's the technique.
- All right, boys?

423
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,746
What are we gonna do about pills?

424
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:53,958
If we're going to Brighton,
we're gonna need millions.

425
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,127
I wanna get out of me head for a start.

426
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:59,380
Wouldn't be too difficult
with your little monkey brain.

427
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:03,092
Get some rockers out their heads
when we're there, knock 'em off.

428
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,888
- I was thinking about getting a gun.
- Don't talk bloody daft.

429
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:08,973
Here, I get my suit tomorrow.

430
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,267
Only 'cause
you wanna screw Steph, innit?

431
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:12,768
Jim!

432
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:16,397
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

433
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:23,196
- Get off.
- Get outside.

434
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,323
- We're goin', aren't we?
- Let's go.

435
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:27,408
Let's go up the Goldhawk, lads.

436
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,953
Look, tomato sauce.
It's all watered down.

437
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:33,664
The rolls have got scabs on 'em.

438
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:05,988
Shit.

439
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,664
- Get off it a sec.
- Spider!

440
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:16,457
Here, look, lads.

441
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:20,044
- What's up, then?
- Dunno.

442
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:22,755
- Break down?
- Must be, the brakes are down.

443
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:25,675
- We'll see you down there, then.
- Ten minutes.

444
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:29,178
- You'd be better catching a bus!
- We will, then.

445
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,735
- Shit.
- What's the matter with it?

446
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:47,405
How am I supposed to know
what the matter is?

447
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,842
Oh, shit.

448
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:13,347
What's the matter?
Your mother's hairdryer blown up?

449
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:16,559
- Rubber band busted?
- Yeah. Let's fix it.

450
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:18,019
Let's fix it.

451
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:20,730
Hold on,
we don't do nothin' for nothin'.

452
00:36:20,897 --> 00:36:24,066
Look, why don't you piss off?
Bloody leave us alone.

453
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:27,153
Hold on, Lenny,
they don't want our help.

454
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:31,616
Which one are you? The boy or the girl?
It's hard to tell with you lot.

455
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:33,951
This one's a bird. Give us a kiss.

456
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,578
Piss off, all right?

457
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:37,288
Bastards!

458
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,710
This one's the bird!
She got tits!

459
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:45,421
Let go!

460
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:47,590
- Spider!
- OK, let's go!

461
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,842
Spider!

462
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,386
So long, sucker!

463
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,263
Fuck off!

464
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:57,516
Bloody hell.

465
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:13,616
I've just seen Spider.
He's taken a right kicking.

466
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:15,701
- What?
- Some rockers have had him.

467
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,286
- He's outside.
- Where?

468
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:19,580
On the stairs. Come on.

469
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,668
Spider, you all right, yeah?

470
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,921
What's this about rockers
kicking your head in?

471
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,632
- Gonna murder the bastards!
- You lot, come on!

472
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,967
- Come on!
- You stay there, right?

473
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:34,553
- What are we gonna do?
- Fucking kill 'em!

474
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,847
Right. Are you with me?

475
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:39,475
- I'm with you.
- They're all going to meet death!

476
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,728
We're gonna fuckin' murder! Murder!

477
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:41,370
There they fucking are!

478
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:57,970
Christ!

479
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:14,779
Fuckin' hell!

480
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:17,281
'Ave him! Fuckin' 'ave him!

481
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,493
Fucking greaser!

482
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:22,328
Jim!

483
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:24,580
You wanted it, didn't you?

484
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,459
No, no, fuck off! Leave him alone!

485
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:31,128
No, leave him alone!

486
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:39,762
Where's he going?

487
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,267
All right, run!

488
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:47,561
- Leg it!
- The fuckin' law will be here!

489
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:29,979
- What time do you call this?
- I don't know, I haven't got a watch.

490
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:32,898
Don't come funny, lad.
It's nearly midnight.

491
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,985
Don't worry, I ain't gonna turn
into a pumpkin, am I?

492
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:38,153
Anyway, you're pissed.

493
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:40,781
George, what's going on?

494
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:42,116
Cunt.

495
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:46,495
I've been sitting up for
more than an hour waiting for you.

496
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:49,248
- I can do without your clever remarks.
- George.

497
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:52,835
- Who do you think you are?
- I don't know. You tell me, eh?

498
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:56,589
You're barmy, you are,
staying out all hours.

499
00:40:56,798 --> 00:41:00,217
Getting up to God-knows-what,
dressing up like a freak.

500
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:03,470
Stand still when I'm talking to you.

501
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:06,432
Wouldn't be at all surprised
if you're not on drugs.

502
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,768
I know what you get up to
down that club, you and your mates.

503
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:14,189
You've gotta be part of a gang, haven't
you? Gotta be a mod, or this, or that.

504
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:16,525
Haven't you got a mind of your own?

505
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:20,321
I'll tell you what's wrong with you.
You're schizophrenic.

506
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:22,531
- What's that, then?
- I'll tell you.

507
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:26,827
Somebody, like you, who doesn't know
if his mind's over here or over there.

508
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:28,871
Bloody split personality.

509
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:33,667
Half your mother's family were the same.

510
00:41:33,835 --> 00:41:36,003
I suppose that's where you get it.

511
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:39,173
Your Uncle Sid
was always trying to kill himself.

512
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:41,592
And when he did,
it was a bloody accident.

513
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,553
He never knew if he was coming or going.
Bit like you.

514
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:48,015
- What happened to him, then?
- He got drowned, didn't he?

515
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:50,559
Fell down a bleedin' well in the garden.

516
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:55,397
Go on, get off to bed.

517
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:12,266
Jimmy?

518
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:14,268
Jimmy!

519
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,521
Come on, you. You're late as it is.

520
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,652
- Jimmy!
- Don't.

521
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,904
Come on, wake up!

522
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:34,663
- I'm not well, Mum.
- What?

523
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,041
I can't go to work, I'm not well.

524
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,252
Oh.
Something wrong with your head, is it?

525
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,964
Look at you, lying there
in all your clothes. It's not normal.

526
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:47,009
I can't stand here. I've gotta get on.

527
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,305
You make sure you go to the doctor
and get a certificate. You hear?

528
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:52,639
Yes.

529
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:12,201
Hang on, what about them blokes
Pete's always on about?

530
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:14,495
What, always got bags of it?

531
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:17,956
Straight out the back door
of the chemical factory?

532
00:44:18,124 --> 00:44:20,209
It's fucking rubbish.

533
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:23,087
Sort of bollocks you expect
from that flash cunt.

534
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:26,090
It's worth a try, though, innit?
I'm gonna pop...

535
00:44:26,257 --> 00:44:30,219
- It's not like you got no work to do.
- All right, George, half a minute.

536
00:44:30,386 --> 00:44:33,472
- I'll pick you up later, all right?
- Yeah, all right.

537
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:39,728
Do you want a push start?

538
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:42,231
No, thanks.

539
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:51,573
Hey, Jim, I'll be on me own bike again
tomorrow, won't I?

540
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:54,326
I'm getting the scooter back.

541
00:44:54,494 --> 00:44:58,205
- Burn the arse of your rust bucket.
- Any time.

542
00:45:18,268 --> 00:45:20,477
Butch! Jenny! It's all right.

543
00:45:20,645 --> 00:45:22,729
Go on, get back in there.

544
00:45:24,482 --> 00:45:26,608
All right, young Jim. On holiday?

545
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:29,695
Nah. Just fancied the day off.

546
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:32,281
You'll be getting like them beatniks.

547
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:35,075
Ban the bomb
and do fuck all for a living.

548
00:45:35,243 --> 00:45:38,620
You're all right, ain't you?
Just you and your Uncle Charlie.

549
00:45:38,788 --> 00:45:41,748
You don't have to bother
with a load of cunts like I do.

550
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,376
- Well, you know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

551
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:48,130
If you don't work, you don't get
no money. And I like money.

552
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:51,258
Pete, what about Brighton this weekend?

553
00:45:51,426 --> 00:45:53,427
What about it?

554
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:57,264
Pills. Me and Dave thought
you might be able to get hold of some.

555
00:45:57,432 --> 00:45:59,766
Why me? I'm not a fucking pusher.

556
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:02,728
No, no. But you know some blokes
who are, don't you?

557
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,980
Not me. Charlie's mates.

558
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,443
And I'm not about to start blabbing me
mouth off about mates of Charlie's.

559
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:13,155
They're fucking big, these blokes.
They don't mess about.

560
00:46:13,823 --> 00:46:16,450
Anyway,
I don't know why you're worrying.

561
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:19,494
- Ferdy'll have some.
- Ferdy ain't been seen, has he?

562
00:46:19,662 --> 00:46:23,916
He'll turn up. You watch, Friday night
he'll pop up like a jack-in-the-box.

563
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:26,335
Or a golliwog.

564
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:33,091
Ain't bloody here, is he?

565
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:35,510
Cunt. I wonder where he is.

566
00:46:35,678 --> 00:46:38,805
- I don't know.
- This place gives me the shits.

567
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:42,267
- Bleedin' nig-nogs everywhere.
- Shut up.

568
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:44,686
It's like bleedin' Calcutta round here.

569
00:46:44,854 --> 00:46:46,939
Calcutta's in India.

570
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:49,942
West India,
that's where they bleedin' come from.

571
00:46:52,195 --> 00:46:54,321
What's so funny?

572
00:47:00,203 --> 00:47:03,372
- Just who are you looking for?
- Is Ferdy in?

573
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:05,666
He not here. Him gone out.

574
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,668
Thank you.

575
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,255
- Looking for Ferdy.
- Yeah.

576
00:47:11,422 --> 00:47:12,506
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:47:12,715 --> 00:47:14,216
He's gone out.

578
00:47:14,425 --> 00:47:16,510
Oh... yeah.

579
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:21,515
Stitchin' me up and all, the bloke.
Fucking...

580
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:23,558
Peter Fenton?

581
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:26,812
Peter!

582
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:29,564
Thanks.

583
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:33,110
Hello, Peter Fenton. Who is it?

584
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:38,490
- What d'you wanna ring me up here for?
- Listen, you cunt,

585
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:42,244
tell us where we can find these blokes
or we're stuck for Brighton.

586
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:44,121
Yeah, OK. This time.

587
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:13,775
- Hold this, then.
- What for?

588
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:16,361
I ain't going in there with me parka on,
am I?

589
00:48:22,285 --> 00:48:23,785
Hey, Jim.

590
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,214
Excuse me.

591
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,972
- What d'you want, son?
- Is Harry North about?

592
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,850
- Who are you, then?
- I've got a message for him.

593
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:49,728
Hang about a minute, all right?

594
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:04,242
Come through here. Come through.

595
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,078
Come through.

596
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:08,663
Over there.

597
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:10,791
Through here.

598
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,346
That's him over there in the grey suit.

599
00:49:24,514 --> 00:49:26,640
Go on, you're all right. Go on.

600
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:33,271
What can I do for you, son?

601
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,023
- Me Uncle Charlie.
- Who?

602
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,025
Charlie Fenton, he said...

603
00:49:38,694 --> 00:49:41,738
- Are you Charlie's boy?
- His nephew, yeah.

604
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:44,074
Oh, his nephew. What's your name, son?

605
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:45,867
Jimmy.

606
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:49,579
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to meet any one of the Fentons.

607
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:52,207
- Now, do you want a drink, son?
- No, thanks.

608
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,043
- I gotta get going soon.
- What can I do for you?

609
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,965
Listen, you can have a talk here.
We're all pals.

610
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:03,051
- I wanted some pills.
- Oh.

611
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:06,680
What do you want?
Purple hearts? Blues? Dexedrine?

612
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:09,683
Some blues. I've got a tenner.

613
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:11,726
No, not here, son.

614
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:14,896
Teddy, come here.

615
00:50:17,024 --> 00:50:20,819
This is Teddy. Go for a walk with him
and he'll do the business for you.

616
00:50:20,987 --> 00:50:24,739
- All right.
- Give my regards to your Uncle Charlie.

617
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,659
Pillhead.

618
00:50:27,827 --> 00:50:29,911
Come on, Ronnie.

619
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:32,080
Come on, Ron!

620
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,833
Tosser.

621
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:39,421
Chalk...

622
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:55,770
It's all there.

623
00:51:06,157 --> 00:51:09,618
250 leapers! This'll see us through
till Christmas, eh?

624
00:51:09,785 --> 00:51:13,038
- Show me.
- One for the road, eh?

625
00:51:13,498 --> 00:51:15,624
Come on, hurry up.

626
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:19,044
That ain't a blue! That's paraffin.

627
00:51:20,922 --> 00:51:23,798
We've been done,
that's my three quid down the drain.

628
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:25,675
Yeah, and mine!

629
00:51:26,636 --> 00:51:28,887
Let's do the bastard's motor.

630
00:51:29,096 --> 00:51:30,514
Come on.

631
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:35,852
Get out the way!

632
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:39,105
Come on! Go!

633
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:43,401
You on?

634
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:47,405
Wankers!

635
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:06,091
Nice.

636
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:09,844
Give it a shove. Go on, shove it, man.

637
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,890
Nice one.
You're fucking making a racket.

638
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:16,643
- Do we have to do this?
- Course we do.

639
00:52:16,811 --> 00:52:19,729
We don't wanna leave fingerprints
all over the gaff.

640
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:21,690
They'll catch us on the smell.

641
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:25,151
Shut up.

642
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:36,204
We must be able to find some blues here.

643
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:38,707
Look at that.

644
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:40,834
Oh, yes.

645
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,214
- Dave.
- What?

646
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:47,841
Come here.

647
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:57,058
Shut up!

648
00:52:57,518 --> 00:52:59,894
- Fucking shut up!
- All right.

649
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,899
This place...

650
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:09,696
- Here, Jim, I just had a thought.
- What?

651
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:11,781
- Footprints.
- Footprints. What?

652
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:14,492
You got lines on the back of your feet.

653
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,786
There must be thousands of pills here.

654
00:53:16,954 --> 00:53:18,455
Or millions.

655
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:22,709
Nothing's there.
I'm gonna search in there.

656
00:53:22,877 --> 00:53:25,587
I'm putting me socks on. I ain't stupid.

657
00:53:30,843 --> 00:53:32,302
Police!

658
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:42,395
Hey, lads, look at these.

659
00:53:42,605 --> 00:53:45,774
- Johnnies, hundreds of 'em.
- Chuck us a couple of packets.

660
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:48,943
- Got something planned for tonight?
- 'Course I have.

661
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:12,509
Oh! Fucking yellows.

662
00:54:12,718 --> 00:54:15,303
Chalky, what you doing?
Come and give us a hand.

663
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:17,555
Not taking no chances, am I?

664
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:23,269
Come on, shut up.
Let's get down to it, eh?

665
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:32,237
I've found 'em. They're blues.

666
00:54:32,822 --> 00:54:34,989
- I found some blues.
- There's not many.

667
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:39,244
- Perhaps someone's been nickin' 'em.
- Fucking hell!

668
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:43,832
Hang on!

669
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:46,084
Chalky, come on.

670
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:48,294
Just getting something for me mum.

671
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,257
- I'm dropping all the blues.
- Just get out.

672
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:06,312
- All right.
- One and tuppence.

673
00:55:06,522 --> 00:55:09,149
OK. And you behave yourself tonight.

674
00:55:09,316 --> 00:55:12,110
I'll try.
I'll try and behave myself tonight.

675
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:15,572
I'm flying. Terrific, ain't they?

676
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,033
- Did we have it off, or what?
- Just what the doctor ordered.

677
00:55:19,535 --> 00:55:21,911
- We done your chemist tonight.
- You didn't.

678
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,329
I was gonna phone you.

679
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:26,499
Why didn't you?
I coulda told you where everything was.

680
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,918
Got you a Pepsi.

681
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:30,795
- And a present.
- What is it?

682
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:34,716
- You nicked 'em, didn't you?
- You are now handling stolen goods.

683
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:36,885
Here y'are, I'll give you some more.

684
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:43,141
Listen,
d'you fancy taking me home later?

685
00:55:55,154 --> 00:55:57,113
What about Pete, then?

686
00:55:57,281 --> 00:55:59,407
I'll worry about Pete.

687
00:55:59,575 --> 00:56:04,245
But if you tell him, I will never, ever
speak to you again, right?

688
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,001
Don't worry, I won't tell him.

689
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,422
And I'm still gonna go down
to Brighton with him.

690
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,925
- Yeah.
- I've said I would, haven't I?

691
00:56:18,594 --> 00:56:20,595
Yeah, I suppose so.

00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:50,458
How much d'you get?

698
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:55,630
Mr Fulford had a few words to say about
your unexplained absence yesterday.

699
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:58,716
- Like what?
- Like don't do it again.

700
00:56:58,884 --> 00:57:03,388
Unless you want to end up hearing him
read the riot act. I take it you don't.

701
00:57:03,597 --> 00:57:05,682
No, I'd rather be dead, Mr Cale.

702
00:57:07,476 --> 00:57:09,269
All right.

703
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,896
Off you go. You too, Eric.

704
00:57:15,442 --> 00:57:17,527
Have a nice weekend.

705
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:26,244
It's just the front
I'm a bit dodgy about.

706
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:28,788
The only way to keep that up
is with lacquer.

707
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:31,249
- I don't want any lacquer.
- Just a drop.

708
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:34,210
- Poofs wear lacquer, don't they?
- I wear lacquer.

709
00:57:34,378 --> 00:57:36,421
That's what I mean, innit?

710
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:39,215
- There y'are.
- Cheers.

711
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:41,718
My bird'll pull that back for me.

712
00:57:41,886 --> 00:57:44,345
As long as that's all she pulls back.

713
00:57:45,097 --> 00:57:47,599
- Right. Usual miracle?
- Watch the neck.

714
00:57:47,766 --> 00:57:49,601
Plenty of lacquer for him.

715
00:57:49,768 --> 00:57:52,186
You know the hair falls? Down the back.

716
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:54,355
- Know what I mean?
- All right.

717
00:57:54,523 --> 00:57:56,733
- See you, then, Dan.
- Yeah, cheers, Jim.

718
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:59,360
- Brighton tomorrow?
- Yeah, see you there.

719
00:58:01,363 --> 00:58:03,531
Mum? Mum?

720
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:06,034
Where've you put
all them old newspapers?

721
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:08,328
Are you gonna get my carpets wet again?

722
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:10,872
No, I've given 'em
a really good wringing out.

723
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,790
They're under the sink.

724
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:16,002
Gordon Bennett!

725
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,212
What have you got on?

726
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,716
Is this some kind of new fashion
I haven't heard about?

727
00:58:21,884 --> 00:58:24,385
- Sopping wet trousers?
- They're Levis.

728
00:58:24,553 --> 00:58:27,347
Never mind what they are,
they're bleeding wet.

729
00:58:27,514 --> 00:58:30,308
You've gotta shrink 'em on you
so they fit right.

730
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:36,898
He's definitely getting worse.

731
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:56,042
- What's this rubbish, then?
- Ready Steady Go!

732
00:58:56,752 --> 00:58:59,253
- Ready what?
- Ready Steady Go!

733
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:01,339
Ready Steady Go!?

734
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,133
Bunch of louts.

735
00:59:08,555 --> 00:59:10,431
Bloody moron.

736
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,477
I suppose they wear wet jeans
n'all, do they?

737
00:59:16,772 --> 00:59:21,359
Is that how you're supposed to play
a guitar now, then?

738
00:59:21,527 --> 00:59:23,695
Oh, gawd help us.

739
00:59:23,862 --> 00:59:26,114
Here, have you seen this?

740
00:59:26,281 --> 00:59:28,449
I haven't got time for all that rubbish.

741
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:32,954
I can sing better than that little ape.

742
00:59:33,122 --> 00:59:35,456
Call that singing?

743
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:37,709
Sounds like a drowned dog.

744
00:59:49,054 --> 00:59:51,305
That'll make you deaf, you know.

Good morning, it's 6.01,
and here is the news.

750
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:21,961
After yesterday's session at the
conference, the Colonial Secretary

751
01:00:22,129 --> 01:00:26,090
commented that he hoped for a speedy
transition to independence in Aden.

752
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:28,926
The Bank Holiday
started in earnest last night,

753
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:32,513
with thousands of motorists
heading towards the south coast.

754
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:36,059
Traffic was reported heavy on the A127,
the Southend Road,

755
01:00:36,226 --> 01:00:39,979
and there were jams on the M1
southbound, causing severe delays.

756
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:43,816
Shopkeepers in Brighton,
fearing a reoccurrence of disturbances

757
01:00:43,984 --> 01:00:48,404
caused by rival gangs in other seaside
resorts, put up shutters last night.

758
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:52,658
A spokesperson for the shopkeepers
said while they weren't expecting...

759
01:01:09,718 --> 01:01:12,845
- Watch it, Dave!
- I'll burn you off any day, son!

760
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:15,223
I thought you got that thing fixed up!

761
01:01:18,894 --> 01:01:20,937
Show off!

762
01:01:26,693 --> 01:01:28,069
Oh, shit.

763
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:37,954
Fuck off!

764
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:41,082
- Flash pig.
- He thinks he's Davy Crockett.

765
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:45,461

768
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:03,396
- Chalky, you all right?
- Hey, Chalky!

769
01:02:03,564 --> 01:02:05,857
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Anything broken?

770
01:02:06,024 --> 01:02:08,526
- No.
- Shame, eh? Shame.

771
01:02:08,694 --> 01:02:11,612
Nah, it looks all right.
Looked good from back there.

01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:08,336
♪ Don't come back

782
01:03:24,228 --> 01:03:27,188
Look at that. That is Brighton, my sons!

783
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:15,319
Blindin'. T'riffic. All right, lads!

784
01:04:15,487 --> 01:04:17,071
Nice one. Ron!

785
01:04:18,615 --> 01:04:20,741
Brilliant! Ace!

786
01:04:22,452 --> 01:04:24,078
Here they are!

787
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:32,920
- Let's get down there. Come on.
- What about this? Everyone's here.

788
01:04:33,088 --> 01:04:35,172
- This is great.
- Great. Brilliant.

789
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:38,009
Hey, look, look, there's Bonzo.

790
01:04:38,176 --> 01:04:41,387
Bonzo!

791
01:04:41,555 --> 01:04:44,932
- So, when did you get down here?
- About half an hour ago.

792
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,393
We left this morning,
before it was light.

793
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:50,271
- What was it like?
- It was dark, weren't it.

794
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:52,398
Cor, look at him.

795
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:56,527
- Don't he look smart?
- Wallop!

796
01:04:56,695 --> 01:04:58,779
Look at the scooter.

797
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:01,240
That is ace!

798
01:05:05,454 --> 01:05:08,706
So, what happened to you last night?

799
01:05:08,874 --> 01:05:12,585
- That'd be telling, wouldn't it?
- That would be telling, would it?

800
01:05:15,297 --> 01:05:16,672
Chalky.

801
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:23,721
Thanks for waiting. Bleedin' turd.

802
01:05:29,353 --> 01:05:30,811
Where'd the bird go?

803
01:06:13,188 --> 01:06:15,022
He's doing well.

804
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:17,316
How many you want?

805
01:06:18,026 --> 01:06:20,027
He's out of his head.

806
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:31,247
Come on.

807
01:06:39,256 --> 01:06:41,215
- You come up?
- I'm really up there.

808
01:06:41,383 --> 01:06:43,217
Fucking great!

809
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:47,721
- Greenwich Village.
- Where?

810
01:06:47,889 --> 01:06:50,766
Greenwich Village.
It's a commune in New York.

811
01:07:10,495 --> 01:07:12,580
The geezer with the hair, man.

812
01:07:12,747 --> 01:07:14,039
Oi, Dave.

813
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:16,834
The one with the hair.
Let's go and watch him.

814
01:07:17,002 --> 01:07:19,253
- Jim?
- I'll see you over there.

815
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:21,422
Monkey, come and dance.

816
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:16,769
- All right, there, Steph?
- Hello.

817
01:08:17,521 --> 01:08:20,814
Great dancer, eh?
He must be the Ace Face.

818
01:08:20,982 --> 01:08:23,651
- Good looking.
- You wanna dance with a face?

819
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:25,819
- All right.
- Come on, then.

820
01:08:25,987 --> 01:08:27,279
See ya.

821
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:40,209
Come on.

822
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:42,419
Come on, let's dance over there.

823
01:08:42,587 --> 01:08:45,923
- No, let's dance over here.
- I wanna watch him. Come on.

824
01:08:46,091 --> 01:08:49,718
- Why d'you wanna go?
- I wanna dance. Dance with yourself.

825
01:09:14,536 --> 01:09:16,829
- Look at him.
- What's he think he's doing?

826
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,377
- Right, out the way, son.
- Out the way, come on.

827
01:09:24,713 --> 01:09:26,046
Fuck off.

828
01:09:38,393 --> 01:09:39,893
Oi, bouncers!

829
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:48,819
Come on, out! You stupid little bastard.

830
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:51,238
- Could've killed yourself.
- Leave him.

831
01:09:57,829 --> 01:09:59,246
Jimmy!

832
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:00,414
Monkey!

833
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,504
Get out and stay out.

834
01:11:00,183 --> 01:11:01,475
Bit of a girl, was she?

835
01:11:01,643 --> 01:11:03,811
- Boys, where we going?
- Come on a ride.

836
01:11:03,978 --> 01:11:06,730
No, I'm gonna find somewhere to kip.
You seen Jimmy?

837
01:11:06,898 --> 01:11:09,483
Last time I seen him,
he was getting kicked out.

838
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:12,444
- Fenton's pulled.
- Don't it make you sick?

839
01:11:12,612 --> 01:11:14,905
Got his sleeping arrangements sorted.

840
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:18,409
- Chalk, let's ride.
- Nah, we wanna be fresh for tomorrow.

841
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:20,577
- See you, Dave.
- Cheerio, Spider.

842
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:24,415
Steph, you coming with us, then?

843
01:11:24,582 --> 01:11:27,334
No, I don't fancy
kipping on dirty floors.

844
01:11:27,502 --> 01:11:29,670
Going to a bed and breakfast, ain't we?

845
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:30,838
Bye.

846
01:11:31,047 --> 01:11:33,674
I wouldn't say no
to bed and breakfast either.

847
01:11:33,842 --> 01:11:36,927
- I ain't got no dough.
- Not you. Them.

848
01:11:37,095 --> 01:11:38,846
Oh. Yeah, not half.

849
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:42,850
Can you imagine it?
Legs wrapped round your face.

850
01:11:43,017 --> 01:11:44,810
Fucking amazing.

851
01:11:45,437 --> 01:11:47,521
Bit of all right, is that Steph.

852
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:49,648
- So where we gonna kip.
- I dunno.

853
01:11:49,858 --> 01:11:51,900
I've got no fucking idea.

854
01:11:57,282 --> 01:11:59,533
What we gonna do? Go back up?

855
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:01,869
- On the beach.
- Oh, yeah, can you swim?

856
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:11,128
I don't wanna go to sleep anyway.
Do you?

857
01:12:17,844 --> 01:12:19,928
What d'you reckon?

858
01:12:23,516 --> 01:12:25,100
It's cheap.

859
01:12:39,407 --> 01:12:41,533
It's a bit of a shithouse, innit?

860
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:44,244
I dunno,
I've never slept in a shithouse.

861
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:46,205
- What d'you reckon?
- Well...

862
01:12:46,372 --> 01:12:48,916
- Make your fucking mind up.
- Fucking hell.

863
01:12:52,253 --> 01:12:54,171
Sorry. Is there room?

864
01:12:54,923 --> 01:12:56,840
- Fucking hell.
- Sorry.

865
01:12:57,008 --> 01:12:58,967
Who's farted?

866
01:15:00,965 --> 01:15:03,383
Come on, then, let's make a move.

867
01:15:11,726 --> 01:15:13,685
Come on, get a move on.

868
01:15:13,853 --> 01:15:17,022
- I've heard there's a few mods about.
- See you down there.

869
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,115
Fucking hell.

870
01:15:30,411 --> 01:15:32,412
- What d'you want?
- Egg sandwich.

871
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:35,624
Spider! You shithouse!

872
01:15:38,336 --> 01:15:40,963
Hello, girls. Where's Jim?

873
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:42,756
He's over there.

874
01:15:42,924 --> 01:15:44,633
How's the human cannonball...

875
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:47,177
Leave me hair alone, will you, Dave?

876
01:15:52,558 --> 01:15:54,935
We go down this beach hut.
It's dark, right?

877
01:15:55,103 --> 01:15:58,271
We wake up, there's greasers everywhere.
Right, Dave?

878
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:01,483
Yeah. They was all having a screw
with some bird.

879
01:16:01,651 --> 01:16:04,820
- Bit rough, was she?
- He don't know, he only saw her arse.

880
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:07,114
Yeah, but that wasn't rough.

881
01:16:07,281 --> 01:16:09,449
Well, apart from the splinters.

882
01:16:09,617 --> 01:16:12,869
One of 'em was the geezer
that rode me off the bike yesterday.

883
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:15,122
He's on my fucking list. He's dead.

884
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:19,793
- It's all right if I sit down, then?
- Yeah.

885
01:16:21,462 --> 01:16:23,588
What you got the hump about?

886
01:16:23,756 --> 01:16:25,841
So why are you so humpy?

887
01:16:26,342 --> 01:16:28,427
It's nothing.

888
01:16:28,594 --> 01:16:31,179
Just looking at the sea, that's all.

889
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:33,181
Oh, Christ Almighty.

890
01:16:34,142 --> 01:16:36,101
Take your feet off the table.

891
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,103
Piss off.

892
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:41,023
Just watch it, or you're out.

893
01:16:44,902 --> 01:16:47,487
- Where'd you get to, then?
- Nowhere.

894
01:16:47,655 --> 01:16:49,781
I just kipped on the beach.

895
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:52,659
You're fucking mad, you are,
getting chucked out.

896
01:16:52,827 --> 01:16:56,038
You should have stayed around.
You would've been well in.

897
01:16:56,205 --> 01:17:00,042
- What d'you mean?
- She was there on her Jack Jones.

898
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:02,085
- Steph?
- Yeah.

899
01:17:03,379 --> 01:17:06,214
Fucking Fenton gets off
with this beatnik chick.

900
01:17:06,424 --> 01:17:09,176
And she's all on her own, ain't she.
I tell you...

901
01:17:09,343 --> 01:17:11,762
I would've been up her
like a fucking ferret.

902
01:17:12,138 --> 01:17:14,848
Well, if I hadn't know that you and her
were so...

903
01:17:15,016 --> 01:17:18,351
So what?
I ain't gone on her, you know.

904
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:21,480
Leave it out,
everybody knows you fancy her.

905
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:24,524
I reckon she's a right good bunk-up,
lads.

906
01:17:24,692 --> 01:17:26,193
You animal!

907
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:01,478
- Hi.
- All right, Steph?

908
01:18:01,646 --> 01:18:03,730
- Great, innit?
- Where's Pete, then?

909
01:18:03,898 --> 01:18:07,317
- I dunno. Don't really care.
- Don't really care. Dave!

910
01:18:07,485 --> 01:18:08,485
Come on.

911
01:18:09,904 --> 01:18:11,863
We are the mods! We are the mods!

912
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:14,282
We are, we are, we are the mods!

913
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,992
We are the mods! We are the mods!

914
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,245
We are, we are, we are the mods!

915
01:18:18,412 --> 01:18:22,249
- We are the mods!
- Fucking wankers!

916
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,292
We are the mods! We are the mods!

917
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,294
We are, we are, we are the mods!

918
01:18:26,462 --> 01:18:28,380
We are the mods! We are the mods!

919
01:18:28,548 --> 01:18:30,507
We are, we are, we are the mods!

920
01:18:30,675 --> 01:18:32,467
We are the mods! We are the mods!

921
01:18:32,677 --> 01:18:34,636
We are, we are, we are the mods!

922
01:18:34,804 --> 01:18:37,931
That's the geezer that rode me
off the road yesterday.

923
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:40,725
Let's fucking have 'em!

924
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,399
Shut those fucking doors!

925
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:51,194
Have him!

926
01:18:57,785 --> 01:18:59,619
Pete, stop 'em!

927
01:19:07,962 --> 01:19:10,130
Get somebody here quick.

928
01:19:10,298 --> 01:19:12,132
What's that? Stop!

929
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,551
Jesus Christ, they've gone... Oi!

930
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:16,636
Get 'em in here quick.

931
01:19:17,972 --> 01:19:20,098
What's going on here?

932
01:19:23,519 --> 01:19:25,312
Over the edge.

933
01:19:34,405 --> 01:19:37,365
- Jimmy!
- All right!

934
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:40,493
I was there! The mods! We were there!

935
01:19:40,745 --> 01:19:42,704
Look! Dan did that!

936
01:19:42,872 --> 01:19:45,624
There was a geezer, I tell you,
I went crack!

937
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:46,958
Crack!

938
01:19:51,797 --> 01:19:53,089
You bastards!

to pay a fine of £75.

Where'd you get these?

I dunno. Someone gave 'em to me.

Did he?
And of course, you had to take 'em.

No.

fairly incomprehensible.

01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:50,217
I feel I must warn you, Cooper,

01:33:50,385 --> 01:33:54,847
that we cannot tolerate this kind of

01:35:15,929 --> 01:35:17,972
Dunno. Well, how many you got?

1081
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,850

- Yeah, I'll have the lot.

01:35:21,059 --> 01:35:22,768
- What?
- You can't afford it.

1083
01:35:24,187 --> 01:35:26,355

Golden handshake, innit?
Two weeks' money.

1085

Fancied something outdoors.

1095
01:36:10,525 --> 01:36:12,151
So do I, eh?

1096
01:36:13,987 --> 01:36:15,988
She's not bad, is she?

1097
01:36:16,156 --> 01:36:18,324
I found her by the road in Brighton.

1098
01:36:32,714 --> 01:36:34,840
Maybe there's some trouble at home.

1099
01:36:58,365 --> 01:37:00,950
See you found yourself
a new little boy, then.

1100
01:37:04,537 --> 01:37:07,331
Hey, Jimmy. I hope you find a new job.

1101
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:09,750
Oh, yeah?

1102
01:37:10,377 --> 01:37:13,045
I could always get you a job
on the rubbish carts.

1103
01:37:15,006 --> 01:37:18,342
She says you're good
at going up and down in alleyways.

1104
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:34,358
If I see you round here again
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1105
01:37:34,526 --> 01:37:36,735
- Get off me!
- What's the matter with you?

1106
01:37:36,903 --> 01:37:39,738
- Cunts! Get off me! You're not a face!
- Piss off!

1107
01:37:39,906 --> 01:37:42,283
- You piss off!
- Forget her, Jimmy.

1108
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:45,786
You shut up and piss off!
You're all wankers and cunts!

1109
01:37:45,954 --> 01:37:47,913
Wankers and cunts!

1110
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:37,463
- Jimmy! Pack that in and clear off!
- What do you want, you old spunker?

1111
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:39,340
Right.

1112
01:38:39,507 --> 01:38:42,217
What d'you want? What d'you want?

1113
01:38:49,642 --> 01:38:51,935

1114
01:39:01,488 --> 01:39:04,990
Are you mad? What's the matter with you?
You're worse than he is.

1115
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:06,867
- Go back to bed.
- Come on in.

1116
01:39:07,035 --> 01:39:11,038
- You wanna wake the whole street up?
- It's a bit late to worry about that.

1117
01:39:11,206 --> 01:39:13,999
If he comes near this house again
I'll kill him.

1118
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:18,712
Do we have to shout about it down here?
Do they all have to know our business?

1119
01:40:54,434 --> 01:40:57,186
- Hello, Steph.
- What you doin' here?

1120
01:40:58,771 --> 01:41:01,356
- I wanted to see you.
- Well, now you've seen me.

1121
01:41:01,524 --> 01:41:05,027
- Wait a minute, will you?
- What you gonna do? Beat me up?

1122
01:41:05,987 --> 01:41:08,614
All right, what d'you want?
Walk, I'm late.

1123
01:41:09,115 --> 01:41:12,409
Well, I left home last night.

1124
01:41:13,286 --> 01:41:16,330
- I kipped out, didn't I?
- In some nuthouse?

1125
01:41:16,498 --> 01:41:18,499
Look, I ain't mad, you know.

1126
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:20,709
What is wrong with you, then?

1127
01:41:20,919 --> 01:41:22,085
Well, I dunno,

1128
01:41:22,253 --> 01:41:26,423
it's just it seems like everything's
going backwards, that's all, Steph.

1129
01:41:28,384 --> 01:41:30,969
You sure it's not you
that's going backwards?

1130
01:41:31,137 --> 01:41:33,305
No, it's just...

1131
01:41:33,473 --> 01:41:35,641
I can't think straight, that's all.

1132
01:41:35,808 --> 01:41:38,894
I mean, nothing seems right,
apart from Brighton.

1133
01:41:39,062 --> 01:41:42,981
I mean, Brighton was OK.
Going to court with the Ace and that.

1134
01:41:43,149 --> 01:41:45,817
And, like, I was a mod there, you know?

1135
01:41:45,985 --> 01:41:50,113
- I mean that's something, innit, eh?
- Oh, what are you talking about?

1136
01:41:50,281 --> 01:41:54,409
Brighton was a laugh. That's why we
went down. It was a giggle, that's all.

1137
01:41:54,577 --> 01:41:57,955
Oh, yeah? And me and you, then?

1138
01:41:58,122 --> 01:42:00,791
- Was that just a giggle?
- What do you think?

1139
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:05,003
All right, so I fancied you.
We had it off together.

1140
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:08,507
- But that don't mean nothing, does it?
- It did to fucking me!

1141
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:10,842
Well, I can't help that, Jimmy, can I?

1142
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:13,512
If I'd known
you were gonna go off your nut...

1143
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,847
I told you, I ain't fucking mad, right?

1144
01:42:16,015 --> 01:42:17,849
No, not much. Look at you.

1145
01:42:18,017 --> 01:42:21,311
One minute you're all right,
the next you're going stupid.

1146
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:25,232
You can't even have a bit of the other
without kicking your mate's head in.

1147
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,693
Just leave me alone, all right?

1148
01:42:28,194 --> 01:42:31,738
- Steph, please.
- Look, fuck off!

1149
01:42:32,865 --> 01:42:35,993
