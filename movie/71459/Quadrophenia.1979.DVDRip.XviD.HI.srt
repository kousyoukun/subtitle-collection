Nah, just fancied the day off.

- What is it?

You nicked 'em, didn't you?

813
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,758
You're handling stolen goods.
I'll give you some more.

814
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,909
Listen, d'you fancy

What about Pete, then?

816
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,993
I'll worry about Pete.

817
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,236
But if you tell him, I'll never
ever speak to you again, right?

818
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,676
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

819
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,279
And I'm still gonna down
to Brighton with him.

The only way you'll keep

- No, no lacquer.
- Just a little?

They're Levis.

Good morning, it's 6.01. Here
are the main points in the news.

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,359
After yesterday's conference
session the Colonial Secretary

commented that he hoped for
independence in Aden in a year.

The Bank Holiday started
in earnest last night,

903
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,994
with motorists taking advantage
of the fine weather,

904
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,718
heading towards
the South Coast resorts.

905
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,997
Traffic was reported heavy on
the A127, the Southend road,

906
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,914
and there were jams southbound
on the M1, causing long delays.

907
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,560
Shopkeepers in the Brighton
area, fearing a reoccurrence

908
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,837
of disturbances by groups of
rival youths in other resorts,

01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,950
Yeah, we went to court together

1292
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,315
Yeah.

1293
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,155
Yeah.

1294
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,995
Christ,
he's really weird tonight.

1295
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,877
I couldn't give a shit.

1296
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:56,755
Ferdy?

1297
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,355
Jim?

1298
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,199
You got any blues?

1299
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,998
Yeah, how many you want?

1300
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,992
Dunno. How many you got?

1301
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,672
A ton. French blues.

1302
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,875
I'll have the lot.

1303
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,155
- What?
- You can't afford it!

1304
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,071
Where'd you get all that, then?

1305
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,672
Golden hand shake, innit?

1306
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,113
Two weeks money.

1307
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,397
Told him to stuff the job
right up his arse.

1308
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,229
[Ferdy]
You sure you want the whole bag?

1309
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,436
Yeah. Why not, eh? Why not?

1310
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,509
All right.

1311
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,669
[Ferdy] A fiver.

1312
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,435
Fiver.

1313
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,110
What you gonna do with that lot?

1314
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,156
Start a one-man riot?

1315
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,309
Yeah. I might.

1316
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,472
Why'd you chuck your job?

1317
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,198
'Cos I felt like it.

1318
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,952
Well, you're bleedin' nutty.

1319
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,235
You was on a cushy number.

1320
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,880
Look, don't give it
all that, right?

1321
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,111
I just got fed up.
Fancied something outdoors.

1322
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,673
So do I.

1323
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,278
She's not bad, is she?

1324
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,999
I found her by the road
in Brighton.

1325
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:43,238
See you found yourself
a new little boy, then?

1326
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,674
Hey, Jimmy?

1327
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,716
Hope you find a new job.

1328
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,474
Oh, yeah?

1329
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,632
I could get you a job
on the rubbish carts?

1330
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,793
You're good at going
up and down in alleys.

1331
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,676
[Shouting]

1332
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:15,715
If I see you round 'ere again
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1333
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,791
- Get off me!
- What's the matter?

1334
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,749
You're not a face!

1335
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,751
- Piss off!
- You piss off!

1336
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:22,795
Forget her, Jimmy!

1337
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,237
Shut up and piss off. You're all
wankers and cunts. Wankers!

1338
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,831
[Knocks on door]

1339
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,155
Jimmy!
Pack that in and clear off!

1340
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,435
What d'you want,
you old spunker, eh?

1341
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:20,274
[Shouts] Eh? What d'you
want? What d'you want?

1342
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,116
I'll have you,
you little bastard!

1343
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,869
[Mum] Are you mad?

1344
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,713
What's the matter with you?
You're worse than he is!

1345
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,755
Come on in!

1346
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,637
[Dad]
You'll wake the whole street.

1347
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,915
[Mum]
It's a bit late for that!

1348
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,514
[Dad] If he comes
here again I'll kill him!

1349
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,239
[Mum] Can't you
come in and talk about it?

1350
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,629
Do they all have to know
our business?

1351
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,113
[Dad coughs]

1352
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,115
Hello, Steph.

1353
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,118
What you doin' here?

1354
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,353
I wanted to see you.

1355
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,668
You've seen me, OK?

1356
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,557
Wait a minute, will ya?

1357
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,756
What you gonna do? Beat me up?

1358
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,956
What d'you want?
Come on, I'm late.

1359
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,675
Well... I left home last night.

1360
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,751
I kipped out, didn't I?

1361
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,193
In some nuthouse?

1362
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,998
Look, I ain't mad!

1363
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,469
What is wrong with you, then?

1364
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,549
Well, I dunno.

1365
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:57,076
It's just... it seems like
everything's going backwards.

1366
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,115
Steph?

1367
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,636
You sure it's not you
going backwards?

1368
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,315
No, it's just... I can't
think straight, that's all.

1369
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,790
I mean, nothing seems right,
apart from Brighton.

1370
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,998
Brighton was OK, going to court
with the Ace and that.

1371
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,514
I was a mod there, you know?

1372
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,511
I mean, that's something,
innit, eh?

1373
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,716
What are you talkin' about?

1374
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,553
Brighton was a laugh,
that's why we went down there.

1375
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,991
Oh, yeah. And me and you, then?
Was that just a giggle?

1376
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,559
Oh, what do you think?

1377
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,352
All right, so I fancied you.

1378
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,318
We had it off.
But that don't mean nothin'.

1379
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,072
It did to fuckin' me.

1380
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,071
I can't help that, can I?

1381
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,628
If I'd known you'd go mad,
I wouldn't have.

1382
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,314
I told you, I ain't
fuckin' mad, right?

1383
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,038
No, not much. Look at you?

1384
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,192
One minute you're all right,
next minute you're going stupid.

1385
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,750
You can't have a bit without
kicking your mates' head in.

1386
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,354
Just leave me alone,
Jimmy! All right?

1387
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,795
Steph, please. Steph, please!

1388
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,233
Fuck off!

1389
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,598

What the bloody hell you doin'?

01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,473
We could've killed you!

1395
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,709
Hey?

1396
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,515
Look at this.

1397
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,957
Ah, fuckin' hell!
Look what you've done!

1398
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,758
You cunts!

1399
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,558
[Driver] Why didn't you stop?

1400
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,437
You've killed me scooter!

1401
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,954
Fuck off! Leave it alone!
Get off it!

1402
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,792
- Only a dent...
- Fuck off!

1403
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,835
Get off it!

1404
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,635

Get off! Get off it!

1407
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,188
There it is.
It's on the floor now.

1408
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,679
You're lucky you weren't killed.

1409
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,194
- Fuckin' lucky, am I?
- 'Course you are.

- I didn't see you.
